We\n\nfind no  error and affirm essentially for  the reasons stated\n\nin the district court's memorandum  and order dated March 17,\n\n1993.    Wood   admittedly  received  the   Equal  Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission's  determination and  90-day right-to-\n\nsue notice on  September 21, 1990.  This  complaint was filed\n\n91 days  later, on  December 21, 1990.   Compliance  with the\n\nTitle VII time  for filing a federal suit,  42 U.S.C.  2000e-\n\n5(f)(1), is  a statutory  prerequisite: a  complaint must  be\n\nfiled  within 90  days of  receipt of  the EEOC  right-to-sue\n                                  \n\nletter.     \"In  the   absence  of  a   recognized  equitable\n\nconsideration, the  court cannot extend the limitation period\n\nby even one day.\"  Rice  v.
