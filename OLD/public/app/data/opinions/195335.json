Plaintiff Johnny  Lewis appeals,  pro\n                    \n\nse, from a summary judgment dismissing his employment\n\ndiscrimination   action.     Lewis  alleges   that  defendant\n\nGillette, Co.,  unlawfully harassed  him over a  several year\n\nperiod,  and  ultimately  discharged  him   from  employment,\n\nbecause  he   testified  against   the  company  at   a  race\n\ndiscrimination  arbitration  hearing.    His  complaint  also\n\nasserts  race  discrimination and  breach of  contract claims\n\nunder  Massachussets and  federal law.   Lewis  abandoned the\n\nrace  discrimination claim  below.   On appeal  he challenges\n\nonly  the dismissal of his two retaliation claims under Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch. 151B,   4.\n\n          The record  shows that Lewis, who  is black, worked\n\nat Gillette in various line jobs from 1972 to 1987.  Sometime\n\nin 1984 or 1985, he testified  on behalf of a co-worker at an\n\narbitration   hearing  held  pursuant   to  a   class  action\n\nsettlement of  race discrimination claims  by black employees\n\nagainst Gillette.  He claims that thereafter a group campaign\n\nof retaliatory  harassment was launched against  him by white\n\nemployees at  the plant.   Those involved  allegedly included\n\nhis immediate supervisor, Steve Cannon, the division manager,\n\nGeorge Carney, and Carney's secretary, Rita McAvoy.  \n\n          Lewis  stated  in  his  deposition  below that  the\n\nprimary  form of  harassment  was constant  daily \"watching,\"\n\n\"staring,\"  or \"gawking\" at him while he went about his work.\n\n                             -2-\n\nThe named employees  and others  allegedly would  stand as  a\n\ngroup, or individually,  and stare at him while  he performed\n\nhis tasks.   This \"watching,\" Lewis  claimed, occurred almost\n\ndaily, most  frequently from  9:00  A.M. to  11:00 A.M.,  and\n\nwhile he  punched in  and punched  out for  the  day.   Lewis\n\nacknowledged, however,  that his work station  during most of\n\nthis period was on the same floor as the others' offices, and\n\nin a direct line  of vision through their office  windows, or\n\nglass partitions.\n\n          In June, 1985, Lewis complained about the \"gawking\"\n\nto one of  the attorneys in the class action  case, Amos Hugh\n\nScott.  Scott,  in turn reported the  complaint to Gillette's\n\nin-house  counsel, George  Walker.   According to  Lewis, the\n\nonly response to  the complaint came from  Cannon, who warned\n\nLewis  \"whatever happens  in  Gillette you  leave it  there.\"\n\nLewis also complained directly to Walker, and to two Gillette\n\npersonnel  managers in 1986  and 1987.   An  internal company\n\nreport, written  by Carney  in May,  1987  shows that  Carney\n\nwarned  Lewis   that  his  persistence  in  these  \"unfounded\n\nallegations\" constituted \"a continued  display of an attitude\n\nagainst the  best interests  of the  company, and  failure to\n\ncooperate  with management\"  which  could lead  to a  \"final\"\n\nwarning.  \n\n          In support  of its  motion for summary  judgment on\n\nthe  harassment  claim,  Gillette  produced  affidavits  from\n\n                             -3-\n\nCarney, Cannon and McAvoy.  Cannon  denied knowing that Lewis\n\nhad testified at an arbitration hearing until after Lewis was\n\nfired.  McAvoy and Carney knew  that Lewis had testified at a\n\nhearing,  but averred that they  did not know  the subject of\n\nLewis' testimony. \n\n          The   evidence   relating  to   Lewis's  employment\n\ndischarge  focused on  events  that occurred  on November  3,\n\n1987, when Lewis reported  to work late.  The  parties agreed\n\nthat unbeknownst  to  Lewis, another  worker  had  mistakenly\n\npunched Lewis's time card.   Cannon, noticing that  Lewis was\n\nnot  at his work station, placed Lewis's punched time card on\n\nCarney's desk.  When Lewis arrived, he retrieved the card and\n\npunched  in.   Cannon  then  confronted Lewis  with  the mis-\n\npunched card.   \n\n          The  parties dispute  what happened  next.   As the\n\ndetails  are not necessary to our decision, we note only that\n\nLewis's  claim is  that  he  was  led  to  believe  that  his\n\nemployment  was  terminated  on the  spot,  and  after  a few\n\npreliminaries he  left the building as instructed. Gillette's\n\nversion, based on Carney's report, is that Lewis responded to\n\nCannon in  a belligerent and  threatening manner, and  made a\n\npersonal telephone  call despite an order  and company policy\n\nto the contrary.  Gillette alleges that Lewis' employment was\n\nterminated   for   insubordination   displayed  during   this\n\nconfrontation.  \n\n                             -4-\n\n          On  review  of  a  grant  of  summary  judgment  we\n\napproach the record de novo drawing all reasonable inferences\n\nin favor of the non-moving party.   LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins.\n                                                             \n\nCo.,  6 F.3d  836,  840 (1st  Cir.  1993), cert.  denied,  62\n                                                        \n\nU.S.L.W. 3657 (U.S. 1994); Mesnick  v. General Elec. Co., 950\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 816, 820 (1st Cir. 1991), cert.  denied, 112 S. Ct. 2965\n                                            \n\n(1992).  Summary judgment is appropriate only when the moving\n\nparty shows there  is \"no  genuine issue as  to any  material\n\nfact  and [he] is  entitled to judgment as  a matter of law.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  \n\n          When the  non-moving  party  bears  the  burden  of\n\npersuasion at  trial, however,  to avoid summary  judgment he\n\nmust make a \"showing sufficient to establish the existence of\n\n[the] element[s] essential to [his]  case.\"  Celotex Corp. v.\n                                                          \n\nCatrett, 477  U.S. 317, 322-23  (1986).  The  nonmoving party\n       \n\n\"may  not  rest  upon  mere  allegation  or  denials  of  his\n\npleading.\"   LeBlanc,  6 F.3d  at  841 (quoting  Anderson  v.\n                                                         \n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477  U.S. 242, 256 (1986)).   Rather, to\n                   \n\nestablish  a  trial-worthy  issue,   there  must  be   enough\n\ncompetent evidence \"to enable a finding favorable to the non-\n\nmoving party.\"  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 841 (citations omitted). \n                       \n\n          The  district court  granted  summary  judgment  to\n\nGillette on the retaliatory  discharge claim because it found\n\nthat  Lewis's proof on the elements  of causation and pretext\n\nwere insufficient  to make out a  claim for the jury.   As to\n\n                             -5-\n\nthe harassment claim, the  court concluded that the \"gawking\"\n\nof  which  Lewis  complained  was  not sufficiently  \"severe\"\n\nconduct  to  constitute   actionable  harassment  within  the\n\nmeaning of Meritor Savs. Bank v. Vinson FSB, 477 U.S. 57, 64-\n                                           \n\n67 (1986).  \n\n            While  this  case  was  pending  on  appeal,  the\n\nSupreme  Court decided Harris v.  Forklift Sys., Inc., 114 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 367  (1993).   There  the  Court explained  that  Meritor\n                                                             \n\n\"takes a  middle path  between making actionable  any conduct\n\nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a\n\ntangible psychological injury.\"   Harris, 114 S. Ct.  at 370.\n                                        \n\nWe need  not assess the  impact of this  reformulated Meritor\n                                                             \n\nstandard,  however,  because  we  conclude  that  plaintiff's\n\nevidence was otherwise insufficient  to make out the elements\n\nof a prima  facie case of  retaliation.  See Garside  v. Osco\n                                                             \n\nDrug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1990) (in appraising\n          \n\nsummary  judgments, a court of  appeals is not  wedded to the\n\ndistrict   court's   reasoning,  but   may   affirm  on   any\n\nindependently sufficient ground).      \n\n          To succeed  on claims of retaliatory  discharge and\n\nretaliatory harassment, a plaintiff  must establish the basic\n\nfact that he  was subjected to  an adverse employment  action\n\nbecause of his protected activity.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B,  \n       \n\n4(4)  (making it  unlawful  for an  employer to  discriminate\n\nbecause the employee opposed practices forbidden by the law);\n\n                             -6-\n\nCollege-Town, Div. of  Interco, Inc. v.

At  a minimum, there must be  competent evidence\n\nthat  the  alleged   retaliators  knew  of   the  plaintiff's\n\nprotected  activity and  that a  retaliatory motive  played a\n\npart in  the adverse employment  actions alleged.

Lewis testified to various and widely divergent estimates\nof the date when the alleged harassment began.  While he said\nat one point, \"it started the day  before I left . . . to  go\nto the arbitration hearing,\" Lewis Dep. at 114, ll. 18-25, he\nalso  stated at  another point that  he gave  his arbitration\ntestimony  in June,  1984, but  the alleged gawking  began in\nJune, 1985.   Lewis Dep. at 83-25 to  84-1; 88, ll. 1-7.  See\n                                                             \nalso  Lewis Dep. at  88-14 (\"it  was the  month after  I come\n    \nback\");  Lewis Dep. at 88, ll. 16-19 (\"I can't remember [when\nit  started]\");  Lewis  Dep.  at  114,  ll.9-13  (it  started\n\"sometime after\"  the testimony);  Lewis Dep. Exh.  3, (sworn\n\n                             -7-\n\nrepeatedly expressed his  personal belief that the  \"gawking\"\n\nwas  motivated  by  a  retaliatory  animus,  he  produced  no\n\nevidence  to support  his  surmise.2   At  his deposition  he\n\ncandidly  admitted that he knew of no facts which showed that\n\nthe  alleged   harassers  even   knew  the  subject   of  his\n\narbitration hearing  testimony, nor that they  had any reason\n\nto  be concerned about it.3  That Lewis' complaints about the\n\ngawking  were conveyed to  Cannon and  Carney may  support an\n\ninference  that  they  thereby  learned  of  Lewis's  earlier\n\nprotected  activity, but  that  inference does  not logically\n\nextend  backwards to  prove that  the antecedent  gawking was\n\nundertaken for a retaliatory purpose.\n\n          For the same reason, we affirm the dismissal of the\n\nretaliatory  discharge claim.   Lewis  offered no  additional\n\nfacts  to show a causal link  between his protected testimony\n\nand his discharge from employment, more than two years later.\n\nHis claim to  a connection  was based solely  on the  alleged\n\n                    \n\ncharge    2,  dating  testimony to  1985  and gawking  \"since\nthen\");  Lewis Dep.  at 311-7  (dating gawking  from \"shortly\nbefore\" June, 1985). \n\n2.  Lewis   apparently   expressed   his    personal   belief\nfrequently, in  the complaints  he made  to the  class action\nattorney and others, as well as at his deposition. Lewis Dep.\nat  100-114, 223-40, 287-91.   When pressed for  the basis of\nhis belief,  however, he could  only explain, \"it's  the only\nreason  I could come up  with I guess .  . . because I didn't\nhave these problems until  I come back [from  the arbitration\nhearing]\".  Lewis Dep. at 249, ll. 3-4, 7-8.\n\n3.

Cannon's\n\nambiguous  response  to   Lewis'  1985  complaint,  \"whatever\n\nhappens  in  Gillette you  leave  it there,\"  does  not alone\n\nprovide  a  sufficiently strong  inference  of  a retaliatory\n\nmindset to make out a claim of wrongful discharge more than a\n\nyear later.  Even adding whatever favorable inferences may be\n\ngleaned from  Carney's later  warning  about \"persistence  in\n\nunfounded allegations,\" the sum of these two ambiguities does\n\nnot provide  sufficient evidence  to establish  the requisite\n\ncausal  connection.  While  circumstantial evidence sometimes\n\nmay  be  \"sufficient  to leap  the  summary  judgment  . .  .\n\nhurdle,\"  there  must be  something  more  than  a  few  weak\n\ninferences  to  create reasonable  proof  of  a link  between\n\nevents so widely  separated in  time.

Those involved allegedly included his immediate supervisor, Steve Cannon, the division manager, George Carney, and Carney's secretary, Rita McAvoy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis stated in his deposition below that the primary form of harassment was constant daily \"watching,\" \"staring,\" or \"gawking\" at him while he went about his work.  The named employees and others allegedly would stand as a group, or individually, and stare at him while he performed his tasks.  This \"watching,\" Lewis claimed, occurred almost daily, most frequently from 9:00 A.M. to 11:00 A.M., and while he punched in and punched out for the day.  Lewis acknowledged, however, that his work station during most of this period was on the same floor as the others' offices, and in a direct line of vision through their office windows, or glass partitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June, 1985, Lewis complained about the \"gawking\" to one of the attorneys in the class action case, Amos Hugh Scott.  Scott, in turn reported the complaint to Gillette's in-house counsel, George Walker.  According to Lewis, the only response to the complaint came from Cannon, who warned Lewis \"whatever happens in Gillette you leave it there.\"   Lewis also complained directly to Walker, and to two Gillette personnel managers in 1986 and 1987.  An internal company report, written by Carney in May, 1987 shows that Carney warned Lewis that his persistence in these \"unfounded allegations\" constituted \"a continued display of an attitude against the best interests of the company, and failure to cooperate with management\" which could lead to a \"final\" warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its motion for summary judgment on the harassment claim, Gillette produced affidavits from Carney, Cannon and McAvoy.  Cannon denied knowing that Lewis had testified at an arbitration hearing until after Lewis was fired.  McAvoy and Carney knew that Lewis had testified at a hearing, but averred that they did not know the subject of Lewis' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence relating to Lewis's employment discharge focused on events that occurred on November 3, 1987, when Lewis reported to work late.  The parties agreed that unbeknownst to Lewis, another worker had mistakenly punched Lewis's time card.  Cannon, noticing that Lewis was not at his work station, placed Lewis's punched time card on Carney's desk.  When Lewis arrived, he retrieved the card and punched in.  Cannon then confronted Lewis with the mis-punched card.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute what happened next.  As the details are not necessary to our decision, we note only that Lewis's claim is that he was led to believe that his employment was terminated on the spot, and after a few preliminaries he left the building as instructed.  Gillette's version, based on Carney's report, is that Lewis responded to Cannon in a belligerent and threatening manner, and made a personal telephone call despite an order and company policy to the contrary.  Gillette alleges that Lewis' employment was terminated for insubordination displayed during this confrontation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On review of a grant of summary judgment we approach the record de novo drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.

Vinson FSB, 477 U.S. 57, 64-67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404-06, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court decided Harris v.

There the Court explained that Meritor \"takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury.\"  Harris, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 370.   We need not assess the impact of this reformulated Meritor standard, however, because we conclude that plaintiff's evidence was otherwise insufficient to make out the elements of a prima facie case of retaliation.  See Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48-49 (1st Cir.1990) (in appraising summary judgments, a court of appeals is not wedded to the district court's reasoning, but may affirm on any independently sufficient ground).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on claims of retaliatory discharge and retaliatory harassment, a plaintiff must establish the basic fact that he was subjected to an adverse employment action because of his protected activity.  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 151B, Sec. 4(4) (making it unlawful for an employer to discriminate because the employee opposed practices forbidden by the law);  College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. v. Massachusetts Comm'n Against Discrimination, 400 Mass. 156, 167, 508 N.E.2d 587, 594 (1987).  At a minimum, there must be competent evidence that the alleged retaliators knew of the plaintiff's protected activity and that a retaliatory motive played a part in the adverse employment actions alleged.  Hazel v. U.S. Postmaster Gen., 7 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993) (stating elements under federal discrimination laws);  Petitti v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 909 F.2d 28, 33 (1st Cir.1990) (same);  Morgan v. Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., 901 F.2d 186, 194 (1st Cir.1990) (same);  see also College-Town, 508 N.E.2d at 591, 594 (though not bound by federal law, Massachusetts courts usually look to interpretations of the analogous federal statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only evidence Lewis produced below which might be characterized as probative of a causal connection between his protected activity and the alleged group harassment was one of his own several inconsistent deposition statements about the temporal sequence of the events.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Although Lewis repeatedly expressed his personal belief that the \"gawking\" was motivated by a retaliatory animus, he produced no evidence to support his surmise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  At his deposition he candidly admitted that he knew of no facts which showed that the alleged harassers even knew the subject of his arbitration hearing testimony, nor that they had any reason to be concerned about it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  That Lewis' complaints about the gawking were conveyed to Cannon and Carney may support an inference that they thereby learned of Lewis's earlier protected activity, but that inference does not logically extend backwards to prove that the antecedent gawking was undertaken for a retaliatory purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reason, we affirm the dismissal of the retaliatory discharge claim.  Lewis offered no additional facts to show a causal link between his protected testimony and his discharge from employment, more than two years later.  His claim to a connection was based solely on the alleged campaign of gawking and Cannon's response to his first complaint about it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  As we have said, however, there was insufficient evidence to connect the gawking itself to Lewis's protected testimony, so it does not provide the needed bridge for the retaliatory discharge claim.  Cannon's ambiguous response to Lewis' 1985 complaint, \"whatever happens in Gillette you leave it there,\" does not alone provide a sufficiently strong inference of a retaliatory mindset to make out a claim of wrongful discharge more than a year later.  Even adding whatever favorable inferences may be gleaned from Carney's later warning about \"persistence in unfounded allegations,\" the sum of these two ambiguities does not provide sufficient evidence to establish the requisite causal connection.  While circumstantial evidence sometimes may be \"sufficient to leap the summary judgment ... hurdle,\" there must be something more than a few weak inferences to create reasonable proof of a link between events so widely separated in time.  Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 828;  see also Oliver v. Digital Equip.  Corp., 846 F.2d 103, 110-11 (1st Cir.1988) (while a showing of employment discharge \"soon after\" protected activity may be strongly suggestive of a causal connection, a longer period of time does not lend itself to such an inference).  Since we find that Lewis failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, we need not consider the additional ground, insufficient evidence of pretext, relied upon below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lewis testified to various and widely divergent estimates of the date when the alleged harassment began.

Lewis alleges that defendant Gillette, Co., unlawfully harassed him over a several year period, and ultimately discharged him from employment, because he testified against the company at a race discrimination arbitration hearing.  His complaint also asserts race discrimination and breach of contract claims under Massachusetts and federal law.  Lewis abandoned the race discrimination claim below.

Sometime in 1984 or 1985, he testified on behalf of a co-worker at an arbitration hearing held pursuant to a class action settlement of race discrimination claims by black employees against Gillette.  He claims that thereafter a group campaign of retaliatory harassment was launched against him by white employees at the plant.

Lewis offered no additional facts to show a causal link between his protected testimony and his discharge from employment, more than two years later.  His claim to a connection was based solely on the alleged campaign of gawking and Cannon's response to his first complaint about it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  As we have said, however, there was insufficient evidence to connect the gawking itself to Lewis's protected testimony, so it does not provide the needed bridge for the retaliatory discharge claim.  Cannon's ambiguous response to Lewis' 1985 complaint, \"whatever happens in Gillette you leave it there,\" does not alone provide a sufficiently strong inference of a retaliatory mindset to make out a claim of wrongful discharge more than a year later.  Even adding whatever favorable inferences may be gleaned from Carney's later warning about \"persistence in unfounded allegations,\" the sum of these two ambiguities does not provide sufficient evidence to establish the requisite causal connection.  While circumstantial evidence sometimes may be \"sufficient to leap the summary judgment ... hurdle,\" there must be something more than a few weak inferences to create reasonable proof of a link between events so widely separated in time.

Since we find that Lewis failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, we need not consider the additional ground, insufficient evidence of pretext, relied upon below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lewis testified to various and widely divergent estimates of the date when the alleged harassment began.
