Bay Loan and  East West counterclaimed for breach of\n\ncontract and  bad faith  refusal to  pay  and sought  payment\n\nunder the policies.   After a bench trial  the district court\n\n(Boyle, C.J.) found that defendants were entitled to coverage\n\nunder  the   insurance  policies,  and   granted  declaratory\n\njudgment in their  favor.  The  court found that  defendants'\n\ncounterclaims for damages were  premature and dismissed  them\n\nwithout prejudice.  Both parties appealed, and in March 1992,\n\nwe  remanded the case for  a \"total new  trial on the merits\"\n\nbecause  Judge Boyle had  improperly allocated the  burden of\n\nproof on the issue of apparent authority.  See American Title\n                                                             \n\nIns. v.

We  affirm  the  district court's  ruling  on\n         \n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nliability  and its  dismissal with  prejudice  of Bay  Loan's\n                                  \n\nclaim under  one of the  insurance policies, but  reverse its\n\ndismissal without  prejudice  of Bay  Loan's  claims  arising\n                 \n\nunder the remaining policies.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          We describe only those facts pertinent to the legal\n\nissues presented on these appeals.   In the late 1980s, Peter\n\nBrandon, one  of the  principals of  Dean Street  Development\n\nCompany (\"Dean Street\"),  offered investors a deal  for motel\n\ncondominium units.   \"Buyers  were promised  a deal  where no\n\nmoney  down  was  required; guaranteed  they  could  not lose\n\nmoney; and  assured that  they would  receive a  five percent\n\nreturn   on  the  initial  purchase  price  in  five  years.\"\n\nAmerican  Title I, 959 F.2d  at 346.   The deal collapsed and\n                 \n\nBrandon and his  associates were convicted of  defrauding Bay\n\nLoan  out of millions of dollars by fraudulently representing\n\nthe existence of down payments  required by Bay Loan from the\n\ninvestors on whose behalf the loans were made.1\n\n          Dean Street bought operating motels in Rhode Island\n\nand  used purchase money mortgages to finance each purchase.2\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  convictions were, in large part, affirmed on appeal.\nSee United States  v. Brandon, Nos.  1447, 1465-71 (1st  Cir.\n                             \nJan. 31, 1994).\n\n2.  Although Dean  Street purchased  seven motels, only  four\nare at issue in this  proceeding:  The Charlestown Motor Inn,\nThe Hillside Motel, The Sand Castle Motel,  and The Sandpiper\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nIt would then  \"condominiumize\" each motel and  market titles\n\nto the individual units.   Dean Street arranged financing for\n\nthe  buyers  through East  West  and  Bay  Loan.   East  West\n\noriginated the  loans and then  sold them to Bay  Loan, which\n\nactually advanced the funds.\n\n          Closings on  the individual units were conducted at\n\nthe  law offices of  George Marderosian in  Providence, Rhode\n\nIsland.  Although Marderosian's original involvement in these\n\ntransactions  was as Dean Street's lawyer, he eventually came\n\nto represent  both  Dean  Street  and  the  buyers  in  these\n\ntransactions.     All  of   the  buyers  consented   to  this\n\narrangement.  Marderosian  also served as  \"settlement agent\"\n\nor \"closing attorney\"  at the closings and  was an authorized\n\nagent of American Title.   \n\n          Because  Dean  Street  could   not  obtain  partial\n\nreleases on  its purchase money  mortgages, it had to  sell a\n\nnumber of condominium  units before enough funds  were raised\n\nto discharge the  prior mortgages.   Once  enough units  were\n\nsold, closings were held on  each unit, and East West bundled\n\nthe loans and sent them  as a package to Bay Loan.  Among the\n\ndocuments  forwarded to Bay  Loan were the  closing documents\n\nalong  with mortgages  and title  insurance  policies on  the\n\nindividual condominium units.\n\n                    \n\nMotel.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          All  of  this  was done  before  Bay  Loan formally\n\npurchased  the  loans from  East  West.   Although  Bay  Loan\n\nretained  the right  to reject any  loan, it  never exercised\n\nthis  right.  When a  loan was approved,  Bay Loan would wire\n\nthe proceeds to East West, and East West would distribute the\n\nfunds to Marderosian's  trust account.  Even though the prior\n\nmortgages had  not  yet been  paid off,  the title  insurance\n\npolicies issued by Marderosian were ostensibly \"clean.\"  That\n\nwas, they  indicated that the  units were not subject  to any\n\nprior defects, liens or encumbrances.\n\n          The parties  orally agreed  that Marderosian  would\n\nuse  the loan  proceeds to discharge  the prior  mortgages so\n\nthat Bay  Loan's mortgage  would be primary.   Bay  Loan soon\n\ndiscovered   that  the   prior  mortgages   were  not   being\n\ndischarged.     This   was  because   Marderosian  had   been\n\n\"diverting\" the loan proceeds to Dean Street instead of using\n\nthem to discharge prior mortgages.  American Title II, 817 F.\n                                                     \n\nSupp. at 255.  Dean  Street, or more precisely, Peter Brandon\n\nconverted the funds  for personal use.  The  prior mortgagees\n\nforeclosed, thereby extinguishing Bay Loan's mortgages.3\n\n                    \n\n3.  Bay  Loan lost its  security interest in  all twenty-four\nunits at the Sand Castle  Motel, two of the thirty-nine units\nat the  Sandpiper Motel,  and seventeen  of the  thirty-three\nunits  at the Charlestown Motor  Inn.  Bay  Loan paid off the\nprior mortgage at the Hillside Motel in order to preserve its\nsecurity interest in all thirty-seven units at that motel.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          Consequently, Bay Loan filed a notice of claim with\n\nAmerican  Title under  the  title  insurance  policies.    In\n\nresponse American Title filed an action in the United  States\n\nDistrict  Court  for  the District  of  Rhode  Island seeking\n\ndeclaratory  judgment relieving  it from liability  under the\n\npolicies.   Bay Loan and  East West counterclaimed for breach\n\nof contract  and bad  faith refusal  to pay.   In an  opinion\n\ndated April  10, 1991, Judge  Boyle held that  American Title\n\nwas  liable under the title insurance policies, but dismissed\n\ndefendants' counterclaims as premature.  Both sides appealed.\n\n          We remanded the case for a new trial because  Judge\n\nBoyle had erroneously burdened American Title with disproving\n\nMarderosian's  apparent  authority  to  issue  \"clean\"  title\n\ninsurance policies  on its behalf.   We held that  the burden\n\nwas on the defendants to prove the existence of Marderosian's\n\napparent authority.   After  the second  trial, Judge  Torres\n\nfound that Bay  Loan's claim  with respect  to the  insurance\n\npolicy relating to  the unit owned by Norma  Kirschner in The\n\nCharlestown  Motor   Inn  (the  \"Kirschner  unit\"),  was  not\n\npremature.  The court found that Bay Loan failed to prove its\n\ndamages on that claim and dismissed the claim with prejudice.\n\nIt, however, dismissed  without prejudice  Bay Loan's  claims\n                               \n\nunder the remaining policies.  These appeals ensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          As  a  preliminary matter,  we disagree  with Judge\n\nTorres' conclusion that  the case was remanded  for something\n\nshort of  a \"total new  trial on the  merits.\"  See  American\n                                                             \n\nTitle II, 817  F. Supp. at 256-58.   Therefore, Judge Torres'\n        \n\n\"alternative  findings,\"  and   not  Judge  Boyle's   earlier\n\nfindings are currently before this court for review.\n\n          We review the district court's factual findings for\n\nclear  error.

Moreover, it  is  undisputed that\n\nAmerican Title never  informed Bay Loan that  Marderosian was\n\nnot empowered  to issue clean  title policies in the  face of\n\nprior undischarged  liens unless  the funds  required to  pay\n\nthem were  in the  agent's possession and  the lender  was an\n\ninstitution.\n\n          American  Title  argues  that,  because there  were\n\nsubstantial  deviations from  accepted business  practices in\n\nthe  Dean   Street  transactions,  Bay  Loan's   reliance  on\n\nMarderosian's   apparent  authority   was  unreasonable   and\n\ntherefore his acts should not  be imputed to American  Title.\n\nSee, e.g., Sheldon v.

The same arguments were presented\n\nto the district court which found the following:\n\n               Here, there was  no reason for  East\n          West  or Bay Loan  to believe  that there\n          was anything  improper about  issuing the\n          policies  before  prior   mortgages  were\n          discharged.  It was common practice among\n          title  attorneys to  use the  proceeds of\n          purchase  money  mortgages  to  discharge\n          prior mortgages after  closing.  Although\n          it was  less  common for  an attorney  to\n          issue   a  title   policy  before   prior\n          mortgages were discharged,  that practice\n          was  acceptable  when  the  attorney  had\n          adequate   assurances   that   the  funds\n          required to  pay such  mortgage would  be\n          forthcoming  and   that  the   mortgagees\n          would, in fact, execute discharges.\n               In this case, East West and Bay Loan\n          had no  cause to be  concerned about  the\n          availability  of funds  necessary to  pay\n          prior mortgages  because Bay  Loan itself\n          was   the   source    of   those   funds.\n          Furthermore,   unless   the   funds  were\n          advanced, Bay Loan would not have been at\n          risk  because   it  would  have   had  no\n          mortgages.   Finally, East  West and  Bay\n          Loan had no reason to doubt Marderosian's\n          assurances  that  the proceeds  of  their\n          loans would  be used  to discharge  prior\n          mortgages.      Indeed,   it   would   be\n          unreasonable to conclude  that they would\n          have made  such loans  if they  suspected\n          otherwise.\n               In short,  under the  circumstances,\n          it was perfectly reasonable for East West\n          and Bay Loan to believe that  Marderosian\n          was  authorized  to issue  \"clean\"  title\n          policies.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nAmerican Title II, 817 F. Supp. at 259.  We have conducted an\n                 \n\nexhaustive review  of the record  and can find  no compelling\n\nevidence to  the contrary.  Bay Loan  plausibly explained why\n\neach \"departure\" was not sufficient  to raise any eyebrows at\n\nthe time it occurred.  The district court credited Bay Loan's\n\nexplanations.\n\n          With the  benefit of  hindsight American  Title has\n\nstrung together  distinct aspects  of these  transactions and\n\nargues  that  Bay  Loan's  belief in  Marderosian's  apparent\n\nauthority was  clearly unreasonable.   The  question we  must\n\nask, however, is whether Bay Loan's reliance on Marderosian's\n\napparent  authority  to  issue  \"clean\"  title  policies  was\n\nreasonable in  light of what Bay Loan knew  at the time.  The\n\ndistrict court found that it was, and we affirm.\n\nB.  The Policy Exclusion\n                        \n\n          As its second rationale for  relief, American Title\n\nargues that Bay Loan is  not entitled to recovery because the\n\ntitle policies  exclude coverage  for encumbrances  \"created,\n\nsuffered,  assumed or  agreed to  by  the insured  claimant.\"\n\nWhere an  insurance company  seeks to  deny coverage  under a\n\npolicy exclusion,  it carries the burden of  proving that the\n\nexclusion applies.

The court added that,\n\n          Marderosian  had  apparent  authority  to\n          issue \"clean\" title policies on behalf of\n          American Title.  In doing so, he acted as\n          American  Title's agent,  not Bay  Loan's\n          agent.  Moreover, East  West and Bay Loan\n          justifiably   relied   on   Marderosian's\n          representations  that  he would  use  the\n          loan   proceeds   to    discharge   prior\n          mortgages  and were  unaware that  he did\n          otherwise.    Therefore  the  defects  in\n          title against  which the  policies insure\n          were   neither   created,   suffered  nor\n          assumed by East West or Bay Loan.\n\nAmerican Title II,  817 F. Supp. at  263.  We agree  with the\n                 \n\ndistrict court that Bay Loan did not act  in the manner which\n\nwould  bar  recovery under  the  policy  exclusion.    It  is\n\nuncontroverted that Bay Loan relied on Marderosian to pay off\n\nthe prior mortgage and believed that it would be  paid off in\n\nthe  normal course.   It  is  also undisputed  that Bay  Loan\n\nintended that the proceeds from its  loans be used to pay off\n\nthe  prior mortgages,  and  that its  mortgages  be the  only\n\nencumbrances on the  properties.  The continued  existence of\n\nthe prior mortgages was unintended by Bay Loan.\n\n          On appeal American Title maintains that Bay Loan is\n\nvicariously liable for  the acts of Marderosian as its agent.\n\nSee Baker  v. ICA  Mortgage Corp., 588  A.2d 616  (R.I. 1991)\n                                 \n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n(mortgagee's liability  for embezzlement by  closing attorney\n\nrests upon proof of agency).

Further, the  principal  must have  the  right to\n\ncontrol  the  work of  the  agent,  and  the agent  must  act\n\nprimarily for  the benefit  of the  principal.   Id.  (citing\n                                                    \n\ncases).\n\n          American  Title offered  testimony that,  generally\n\nspeaking, an attorney who serves as the \"settlement agent\" or\n\n\"closing agent\" at a closing is an agent of the lender and is\n\nresponsible  for disbursing  loan  proceeds  on the  lender's\n\nbehalf.  In  addition, Marderosian designated himself  on the\n\nHUD  1  form as  the  \"settlement  agent.\"   There  was  also\n\ntestimony from representatives of East West and Bay Loan that\n\ncould have  supported a finding that Marderosian acted as Bay\n\nLoan's agent at the closings.\n\n          On the other hand, our review of the record reveals\n\nthat there  was no express  agreement in this  regard between\n\nBay Loan  and Marderosian.    Furthermore, Bay  Loan did  not\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nprovide  any  instructions  to  or  exert  any  control  over\n\nMarderosian, and Bay Loan did  not participate in the payment\n\nof Marderosian as closing attorney.  In addition, the  record\n\nis unclear as to how  Marderosian became the closing agent in\n\nthe  first place.  The district  court found that Marderosian\n\nwas not Bay  Loan's agent.  \"Where there  are two permissible\n\nviews of the  evidence, the factfinder's choice  between them\n\ncan not be clearly erroneous.\" American Title I, 959 F.2d 346\n                                               \n\n(quoting  Cumpiano v.

Accordingly,  we  affirm  the\n\ndistrict  court's finding that the continued existence of the\n\nprior mortgages was not \"created, suffered, assumed or agreed\n\nto\" by Bay Loan within the meaning of the policy.\n\nC.  Damages\n           \n\n          The title policies insure Bay Loan \"against loss or\n\ndamage  . . . sustained or  incurred by the insured by reason\n\nof .  . . [t]he invalidity or unenforceability of the lien of\n\nthe insured  mortgage . . . [or t]he  priority of any lien or\n\nencumbrance over the lien of the insured mortgage.\"  American\n\nTitle's liability is limited to the lesser of: (1) Bay Loan's\n\nactual  loss;  (2)  the  amount  of  insurance;  or  (3)  the\n\nindebtedness  secured by the insured mortgage  at the time of\n\nthe loss.  Only  the first of these remained unknown prior to\n\ntrial.   Both  parties and  the  district court  acknowledged\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nthat, because  Bay Loan's  mortgages were  rendered worthless\n\nwhen  the prior mortgagee  foreclosed, its actual  loss under\n\neach  policy  would   be  the  lesser   of  (1)  the   amount\n\nuncollectible from the  defaulting borrower, or (2)  the fair\n\nmarket  value of  the unit  at the  time the  prior mortgagee\n\nforeclosed.5\n\n          The  district court  dismissed, without  prejudice,\n\nBay  Loan's policy  claims  in connection  with  all but  the\n\nKirschner unit on the  ground that its claims  were premature\n\nunder Falmouth  Nat. Bank v.  Ticor Title Ins. Co.,  920 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1058 (1st Cir. 1990).   On appeal, American Title argues that\n\nthe district  court should  have  reached the  merits of  Bay\n\nLoan's damage claims with respect to all eighty units.\n\n          In Falmouth we held that a bank's claim for damages\n                     \n\nunder  a mortgagee's  title  insurance  policy was  premature\n\nbecause  the amount of  the loss was  not \"definitely fixed.\"\n\nThe  relevant provision,  which also  appears  in Bay  Loan's\n\ntitle  policies,   provides:    \"When   liability  has   been\n\ndefinitely  fixed in accordance  with the conditions  of this\n                 \n\npolicy, the  loss or damage  shall be payable within  30 days\n\nthereafter.\" (emphasis added).  In fact, there is no material\n\ndifference  between  Bay  Loan's   policies  and  the  policy\n\nconstrued in Falmouth.\n                     \n\n                    \n\n5.  A  more  detailed  explanation   of  the  \"actual   loss\"\ncalculation can  be found  in the  district court's  opinion.\nSee American Title II, 817 F. Supp. at 260-61.\n                     \n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\n          In Falmouth, the insured  brought an action against\n                     \n\nits  title  insurer  for  failure  to  pay  a  loss  under  a\n\nmortgagee's  title insurance policy  after liability had been\n\ndetermined against  the insurer by  the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (SJC)  in a related action.   The SJC remanded\n\nthe case  for further  proceedings.6   The insurance  company\n\nmoved  to dismiss  the action  for failure  to state  a claim\n\narguing that the bank's \"actual loss\" could not be determined\n\nuntil the state court determined the value of the property on\n\nremand.   The bank argued that liability was definitely fixed\n\nby  the SJC's  ruling,  and that  the  insurance company  was\n\nliable  for the principal and accrued interest outstanding on\n\nthe buyer's  mortgage note.   The district court  agreed with\n\nthe insurance company, and we affirmed.\n\n          In affirming the dismissal,  we construed the terms\n\nof the title insurance policy,  focusing on the issue of when\n\na loss is \"definitely fixed\" and payable to the  insured.  We\n\ndistinguished owner's title insurance policies, in which loss\n\nis measured by the decrease in market value caused by a title\n\ndefect, and mortgagee's title policies in which a bank's loss\n\nequals  the lesser  of the  decrease in  market value  of the\n\n                    \n\n6.  In  that action,  as a  result of  the SJC's  ruling, the\nbuyer  of the mortgaged property was  required to reconvey it\nto the seller.  The seller was required to remit the purchase\nprice with appropriate adjustments (e.g., passage of time and\n                                        \nimprovements on  the land).   The  terms of  the reconveyance\nwere the subjects of the remand.\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nbank's security caused by the title defect or the amount that\n\nis unrecoverable on the borrower's defaulted notes.\n\n          With respect to the mortgagee's policies at issue\n\nwe held that \"a mortgagee-insured's loss cannot be determined\n\nunless  the note  is  not  repaid and  the  security for  the\n\nmortgage  proves inadequate. . . .   Such is the case because\n\nit is only after the insurer or the insured sues on  the note\n\nand the  debtor fails  to pay,  that the  actual loss  can be\n\ndetermined.\"  Falmouth, 920 F.2d at 1063 (citations omitted).\n                      \n\nThe bank  took  the  position  that  the  insurer  should  be\n\nrequired  to pay the outstanding principal, interest and late\n\npayments due on the debt, and subrogate to the bank's rights.\n\nWe rejected this  argument because the insurance  policy gave\n\nthe insurer the option to  either pay the bank's actual loss,\n\nor  purchase the  indebtedness and  subrogate  to the  bank's\n\nrights against the  mortgagors.  We held that  to require the\n\ninsurance  company to pay the indebtedness before the \"actual\n\nloss\" is ascertained, \"would have the  effect of amending the\n\npolicy by making subrogation mandatory rather than optional.\"\n\nFalmouth, 920 F.2d at 1063.\n        \n\n          We turn our  attention to the case at hand.  At the\n\ncommencement of the second trial,  Bay Loan took the position\n\nthat  because  it   had  commenced  suits  against   all  the\n\ndefaulting  borrowers, it had  satisfied the  requirements of\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nFalmouth at  least  with  respect  to  some  of  the  units.7\n        \n\nAmerican Title was of  the opinion that Bay Loan would not be\n\nable to prove the fair  market value of the individual units,\n\nbutthat evenifit could,itsclaims wereprematureunder Falmouth.\n                                                            \n\n          When the  district court  asked Bay  Loan what  the\n\ncourt  should do  if  some but  not  all of  the claims  were\n\npremature under Falmouth, Bay Loan responded as follows:\n                        \n\n          I think  that the  appropriate relief  in\n          those  circumstances if  the Court  rules\n          that Falmouth does apply in  part to this\n                       \n          case,  would  be  for the  Court  to make\n          appropriate   findings  and   conclusions\n          which  would  be  necessary  as to  those\n          borrowers for whom we have fulfilled  the\n          requirements  of  Falmouth.     The  same\n                                    \n          findings and conclusions would ultimately\n          apply presumedly to the others.\n\nBay Loan added:\n\n          About the measure  of the recovery .  . .\n          we contend that  the measure of  recovery\n          is   the  fair   market   value  of   the\n          condominiums at  the time they  were lost\n          at the foreclosure of senior liens and we\n          are  prepared to  prove  what that  value\n          was.   If the Court finds that some other\n          measure would be  more appropriate or  if\n          the  Court   should  disagree   with  our\n          valuation and decide they were worth some\n          different amount,  you know,  appropriate\n          findings and conclusions could be made so\n          that as  litigation with  other borrowers\n          is resolved,  either by  judgments or  by\n          bankruptcies   or   however    they   get\n          resolved,  both  Bay  Loan  and  American\n          Title would know what  the other's rights\n\n                    \n\n7.  The parties did not stake out positions on Falmouth prior\n                                                       \nto the first  trial because the decision in  Falmouth was not\n                                                     \nhanded down until the day before that trial commenced.\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\n          are.   And  I think  that  would be  easy\n          enough to do.\n\nAs the trial progressed, it  became clear that Bay Loan would\n\nnot be able to prove the fair market value of  the individual\n\ncondominium  units.   Sensing as  much, at  the close  of the\n\nevidence Bay  Loan admitted  that its  claims were  premature\n\nunder Falmouth.   American Title responded that,  in order to\n              \n\nput an end to this litigation, it would concede that the fair\n\nmarket  value of  each unit  would  always be  less than  the\n\nuncollectible  debt   owed  by   each  defaulting   borrower.\n\nAmerican Title reiterated this point in its closing argument.\n\n          After all  was said  and done,  the district  court\n\nheld that,\n\n          the only  reasonable reading  of Falmouth\n                                                   \n          is  that a  mortgagee  must pursue  legal\n          action  against  a   defaulting  borrower\n          until a reasonable lender would write off\n          the debt as  uncollectible or, to  put it\n          another way,  until the  anticipated cost\n          of   further   proceedings   against  the\n          borrower would be greater than any amount\n          that is likely to be recovered.\n\nAmerican Title II, 817 F. Supp.  at 260.  It then found  that\n                 \n\nBay Loan had not reached this point on its claims.  Id.  \n                                                       \n\n          American  Title makes  two  principal arguments  on\n\nappeal.   First, it maintains  that Falmouth did  not prevent\n                                            \n\nthe district court  from reaching  the merits  of Bay  Loan's\n\nclaims  since  we have  never  \"held  that  suit against  the\n\nborrower  is required  before a  court may  conclude that  no\n                                                             \n\nactual loss has been sustained  on a title policy, based upon\n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nthe  insured's failure to  prove the other  elements that are\n\nrequired  to make a  claim of damages.\"   Plaintiff-Appellant\n\nBrief at 42.  Alternatively, American Title contends that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in dismissing the claims\n\nwithout  prejudice because the Falmouth issue was \"mooted\" by\n                                       \n\nits  concession that  the  uncollectible  balances  due  from\n\nborrowers  would always exceed  the value of  the collateral.\n\nBecause American  Title is  assigning error  to the  district\n\ncourt's  legal conclusion based upon its reading of Falmouth,\n                                                            \n\nour review is plenary.\n\n          We note first that this  case proceeded in a manner\n\nwholly  unlike Falmouth.   The present  case was  not decided\n                       \n\nthrough a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim made\n\nby  the insurer.  In contrast,  American Title advocated that\n\nthe district  court reach  the merits  of Bay Loan's  claims.\n\nHere, the insured's claims went to trial, and the insured was\n\nafforded a full and fair  opportunity to prove the amounts by\n\nwhich its collateral was impaired by the prior mortgages.  In\n\nfact, as  we noted above,  at the commencement of  the trial,\n\nBay Loan explicitly stated that  it planned to prove the fair\n\nmarket  value of all  the individual condominium  units, even\n\nwhere its  claim in connection  with that unit  was premature\n\nunder Falmouth.\n              \n\n          As evidenced by  its remarks at  the outset of  the\n\ntrial, Bay  Loan anticipated  that the  district court  would\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\nmake factual  findings as  to the fair  market value  of each\n\nunit,  and  that those  findings  would  be binding,  in  the\n\nfuture, on claims  that were still premature.   Bay Loan made\n\nits position clear, put its  best foot forward, and attempted\n\nto  prove the  fair  market value  of  the individual  units.\n\nFurthermore,  it is apparent that, long before American Title\n\nmade its concession, Bay Loan recognized that the fair market\n\nvalue of each unit would, in all likelihood, be less than the\n\nuncollectible debt owed by the defaulting borrowers.  This is\n\nreflected  in Bay Loan's statement that the fair market value\n\nof each unit would be \"the measure of [its] recovery.\"  \n\n          Under  these  circumstances,  we  believe that  the\n\ndistrict court committed reversible error by rigidly applying\n\nFalmouth to the present case, and failing to reach the merits\n        \n\nof Bay Loan's claims.  Falmouth was not intended to afford an\n                               \n\ninsured-mortgagee  second and  third  opportunities to  prove\n\nsomething that it  had otherwise been unable to  prove.  Once\n\nBay Loan made  its position  clear and  proceeded full  steam\n\nahead  on  all of  its  claims,  it  was incumbent  upon  the\n\ndistrict court to adjudicate each claim on the merits.8 \n\n                    \n\n8.  Moreover, we note that  one of our principal concerns  in\nFalmouth was the bank's attempt to make subrogation mandatory\n        \nby   requiring  the   insurance  company   to  purchase   the\noutstanding  indebtedness  prior to  a  determination of  the\nactual loss.  Here, Bay  Loan has not advanced this argument,\nbut has acknowledged that its measure of recovery is the fair\nmarket value  of the individual  units at the time  the prior\nmortgagee foreclosed.\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\n          Only  with respect to the claim under the Kirschner\n\npolicy did the district court  reach the merits of Bay Loan's\n\ndamages claim.  The court found that,\n\n               Bay  Loan  has been  afforded  every\n          opportunity to prove the  amount by which\n          the  value   of  its   security  in   the\n          Kirschner  unit  was  diminished  by  the\n          title defects.  Since it has failed to do\n          so,  its counterclaim  for damages  under\n          the  Kirschner policy  is dismissed  with\n          prejudice.\n\nAmerican  Title  II,  817  F. Supp.  at  261.    There  is no\n                   \n\nindication in the  record that Bay Loan's proof  on the other\n\nunits  was, or  would have  been, different  in  any material\n\nrespect  from its  proof on  the  Kirschner unit.   Bay  Loan\n\nanticipated that  the district court  would find that  it had\n\nproven the fair market value for  each of the units, and that\n\nupon maturity of its claims,  that value would be the measure\n\nof its recovery under the title policies.  Since Bay Loan has\n\ntried but did not  prove this value for any of  the units, it\n\nshould have to bear the consequences of its failure.\n\n          In   short  we   rule  that   the  district   court\n\nmisconstrued  the scope  of Falmouth  and that  Bay  Loan was\n                                    \n\ngiven every opportunity to prove damages but was unable to do\n\nso.  This  is not a case where the  district court foreclosed\n\nany avenues of proof.  There is no reason why Bay Loan should\n\nbe granted a third opportunity to prove damages.\n\n          There was another reason that compelled a dismissal\n\nwith  prejudice.  American  Title maintains that  it \"mooted\"\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nthe Falmouth issue, and that Bay Loan's claims were therefore\n            \n\nripe  for adjudication  on  the merits.    This argument  has\n\nmerit.   Under the  policies, the  Falmouth requirements  are\n                                           \n\nconditions precedent to the insurance company's obligation to\n\npay under  the policies.   Where,  as is  the case  here, the\n\ninsurer agrees to waive one of the conditions, this waiver is\n\neffective, and the insurer becomes obligated to pay under the\n\npolicy.   See  generally  Arthur  L.  Corbin,  3A  Corbin  on\n                        \n\nContracts   753 (1972) (condition to  party's duty to perform\n\ncan be eliminated  by a mere voluntary expression  of party's\n\nwillingness to waive it).\n\n          Moreover,  as  a  practical  matter, once  American\n\nTitle made its concession, Bay Loan's pending actions against\n\nthe debtors became irrelevant to the damages calculation.  In\n\nother words, the  resolution of those claims would not affect\n\nthe  amount  of  Bay Loan's  recovery  from  American Title.9\n\nFalmouth does not require  an insured to expend time,  effort\n        \n\nand  money in actions to collect against defaulting borrowers\n\nas   a  prerequisite  to  establishing  damages  against  the\n\n                    \n\n9.  In fact,  Bay Loan  could have realized  a windfall  as a\nresult  of this  concession.   If Bay  Loan had  succeeded in\nproving  the  fair  market   value  of  a  given   unit,  and\nsubsequently    recovered   substantial    sums   from    the\ncorresponding debtor such  that the fair market value  of the\nunit exceeded the  amount still owed by the  debtor, then Bay\nLoan  would  have recovered  more  than  it was  entitled  to\nrecover under its title insurance.\n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\ninsurer, where  those actions  are wholly  irrelevant to  the\n\nmeasure of the insured's recovery.\n\n          Thus,  the district court  should have  reached the\n\nmerits   of  Bay  Loan's  claims,  and  dismissed  them  with\n\nprejudice.  We reverse the district court's without prejudice\n\ndismissal   of  these  claims.     Our  disposition   of  the\n\nevidentiary   issue  raised  on  Bay  Loan's  appeal  of  the\n\ndismissal  of  the  Kirschner  claim  would  not  alter  this\n\nconclusion.    Because  Bay  Loan  did not  appeal  from  the\n\ndistrict  court's dismissal without  prejudice of its claims,\n\neven if we were to reverse the challenged evidentiary ruling,\n\nonly  the  Kirschner unit  would  enjoy the  benefit  of that\n\nruling.\n\nD. The Kirschner Unit\n                     \n\n          As previously indicated,  the district court  found\n\nthat  Bay Loan's claim  under the  title policy  covering the\n\nKirschner  unit was  not premature.10   But, the  court found\n\nthat Bay  Loan was unable to prove its damages on this claim,\n\nand  therefore dismissed it with prejudice.  Bay Loan appeals\n\nthis ruling primarily  on the ground that  the district court\n\nimproperly excluded the testimony of its expert appraiser.\n\n          Bay  Loan's  title  policy  provides  coverage  for\n\nlosses   arising  out  of  \"the  priority   of  any  lien  or\n\n                    \n\n10.  With the consent of American Title, Bay Loan settled its\nclaim against Kirschner for $15,000.   American Title II, 817\n                                                        \nF. Supp. at 260.\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\nencumbrance over the lien of the insured mortgage.\" (emphasis\n                                                 \n\nadded).  Each  insured mortgage at issue  here corresponds to\n\nan  individual condominium unit.   Accordingly, Bay  Loan was\n\nrequired  to  prove its  actual  loss  with respect  to  each\n\nindividual condominium  unit --  in this  case the  Kirschner\n\nunit.   Bay  Loan  planned to  do  this by  having an  expert\n\nappraiser  testify  as  to  the  fair  market  value  of  The\n\nCharlestown Motor Inn as an operating business.  See American\n                                                             \n\nTitle II, 817  F. Supp. at  261.  American Title  objected to\n        \n\nthe admission of  this testimony on the ground  that, without\n\nmore, the value of  the motel was not probative of  the value\n\nof each individual condominium unit.  After allowing Bay Loan\n\nto make an offer of proof, the court sustained the objection.\n\nThe court later explained:\n\n          Bay Loan  did proffer  evidence regarding\n          the value of The Charlestown Motor Inn as\n          an operating motel on the theory that the\n          value  of  each  individual   unit  is  a\n          proportionate  share   of  that   amount.\n          However, that  approach ignores  the fact\n          that  what  American  Title  insured  was\n          title to  and the validity of  Bay Loan's\n          mortgage liens on  individual condominium\n          units.  It  did not insure the  motels as\n          going   businesses   or  the   value   of\n          individual   units   calculated    as   a\n          percentage of the  motel's value.   Those\n          two values  may differ just  as the total\n          value of ten  residential lots comprising\n          a   city   block  may   be   considerably\n          different from  the value  of those  lots\n          when  combined  to  form  one  parcel  of\n          commercial real estate.\n\nId. at 261.\n   \n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\n          Bay  Loan argues that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion  in  excluding the  proposed testimony  because it\n\nshould be allowed to value the individual units by looking at\n\nthe motel qua  motel, since that represented  the highest and\n             \n\nbest use for  the units.  Bay Loan also argues that the value\n\nof  the motel represented the  best available evidence of the\n\nvalue of  the individual units  since the units could  not be\n\nindependently  appraised.    We  address  these   contentions\n\nseriatim keeping in mind that a  district court's decision to\n        \n\nexclude evidence  is reviewed  under an  abuse of  discretion\n\nstandard.   Losacco v. F.D.  Rich Constr. Co., 992  F.2d 382,\n                                             \n\n385 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 324 (1993); Harrison\n                                                             \n\nv. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 981 F.2d 25, 32 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                       \n\n          Bay  Loan's first contention  is wide of  the mark.\n\nAlthough  it might be that the \"highest and best\" use for the\n\nindividual   condominium  units  would  be  as  rooms  in  an\n\noperating  motel, this  is  not  what was  insured.   As  the\n\ndistrict court pointed  out, what was  insured was \"title  to\n\nand  the validity  of  .  . .  mortgage  liens on  individual\n                                                             \n\ncondominium units.\" Id.   While it  is true that a  number of\n                       \n\nthese units were located in the same motel, the insurance was\n\nnot issued on  this basis and did not  insure the condominium\n\nunits as potential  rooms in a motel.   We think the district\n\ncourt's  \"city block\" analogy  clearly illustrates  the basic\n\nflaw in Bay Loan's approach.  \n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\n          Next,  Bay Loan  maintains that  the  value of  the\n\nmotel is admissible  as the \"best available  evidence\" of the\n\nvalue of  the individual condominium units.   Even though the\n\n\"proportionate share\" motel's  value (i.e., the value  of the\n                                          \n\nmotel divided by the number of individual condominium units),\n\nmight be the best  evidence of the value of each  unit, it is\n     \n\nnot necessarily so.  See Allison v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 907\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 645 (7th Cir. 1990).   A given unit might be worth  more\n\nor less than the value of the  motel divided by the number of\n\nunits.    It  was  Bay  Loan's  responsibility  to  introduce\n\nevidence as to  the value of each  unit so that the  district\n\ncourt could make  a determination of damages.   As the record\n\nplainly  indicates, Bay  Loan  did not  intend  to offer  any\n\nevidence  which would  connect its  expert's  opinion on  the\n\nvalue  of  the entire  motel,  to  the  value  of  individual\n\ncondominium units.11\n\n          Had Bay  Loan's  expert witness  been  prepared  to\n\ntestify  that,  although  he  could  not  directly   appraise\n\nindividual  units, the proportionate  value of the  motel was\n\nrelevant in determining  the value of the units,  we might be\n\n                    \n\n11.  After Bay  Loan made its  offer of proof,  the following\ndialogue took place:\n               THE COURT:  And who is going to make\n          that link, me, the Court?\n               BAY LOAN:   Well, the  Court is  the\n          trier of fact in this case, that's true.\n               THE COURT:    Well, it  has to  have\n          facts to try, doesn't it? \n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\ninclined to side  with Bay Loan.  See  Allison v. Ticor Title\n                                                             \n\nIns.

Because this  was not the\n\ncase, we  cannot see  how the court's  ruling amounted  to an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n          Finally, Bay Loan contends that notwithstanding the\n\nexclusion of this evidence, it  still proved its damages with\n\nrespect  to the  Kirschner  unit.

The  prior  mortgage  on   The  Charlestown  Motor   Inn\noriginally covered the  entire motel.

In fact,  the  parties  stipulated that  the  prior\n\nmortgage  covering these seventeen  units was not  subject to\n\nthe  condominium declaration.    Because  Bay  Loan  did  not\n\nintroduce any evidence of a correlation between  the value of\n\none-half the  motel and the  value of the Kirschner  unit, we\n\ncan  find  no  error, clear  or  otherwise,  in the  district\n\ncourt's findings and ruling.\n\n                             III.\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          We affirm the judgment of  the district court as to\n\nAmerican Title's liability under the title insurance policies\n\nat issue here.

Secs. 2201 and 2202 seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not liable under lender title insurance policies issued to defendants Bay Loan &amp; Investment Bank (\"Bay Loan\") and East West Financial Corporation (\"East West\").  Bay Loan and East West counterclaimed for breach of contract and bad faith refusal to pay and sought payment under the policies.  After a bench trial the district court (Boyle, C.J.) found that defendants were entitled to coverage under the insurance policies, and granted declaratory judgment in their favor.  The court found that defendants' counterclaims for damages were premature and dismissed them without prejudice.  Both parties appealed, and in March 1992, we remanded the case for a \"total new trial on the merits\" because Judge Boyle had improperly allocated the burden of proof on the issue of apparent authority.  See American Title Ins. v. East West Financial Corp., 959 F.2d 345, 349 (1st Cir.1992) (\"American Title I \").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand the case was assigned to Judge Torres and retried.  It has now worked its way back up to us.  American Title and Bay Loan appeal from various aspects of the judgment entered below.  See American Title Ins. v. East West Financial Corp., 817 F.Supp. 251 (D.R.I.1993) (\"American Title II \").   We affirm the district court's ruling on liability and its dismissal with prejudice of Bay Loan's claim under one of the insurance policies, but reverse its dismissal without prejudice of Bay Loan's claims arising under the remaining policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe only those facts pertinent to the legal issues presented on these appeals.  In the late 1980s, Peter Brandon, one of the principals of Dean Street Development Company (\"Dean Street\"), offered investors a deal for motel condominium units.  \"Buyers were promised a deal where no money down was required;  guaranteed they could not lose money;  and assured that they would receive a five percent return on the initial purchase price in five years.\"  American Title I, 959 F.2d at 346.   The deal collapsed and Brandon and his associates were convicted of defrauding Bay Loan out of millions of dollars by fraudulently representing the existence of down payments required by Bay Loan from the investors on whose behalf the loans were made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dean Street bought operating motels in Rhode Island and used purchase money mortgages to finance each purchase.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  It would then \"condominiumize\" each motel and market titles to the individual units.  Dean Street arranged financing for the buyers through East West and Bay Loan.  East West originated the loans and then sold them to Bay Loan, which actually advanced the funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Closings on the individual units were conducted at the law offices of George Marderosian in Providence, Rhode Island.  Although Marderosian's original involvement in these transactions was as Dean Street's lawyer, he eventually came to represent both Dean Street and the buyers in these transactions.  All of the buyers consented to this arrangement.  Marderosian also served as \"settlement agent\" or \"closing attorney\" at the closings and was an authorized agent of American Title.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Dean Street could not obtain partial releases on its purchase money mortgages, it had to sell a number of condominium units before enough funds were raised to discharge the prior mortgages.  Once enough units were sold, closings were held on each unit, and East West bundled the loans and sent them as a package to Bay Loan.  Among the documents forwarded to Bay Loan were the closing documents along with mortgages and title insurance policies on the individual condominium units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of this was done before Bay Loan formally purchased the loans from East West.  Although Bay Loan retained the right to reject any loan, it never exercised this right.  When a loan was approved, Bay Loan would wire the proceeds to East West, and East West would distribute the funds to Marderosian's trust account.  Even though the prior mortgages had not yet been paid off, the title insurance policies issued by Marderosian were ostensibly \"clean.\"   That was, they indicated that the units were not subject to any prior defects, liens or encumbrances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties orally agreed that Marderosian would use the loan proceeds to discharge the prior mortgages so that Bay Loan's mortgage would be primary.  Bay Loan soon discovered that the prior mortgages were not being discharged.  This was because Marderosian had been \"diverting\" the loan proceeds to Dean Street instead of using them to discharge prior mortgages.  American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 255.   Dean Street, or more precisely, Peter Brandon converted the funds for personal use.  The prior mortgagees foreclosed, thereby extinguishing Bay Loan's mortgages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, Bay Loan filed a notice of claim with American Title under the title insurance policies.  In response American Title filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island seeking declaratory judgment relieving it from liability under the policies.  Bay Loan and East West counterclaimed for breach of contract and bad faith refusal to pay.  In an opinion dated April 10, 1991, Judge Boyle held that American Title was liable under the title insurance policies, but dismissed defendants' counterclaims as premature.  Both sides appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remanded the case for a new trial because Judge Boyle had erroneously burdened American Title with disproving Marderosian's apparent authority to issue \"clean\" title insurance policies on its behalf.  We held that the burden was on the defendants to prove the existence of Marderosian's apparent authority.  After the second trial, Judge Torres found that Bay Loan's claim with respect to the insurance policy relating to the unit owned by Norma Kirschner in The Charlestown Motor Inn (the \"Kirschner unit\"), was not premature.  The court found that Bay Loan failed to prove its damages on that claim and dismissed the claim with prejudice.  It, however, dismissed without prejudice Bay Loan's claims under the remaining policies.  These appeals ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, we disagree with Judge Torres' conclusion that the case was remanded for something short of a \"total new trial on the merits.\"   See American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 256-58.   Therefore, Judge Torres' \"alternative findings,\" and not Judge Boyle's earlier findings are currently before this court for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's factual findings for clear error.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a);  Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1992).  Under this standard, we must affirm the district court unless, after reviewing the entire record, this court \"is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"  United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948);  see also Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., 9 F.3d 175, 180 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that \"the clear error hurdle is ... quite high.\")  (quoting Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1087 (1st Cir.1993)).  The same standard applies to mixed questions of law and fact.  Rulings of law, however, are subject to de novo review.  Boston Beer Co., 9 F.3d at 180.   In diversity cases, questions of local law, in this case Rhode Island law, are given plenary review.  See Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 230, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 1221, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991);  Blanchard v. Peerless Ins. Co., 958 F.2d 483, 487 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

National Football League Players Association, 438 F.Supp. 337, 342 (D.R.I.1975), aff'd, 550 F.2d 1287 (1st Cir.1977));  see also Menard &amp; Co. Masonry v. Marshall Bldg., 539 A.2d 523, 526 (R.I.1988) (agent's apparent authority arises from principal's manifestation of such authority to party with whom agent contracts and that person's belief that the agent has authority to bind principal to the contract).  Of course, this determination is factual in nature.  Calenda, 518 A.2d at 618.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bay Loan presented evidence that Marderosian was authorized to write title insurance policies for American Title, that he possessed all of the necessary forms for doing so, and that he carried a \"To whom it may concern\" letter from American Title announcing his position as an authorized agent of that company.  Moreover, it is undisputed that American Title never informed Bay Loan that Marderosian was not empowered to issue clean title policies in the face of prior undischarged liens unless the funds required to pay them were in the agent's possession and the lender was an institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title argues that, because there were substantial deviations from accepted business practices in the Dean Street transactions, Bay Loan's reliance on Marderosian's apparent authority was unreasonable and therefore his acts should not be imputed to American Title.  See, e.g., Sheldon v. First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass'n, 566 F.2d 805, 809 (1st Cir.1977) (third party must exercise due care before relying on an agent's apparent authority);  Restatement (Second) Agency Sec. 27 comt. a (1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title illustrates three departures from the \"usual methods of conducting business\":  (1) conducting apparently final closings prior to Bay Loan's actual approval of the borrower, (2) Marderosian's issuance of clean title policies to Bay Loan prior to Bay Loan providing the funding to discharge the prior mortgages, and (3) Bay Loan's receipt of HUD 1's which indicated that the seller would receive all of the loan proceeds without diminution for amounts needed to discharge prior mortgages.  The same arguments were presented to the district court which found the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was no reason for East West or Bay Loan to believe that there was anything improper about issuing the policies before prior mortgages were discharged.  It was common practice among title attorneys to use the proceeds of purchase money mortgages to discharge prior mortgages after closing.  Although it was less common for an attorney to issue a title policy before prior mortgages were discharged, that practice was acceptable when the attorney had adequate assurances that the funds required to pay such mortgage would be forthcoming and that the mortgagees would, in fact, execute discharges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, East West and Bay Loan had no cause to be concerned about the availability of funds necessary to pay prior mortgages because Bay Loan itself was the source of those funds.  Furthermore, unless the funds were advanced, Bay Loan would not have been at risk because it would have had no mortgages.  Finally, East West and Bay Loan had no reason to doubt Marderosian's assurances that the proceeds of their loans would be used to discharge prior mortgages.  Indeed, it would be unreasonable to conclude that they would have made such loans if they suspected otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, under the circumstances, it was perfectly reasonable for East West and Bay Loan to believe that Marderosian was authorized to issue \"clean\" title policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 259.   We have conducted an exhaustive review of the record and can find no compelling evidence to the contrary.  Bay Loan plausibly explained why each \"departure\" was not sufficient to raise any eyebrows at the time it occurred.  The district court credited Bay Loan's explanations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the benefit of hindsight American Title has strung together distinct aspects of these transactions and argues that Bay Loan's belief in Marderosian's apparent authority was clearly unreasonable.  The question we must ask, however, is whether Bay Loan's reliance on Marderosian's apparent authority to issue \"clean\" title policies was reasonable in light of what Bay Loan knew at the time.  The district court found that it was, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Policy Exclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As its second rationale for relief, American Title argues that Bay Loan is not entitled to recovery because the title policies exclude coverage for encumbrances \"created, suffered, assumed or agreed to by the insured claimant.\"   Where an insurance company seeks to deny coverage under a policy exclusion, it carries the burden of proving that the exclusion applies.  Pickering v.  American Employers Ins. Co., 109 R.I. 143, 282 A.2d 584, 587 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that Rhode Island law applies to this defense.  Although Rhode Island courts have not interpreted this clause, courts in other jurisdictions have generally held that \"the insurer can escape liability only if it is established that the defect, lien or encumbrance resulted from some intentional misconduct or inequitable dealings by the insured or the insured either expressly or impliedly assumed or agreed to the defects or encumbrances.\"  Brown v. Saint Paul Title Ins. Corp., 634 F.2d 1103, 1107-08 n. 8 (8th Cir.1980) (Missouri law);  see also First Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. Fidelity Nat. Tit.  Ins. Co., 572 F.2d 155 (8th Cir.1978) (under Nebraska law insurer must establish by a preponderance that the insured agreed that its mortgage would occupy a secondary position to the preexisting mortgage);  accord American Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp., 793 F.2d 780 (6th Cir.1986) (Tennessee law);  Transamerica Title Ins. Co. v. Alaska Fed.  Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 833 F.2d 775 (9th Cir.1987) (Alaska law).  This construction of the exclusionary clause comports with Rhode Island law.  See Bartlett v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., 593 A.2d 45, 48 (R.I.1991) (exclusionary clauses subject to more than one interpretation are to be construed in the manner most favorable to the insured);  see also Sentry Ins. Co. v. Grenga, 556 A.2d 998, 999 (R.I.1989) (insurance contract provisions subject to more than one interpretation are construed strictly against the insurer);  West v. Commercial Ins. Co., 528 A.2d 339, 341-42 n. 2 (R.I.1987) (same);  Conanicut Marine Serv., Inc. v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 511 A.2d 967, 970 (R.I.1986) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After stating the correct legal standard, the district court found that American Title had not met its burden of proof.  The court added that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>Marderosian had apparent authority to issue \"clean\" title policies on behalf of American Title.  In doing so, he acted as American Title's agent, not Bay Loan's agent.  Moreover, East West and Bay Loan justifiably relied on Marderosian's representations that he would use the loan proceeds to discharge prior mortgages and were unaware that he did otherwise.  Therefore the defects in title against which the policies insure were neither created, suffered nor assumed by East West or Bay Loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 263.   We agree with the district court that Bay Loan did not act in the manner which would bar recovery under the policy exclusion.  It is uncontroverted that Bay Loan relied on Marderosian to pay off the prior mortgage and believed that it would be paid off in the normal course.  It is also undisputed that Bay Loan intended that the proceeds from its loans be used to pay off the prior mortgages, and that its mortgages be the only encumbrances on the properties.

Further, the principal must have the right to control the work of the agent, and the agent must act primarily for the benefit of the principal.  Id. (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title offered testimony that, generally speaking, an attorney who serves as the \"settlement agent\" or \"closing agent\" at a closing is an agent of the lender and is responsible for disbursing loan proceeds on the lender's behalf.  In addition, Marderosian designated himself on the HUD 1 form as the \"settlement agent.\"   There was also testimony from representatives of East West and Bay Loan that could have supported a finding that Marderosian acted as Bay Loan's agent at the closings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, our review of the record reveals that there was no express agreement in this regard between Bay Loan and Marderosian.  Furthermore, Bay Loan did not provide any instructions to or exert any control over Marderosian, and Bay Loan did not participate in the payment of Marderosian as closing attorney.  In addition, the record is unclear as to how Marderosian became the closing agent in the first place.  The district court found that Marderosian was not Bay Loan's agent.  \"Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.\"  American Title I, 959 F.2d at 346 (quoting Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990) (quotation omitted)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's finding that the continued existence of the prior mortgages was not \"created, suffered, assumed or agreed to\" by Bay Loan within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

[t]he invalidity or unenforceability of the lien of the insured mortgage ... [or t]he priority of any lien or encumbrance over the lien of the insured mortgage.\"   American Title's liability is limited to the lesser of:  (1) Bay Loan's actual loss;  (2) the amount of insurance;  or (3) the indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage at the time of the loss.  Only the first of these remained unknown prior to trial.  Both parties and the district court acknowledged that, because Bay Loan's mortgages were rendered worthless when the prior mortgagee foreclosed, its actual loss under each policy would be the lesser of (1) the amount uncollectible from the defaulting borrower, or (2) the fair market value of the unit at the time the prior mortgagee foreclosed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed, without prejudice, Bay Loan's policy claims in connection with all but the Kirschner unit on the ground that its claims were premature under Falmouth Nat. Bank v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 920 F.2d 1058 (1st Cir.1990).  On appeal, American Title argues that the district court should have reached the merits of Bay Loan's damage claims with respect to all eighty units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Falmouth we held that a bank's claim for damages under a mortgagee's title insurance policy was premature because the amount of the loss was not \"definitely fixed.\"   The relevant provision, which also appears in Bay Loan's title policies, provides:  \"When liability has been definitely fixed in accordance with the conditions of this policy, the loss or damage shall be payable within 30 days thereafter.\"  (emphasis added).  In fact, there is no material difference between Bay Loan's policies and the policy construed in Falmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Falmouth, the insured brought an action against its title insurer for failure to pay a loss under a mortgagee's title insurance policy after liability had been determined against the insurer by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) in a related action.  The SJC remanded the case for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The insurance company moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim arguing that the bank's \"actual loss\" could not be determined until the state court determined the value of the property on remand.  The bank argued that liability was definitely fixed by the SJC's ruling, and that the insurance company was liable for the principal and accrued interest outstanding on the buyer's mortgage note.  The district court agreed with the insurance company, and we affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In affirming the dismissal, we construed the terms of the title insurance policy, focusing on the issue of when a loss is \"definitely fixed\" and payable to the insured.  We distinguished owner's title insurance policies, in which loss is measured by the decrease in market value caused by a title defect, and mortgagee's title policies in which a bank's loss equals the lesser of the decrease in market value of the bank's security caused by the title defect or the amount that is unrecoverable on the borrower's defaulted notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the mortgagee's policies at issue we held that \"a mortgagee-insured's loss cannot be determined unless the note is not repaid and the security for the mortgage proves inadequate....  Such is the case because it is only after the insurer or the insured sues on the note and the debtor fails to pay, that the actual loss can be determined.\"  Falmouth, 920 F.2d at 1063 (citations omitted).  The bank took the position that the insurer should be required to pay the outstanding principal, interest and late payments due on the debt, and subrogate to the bank's rights.  We rejected this argument because the insurance policy gave the insurer the option to either pay the bank's actual loss, or purchase the indebtedness and subrogate to the bank's rights against the mortgagors.  We held that to require the insurance company to pay the indebtedness before the \"actual loss\" is ascertained, \"would have the effect of amending the policy by making subrogation mandatory rather than optional.\"  Falmouth, 920 F.2d at 1063.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn our attention to the case at hand.  At the commencement of the second trial, Bay Loan took the position that because it had commenced suits against all the defaulting borrowers, it had satisfied the requirements of Falmouth at least with respect to some of the units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  American Title was of the opinion that Bay Loan would not be able to prove the fair market value of the individual units, but that even if it could, its claims were premature under Falmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court asked Bay Loan what the court should do if some but not all of the claims were premature under Falmouth, Bay Loan responded as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>I think that the appropriate relief in those circumstances if the Court rules that Falmouth does apply in part to this case, would be for the Court to make appropriate findings and conclusions which would be necessary as to those borrowers for whom we have fulfilled the requirements of Falmouth.   The same findings and conclusions would ultimately apply presumedly to the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Bay Loan added:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>About the measure of the recovery ... we contend that the measure of recovery is the fair market value of the condominiums at the time they were lost at the foreclosure of senior liens and we are prepared to prove what that value was.  If the Court finds that some other measure would be more appropriate or if the Court should disagree with our valuation and decide they were worth some different amount, you know, appropriate findings and conclusions could be made so that as litigation with other borrowers is resolved, either by judgments or by bankruptcies or however they get resolved, both Bay Loan and American Title would know what the other's rights are.  And I think that would be easy enough to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the trial progressed, it became clear that Bay Loan would not be able to prove the fair market value of the individual condominium units.  Sensing as much, at the close of the evidence Bay Loan admitted that its claims were premature under Falmouth.   American Title responded that, in order to put an end to this litigation, it would concede that the fair market value of each unit would always be less than the uncollectible debt owed by each defaulting borrower.  American Title reiterated this point in its closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After all was said and done, the district court held that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>the only reasonable reading of Falmouth is that a mortgagee must pursue legal action against a defaulting borrower until a reasonable lender would write off the debt as uncollectible or, to put it another way, until the anticipated cost of further proceedings against the borrower would be greater than any amount that is likely to be recovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 260.   It then found that Bay Loan had not reached this point on its claims.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title makes two principal arguments on appeal.  First, it maintains that Falmouth did not prevent the district court from reaching the merits of Bay Loan's claims since we have never \"held that suit against the borrower is required before a court may conclude that no actual loss has been sustained on a title policy, based upon the insured's failure to prove the other elements that are required to make a claim of damages.\"   Plaintiff-Appellant Brief at 42.  Alternatively, American Title contends that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the claims without prejudice because the Falmouth issue was \"mooted\" by its concession that the uncollectible balances due from borrowers would always exceed the value of the collateral.  Because American Title is assigning error to the district court's legal conclusion based upon its reading of Falmouth, our review is plenary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note first that this case proceeded in a manner wholly unlike Falmouth.   The present case was not decided through a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim made by the insurer.  In contrast, American Title advocated that the district court reach the merits of Bay Loan's claims.  Here, the insured's claims went to trial, and the insured was afforded a full and fair opportunity to prove the amounts by which its collateral was impaired by the prior mortgages.  In fact, as we noted above, at the commencement of the trial, Bay Loan explicitly stated that it planned to prove the fair market value of all the individual condominium units, even where its claim in connection with that unit was premature under Falmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As evidenced by its remarks at the outset of the trial, Bay Loan anticipated that the district court would make factual findings as to the fair market value of each unit, and that those findings would be binding, in the future, on claims that were still premature. Bay Loan made its position clear, put its best foot forward, and attempted to prove the fair market value of the individual units.  Furthermore, it is apparent that, long before American Title made its concession, Bay Loan recognized that the fair market value of each unit would, in all likelihood, be less than the uncollectible debt owed by the defaulting borrowers.  This is reflected in Bay Loan's statement that the fair market value of each unit would be \"the measure of [its] recovery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we believe that the district court committed reversible error by rigidly applying Falmouth to the present case, and failing to reach the merits of Bay Loan's claims.  Falmouth was not intended to afford an insured-mortgagee second and third opportunities to prove something that it had otherwise been unable to prove.  Once Bay Loan made its position clear and proceeded full steam ahead on all of its claims, it was incumbent upon the district court to adjudicate each claim on the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only with respect to the claim under the Kirschner policy did the district court reach the merits of Bay Loan's damages claim.  The court found that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bay Loan has been afforded every opportunity to prove the amount by which the value of its security in the Kirschner unit was diminished by the title defects.  Since it has failed to do so, its counterclaim for damages under the Kirschner policy is dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 261.   There is no indication in the record that Bay Loan's proof on the other units was, or would have been, different in any material respect from its proof on the Kirschner unit.  Bay Loan anticipated that the district court would find that it had proven the fair market value for each of the units, and that upon maturity of its claims, that value would be the measure of its recovery under the title policies.  Since Bay Loan has tried but did not prove this value for any of the units, it should have to bear the consequences of its failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short we rule that the district court misconstrued the scope of Falmouth and that Bay Loan was given every opportunity to prove damages but was unable to do so.  This is not a case where the district court foreclosed any avenues of proof.  There is no reason why Bay Loan should be granted a third opportunity to prove damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was another reason that compelled a dismissal with prejudice.  American Title maintains that it \"mooted\" the Falmouth issue, and that Bay Loan's claims were therefore ripe for adjudication on the merits.  This argument has merit.  Under the policies, the Falmouth requirements are conditions precedent to the insurance company's obligation to pay under the policies.  Where, as is the case here, the insurer agrees to waive one of the conditions, this waiver is effective, and the insurer becomes obligated to pay under the policy.  See generally Arthur L. Corbin, 3A Corbin on Contracts Sec. 753 (1972) (condition to party's duty to perform can be eliminated by a mere voluntary expression of party's willingness to waive it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as a practical matter, once American Title made its concession, Bay Loan's pending actions against the debtors became irrelevant to the damages calculation.  In other words, the resolution of those claims would not affect the amount of Bay Loan's recovery from American Title.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Falmouth does not require an insured to expend time, effort and money in actions to collect against defaulting borrowers as a prerequisite to establishing damages against the insurer, where those actions are wholly irrelevant to the measure of the insured's recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the district court should have reached the merits of Bay Loan's claims, and dismissed them with prejudice.  We reverse the district court's without prejudice dismissal of these claims.  Our disposition of the evidentiary issue raised on Bay Loan's appeal of the dismissal of the Kirschner claim would not alter this conclusion.  Because Bay Loan did not appeal from the district court's dismissal without prejudice of its claims, even if we were to reverse the challenged evidentiary ruling, only the Kirschner unit would enjoy the benefit of that ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. The Kirschner Unit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously indicated, the district court found that Bay Loan's claim under the title policy covering the Kirschner unit was not premature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  But, the court found that Bay Loan was unable to prove its damages on this claim, and therefore dismissed it with prejudice.  Bay Loan appeals this ruling primarily on the ground that the district court improperly excluded the testimony of its expert appraiser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bay Loan's title policy provides coverage for losses arising out of \"the priority of any lien or encumbrance over the lien of the insured mortgage.\"  (emphasis added).  Each insured mortgage at issue here corresponds to an individual condominium unit.  Accordingly, Bay Loan was required to prove its actual loss with respect to each individual condominium unit--in this case the Kirschner unit.  Bay Loan planned to do this by having an expert appraiser testify as to the fair market value of The Charlestown Motor Inn as an operating business.  See American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 261.   American Title objected to the admission of this testimony on the ground that, without more, the value of the motel was not probative of the value of each individual condominium unit.  After allowing Bay Loan to make an offer of proof, the court sustained the objection.  The court later explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>Bay Loan did proffer evidence regarding the value of The Charlestown Motor Inn as an operating motel on the theory that the value of each individual unit is a proportionate share of that amount.  However, that approach ignores the fact that what American Title insured was title to and the validity of Bay Loan's mortgage liens on individual condominium units.  It did not insure the motels as going businesses or the value of individual units calculated as a percentage of the motel's value.  Those two values may differ just as the total value of ten residential lots comprising a city block may be considerably different from the value of those lots when combined to form one parcel of commercial real estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 261.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bay Loan argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the proposed testimony because it should be allowed to value the individual units by looking at the motel qua motel, since that represented the highest and best use for the units.  Bay Loan also argues that the value of the motel represented the best available evidence of the value of the individual units since the units could not be independently appraised.  We address these contentions seriatim keeping in mind that a district court's decision to exclude evidence is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.  Losacco v. F.D. Rich Constr.  Co., 992 F.2d 382, 385 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 324, 126 L.Ed.2d 270 (1993);  Harrison v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 981 F.2d 25, 32 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bay Loan's first contention is wide of the mark.  Although it might be that the \"highest and best\" use for the individual condominium units would be as rooms in an operating motel, this is not what was insured.  As the district court pointed out, what was insured was \"title to and the validity of ... mortgage liens on individual condominium units.\"  Id.  While it is true that a number of these units were located in the same motel, the insurance was not issued on this basis and did not insure the condominium units as potential rooms in a motel.  We think the district court's \"city block\" analogy clearly illustrates the basic flaw in Bay Loan's approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Bay Loan maintains that the value of the motel is admissible as the \"best available evidence\" of the value of the individual condominium units.  Even though the \"proportionate share\" motel's value (i.e., the value of the motel divided by the number of individual condominium units), might be the best evidence of the value of each unit, it is not necessarily so.  See Allison v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 907 F.2d 645 (7th Cir.1990).  A given unit might be worth more or less than the value of the motel divided by the number of units.  It was Bay Loan's responsibility to introduce evidence as to the value of each unit so that the district court could make a determination of damages.  As the record plainly indicates, Bay Loan did not intend to offer any evidence which would connect its expert's opinion on the value of the entire motel, to the value of individual condominium units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Bay Loan's expert witness been prepared to testify that, although he could not directly appraise individual units, the proportionate value of the motel was relevant in determining the value of the units, we might be inclined to side with Bay Loan.  See Allison v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 979 F.2d 1187 (7th Cir.1992) (holding that district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of lodge's value where value of individual units in the lodge was at issue, particularly where expert witness testified that he looked at the proportionate value of lodge in valuing the individual units).  Because this was not the case, we cannot see how the court's ruling amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bay Loan contends that notwithstanding the exclusion of this evidence, it still proved its damages with respect to the Kirschner unit.  We review the district court's determination of damages for clear error.  Soto v. United States, 11 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[D]etermining damages ... falls within the sound judgment and discretion of the factfinder and will not be overridden without substantial cause.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only evidence offered by Bay Loan with respect to its damages on its claim under the Kirschner policy was the sale price received by the prior mortgagee when he foreclosed on seventeen of the thirty-three units in The Charlestown Motor Inn, one of which was the Kirschner unit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  What Bay Loan fails to realize is that the sale price obtained by the prior mortgagee at foreclosure represents the value of approximately one-half of the entire motel, not the value of seventeen individual condominium units.  In fact, the parties stipulated that the prior mortgage covering these seventeen units was not subject to the condominium declaration.  Because Bay Loan did not introduce any evidence of a correlation between the value of one-half the motel and the value of the Kirschner unit, we can find no error, clear or otherwise, in the district court's findings and ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment of the district court as to American Title's liability under the title insurance policies at issue here.  We also affirm the district court's dismissal with prejudice of Bay Loan's claim under the Kirschner policy.

After a bench trial the district court (Boyle, C.J.) found that defendants were entitled to coverage under the insurance policies, and granted declaratory judgment in their favor.  The court found that defendants' counterclaims for damages were premature and dismissed them without prejudice.

We affirm the district court's ruling on liability and its dismissal with prejudice of Bay Loan's claim under one of the insurance policies, but reverse its dismissal without prejudice of Bay Loan's claims arising under the remaining policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe only those facts pertinent to the legal issues presented on these appeals.  In the late 1980s, Peter Brandon, one of the principals of Dean Street Development Company (\"Dean Street\"), offered investors a deal for motel condominium units.  \"Buyers were promised a deal where no money down was required;  guaranteed they could not lose money;  and assured that they would receive a five percent return on the initial purchase price in five years.\"  American Title I, 959 F.2d at 346.   The deal collapsed and Brandon and his associates were convicted of defrauding Bay Loan out of millions of dollars by fraudulently representing the existence of down payments required by Bay Loan from the investors on whose behalf the loans were made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dean Street bought operating motels in Rhode Island and used purchase money mortgages to finance each purchase.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  It would then \"condominiumize\" each motel and market titles to the individual units.  Dean Street arranged financing for the buyers through East West and Bay Loan.  East West originated the loans and then sold them to Bay Loan, which actually advanced the funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Closings on the individual units were conducted at the law offices of George Marderosian in Providence, Rhode Island.  Although Marderosian's original involvement in these transactions was as Dean Street's lawyer, he eventually came to represent both Dean Street and the buyers in these transactions.  All of the buyers consented to this arrangement.  Marderosian also served as \"settlement agent\" or \"closing attorney\" at the closings and was an authorized agent of American Title.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Dean Street could not obtain partial releases on its purchase money mortgages, it had to sell a number of condominium units before enough funds were raised to discharge the prior mortgages.  Once enough units were sold, closings were held on each unit, and East West bundled the loans and sent them as a package to Bay Loan.  Among the documents forwarded to Bay Loan were the closing documents along with mortgages and title insurance policies on the individual condominium units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of this was done before Bay Loan formally purchased the loans from East West.  Although Bay Loan retained the right to reject any loan, it never exercised this right.  When a loan was approved, Bay Loan would wire the proceeds to East West, and East West would distribute the funds to Marderosian's trust account.  Even though the prior mortgages had not yet been paid off, the title insurance policies issued by Marderosian were ostensibly \"clean.\"   That was, they indicated that the units were not subject to any prior defects, liens or encumbrances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties orally agreed that Marderosian would use the loan proceeds to discharge the prior mortgages so that Bay Loan's mortgage would be primary.  Bay Loan soon discovered that the prior mortgages were not being discharged.  This was because Marderosian had been \"diverting\" the loan proceeds to Dean Street instead of using them to discharge prior mortgages.  American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 255.   Dean Street, or more precisely, Peter Brandon converted the funds for personal use.  The prior mortgagees foreclosed, thereby extinguishing Bay Loan's mortgages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, Bay Loan filed a notice of claim with American Title under the title insurance policies.  In response American Title filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island seeking declaratory judgment relieving it from liability under the policies.  Bay Loan and East West counterclaimed for breach of contract and bad faith refusal to pay.  In an opinion dated April 10, 1991, Judge Boyle held that American Title was liable under the title insurance policies, but dismissed defendants' counterclaims as premature.  Both sides appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remanded the case for a new trial because Judge Boyle had erroneously burdened American Title with disproving Marderosian's apparent authority to issue \"clean\" title insurance policies on its behalf.  We held that the burden was on the defendants to prove the existence of Marderosian's apparent authority.  After the second trial, Judge Torres found that Bay Loan's claim with respect to the insurance policy relating to the unit owned by Norma Kirschner in The Charlestown Motor Inn (the \"Kirschner unit\"), was not premature.  The court found that Bay Loan failed to prove its damages on that claim and dismissed the claim with prejudice.  It, however, dismissed without prejudice Bay Loan's claims under the remaining policies.  These appeals ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, we disagree with Judge Torres' conclusion that the case was remanded for something short of a \"total new trial on the merits.\"   See American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 256-58.   Therefore, Judge Torres' \"alternative findings,\" and not Judge Boyle's earlier findings are currently before this court for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's factual findings for clear error.

Moreover, it is undisputed that American Title never informed Bay Loan that Marderosian was not empowered to issue clean title policies in the face of prior undischarged liens unless the funds required to pay them were in the agent's possession and the lender was an institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title argues that, because there were substantial deviations from accepted business practices in the Dean Street transactions, Bay Loan's reliance on Marderosian's apparent authority was unreasonable and therefore his acts should not be imputed to American Title.  See, e.g., Sheldon v. First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350996\"><a href=\"/opinion/350996/alice-sheldon-v-first-federal-savings-loan-association-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>, 809 (1st Cir.1977) (third party must exercise due care before relying on an agent's apparent authority);  Restatement (Second) Agency Sec. 27 comt. a (1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title illustrates three departures from the \"usual methods of conducting business\":  (1) conducting apparently final closings prior to Bay Loan's actual approval of the borrower, (2) Marderosian's issuance of clean title policies to Bay Loan prior to Bay Loan providing the funding to discharge the prior mortgages, and (3) Bay Loan's receipt of HUD 1's which indicated that the seller would receive all of the loan proceeds without diminution for amounts needed to discharge prior mortgages.  The same arguments were presented to the district court which found the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was no reason for East West or Bay Loan to believe that there was anything improper about issuing the policies before prior mortgages were discharged.  It was common practice among title attorneys to use the proceeds of purchase money mortgages to discharge prior mortgages after closing.  Although it was less common for an attorney to issue a title policy before prior mortgages were discharged, that practice was acceptable when the attorney had adequate assurances that the funds required to pay such mortgage would be forthcoming and that the mortgagees would, in fact, execute discharges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, East West and Bay Loan had no cause to be concerned about the availability of funds necessary to pay prior mortgages because Bay Loan itself was the source of those funds.  Furthermore, unless the funds were advanced, Bay Loan would not have been at risk because it would have had no mortgages.  Finally, East West and Bay Loan had no reason to doubt Marderosian's assurances that the proceeds of their loans would be used to discharge prior mortgages.  Indeed, it would be unreasonable to conclude that they would have made such loans if they suspected otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, under the circumstances, it was perfectly reasonable for East West and Bay Loan to believe that Marderosian was authorized to issue \"clean\" title policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 259.   We have conducted an exhaustive review of the record and can find no compelling evidence to the contrary.  Bay Loan plausibly explained why each \"departure\" was not sufficient to raise any eyebrows at the time it occurred.  The district court credited Bay Loan's explanations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the benefit of hindsight American Title has strung together distinct aspects of these transactions and argues that Bay Loan's belief in Marderosian's apparent authority was clearly unreasonable.  The question we must ask, however, is whether Bay Loan's reliance on Marderosian's apparent authority to issue \"clean\" title policies was reasonable in light of what Bay Loan knew at the time.  The district court found that it was, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Policy Exclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As its second rationale for relief, American Title argues that Bay Loan is not entitled to recovery because the title policies exclude coverage for encumbrances \"created, suffered, assumed or agreed to by the insured claimant.\"   Where an insurance company seeks to deny coverage under a policy exclusion, it carries the burden of proving that the exclusion applies.

Moreover, East West and Bay Loan justifiably relied on Marderosian's representations that he would use the loan proceeds to discharge prior mortgages and were unaware that he did otherwise.

We agree with the district court that Bay Loan did not act in the manner which would bar recovery under the policy exclusion.  It is uncontroverted that Bay Loan relied on Marderosian to pay off the prior mortgage and believed that it would be paid off in the normal course.  It is also undisputed that Bay Loan intended that the proceeds from its loans be used to pay off the prior mortgages, and that its mortgages be the only encumbrances on the properties.

Furthermore, Bay Loan did not provide any instructions to or exert any control over Marderosian, and Bay Loan did not participate in the payment of Marderosian as closing attorney.  In addition, the record is unclear as to how Marderosian became the closing agent in the first place.  The district court found that Marderosian was not Bay Loan's agent.  \"Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.\"  American Title I, 959 F.2d at 346 (quoting Cumpiano v.

Only the first of these remained unknown prior to trial.

On appeal, American Title argues that the district court should have reached the merits of Bay Loan's damage claims with respect to all eighty units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Falmouth we held that a bank's claim for damages under a mortgagee's title insurance policy was premature because the amount of the loss was not \"definitely fixed.\"   The relevant provision, which also appears in Bay Loan's title policies, provides:  \"When liability has been definitely fixed in accordance with the conditions of this policy, the loss or damage shall be payable within 30 days thereafter.\"  (emphasis added).  In fact, there is no material difference between Bay Loan's policies and the policy construed in Falmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Falmouth, the insured brought an action against its title insurer for failure to pay a loss under a mortgagee's title insurance policy after liability had been determined against the insurer by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) in a related action.  The SJC remanded the case for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The insurance company moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim arguing that the bank's \"actual loss\" could not be determined until the state court determined the value of the property on remand.  The bank argued that liability was definitely fixed by the SJC's ruling, and that the insurance company was liable for the principal and accrued interest outstanding on the buyer's mortgage note.  The district court agreed with the insurance company, and we affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In affirming the dismissal, we construed the terms of the title insurance policy, focusing on the issue of when a loss is \"definitely fixed\" and payable to the insured.  We distinguished owner's title insurance policies, in which loss is measured by the decrease in market value caused by a title defect, and mortgagee's title policies in which a bank's loss equals the lesser of the decrease in market value of the bank's security caused by the title defect or the amount that is unrecoverable on the borrower's defaulted notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the mortgagee's policies at issue we held that \"a mortgagee-insured's loss cannot be determined unless the note is not repaid and the security for the mortgage proves inadequate....  Such is the case because it is only after the insurer or the insured sues on the note and the debtor fails to pay, that the actual loss can be determined.\"  Falmouth, 920 F.2d at 1063 (citations omitted).  The bank took the position that the insurer should be required to pay the outstanding principal, interest and late payments due on the debt, and subrogate to the bank's rights.  We rejected this argument because the insurance policy gave the insurer the option to either pay the bank's actual loss, or purchase the indebtedness and subrogate to the bank's rights against the mortgagors.  We held that to require the insurance company to pay the indebtedness before the \"actual loss\" is ascertained, \"would have the effect of amending the policy by making subrogation mandatory rather than optional.\"  Falmouth, 920 F.2d at 1063.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn our attention to the case at hand.  At the commencement of the second trial, Bay Loan took the position that because it had commenced suits against all the defaulting borrowers, it had satisfied the requirements of Falmouth at least with respect to some of the units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  American Title was of the opinion that Bay Loan would not be able to prove the fair market value of the individual units, but that even if it could, its claims were premature under Falmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court asked Bay Loan what the court should do if some but not all of the claims were premature under Falmouth, Bay Loan responded as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>I think that the appropriate relief in those circumstances if the Court rules that Falmouth does apply in part to this case, would be for the Court to make appropriate findings and conclusions which would be necessary as to those borrowers for whom we have fulfilled the requirements of Falmouth.   The same findings and conclusions would ultimately apply presumedly to the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Bay Loan added:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>About the measure of the recovery ... we contend that the measure of recovery is the fair market value of the condominiums at the time they were lost at the foreclosure of senior liens and we are prepared to prove what that value was.  If the Court finds that some other measure would be more appropriate or if the Court should disagree with our valuation and decide they were worth some different amount, you know, appropriate findings and conclusions could be made so that as litigation with other borrowers is resolved, either by judgments or by bankruptcies or however they get resolved, both Bay Loan and American Title would know what the other's rights are.  And I think that would be easy enough to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the trial progressed, it became clear that Bay Loan would not be able to prove the fair market value of the individual condominium units.  Sensing as much, at the close of the evidence Bay Loan admitted that its claims were premature under Falmouth.   American Title responded that, in order to put an end to this litigation, it would concede that the fair market value of each unit would always be less than the uncollectible debt owed by each defaulting borrower.  American Title reiterated this point in its closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After all was said and done, the district court held that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>the only reasonable reading of Falmouth is that a mortgagee must pursue legal action against a defaulting borrower until a reasonable lender would write off the debt as uncollectible or, to put it another way, until the anticipated cost of further proceedings against the borrower would be greater than any amount that is likely to be recovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 260.   It then found that Bay Loan had not reached this point on its claims.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title makes two principal arguments on appeal.  First, it maintains that Falmouth did not prevent the district court from reaching the merits of Bay Loan's claims since we have never \"held that suit against the borrower is required before a court may conclude that no actual loss has been sustained on a title policy, based upon the insured's failure to prove the other elements that are required to make a claim of damages.\"   Plaintiff-Appellant Brief at 42.  Alternatively, American Title contends that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the claims without prejudice because the Falmouth issue was \"mooted\" by its concession that the uncollectible balances due from borrowers would always exceed the value of the collateral.  Because American Title is assigning error to the district court's legal conclusion based upon its reading of Falmouth, our review is plenary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note first that this case proceeded in a manner wholly unlike Falmouth.   The present case was not decided through a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim made by the insurer.  In contrast, American Title advocated that the district court reach the merits of Bay Loan's claims.  Here, the insured's claims went to trial, and the insured was afforded a full and fair opportunity to prove the amounts by which its collateral was impaired by the prior mortgages.  In fact, as we noted above, at the commencement of the trial, Bay Loan explicitly stated that it planned to prove the fair market value of all the individual condominium units, even where its claim in connection with that unit was premature under Falmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As evidenced by its remarks at the outset of the trial, Bay Loan anticipated that the district court would make factual findings as to the fair market value of each unit, and that those findings would be binding, in the future, on claims that were still premature. Bay Loan made its position clear, put its best foot forward, and attempted to prove the fair market value of the individual units.  Furthermore, it is apparent that, long before American Title made its concession, Bay Loan recognized that the fair market value of each unit would, in all likelihood, be less than the uncollectible debt owed by the defaulting borrowers.  This is reflected in Bay Loan's statement that the fair market value of each unit would be \"the measure of [its] recovery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we believe that the district court committed reversible error by rigidly applying Falmouth to the present case, and failing to reach the merits of Bay Loan's claims.  Falmouth was not intended to afford an insured-mortgagee second and third opportunities to prove something that it had otherwise been unable to prove.  Once Bay Loan made its position clear and proceeded full steam ahead on all of its claims, it was incumbent upon the district court to adjudicate each claim on the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only with respect to the claim under the Kirschner policy did the district court reach the merits of Bay Loan's damages claim.  The court found that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bay Loan has been afforded every opportunity to prove the amount by which the value of its security in the Kirschner unit was diminished by the title defects.  Since it has failed to do so, its counterclaim for damages under the Kirschner policy is dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 261.   There is no indication in the record that Bay Loan's proof on the other units was, or would have been, different in any material respect from its proof on the Kirschner unit.  Bay Loan anticipated that the district court would find that it had proven the fair market value for each of the units, and that upon maturity of its claims, that value would be the measure of its recovery under the title policies.  Since Bay Loan has tried but did not prove this value for any of the units, it should have to bear the consequences of its failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short we rule that the district court misconstrued the scope of Falmouth and that Bay Loan was given every opportunity to prove damages but was unable to do so.  This is not a case where the district court foreclosed any avenues of proof.  There is no reason why Bay Loan should be granted a third opportunity to prove damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was another reason that compelled a dismissal with prejudice.  American Title maintains that it \"mooted\" the Falmouth issue, and that Bay Loan's claims were therefore ripe for adjudication on the merits.  This argument has merit.  Under the policies, the Falmouth requirements are conditions precedent to the insurance company's obligation to pay under the policies.  Where, as is the case here, the insurer agrees to waive one of the conditions, this waiver is effective, and the insurer becomes obligated to pay under the policy.  See generally Arthur L. Corbin, 3A Corbin on Contracts Sec. 753 (1972) (condition to party's duty to perform can be eliminated by a mere voluntary expression of party's willingness to waive it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as a practical matter, once American Title made its concession, Bay Loan's pending actions against the debtors became irrelevant to the damages calculation.  In other words, the resolution of those claims would not affect the amount of Bay Loan's recovery from American Title.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Falmouth does not require an insured to expend time, effort and money in actions to collect against defaulting borrowers as a prerequisite to establishing damages against the insurer, where those actions are wholly irrelevant to the measure of the insured's recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the district court should have reached the merits of Bay Loan's claims, and dismissed them with prejudice.  We reverse the district court's without prejudice dismissal of these claims.  Our disposition of the evidentiary issue raised on Bay Loan's appeal of the dismissal of the Kirschner claim would not alter this conclusion.  Because Bay Loan did not appeal from the district court's dismissal without prejudice of its claims, even if we were to reverse the challenged evidentiary ruling, only the Kirschner unit would enjoy the benefit of that ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. The Kirschner Unit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously indicated, the district court found that Bay Loan's claim under the title policy covering the Kirschner unit was not premature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  But, the court found that Bay Loan was unable to prove its damages on this claim, and therefore dismissed it with prejudice.  Bay Loan appeals this ruling primarily on the ground that the district court improperly excluded the testimony of its expert appraiser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bay Loan's title policy provides coverage for losses arising out of \"the priority of any lien or encumbrance over the lien of the insured mortgage.\"  (emphasis added).  Each insured mortgage at issue here corresponds to an individual condominium unit.  Accordingly, Bay Loan was required to prove its actual loss with respect to each individual condominium unit--in this case the Kirschner unit.  Bay Loan planned to do this by having an expert appraiser testify as to the fair market value of The Charlestown Motor Inn as an operating business.  See American Title II, 817 F.Supp. at 261.   American Title objected to the admission of this testimony on the ground that, without more, the value of the motel was not probative of the value of each individual condominium unit.  After allowing Bay Loan to make an offer of proof, the court sustained the objection.  The court later explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>Bay Loan did proffer evidence regarding the value of The Charlestown Motor Inn as an operating motel on the theory that the value of each individual unit is a proportionate share of that amount.  However, that approach ignores the fact that what American Title insured was title to and the validity of Bay Loan's mortgage liens on individual condominium units.  It did not insure the motels as going businesses or the value of individual units calculated as a percentage of the motel's value.  Those two values may differ just as the total value of ten residential lots comprising a city block may be considerably different from the value of those lots when combined to form one parcel of commercial real estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 261.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bay Loan argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the proposed testimony because it should be allowed to value the individual units by looking at the motel qua motel, since that represented the highest and best use for the units.  Bay Loan also argues that the value of the motel represented the best available evidence of the value of the individual units since the units could not be independently appraised.  We address these contentions seriatim keeping in mind that a district court's decision to exclude evidence is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.  Losacco v. F.D. Rich Constr.

Although it might be that the \"highest and best\" use for the individual condominium units would be as rooms in an operating motel, this is not what was insured.  As the district court pointed out, what was insured was \"title to and the validity of ... mortgage liens on individual condominium units.\"  Id.  While it is true that a number of these units were located in the same motel, the insurance was not issued on this basis and did not insure the condominium units as potential rooms in a motel.  We think the district court's \"city block\" analogy clearly illustrates the basic flaw in Bay Loan's approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Bay Loan maintains that the value of the motel is admissible as the \"best available evidence\" of the value of the individual condominium units.  Even though the \"proportionate share\" motel's value (i.e., the value of the motel divided by the number of individual condominium units), might be the best evidence of the value of each unit, it is not necessarily so.  See Allison v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544290\"><a href=\"/opinion/544290/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95343-john-d-allison-and-bayfield-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1990).  A given unit might be worth more or less than the value of the motel divided by the number of units.  It was Bay Loan's responsibility to introduce evidence as to the value of each unit so that the district court could make a determination of damages.  As the record plainly indicates, Bay Loan did not intend to offer any evidence which would connect its expert's opinion on the value of the entire motel, to the value of individual condominium units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Bay Loan's expert witness been prepared to testify that, although he could not directly appraise individual units, the proportionate value of the motel was relevant in determining the value of the units, we might be inclined to side with Bay Loan.  See Allison v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595230\"><a href=\"/opinion/595230/john-d-allison-bayfield-electric-cooperative-robert-e-cadwell-v-ticor/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1187</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1992) (holding that district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of lodge's value where value of individual units in the lodge was at issue, particularly where expert witness testified that he looked at the proportionate value of lodge in valuing the individual units).  Because this was not the case, we cannot see how the court's ruling amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bay Loan contends that notwithstanding the exclusion of this evidence, it still proved its damages with respect to the Kirschner unit.  We review the district court's determination of damages for clear error.  Soto v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658375\"><a href=\"/opinion/658375/elvin-h-soto-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[D]etermining damages ... falls within the sound judgment and discretion of the factfinder and will not be overridden without substantial cause.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only evidence offered by Bay Loan with respect to its damages on its claim under the Kirschner policy was the sale price received by the prior mortgagee when he foreclosed on seventeen of the thirty-three units in The Charlestown Motor Inn, one of which was the Kirschner unit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  What Bay Loan fails to realize is that the sale price obtained by the prior mortgagee at foreclosure represents the value of approximately one-half of the entire motel, not the value of seventeen individual condominium units.  In fact, the parties stipulated that the prior mortgage covering these seventeen units was not subject to the condominium declaration.  Because Bay Loan did not introduce any evidence of a correlation between the value of one-half the motel and the value of the Kirschner unit, we can find no error, clear or otherwise, in the district court's findings and ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment of the district court as to American Title's liability under the title insurance policies at issue here.  We also affirm the district court's dismissal with prejudice of Bay Loan's claim under the Kirschner policy.  We reverse the district court's dismissal without prejudice of Bay Loan's claims under the remaining policies.  Those claims are ordered dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No costs to either party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The convictions were, in large part, affirmed on appeal.

The seller was required to remit the purchase price with appropriate adjustments (e.g., passage of time and improvements on the land).

Here, Bay Loan has not advanced this argument, but has acknowledged that its measure of recovery is the fair market value of the individual units at the time the prior mortgagee foreclosed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In fact, Bay Loan could have realized a windfall as a result of this concession.  If Bay Loan had succeeded in proving the fair market value of a given unit, and subsequently recovered substantial sums from the corresponding debtor such that the fair market value of the unit exceeded the amount still owed by the debtor, then Bay Loan would have recovered more than it was entitled to recover under its title insurance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> With the consent of American Title, Bay Loan settled its claim against Kirschner for $15,000.
