Appellants Rhetta Sweeney, individually and\n                 \n\n  as trustee of the Maple Leaf Realty Trust and of the Canadian\n\n  Realty  Trust, and  John Sweeney  [the  Sweeneys] appeal  the\n\n  final judgment entered by the United States District Court of\n\n  the  District of Massachusetts for appellees Resolution Trust\n\n  Corporation  [RTC], in  its capacity  as  receiver of  ComFed\n\n  Savings  Bank,  ComFed  Mortgage  Company,  Inc.  and  Comfed\n\n  Advisory Company,  Inc. [collectively  \"ComFed\"], and  Dennis\n\n  Furey,  an  employee of  ComFed Mortgage  Company, Inc.   The\n\n  Sweeneys also appeal  the district court award to  the RTC of\n\n  attorneys'  fees incurred  in responding  to  what the  court\n\n  found a frivolous motion to remand.  We affirm.\n\n                            Background\n\n       In 1987,  the Sweeneys  borrowed $1,600,000  from ComFed\n\n  for construction  of single  family homes  and other work  on\n\n  their property in Hamilton, Massachusetts.  The obligation is\n\n  evidenced  by  a  promissory note,  a  loan  agreement  and a\n\n  construction loan agreement, all dated August  27, 1988.  The\n\n  Sweeneys  allege that  ComFed also  agreed  to an  additional\n\n  $900,000  in construction financing.   ComFed denies  that it\n\n  made  any agreement  as  to  a further  loan.   The  Sweeneys\n\n  defaulted on the note and, in November 1988, ComFed initiated\n\n  foreclosure proceedings.  \n\n       In April 1989, the Sweeneys filed a nine count complaint\n\n  in   Middlesex  Superior   Court  asserting   various  lender\n\n                               -3-\n\n  liability  claims against ComFed  and Furey.   ComFed filed a\n\n  counterclaim  seeking   a  determination  of   the  Sweeney's\n\n  liability to ComFed under the terms of the $1,600,000 note on\n\n  which the Sweeneys had allegedly defaulted.  In October 1989,\n\n  the superior court  issued an injunction barring  ComFed from\n\n  foreclosing on the Sweeney's mortgaged property.\n\n       In March  1990,  after a  twelve day  trial, a  superior\n\n  court  jury  returned  a   special  verdict  awarding  ComFed\n\n  $2,069,586.33  for  the  Sweeneys' breach  of  the  note, and\n\n  Rhetta   Sweeney  $65,000   for  intentional   infliction  of\n\n  emotional distress.  The court reserved to itself judgment on\n\n  two counts:  ComFed's alleged violation of Mass.  Gen. L. ch.\n\n  93A  and the  claim for  specific performance  of an  alleged\n\n  agreement by ComFed to a partial release of the mortgage.  \n\n       On  December 13, 1990, the RTC was appointed conservator\n\n  of Comfed and,  on January 11, 1991, removed the  case to the\n\n  United   States   District   Court   for   the  District   of\n\n  Massachusetts.1  No judgment had  yet been entered on the two\n\n  counts tried to the superior  court.  However, on January 30,\n\n  1991, the superior court purported to enter judgment on those\n\n  two counts.   The court purported to find for the Sweeneys on\n\n                      \n\n  1.  On January  31, 1991, the  RTC was appointed  receiver of\n  ComFed  and  conservator of  ComFed, F.A.   On  September 13,\n  1991, the RTC was appointed receiver of ComFed, F.A.  The RTC\n  as  receiver of ComFed  retains the liabilities  in this case\n  while the RTC as receiver of ComFed, S.A. retains the assets.\n  \"RTC\" as used in this opinion  refers to the RTC in both  its\n  roles.\n\n                               -4-\n\n  their  chapter 93A claim in the amount of $2,998,931.44, plus\n\n  interest  and costs,  and  attorneys' fees  of  $97,704.   No\n\n  copies or notices of this  opinion were mailed to the parties\n\n  by the court clerk.\n\n       On January 31, 1991, counsel  for the RTC learned of the\n\n  purported  opinion when  he went  to  the Middlesex  Superior\n\n  Court Clerk's office to transport  the record to the  federal\n\n  district court.2   Believing  the opinion  to  be a  nullity,\n\n  counsel contacted the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office\n\n  to urge  that the opinion  be withdrawn.  The  superior court\n\n  refused  to do  so and  instead released  the opinion  to the\n\n  Sweeneys  on February  25, 1991.   Counsel  for the  RTC then\n\n  filed  the opinion  with the  district court  under seal  and\n\n  moved to  expunge  it from  the  record.   On  March  1,  the\n\n  Sweeneys filed  a motion to  remand the case to  the superior\n\n  court   on  the  ground   that  the  district   court  lacked\n\n  jurisdiction.\n\n       After  a series  of  evidentiary hearings,  the district\n\n  court  determined that the  case had been  removed on January\n\n  11, 1991 and found that the Sweeneys' objection, which was in\n\n  the court's view an objection to venue not jurisdiction,  was\n\n  untimely.    On January  9,  1992,  the  RTC moved  that  the\n\n  district  court enter the superior court  jury verdict in its\n\n                      \n\n  2.   Testimony was  presented before the district  court that\n  this was in conformity with Middlesex Court practice.\n\n                               -5-\n\n  entirety and grant the RTC summary judgment on the two counts\n\n  which had been  tried to  the superior court.   On April  14,\n\n  1992, the district court entered the jury verdict and granted\n\n  summary  judgment to the RTC.   On April  27, 1992, the court\n\n  vacated  the superior court  injunction.  Final  judgment was\n\n  entered on  February 9, 1993.   On February 13,  1993, Rhetta\n\n  Sweeney, purporting to act on  behalf of all the  plaintiffs,\n\n  filed  a third  motion to  remand  the case  to the  superior\n\n  court.  Finding that the motion made no new factual  or legal\n\n  argument,  the  district  court  allowed  the RTC's  request,\n\n  pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.  P. 11, for attorneys' fees incurred\n\n  in responding to  this motion.  The Sweeneys  now appeal both\n\n  the final  order of  the court and  the grant  to the  RTC of\n\n  attorneys' fees.\n\n                           Discussion \n                           Discussion\n\n       The Sweeneys contend first that the district court erred\n\n  in  denying their  motion to  have the  case remanded  to the\n\n  superior  court.   According to  appellants,  removal to  the\n\n  United  States   District   Court   for   the   District   of\n\n  Massachusetts was  improper since  12 U.S.C.    1441(a)(l)(3)\n\n  allows for  removal only to the United  States District Court\n\n  for  the  District  of  Columbia.3   Construing  this  as  an\n\n                      \n\n  3.    At  the  time  of  appellants'  motion,     1441a(l)(3)\n  provided that venue was proper in:\n\n       the  United States District  Court for the District\n       of  Columbia, or if the action, suit, or proceeding\n\n                               -6-\n\n  objection to venue,  the district court denied the  motion on\n\n  the ground that it had been filed more than thirty days after\n\n  removal.  See 28 U.S.C.    1447(c).  The Sweeneys argue  that\n               \n\n  this period should have been tolled because of the RTC's \"bad\n\n  faith\" in  withholding  from  them  a copy  of  the  superior\n\n  court's  purported  judgment,  the  existence  of  which  the\n\n  Sweeneys discovered only on February 25, 1991.4\n\n       Even  if we  grant  arguendo that  venue  in the  United\n                                   \n\n  States District Court  for the District of  Massachusetts was\n\n  improper  pursuant  to   1441(a)(l)(3) and  that  appellants'\n\n  motion  is subject  to equitable  tolling, we  still find  no\n\n  error in the district court's denial of appellants' motion to\n\n  remand.  28 U.S.C.   1441(a) provides that \n\n                      \n\n       arises out of  the actions of the  Corporation with\n       respect to  an institution for which  a conservator\n       or a receiver has been appointed, the United States\n       district   court  for   the   district  where   the\n       institution's principal business is located.\n\n  Since this  suit did  not arise  \"out of  the actions  of the\n  Corporation,\"  venue was  proper only  in  the United  States\n  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia.    Section\n  1441a(l)(3)  was amended effective  February 1, 1992.   Under\n  the  amended section, venue would be proper in Massachusetts.\n  We express no opinion as  to whether this amendment should be\n  applied retroactively.\n\n  4.  The  Sweeneys  appear   to  concede  that  12   U.S.C.   \n  1441a(l)(3) is a venue not  a jurisdictional statute.  See In\n                                                               \n  re 5300 Memorial  Investors, Ltd., 973  F.2d 1160, 1163  (5th\n                                  \n  Cir. 1992) (federal  courts \"consistently have  construed the\n  former provision in  section 1441a(l)(3) . . .  as concerning\n  solely venue and  not jurisdiction\").  The district court had\n  jurisdiction  over  this  action  pursuant  to  12  U.S.C.   \n  1441a(l)(1).\n\n                               -7-\n\n       [e]xcept as otherwise expressly  provided by Act of\n                                      \n\n       Congress, any civil action brought in a State court\n\n       of which the  district courts of the  United States\n\n       have original jurisdiction may be  removed . . . to\n\n       the district  court of  the United  States for  the\n\n       district  and  division embracing  the  place where\n\n       such action is pending. (emphasis added)\n\nSince nothing  in 12 U.S.C.   1441a(l)(3) expressly limits venue,\n\nthe general venue provision of  28 U.S.C.   1441(a) is applicable\n\nto this case.  See Hellon &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Phoenix Resort Corp.,\n                                                               \n\n958 F.2d 295, 298 (9th Cir. 1992) (removal proper under   1441(a)\n\nsince \"[n]othing  in the statutory language provides  that RTC is\n\nlimited  to the  specific  removal  provision  found  in  section\n\n1441a(l)(3)\");  Resolution Trust Corp. v.

Given that the RTC removed this case to the district\n\ncourt of  the United States  where the action was  pending, venue\n\nwas proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1441(a) and appellants' motion\n\nto remand was properly denied.\n\n       The Sweeneys next contend that the district court erred in\n\nnot  entering the  purported judgment  of the  superior court  in\n\ntheir favor.  However, the district court supportably  found that\n\nthis case had been  removed to the federal  court on January  11,\n\n1991.   \"At  that  point,  the jurisdiction  of  the state  court\n\n                               -8-\n\n'absolutely ceased, and  that of the [federal  court] immediately\n\nattached,'\"  Hyde Park Partners.

Federal Deposit\n                                                                 \n\nIns.

Mass.  Gen. L.  c. 93A    2  protects against  \"unfair or\n  deceptive acts  or practices in  the conduct of any  trade or\n  commerce.\"\n\n                               -9-\n\nto  the  $1,600,000   loan  actually  provided.     According  to\n\nappellants, ComFed knew that without the additional financing the\n\nSweeneys would be forced to default on the original agreement, as\n\nin fact happened.  \n\n       The D'Oench doctrine  applies to the RTC when  it acts, as\n                  \n\nin the instant case, in its capacity as receiver, see 12 U.S.C.  \n                                                     \n\n1441a(b)(4)(A), and  extends to  the financial  interests of  any\n\nwholly owned subsidiaries of a failed institution,  see Oliver v.\n                                                              \n\nResolution  Trust  Corp., 955  F.2d 583,  585-86 (8th  Cir. 1992)\n                       \n\n(citing  cases).6  It  bars affirmative claims,  whether sounding\n\nin  contract or  tort, when  they  are premised  on an  unwritten\n\nagreement.

To satisfy\n   \n\nthe strictures of  D'Oench and   1823(e) appellants  must show an\n                          \n\nagreement in writing  to provide the additional loans.   The mere\n\nfact that  the appellants  relied in good  faith on  an unwritten\n\nagreement is not enough.  Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v.

Rather,\n\nthey  claim  that  they \"reasonably  understood\"  ComFed  to have\n\ncommitted itself to  such financing based on the  language of the\n\nagreements.

However, they  are insufficient to  establish an\n\nobligation  on   the  part  of   ComFed  which  would   meet  the\n\nrequirements  of D'Oench.

This provision\n\n                      \n\n  7.   The Sweeneys rely (1) on a clause  of the loan agreement\n  which  requires them  to pay a  \"1% nonuse  fee in  the event\n  COMFED does not  finance the development and  construction of\n  the 7  plus/minus additional  lots;\" (2) on  a clause  in the\n  construction loan  agreement which  states  that the  \"Lender\n  shall no[] longer  be bound by this  Agreement . . .  if said\n  building or buildings and improvements shall not be completed\n  on or  before twelve  (12) months from  the date  hereof, but\n  Lender may advance payments but  shall not be bound to  do so\n  after  the date for said completion;\" and  (3) on a clause in\n  the  construction loan agreement which gave ComFed \"the right\n  to  withhold 10% of the final  advance until forty-three (43)\n  days .  . . after  the full completion of  the construction.\"\n  Neither the references  to possible future financing  nor the\n  references   to  the   project's   completion  establish   an\n  obligation on the part of ComFed to fund the entire project.\n\n                               -11-\n\nrequires,  in relevant part,  that a federal  savings association\n\nmay  not  make a  real estate  loan  if the  loan  \"exceed[s] the\n\napplicable maximum loan-to-value ratio limitations prescribed [by\n\nthe   association's  board   of  directors].\"      12  C.F.R.    \n\n545.32(d)(4).

While\n                             \n\nviolations  of certain  federal consumer protection  statutes may\n\ncome within  the purview of chapter 93A    2,9 12 C.F.R.   545.32\n\nis not a  consumer protection statute but a  \"means of protecting\n\ninsured  depositors,  the  [FDIC] fund,  and  ultimately  federal\n\ntaxpayers.\"   Saratoga Sav.  &amp; Loan Ass'n.  v.

The district  court,\n\nrelying on  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  63,   entered judgment  on all  the\n\nclaims  which had  been  tried to  the jury  in  the state  court\n\naction.11   The Sweeneys do  not contend that the  district court\n\nwas without  authority to  so enter the  judgment.   Instead they\n\nassert  that  they  suffered  prejudice from  the  entry  of  the\n\nverdict.  See  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 63.   They argue  that they  were\n             \n\nprejudiced first because the jury verdict was clearly against the\n\nweight of the evidence.  The Sweeneys also contend that the entry\n\nof the verdict  prejudiced them because  the parties had  agreed,\n\nprior to the superior court trial, that the jury claims and those\n\n                      \n\n  10.   Since the Sweeneys  make only passing reference to  the\n  grant  of  summary  judgment  on  their  claim  for  specific\n  performance,  any objection to this judgment has been waived.\n  See Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990)\n                           \n  (issue  referred to  in  perfunctory  manner  on  appeal  and\n  without developed argumentation deemed waived).\n\n  11.  Rule 63 provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n            If a trial  or hearing has been  commenced and\n       the judge is unable to proceed, any other judge may\n       proceed with  it upon  certifying familiarity  with\n       the  record and determining that the proceedings in\n       the  case may be completed without prejudice to the\n       parties.\n\n                               -13-\n\npresented to the  court would be tried  on the same set  of facts\n\nsimultaneously.  Therefore, the district court should either have\n\nentered both  the jury  verdict and the  state court  judgment or\n\ngranted a new trial on all counts. \n\n       We find  no prejudice from  the court's entry of  the jury\n\nverdicts.  As to the first argument, the Sweeneys are entitled to\n\nhave the jury verdict set aside only if they demonstrate that the\n\nverdict  was a  \"manifest miscarriage  of justice.\"12   Milone v.\n                                                              \n\nMoceri  Family, Inc.,  847 F.3d  35, 37  (1st Cir.  1988) (citing\n                   \n\ncases).  The Sweeneys have failed to meet this exacting standard.\n\nAs to the second, the jury reached  its verdict after hearing the\n\nfacts  presented at  trial; summary judgment  was granted  by the\n\ndistrict court to the RTC as a matter of law and on  the basis of\n\nfederal  defenses which  arose only  after  the trial.   In  such\n\ncircumstances, appellants suffered no  prejudice from the failure\n\nto try both sets of claims simultaneously to the judge and jury.\n\n       The  remaining substantive claims  raised by  the Sweeneys\n\nmerit  only brief  responses.   Since the  opinion issued  by the\n\nsuperior court on January 31, 1991,  was void ab initio, there is\n                                                       \n\nno basis  for entering it  nunc pro tunc.   For the  same reason,\n                                        \n\n                      \n\n  12.  The Sweeneys moved for a new trial in the state court on\n  the ground  that the jury  verdict was against the  weight of\n  the evidence.  This motion  was not acted upon before removal\n  and,  therefore,  was  arguably pending  before  the district\n  court.   The district court,  however, made no ruling  on the\n  motion.  \n\n                               -14-\n\nthat  opinion cannot affect the propriety of the district court's\n\nentrance of the jury verdict.  \n\n       The RTC did not engage in impermissible forum shopping  in\n\nremoving  this  action  to  the  federal  court.    12  U.S.C.   \n\n1441a(l)(3)(A) allows the RTC to remove an action brought against\n\nit  in its  capacity  as receiver  even while  a state  appeal is\n\npending.

[collectively \"ComFed\"], and Dennis Furey, an employee of ComFed Mortgage Company, Inc.  The Sweeneys also appeal the district court award to the RTC of attorneys' fees incurred in responding to what the court found a frivolous motion to remand.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, the Sweeneys borrowed $1,600,000 from ComFed for construction of single family homes and other work on their property in Hamilton, Massachusetts.  The obligation is evidenced by a promissory note, a loan agreement and a construction loan agreement, all dated August 27, 1988.  The Sweeneys allege that ComFed also agreed to an additional $900,000 in construction financing.  ComFed denies that it made any agreement as to a further loan.  The Sweeneys defaulted on the note and, in November 1988, ComFed initiated foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1989, the Sweeneys filed a nine count complaint in Middlesex Superior Court asserting various lender liability claims against ComFed and Furey.  ComFed filed a counterclaim seeking a determination of the Sweeney's liability to ComFed under the terms of the $1,600,000 note on which the Sweeneys had allegedly defaulted.  In October 1989, the superior court issued an injunction barring ComFed from foreclosing on the Sweeney's mortgaged property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1990, after a twelve day trial, a superior court jury returned a special verdict awarding ComFed $2,069,586.33 for the Sweeneys' breach of the note, and Rhetta Sweeney $65,000 for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The court reserved to itself judgment on two counts:  ComFed's alleged violation of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A and the claim for specific performance of an alleged agreement by ComFed to a partial release of the mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 13, 1990, the RTC was appointed conservator of Comfed and, on January 11, 1991, removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  No judgment had yet been entered on the two counts tried to the superior court.  However, on January 30, 1991, the superior court purported to enter judgment on those two counts.  The court purported to find for the Sweeneys on their chapter 93A claim in the amount of $2,998,931.44, plus interest and costs, and attorneys' fees of $97,704.  No copies or notices of this opinion were mailed to the parties by the court clerk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 31, 1991, counsel for the RTC learned of the purported opinion when he went to the Middlesex Superior Court Clerk's office to transport the record to the federal district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Believing the opinion to be a nullity, counsel contacted the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office to urge that the opinion be withdrawn.  The superior court refused to do so and instead released the opinion to the Sweeneys on February 25, 1991.  Counsel for the RTC then filed the opinion with the district court under seal and moved to expunge it from the record.  On March 1, the Sweeneys filed a motion to remand the case to the superior court on the ground that the district court lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a series of evidentiary hearings, the district court determined that the case had been removed on January 11, 1991 and found that the Sweeneys' objection, which was in the court's view an objection to venue not jurisdiction, was untimely.  On January 9, 1992, the RTC moved that the district court enter the superior court jury verdict in its entirety and grant the RTC summary judgment on the two counts which had been tried to the superior court.  On April 14, 1992, the district court entered the jury verdict and granted summary judgment to the RTC.  On April 27, 1992, the court vacated the superior court injunction.  Final judgment was entered on February 9, 1993.  On February 13, 1993, Rhetta Sweeney, purporting to act on behalf of all the plaintiffs, filed a third motion to remand the case to the superior court.  Finding that the motion made no new factual or legal argument, the district court allowed the RTC's request, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, for attorneys' fees incurred in responding to this motion.  The Sweeneys now appeal both the final order of the court and the grant to the RTC of attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sweeneys contend first that the district court erred in denying their motion to have the case remanded to the superior court.  According to appellants, removal to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts was improper since 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1441a(l )(3) allows for removal only to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Construing this as an objection to venue, the district court denied the motion on the ground that it had been filed more than thirty days after removal.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1447(c).  The Sweeneys argue that this period should have been tolled because of the RTC's \"bad faith\" in withholding from them a copy of the superior court's purported judgment, the existence of which the Sweeneys discovered only on February 25, 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we grant arguendo that venue in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts was improper pursuant to Sec. 1441a(l )(3) and that appellants' motion is subject to equitable tolling, we still find no error in the district court's denial of appellants' motion to remand.  28 U.S.C. Sec. 1441(a) provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction may be removed ... to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.  (emphasis added)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since nothing in 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1441a(l )(3) expressly limits venue, the general venue provision of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1441(a) is applicable to this case.  See Hellon &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Phoenix Resort Corp., 958 F.2d 295, 298 (9th Cir.1992) (removal proper under Sec. 1441(a) since \"[n]othing in the statutory language provides that RTC is limited to the specific removal provision found in section 1441a(l)(3)\");  Resolution Trust Corp. v. Lightfoot, 938 F.2d 65, 68 (7th Cir.1991) (finding removal provision of 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1441a(l )(3) \"to supplement, rather than to replace, those of Sec. 1441(a)\").  Given that the RTC removed this case to the district court of the United States where the action was pending, venue was proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1441(a) and appellants' motion to remand was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sweeneys next contend that the district court erred in not entering the purported judgment of the superior court in their favor.  However, the district court supportably found that this case had been removed to the federal court on January 11, 1991.  \"At that point, the jurisdiction of the state court 'absolutely ceased, and that of the [federal court] immediately attached,' \" Hyde Park Partners, L.P. v. Connolly, 839 F.2d 837, 841 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting Steamship Co. v. Tugman, 106 U.S.  (16 Otto) 118, 122, 27 L.Ed. 87 (1882)), and the state court was under an obligation to \"proceed no further unless and until the case [wa]s remanded,\" 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1446(e);  see also Tugman, 106 U.S.  (16 Otto) at 122 (once case removed, state court had \"duty ... to proceed no further\").  Consequently, the purported judgment of the state court was \"void ab initio,\" Hyde Park Partners, 839 F.2d at 842, and the district court committed no error in refusing to enter judgment in accord with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sweeneys' third contention is that the district court improperly granted summary judgment to the RTC on the Sweeneys' claim under chapter 93A Sec. 2(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Appellants argue that the district court erred when it found that their claim relied on alleged promises not in writing and hence was barred by the doctrine enunciated in D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 315 U.S. 447, 62 S.Ct. 676, 86 L.Ed. 956 (1942) and codified at 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sweeneys' principal claim under chapter 93A is that the closing loan documents were \"misleading, oppressive, and unconscionable\" in that they led the Sweeneys to understand that ComFed would provide them with construction financing in addition to the $1,600,000 loan actually provided.  According to appellants, ComFed knew that without the additional financing the Sweeneys would be forced to default on the original agreement, as in fact happened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The D'Oench doctrine applies to the RTC when it acts, as in the instant case, in its capacity as receiver, see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1441a(b)(4)(A), and extends to the financial interests of any wholly owned subsidiaries of a failed institution, see Oliver v. Resolution Trust Corp., 955 F.2d 583, 585-86 (8th Cir.1992) (citing cases).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  It bars affirmative claims, whether sounding in contract or tort, when they are premised on an unwritten agreement.  Timberland Design, Inc. v. First Service Bank for Sav., 932 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir.1991) (citing cases).  To satisfy the strictures of D'Oench and Sec. 1823(e) appellants must show an agreement in writing to provide the additional loans.  The mere fact that the appellants relied in good faith on an unwritten agreement is not enough.  Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Caporale, 931 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the Sweeneys have identified no written provision of any loan document which explicitly states that such additional financing would be forthcoming.  Rather, they claim that they \"reasonably understood\" ComFed to have committed itself to such financing based on the language of the agreements.  Yet, the only provisions which they cite in support of this position are far too ambiguous, absent extraneous support, to establish an agreement to fund further construction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  At most, they reflect an intention to provide further funds.  However, they are insufficient to establish an obligation on the part of ComFed which would meet the requirements of D'Oench.   See, e.g., Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v. Two Rivers Assoc., Inc., 880 F.2d 1267, 1276 (11th Cir.1989) (requirements of D'Oench not met where written provisions reflect only intent to loan additional funds but not obligation to do so);  Beighley v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 868 F.2d 776, 783 (5th Cir.1989) (even though one might derive inference from documents that bank would cooperate in attempt to sell property, requirements of Sec. 1823(e) not met since \"not a single document states in writing\" that bank agreed to finance buyer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sweeneys also seek to base their chapter 93A claim on ComFed's alleged violation of 12 C.F.R. Sec. 545.32.  This provision requires, in relevant part, that a federal savings association may not make a real estate loan if the loan \"exceed[s] the applicable maximum loan-to-value ratio limitations prescribed [by the association's board of directors].\"  12 C.F.R. Sec. 545.32(d)(4).  According to appellants, the $1,600,000 loan they received was more than the 75% loan to value ratio established by the Board of Directors of ComFed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the loan granted the Sweeneys violated ComFed's own limitation, and hence 12 C.F.R. Sec. 545.32, we are aware of no authority which would indicate that this violation would be, as appellants assert, a \"per se violation\" of chapter 93A.  While violations of certain federal consumer protection statutes may come within the purview of chapter 93A Sec. 2,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> 12 C.F.R. Sec. 545.32 is not a consumer protection statute but a \"means of protecting insured depositors, the [FDIC] fund, and ultimately federal taxpayers.\"  Saratoga Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n. v. Federal Home Loan Bank Bd., 879 F.2d 689, 693 (9th Cir.1989).  We are aware of no authority supporting the claim that an alleged violation of Sec. 545.32 suffices to state a cause of action under chapter 93A.  The district court did not err in granting the RTC summary judgment on the chapter 93A claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sweeneys also assert that, if the case is not remanded, they are entitled to a new trial in federal court on the claims decided by the jury in the state action and entered by the federal district court after removal. The district court, relying on Fed.R.Civ.P. 63, entered judgment on all the claims which had been tried to the jury in the state court action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The Sweeneys do not contend that the district court was without authority to so enter the judgment.  Instead they assert that they suffered prejudice from the entry of the verdict.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 63.  They argue that they were prejudiced first because the jury verdict was clearly against the weight of the evidence.  The Sweeneys also contend that the entry of the verdict prejudiced them because the parties had agreed, prior to the superior court trial, that the jury claims and those presented to the court would be tried on the same set of facts simultaneously.  Therefore, the district court should either have entered both the jury verdict and the state court judgment or granted a new trial on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no prejudice from the court's entry of the jury verdicts.  As to the first argument, the Sweeneys are entitled to have the jury verdict set aside only if they demonstrate that the verdict was a \"manifest miscarriage of justice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Milone v. Moceri Family, Inc., 847 F.3d 35, 37 (1st Cir.1988) (citing cases).  The Sweeneys have failed to meet this exacting standard.  As to the second, the jury reached its verdict after hearing the facts presented at trial;  summary judgment was granted by the district court to the RTC as a matter of law and on the basis of federal defenses which arose only after the trial.  In such circumstances, appellants suffered no prejudice from the failure to try both sets of claims simultaneously to the judge and jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining substantive claims raised by the Sweeneys merit only brief responses.  Since the opinion issued by the superior court on January 31, 1991, was void ab initio, there is no basis for entering it nunc pro tunc.   For the same reason, that opinion cannot affect the propriety of the district court's entrance of the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RTC did not engage in impermissible forum shopping in removing this action to the federal court.  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1441a(l )(3)(A) allows the RTC to remove an action brought against it in its capacity as receiver even while a state appeal is pending.  Resolution Trust Corp. v. Nernberg, 3 F.3d 62, 68 (3d Cir.1993);  Lester v. Resolution Trust Corp., 994 F.2d 1247, 1251-52 (7th Cir.1993);  In re 5300 Memorial Investors, Ltd., 973 F.2d 1160, 1162 (5th Cir.1992);  see also, Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Keating, 12 F.3d 314, 316 (1st Cir.1993) (12 U.S.C. Sec. 1819(b)(2), the removal statute for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, identical in relevant part to the RTC removal provision, allows removal while state appeal is pending).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sweeneys have failed to make a showing that they have discovered new evidence relating to the issues tried to the superior court jury which would be \"of such nature that it would probably change the result if a new trial is granted.\"  Nickerson v. G.D. Searle and Co., 900 F.2d 412, 417 (1st Cir.1990).  The only evidence they have adduced does not appear related to actions which form the basis of their complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sweeneys' request for an injunction preventing the RTC from foreclosing on the real property securing their $1.6 million dollar note is barred by 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(j).  See Telematics Int'l, Inc. v. NEMLC Leasing Corp., 967 F.2d 703, 707 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the other contentions raised by the Sweeneys as to the disposition of their claims possesses any merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Sweeneys appeal the grant by the district court, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, of the RTC's request for attorneys' fees incurred in responding to appellants' third motion to remand the case to the superior court.  The district court previously denied two almost identical motions and had made detailed findings of fact as to both the date of the removal and the RTC's right to remove.  The court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions for this repetitive motion.  See Mariani v. Doctors Assoc., Inc., 983 F.2d 5, 7-8 (1st Cir.1993) (affirming imposition of Rule 11 sanction for filing of second motion which \"consisted of virtually verbatim argumentation\" from a prior motion on which appellants had not prevailed).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

[collectively \"ComFed\"], and Dennis Furey, an employee of ComFed Mortgage Company, Inc.  The Sweeneys also appeal the district court award to the RTC of attorneys' fees incurred in responding to what the court found a frivolous motion to remand.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, the Sweeneys borrowed $1,600,000 from ComFed for construction of single family homes and other work on their property in Hamilton, Massachusetts.  The obligation is evidenced by a promissory note, a loan agreement and a construction loan agreement, all dated August 27, 1988.  The Sweeneys allege that ComFed also agreed to an additional $900,000 in construction financing.  ComFed denies that it made any agreement as to a further loan.  The Sweeneys defaulted on the note and, in November 1988, ComFed initiated foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1989, the Sweeneys filed a nine count complaint in Middlesex Superior Court asserting various lender liability claims against ComFed and Furey.  ComFed filed a counterclaim seeking a determination of the Sweeney's liability to ComFed under the terms of the $1,600,000 note on which the Sweeneys had allegedly defaulted.  In October 1989, the superior court issued an injunction barring ComFed from foreclosing on the Sweeney's mortgaged property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1990, after a twelve day trial, a superior court jury returned a special verdict awarding ComFed $2,069,586.33 for the Sweeneys' breach of the note, and Rhetta Sweeney $65,000 for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The court reserved to itself judgment on two counts:  ComFed's alleged violation of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A and the claim for specific performance of an alleged agreement by ComFed to a partial release of the mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 13, 1990, the RTC was appointed conservator of Comfed and, on January 11, 1991, removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  No judgment had yet been entered on the two counts tried to the superior court.  However, on January 30, 1991, the superior court purported to enter judgment on those two counts.  The court purported to find for the Sweeneys on their chapter 93A claim in the amount of $2,998,931.44, plus interest and costs, and attorneys' fees of $97,704.  No copies or notices of this opinion were mailed to the parties by the court clerk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 31, 1991, counsel for the RTC learned of the purported opinion when he went to the Middlesex Superior Court Clerk's office to transport the record to the federal district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Believing the opinion to be a nullity, counsel contacted the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office to urge that the opinion be withdrawn.  The superior court refused to do so and instead released the opinion to the Sweeneys on February 25, 1991.  Counsel for the RTC then filed the opinion with the district court under seal and moved to expunge it from the record.  On March 1, the Sweeneys filed a motion to remand the case to the superior court on the ground that the district court lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a series of evidentiary hearings, the district court determined that the case had been removed on January 11, 1991 and found that the Sweeneys' objection, which was in the court's view an objection to venue not jurisdiction, was untimely.  On January 9, 1992, the RTC moved that the district court enter the superior court jury verdict in its entirety and grant the RTC summary judgment on the two counts which had been tried to the superior court.  On April 14, 1992, the district court entered the jury verdict and granted summary judgment to the RTC.  On April 27, 1992, the court vacated the superior court injunction.  Final judgment was entered on February 9, 1993.  On February 13, 1993, Rhetta Sweeney, purporting to act on behalf of all the plaintiffs, filed a third motion to remand the case to the superior court.  Finding that the motion made no new factual or legal argument, the district court allowed the RTC's request, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, for attorneys' fees incurred in responding to this motion.  The Sweeneys now appeal both the final order of the court and the grant to the RTC of attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sweeneys contend first that the district court erred in denying their motion to have the case remanded to the superior court.  According to appellants, removal to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts was improper since 12 U.S.C.

To satisfy the strictures of D'Oench and Sec. 1823(e) appellants must show an agreement in writing to provide the additional loans.

Rather, they claim that they \"reasonably understood\" ComFed to have committed itself to such financing based on the language of the agreements.  Yet, the only provisions which they cite in support of this position are far too ambiguous, absent extraneous support, to establish an agreement to fund further construction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  At most, they reflect an intention to provide further funds.  However, they are insufficient to establish an obligation on the part of ComFed which would meet the requirements of D'Oench.   See, e.g., Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v.

Sec. 545.32.  This provision requires, in relevant part, that a federal savings association may not make a real estate loan if the loan \"exceed[s] the applicable maximum loan-to-value ratio limitations prescribed [by the association's board of directors].\"  12 C.F.R. Sec. 545.32(d)(4).  According to appellants, the $1,600,000 loan they received was more than the 75% loan to value ratio established by the Board of Directors of ComFed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the loan granted the Sweeneys violated ComFed's own limitation, and hence 12 C.F.R. Sec. 545.32, we are aware of no authority which would indicate that this violation would be, as appellants assert, a \"per se violation\" of chapter 93A.  While violations of certain federal consumer protection statutes may come within the purview of chapter 93A Sec. 2,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> 12 C.F.R. Sec. 545.32 is not a consumer protection statute but a \"means of protecting insured depositors, the [FDIC] fund, and ultimately federal taxpayers.\"  Saratoga Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n. v.

We are aware of no authority supporting the claim that an alleged violation of Sec. 545.32 suffices to state a cause of action under chapter 93A.  The district court did not err in granting the RTC summary judgment on the chapter 93A claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sweeneys also assert that, if the case is not remanded, they are entitled to a new trial in federal court on the claims decided by the jury in the state action and entered by the federal district court after removal. The district court, relying on Fed.R.Civ.P. 63, entered judgment on all the claims which had been tried to the jury in the state court action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The Sweeneys do not contend that the district court was without authority to so enter the judgment.  Instead they assert that they suffered prejudice from the entry of the verdict.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 63.  They argue that they were prejudiced first because the jury verdict was clearly against the weight of the evidence.  The Sweeneys also contend that the entry of the verdict prejudiced them because the parties had agreed, prior to the superior court trial, that the jury claims and those presented to the court would be tried on the same set of facts simultaneously.  Therefore, the district court should either have entered both the jury verdict and the state court judgment or granted a new trial on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no prejudice from the court's entry of the jury verdicts.  As to the first argument, the Sweeneys are entitled to have the jury verdict set aside only if they demonstrate that the verdict was a \"manifest miscarriage of justice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Milone v.

The Sweeneys have failed to meet this exacting standard.  As to the second, the jury reached its verdict after hearing the facts presented at trial;  summary judgment was granted by the district court to the RTC as a matter of law and on the basis of federal defenses which arose only after the trial.  In such circumstances, appellants suffered no prejudice from the failure to try both sets of claims simultaneously to the judge and jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining substantive claims raised by the Sweeneys merit only brief responses.  Since the opinion issued by the superior court on January 31, 1991, was void ab initio, there is no basis for entering it nunc pro tunc.   For the same reason, that opinion cannot affect the propriety of the district court's entrance of the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RTC did not engage in impermissible forum shopping in removing this action to the federal court.  12 U.S.C.
