At trial,\n\nappellant, both at the end of the presentation of the\n\ngovernment's evidence and again after the jury reached its\n\nverdict, moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCrim P. 29(c) arguing that evidence of pretrial photographic\n\nidentifications should have been suppressed at trial since the\n\nidentifications were either obtained as the fruit of an illegal\n\narrest or were so suggestive so as to violate appellant's due\n\nprocess right.  The district court denied appellant's motion\n\nbecause of appellant's failure to bring his suppression motion\n\nbefore trial as required by Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3) and (f). \n\nThe district court further ruled that the pretrial identification\n\nprocedures did not violate appellant's due process rights.

Background  \n\n       On July 21, 1991, the vessel Eurocolombia arrived in\n\nPuerto Rico at the Ponce municipal pier around 7:00 P.M.1  The\n\nEurocolombia had been under investigation by the United States\n\nCustoms Service (\"Customs\") for eight to nine months.  As part of\n\nan on-going investigation by Customs into narcotics smuggling at\n\nthe municipal pier in Ponce, Customs enforcement personnel were\n\nin the practice of using confidential informants to provide\n\ninformation regarding  narcotics transactions.  One such\n\nconfidential informant, a seaman aboard the Eurocolombia,\n\nsignalled Customs personnel that contraband was on board the ship\n\non this particular night.  After seeing the signal, Customs Agent\n\nJose Ruiz boarded the Eurocolombia and contacted the confidential\n\ninformant.  \n\n       The confidential informant showed agent Ruiz a locker\n\nwhere a Colombian national named Alfonso had placed five one-kilo\n\npackages of cocaine while the Eurocolombia was in port in\n\nColombia.  Alfonso had given the confidential informant two\n\ntelephone numbers and instructed the confidential informant to\n\ncall the phone numbers when he arrived in Ponce, ask for \"Pepe\"\n\nor \"Jose\", and arrange for the exchange of the drugs.  Although\n\n                    \n\n1Evidence  was presented  at trial  that this  vessel arrives  in\nPonce just about every ten days.     \n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\ninitially frustrated by an out-of-order dockside phone, the\n\nconfidential informant eventually reached the Puerto Rico\n\ncontacts around 11:00 P.M. using agent Ruiz's cellular phone.\n\nAfter a series of phone calls, the confidential informant was\n\ninstructed to meet \"Jose\" and a friend, who would be waiting in a\n\nred Toyota four-by-four vehicle, at the Ponce pier gate to make\n\nthe exchange.  Agent Ruiz already had arranged for surveillance\n\nunits to be placed in and around the municipal pier area.      \n\n       The confidential informant taped the five kilos of cocaine\n\nto his body and walked from the vessel, out of the pier area, and\n\nonto Comercio Avenue where he made contact with the red Toyota. \n\nUpon entering the vehicle, he found \"Jose\" in the driver's seat\n\nand appellant in the front passenger seat.  The vehicle moved to\n\na nearby cash-and-carry where they exchanged $10,000 for the\n\ncocaine.  After the exchange, the confidential informant exited\n\nthe vehicle, noted its license plate number, and returned to the\n\nship.  At this point, the confidential informant had given no\n\ndescription of the occupants of the Toyota to Customs personnel.  \n\n       After the confidential informant left the Toyota, the\n\nCustoms enforcement operation unravelled.  Customs surveillance\n\nunits were supposed to stop the vehicle after the transaction was\n\ncompleted.  The red Toyota, however, sped away from the area\n\nbefore Customs agents had an opportunity to detain it.  The\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\noccupants of the Toyota led agent Ruiz and other Customs agents\n\non a high-speed chase through Ponce which ended in the town of\n\nSanta Isabel. \n\n       Although agent Ruiz testified that the Customs agents\n\nnever lost sight of the Toyota, other evidence contradicts his\n\ntestimony.  Apparently, at around 4:30 A.M., Customs agents\n\ndiscovered the abandoned Toyota, which had glanced off a\n\ntelephone pole and had smashed into the wall of a funeral home\n\nnear the entrance to Santa Isabel.  A search of the vehicle\n\nturned up $15.90 in cash, two cellular phones, a revolver\n\nholster, and a one-kilo package which field-tested positive for\n\ncocaine.  Witnesses at the scene told agent Ruiz and Carlos Ruiz,\n\nanother Customs agent, that the two occupants of the red Toyota\n\nfled the vehicle and headed toward town. \n\n       While at the scene investigating the car accident, Puerto\n\nRico police officer Juan de Leon received a local police radio\n\nreport of a person acting strangely at a local bar-restaurant\n\nabout half a kilometer from the accident scene.  Agent Ruiz and\n\nofficer de Leon went to the bar where the bar owner told them\n\nthat a certain stranger appeared nervous and was shaking.  The\n\nnervous stranger was later identified as appellant Miguel Gomez. \n\n       At this point, the officers still had no description of\n\nthe Toyota's occupants.  Appellant did not appear injured and no\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nother evidence linked him to the accident vehicle.  Nevertheless,\n\nbased on the suspect's nervousness and the fact that he was a\n\nstranger, appellant was placed under arrest at around 5:15 A.M.\n\nand was taken first to the scene of the accident and then to the\n\nCustoms enforcement office in Ponce.     \n\n       Following defendant's arrest, two Customs officials\n\nquestioned the confidential informant aboard the Eurocolombia. \n\nFirst, Customs official Manuel Zurita boarded the vessel and\n\nobtained a description of the two occupants of the Toyota from\n\nthe confidential informant.  The confidential informant testified\n\nat trial that Zurita's visit took place between 6:00 and 6:30\n\nA.M..  Shortly after the first visit, agent Ruiz went to the\n\nEurocolombia and showed the confidential informant two\n\nphotographs taken of the defendant at the Customs enforcement\n\noffice following his arrest.  Ruiz asked if the person in the\n\nphoto was the driver of the red Toyota.  The confidential\n\ninformant replied that the person in the photo was the passenger\n\nand not the driver.  At around 7:30 A.M., shortly after agent\n\nRuiz left the ship,  the Eurocolombia departed the port of Ponce\n\nwith the confidential informant aboard.    \n\n       Later that morning, at around 9:00 A.M., Officer de Leon\n\nreceived a phone call from a Santa Isabel resident reporting the\n\npresence of a stranger in the Paso Seco neighborhood.  According\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nto the report, the stranger appeared nervous, wore torn clothes,\n\nand had a wound on his forehead.  Officer de Leon responded to\n\nthe report and arrested the stranger who was later identified as\n\nJose Gonzalez.  Officer de Leon reported this arrest to agent\n\nRuiz.  No evidence indicated that officer de Leon had received a\n\ndescription of Gonzalez prior to his arrest.2  One week later,\n\non July 29, 1990, the remaining four kilos of cocaine were\n\ndiscovered in the backyard of a home located about twenty-five\n\nmeters from where the accident had occurred.\n\n       On August 2, 1991, ten days after the arrest of the\n\nappellant, the Eurocolombia returned to Ponce.  At that time,\n\nagent Ruiz again met with the confidential informant and showed\n\nhim two photo arrays each containing six photos.  One array\n\ncontained a photo of appellant and the other contained a photo of\n\nJose Gonzalez.  From the photo arrays, the confidential informant\n\nidentified Miguel Gomez and Jose Gonzalez as the occupants of the\n\nred Toyota.\n\n       Before trial, appellant filed a motion for discovery\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 requesting: (1) names and\n\naddresses of all informants which the government was going to use\n\nat trial; (2) materials relating to offers of immunity or\n\nleniency offered by the government to potential witnesses; and\n\n                    \n\n2Jose Gonzalez pled guilty before the trial commenced. \n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\n(3) names of the enforcement agents that participated in the\n\nsurveillance at the Ponce pier.  Appellant made no pretrial\n\nrequest, however, to discover documents or photos relating to the\n\npretrial identification procedures within the possession of the\n\ngovernment pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(C).3  At trial,\n\nfollowing the presentation of its case, the government renewed a\n\nprior motion to admit two photo arrays into evidence.4 \n\nAppellant had failed to move to suppress this pretrial\n\nidentification evidence before trial as required by Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 12(b)(3) and (f).  As a result, it was not until the close of\n\nthe government's case-in-chief, when the prosecutor renewed his\n\nmotion to admit the photos, that Gomez first moved to suppress\n\nthe photos.  After hearing the parties' arguments, the district\n\ncourt admitted the photo arrays into evidence.5  Appellant\n\n                    \n\n3The government gave open-file  discovery to defendant.  However,\nthe  parties failed to confirm  in writing what  was contained in\nthe open-file discovery package.  The defendant claims he did not\nsee the photos before  trial yet the government claims  they were\navailable. \n\n4Twice  during  the  government's  case-in-chief  the  prosecutor\nsought to admit the  two photospreads into evidence.   Both times\nthe  court deferred  ruling  on their  admissibility until  after\nappellant had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.\n\n5The confidential informant also made  an in-court identification\nof defendant at trial.  \n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nobjected to the district court's ruling and the government rested\n\nits case.  \n\n   Following the government's case-in-chief,  appellant moved for\n\na judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.6  After\n\nthe district court denied this motion, the defense rested. \n\nFollowing a jury verdict of guilty as to both counts of the\n\nindictment, appellant renewed its Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 motion. \n\nThe district court denied this motion as well, United States v.\n                                                               \n\nGomez-Benabe, 781 F. Supp. 848 (D.P.R. 1991), and Miguel Gomez\n            \n\nappeals.  \n\n                        II.  Discussion  \n\n       Appellant claims that his constitutional rights were\n\nviolated because the photo arrays used for pretrial\n\nidentification were unduly suggestive and the product of an\n\nillegal arrest.  The record is clear, however, that appellant\n\nfailed to make a Rule 16 motion requesting discovery of the\n\npretrial identification evidence before trial.  Rather, appellant\n\nonly sought pretrial discovery of the identity of the\n\n                    \n\n6 Rule 29(c) provides, in its pertinent part:  \n   (c)  Motion after  Discharge of  Jury. If  the jury  returns a\nverdict  of guilty  or is  discharged without  having returned  a\nverdict,  a motion  for  judgment of  acquittal  may be  made  or\nrenewed within 7 days after the jury is discharged or within such\nfurther time as  the court may fix during the  7-day period. If a\nverdict of  guilty is returned the  court may on such  motion set\naside the verdict and enter judgment of acquittal.    \n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nconfidential informant, the identities of the law enforcement\n\nagents, and any exculpatory materials in the government's\n\npossession.  More importantly, appellant also failed to make a\n\nRule 12 motion to suppress the photo identifications before\n\ntrial.  The relevant sections of Fed. R. Crim. P. 12 state:\n\n       (b) Pretrial Motions. Any defense, objection, or\n           Pretrial Motions.\n       request which is capable of determination without\n       the trial of the general issue may be raised before\n       trial by motion.  Motions may be written or oral at\n       the discretion of the judge.  The following must be\n                                                          \n       raised prior to trial:    \n                            \n       *     *    *    *    *    *\n       (3) Motions to suppress evidence; or \n       *     *    *    *    *    *\n       (4) Requests for discovery under Rule 16 . . . .  \n       *     *    *    *    *    *\n       (f) Effect of Failure to Raise Defenses or\n           Effect of Failure to Raise Defenses or\n       Objections. Failure by a party to raise defenses or\n       Objections\n       objections or to make requests which must be made\n       prior to trial, at the time set by the court\n       pursuant to subdivision (c), or prior to any\n       extension thereof made by the court, shall\n       constitute waiver thereof, but the court for cause\n       shown may grant relief from the waiver. \n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3) &amp; (f) (emphasis added).  When, as here,\n\na defendant has failed to take full advantage of his Rule\n\n16(a)(1)(C) discovery request options, his resulting ignorance of\n\na photo's existence does not excuse him from Rule 12's\n\nrequirement that motions to suppress be filed early.\n\n       The plain language of Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3) &amp; (f)\n\nestablishes that Gomez waived his right to a suppression hearing\n\nby failing to move for such a hearing before trial.  See United\n                                                               \n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\nStates v. Leal, 831 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1987).  A court may\n              \n\ngrant relief from this waiver only \"for cause shown.\" United\n                                                            \n\nStates v. Mendoza-Acevedo, 950 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991); United\n                                                                \n\nStates v. Gomez, 770 F.2d 251, 253-54 (1st Cir. 1985).  As we\n               \n\nhave stated before \"the decision to grant or deny relief under\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 12(f) is committed to the sound discretion of\n\nthe trial court and should not be disturbed on appeal absent a\n\nshowing of abuse.\" Gomez, 770 F.2d at 253.  We find no such abuse\n                        \n\nin this case.\n\n       Before trial, appellant did not challenge the\n\ncircumstances surrounding his arrest or the validity of the\n\npretrial photo identification.  Appellant made no pretrial\n\nsuppression motion on either basis.  As the district court\n\npointed out, it \"had no idea that the pretrial identification\n\nprocedures might have been the fruits of an illegal arrest and\n\nsubject to the exclusionary rule or that they had been conducted \n\nin such a way as to possibly violate defendant's due process\n\nright\" until evidence was presented at trial. United States v.\n                                                              \n\nGomez-Benabe, 781 F. Supp. 848, 854 (D.P.R. 1991).  \n            \n\n       As a matter of policy, suppression issues should be\n\nconsidered before trial because \"'interrupt[ing] the course of\n\nthe trial for such auxiliary inquiries impedes the momentum of\n\nthe main proceeding and breaks the continuity of the jury's\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\nattention.'\" Gomez, 770 F.2d at 253, quoting Nardone v. United\n                                                              \n\nStates, 308 U.S. 338, 342 (1939).  The district judge's decision\n      \n\nfurthers this sensible and longstanding policy.\n\n       Furthermore, there is no legitimate explanation for\n\nappellant's delay in filing a suppression motion that would have\n\nallowed the district court to grant relief from the waiver.7 See\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v. Mendoza-Acevedo, 950 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991). \n                                \n\nIn short, the record is that appellant knew all there was to know\n\nabout the circumstances surrounding his arrest necessary to bring\n\na motion to suppress.  We must agree with the district court's\n\nconclusion that \"[w]ithout some reason as to why a motion to\n\nsuppress was not filed, th[e] court c[ould] find no basis for not\n\napplying the waiver rule.8\" Gomez-Benabe, 781 F. Supp. at 854. \n                                        \n\n                    \n\n7At oral argument, appellant  claimed that language in  a certain\nFBI report led appellant's trial counsel to believe that at least\none  of   the  photo   identifications  had  occurred   prior  to\nappellant's  arrest and served as  a basis for  probable cause to\nmake that arrest.  Appellant  argues that this report discouraged\nhis trial counsel from  making a pretrial motion to  suppress the\nphoto identification as the fruit of  an illegal arrest.  The FBI\nreport is not part of  the appellate record.  The district  judge\nobserved   that  appellant  failed  to  present  \"any  legitimate\nexplanation  for  his  failure to  timely  move  to suppress  the\nevidence.\"  United States v. Gomez-Benabe, 781  F. Supp. 848, 854\n                                         \n(D.P.R.  1991).   In these  circumstances, we  may not  take this\nbelated explanation into account on appeal.\n\n8In  fact, codefendant  Jose Gonzalez  apparently considered  the\nissue  as  a potential  defense. In  his  motion to  continue the\ntrial, codefendant's attorney advised  the court of his intention\nto  look  into  the  pretrial identification  issue.    Gonzalez,\nhowever, pled guilty before filing any motions.\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\nIt is unnecessary to address the substantive aspects of\n\nappellant's arguments concerning the legality of his arrest,\n\nsince appellant has totally failed to put the matter in issue.\n\n       We do  not reach  the  merits of  appellant's due  process\n\nclaim  that  the  pretrial  photo   identifications  were  unduly\n\nsuggestive.  The district court construed First Circuit precedent\n\n\"as    limiting   [appellant's]   waiver   to   challenging   the\n\nidentification  procedures  on  'fruit  of  the  poisonous  tree'\n\ngrounds.\"  Gomez-Benabe, 781 F. Supp. at 856.  The district court\n                       \n\nwent  on  to consider  the substance  of appellant's  due process\n\nclaim.9  It is not necessary to make this excursion.\n\n        In United States  v. Barletta, we considered  significant\n                                     \n\nthe difference between motions to \"suppress\" and other motions to\n\nmerely \"exclude\" evidence. 644  F.2d 50, 54-55 (1st Cir.  1981). \n\nGenerally,  motions to \"suppress\" deal with  the operation of the\n\nexclusionary rule or \"'police conduct not immediately relevant to\n\nthe  question of  guilt.'\" Id.  at 54,  quoting, Jones  v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 362 U.S. 257, 264 (1960).  The upshot of this distinction\n      \n\nis that motions  to \"suppress\"  evidence must  be brought  before\n\ntrial  under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 12(b)(3)  while other  motions to\n\n\"exclude\" evidence may be brought  after trial has commenced. Id.\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n9The district  court ultimately  decided that the  pretrial photo\nidentification procedures were not  unduly suggestive and  denied\nappellant's due process claim. Gomez-Benabe, 781 F. Supp. at 859.\n                                           \n\n                               -13-\n                                13\n\nat 54-55.   The district court  interpreted Barletta as  removing\n                                                    \n\nfrom the  operation of the Fed. R. Crim.

Pretrial  photo identification procedures,\n\nhowever, are \"matters of  police conduct not immediately relevant\n\nto the question of guilt\" and are therefore the proper subject of\n\na motion to \"suppress\" as defined in Barletta and governed by the\n                                             \n\nrestrictions  of Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  12(b)(3)  &amp;  (f).  See  id.\n                                                                 \n\nAppellant's due process claims, therefore, have also been waived.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n       By  failing  to  file  a  motion  to  suppress  the  photo\n\nidentifications before  trial as  required  by Fed.  R. Crim.  P.\n\n12(b)(3)  &amp; (f),  appellant  waived his  right  to challenge  the\n\nadmission of the evidence during trial, unless the district court\n\nfound good cause  shown.  Here, the district  judge did not abuse\n\nhis discretion in denying appellant relief from  the waiver under\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 12(f).  Accordingly, the judgments of conviction\n\nare affirmed.   \n    affirmed\n            \n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n",

Background  \n\n       On July 21, 1991, the vessel Eurocolombia arrived in\n\nPuerto Rico at the Ponce municipal pier around 7:00 P.M.1  The\n\nEurocolombia had been under investigation by the United States\n\nCustoms Service (\"Customs\") for eight to nine months.  As part of\n\nan on-going investigation by Customs into narcotics smuggling at\n\nthe municipal pier in Ponce, Customs enforcement personnel were\n\nin the practice of using confidential informants to provide\n\ninformation regarding  narcotics transactions.  One such\n\nconfidential informant, a seaman aboard the Eurocolombia,\n\nsignalled Customs personnel that contraband was on board the ship\n\non this particular night.  After seeing the signal, Customs Agent\n\nJose Ruiz boarded the Eurocolombia and contacted the confidential\n\ninformant.  \n\n       The confidential informant showed agent Ruiz a locker\n\nwhere a Colombian national named Alfonso had placed five one-kilo\n\npackages of cocaine while the Eurocolombia was in port in\n\nColombia.  Alfonso had given the confidential informant two\n\ntelephone numbers and instructed the confidential informant to\n\ncall the phone numbers when he arrived in Ponce, ask for \"Pepe\"\n\nor \"Jose\", and arrange for the exchange of the drugs.  Although\n\n                    \n\n1Evidence  was presented  at trial  that this  vessel arrives  in\nPonce just about every ten days.     \n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\ninitially frustrated by an out-of-order dockside phone, the\n\nconfidential informant eventually reached the Puerto Rico\n\ncontacts around 11:00 P.M. using agent Ruiz's cellular phone.\n\nAfter a series of phone calls, the confidential informant was\n\ninstructed to meet \"Jose\" and a friend, who would be waiting in a\n\nred Toyota four-by-four vehicle, at the Ponce pier gate to make\n\nthe exchange.  Agent Ruiz already had arranged for surveillance\n\nunits to be placed in and around the municipal pier area.      \n\n       The confidential informant taped the five kilos of cocaine\n\nto his body and walked from the vessel, out of the pier area, and\n\nonto Comercio Avenue where he made contact with the red Toyota. \n\nUpon entering the vehicle, he found \"Jose\" in the driver's seat\n\nand appellant in the front passenger seat.  The vehicle moved to\n\na nearby cash-and-carry where they exchanged $10,000 for the\n\ncocaine.  After the exchange, the confidential informant exited\n\nthe vehicle, noted its license plate number, and returned to the\n\nship.  At this point, the confidential informant had given no\n\ndescription of the occupants of the Toyota to Customs personnel.  \n\n       After the confidential informant left the Toyota, the\n\nCustoms enforcement operation unravelled.  Customs surveillance\n\nunits were supposed to stop the vehicle after the transaction was\n\ncompleted.  The red Toyota, however, sped away from the area\n\nbefore Customs agents had an opportunity to detain it.  The\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\noccupants of the Toyota led agent Ruiz and other Customs agents\n\non a high-speed chase through Ponce which ended in the town of\n\nSanta Isabel. \n\n       Although agent Ruiz testified that the Customs agents\n\nnever lost sight of the Toyota, other evidence contradicts his\n\ntestimony.  Apparently, at around 4:30 A.M., Customs agents\n\ndiscovered the abandoned Toyota, which had glanced off a\n\ntelephone pole and had smashed into the wall of a funeral home\n\nnear the entrance to Santa Isabel.  A search of the vehicle\n\nturned up $15.90 in cash, two cellular phones, a revolver\n\nholster, and a one-kilo package which field-tested positive for\n\ncocaine.  Witnesses at the scene told agent Ruiz and Carlos Ruiz,\n\nanother Customs agent, that the two occupants of the red Toyota\n\nfled the vehicle and headed toward town. \n\n       While at the scene investigating the car accident, Puerto\n\nRico police officer Juan de Leon received a local police radio\n\nreport of a person acting strangely at a local bar-restaurant\n\nabout half a kilometer from the accident scene.  Agent Ruiz and\n\nofficer de Leon went to the bar where the bar owner told them\n\nthat a certain stranger appeared nervous and was shaking.  The\n\nnervous stranger was later identified as appellant Miguel Gomez. \n\n       At this point, the officers still had no description of\n\nthe Toyota's occupants.  Appellant did not appear injured and no\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nother evidence linked him to the accident vehicle.  Nevertheless,\n\nbased on the suspect's nervousness and the fact that he was a\n\nstranger, appellant was placed under arrest at around 5:15 A.M.\n\nand was taken first to the scene of the accident and then to the\n\nCustoms enforcement office in Ponce.     \n\n       Following defendant's arrest, two Customs officials\n\nquestioned the confidential informant aboard the Eurocolombia. \n\nFirst, Customs official Manuel Zurita boarded the vessel and\n\nobtained a description of the two occupants of the Toyota from\n\nthe confidential informant.  The confidential informant testified\n\nat trial that Zurita's visit took place between 6:00 and 6:30\n\nA.M..  Shortly after the first visit, agent Ruiz went to the\n\nEurocolombia and showed the confidential informant two\n\nphotographs taken of the defendant at the Customs enforcement\n\noffice following his arrest.  Ruiz asked if the person in the\n\nphoto was the driver of the red Toyota.  The confidential\n\ninformant replied that the person in the photo was the passenger\n\nand not the driver.  At around 7:30 A.M., shortly after agent\n\nRuiz left the ship,  the Eurocolombia departed the port of Ponce\n\nwith the confidential informant aboard.    \n\n       Later that morning, at around 9:00 A.M., Officer de Leon\n\nreceived a phone call from a Santa Isabel resident reporting the\n\npresence of a stranger in the Paso Seco neighborhood.  According\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nto the report, the stranger appeared nervous, wore torn clothes,\n\nand had a wound on his forehead.  Officer de Leon responded to\n\nthe report and arrested the stranger who was later identified as\n\nJose Gonzalez.  Officer de Leon reported this arrest to agent\n\nRuiz.  No evidence indicated that officer de Leon had received a\n\ndescription of Gonzalez prior to his arrest.2  One week later,\n\non July 29, 1990, the remaining four kilos of cocaine were\n\ndiscovered in the backyard of a home located about twenty-five\n\nmeters from where the accident had occurred.\n\n       On August 2, 1991, ten days after the arrest of the\n\nappellant, the Eurocolombia returned to Ponce.  At that time,\n\nagent Ruiz again met with the confidential informant and showed\n\nhim two photo arrays each containing six photos.  One array\n\ncontained a photo of appellant and the other contained a photo of\n\nJose Gonzalez.  From the photo arrays, the confidential informant\n\nidentified Miguel Gomez and Jose Gonzalez as the occupants of the\n\nred Toyota.\n\n       Before trial, appellant filed a motion for discovery\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 requesting: (1) names and\n\naddresses of all informants which the government was going to use\n\nat trial; (2) materials relating to offers of immunity or\n\nleniency offered by the government to potential witnesses; and\n\n                    \n\n2Jose Gonzalez pled guilty before the trial commenced. \n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\n(3) names of the enforcement agents that participated in the\n\nsurveillance at the Ponce pier.  Appellant made no pretrial\n\nrequest, however, to discover documents or photos relating to the\n\npretrial identification procedures within the possession of the\n\ngovernment pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(C).3  At trial,\n\nfollowing the presentation of its case, the government renewed a\n\nprior motion to admit two photo arrays into evidence.4 \n\nAppellant had failed to move to suppress this pretrial\n\nidentification evidence before trial as required by Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 12(b)(3) and (f).  As a result, it was not until the close of\n\nthe government's case-in-chief, when the prosecutor renewed his\n\nmotion to admit the photos, that Gomez first moved to suppress\n\nthe photos.  After hearing the parties' arguments, the district\n\ncourt admitted the photo arrays into evidence.5  Appellant\n\n                    \n\n3The government gave open-file  discovery to defendant.  However,\nthe  parties failed to confirm  in writing what  was contained in\nthe open-file discovery package.  The defendant claims he did not\nsee the photos before  trial yet the government claims  they were\navailable. \n\n4Twice  during  the  government's  case-in-chief  the  prosecutor\nsought to admit the  two photospreads into evidence.   Both times\nthe  court deferred  ruling  on their  admissibility until  after\nappellant had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.\n\n5The confidential informant also made  an in-court identification\nof defendant at trial.  \n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nobjected to the district court's ruling and the government rested\n\nits case.  \n\n   Following the government's case-in-chief,  appellant moved for\n\na judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.6  After\n\nthe district court denied this motion, the defense rested. \n\nFollowing a jury verdict of guilty as to both counts of the\n\nindictment, appellant renewed its Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 motion. \n\nThe district court denied this motion as well, United States v.\n                                                               \n\nGomez-Benabe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1411271\"><a href=\"/opinion/1411271/united-states-v-gomez-benabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.P.R. 1991), and Miguel Gomez\n            \n\nappeals.  \n\n                        II.  Discussion  \n\n       Appellant claims that his constitutional rights were\n\nviolated because the photo arrays used for pretrial\n\nidentification were unduly suggestive and the product of an\n\nillegal arrest.  The record is clear, however, that appellant\n\nfailed to make a Rule 16 motion requesting discovery of the\n\npretrial identification evidence before trial.  Rather, appellant\n\nonly sought pretrial discovery of the identity of the\n\n                    \n\n6 Rule 29(c) provides, in its pertinent part:  \n   (c)  Motion after  Discharge of  Jury. If  the jury  returns a\nverdict  of guilty  or is  discharged without  having returned  a\nverdict,  a motion  for  judgment of  acquittal  may be  made  or\nrenewed within 7 days after the jury is discharged or within such\nfurther time as  the court may fix during the  7-day period. If a\nverdict of  guilty is returned the  court may on such  motion set\naside the verdict and enter judgment of acquittal.    \n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nconfidential informant, the identities of the law enforcement\n\nagents, and any exculpatory materials in the government's\n\npossession.  More importantly, appellant also failed to make a\n\nRule 12 motion to suppress the photo identifications before\n\ntrial.  The relevant sections of Fed. R. Crim. P. 12 state:\n\n       (b) Pretrial Motions. Any defense, objection, or\n           Pretrial Motions.\n       request which is capable of determination without\n       the trial of the general issue may be raised before\n       trial by motion.  Motions may be written or oral at\n       the discretion of the judge.  The following must be\n                                                          \n       raised prior to trial:    \n                            \n       *     *    *    *    *    *\n       (3) Motions to suppress evidence; or \n       *     *    *    *    *    *\n       (4) Requests for discovery under Rule 16 . . . .  \n       *     *    *    *    *    *\n       (f) Effect of Failure to Raise Defenses or\n           Effect of Failure to Raise Defenses or\n       Objections. Failure by a party to raise defenses or\n       Objections\n       objections or to make requests which must be made\n       prior to trial, at the time set by the court\n       pursuant to subdivision (c), or prior to any\n       extension thereof made by the court, shall\n       constitute waiver thereof, but the court for cause\n       shown may grant relief from the waiver. \n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3) &amp; (f) (emphasis added).  When, as here,\n\na defendant has failed to take full advantage of his Rule\n\n16(a)(1)(C) discovery request options, his resulting ignorance of\n\na photo's existence does not excuse him from Rule 12's\n\nrequirement that motions to suppress be filed early.\n\n       The plain language of Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3) &amp; (f)\n\nestablishes that Gomez waived his right to a suppression hearing\n\nby failing to move for such a hearing before trial.

We find no such abuse\n                        \n\nin this case.\n\n       Before trial, appellant did not challenge the\n\ncircumstances surrounding his arrest or the validity of the\n\npretrial photo identification.  Appellant made no pretrial\n\nsuppression motion on either basis.  As the district court\n\npointed out, it \"had no idea that the pretrial identification\n\nprocedures might have been the fruits of an illegal arrest and\n\nsubject to the exclusionary rule or that they had been conducted \n\nin such a way as to possibly violate defendant's due process\n\nright\" until evidence was presented at trial.

The district judge's decision\n      \n\nfurthers this sensible and longstanding policy.\n\n       Furthermore, there is no legitimate explanation for\n\nappellant's delay in filing a suppression motion that would have\n\nallowed the district court to grant relief from the waiver.7 See\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v.

We must agree with the district court's\n\nconclusion that \"[w]ithout some reason as to why a motion to\n\nsuppress was not filed, th[e] court c[ould] find no basis for not\n\napplying the waiver rule.8\" Gomez-Benabe, 781 F.

Appellant  argues that this report discouraged\nhis trial counsel from  making a pretrial motion to  suppress the\nphoto identification as the fruit of  an illegal arrest.  The FBI\nreport is not part of  the appellate record.  The district  judge\nobserved   that  appellant  failed  to  present  \"any  legitimate\nexplanation  for  his  failure to  timely  move  to suppress  the\nevidence.\"  United States v.

In these  circumstances, we  may not  take this\nbelated explanation into account on appeal.\n\n8In  fact, codefendant  Jose Gonzalez  apparently considered  the\nissue  as  a potential  defense. In  his  motion to  continue the\ntrial, codefendant's attorney advised  the court of his intention\nto  look  into  the  pretrial identification  issue.    Gonzalez,\nhowever, pled guilty before filing any motions.\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\nIt is unnecessary to address the substantive aspects of\n\nappellant's arguments concerning the legality of his arrest,\n\nsince appellant has totally failed to put the matter in issue.\n\n       We do  not reach  the  merits of  appellant's due  process\n\nclaim  that  the  pretrial  photo   identifications  were  unduly\n\nsuggestive.  The district court construed First Circuit precedent\n\n\"as    limiting   [appellant's]   waiver   to   challenging   the\n\nidentification  procedures  on  'fruit  of  the  poisonous  tree'\n\ngrounds.\"  Gomez-Benabe, 781 F. Supp. at 856.  The district court\n                       \n\nwent  on  to consider  the substance  of appellant's  due process\n\nclaim.9  It is not necessary to make this excursion.\n\n        In United States  v. Barletta, we considered  significant\n                                     \n\nthe difference between motions to \"suppress\" and other motions to\n\nmerely \"exclude\" evidence. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388308\"><a href=\"/opinion/388308/united-states-v-john-r-barletta-in-re-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54-55 (1st Cir.  1981). \n\nGenerally,  motions to \"suppress\" deal with  the operation of the\n\nexclusionary rule or \"'police conduct not immediately relevant to\n\nthe  question of  guilt.'\" Id.  at 54,  quoting, Jones  v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106022\"><a href=\"/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264 (1960).  The upshot of this distinction\n      \n\nis that motions  to \"suppress\"  evidence must  be brought  before\n\ntrial  under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 12(b)(3)  while other  motions to\n\n\"exclude\" evidence may be brought  after trial has commenced. Id.\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n9The district  court ultimately  decided that the  pretrial photo\nidentification procedures were not  unduly suggestive and  denied\nappellant's due process claim. Gomez-Benabe, 781 F. Supp. at 859.\n                                           \n\n                               -13-\n                                13\n\nat 54-55.   The district court  interpreted Barletta as  removing\n                                                    \n\nfrom the  operation of the Fed. R. Crim.

Pretrial  photo identification procedures,\n\nhowever, are \"matters of  police conduct not immediately relevant\n\nto the question of guilt\" and are therefore the proper subject of\n\na motion to \"suppress\" as defined in Barletta and governed by the\n                                             \n\nrestrictions  of Fed.

Conclusion\n\n       By  failing  to  file  a  motion  to  suppress  the  photo\n\nidentifications before  trial as  required  by Fed.  R. Crim.  P.\n\n12(b)(3)  &amp; (f),  appellant  waived his  right  to challenge  the\n\nadmission of the evidence during trial, unless the district court\n\nfound good cause  shown.  Here, the district  judge did not abuse\n\nhis discretion in denying appellant relief from  the waiver under\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 12(f).  Accordingly, the judgments of conviction\n\nare affirmed.   \n    affirmed\n            \n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n</pre>",
