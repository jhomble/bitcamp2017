This appeal asks us\n          BOWNES,  Senior Circuit Judge.\n                                       \n\nto  review the  district court's  grant  of summary  judgment\n\nsetting aside  a conveyance  of real  property by  defendant-\n\nappellant,  Richard   Gleicher,  as  fraudulent.     Gleicher\n\ndisputes that he intended to  commit a fraud, and argues that\n\nsummary  judgment  is  therefore  inappropriate.   Plaintiff-\n\nappellee, the  Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC),\n\ncontends that Gleicher's conclusory remarks are  insufficient\n\nto overcome the circumstantial evidence of fraud.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                      FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n          The  following facts are undisputed.  In June 1987,\n\nGleicher borrowed $193,000 from the Bank of New England, N.A.\n\n(BNE)  in order  to buy  a three-family  home located  at 7-9\n\nBeacon  Hill  Avenue  in  Lynn,  Massachusetts.    In  return\n\nGleicher executed a demand note  (the \"Note\") in that  amount\n\nin BNE's favor with an expiration  date of May 1, 1990.   The\n\nNote was secured by a mortgage on the Lynn property.  \n\n          Gleicher had several  other financial dealings with\n\nBNE.  In  1988 he personally guaranteed two  other loans, one\n\nfor $1.5 million  to a realty trust and  another for $300,000\n\nto a  limited partnership  (of which  Gleicher was  a general\n\npartner).  The $300,000 loan was in the form of an  unsecured\n\nline of credit due to expire on December 30, 1989.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          On  January 23, 1990, Deborah Stein, a loan officer\n\nat  BNE,  requested an  updated personal  financial statement\n\nfrom  Gleicher.   Two months later  Stein tried  to telephone\n\nGleicher  because   he  had  not   furnished  the   requested\n\ninformation.     On  April  11,  following  a  succession  of\n\nunreturned messages,  Stein finally  succeeded in  contacting\n\nGleicher.  Stein informed Gleicher that the  $300,000 line of\n\ncredit was  fully drawn and  had expired.  She  told Gleicher\n\nthat in order to renew the line,  it would have to be secured\n\nwith,  among other  things, additional  real  estate.   Stein\n\nstressed  the need  for  Gleicher to  send  the bank  updated\n\npersonal financial  statements, including  tax  returns.   In\n\nconnection with the Note, Stein told Gleicher that BNE wanted\n\na recent  appraisal of  the mortgaged property  as well  as a\n\ncurrent  cash  flow  statement.     Finally,  Stein  reminded\n\nGleicher that  the Note was  a demand note and  would shortly\n\nexpire, although  she reassured him that the bank intended to\n\nwork  with  him to  resolve  any problems  that  might arise.\n\nSimilar  financial information was requested of Gleicher from\n\na second  BNE loan officer  with respect to the  $1.5 million\n\nrealty trust loan.\n\n          On  April  16,  1990, five  days  after  Gleicher's\n\nconversation  with Stein, he transferred a piece of property,\n\nlocated at 25-27 Grosvenor Park  in Lynn, from himself to the\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nGrosvenor Park  Realty Trust  (the \"Trust\").1   Gleicher  was\n\nthe  trustee  of the  Trust,  and  his  father was  its  sole\n\nbeneficiary.   No money  changed hands  in this  transaction.\n\nGleicher's  most recent  financial statement,  dated December\n\n31, 1989, indicated that the property was worth  $260,000 and\n\nhad no  outstanding mortgages.   Prior  to the transfer,  the\n\nGrosvenor  Park  property  was Gleicher's  sole  unencumbered\n\nasset.\n\n          On  April  25,   1990,  Gleicher,  acting  in   his\n\nindividual  capacity,  granted  a  $175,000  mortgage on  the\n\nproperty to Harbor Financial Resources, Inc., a Massachusetts\n\ncorporation.   Harbor's annual report, completed in September\n\n1990   by   Gleicher,   indicated  that   Gleicher   was  the\n\ncorporation's president, treasurer, clerk and sole director.\n\n          On  August 1, 1990, Gleicher defaulted on the Note.\n\nOn August 31, BNE \"called in\"  the Note, but Gleicher did not\n\npay.   By this time Gleicher  had also defaulted on his other\n\ntwo obligations to BNE.  In September 1990 BNE commenced this\n\naction   in  state  court  against  a  number  of  defendants\n\nincluding  Gleicher, both individually and as trustee for the\n\nTrust, and Harbor.2  Shortly thereafter, the FDIC became  the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Although the record  is not clear on this,  it would seem\nthat this trust was formed specifically for this transaction.\nThe  Grosvenor Park Realty Trust was  a separate and distinct\ntrust from the one that was loaned $1.5 million by BNE.\n\n2.  The claims  brought  against the  other  defendants  were\nvoluntarily dismissed on December 30, 1992.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nreal  party in  interest, and  the  case was  removed to  the\n\nUnited   States   District   Court   for  the   District   of\n\nMassachusetts.3\n\n          In  February  1991,  the  FDIC  foreclosed  on  the\n\nproperty  that secured  the  Note, and  auctioned  it off  as\n\nrequired by law.   After selling the property  to the highest\n\nbidder and  applying  the proceeds  to the  principal of  the\n\nNote, a deficiency of $88,000 remained.\n\n                             II.\n\n                      PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                                        \n\n          On January  14, 1993,  the FDIC  moved for  summary\n\njudgment  on the remaining  counts of its  amended complaint.\n\nCount V alleged  that Gleicher was personally  liable for the\n\namount of  the deficiency plus  accrued interest.   Count  VI\n\nalleged that Gleicher's conveyance of the property located at\n\n25-27 Grosvenor Park to the Trust, along  with the subsequent\n\nmortgage   granted  to  Harbor,   should  be  set   aside  as\n\n                    \n\n3.  As was the  fate of many New England banking institutions\nin the late 1980's, BNE was unable  to survive the decline in\nthe real estate market, and collapsed under the weight of bad\nloans.  In  January 1991, the FDIC was  appointed Receiver of\nBNE.  The  New Bank of New England (NBNE) was then created as\na  bridge  bank, and  became  the  assignee  of the  FDIC  as\nReceiver for BNE.  In July  1991, NBNE dissolved and the FDIC\nwas appointed as  its Receiver for the purpose  of winding up\nits affairs.    In  December  1992,  the  FDIC  was  formally\nsubstituted  as   the  plaintiff   in  this   action.     For\nsimplicity's sake, we will hereinafter refer to the FDIC when\nwe are talking about BNE, NBNE or the FDIC.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nfraudulent.   Gleicher did not submit a statement of disputed\n\nfacts or an opposition to the motion.\n\n          On March 17, 1993, a hearing was held on the FDIC's\n\nmotion  for  summary  judgment.    At  that  time,  Gleicher,\n\nappearing on his own behalf, handed the court an affidavit in\n\nopposition to the FDIC's motion.  After entertaining argument\n\nfrom both parties, the court held:\n\n          I can't  find any material issue  of fact\n          in dispute in this case, summary judgment\n          is  granted  to  the   plaintiff  on  the\n          deficiency  as of today. . . . [T]here is\n          no  material issue of fact as far as this\n          Court can tell as to the transfer of that\n          property of  the Grosvenor address.   And\n          the Court finds that it was done to avoid\n          creditors  and,  therefore,   fraudulent.\n          And it is set aside.\n\nThe court  also ordered  that the mortgage  to Harbor  be set\n\naside.   On April  8, final judgment  was entered  consistent\n\nwith the court's  ruling.  Because it failed to appear at the\n\nhearing, a default judgment was entered against Harbor.  This\n\nappeal ensued.4\n\n          On  May 6,  1993,  Gleicher  filed  his  notice  of\n\nappeal.    On  June  18  the FDIC  moved  for  sanctions  and\n\ndismissal against  Gleicher based  on his  failure to  comply\n\nwith four separate deadlines, including the one governing the\n\nfiling of his  appellate brief.  Rather than  respond to this\n\n                    \n\n4.  Gleicher  does not contest  the deficiency judgment.   In\naddition,  he conceded  at oral  argument  that the  mortgage\ngiven  to  Harbor  was  invalid  regardless  of  whether  the\ntransfer of the property to the Trust was fraudulent or not.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nmotion, Gleicher moved  for an extension of time  to file his\n\nbrief and to serve  his appendix.  This  motion was filed  on\n\nJuly 7, eight days after  his brief was originally due.   The\n\nFDIC opposed the motion and renewed its motion to dismiss.\n\n          On  July 30, 1993, we granted Gleicher's motion for\n\nan extension and awarded costs to the FDIC in connection with\n\nits  preparation of a counter-appendix.  Our order explicitly\n\nwarned Gleicher and  his counsel that \"no  further extensions\n\n[would]  be  granted\" beyond  August 6,  1993.   Moreover, we\n\nwarned them \"that any continued inattention to the procedural\n\nrequirements on appeal may result in harsher sanctions.\"\n\n          In  an unopposed motion  dated October 8,  the FDIC\n\nonce again moved  for sanctions and dismissal.   Gleicher had\n\nallegedly failed to  comply with either prong of  our July 30\n\norder:  his  brief was not filed  until August 9, and  he had\n\nnot  reimbursed  the  FDIC  for the  costs  of  preparing the\n\ncounter-appendix  despite repeated requests.   On November 2,\n\none day before oral argument, Gleicher paid the FDIC's costs.\n\nFurther,  Gleicher   did  not   attend   a  scheduled   CAMP5\n\nsettlement hearing in  this case despite repeated  efforts to\n\nsecure  his participation  by  both  the  FDIC and  the  CAMP\n\nstaff.6\n\n                    \n\n5.  Civil Appeals Management Program.\n\n6.  At oral argument Gleicher's counsel was unable to offer a\nsatisfactory explanation for any of these failings.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          Under Fed. R.  App. P. 3(a) the failure  of a party\n\n\"to take any  step other than the filing of a timely appeal .\n\n. . is ground . .  . for such action as the court  of appeals\n\ndeems  appropriate, which may include dismissal.\"  Of course,\n\ndismissal is a drastic step, and financial sanctions  are the\n\nmore common course  of action.  See, e.g.,  Christopher W. v.\n                                                          \n\nPortsmouth  Sch. Comm., 877  F.2d 1089, 1099  (1st Cir. 1989)\n                      \n\n(appellees  held  responsible  for   costs  as  sanction  for\n\nuntimely filing of  brief).   Dismissal under  Rule 3(a)  has\n\nrecently been discussed by the Third Circuit:\n\n          Dismissal  of an  appeal  for failure  to\n          comply  with  procedural   rules  is  not\n          favored,   although   Rule    3(a)   does\n          authorize it in  the exercise of a  sound\n          discretion.   That  discretion should  be\n          sparingly  used  unless   the  party  who\n          suffers it has had an opportunity to cure\n          the   default  and   failed  to   do  so.\n          Moreover, before dismissing an appeal, we\n          believe that a court should consider  and\n          weigh   such  factors   as  whether   the\n          defaulting party's  action is  willful or\n          merely  inadvertent,  whether   a  lesser\n          sanction can  bring about  compliance and\n          the  degree  of  prejudice  the  opposing\n          party   has  suffered   because  of   the\n          default.\n\nHorner Equip.  Int'l, Inc. v.  Seascape Pool Ctr.,  Inc., 884\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 89, 93 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\n          In  our  estimation,  Gleicher's conduct  at  least\n\napproaches  the  level   of  behavior  which  would   warrant\n\ndismissal.  First,  our July 30 order clearly placed Gleicher\n\nand his counsel on notice of the necessity of adhering to the\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nrules of this court.  Second, in light of this notice we find\n\nit  difficult  to believe  that Gleicher's  intransigence has\n\nbeen inadvertent.   Nevertheless,  because the  FDIC has  not\n\nsuffered any prejudice  as a result of  Gleicher's failure to\n\nfollow required procedures, apart from being  inconvenienced,\n\nwe have allowed the appeal to go forward.\n\n                             III.\n\n                          THE MERITS\n                                    \n\n          The  sole issue raised  by Gleicher is  whether his\n\naffidavit raises a triable issue as to his intent.\n\n          Our  review   of  summary  judgment   decisions  is\n\nplenary.

We\n\nhave consistently held that a litigant's \"pro se status [does\n\nnot] absolve him  from compliance with  the Federal Rules  of\n\nCivil Procedure.\"   United States v.

Material facts of record set forth in\n          the statement  required to  be served  by\n          the moving party  will be deemed for  the\n          purposes of  the motion to be admitted by\n          opposing parties  unless controverted  by\n          the statement  required to  be served  by\n          opposing parties.\n\n9.  At  the  hearing  before  the  district  court,  Gleicher\ndirected  the court's attention  to his letter  of January 18\naddressed to  the court  and copied  to opposing counsel,  in\nwhich  he \"respectfully request[ed]\" a hearing on the summary\njudgment motion.\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\ndistrict  court's  procedural  rules.   Moreover,  Gleicher's\n\ncharacterization of himself  as a pro se litigant  is at best\n\ndubious.  A  pro se litigant  is \"one who  does not retain  a\n\nlawyer  and  appears for  himself  in  court.\"   Black's  Law\n\nDictionary 1221 (6th ed. 1990).  Although Gleicher did appear\n\non his own behalf at the summary judgment hearing, the record\n\nindicates that, at  the time of the hearing,  Gleicher had no\n\nfewer  than  two  attorneys  of  record.10    Both  of  these\n\nattorneys were served with the FDIC's summary judgment motion\n\nand were still counsel of record for Gleicher at the time his\n\nresponsive papers were due.\n\n          Under  the circumstances,  we are receptive  to the\n\nFDIC's argument  that Gleicher's affidavit should be ignored.\n\nNevertheless,  we will  bend  over backwards  to be  fair and\n\nconsider  that document  as  part  of  the  summary  judgment\n\nrecord.\n\n          Both state  and federal fraudulent  conveyance laws\n\nare implicated in  this action.  Under federal  law, the FDIC\n\nacting   in  its  capacity  as  a  receiver  for  an  insured\n\ninstitution,  may avoid  a transfer  of any  interest of  any\n\n                    \n\n10.  At  the summary judgment hearing the FDIC indicated that\nthe  law  firm of  Gordon &amp;  Wise  had moved  to  withdraw as\ncounsel for Gleicher, although it  had not received a copy of\nthe  motion.   Gleicher's  other  record  counsel,  Peter  R.\nBeatrice,  never moved  to withdraw,  and  has resurfaced  as\nGleicher's  counsel  on this  appeal.   It  was  Beatrice who\noriginally filed answers for Gleicher, in both his individual\ncapacity and as trustee of the Trust, and for Harbor.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nperson who is a debtor of the institution if the transfer was\n\nmade  \"with the  intent  to hinder,  delay,  or defraud\"  the\n\ninstitution  or  the  FDIC.    12  U.S.C.     1821(d)(17)(A).\n\nSimilarly,  under Massachusetts  law,  a transfer  made  with\n\n\"actual  intent .  . .  to  hinder, delay  or defraud  either\n\npresent  or  future  creditors, is  fraudulent,\"  and  may be\n\navoided.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 109A    7, 9 (1990).11\n\n          According to the FDIC,  it has presented conclusive\n\ncircumstantial    evidence    that    Gleicher   fraudulently\n\ntransferred the property at issue.  We have acknowledged that\n\n\"[i]t  is   often  impracticable,  on   direct  evidence,  to\n\ndemonstrate  an actual  intent to  hinder,  delay or  defraud\n\ncreditors.\"   Max  Sugarman  Funeral  Home,  Inc.  v.  A.D.B.\n                                                             \n\nInvestors, 926  F.2d 1248,  1254 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (involving\n         \n\nvoidable fraudulent transfers under   548(a)(1) of Bankruptcy\n\nCode).   Thus, courts frequently infer fraudulent intent from\n\nthe circumstances surrounding a transfer, placing  particular\n\nemphasis on certain indicia or badges of fraud.

It  is unclear whether 12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(17) \"embodies\na separate federal  fraudulent conveyance law, or  whether it\nmerely codifies [Massachusetts] law.\"  Resolution Trust Corp.\n                                                             \nv.

In the present action, the parties have proceeded,\nas  did the  district court,  on  the shared  assumption that\nthere  is no substantive difference between the two statutes.\nBecause we  can see no  material difference between  the two,\nour conclusions apply with equal strength under either law.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n          (1)  actual   or  threatened   litigation\n          against  the  debtor;   (2)  a  purported\n          transfer of  all or substantially  all of\n          the debtor's property;  (3) insolvency or\n          other  unmanageable  indebtedness  on the\n          part  of   the  debtor;  (4)   a  special\n          relationship between  the debtor  and the\n          transferee;  and  (5)  retention  by  the\n          debtor of  the property  involved in  the\n          putative transfer.\n\nId. (citations omitted).   We have held  that \"the confluence\n   \n\nof  several  [badges  of  fraud]  can  constitute  conclusive\n\nevidence of an actual intent to defraud.\"  Id. at 1254-55.\n                                              \n\n          Briefly  summarized,   the  FDIC's   circumstantial\n\nevidence  of fraudulent  intent  consists  of the  following:\n\nGleicher  transferred his sole unencumbered asset to a trust,\n\nof which  he was trustee and his father the beneficiary.  The\n\ntransfer  was made for  no documented consideration  and came\n\njust five  days  after a  major  creditor asked  for  updated\n\nfinancial   information.     Gleicher's  personal   financial\n\nsituation  was rapidly deteriorating.   Only nine  days after\n\nthe transfer,  Gleicher granted  a $175,000  mortgage in  the\n\nproperty, enuring to  his personal benefit, to  a corporation\n\nthat  he  controlled.    Within  four  months,  Gleicher  had\n\ndefaulted on all of his obligations to the bank.\n\n          In response, Gleicher musters the following:\n\n          12.    The  transfer  of 25-27  Grosvenor\n          Park. Lynn was  not a  transfer to  avoid\n          creditors.\n\n          13.     The  beneficiary  of   the  25-27\n          Grosvenor  Park   Trust  is   my  father.\n          Transfer  was made  to  a  trust for  his\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          benefit  to compensate  him for  services\n          rendered  to me and my companies over the\n          course of time.\n\n          14.    At  the  time  that  I  made  this\n          transfer, I had no reason to believe that\n          any  creditor would  be  looking to  this\n          asset  to satisfy  any other  obligation.\n          My  assets exceeded  my  liabilities.   I\n          informed  BNE that  I had  $200,000.00 in\n          cash.\n\n          15.   Until  at least  July  1990, I  had\n          enough   liquid   assets    to   pay   my\n          $193,000.00 obligation to BNE in full.  I\n          was solvent at  the time of  the transfer\n          of the property on Grosvenor Park.\n\n          16.   I was able to pay my obligations as\n          they came due.\n\n          17.   Since January  9, 1990, I  have not\n          owned  or  controlled   Harbor  Financial\n          Resources, Inc.\n\nGleicher Affidavit at 2.  We find the affidavit deficient for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n          First, Gleicher contends that the transfer was made\n\nto his  father as  compensation for  past services  rendered.\n\nBut, Gleicher  has not  specified what  these services  were,\n\nwhen they  were rendered, what  their value was, or  for what\n\ncompany  they  were  performed.   Gleicher's  father  has not\n\nsubmitted  an affidavit in  connection with this  action.  In\n\nfact, there is  no indication that he was ever  made aware of\n\nhis gain.   Moreover, while Gleicher tells us  that he repaid\n\nhis devoted  and hardworking  father with  a valuable  asset,\n\nGleicher immediately  mortgaged that  asset for  his personal\n\nbenefit, thus depriving his father of any benefit from it.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n          Next, Gleicher maintains that he was solvent at the\n\ntime of the transfer  and had the means to satisfy the entire\n\n$193,000  note.    Gleicher has  not,  however,  attached any\n\ndocuments indicating his  financial condition at the  time of\n\nthe transfer.    Moreover,  given  the  uncontroverted  facts\n\nconcerning Gleicher's diminishing net  worth, and the  timing\n\nof  the  transfer  in  relation  to  the   inquiries  by  BNE\n\nemployees,  Gleicher's solvency at  the time of  the transfer\n\nwould not dispel the powerful inferences of fraud.\n\n          Finally, Gleicher contends that, at the time of the\n\ntransfer, he  had no relationship  with Harbor.   Once again,\n\nGleicher has not attached any documentary evidence to support\n\nthis  claim; a claim squarely contradicted by Harbor's annual\n\nreport subscribed to by Gleicher himself in September 1990.\n\n          In Carteret Sav.  &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Jackson, 812 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n36 (1st Cir.  1987), we reviewed a district  court's grant of\n\nsummary   judgment  on   plaintiff's   claim  of   fraudulent\n\nconveyance  under Massachusetts law, where a husband and wife\n\ntransferred  their house  to their  daughter  for one  dollar\n\nwithin  months of two  large judgments being  entered against\n\nthem.  Id. at 40.   There was also evidence indicating  that,\n          \n\nat the time of the transfer, the defendants could not satisfy\n\nall  of their  obligations.   Id.    The Carteret  defendants\n                                                 \n\n\"argued that plaintiff's evidence was insufficient,  but they\n\npresented  no  evidence  of their  solvency,  nor  made other\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nshowing that would establish the existence of a genuine issue\n\nfor trial.\"  812  F.2d at 40.   We affirmed summary  judgment\n\nand held that,  \"[w]here this was  a family transfer  without\n\nconsideration, we can see but one conclusion.\"  Id.\n                                                   \n\n          Our case is strikingly similar.  Given the presence\n\nof  multiple badges  of fraud,  and  Gleicher's inability  to\n\nproduce  even a single  properly documented fact  casting any\n\ndoubt  on  the FDIC's  position,  we  too  can see  only  one\n\nconclusion, namely, that the transfer was fraudulent.\n\n          Because  we find  this appeal  to  be frivolous  we\n\nassess double costs  against appellant.

Plaintiff-\n\nappellee, the  Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC),\n\ncontends that Gleicher's conclusory remarks are  insufficient\n\nto overcome the circumstantial evidence of fraud.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n                      FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n          The  following facts are undisputed.  In June 1987,\n\nGleicher borrowed $193,000 from the Bank of New England, N.A.\n\n(BNE)  in order  to buy  a three-family  home located  at 7-9\n\nBeacon  Hill  Avenue  in  Lynn,  Massachusetts.    In  return\n\nGleicher executed a demand note  (the \"Note\") in that  amount\n\nin BNE's favor with an expiration  date of May 1, 1990.   The\n\nNote was secured by a mortgage on the Lynn property.  \n\n          Gleicher had several  other financial dealings with\n\nBNE.  In  1988 he personally guaranteed two  other loans, one\n\nfor $1.5 million  to a realty trust and  another for $300,000\n\nto a  limited partnership  (of which  Gleicher was  a general\n\npartner).  The $300,000 loan was in the form of an  unsecured\n\nline of credit due to expire on December 30, 1989.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          On  January 23, 1990, Deborah Stein, a loan officer\n\nat  BNE,  requested an  updated personal  financial statement\n\nfrom  Gleicher.   Two months later  Stein tried  to telephone\n\nGleicher  because   he  had  not   furnished  the   requested\n\ninformation.     On  April  11,  following  a  succession  of\n\nunreturned messages,  Stein finally  succeeded in  contacting\n\nGleicher.  Stein informed Gleicher that the  $300,000 line of\n\ncredit was  fully drawn and  had expired.  She  told Gleicher\n\nthat in order to renew the line,  it would have to be secured\n\nwith,  among other  things, additional  real  estate.   Stein\n\nstressed  the need  for  Gleicher to  send  the bank  updated\n\npersonal financial  statements, including  tax  returns.   In\n\nconnection with the Note, Stein told Gleicher that BNE wanted\n\na recent  appraisal of  the mortgaged property  as well  as a\n\ncurrent  cash  flow  statement.     Finally,  Stein  reminded\n\nGleicher that  the Note was  a demand note and  would shortly\n\nexpire, although  she reassured him that the bank intended to\n\nwork  with  him to  resolve  any problems  that  might arise.\n\nSimilar  financial information was requested of Gleicher from\n\na second  BNE loan officer  with respect to the  $1.5 million\n\nrealty trust loan.\n\n          On  April  16,  1990, five  days  after  Gleicher's\n\nconversation  with Stein, he transferred a piece of property,\n\nlocated at 25-27 Grosvenor Park  in Lynn, from himself to the\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nGrosvenor Park  Realty Trust  (the \"Trust\").1   Gleicher  was\n\nthe  trustee  of the  Trust,  and  his  father was  its  sole\n\nbeneficiary.   No money  changed hands  in this  transaction.\n\nGleicher's  most recent  financial statement,  dated December\n\n31, 1989, indicated that the property was worth  $260,000 and\n\nhad no  outstanding mortgages.   Prior  to the transfer,  the\n\nGrosvenor  Park  property  was Gleicher's  sole  unencumbered\n\nasset.\n\n          On  April  25,   1990,  Gleicher,  acting  in   his\n\nindividual  capacity,  granted  a  $175,000  mortgage on  the\n\nproperty to Harbor Financial Resources, Inc., a Massachusetts\n\ncorporation.   Harbor's annual report, completed in September\n\n1990   by   Gleicher,   indicated  that   Gleicher   was  the\n\ncorporation's president, treasurer, clerk and sole director.\n\n          On  August 1, 1990, Gleicher defaulted on the Note.\n\nOn August 31, BNE \"called in\"  the Note, but Gleicher did not\n\npay.   By this time Gleicher  had also defaulted on his other\n\ntwo obligations to BNE.  In September 1990 BNE commenced this\n\naction   in  state  court  against  a  number  of  defendants\n\nincluding  Gleicher, both individually and as trustee for the\n\nTrust, and Harbor.2  Shortly thereafter, the FDIC became  the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Although the record  is not clear on this,  it would seem\nthat this trust was formed specifically for this transaction.\nThe  Grosvenor Park Realty Trust was  a separate and distinct\ntrust from the one that was loaned $1.5 million by BNE.\n\n2.  The claims  brought  against the  other  defendants  were\nvoluntarily dismissed on December 30, 1992.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nreal  party in  interest, and  the  case was  removed to  the\n\nUnited   States   District   Court   for  the   District   of\n\nMassachusetts.3\n\n          In  February  1991,  the  FDIC  foreclosed  on  the\n\nproperty  that secured  the  Note, and  auctioned  it off  as\n\nrequired by law.   After selling the property  to the highest\n\nbidder and  applying  the proceeds  to the  principal of  the\n\nNote, a deficiency of $88,000 remained.\n\n                             II.\n\n                      PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                                        \n\n          On January  14, 1993,  the FDIC  moved for  summary\n\njudgment  on the remaining  counts of its  amended complaint.\n\nCount V alleged  that Gleicher was personally  liable for the\n\namount of  the deficiency plus  accrued interest.   Count  VI\n\nalleged that Gleicher's conveyance of the property located at\n\n25-27 Grosvenor Park to the Trust, along  with the subsequent\n\nmortgage   granted  to  Harbor,   should  be  set   aside  as\n\n                    \n\n3.  As was the  fate of many New England banking institutions\nin the late 1980's, BNE was unable  to survive the decline in\nthe real estate market, and collapsed under the weight of bad\nloans.  In  January 1991, the FDIC was  appointed Receiver of\nBNE.  The  New Bank of New England (NBNE) was then created as\na  bridge  bank, and  became  the  assignee  of the  FDIC  as\nReceiver for BNE.  In July  1991, NBNE dissolved and the FDIC\nwas appointed as  its Receiver for the purpose  of winding up\nits affairs.    In  December  1992,  the  FDIC  was  formally\nsubstituted  as   the  plaintiff   in  this   action.     For\nsimplicity's sake, we will hereinafter refer to the FDIC when\nwe are talking about BNE, NBNE or the FDIC.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nfraudulent.   Gleicher did not submit a statement of disputed\n\nfacts or an opposition to the motion.\n\n          On March 17, 1993, a hearing was held on the FDIC's\n\nmotion  for  summary  judgment.    At  that  time,  Gleicher,\n\nappearing on his own behalf, handed the court an affidavit in\n\nopposition to the FDIC's motion.  After entertaining argument\n\nfrom both parties, the court held:\n\n          I can't  find any material issue  of fact\n          in dispute in this case, summary judgment\n          is  granted  to  the   plaintiff  on  the\n          deficiency  as of today. . . . [T]here is\n          no  material issue of fact as far as this\n          Court can tell as to the transfer of that\n          property of  the Grosvenor address.   And\n          the Court finds that it was done to avoid\n          creditors  and,  therefore,   fraudulent.\n          And it is set aside.\n\nThe court  also ordered  that the mortgage  to Harbor  be set\n\naside.   On April  8, final judgment  was entered  consistent\n\nwith the court's  ruling.  Because it failed to appear at the\n\nhearing, a default judgment was entered against Harbor.  This\n\nappeal ensued.4\n\n          On  May 6,  1993,  Gleicher  filed  his  notice  of\n\nappeal.    On  June  18  the FDIC  moved  for  sanctions  and\n\ndismissal against  Gleicher based  on his  failure to  comply\n\nwith four separate deadlines, including the one governing the\n\nfiling of his  appellate brief.  Rather than  respond to this\n\n                    \n\n4.  Gleicher  does not contest  the deficiency judgment.   In\naddition,  he conceded  at oral  argument  that the  mortgage\ngiven  to  Harbor  was  invalid  regardless  of  whether  the\ntransfer of the property to the Trust was fraudulent or not.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nmotion, Gleicher moved  for an extension of time  to file his\n\nbrief and to serve  his appendix.  This  motion was filed  on\n\nJuly 7, eight days after  his brief was originally due.   The\n\nFDIC opposed the motion and renewed its motion to dismiss.\n\n          On  July 30, 1993, we granted Gleicher's motion for\n\nan extension and awarded costs to the FDIC in connection with\n\nits  preparation of a counter-appendix.  Our order explicitly\n\nwarned Gleicher and  his counsel that \"no  further extensions\n\n[would]  be  granted\" beyond  August 6,  1993.   Moreover, we\n\nwarned them \"that any continued inattention to the procedural\n\nrequirements on appeal may result in harsher sanctions.\"\n\n          In  an unopposed motion  dated October 8,  the FDIC\n\nonce again moved  for sanctions and dismissal.   Gleicher had\n\nallegedly failed to  comply with either prong of  our July 30\n\norder:  his  brief was not filed  until August 9, and  he had\n\nnot  reimbursed  the  FDIC  for the  costs  of  preparing the\n\ncounter-appendix  despite repeated requests.   On November 2,\n\none day before oral argument, Gleicher paid the FDIC's costs.\n\nFurther,  Gleicher   did  not   attend   a  scheduled   CAMP5\n\nsettlement hearing in  this case despite repeated  efforts to\n\nsecure  his participation  by  both  the  FDIC and  the  CAMP\n\nstaff.6\n\n                    \n\n5.

At oral argument Gleicher's counsel was unable to offer a\nsatisfactory explanation for any of these failings.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          Under Fed.

See, e.g.,  Christopher W. v.\n                                                          \n\nPortsmouth  Sch.

First,  our July 30 order clearly placed Gleicher\n\nand his counsel on notice of the necessity of adhering to the\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nrules of this court.  Second, in light of this notice we find\n\nit  difficult  to believe  that Gleicher's  intransigence has\n\nbeen inadvertent.   Nevertheless,  because the  FDIC has  not\n\nsuffered any prejudice  as a result of  Gleicher's failure to\n\nfollow required procedures, apart from being  inconvenienced,\n\nwe have allowed the appeal to go forward.\n\n                             III.\n\n                          THE MERITS\n                                    \n\n          The  sole issue raised  by Gleicher is  whether his\n\naffidavit raises a triable issue as to his intent.\n\n          Our  review   of  summary  judgment   decisions  is\n\nplenary.

At  the  hearing  before  the  district  court,  Gleicher\ndirected  the court's attention  to his letter  of January 18\naddressed to  the court  and copied  to opposing counsel,  in\nwhich  he \"respectfully request[ed]\" a hearing on the summary\njudgment motion.\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\ndistrict  court's  procedural  rules.   Moreover,  Gleicher's\n\ncharacterization of himself  as a pro se litigant  is at best\n\ndubious.  A  pro se litigant  is \"one who  does not retain  a\n\nlawyer  and  appears for  himself  in  court.\"   Black's  Law\n\nDictionary 1221 (6th ed. 1990).  Although Gleicher did appear\n\non his own behalf at the summary judgment hearing, the record\n\nindicates that, at  the time of the hearing,  Gleicher had no\n\nfewer  than  two  attorneys  of  record.10    Both  of  these\n\nattorneys were served with the FDIC's summary judgment motion\n\nand were still counsel of record for Gleicher at the time his\n\nresponsive papers were due.\n\n          Under  the circumstances,  we are receptive  to the\n\nFDIC's argument  that Gleicher's affidavit should be ignored.\n\nNevertheless,  we will  bend  over backwards  to be  fair and\n\nconsider  that document  as  part  of  the  summary  judgment\n\nrecord.\n\n          Both state  and federal fraudulent  conveyance laws\n\nare implicated in  this action.  Under federal  law, the FDIC\n\nacting   in  its  capacity  as  a  receiver  for  an  insured\n\ninstitution,  may avoid  a transfer  of any  interest of  any\n\n                    \n\n10.  At  the summary judgment hearing the FDIC indicated that\nthe  law  firm of  Gordon &amp;  Wise  had moved  to  withdraw as\ncounsel for Gleicher, although it  had not received a copy of\nthe  motion.   Gleicher's  other  record  counsel,  Peter  R.\nBeatrice,  never moved  to withdraw,  and  has resurfaced  as\nGleicher's  counsel  on this  appeal.   It  was  Beatrice who\noriginally filed answers for Gleicher, in both his individual\ncapacity and as trustee of the Trust, and for Harbor.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nperson who is a debtor of the institution if the transfer was\n\nmade  \"with the  intent  to hinder,  delay,  or defraud\"  the\n\ninstitution  or  the  FDIC.    12  U.S.C.     1821(d)(17)(A).\n\nSimilarly,  under Massachusetts  law,  a transfer  made  with\n\n\"actual  intent .  . .  to  hinder, delay  or defraud  either\n\npresent  or  future  creditors, is  fraudulent,\"  and  may be\n\navoided.

We have held  that \"the confluence\n   \n\nof  several  [badges  of  fraud]  can  constitute  conclusive\n\nevidence of an actual intent to defraud.\"  Id. at 1254-55.\n                                              \n\n          Briefly  summarized,   the  FDIC's   circumstantial\n\nevidence  of fraudulent  intent  consists  of the  following:\n\nGleicher  transferred his sole unencumbered asset to a trust,\n\nof which  he was trustee and his father the beneficiary.  The\n\ntransfer  was made for  no documented consideration  and came\n\njust five  days  after a  major  creditor asked  for  updated\n\nfinancial   information.     Gleicher's  personal   financial\n\nsituation  was rapidly deteriorating.   Only nine  days after\n\nthe transfer,  Gleicher granted  a $175,000  mortgage in  the\n\nproperty, enuring to  his personal benefit, to  a corporation\n\nthat  he  controlled.    Within  four  months,  Gleicher  had\n\ndefaulted on all of his obligations to the bank.\n\n          In response, Gleicher musters the following:\n\n          12.    The  transfer  of 25-27  Grosvenor\n          Park. Lynn was  not a  transfer to  avoid\n          creditors.\n\n          13.     The  beneficiary  of   the  25-27\n          Grosvenor  Park   Trust  is   my  father.\n          Transfer  was made  to  a  trust for  his\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          benefit  to compensate  him for  services\n          rendered  to me and my companies over the\n          course of time.\n\n          14.    At  the  time  that  I  made  this\n          transfer, I had no reason to believe that\n          any  creditor would  be  looking to  this\n          asset  to satisfy  any other  obligation.\n          My  assets exceeded  my  liabilities.   I\n          informed  BNE that  I had  $200,000.00 in\n          cash.\n\n          15.   Until  at least  July  1990, I  had\n          enough   liquid   assets    to   pay   my\n          $193,000.00 obligation to BNE in full.  I\n          was solvent at  the time of  the transfer\n          of the property on Grosvenor Park.\n\n          16.   I was able to pay my obligations as\n          they came due.\n\n          17.   Since January  9, 1990, I  have not\n          owned  or  controlled   Harbor  Financial\n          Resources, Inc.\n\nGleicher Affidavit at 2.  We find the affidavit deficient for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n          First, Gleicher contends that the transfer was made\n\nto his  father as  compensation for  past services  rendered.\n\nBut, Gleicher  has not  specified what  these services  were,\n\nwhen they  were rendered, what  their value was, or  for what\n\ncompany  they  were  performed.   Gleicher's  father  has not\n\nsubmitted  an affidavit in  connection with this  action.  In\n\nfact, there is  no indication that he was ever  made aware of\n\nhis gain.   Moreover, while Gleicher tells us  that he repaid\n\nhis devoted  and hardworking  father with  a valuable  asset,\n\nGleicher immediately  mortgaged that  asset for  his personal\n\nbenefit, thus depriving his father of any benefit from it.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n          Next, Gleicher maintains that he was solvent at the\n\ntime of the transfer  and had the means to satisfy the entire\n\n$193,000  note.    Gleicher has  not,  however,  attached any\n\ndocuments indicating his  financial condition at the  time of\n\nthe transfer.    Moreover,  given  the  uncontroverted  facts\n\nconcerning Gleicher's diminishing net  worth, and the  timing\n\nof  the  transfer  in  relation  to  the   inquiries  by  BNE\n\nemployees,  Gleicher's solvency at  the time of  the transfer\n\nwould not dispel the powerful inferences of fraud.\n\n          Finally, Gleicher contends that, at the time of the\n\ntransfer, he  had no relationship  with Harbor.   Once again,\n\nGleicher has not attached any documentary evidence to support\n\nthis  claim; a claim squarely contradicted by Harbor's annual\n\nreport subscribed to by Gleicher himself in September 1990.\n\n          In Carteret Sav.  &amp; Loan Ass'n v.
