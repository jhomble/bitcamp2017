(\"Hemingway\") and Bristol  Terminals, Inc.  (\"Bristol\") for\n\nanticipated  response costs  for the  removal and  remediation of\n\nhazardous substances discovered  on property previously purchased\n\nby Juniper from  the Hemingway-Bristol chapter  11 estate.   Jun-\n\niper's  companion claim  for  cleanup-related  attorney fees  was\n\ndisallowed  as well.   The  district court  affirmed and  Juniper\n\nappeals.   The  chapter 7  trustee (\"trustee\")  cross-appeals the\n\nallowance of Juniper's  priority claim for past  cleanup costs as\n\nan administrative expense.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Between 1963  and 1982, Hemingway and  Bristol continu-\n\nously  owned or  operated a  trucking  business conducted  from a\n\ntwenty-acre  parcel  of  land  located  in Woburn,  Massachusetts\n\n(\"facility\").1   In  May  1980, the  Massachusetts Department  of\n\nEnvironmental  Quality  Engineering  (DEQE) discovered  seventeen\n\ncorroded drums  leaching a semi-solid, tar-like  substance onto a\n\n13.8 acre \"wetlands\" area at the facility.  DEQE informed Heming-\n\nway that  the substance  contained petroleum constituents.   DEQE\n\n                    \n\n     1Hemingway began business operations at the facility shortly\nafter  acquiring it in 1963. In 1974, Hemingway sold the facility\nto Woburn Associates, but  continued to occupy it under  a lease-\nback arrangement with Woburn.   In 1980, Bristol, a  wholly owned\nHemingway subsidiary, acquired the facility from Woburn.\n\n                                4\n\nreceived  assurances  from  Hemingway  that the  drums  would  be\n\nremoved.  The drums were still at the facility when DEQE conduct-\n\ned its last site inspection, in August 1982.\n\n          In July  1982, Hemingway  and Bristol filed  chapter 11\n\npetitions.  With the approval of the  bankruptcy court, appellant\n\nJuniper,  a local  land  developer, purchased  the facility  from\n\ndebtor-in-possession Bristol for $1.6  million on April 29, 1983.\n\nPrior to the purchase, Juniper's representatives conducted an on-\n\nsite inspection but did not walk the wetlands area where DEQE had\n\ndiscovered  the drums;  Juniper contends that  the area  was sub-\n\nmerged at the time.  Seven months  after the sale, the Hemingway-\n\nBristol chapter  11 reorganization proceeding was  converted to a\n\nchapter 7  liquidation proceeding,  and a  chapter 7 trustee  was\n\nappointed.\n\n          In April  1985, drums  containing various  solvents and\n\npesticides classified as \"hazardous substances\" under the Compre-\n\nhensive  Environmental Response, Compensation,  and Liability Act\n\n(\"CERCLA\"),  42 U.S.C.    9601-9657,  9601(14) (1981),  were dis-\n\ncovered at the facility, in the same wetlands area, by the United\n                                                  \n\nStates  Environmental Protection  Agency (\"EPA\").   The following\n\nDecember,  Juniper, then  the \"owner\"  of the  facility, received\n\nnotice that the EPA considered Juniper a \"potentially responsible\n\nparty\" (\"PRP\") under CERCLA, see id.   9607(a).  Shortly thereaf-\n                                    \n\nter the EPA issued  an administrative order requiring Juniper  to\n\nremove  the  hazardous substances  from the  facility at  its own\n\n                                5\n\nexpense.  See  id.   9606.   Juniper claims  $92,088 in  response\n                  \n\ncosts incurred pursuant to the EPA administrative order.2\n\n          Juniper initiated  an adversary proceeding  against the\n\nHemingway-Bristol   estate  for  CERCLA  response  costs  already\n\nincurred  under  the  EPA  administrative order  and  for  future\n\nresponse costs  required to complete the  anticipated cleanup and\n\nremediation.   Initially, the bankruptcy court  denied the trust-\n\nee's  motion for summary judgment on Juniper's CERCLA claim.  The\n\ncourt  determined  that  Juniper's CERCLA  claim,  if  ultimately\n\nallowed, would be entitled to priority payment from the chapter 7\n\nestate as  an administrative  expense of  the chapter  11 estate,\n\nsince Juniper's exposure to CERCLA liability had arisen  from its\n\npostpetition agreement to purchase  the facility from the chapter\n\n11 estate.    In re  Hemingway Transp.,  Inc., 73  B.R. 494,  505\n                                             \n\n(Bankr. D. Mass. 1987) (citing Reading Co. v. Brown, 391 U.S. 471\n                                                   \n\n(1968)).3\n\n                    \n\n     2Juniper alleges  that an engineering firm  was paid $30,208\nto remove the drums;   an environmental consulting firm  was paid\n$7,880 to monitor  the removal  action; and a  law firm was  paid\n$54,000 to ensure adequate compliance with the EPA order.\n     In April 1988, EPA demanded $2.1 million in CERCLA contribu-\ntion  from Juniper  for costs  incurred by  EPA in  assessing and\nevaluating the site.   The PRP notice advised that  Juniper would\nbe  notified  of future  \"cleanup response  costs\"  as well.   In\nFebruary  1989, EPA sent PRP notices to Hemingway and Bristol, as\nformer owner-operators of the facility.  See infra note 9.\n                                                  \n\n     3Although count I of the original Juniper  complaint did not\nassert a right to CERCLA contribution, when the trustee's  motion\nfor summary judgment on  count I was denied the  bankruptcy court\nallowed Juniper to amend count I  to assert a claim for contribu-\ntion under 42 U.S.C.   9607(a).  In re Hemingway Transp., 73 B.R.\n                                                        \nat 507-08. See  also infra note  20.  The  court entered  summary\n                          \njudgment for the trustee  on count II, which alleged  a breach of\nwarranty by Bristol, and on Count III, which sought rescission of\n\n                                6\n\n          The trustee renewed the  motion for summary judgment on\n\nJuniper's claim for  future response costs, and  moved for recon-\n                           \n\nsideration of the  \"administrative expense priority\" ruling  pre-\n\nviously entered by  the bankruptcy court.   The bankruptcy  court\n\nthen  disallowed  Juniper's  claim  for  future  response  costs,\n                                               \n\npursuant to Bankruptcy  Code   502(e)(1)(B), 11  U.S.C.   502(e)-\n\n(1)(B), on the ground that Juniper was the holder of a contingent\n\nCERCLA  contribution claim  based on  a debt  owed EPA  for which\n\nJuniper,  Hemingway,  and  Bristol  were  jointly  and  severally\n\nliable, in connection  with which  Juniper had yet  to incur  any\n\nliability  by the  time of  the allowance  of its  claim.   In re\n                                                                 \n\nHemingway Transp.,  Inc., 105 B.R.  171, 176-78 (Bankr.  D. Mass.\n                        \n\n1989).    The  bankruptcy  court reaffirmed  its  earlier  ruling\n\nentitling Juniper to administrative expense priority on its claim\n\nfor past response costs.\n        \n\n          Following trial  on Juniper's $92,088 claim  for CERCLA\n\nresponse costs previously  incurred, the  bankruptcy court  ruled\n\nthat Hemingway  and Bristol were responsible  parties \"liable\" to\n\nthe EPA,  as they either  owned or  operated the facility  at the\n\n                    \n\nthe land-sale agreement on  the ground of fraudulent misrepresen-\ntation.  As  to count II, the bankruptcy court  held that Juniper\nhad  forfeited any  right to  recover for  breach of  warranty by\nrepresenting in the contract  that it had \"made all  such inspec-\ntions of the premises as [it] wishe[d] to make.\"  Id. at 506.  As\n                                                     \nto  count III, the bankruptcy  court held that  Juniper failed to\nallege fraud with the requisite particularity.  Id. (holding that\n                                                   \nMassachusetts  law  requires  more  than proof  of  the  seller's\nnondisclosure  of  a known  defect;  it requires  proof  that the\nseller  deliberately  concealed,  or  prevented  the  buyer  from\ndiscovering,  known defects).   Juniper  does not  challenge this\nbankruptcy court ruling.\n\n                                7\n\ntime a passive \"disposal\" of hazardous substances occurred at the\n\nfacility.    In re  Hemingway Transp.,  Inc.,  108 B.R.  378, 380\n                                            \n\n(Bankr.  D. Mass.  1989) (holding  that CERCLA  liability arising\n\nfrom  \"disposal\"  need  not  result from  affirmative  acts,  but\n\nencompasses \"leaking\" of previously deposited waste during  PRP's\n\nownership) (citing  United States v. Waste Indus., Inc., 734 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n159, 164 (4th Cir. 1984)).  Significantly, however, the bankrupt-\n\ncy  court noted no  evidence that Hemingway  or Bristol, notwith-\n\nstanding their continuous ownership or possession of the facility\n\nfor  a  period of  twenty  years, either  generated  or deposited\n\nhazardous wastes at the facility.  Id. at 380.\n                                      \n\n          The bankruptcy  court allowed Juniper's  claim for past\n\nresponse  costs in  the amount  of $38,763  as  an administrative\n\nexpense entitled to priority payment, id. at  382, but disallowed\n                                         \n\nthe  $54,000 claim  on  the ground  that  attorney fees  are  not\n\nrecoverable in a private  action under 42 U.S.C.   9607(a)(4)(B).\n\nId. at 383.  Juniper appealed the rulings   disallowing its claim\n   \n\nfor future response  costs and  for attorney fees.   The  trustee\n\ncross-appealed  the order  allowing  Juniper's  $38,763  priority\n\nclaim for  administrative expense.  The  district court affirmed.\n\nIn re Hemingway Transp., Inc., 126 B.R. 656 (D.

Second, Juniper  and\n                               \n\nHemingway-Bristol  are  \"liable\" to  the  EPA  for future  CERCLA\n\nresponse costs (hereinafter:   the \"EPA debt\") because  all three\n\nentities were designated  PRPs by  the EPA.   Third, the  Juniper\n\nclaim  is  \"contingent\" because  the  EPA has  issued  no further\n\ncleanup orders against Juniper;  hence, additional cleanup of the\n\nfacility may not be required.

On  the other  hand, section\n     \n9613(g)(2) authorizes a declaratory  judgment action to determine\nliability  for response  costs  which  \"will  be binding  on  any\nsubsequent action or actions to recover further response costs or\ndamages,\" a  form of relief plainly  encompassed within Juniper's\namended  complaint.  See In re Chateaugay Corp., 944 F.2d at 1008\n                                               \n(noting  that, notwithstanding  CERCLA's  ban on  pre-enforcement\njudicial review,  a bankruptcy  court may estimate  CERCLA claims\npursuant to Bankruptcy Code    502(c)(1), \"with ultimate liquida-\ntion of the claims to await the outcome of normal CERCLA enforce-\nment  proceedings\").    A  \"contingent\" claim  predicated  on  an\notherwise valid  declaratory judgment  entered  pursuant to  sec-\ntion 9613(g)(2) would  be subject to estimation.   See Bankruptcy\n                                                      \nCode   502(c)(1), 11 U.S.C.   502(c)(1) (\"There shall be estimat-\ned for purposes of allowance under this section . . . any contin-\ngent  or unliquidated claim, the fixing  or liquidation of which,\nas  the case may be, would unduly delay the administration of the\ncase. . . .\").\n\n                                14\n\nthe filing  of a contingent claim for  contribution or reimburse-\n\nment entails risk that the assets of the chapter 7 estate will be\n\nexposed  to \"double-dipping\"  by holders  of the  same underlying\n\nclaim  against the estate,  section 502(e)(1)(B)  mandates disal-\n\nlowance  of the  contingent claim.   The  sole purpose  served by\n\nsection 502(e)(1)(B) is to preclude redundant recoveries on iden-\n\ntical  claims  against  insolvent  estates in  violation  of  the\n\nfundamental  Code policy  fostering equitable  distribution among\n\nall  creditors of the same class.  The \"double-dipping\" threat in\n\nthe present  case would result from the  allowance and estimation\n\nof Juniper's contingent claim, and the allowance of an EPA claim,\n\nfor the same future  CERCLA response costs against the  chapter 7\n\nestate.\n\n          Section 502(e)(1)(B) is a  fair and reasonable  measure\n\nas applied  against a contract  guarantor or surety.   Confronted\n\nwith the prospect that its contingent  claim for reimbursement or\n\ncontribution  against a chapter 7 debtor estate may be subject to\n\ndisallowance under  section 502(e)(1)(B), an entity  may elect to\n\ncause its contingent  contract claim to  become \"fixed\" prior  to\n\ndisallowance, see Bankruptcy Code   502(e)(2), by itself satisfy-\n                 \n\ning the debt due the creditor  of the debtor estate, leaving  the\n\nentity as the sole holder of a claim against the  estate based on\n\nthat debt.7  See, e.g., In re Baldwin-United Corp., 55 B.R.  885,\n                                                  \n\n                    \n\n     7Section 502(e)(2) provides:\n\n     A claim  for reimbursement  or contribution of  such an\n     entity that becomes fixed after the commencement of the\n     case shall  be determined,  and shall be  allowed under\n\n                                15\n\n895 (Bankr.  S.D. Ohio  1985).  On  the other  hand, the  section\n\n502(e)(2)  \"fixing\"  option  presents  an   especially  difficult\n\ndilemma for an owner or operator of a  targeted facility, such as\n\nJuniper,  involved  in  a  Superfund contribution  action.    The\n\nonerous CERCLA  remediation process  may take years  to complete,\n\nleaving  PRPs  holding  the  bag; that  is,  holding  unallowable\n                                                                 \n\ncontingent claims for contribution  or reimbursement against  the\n\nchapter 7 estate, claims  typically totaling millions of dollars.\n\nIn such  circumstances, section 502(e)(1)(B) may  operate to pre-\n\nclude innocent PRPs from recovering CERCLA response costs from  a\n\nchapter 7  estate even though  the estate clearly  is responsible\n\nfor all or  part of the environmental contamination.   If the EPA\n\nopts  to refrain from participating  in any distribution from the\n\nchapter 7 estate, as  it may do simply  by not filing a proof  of\n\nclaim,  Juniper may end up as the only potential EPA enforcement-\n\naction target still left standing and  solvent.8  Thus, sometimes\n\n                    \n\n     subsection (a), (b),  or (c) of this section, or disal-\n     lowed under subsection (d) of this section, the same as\n     if such claim had  become fixed before the date  of the\n     filing of the petition.\n\n11 U.S.C.   502(e)(2).\n\n     8EPA  enforcement actions  generally are  excepted  from the\nautomatic stay  provisions.  See Bankruptcy  Code   362(b)(4), 11\n                                \nU.S.C.   362(b)(4); New York v.

Even were the  EPA to reduce to judgment its\nclaim  for prepetition  damages  against the  chapter 7  debtors,\nhowever,  the  judgment  would  not be  enforceable  against  the\ndebtors' estate  except through  the normal claim  allowance pro-\ncess.   See Bankruptcy  Code   362(b)(5), 11  U.S.C.   362(b)(5).\n           \nMoreover, corporate debtors cannot receive a discharge, see id.  \n                                                               \n727(a)(1),  11 U.S.C.    727(a)(1)  (\"The court  shall grant  the\ndebtor a  discharge, unless . . . the debtor is not an individual\n. . . .\").

Mass. 1985).   Once the trustee manages the initial burden of\n\nproducing substantial  evidence,  however, the  ultimate risk  of\n\nnonpersuasion as  to the allowability  of the claim  resides with\n\nthe  party asserting the claim.  See Bankruptcy Rules, at 191-92;\n                                                     \n\nsee also  In re VTN, Inc.,  69 B.R. 1005, 1006  (Bankr. S.D. Fla.\n                         \n\n1987).  In the present case, therefore, the chapter 7 trustee was\n\nrequired to come forward with substantial evidence that Juniper's\n\nclaim is one for CERCLA \"contribution,\" which would implicate two\n\nrelated questions:  (1) whether Hemingway-Bristol is contingently\n\n\"liable\"  to the EPA for  future response costs,  and (2) whether\n\nJuniper is \"liable\" to the EPA on the same \"debt.\"\n\n     4.   Hemingway-Bristol \"Liability\" on Joint Obligation.\n                                                           \n\n          At  the time it  allowed Juniper's claim  for past res-\n                                                            \n\nponse  costs,  the bankruptcy  court  determined  that Hemingway-\n\nBristol  had  owned or  operated  the facility  when  the passive\n\n\"disposal\" of  hazardous substances occurred  and that Hemingway-\n\n                                19\n\nBristol  had  actual knowledge  of  the presence  of  the leaking\n\nbarrels.  Hence, Hemingway-Bristol is a \"covered person,\" strict-\n\nly  liable to the  EPA for future  response costs  pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C.   9607(a)(4)(A).\n\n          Juniper  nonetheless  suggests  that  the  term \"liable\n\nwith\" should  be interpreted in light of the singular legislative\n\npurpose  underlying the  section  502(e)(1)(B)  contingent  claim\n\ndisallowance provision.   Like any other  claim for contribution,\n\nsays Juniper,  its claim for  future CERCLA response  costs could\n\npose  no  \"double-dipping\"  threat  were the  EPA,  for  whatever\n\nreason, not to participate in any distribution from the chapter 7\n\nestate.   Moreover, the  EPA has elected  not to  assert a  claim\n\nagainst the  estate, despite  considerable  prodding by  Juniper.\n\nRather, the EPA repeatedly has manifested its intention to forego\n\nany  immediate claim  against the  chapter 7  estate in  favor of\n\nadministrative enforcement  actions against  other PRPs,  such as\n\nJuniper.9   The  trustee responds  that  the literal  language of\n\nsection  502(e)(1)(B)  directs  disallowance  of  the  codebtor's\n\n[Juniper's] contingent  claim even though the  creditor [EPA] has\n\nnot filed  a proof of claim  by the time the  codebtor's claim is\n\nconsidered for allowance.\n\n          Section 502(e)(1) directs disallowance  of the claim of\n\na  codebtor who  is liable  with the  debtor on  the \"claim  of a\n                                            \n\n                    \n\n     9In a May 1987 letter to  Juniper, the EPA suggested that it\nhad already exercised its discretion to refrain from asserting an\nenforcement action against the  chapter 7 estate, at least  as of\nthat time.  Two years later, however, the EPA sent PRP notices to\nHemingway and Bristol.\n\n                                20\n\ncreditor.\"   The pivotal terms     \"claim\" and  \"creditor\"    are\n\ndefined.  A \"claim\" is  a \"right to payment, whether or  not such\n                                \n\nright is reduced  to judgment,  liquidated, unliquidated,  fixed,\n\ncontingent,  matured,  unmatured,  disputed,  undisputed,  legal,\n\nequitable, secured, or unsecured.\"   Bankruptcy Code   101(4), 11\n\nU.S.C.    101(4) (emphasis  added).   A \"creditor\" is  an \"entity\n\nthat has a claim against the debtor that arose at the time  of or\n\nbefore  the order for relief concerning the debtor.\"  Id.    101-\n                                                         \n\n(9), 301 (\"The commencement  of a voluntary case under  a chapter\n\nof  this  title  constitutes  an  order  for  relief  under  such\n\nchapter.\").\n\n          The EPA  presumably holds a  prepetition claim  against\n\nthe chapter  7 estate,  since its  contingent \"right to  payment\"\n\naccrued while Bristol and Hemingway owned or operated the facili-\n\nty at which the  hazardous waste \"disposal\" occurred.   Cf. In re\n                                                                 \n\nChateaugay, 944 F.2d  at 1002-06 (EPA  claim for CERCLA  response\n          \n\ncosts  is a prepetition claim if the contamination occurred prior\n\nto the petition, without regard to when EPA discovered contamina-\n\ntion, or incurred response costs).  Although section 502(e)(1)(B)\n\nplainly does  not require that a   creditor's right to payment be\n\nevidenced by a  timely proof  of claim, or  a previously  allowed\n\nclaim, see In re Wedtech Corp., 85 B.R. 285, 289 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.\n                              \n\n1988), it is nonetheless incumbent on the trustee to produce sub-\n\nstantial  evidence of the existence of a  right to payment on the\n\npart of the creditor.\n\n          The co-liability  clause  in section  502(e)(1),  viz.,\n                                                               \n\n                                21\n\n\"liable with the  debtor,\" interpreted in  light of its  singular\n\npurpose, might permit allowance of a non-fixed codebtor claim for\n\nCERCLA contribution if the creditor were foreclosed from partici-\n                                                   \n\npating in any  distribution from the estate under Bankruptcy Code\n\n  726(a).   Nevertheless, though we reject  the trustee's conten-\n\ntion that  the EPA might yet demonstrate \"excusable neglect\" war-\n\nranting  an extension  of time  to file  a  proof of  claim,10 we\n\nmust  examine other means which  may remain open  to EPA's parti-\n\ncipation in any chapter 7 distribution.\n\n          The EPA may participate  in a distribution to unsecured\n\ncreditors under section 726(a)(2)(C) if it was never scheduled as\n\na \"creditor\" of the  estate, and had  no actual knowledge of  the\n\nproceedings in time to  file a proof of claim.   See In re Global\n                                                                 \n\nPrecious  Metals, Inc., 143  B.R. 204,  205-06 (Bankr.  N.D.

Since the  EPA could no\nlonger satisfy any  of the  six conditions for  extension of  the\nninety-day bar date set  forth in Bankruptcy Rule 3002(c),  it is\nprecluded from  asserting a  timely proof  of  claim against  the\nchapter  7  estate.   See  Fed. R.  Bankr.  P. 9006(b)(1).   Rule\n                         \n9006(b) plainly precludes resort  to Rule 9006(b)(1) to  extend a\ntime period prescribed in Rule 3002(c), except \"to the extent and\nunder  the conditions stated in [Rule 3002(c)].\"  Id. at 9006(b)-\n                                                     \n(3).\n\n     11Bankruptcy  Code   726(a)(2)(C)  provides for  \"payment of\nany allowed  unsecured claim, other than a claim of a kind speci-\nfied  in paragraph (1), (3), or (4)  of this subsection, proof of\nwhich  is . . . tardily filed under section 501(a) of this title,\nif (i) the creditor that holds such claim did not  have notice or\nactual knowledge of the case in time for timely filing of a proof\nof  such claim under section 501(a) of this title; and (ii) proof\nof such claim is filed in time to permit payment  of such claim.\"\n\n                                22\n\nwould remain  if Juniper's  claim were to  be allowed,  as it  is\n\nconceivable that EPA might yet file an allowable claim.12\n\n          In this case, however,  the harsh results occasioned by\n\nBankruptcy Code   502(e)(1)(B) are mitigable through  recourse to\n\nBankruptcy Code    501(c), which provides that,  \"[i]f a creditor\n\ndoes not timely file a proof of such creditor's claim, the debtor\n\nor the trustee may file a proof of such claim.\"  See also Fed.

Although  section  501(c) is  permissive (\"may\n\nfile\"),  rather than  mandatory, and  is designed  principally to\n\nprevent creditors  from depriving  debtors  of the  benefit of  a\n\ndischarge under Bankruptcy Code   727, 11 U.S.C.   727, cf. supra\n                                                                 \n\nnote 8, in these circumstances there are sound reasons to require\n\nthe chapter 7 trustee  to shoulder the initial burden of filing a\n\nsurrogate claim in behalf of the EPA as a precondition to obtain-\n\n                    \n\n11 U.S.C.   726(a)(2)(C).  The appellate record does not disclose\nwhether EPA  was listed as a  creditor.  In addition,  it is con-\nceivable,  though  unlikely, that  EPA's  CERCLA  claim might  be\nentitled to  share in any subordinate  distribution under section\n726(a)(3),  as an  \"allowed  unsecured claim  proof  of which  is\ntardily filed,\" even if  EPA was scheduled, or had  actual notice\nof the case prior to the bar date.

Instead of  automatic disal-\nlowance,  some courts  have suggested  that the  bankruptcy court\nsharply  discount the  codebtor's  claim to  offset this  all-or-\nnothing  contingency,  or direct  that  any  distribution to  the\ncodebtor be  placed in trust, to  be expended only to  reduce the\ncommon debt.  See In re Allegheny Int'l., Inc., 126 B.R. 919, 924\n                                              \n(W.D. Pa. 1991),  aff'd, 950 F.2d  721 (3d Cir. 1991).

In such a  case, while\n     there might be a prospect of securing at  least partial\n     satisfaction from the assets  of the debtor, the credi-\n     tor would  forego this  possibility and merely  proceed\n     with his claim against  the codebtor.  By the  time the\n     creditor decided to take  such action, any period fixed\n     for the  filing of claims might have  elapsed.  Indeed,\n     the debtor's estate might  have been fully administered\n     by  the trustee  so  that the  codebtor  would be  left\n     without the possibility  of even partial  reimbursement\n     to the extent he  has satisfied the claim of  the debt-\n     or's creditor.

Of course,  even\n\nthis  modest burden would be obviated if the surrogate claim were\n\nto be superseded by the  EPA's filing of its own proof  of claim.\n\nSee id. 14\n       \n\n          More  importantly,  mandatory resort  to  the trustee's\n\noption  to file a surrogate  proof of claim  under section 501(c)\n\nmore  readily comports with the allocation of the burden of proof\n\nunder section  502(e)(1)(B), which  would require the  trustee to\n\ncome  forward with  substantial support  for the  section 502(e)-\n                               \n\n(1)(B) objection to Juniper's proof of claim, and hence, substan-\n\ntial evidence  that Hemingway  and Bristol  were \"liable\" to  the\n\nEPA.   See supra  Section II.A.3.   In addition,  the trustee has\n                \n\ntitle and  ready access to  the debtors' records,  see Bankruptcy\n                                                      \n\nCode    521(4), 11 U.S.C.   521(4) (\"[D]ebtor shall . . . surren-\n\nder to  trustee  all property  of  the estate,  including  books,\n\ndocuments, records, and papers . . . .\"); In re Bentley, 120 B.R.\n                                                       \n\n                    \n\n     14Although  the EPA can no  longer file a  \"timely\" proof of\nclaim now  that the bar date  has passed, see supra  note 10, its\n                                                   \nforbearance triggers the trustee's and Juniper's rights to file a\nproof of claim  in EPA's behalf.  Under Bankruptcy Rules 3004 and\n3005(a),  the trustee and Juniper normally would have only thirty\ndays  from  the bar  date to  file their  surrogate claims.   But\ninsofar as  EPA \"did not  have notice or actual  knowledge of the\ncase in  time  for timely  filing  of a  proof  of . . .  claim,\"\nBankruptcy  Code   726(a)(2)(C)(i),  see also  supra note  11 and\n                                                    \naccompanying text, the EPA  can yet file a belated claim that can\nreceive payment along with  other timely-filed unsecured  claims,\nso long  as \"proof  of  such claim  is filed  in  time to  permit\npayment  of such  claim.\"   Id.    726(a)(2)(C)(ii).   Thus,  the\n                               \ntrustee and Juniper,  as EPA surrogates, can avail  themselves of\nthe section 726(a)(2)(C) \"extended filing\" provision.\n\n                                25\n\n712, 714 (S.D.N.Y. 1990),  and the right to require  the debtors'\n\nofficers to submit to examination,  see Bankruptcy Code   521(3),\n                                       \n\n11  U.S.C.   521(3)  (\"[D]ebtor shall  . .  . cooperate  with the\n\ntrustee  as necessary to enable the trustee to perform the trust-\n\nee's  duties .  . . .\"); Fed.  R. Bankr. P.  4002(4) (Debtor must\n\n\"cooperate with the trustee in . . . the examination of proofs of\n\nclaim . . . .\");  In re Neese, 137 B.R. 797, 801 (C.D. Cal. 1992)\n                             \n\n(\"'[C]ooperate'  is a broad term . . . .\").  Thus, the trustee is\n\nin  a far  better position  than Juniper  to ferret  out evidence\n\nrelevant to the EPA's claim against the debtors.\n\n          Although  disallowance of Juniper's  CERCLA claim under\n\nsection 502(e)(1)(B) is not  strictly foreclosed by EPA's failure\n\nto file timely proof  of its claim, we  cannot overlook the  fact\n\nthat the trustee's reliance  on section 502(e)(1)(B) may occasion\n\na pointless financial loss to Juniper and result in a windfall to\n\nthe chapter  7 estate, notwithstanding Juniper's  best efforts to\n\ninduce EPA to file its claim.  In  this vein, we note that resort\n\nto subsections 501(b)  and (c) would not  compel EPA's participa-\n\ntion in the bankruptcy proceedings, cf. In re Hemingway  Transp.,\n                                                                \n\n70 B.R.  549 (Bankr. D.  Mass. 1987) (finding  sovereign immunity\n\nwould preclude mandatory joinder of EPA as party); cf. also infra\n                                                                 \n\nnote  26, but  nevertheless would  compel a  set-aside  for EPA's\n\nbenefit at the time of distribution regardless of its decision to\n\nrefrain from filing a  claim against the chapter  7 estate.   The\n\ndistribution  to EPA  would result  in a  reduction in  the total\n\nindebtedness  to EPA for which  Juniper and the  chapter 7 estate\n\n                                26\n\nare  alleged to be  co-liable.  In  our view, the  EPA's recalci-\n\ntrance,  whatever its  administrative justification,  provides no\n\nrelevant  legal or  equitable  basis for  barring  resort to  the\n\nalternative  surrogate-claim  filing  procedure authorized  under\n\nsubsections 501(b) and (c).\n\n          Accordingly,  we  vacate  the  bankruptcy  court  order\n\ndisallowing  Juniper's claim  under  section  502(e)(1)(B).    On\n\nremand, the  bankruptcy court  should prescribe a  reasonable bar\n\ndate by which the chapter 7  trustee must elect whether to file a\n\nsurrogate EPA claim pursuant to Bankruptcy Code   501(c), without\n\nprejudice to  Juniper's right to  submit a surrogate  claim under\n\nsubsection  502(b)  as well.15   Should  the  trustee not  file a\n\ntimely surrogate  claim  (and  should Juniper  not  do  so),  the\n\nsection 502(e)(1)(B) objection should be dismissed, and the court\n\nshould  estimate Juniper's  direct  claim against  the chapter  7\n\nestate  pursuant  to  normal  claim-allowance  procedures.    See\n                                                                 \nBankruptcy Code   502(c).\n\n                    \n\n     15Unlike a creditor filing  in its own behalf, or  a trustee\nseeking to  avail the debtor of  the full benefit of  a chapter 7\ndischarge, in this  case the  chapter 7 trustee  may have  little\nincentive  to maximize any surrogate claim in behalf of EPA, thus\ndepleting  any  pro-rata  dividend available  to  other unsecured\ncreditors.   A similar problem may arise if any superseding proof\nof claim filed by EPA were to  understate (in Juniper's view) the\nchapter 7  debtors' share of  the CERCLA obligation.   We  do not\nconstrue  subsections  501(b)  and  (c) as  suggesting  that  the\ntrustee could  preempt a  surrogate  EPA claim  by Juniper  under\nsection  501(b)  asserting that  the  chapter  7 estate's  CERCLA\nliability to EPA is  greater than that asserted in  the trustee's\nsection  501(c) surrogate  claim.   Rather, the  bankruptcy court\nshould  entertain evidence from the trustee  and Juniper, for the\npurpose  of estimating the value  of the EPA  claim under section\n502(c).\n\n                                27\n\n     5.   Juniper's \"Liability\" on Joint Obligation.\n                                                   \n\n          In the event the trustee  should file a surrogate claim\n\nin behalf of the EPA pursuant to sections 501(c) and 726(a)(2)(C)\n\nfollowing  remand, we  outline the  standards governing  its con-\n\nsideration by the bankruptcy court.\n\n          Juniper's \"contribution\" claim differs in one important\n\nrespect from codebtor claims  normally subjected to  disallowance\n\nunder section 502(e)(1)(B).  In the typical contractual relation-\n\nship  between  a  principal  and its  surety  or  guarantor,  the\n\ncodebtor's  (surety's  or guarantor's)  obligation on  the common\n\ndebt  arises at  the same  time as  the creditor's  (principal's)\n\n\"right  to payment\"  from  the debtor     during  the prepetition\n                                                                 \n\nperiod     which necessarily means that both the creditor and the\n      \n\ncodebtor  hold prepetition  claims  against  the  debtor  estate.\n                          \n\nHere, on the other hand, regardless whether the EPA has a prepet-\n\nition or a postpetition claim, Juniper's  \"right to payment\" from\n\nHemingway-Bristol arose,  at the earliest, when  it purchased the\n                                         \n\nfacility from  the Hemingway-Bristol  chapter 11 estate  in April\n\n1983.   Only then did Juniper  become an \"owner and  operator\" of\n\nthe contaminated  facility, hence a \"covered  person\" under CERC-\n\nLA.16   Since  Juniper undeniably  holds a  postpetition \"claim,\"\n                                                        \n\nBankruptcy  Code    101(9),  301, 11  U.S.C.    101(9),  301, its\n\n                    \n\n     16The  bankruptcy court implicitly acknowledged as much when\nit  approved Juniper's  request  for past  response  costs as  an\n                                         \nadministrative expense:  \"Juniper's  cause of action under CERCLA\narose when the property  containing the drums was  transferred to\nJuniper  or, alternatively,  when Juniper  expended money  in re-\nsponse to  the  EPA's administrative  order.\"   In  re  Hemingway\n                                                                 \nTransp., 73 B.R. at 503.\n       \n\n                                28\n\n\"proof of claim\" under Bankruptcy Code    501 and 502 is no  less\n\nreadily     and presumably even more  accurately    characterized\n\nas \"a  request for payment  of an  administrative expense\"  under\n\nBankruptcy  Code    503(a).   See  Bankruptcy  Code   348(d),  11\n                                 \n\nU.S.C.   348(d)  (providing that claims arising  after the filing\n\nof a chapter 11 petition and before conversion to chapter 7 shall\n\nbe treated as prepetition claims, unless  they qualify as \"admin-\n\nistrative expenses\" under section 503(b)).17\n\n                    \n\n     17Courts  have  long  recognized  a  category  of  allowable\nadministrative expenses resulting  in no  discernible benefit  to\nthe  debtor estate, see In re Charlesbank Laundry, Inc., 755 F.2d\n                                                       \n200  (1st Cir.  1985),  in instances  where fundamental  fairness\nrequired that  the claimant's  right to distribution  take prece-\ndence over the  rights of general creditors.   See Reading Co. v.\n                                                              \nBrown,  391 U.S. 471 (1968).  In Reading, several business firms,\n                                        \nwhose premises were damaged  by a fire negligently caused  by the\nreceiver appointed  to operate  a Chapter XI  business, requested\nthat their fire-loss claims be allowed as administrative expenses\nof  the  Chapter XI  estate,  notwithstanding the  fact  that the\nlosses sustained as a result of the fire resulted in no \"benefit\"\nto  the  Chapter XI  estate.    Noting the  \"decisive,  statutory\nobjective [of] fairness to all persons  having claims against the\ninsolvent,\" Reading, 391 U.S. at 477, the Supreme Court held that\n                   \nthe  claims for postpetition fire loss were allowable as costs of\nadministration.  Its  rationale was equitable  in nature:   unse-\ncured creditors  in a  Chapter XI reorganization  anticipate that\ntheir agreement to defer receipt of payment  on their prepetition\nclaims   may  facilitate  the  reorganization  debtor's  ultimate\nrehabilitation, thereby enhancing their prospects for recovery on\ntheir prepetition claims.   Unlike holders of prepetition claims,\nhowever, the firms  whose business premises  were damaged by  the\npostpetition  fire negligently  caused by  the receiver  had \"the\ninsolvent business [involuntarily] thrust upon them  by operation\nof law.\"  Id.  Similarly, in  Charlesbank, we extended Reading to\n                                                              \npostpetition fines imposed on a  chapter 11 estate for deliberate\ndisregard of an injunction. See Charlesbank, 755 F.2d at 203.\n                                           \n     In citing Reading and Charlesbank as support for its  provi-\n                                      \nsional decision granting Juniper administrative  priority for its\npostpetition  contribution claims,  the bankruptcy  court focused\nentirely on  the debtors'  failure to disclose  the environmental\n                        \nrisk  prior to the 1983  sale, and the  perceived \"unfairness\" in\nthe \"debtor attempting to transfer its liability or potential for\nliability  under state  or federal  environmental laws\"  in those\n\n                                29\n\n          Bankruptcy  Code    503(a)(1)(A) enables  an  entity to\n\nfile a request for payment  of an administrative expense, includ-\n\ning  \"the actual, necessary costs and  expenses of preserving the\n\nestate.\"   \"As a general rule, a request for  priority payment of\n\nan administrative  expense pursuant to  Bankruptcy Code    503(a)\n\nmay qualify if (1) the right to payment arose from a postpetition\n\ntransaction with the  debtor estate, rather  than from a  prepet-\n\nition  transaction with  the  debtor, and  (2) the  consideration\n\nsupporting the right to  payment was beneficial to the  estate of\n\nthe  debtor.\"  In re Hemingway Transp.,  Inc., 954 F.2d 1, 5 (1st\n                                             \n\nCir. 1991) (citing  In re Mammoth Mart,  Inc., 536 F.2d 950,  954\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1976)).  The trustee argues that administrative expense\n\npriority  under Mammoth Mart is  wholly unavailable to Juniper on\n                            \n\nits claims for past and future response costs, as Juniper's right\n\nto  contribution from the chapter  7 estate was  not supported by\n\nconsideration (i.e.,  Juniper's outlay  of response  costs) which\n                   \n\ncould  \"benefit\" the estate.   Thus, the trustee  points out that\n\nthe contaminated facility  was no longer property  of the chapter\n\n                    \n\ncircumstances. See In re Hemingway Transp., 73 B.R. at 504.  Thus\n                                          \ninterpreted, Reading  might permit Juniper to  recover the entire\n                    \ncost of  its extant \"injury\"     or the past and  future costs of\nremediation    despite the fact that  it has yet to incur some of\nthese  response costs.  Unlike the injured parties in Reading and\n                                                             \nCharlesbank, however, Juniper dealt  voluntarily on a contractual\n                                                \nbasis  with the chapter 11  estate.  No  principle of fundamental\nfairness would  entitle Juniper  to administrative  priority over\nother unsecured  creditors of the Hemingway-Bristol  estate if it\nfailed to  exercise due  diligence in  all  the circumstances  to\nprotect itself, from the outset, against any imposition of CERCLA\njoint  and several liability.  In addition, lack of due diligence\nwould, for reasons explained below at pp. 36-38,  prevent Juniper\nfrom escaping  the strictures of  section 502(e)(1)(B)'s \"fixing\"\nrequirement.\n\n                                30\n\n11 estate, hence Juniper's incurrence of response costs would not\n\nbring the estate  into compliance with federal  or state environ-\n\nmental regulations.  Cf. In re  Stevens, 68 B.R. 774, 783 (D.

Nor\n           \n\ncould the CERCLA response costs incurred by Juniper \"benefit\" the\n\nchapter 11 estate while the estate remained jointly and severally\n\nliable on the EPA debt.   Although we agree that Juniper's incur-\n\nrence of CERCLA response  costs might not benefit the  estate, on\n                               \n\nthe facts of this case we cannot agree that Mammoth Mart priority\n                                                        \n\nis altogether unavailable to Juniper.\n\n          In  the  context  of  their  arm's-length purchase-sale\n\ntransaction in 1983, we must presume that Juniper and the chapter\n\n11  estate were cognizant of  the federal and state environmental\n\nlaws then in effect,  and that, notwithstanding Juniper's result-\n\ning  status as an \"owner or operator\" of the contaminated facili-\n\nty,  the chapter 11 estate  could remain liable  for any response\n\ncosts later incurred by Juniper and for which the debtors (or the\n\n                                31\n\ndebtor  estate)  were liable  under  CERCLA  section 9607(a),  an\n\nobligation explicitly  provided for  presently in 42  U.S.C.    -\n\n9607(a)(4)(B) and 9613(f).   See O'Neil, 883 F.2d at  179 (noting\n                                       \n\nthat  SARA contribution provisions  merely \"codif[ied] [a remedy]\n\nthat  most courts had concluded  was implicit in  the 1980 Act\");\n\nMarden Corp. v.

There is  no record evidence\n\nthat the  estate either  contracted away  its obligation  to con-\n\ntribute, or  bargained for a right to  indemnification from Juni-\n\nper.   See  42 U.S.C.    9607(e) (purported  transfers of  CERCLA\n          \n\nliability cannot exonerate transferor, but indemnification agree-\n\nments are permissible).   Similarly, to the extent that  the $1.6\n\nmillion purchase price for  the facility presumptively  reflected\n\nthe parties'  allocation of the risks relating to these contribu-\n\ntion costs, the $1.6 million constituted \"consideration\" support-\n\ning  Juniper's right  to  payment for  contribution for  response\n\ncosts from the  estate.  Obviously, this  substantial infusion of\n\ncash benefitted the chapter 11 rehabilitation effort.  Thus,  the\n\n$1.6 million  in purchase monies constituted  the requisite base-\n\nline  \"consideration\" for  Juniper's right  to  contribution; and\n\nresponse costs subsequently incurred by Juniper a mere maturation\n\nof that right, immaterial for Mammoth Mart purposes. \n                                          \n\n          On the  other hand, we agree that Mammoth Mart priority\n                                                        \n\nis unavailing to Juniper insofar as its right to contribution for\n\nfuture  response costs remains \"contingent\" at the time the bank-\n\n                                32\n\nruptcy court considers Juniper's  claim for allowance against the\n\ndebtor  estate.

Even  though  Juniper's  post-\n\npetition contribution  claim, once allowed, would  be entitled to\n                                          \n\npriority  treatment under  section 503(b), the  parallel restric-\n\ntions in section 502(e)(1)(B)  pose an additional hurdle.   Under\n\nits clear terms, section  502(e)(1)(B) does not apply exclusively\n\nto  \"creditors,\" or  in other  words, to  holders of  prepetition\n                                                                 \n\nclaims for reimbursement  or contribution.  Section  502(e)(1)(B)\n\nrefers  to  the holder  of the  claim as  an  \"entity,\" not  as a\n\n\"creditor\"  of the  estate.18   Accordingly,  Juniper's  priority\n\n\"claim for  reimbursement or contribution\" would  be allowable if\n\neither:  (1) Juniper and the chapter 11  estate are not strictly,\n      \n\njointly, and severally liable  (\"liable with the debtor\") on  the\n\nEPA debt under the liability provisions of the CERCLA statute, or\n                                                                 \n\n(2)  Juniper's response  costs have  become \"fixed\"  and \"actual\"\n\n(i.e., have been expended by Juniper for remediation or paid over\n     \n\nto the EPA) by the time  Juniper's claim is considered for disal-\n\nlowance.  As Juniper's contingent claim for future response costs\n\nis, by definition, not \"fixed,\" Juniper cannot escape  the conse-\n\nquences of  section 502(e)(1)(B)  unless it  is not strictly  and\n\njointly  \"liable\" with Hemingway-Bristol  on the  EPA debt.   Cf.\n                                                                 \n\ninfra Section II.C.

We turn, therefore, to the question of Juniper's alleged\n\nliability to the EPA.\n\n          The threshold  question is whether Juniper  is even as-\n\nserting  a direct CERCLA claim  against the chapter  7 estate, or\n                 \n\nmerely a derivative claim  for \"contribution\" from the chapter  7\n                   \n\nestate.  CERCLA section 9613(f) is the sole statutory basis for a\n\nright  to \"contribution,\" see supra note 5 and accompanying text,\n                                   \n\nbut CERCLA prescribes other remedial  provisions as well.  Unlike\n\nsection 9613(f), a  private right of  action for CERCLA  response\n\ncosts under  section 9607(a)(4)(B)  is available to  \"any person\"\n                                                                \n\nwho incurs necessary response costs, presumably without regard to\n\nwhether  the plaintiff is an EPA target,  i.e., a PRP or \"covered\n                                              \n\nperson\" under section 9607(a).

It alleges that  (1) Juniper is a current owner\n\nof  the facility,  but not that  it is  a \"covered  person\" under\n\nsection 9607(a); (2) Hemingway and Bristol fraudulently concealed\n\nthe presence of  hazardous wastes  at the facility  prior to  the\n\n1983 sale; and (3) Juniper neither knew nor had \"reason to  know\"\n\n                    \n\n     21The bankruptcy court opinion  states:  \"In the  context of\nthis case, it is possible to view Juniper as a direct creditor of\nHemingway and as an  entity jointly liable with the  Debtor.\"  In\n                                                                 \nre Hemingway Transp., 105 B.R. at 175.\n                    \n\n                                36\n\nof the contamination until 1985.\n\n          The  bankruptcy court  concluded that  Juniper, as  the\n\ncurrent \"owner\" of the facility, undoubtedly would be \"liable\" to\n\nthe  EPA in an enforcement  action simply by  virtue of its prima\n                                                                 \n\nfacie  status  as  a  \"covered  person\"  under section 9607(a).22\n     \n\nThe undefined  term \"liable\" is  common to both  CERCLA   9607(a)\n\nand Bankruptcy Code   502(e)(1)(B).   Its construction presents a\n\nquestion of law subject to  plenary review.  See In re  Erin Food\n                                                                 \n\nServs., Inc., 980  F.2d 792, 794  (1st Cir. 1992)  (citing In  re\n                                                                 \n\nLaRoche, 969 F.2d 1299, 1301 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n       \n\n          Of  course,  not  all  \"covered  persons\" are  strictly\n\nliable  for  response costs.   The  harsh  effects of  the strict\n\nliability  rule  are  subject  to mitigation  through  resort  to\n\ncertain affirmative defenses.  Section 9607(b) expressly provides\n\nthat \"[t]here shall be no liability under section [9607](a) . . .\n                                   \n\nfor a person otherwise  liable who can establish by  a preponder-\n\n                    \n\n     22The bankruptcy court based  its section 502(e)(1)(B)  dis-\nallowance  on the ground that Juniper had denominated its claim a\nderivative claim  for \"contribution,\"  thereby conceding  its co-\nliability with  the Hemingway-Bristol estate  for future response\ncosts.  In our view, this ruling exalts  form over substance, and\nignores both  the liberality  with which  pleadings must  be con-\nstrued and the  right to plead  alternative or seemingly  \"incon-\nsistent\" claims.

Section 9607(b)(3)  would afford  a complete\n\ndefense to CERCLA liability if Juniper were to establish that (1)\n\nit acquired the facility after the initial deposit of the hazard-\n\nous substances;  (2) at the  time of its acquisition,  it did not\n\nknow and had \"no reason to know\" that any hazardous substance was\n                               \n\ndeposited  at  the facility;  and (3)  once  the presence  of the\n\nhazardous substance  became known, Juniper exercised  due care in\n\nthe  circumstances.

On  the other  hand, the bankruptcy  court found  that\n\"none of  the interested parties, including  the Trustee, Juniper\nand the two  courts that approved the sale,  were apprised of the\npresence of hazardous  wastes on the  property, despite the  DEQE\naction.\"  In re Hemingway Transp., 73 B.R. at 501-02.\n                                 \n\n     24The  EPA  informed Juniper  in May  1987 that  its alleged\ncontribution to the passive disposal was undetermined because the\nextent of the  post-1983 \"contaminant plume\" at the  facility had\nyet to be ascertained.\n\n                                39\n\ncent landowner\"  defense, for several reasons:   Juniper (1) knew\n\nin 1983  that the facility was in close proximity (200 feet) to a\n\nlarger Superfund  site already included on  the national priority\n\nlist;  (2) made no preacquisition inquiry of EPA or DEQE concern-\n\ning  possible contamination in the  area; and (3)  did not obtain\n\navailable maps  showing an unpaved  access road to  the allegedly\n\ninaccessible portion of the facility where the drums were found.\n\n          The EPA  opinion is  not necessarily dispositive  as to\n\nthe allowability of a claim or an administrative expense request.\n\nNevertheless, after  trial on the issue  of Hemingway's liability\n\nfor  past response  costs, the  bankruptcy court  noted (notwith-\n\nstanding  Juniper's contention that the drums  were located in an\n\narea which was inaccessible  at the time of  the 1983 sale)  that\n\n\"easy access to the location of the barrels is possible along the\n            \n\nCity  of  Woburn's  sewer  easement,  which  parallels  the  MBTA\n\ntracks.\"  In  re Hemingway  Transp.,  108 B.R.  at  380 (emphasis\n                                   \n\nadded).  The record further suggests that Juniper, an experienced\n\nland  developer in the Woburn  area, may have  been familiar with\n\nthe environmental risks posed by its acquisition of the facility,\n\nand  therefore may  have  been cognizant  that  the $1.6  million\n\npurchase price  reflected a discount  due to contamination.   Cf.\n                                                                 \n\nSmith Land &amp; Improvement Corp. v. Celotex  Corp., 851 F.2d 86, 90\n                                                \n\n(3d Cir.  1988) (in allocating responsibility  between vendor and\n\npurchaser, court may consider any implicit discount in sale price\n\nas reflecting assumption of risk of contamination).\n\n          On  the  other  hand,  the record  indicates  that  the\n\n                                40\n\nbankruptcy court may have considered Juniper's responsibility for\n\nany contamination extremely minimal,  especially in comparison to\n\nHemingway-Bristol.  For example, in  allowing Juniper's contribu-\n\ntion  claims for past response  costs, the bankruptcy court allo-\n                     \n\ncated  total financial  responsibility to  Hemingway-Bristol, see\n                                                                 \n\nsupra  note 4,  despite  the fact  that the  court also  found no\n     \n\nevidence that Hemingway-Bristol,  throughout twenty years'  occu-\n\npancy,  ever  generated  or  deposited hazardous  wastes  at  the\n\nfacility.   The bankruptcy court  further found that  Juniper was\n\nnever \"apprised  of the presence of hazardous  wastes. . . .\"  In\n                                                                 \n\nre Hemingway Transp., 73  B.R. at 501.  And, of  course, discount\n                    \n\nprices are not  uncommon in forced sales of  the assets of insol-\n\nvent estates.\n\n          Since the bankruptcy court's disallowance  of Juniper's\n\nclaim must be vacated  on independent grounds, see supra  Section\n                                                        \n\nII.A.4, on  remand the  trustee will  have the  burden to  file a\n\nsurrogate  claim in  behalf  of the  EPA and  the burden  to come\n                                            \n\nforward with substantial evidence that Juniper is not entitled to\n\nan \"innocent landowner\" defense.  The ultimate burden of proof on\n\nthat defense, however, will remain  with Juniper.  The bankruptcy\n\ncourt  should determine  whether Juniper  made  \"all appropriate\"\n\npreacquisition  inquiry  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.    9601(35),  a\n\nfactual finding  which  would be  subject to  clear error  review\n\nonly.  Should the bankruptcy court find that Juniper did not have\n\nnotice  or actual knowledge of  the contamination at  the time it\n\npurchased  the facility  in 1983,  Juniper's  claim for  past and\n\n                                41\n\nfuture  response  costs  should  be estimated25  and  allowed  as\n\nadministrative  expenses entitled  to priority.26   On  the other\n\nhand,  if Juniper did not  take all appropriate  steps to protect\n\nitself from CERCLA liability, its lack of diligence exposed it to\n\nthe  harsh consequences  of strict,  joint and  several liability\n\n                    \n\n     25Because of  its earlier  section 502(e) disallowance,  the\nbankruptcy court refused to  permit Juniper to introduce evidence\nof anticipated future cleanup costs.  Although we need not decide\nthe issue at  this juncture,  we note that  the EPA's  nonbinding\npreliminary  allocation  of  responsibility may  be  inadmissible\nevidence as to the  value of Juniper's claim for  future response\ncosts, see 42 U.S.C.   9622(e)(3)(C) (\"The nonbinding preliminary\n          \nallocation of responsibility shall  not be admissible as evidence\nin  any proceeding  . . .  [nor] constitute  an apportionment  or\nother statement on the divisibility of harm or causation.\"), and,\non remand, that  it may be incumbent on  Juniper to present other\nevidence of the extent of its \"injury.\"\n\n     26The determination of  Juniper's CERCLA \"liability\" by  the\nbankruptcy court is required solely for purposes of the allowance\nor disallowance of Juniper's proof of claim, a core proceeding in\nbankruptcy, and  the court cannot ignore the possibility that the\nEPA might  yet maintain  a successful enforcement  action against\nJuniper.   But  unlike  the holder  of  a prepetition  claim  for\n                                                     \ncontribution,  which normally must await final distribution under\nBankruptcy Code    726, Juniper would enjoy  a distinct distribu-\ntional advantage  should it succeed in  establishing its entitle-\nment  to the  \"innocent  landowner\" defense  under section  9607-\n(b)(3).  The court properly could provide for the immediate, pre-\n                                                           \ndistribution payment of Juniper's \"claim\" in trust, see, e.g., In\n                                                                 \nre Allegheny Int'l, Inc., 126  B.R. at 924 (\"Creation of a  trust\n                        \nto be expended on  contingent claims is a frequently  used mecha-\nnism  for  insuring that  such  funds  are properly  disbursed.\")\n(citing  In re Johns-Manville Corp., 68  B.R. 618, 625-26 (Bankr.\n                                   \nS.D.N.Y. 1986,  aff'd, 78  B.R. 407 (S.D.N.Y.  1987), aff'd,  843\n                                                           \nF.2d  636 (2d  Cir.  1988)), exclusively  for \"necessary\"  future\nresponse  costs at  the facility.

In this manner, the EPA debt would be reduced\n         \npro tanto by  any disbursement  from the  trust account,  thereby\n         \neffecting a de  facto \"fixing\" of  the EPA debt should  EPA later\n                     \nattempt to  file a claim against the chapter 7 estate.

In that event, Juniper's claim would be subject to\n\nthe section 502(e)(2) \"fixing\"  requirement and Juniper would not\n\nbe entitled  to administrative  expense priority with  respect to\n\nany allowable CERCLA claim.\n\nB.   Juniper's Appeal: Disallowance of\n     Attorney Fees (42 U.S.C.   9607(a)).\n                                        \n\n          Juniper argues  for an award of  attorney fees pursuant\n\nto 42 U.S.C.   9607(a)(4)(B), which makes no reference to \"attor-\n\nney fees\"  in private  cost recovery  actions.   Juniper contends\n\nthat  the term  \"necessary costs of  response\" should  be broadly\n\nconstrued  to encompass  attorney  fee awards  so  as to  advance\n\nCERCLA's  remedial  purposes by  inducing  PRPs  to cooperate  in\n\ninitiating  prompt cleanup  efforts.   We affirm  on  the grounds\n\nadvanced  in the well-reasoned district court opinion.  See In re\n                                                                 \n\nHemingway Transp., Inc., 108 B.R. at 383.\n                       \n\n          Absent an explicit statutory  authorization, a party is\n\nnot entitled to recover attorney fees simply because it prevailed\n\nin the  litigation.

See, e.g., 42 U.S.C.  \n                                                    \n\n9610(c)  (employee-whistleblowers  may  recover  \"all  costs  and\n\nexpenses  (including attorney's fees\") .  . . .\");  id.   9659(f)\n                                                       \n\n(prevailing parties in private citizen suits may recover costs of\n\nlitigation,  \"including reasonable  attorney  and expert  witness\n\nfees\"). Moreover, Congress  did not  consider, and  SARA did  not\n\ninclude,  any  attorney fee  award  amendment  applicable to  the\n\n                                43\n\nprivate  cost recovery  provision in  section 9607(a)(4)(B).   We\n\ntherefore  conclude that  Congress has  elected not  to authorize\n\nattorney fee awards in these actions.  Cf. Dedham Water, 972 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  461  (\"[L]itigation-related  expenses  are,  of  course,  not\n\ncompensable as  response costs incurred by  private parties under\n\nCERCLA   [9607].\")  (citing Regan v.

We\n\nconclude  that the present claim was waived.  At trial, Juniper's\n\nattorney fee billings  were admitted in  evidence.  Juniper  sug-\n\ngested no  distinction between  attorney fees incurred  for liti-\n\n                                44\n\ngative  and  administrative  purposes.27   Juniper's  failure  to\n\nadvance  the present  contention  below  deprived the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt  of an  opportunity  to consider  it,  thereby waiving  the\n\nclaim.   See In re LaRoche,  969 F.2d 1299, 1305  (1st Cir. 1992)\n                          \n\n(arguments  not raised in  bankruptcy court cannot  be raised for\n\nfirst time on appeal); In re 604 Columbus Ave.  Realty Trust, 968\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1332, 1343 (1st Cir. 1992) (same).28 \n\nC.  The Trustee's Cross-Appeal:  Administrative\n    Expense Priority for Past Response Costs.\n                                            \n\n          The trustee appeals  the allowance  of Juniper's  claim\n\nfor past response costs as  an administrative expense entitled to\n\npriority distribution.  The bankruptcy court ruled that Juniper's\n\nCERCLA liability  resulted from its postpetition  purchase of the\n\nfacility from Hemingway-Bristol, debtor in possession, during the\n\ncourse  of the chapter 11 proceeding.  The bankruptcy court found\n\nthat it would be  fundamentally \"unfair\" not to allow  Juniper to\n\n                    \n\n     27Prior  to  admitting  Juniper's  attorney  fee billing  in\nevidence, the bankruptcy judge stated:  \"[A]ssuming  only for the\nmoment  that  legal services  are  a compensable  item  of damage\n[under CERCLA], then aren't  all reasonable fees incurred by  the\nplaintiff  resulting  from  the  alleged harm,  aren't  they  all\ncompensable? . . . [D]idn't [Juniper's attorneys] perform servic-\nes as a result of  the acts of the defendant if I find the defen-\ndant  liable?\"  Thus, the court plainly signaled its intention to\ntreat Juniper's entire attorney fee request as either compensable\nor noncompensable.\n\n     28Even  assuming  the issue  was  preserved,  the record  on\nappeal does not enable reliable appellate review.  It is impossi-\nble to determine with  reasonable confidence whether the attorney\nfees incurred  by Juniper were reasonably  \"necessary\" to facili-\ntate  its compliance  with  the EPA  administrative order,  or to\ndiscover  the existence or whereabouts of other PRPs who might be\namenable to suit by Juniper in an action for contribution.\n\n                                45\n\nreceive  payment of  its contribution claim  in advance  of other\n\ncreditors.  See supra note 17 (noting court's reliance on Reading\n                                                                 \n\nCo. v. Brown, 391 U.S. 471 (1968)).\n            \n\n          We  affirm the  allowance of  Juniper's claim  for past\n\nresponse costs as an  administrative expense entitled to priority\n\ndistribution under Bankruptcy Code    503(b)(1)(A), 507(a)(1) and\n\n726(a)(1).  See  Norris v.  Lumbermen's Mut. Cas.  Co., 881  F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1144,  1151-52 (1st Cir. 1989) (appellate court may affirm on any\n\nground supported by the record).  As concerns Juniper's claim for\n\nCERCLA  response  costs previously  incurred, its  entitlement to\n\npriority  does not  hinge  on the  court's  determination of  the\n\nmerits  of  Juniper's  \"innocent  landowner\" defense.    Even  if\n\nJuniper and  the Hemingway-Bristol estate are  co-\"liable\" on the\n\nEPA  debt, Juniper's claim  for past  response costs  escapes the\n\nsection  502(e)(1)(B)  co-liability  problem encountered  by  its\n\nclaim  for  future response  costs,  because  Juniper's right  to\n\npayment  for past  response costs  became \"fixed\"  upon Juniper's\n\nincurrence of  actual and necessary  response costs prior  to the\n\ntime its claim was considered for  allowance.  On the other hand,\n\nif Juniper and  the estate are  not co-\"liable\" on the  EPA debt,\n\nbecause  Juniper  has the  benefit  of  the \"innocent  landowner\"\n\ndefense, both its  past and future response costs are recoverable\n\nas priority administrative expenses  under either Mammoth Mart or\n                                                              \n\nReading.\n       \n\n                               III\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n                                46\n\n          We vacate the  bankruptcy court's section  502(e)(1)(B)\n\ndisallowance of  Juniper's claim for  future response costs.   On\n\nremand,  the bankruptcy court shall permit  the chapter 7 trustee\n\nand  Juniper a  reasonable time  within which  to  file surrogate\n\nclaims in  behalf of the EPA  under sections 501(b) or  501(c) of\n\nthe  Bankruptcy Code.  Should the trustee file a timely surrogate\n\nclaim,  and  should  Juniper  choose to  press  for  simultaneous\n\nallowance  of  its so-called  \"direct\"  claim,  the court  should\n\ndetermine  whether  Juniper would  be  entitled  to an  \"innocent\n\nlandowner\"  defense  pursuant to  42  U.S.C.    9601(35)(B).   If\n\nJuniper is  so entitled, its  claim for \"contribution\"  should be\n\nallowed  as an administrative expense.

Jun-\n\niper's  companion claim  for  cleanup-related  attorney fees  was\n\ndisallowed  as well.   The  district court  affirmed and  Juniper\n\nappeals.   The  chapter 7  trustee (\"trustee\")  cross-appeals the\n\nallowance of Juniper's  priority claim for past  cleanup costs as\n\nan administrative expense.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Between 1963  and 1982, Hemingway and  Bristol continu-\n\nously  owned or  operated a  trucking  business conducted  from a\n\ntwenty-acre  parcel  of  land  located  in Woburn,  Massachusetts\n\n(\"facility\").1   In  May  1980, the  Massachusetts Department  of\n\nEnvironmental  Quality  Engineering  (DEQE) discovered  seventeen\n\ncorroded drums  leaching a semi-solid, tar-like  substance onto a\n\n13.8 acre \"wetlands\" area at the facility.  DEQE informed Heming-\n\nway that  the substance  contained petroleum constituents.   DEQE\n\n                    \n\n     1Hemingway began business operations at the facility shortly\nafter  acquiring it in 1963. In 1974, Hemingway sold the facility\nto Woburn Associates, but  continued to occupy it under  a lease-\nback arrangement with Woburn.   In 1980, Bristol, a  wholly owned\nHemingway subsidiary, acquired the facility from Woburn.\n\n                                4\n\nreceived  assurances  from  Hemingway  that the  drums  would  be\n\nremoved.  The drums were still at the facility when DEQE conduct-\n\ned its last site inspection, in August 1982.\n\n          In July  1982, Hemingway  and Bristol filed  chapter 11\n\npetitions.  With the approval of the  bankruptcy court, appellant\n\nJuniper,  a local  land  developer, purchased  the facility  from\n\ndebtor-in-possession Bristol for $1.6  million on April 29, 1983.\n\nPrior to the purchase, Juniper's representatives conducted an on-\n\nsite inspection but did not walk the wetlands area where DEQE had\n\ndiscovered  the drums;  Juniper contends that  the area  was sub-\n\nmerged at the time.  Seven months  after the sale, the Hemingway-\n\nBristol chapter  11 reorganization proceeding was  converted to a\n\nchapter 7  liquidation proceeding,  and a  chapter 7 trustee  was\n\nappointed.\n\n          In April  1985, drums  containing various  solvents and\n\npesticides classified as \"hazardous substances\" under the Compre-\n\nhensive  Environmental Response, Compensation,  and Liability Act\n\n(\"CERCLA\"),  42 U.S.C.    9601-9657,  9601(14) (1981),  were dis-\n\ncovered at the facility, in the same wetlands area, by the United\n                                                  \n\nStates  Environmental Protection  Agency (\"EPA\").   The following\n\nDecember,  Juniper, then  the \"owner\"  of the  facility, received\n\nnotice that the EPA considered Juniper a \"potentially responsible\n\nparty\" (\"PRP\") under CERCLA, see id.   9607(a).  Shortly thereaf-\n                                    \n\nter the EPA issued  an administrative order requiring Juniper  to\n\nremove  the  hazardous substances  from the  facility at  its own\n\n                                5\n\nexpense.  See  id.   9606.   Juniper claims  $92,088 in  response\n                  \n\ncosts incurred pursuant to the EPA administrative order.2\n\n          Juniper initiated  an adversary proceeding  against the\n\nHemingway-Bristol   estate  for  CERCLA  response  costs  already\n\nincurred  under  the  EPA  administrative order  and  for  future\n\nresponse costs  required to complete the  anticipated cleanup and\n\nremediation.   Initially, the bankruptcy court  denied the trust-\n\nee's  motion for summary judgment on Juniper's CERCLA claim.  The\n\ncourt  determined  that  Juniper's CERCLA  claim,  if  ultimately\n\nallowed, would be entitled to priority payment from the chapter 7\n\nestate as  an administrative  expense of  the chapter  11 estate,\n\nsince Juniper's exposure to CERCLA liability had arisen  from its\n\npostpetition agreement to purchase  the facility from the chapter\n\n11 estate.

The PRP notice advised that  Juniper would\nbe  notified  of future  \"cleanup response  costs\"  as well.   In\nFebruary  1989, EPA sent PRP notices to Hemingway and Bristol, as\nformer owner-operators of the facility.

The  bankruptcy  court reaffirmed  its  earlier  ruling\n\nentitling Juniper to administrative expense priority on its claim\n\nfor past response costs.\n        \n\n          Following trial  on Juniper's $92,088 claim  for CERCLA\n\nresponse costs previously  incurred, the  bankruptcy court  ruled\n\nthat Hemingway  and Bristol were responsible  parties \"liable\" to\n\nthe EPA,  as they either  owned or  operated the facility  at the\n\n                    \n\nthe land-sale agreement on  the ground of fraudulent misrepresen-\ntation.

As\n                                                     \nto  count III, the bankruptcy  court held that  Juniper failed to\nallege fraud with the requisite particularity.  Id.

The  sole purpose  served by\n\nsection 502(e)(1)(B) is to preclude redundant recoveries on iden-\n\ntical  claims  against  insolvent  estates in  violation  of  the\n\nfundamental  Code policy  fostering equitable  distribution among\n\nall  creditors of the same class.  The \"double-dipping\" threat in\n\nthe present  case would result from the  allowance and estimation\n\nof Juniper's contingent claim, and the allowance of an EPA claim,\n\nfor the same future  CERCLA response costs against the  chapter 7\n\nestate.\n\n          Section 502(e)(1)(B) is a  fair and reasonable  measure\n\nas applied  against a contract  guarantor or surety.   Confronted\n\nwith the prospect that its contingent  claim for reimbursement or\n\ncontribution  against a chapter 7 debtor estate may be subject to\n\ndisallowance under  section 502(e)(1)(B), an entity  may elect to\n\ncause its contingent  contract claim to  become \"fixed\" prior  to\n\ndisallowance, see Bankruptcy Code   502(e)(2), by itself satisfy-\n                 \n\ning the debt due the creditor  of the debtor estate, leaving  the\n\nentity as the sole holder of a claim against the  estate based on\n\nthat debt.7  See, e.g., In re Baldwin-United Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1543573\"><a href=\"/opinion/1543573/matter-of-baldwin-united-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span>  <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                                  \n\n                    \n\n     7Section 502(e)(2) provides:\n\n     A claim  for reimbursement  or contribution of  such an\n     entity that becomes fixed after the commencement of the\n     case shall  be determined,  and shall be  allowed under\n\n                                15\n\n895 (Bankr.

On  the other  hand, the  section\n\n502(e)(2)  \"fixing\"  option  presents  an   especially  difficult\n\ndilemma for an owner or operator of a  targeted facility, such as\n\nJuniper,  involved  in  a  Superfund contribution  action.

If the EPA\n\nopts  to refrain from participating  in any distribution from the\n\nchapter 7 estate, as  it may do simply  by not filing a proof  of\n\nclaim,  Juniper may end up as the only potential EPA enforcement-\n\naction target still left standing and  solvent.8  Thus, sometimes\n\n                    \n\n     subsection (a), (b),  or (c) of this section, or disal-\n     lowed under subsection (d) of this section, the same as\n     if such claim had  become fixed before the date  of the\n     filing of the petition.\n\n11 U.S.C.   502(e)(2).\n\n     8EPA  enforcement actions  generally are  excepted  from the\nautomatic stay  provisions.

In the present case, therefore, the chapter 7 trustee was\n\nrequired to come forward with substantial evidence that Juniper's\n\nclaim is one for CERCLA \"contribution,\" which would implicate two\n\nrelated questions:  (1) whether Hemingway-Bristol is contingently\n\n\"liable\"  to the EPA for  future response costs,  and (2) whether\n\nJuniper is \"liable\" to the EPA on the same \"debt.\"\n\n     4.   Hemingway-Bristol \"Liability\" on Joint Obligation.\n                                                           \n\n          At  the time it  allowed Juniper's claim  for past res-\n                                                            \n\nponse  costs,  the bankruptcy  court  determined  that Hemingway-\n\nBristol  had  owned or  operated  the facility  when  the passive\n\n\"disposal\" of  hazardous substances occurred  and that Hemingway-\n\n                                19\n\nBristol  had  actual knowledge  of  the presence  of  the leaking\n\nbarrels.  Hence, Hemingway-Bristol is a \"covered person,\" strict-\n\nly  liable to the  EPA for future  response costs  pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C.   9607(a)(4)(A).\n\n          Juniper  nonetheless  suggests  that  the  term \"liable\n\nwith\" should  be interpreted in light of the singular legislative\n\npurpose  underlying the  section  502(e)(1)(B)  contingent  claim\n\ndisallowance provision.   Like any other  claim for contribution,\n\nsays Juniper,  its claim for  future CERCLA response  costs could\n\npose  no  \"double-dipping\"  threat  were the  EPA,  for  whatever\n\nreason, not to participate in any distribution from the chapter 7\n\nestate.   Moreover, the  EPA has elected  not to  assert a  claim\n\nagainst the  estate, despite  considerable  prodding by  Juniper.\n\nRather, the EPA repeatedly has manifested its intention to forego\n\nany  immediate claim  against the  chapter 7  estate in  favor of\n\nadministrative enforcement  actions against  other PRPs,  such as\n\nJuniper.9   The  trustee responds  that  the literal  language of\n\nsection  502(e)(1)(B)  directs  disallowance  of  the  codebtor's\n\n[Juniper's] contingent  claim even though the  creditor [EPA] has\n\nnot filed  a proof of claim  by the time the  codebtor's claim is\n\nconsidered for allowance.\n\n          Section 502(e)(1) directs disallowance  of the claim of\n\na  codebtor who  is liable  with the  debtor on  the \"claim  of a\n                                            \n\n                    \n\n     9In a May 1987 letter to  Juniper, the EPA suggested that it\nhad already exercised its discretion to refrain from asserting an\nenforcement action against the  chapter 7 estate, at least  as of\nthat time.  Two years later, however, the EPA sent PRP notices to\nHemingway and Bristol.\n\n                                20\n\ncreditor.\"   The pivotal terms     \"claim\" and  \"creditor\"    are\n\ndefined.  A \"claim\" is  a \"right to payment, whether or  not such\n                                \n\nright is reduced  to judgment,  liquidated, unliquidated,  fixed,\n\ncontingent,  matured,  unmatured,  disputed,  undisputed,  legal,\n\nequitable, secured, or unsecured.\"   Bankruptcy Code   101(4), 11\n\nU.S.C.    101(4) (emphasis  added).

Under Bankruptcy Rules 3004 and\n3005(a),  the trustee and Juniper normally would have only thirty\ndays  from  the bar  date to  file their  surrogate claims.

On\n\nremand, the  bankruptcy court  should prescribe a  reasonable bar\n\ndate by which the chapter 7  trustee must elect whether to file a\n\nsurrogate EPA claim pursuant to Bankruptcy Code   501(c), without\n\nprejudice to  Juniper's right to  submit a surrogate  claim under\n\nsubsection  502(b)  as well.15   Should  the  trustee not  file a\n\ntimely surrogate  claim  (and  should Juniper  not  do  so),  the\n\nsection 502(e)(1)(B) objection should be dismissed, and the court\n\nshould  estimate Juniper's  direct  claim against  the chapter  7\n\nestate  pursuant  to  normal  claim-allowance  procedures.

A similar problem may arise if any superseding proof\nof claim filed by EPA were to  understate (in Juniper's view) the\nchapter 7  debtors' share of  the CERCLA obligation.   We  do not\nconstrue  subsections  501(b)  and  (c) as  suggesting  that  the\ntrustee could  preempt a  surrogate  EPA claim  by Juniper  under\nsection  501(b)  asserting that  the  chapter  7 estate's  CERCLA\nliability to EPA is  greater than that asserted in  the trustee's\nsection  501(c) surrogate  claim.

In Reading, several business firms,\n                                        \nwhose premises were damaged  by a fire negligently caused  by the\nreceiver appointed  to operate  a Chapter XI  business, requested\nthat their fire-loss claims be allowed as administrative expenses\nof  the  Chapter XI  estate,  notwithstanding the  fact  that the\nlosses sustained as a result of the fire resulted in no \"benefit\"\nto  the  Chapter XI  estate.    Noting the  \"decisive,  statutory\nobjective [of] fairness to all persons  having claims against the\ninsolvent,\" Reading, 391 U.S. at 477, the Supreme Court held that\n                   \nthe  claims for postpetition fire loss were allowable as costs of\nadministration.  Its  rationale was equitable  in nature:   unse-\ncured creditors  in a  Chapter XI reorganization  anticipate that\ntheir agreement to defer receipt of payment  on their prepetition\nclaims   may  facilitate  the  reorganization  debtor's  ultimate\nrehabilitation, thereby enhancing their prospects for recovery on\ntheir prepetition claims.   Unlike holders of prepetition claims,\nhowever, the firms  whose business premises  were damaged by  the\npostpetition  fire negligently  caused by  the receiver  had \"the\ninsolvent business [involuntarily] thrust upon them  by operation\nof law.\"  Id.

Thus\n                                          \ninterpreted, Reading  might permit Juniper to  recover the entire\n                    \ncost of  its extant \"injury\"     or the past and  future costs of\nremediation    despite the fact that  it has yet to incur some of\nthese  response costs.

There is  no record evidence\n\nthat the  estate either  contracted away  its obligation  to con-\n\ntribute, or  bargained for a right to  indemnification from Juni-\n\nper.   See  42 U.S.C.    9607(e) (purported  transfers of  CERCLA\n          \n\nliability cannot exonerate transferor, but indemnification agree-\n\nments are permissible).   Similarly, to the extent that  the $1.6\n\nmillion purchase price for  the facility presumptively  reflected\n\nthe parties'  allocation of the risks relating to these contribu-\n\ntion costs, the $1.6 million constituted \"consideration\" support-\n\ning  Juniper's right  to  payment for  contribution for  response\n\ncosts from the  estate.  Obviously, this  substantial infusion of\n\ncash benefitted the chapter 11 rehabilitation effort.  Thus,  the\n\n$1.6 million  in purchase monies constituted  the requisite base-\n\nline  \"consideration\" for  Juniper's right  to  contribution; and\n\nresponse costs subsequently incurred by Juniper a mere maturation\n\nof that right, immaterial for Mammoth Mart purposes. \n                                          \n\n          On the  other hand, we agree that Mammoth Mart priority\n                                                        \n\nis unavailing to Juniper insofar as its right to contribution for\n\nfuture  response costs remains \"contingent\" at the time the bank-\n\n                                32\n\nruptcy court considers Juniper's  claim for allowance against the\n\ndebtor  estate.

Even  though  Juniper's  post-\n\npetition contribution  claim, once allowed, would  be entitled to\n                                          \n\npriority  treatment under  section 503(b), the  parallel restric-\n\ntions in section 502(e)(1)(B)  pose an additional hurdle.   Under\n\nits clear terms, section  502(e)(1)(B) does not apply exclusively\n\nto  \"creditors,\" or  in other  words, to  holders of  prepetition\n                                                                 \n\nclaims for reimbursement  or contribution.  Section  502(e)(1)(B)\n\nrefers  to  the holder  of the  claim as  an  \"entity,\" not  as a\n\n\"creditor\"  of the  estate.18   Accordingly,  Juniper's  priority\n\n\"claim for  reimbursement or contribution\" would  be allowable if\n\neither:  (1) Juniper and the chapter 11  estate are not strictly,\n      \n\njointly, and severally liable  (\"liable with the debtor\") on  the\n\nEPA debt under the liability provisions of the CERCLA statute, or\n                                                                 \n\n(2)  Juniper's response  costs have  become \"fixed\"  and \"actual\"\n\n(i.e., have been expended by Juniper for remediation or paid over\n     \n\nto the EPA) by the time  Juniper's claim is considered for disal-\n\nlowance.

We turn, therefore, to the question of Juniper's alleged\n\nliability to the EPA.\n\n          The threshold  question is whether Juniper  is even as-\n\nserting  a direct CERCLA claim  against the chapter  7 estate, or\n                 \n\nmerely a derivative claim  for \"contribution\" from the chapter  7\n                   \n\nestate.

On  the other  hand, the bankruptcy  court found  that\n\"none of  the interested parties, including  the Trustee, Juniper\nand the two  courts that approved the sale,  were apprised of the\npresence of hazardous  wastes on the  property, despite the  DEQE\naction.\"  In re Hemingway Transp., 73 B.R. at 501-02.\n                                 \n\n     24The  EPA  informed Juniper  in May  1987 that  its alleged\ncontribution to the passive disposal was undetermined because the\nextent of the  post-1983 \"contaminant plume\" at the  facility had\nyet to be ascertained.\n\n                                39\n\ncent landowner\"  defense, for several reasons:   Juniper (1) knew\n\nin 1983  that the facility was in close proximity (200 feet) to a\n\nlarger Superfund  site already included on  the national priority\n\nlist;  (2) made no preacquisition inquiry of EPA or DEQE concern-\n\ning  possible contamination in the  area; and (3)  did not obtain\n\navailable maps  showing an unpaved  access road to  the allegedly\n\ninaccessible portion of the facility where the drums were found.\n\n          The EPA  opinion is  not necessarily dispositive  as to\n\nthe allowability of a claim or an administrative expense request.\n\nNevertheless, after  trial on the issue  of Hemingway's liability\n\nfor  past response  costs, the  bankruptcy court  noted (notwith-\n\nstanding  Juniper's contention that the drums  were located in an\n\narea which was inaccessible  at the time of  the 1983 sale)  that\n\n\"easy access to the location of the barrels is possible along the\n            \n\nCity  of  Woburn's  sewer  easement,  which  parallels  the  MBTA\n\ntracks.\"  In  re Hemingway  Transp.,  108 B.R.  at  380 (emphasis\n                                   \n\nadded).  The record further suggests that Juniper, an experienced\n\nland  developer in the Woburn  area, may have  been familiar with\n\nthe environmental risks posed by its acquisition of the facility,\n\nand  therefore may  have  been cognizant  that  the $1.6  million\n\npurchase price  reflected a discount  due to contamination.

Should the bankruptcy court find that Juniper did not have\n\nnotice  or actual knowledge of  the contamination at  the time it\n\npurchased  the facility  in 1983,  Juniper's  claim for  past and\n\n                                41\n\nfuture  response  costs  should  be estimated25  and  allowed  as\n\nadministrative  expenses entitled  to priority.26   On  the other\n\nhand,  if Juniper did not  take all appropriate  steps to protect\n\nitself from CERCLA liability, its lack of diligence exposed it to\n\nthe  harsh consequences  of strict,  joint and  several liability\n\n                    \n\n     25Because of  its earlier  section 502(e) disallowance,  the\nbankruptcy court refused to  permit Juniper to introduce evidence\nof anticipated future cleanup costs.  Although we need not decide\nthe issue at  this juncture,  we note that  the EPA's  nonbinding\npreliminary  allocation  of  responsibility may  be  inadmissible\nevidence as to the  value of Juniper's claim for  future response\ncosts, see 42 U.S.C.   9622(e)(3)(C) (\"The nonbinding preliminary\n          \nallocation of responsibility shall  not be admissible as evidence\nin  any proceeding  . . .  [nor] constitute  an apportionment  or\nother statement on the divisibility of harm or causation.\"), and,\non remand, that  it may be incumbent on  Juniper to present other\nevidence of the extent of its \"injury.\"\n\n     26The determination of  Juniper's CERCLA \"liability\" by  the\nbankruptcy court is required solely for purposes of the allowance\nor disallowance of Juniper's proof of claim, a core proceeding in\nbankruptcy, and  the court cannot ignore the possibility that the\nEPA might  yet maintain  a successful enforcement  action against\nJuniper.   But  unlike  the holder  of  a prepetition  claim  for\n                                                     \ncontribution,  which normally must await final distribution under\nBankruptcy Code    726, Juniper would enjoy  a distinct distribu-\ntional advantage  should it succeed in  establishing its entitle-\nment  to the  \"innocent  landowner\" defense  under section  9607-\n(b)(3).

Juniper's Appeal: Disallowance of\n     Attorney Fees (42 U.S.C.   9607(a)).\n                                        \n\n          Juniper argues  for an award of  attorney fees pursuant\n\nto 42 U.S.C.   9607(a)(4)(B), which makes no reference to \"attor-\n\nney fees\"  in private  cost recovery  actions.   Juniper contends\n\nthat  the term  \"necessary costs of  response\" should  be broadly\n\nconstrued  to encompass  attorney  fee awards  so  as to  advance\n\nCERCLA's  remedial  purposes by  inducing  PRPs  to cooperate  in\n\ninitiating  prompt cleanup  efforts.   We affirm  on  the grounds\n\nadvanced  in the well-reasoned district court opinion.

The bankruptcy court ruled that Juniper's\n\nCERCLA liability  resulted from its postpetition  purchase of the\n\nfacility from Hemingway-Bristol, debtor in possession, during the\n\ncourse  of the chapter 11 proceeding.  The bankruptcy court found\n\nthat it would be  fundamentally \"unfair\" not to allow  Juniper to\n\n                    \n\n     27Prior  to  admitting  Juniper's  attorney  fee billing  in\nevidence, the bankruptcy judge stated:  \"[A]ssuming  only for the\nmoment  that  legal services  are  a compensable  item  of damage\n[under CERCLA], then aren't  all reasonable fees incurred by  the\nplaintiff  resulting  from  the  alleged harm,  aren't  they  all\ncompensable? . . .

It is impossi-\nble to determine with  reasonable confidence whether the attorney\nfees incurred  by Juniper were reasonably  \"necessary\" to facili-\ntate  its compliance  with  the EPA  administrative order,  or to\ndiscover  the existence or whereabouts of other PRPs who might be\namenable to suit by Juniper in an action for contribution.\n\n                                45\n\nreceive  payment of  its contribution claim  in advance  of other\n\ncreditors.

As concerns Juniper's claim for\n\nCERCLA  response  costs previously  incurred, its  entitlement to\n\npriority  does not  hinge  on the  court's  determination of  the\n\nmerits  of  Juniper's  \"innocent  landowner\" defense.    Even  if\n\nJuniper and  the Hemingway-Bristol estate are  co-\"liable\" on the\n\nEPA  debt, Juniper's claim  for past  response costs  escapes the\n\nsection  502(e)(1)(B)  co-liability  problem encountered  by  its\n\nclaim  for  future response  costs,  because  Juniper's right  to\n\npayment  for past  response costs  became \"fixed\"  upon Juniper's\n\nincurrence of  actual and necessary  response costs prior  to the\n\ntime its claim was considered for  allowance.  On the other hand,\n\nif Juniper and  the estate are  not co-\"liable\" on the  EPA debt,\n\nbecause  Juniper  has the  benefit  of  the \"innocent  landowner\"\n\ndefense, both its  past and future response costs are recoverable\n\nas priority administrative expenses  under either Mammoth Mart or\n                                                              \n\nReading.\n       \n\n                               III\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n                                46\n\n          We vacate the  bankruptcy court's section  502(e)(1)(B)\n\ndisallowance of  Juniper's claim for  future response costs.

Should the trustee file a timely surrogate\n\nclaim,  and  should  Juniper  choose to  press  for  simultaneous\n\nallowance  of  its so-called  \"direct\"  claim,  the court  should\n\ndetermine  whether  Juniper would  be  entitled  to an  \"innocent\n\nlandowner\"  defense  pursuant to  42  U.S.C.    9601(35)(B).   If\n\nJuniper is  so entitled, its  claim for \"contribution\"  should be\n\nallowed  as an administrative expense.   If not  so entitled, its\n\nclaim  should be disallowed unless  and until Juniper \"fixes\" its\n\nright  to contribution  by actually  incurring any  such response\n\ncosts by the time its claim  is considered for allowance.
