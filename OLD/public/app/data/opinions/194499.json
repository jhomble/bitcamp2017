Rather than such a sleight of\n\nhand, the defendants contend, \"this Court should itself have\n\ndetermined as a matter of law whether or not the actions of\n\nDefendant Cole, on the facts of this case, were objectively\n                                                           \n\nreasonable thereby entitling Cole to summary judgment . . .\" Id. \n                                                                \n\n(emphasis in original)\n\n            \n\n*Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n\n     The problem with the defendants' argument is that the\n\nsummary judgment motion record in this unusual case did not\n\npermit the District Court or this Court to make such a\n\ndetermination as a matter of law.  The fountainhead of\n\nsubstantive due process jurisprudence as applied to unwanted\n\nmanipulations of an individual's body, Rochin v. California, 342\n                                                           \n\nU.S. 165 (1952), cautioned against making \n\n          due process of law a matter of judicial\n          caprice.  The faculties of the Due Process\n          Clause may be indefinite and vague, but the\n          mode of their ascertainment is not self-\n          willed.  In each case \"due process of law\"\n          requires an evaluation based on a\n          disinterested inquiry pursued in the spirit\n          of science, on a balanced order of facts\n          exactly and fairly stated, on the detached\n          consideration of conflicting claims, on a\n          judgment not ad hoc and episodic but duly\n                             \n          mindful of reconciling the needs both of\n          continuity and of change in a progressive\n          society.\n\nId. at 172.\n   \n\n     The Supreme Court has continued to rely in this area upon\n\nfull record development as a predicate to judgment.  That\n\napproach was illustrated in the fact-intensive analysis provided\n\nby the court in its most recent treatment of the \"multifacted\n\nlegal inquiry that the court must undertake\" in addressing the\n\nproblem of nonconsensual manipulations of an individual's body. \n\nWinston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753, 764 n. 8 (1985).\n              \n\n     The task of the fact finder as to liability in this case\n\nupon remand will be two fold.  First, it must be determined\n\n                                2\n\nwhether the use of a plethysmograph in this setting would have\n\nbeen a constitutionally impermissible intrusion upon the\n\nplaintiff's bodily integrity.  Second, if the answer to the first\n\nquestion is \"Yes,\" the factfinder must also answer the question\n\nwhether a public official in defendant Cole's position could\n\nreasonably have believed when he made submission to the\n\nplethysmograph a condition of reemployment that this would not be\n\nan impermissible intrusion on Harrington's bodily integrity.  It\n\nis only if both questions are answered affirmatively that\n\ndefendant Cole can be held liable.  Those answers by the fact\n\nfinder will ultimately, of course, be subject to judicial\n\nsupervision on matters of law.\n\n     However, the record assembled on the motion for summary\n\njudgment was insufficient to provide an adequate basis for\n\nanswering these questions at this point \"as a matter of law.\" \n\nThe jurisprudence of nonconsensual bodily manipulations has\n\ndeveloped cautiously and only after full understanding of the\n\nunderlying facts and relevant context.  In the absence of such\n\ndevelopment here judgment on the underlying questions would be\n\npremature.\n\n     Accordingly, the petition for rehearing of\n\ndefendants/appellees is hereby \n\n                              Denied\n                                    \n\n                                3\n",
