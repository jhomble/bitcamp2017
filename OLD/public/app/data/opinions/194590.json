In this appeal, plaintiff seeks review\n                    \n\nof a carefully  and fully developed decision of  the district\n\ncourt  rendered  after a  bench  trial.   After  ruling  that\n\nplaintiff's  lease had  been violated by  defendant's illegal\n\nexclusion  of plaintiff  from the  premises, the  court found\n\nthat  plaintiff had suffered no  damages as a  result of that\n\noccurrence, but  that defendant  had suffered damages  in the\n\namount of sixty dollars  for past due rent and  seven hundred\n\ndollars for exterminating services made necessary  because of\n\nplaintiff's inadequate  housekeeping.  The  court also  found\n\nthat certain  other claims brought by  plaintiff were lacking\n\nin any substance. \n\n          Plaintiff's objections  on appeal are based  on his\n\nchallenges to factual determinations  of the court, which, of\n\ncourse,  are  accepted  unless  demonstrated to  be  \"clearly\n\nerroneous.\"  See  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 52(a).   Having  carefully\n                \n\nreviewed  the record on  appeal and the  objections raised by\n\nplaintiff, we  are not persuaded that the court clearly erred\n\nin  making  the determinations  at  issue.   Accordingly,  we\n\naffirm based on the well-reasoned district court opinion.  \n\n          Affirmed.
