In the last analysis,  however, the\n\nappeal  does  not  turn  on  matters  of  either  ichthyology  or\n\nliterature, but on pedestrian  principles of procedural  default.\n\nWe conclude that, on  the facts of this case,  the raise-or-waive\n\nrule must be  applied strictly, and, consequently,  we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal  of appellants' petition for  judicial\n\nreview.\n\n                                I\n\n                       The Tale of the Tail\n                                           \n\n          On  April 28, 1989,  in San  Juan, Puerto  Rico, Mahlon\n\nPickering,  an agent  of the  National Marine  Fisheries Service,\n\nobserved  the severed  tail  of a  large  fish hanging  from  the\n\nrigging  of the  F/V  EAGLE EYE.   The  agent boarded  the craft,\n\ninterrogated a  crew member, inspected the  caudal appendage, and\n\nlaunched the  investigation that led NOAA to  charge the vessel's\n\nowner,  petitioner-appellant Eagle  Eye Fishing  Corporation, and\n\nits captain, petitioner-appellant Bruce Beebe, under the Magnuson\n\nFishery Conservation  and Management  Act of  1976, 16 U.S.c.    \n\n1801-1882  (1988),  and  the  regulations   promulgated  pursuant\n\n                    \n\n     1See Ernest Hemingway,  The Old  Man and the  Sea 99  (Chas.\n                                                      \nScribner's Sons 1952) (describing the marlin tail as \"higher than\na big scythe blade and  a very pale lavender above the  dark blue\nwater\").\n\n                                3\n\nthereto,  see  50  C.F.R.      644.7(d),  644.22  (1990).2    The\n             \n\nregulations prohibit not only capture,  but mere possession, of a\n\nbillfish  such  as  a  blue  marlin  shoreward  of this  nation's\n\nexclusive economic zone (EEZ).3\n\n          Appellants denied  the charges.  Though  able to afford\n\ncounsel,  they   chose  to   appear  pro   se   at  the   ensuing\n\nadministrative hearing.   They did not  object when the  vessel's\n\nlogbook  was introduced into evidence.   By like  token, they did\n\nnot controvert expert testimony that, assuming a Caribbean catch,\n\nthe tail could only belong to a blue marlin.  Instead, appellants\n\nargued that NOAA  could not  prove with the  requisite degree  of\n\nprobability  that  the  tail  found  aboard  appellants'   vessel\n\nbelonged  to a marlin caught in Caribbean waters.  They suggested\n\nthat the tail perhaps belonged to a black marlin.4\n\n          The administrative law judge  (ALJ) found that the fish\n\nhad  been snagged in Caribbean waters frequented by the blue (but\n\n                    \n\n     2Former section  644.7(d) is now  recodified as 50  C.F.R.  \n644.7(e) (1993).\n\n     3To be precise, the regulations proscribe possession of such\na  billfish \"by  a vessel with  a pelagic  longline or  drift net\naboard or harvested by gear other than rod and reel,\" 50 C.F.R.  \n644.7(d) (1990),  \"shoreward of the  outer boundary of  the EEZ,\"\nid.    644.22.  The regulations delineate the EEZ as that span of\n   \nthe  sea from  the shoreward  boundary of  each coastal  state to\npoints 200 nautical miles from the \"baseline,\" or low water line,\nalong the  state's coast.  See 50 C.F.R.   620.2; see also Thomas\n                                                          \nJ.  Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime  Law   2-4,  at 26 (1987).\nAppellants do  not dispute  that the  F/V EAGLE  EYE is a  vessel\nsubject to 50 C.F.R.   644.7(d).   Similarly, they do not dispute\nthat San Juan Harbor lies within this nation's EEZ.\n\n     4The black  marlin is  an unprotected species  indigenous to\nthe Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.\n\n                                4\n\nnot the black) marlin.   He rested that determination  on several\n\npieces of evidence, including, inter alia, (1) the logbook, which\n                                         \n\nverified the  vessel's coordinates at  all relevant times;  (2) a\n\nswordfishing permit, which generally defined the vessel's fishing\n\narea; (3)  testimony  of a  crew  member regarding  the  vessel's\n\nlocation  during the  voyage; and  (4) Agent  Pickering's opinion\n\nthat the fish seemed to have been caught only a day or two before\n\nthe  ship had docked, or,  stated differently, four  to five days\n\nbefore  he  first  observed  it.     Based  principally  on  this\n\ndetermination as to  the situs of the catch, the ALJ decided that\n\nthe tail belonged to a blue marlin and fined appellants $5,250.\n\n          Appellants secured counsel and filed a petition seeking\n\nfurther administrative review, see  15 C.F.R.   904.273.   In the\n                                  \n\ncourse  of that review, appellants for the first time argued that\n\nNOAA  violated its  own confidentiality  regulations by  publicly\n\ndisclosing  information  contained in  the  logbook.5   The  NOAA\n\nAdministrator equivocated about the  merits of this argument, but\n\nconcluded  that,  in  all  events, appellants  were  barred  from\n\nadvancing it because they had not raised it before the ALJ.6\n\n                    \n\n     5Logbooks of this type must be kept as a matter of course by\nall  regulated  fishing  vessels,  and the  vessels  must  record\ncertain specified information therein.  See 50 C.F.R.   603.  The\n                                           \ninformation  is  gathered  for  use  in  the  agency's  fisheries\nmanagement  program and  is to  be held  in confidence,  see id.,\n                                                                \nsubject to certain specified exceptions, see, e.g.,  50 C.F.R.   \n                                                  \n603.5, 603.7.\n\n     6The  Administrator  based  his   finding  of  waiver  on  a\nprocedural regulation providing that:\n\n          Issues of  fact or law not  argued before the\n          [ALJ] may not be raised on review unless they\n\n                                5\n\n          Appellants then  sought judicial review pursuant  to 16\n\nU.S.C.    1861(d).  In their complaint, they again challenged the\n\nuse of the logbook  at the administrative hearing.   The district\n\ncourt dealt appellants a double blow; the court upheld the agency\n\ndetermination  on  the ground  of  procedural  default, and  also\n\nconcluded  that, wholly  apart  from the  logbook, there  existed\n\nample evidence  to underbrace  the ALJ's finding  that appellants\n\nunlawfully possessed a blue  marlin within the EEZ.   This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                II\n\n                         Troubled Waters\n                                        \n\n          The doctrine  of administrative  waiver is a  subset of\n\nthe broader  doctrine of  procedural default.   It teaches  that,\n\n\"[i]n the usual  administrative law  case, a court  ought not  to\n\nconsider  points  which were  not  seasonably  raised before  the\n\nagency.\"  Massachusetts  Dep't of  Pub. Welfare  v. Secretary  of\n                                                                 \n\nAgric., 984 F.2d 514, 523 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 81\n                                                  \n\n(1993).   This  doctrine  serves a  variety  of worthwhile  ends,\n\nincluding  judicial economy,  agency  autonomy, and  accuracy  of\n\nresult.7\n\n                    \n\n          were raised for the first time in the initial\n          decision, or could  not reasonably have  been\n          foreseen and raised by the parties during the\n          hearing.\n\n15 C.F.R.   904.273(d).\n\n     7These interests are similar, but not identical, to the main\ninterests  underlying the  concept of  administrative exhaustion.\nSee,  e.g., Ezratty v. Puerto  Rico, 648 F.2d  770, 774 (1st Cir.\n                                   \n1981);  United States  v. Newmann,  478 F.2d  829, 831  (8th Cir.\n                                 \n\n                                6\n\n          To be  sure, the general rule  of administrative waiver\n\nis  ringed with exceptions.   See Massachusetts DPW,  984 F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n524.  Appellants seek to invoke one such exception, applicable to\n\nsignificant questions of law, especially those  of constitutional\n\nmagnitude which are  not only likely to arise again  but also are\n\nsusceptible  to resolution  on the  existing record.   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States  v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir. 1990)\n                            \n\n(developing  this exception in  the context of  an analogous rule\n\ninvolving an appellate court's  treatment of questions not raised\n\nin  the trial court).  In furtherance of this attempt, appellants\n\nassert that  their  confidentiality argument  is substantive  and\n\nbears on NOAA's central  mission of fisheries management, raising\n\nthe  specter  that the  agency's  misuse  of routinely  collected\n\ninformation could drive fishermen to  falsify their records.   We\n\nare unpersuaded.   If  the NOAA Administrator  shared appellants'\n\nfear,   then   he  could   have   reached  out   to   decide  the\n\nconfidentiality  issue on  administrative review  as a  matter of\n\ndiscretion.   The fact that he did not  do so speaks volumes.  We\n\nadd, moreover,  that appellants come nowhere  near satisfying the\n\nother requirements  of the  La Guardia  exception.   For example,\n                                      \n\nthere is no reason to think that this question will recur   after\n\nall, it apparently  has not arisen on  any other occasion in  the\n\nseventeen-year  history of the Magnuson  Act   and,  at any rate,\n\n                    \n\n1973); see also Massachusetts DPW, 984  F.2d at 523 n.8.  This is\n                                 \nas  it should  be,  for both  rules  are aimed  at  assuring full\ndevelopment of fact and law at the agency level.\n\n                                7\n\nthe question cannotconfidently be resolvedon the existingrecord.8\n\n          Appellants have a second hook on their line.  They tell\n\nus that they proceeded pro se before the ALJ, represented only by\n\na  corporate  officer    and  the  officer  could  not have  been\n\nexpected to understand the  significance of admitting the logbook\n\ninto evidence.   Appellants view this  circumstance as sufficient\n\nto justify an exception to the administrative waiver rule, either\n\nbecause,  in  general, the  absence  of  counsel should  insulate\n\nparties from the  usual strictures  of the rule,  or because,  in\n\nparticular,  appellants  should  be  found  to  come  within  the\n\nregulatory  exception that permits a new argument to be raised if\n\nit \"could not  reasonably have been foreseen\" at  the time of the\n\ninitial hearing, 15 C.F.R.   904.273(d), quoted supra note 6.  We\n                                                     \n\nfind neither of these theorems to be convincing.\n\n          A pro se litigant,  like any litigant, is guaranteed  a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to be heard.  See Logan v. Zimmerman Brush\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     8The  government   denies  that  its  use   of  the  logbook\ntransgressed the confidentiality regulation.  To the contrary, it\nasserts  that all individuals  who had  access to  the statistics\nfell  within the confidentiality exemptions permitting disclosure\nto federal  employees responsible for monitoring  and enforcement\nof fisheries management plans, as well as to other NOAA personnel\non a need-to-know basis.  See 50 C.F.R.   603.5.   The government\n                             \nalso argues that limited use of otherwise confidential data, such\nas  logbook information,  is frequently  allowed for  purposes of\nenforcement  proceedings in  federal  courts,  see, e.g.,  United\n                                                                 \nStates v.

The\n                              \nadministrative  record  is  not  sufficiently  well developed  to\nenable   enlightened  resolution   of  these   contentions      a\ncircumstance   which,  in  itself,   militates  strongly  against\nexcusing appellants' administrative waiver.\n\n                                8\n\nCo.,  455 U.S. 422, 437  (1982).  While  courts have historically\n   \n\nloosened  the  reins for  pro se  parties,  see, e.g.,  Haines v.\n                                                              \n\nKerner,  404  U.S. 519,  520-21  (1972)  (suggesting that  courts\n      \n\nshould construe  a pro se litigant's  pleadings with liberality),\n\nthe \"right of self-representation is not `a license not to comply\n\nwith relevant rules of procedural and substantive law.'\"  Andrews\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Appellants\n\nsimply appear to  have been  penny wise and  pound foolish;  they\n\nknowingly   chose   to  handle   their  own   defense,  forsaking\n\nprofessional assistance; they lost; and no miscarriage of justice\n\nlooms.    Consequently,  appellants  must  reap  the  predictable\n\nharvest of their procedural default.\n\n          We give short shrift to appellants'  claim that, due to\n\ntheir  pro se  status,  the confidentiality  argument \"could  not\n\nreasonably  have   been  foreseen   and  raised,\"  15   C.F.R.   \n\n904.273(d), during the initial round of hearings.  The  exception\n\nlimned in  this regulation is a narrow one.  It should be applied\n\nsparingly.  And, moreover, foreseeability in this context must be\n\njudged according to  a standard of objective reasonableness.  Cf.\n                                                                 \n\nJorgensen  v. Massachusetts Port  Auth., 905  F.2d 515,  521 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1990) (explaining, in  the tort context, that foreseeability\n\nshould be judged by means of a similar standard).  Hence, parties\n\nwho choose  to represent  themselves must be  held to  anticipate\n\nwhat  trained  counsel would  ordinarily  anticipate.   In  other\n\nwords, if a reasonably well-prepared litigant could have foreseen\n\nan  issue, and would have raised it, then the exception contained\n\nin the regulation does not pertain.  So it is here.\n\n                               III\n\n                      An Anchor to Windward\n                                           \n\n          Before  ending our  voyage, we  add that any  error was\n\nharmless.    We  have  carefully  reviewed  the  record  and  are\n\nconfident that  suppression  of the  logbook  would have  had  no\n\n                                10\n\neffect  on the outcome of  the proceeding.   Although the logbook\n\nentries  comprise  the  only evidence  establishing  the  precise\n                                                                 \n\nlocation of the F/V EAGLE EYE, the record makes manifest that the\n\nagency's case depends  upon the general  location of the  vessel,\n                                       \n\nnot its exact longitude and latitude  at any given moment.  Here,\n\nsubstantial evidence apart  from the logbook  entries establishes\n\nbeyond serious hope of  contradiction that the vessel was  in the\n\nCaribbean at the  time it caught the fish to  which the offending\n\ntail was once attached.   That evidence, without more,  was fully\n\nsufficient to  confirm the species of fish  and, consequently, to\n\nwarrant a finding that the regulations had been infringed.\n\n                                IV\n\n                 The Tail of the Tale of the Tail\n                                                 \n\n          We  need  go  no  further.    In many  respects,  these\n\nproceedings  parallel  Hemingway's  novella.    Before  the  ALJ,\n\nappellants \"tried not to  think but only to endure.\"   Hemingway,\n\nsupra, at 50.  On administrative review, they acted as if \"[e]ach\n     \n\ntime was  a new  time.\"   Id. at  73.   But these apothegms  make\n                             \n\nbetter sense on the open  sea than they do in open court.   Here,\n\nat  long last,  appellants  must recognize  that, in  Hemingway's\n\nwords, they are  \"beaten now finally and without remedy.\"  Id. at\n                                                              \n\n131.

In the last analysis,  however, the\n\nappeal  does  not  turn  on  matters  of  either  ichthyology  or\n\nliterature, but on pedestrian  principles of procedural  default.\n\nWe conclude that, on  the facts of this case,  the raise-or-waive\n\nrule must be  applied strictly, and, consequently,  we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal  of appellants' petition for  judicial\n\nreview.\n\n                                I\n\n                       The Tale of the Tail\n                                           \n\n          On  April 28, 1989,  in San  Juan, Puerto  Rico, Mahlon\n\nPickering,  an agent  of the  National Marine  Fisheries Service,\n\nobserved  the severed  tail  of a  large  fish hanging  from  the\n\nrigging  of the  F/V  EAGLE EYE.   The  agent boarded  the craft,\n\ninterrogated a  crew member, inspected the  caudal appendage, and\n\nlaunched the  investigation that led NOAA to  charge the vessel's\n\nowner,  petitioner-appellant Eagle  Eye Fishing  Corporation, and\n\nits captain, petitioner-appellant Bruce Beebe, under the Magnuson\n\nFishery Conservation  and Management  Act of  1976, 16 U.S.c.    \n\n1801-1882  (1988),  and  the  regulations   promulgated  pursuant\n\n                    \n\n     1See Ernest Hemingway,  The Old  Man and the  Sea 99  (Chas.\n                                                      \nScribner's Sons 1952) (describing the marlin tail as \"higher than\na big scythe blade and  a very pale lavender above the  dark blue\nwater\").\n\n                                3\n\nthereto,  see  50  C.F.R.      644.7(d),  644.22  (1990).2    The\n             \n\nregulations prohibit not only capture,  but mere possession, of a\n\nbillfish  such  as  a  blue  marlin  shoreward  of this  nation's\n\nexclusive economic zone (EEZ).3\n\n          Appellants denied  the charges.  Though  able to afford\n\ncounsel,  they   chose  to   appear  pro   se   at  the   ensuing\n\nadministrative hearing.   They did not  object when the  vessel's\n\nlogbook  was introduced into evidence.   By like  token, they did\n\nnot controvert expert testimony that, assuming a Caribbean catch,\n\nthe tail could only belong to a blue marlin.  Instead, appellants\n\nargued that NOAA  could not  prove with the  requisite degree  of\n\nprobability  that  the  tail  found  aboard  appellants'   vessel\n\nbelonged  to a marlin caught in Caribbean waters.  They suggested\n\nthat the tail perhaps belonged to a black marlin.4\n\n          The administrative law judge  (ALJ) found that the fish\n\nhad  been snagged in Caribbean waters frequented by the blue (but\n\n                    \n\n     2Former section  644.7(d) is now  recodified as 50  C.F.R.  \n644.7(e) (1993).\n\n     3To be precise, the regulations proscribe possession of such\na  billfish \"by  a vessel with  a pelagic  longline or  drift net\naboard or harvested by gear other than rod and reel,\" 50 C.F.R.  \n644.7(d) (1990),  \"shoreward of the  outer boundary of  the EEZ,\"\nid.    644.22.  The regulations delineate the EEZ as that span of\n   \nthe  sea from  the shoreward  boundary of  each coastal  state to\npoints 200 nautical miles from the \"baseline,\" or low water line,\nalong the  state's coast.  See 50 C.F.R.   620.2; see also Thomas\n                                                          \nJ.  Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime  Law   2-4,  at 26 (1987).\nAppellants do  not dispute  that the  F/V EAGLE  EYE is a  vessel\nsubject to 50 C.F.R.   644.7(d).   Similarly, they do not dispute\nthat San Juan Harbor lies within this nation's EEZ.\n\n     4The black  marlin is  an unprotected species  indigenous to\nthe Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.\n\n                                4\n\nnot the black) marlin.   He rested that determination  on several\n\npieces of evidence, including, inter alia, (1) the logbook, which\n                                         \n\nverified the  vessel's coordinates at  all relevant times;  (2) a\n\nswordfishing permit, which generally defined the vessel's fishing\n\narea; (3)  testimony  of a  crew  member regarding  the  vessel's\n\nlocation  during the  voyage; and  (4) Agent  Pickering's opinion\n\nthat the fish seemed to have been caught only a day or two before\n\nthe  ship had docked, or,  stated differently, four  to five days\n\nbefore  he  first  observed  it.     Based  principally  on  this\n\ndetermination as to  the situs of the catch, the ALJ decided that\n\nthe tail belonged to a blue marlin and fined appellants $5,250.\n\n          Appellants secured counsel and filed a petition seeking\n\nfurther administrative review, see  15 C.F.R.   904.273.   In the\n                                  \n\ncourse  of that review, appellants for the first time argued that\n\nNOAA  violated its  own confidentiality  regulations by  publicly\n\ndisclosing  information  contained in  the  logbook.5   The  NOAA\n\nAdministrator equivocated about the  merits of this argument, but\n\nconcluded  that,  in  all  events, appellants  were  barred  from\n\nadvancing it because they had not raised it before the ALJ.6\n\n                    \n\n     5Logbooks of this type must be kept as a matter of course by\nall  regulated  fishing  vessels,  and the  vessels  must  record\ncertain specified information therein.  See 50 C.F.R.   603.  The\n                                           \ninformation  is  gathered  for  use  in  the  agency's  fisheries\nmanagement  program and  is to  be held  in confidence,  see id.,\n                                                                \nsubject to certain specified exceptions, see, e.g.,  50 C.F.R.   \n                                                  \n603.5, 603.7.\n\n     6The  Administrator  based  his   finding  of  waiver  on  a\nprocedural regulation providing that:\n\n          Issues of  fact or law not  argued before the\n          [ALJ] may not be raised on review unless they\n\n                                5\n\n          Appellants then  sought judicial review pursuant  to 16\n\nU.S.C.    1861(d).  In their complaint, they again challenged the\n\nuse of the logbook  at the administrative hearing.   The district\n\ncourt dealt appellants a double blow; the court upheld the agency\n\ndetermination  on  the ground  of  procedural  default, and  also\n\nconcluded  that, wholly  apart  from the  logbook, there  existed\n\nample evidence  to underbrace  the ALJ's finding  that appellants\n\nunlawfully possessed a blue  marlin within the EEZ.   This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                II\n\n                         Troubled Waters\n                                        \n\n          The doctrine  of administrative  waiver is a  subset of\n\nthe broader  doctrine of  procedural default.

Appellants seek to invoke one such exception, applicable to\n\nsignificant questions of law, especially those  of constitutional\n\nmagnitude which are  not only likely to arise again  but also are\n\nsusceptible  to resolution  on the  existing record.   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States  v.

In furtherance of this attempt, appellants\n\nassert that  their  confidentiality argument  is substantive  and\n\nbears on NOAA's central  mission of fisheries management, raising\n\nthe  specter  that the  agency's  misuse  of routinely  collected\n\ninformation could drive fishermen to  falsify their records.   We\n\nare unpersuaded.   If  the NOAA Administrator  shared appellants'\n\nfear,   then   he  could   have   reached  out   to   decide  the\n\nconfidentiality  issue on  administrative review  as a  matter of\n\ndiscretion.   The fact that he did not  do so speaks volumes.  We\n\nadd, moreover,  that appellants come nowhere  near satisfying the\n\nother requirements  of the  La Guardia  exception.   For example,\n                                      \n\nthere is no reason to think that this question will recur   after\n\nall, it apparently  has not arisen on  any other occasion in  the\n\nseventeen-year  history of the Magnuson  Act   and,  at any rate,\n\n                    \n\n1973); see also Massachusetts DPW, 984  F.2d at 523 n.8.  This is\n                                 \nas  it should  be,  for both  rules  are aimed  at  assuring full\ndevelopment of fact and law at the agency level.\n\n                                7\n\nthe question cannotconfidently be resolvedon the existingrecord.8\n\n          Appellants have a second hook on their line.  They tell\n\nus that they proceeded pro se before the ALJ, represented only by\n\na  corporate  officer    and  the  officer  could  not have  been\n\nexpected to understand the  significance of admitting the logbook\n\ninto evidence.   Appellants view this  circumstance as sufficient\n\nto justify an exception to the administrative waiver rule, either\n\nbecause,  in  general, the  absence  of  counsel should  insulate\n\nparties from the  usual strictures  of the rule,  or because,  in\n\nparticular,  appellants  should  be  found  to  come  within  the\n\nregulatory  exception that permits a new argument to be raised if\n\nit \"could not  reasonably have been foreseen\" at  the time of the\n\ninitial hearing, 15 C.F.R.   904.273(d), quoted supra note 6.  We\n                                                     \n\nfind neither of these theorems to be convincing.\n\n          A pro se litigant,  like any litigant, is guaranteed  a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to be heard.  See Logan v. Zimmerman Brush\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     8The  government   denies  that  its  use   of  the  logbook\ntransgressed the confidentiality regulation.  To the contrary, it\nasserts  that all individuals  who had  access to  the statistics\nfell  within the confidentiality exemptions permitting disclosure\nto federal  employees responsible for monitoring  and enforcement\nof fisheries management plans, as well as to other NOAA personnel\non a need-to-know basis.  See 50 C.F.R.   603.5.   The government\n                             \nalso argues that limited use of otherwise confidential data, such\nas  logbook information,  is frequently  allowed for  purposes of\nenforcement  proceedings in  federal  courts,  see, e.g.,  United\n                                                                 \nStates v.

Hence, parties\n\nwho choose  to represent  themselves must be  held to  anticipate\n\nwhat  trained  counsel would  ordinarily  anticipate.   In  other\n\nwords, if a reasonably well-prepared litigant could have foreseen\n\nan  issue, and would have raised it, then the exception contained\n\nin the regulation does not pertain.  So it is here.\n\n                               III\n\n                      An Anchor to Windward\n                                           \n\n          Before  ending our  voyage, we  add that any  error was\n\nharmless.    We  have  carefully  reviewed  the  record  and  are\n\nconfident that  suppression  of the  logbook  would have  had  no\n\n                                10\n\neffect  on the outcome of  the proceeding.   Although the logbook\n\nentries  comprise  the  only evidence  establishing  the  precise\n                                                                 \n\nlocation of the F/V EAGLE EYE, the record makes manifest that the\n\nagency's case depends  upon the general  location of the  vessel,\n                                       \n\nnot its exact longitude and latitude  at any given moment.  Here,\n\nsubstantial evidence apart  from the logbook  entries establishes\n\nbeyond serious hope of  contradiction that the vessel was  in the\n\nCaribbean at the  time it caught the fish to  which the offending\n\ntail was once attached.   That evidence, without more,  was fully\n\nsufficient to  confirm the species of fish  and, consequently, to\n\nwarrant a finding that the regulations had been infringed.\n\n                                IV\n\n                 The Tail of the Tale of the Tail\n                                                 \n\n          We  need  go  no  further.

Here,\n\nat  long last,  appellants  must recognize  that, in  Hemingway's\n\nwords, they are  \"beaten now finally and without remedy.\"  Id. at\n                                                              \n\n131.
