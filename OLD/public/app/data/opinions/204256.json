In this political discrimination\n\ncase, Julio Del Toro Pacheco (Del Toro) alleges that he was fired\n\nfrom his job at the Puerto Rico Department of Correction and\n\nRehabilitation Administration (DCR) because his superiors, Roberto\n\nIzquierdo-Ocasio (Izquierdo) and Miguel A. Pereira, disagreed with\n\nhis political beliefs. The district court granted summary judgment\n\nfor the defendants on the ground that Del Toro had not established\n\na prima facie case of political discrimination because he failed to\n\nshow that the defendants knew of Del Toro's political affiliation.\n\nThe court also held that, assuming Del Toro was able to establish\n\na   prima   facie    case,   he   failed    to    show   that    his     political\n\naffiliation    was    a   substantial      or    motivating     factor    in   the\n\ntermination.    Del Toro now appeals.           We affirm.1\n\n                                      I.\n\n            We examine the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nappellant.     Statchen v. Palmer, 623 F.3d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 2010).2\n\nDel Toro began working as a corrections officer for the DCR in\n\nDecember 1993.       In 1996, he became a member of the police escort\n\nfor the then-governor of Puerto Rico, Pedro Rosselló, who, like Del\n\nToro, belonged to the New Progressive Party (NPP).                 A few years\n\n\n      1\n       The parties consented to the conduct of all proceedings in\nthe case by a magistrate judge, whose decision we therefore review\ndirectly. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(3); Fed. R. Civ. P. 73(c).\n      2\n      Del Toro makes a number of assertions in his appellate brief\nunsupported by any evidence in the record.     We do not consider\nthem.\n\n                                     -2-\n\flater, Del Toro joined the Special Arrest Unit (SAU) of the DCR\n\nwhere, beginning in 2000, he was supervised by Izquierdo.\n\n           Del Toro and Izquierdo had been acquainted since 1996.\n\nWhen Izquierdo became Director of the SAU, he gave Del Toro poor\n\nrecommendations.    Del Toro told Izquierdo he was annoyed by this,\n\nto which Izquierdo responded, \"You are going to be one of us, of\n\nthe 'reds,' you are going to be a [Popular Democratic Party (PDP)]\n\nmember.\"     The evaluations began to improve, and Del Toro never\n\nfiled an administrative complaint against Izquierdo.\n\n           According to Del Toro, Izquierdo gave better work to the\n\nSAU employees who were members of the PDP than to those who were\n\nmembers of the NPP.   He also favored the PDP members with regard to\n\nvacation and holidays.    Having been a supporter of the NPP since\n\n1996, Del Toro felt he was a target of Izquierdo's differential\n\ntreatment.\n\n           On March 27, 2006, at about 4:00 p.m., a 19-year-old\n\nwoman filed a report with the Puerto Rico Police alleging that, at\n\nabout noon that day, Del Toro had raped her at gunpoint.3   At about\n\n7:50 p.m., Del Toro was notified of the complaint and, about ten\n\n     3\n       The defendants submitted the police report, which included\na statement from the victim, in support of their motion for summary\njudgment. Del Toro objected to the report on the ground that it\nwas unauthenticated. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2); Fed. R. Evid.\n901(a). In the order granting summary judgment, the district court\ndetermined that several other exhibits were properly authenticated,\nbut did not address the admissibility of Exhibit 3, the police\nreport.   The order cites the police report, and thus the court\nappears to have considered it.     Nonetheless, Del Toro does not\nargue here that the court erred in doing so.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fminutes later, he called Izquierdo to inform him of the same.\n\nAfter speaking with Del Toro, Izquierdo called the police to verify\n\nwhat Del Toro had told him.\n\n          The   next   day,   Izquierdo   met   with   the    investigating\n\nofficer, who related the details provided by the victim.               The\n\nvictim had met Del Toro through her husband a few years earlier.\n\nDel Toro came to her house at about noon, saying he had brought\n\nsome car keys for her husband.     When he arrived, the victim was in\n\nan outdoor bathroom.    Del Toro entered the bathroom, brandished a\n\nfirearm, and forced her to have intercourse with him.\n\n          After meeting with the officer, Izquierdo met with Del\n\nToro, who said the victim had made up the story to get revenge\n\nafter Del Toro had ended their consensual affair.            Izquierdo then\n\nmet with a sergeant in the Sexual Crimes Unit, who told him that\n\nshe had interviewed the parties and decided to relieve Del Toro of\n\nboth his regulation weapon -- the gun he was issued for use as a\n\ncorrections officer -- and his personal gun, which he used for\n\ntarget shooting.   The sergeant also told Izquierdo that she had\n\nattempted to ask Del Toro questions but he refused to answer\n\nwithout his attorney present.\n\n          On March 29, Izquierdo drafted a report describing what\n\nhe had been told, and stating that charges would be filed by the\n\nprosecutor's office the following week.         Izquierdo's report was\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\flater delivered to his supervisor, Pereira, the Secretary of the DCR.\n\n           In response to the report, the DCR initiated an internal\n\ninvestigation of the alleged rape.           In June, an investigating\n\nofficer interviewed a policewoman, who stated that the prosecutor\n\nwas waiting to receive a laboratory report before filing formal\n\ncharges.    The    policewoman   stated,    however,    that   it   was   her\n\nunderstanding     that   the   evidence    they   had   was    \"clear     and\n\nconclusive.\"    She also reported that the victim had identified Del\n\nToro's service weapon as the gun he had used during the rape.\n\n           A DCR officer also interviewed the victim, who reiterated\n\nher version of the incident and confirmed that the gun with which\n\nDel Toro had threatened her was his service weapon.             The victim\n\nsaid that she feared for her life, as well as the lives of her\n\nhusband and her child.         Her husband, who was also interviewed\n\nduring the internal DCR investigation, told a compatible story and,\n\nlike the victim, said he feared for his life and for those of his\n\nwife and child.\n\n           According to Del Toro, Izquierdo's harassment escalated\n\nfollowing the March 2006 incident.        Izquierdo made comments to Del\n\nToro such as, \"If you were a member of the [PDP] maybe this [the\n\nadministrative investigation] would not be happening to you.\"\n\nIzquierdo told Del Toro that his dismissal letter was already\n\nsigned but that Izquierdo could prevent its delivery if Del Toro\n\npublicly affiliated with the PDP, and that not even former governor\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fRosselló could save him. Izquierdo also said, \"We have the perfect\n\nexcuse to dismiss you and you won't be able to sue us again.\"4\n\nAccording to Del Toro, Izquierdo harassed him every day.\n\n          On September 7, 2006, Pereira sent a letter to Del Toro\n\noutlining the results of the internal investigation.       Pereira\n\nstated that, regardless of the outcome of the criminal prosecution,\n\nhe had decided to dismiss Del Toro for violating a number of laws\n\nand regulations applicable to corrections officers.5    The letter\n\nexplained that Del Toro could request an informal administrative\n\nhearing within fifteen days, or else the dismissal would be final.\n\n\n     4\n       Izquierdo was apparently referring to a lawsuit Del Toro\nfiled in 2001 alleging that certain DCR officials had discriminated\nagainst him on the basis of his political affiliation. According\nto Del Toro, the case was dismissed because there was \"not enough\"\ndiscrimination to establish a legally cognizable injury.\n     5\n       Pereira cited the following provisions: Act No. 184, which\nrequires public employees not to \"[s]how a conduct which is\ninappropriate or harmful to the go[o]d name of the agency or the\nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,\" or \"[b]e guilty of\nprevarication, bribery, or immoral conduct,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3\n§ 1462e(8)(e) & (f); the Regulation for the Personnel of the\nAdministration of Correction, which requires DCR personnel to\n\"[o]bserve correct, courteous and respectful conduct standards in\ntheir relations with their supervisors, subordinates, co-workers\nand citizens,\" Art. 8, §§ 8.1 & 8.3, and provides that failure to\ndo so may result in disciplinary action; the Regulation of\nCorrections Officers of the Administration of Correction, which\nrequires the conduct of corrections officers to be \"adequate and in\naccordance with the guidelines applicable to the Administration of\nCorrection,\" Art. XII, § B; and the Manual for the Application of\nCorrective and Disciplinary Measures to the Employees of the\nAdministration of Corrections, which gives Pereira the authority to\nterminate employees who do not conform to the required standard of\nconduct, including those who commit \"any crime for which charges\nare filed or [for which the employee is jailed], which constitutes\na danger to the security or which affects its public funds.\"\n\n                               -6-\n\f            Del Toro requested the hearing and appeared before an\n\nexamining officer in January 2007.            His attorney accompanied him\n\nbut only presented arguments, not evidence.           In order to preserve\n\nhis Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, Del Toro\n\ndid not say anything.     On January 24, Pereira wrote a second letter\n\nto Del Toro, reiterating the regulations that Del Toro had violated\n\nand    dismissing   him   from   the   DCR.     In   that   letter,    Pereira\n\nadmonished Del Toro that his conduct was \"highly reproachable\" and\n\nhad violated the victim's \"dignity and physical integrity.\"                 As\n\nbefore, the letter explained the appeal process and, once again,\n\nDel Toro appealed.\n\n            Criminal charges were brought against Del Toro in March\n\n2007.   Del Toro was accused of violating articles 142(c) and 289 of\n\nthe Puerto Rico Penal Code, as well as article 5.15 of the Weapons\n\nLaw.     Article 5.15 relates to firing or pointing weapons, while\n\narticles 142(c) and 289 deal with sexual assault and threatening a\n\nwitness.     See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, § 458n; tit. 33, §§ 4770,\n\n4917.    Following a preliminary hearing on November 6, 2007, the\n\ncourt dismissed the charges because of its finding that there was\n\nno probable cause to support them.\n\n            Del Toro's administrative appeal proceeded.               In March\n\n2009, the Investigation, Processing and Appeals Committee (CIPA) of\n\nPuerto Rico reviewed the case and issued its decision affirming the\n\ndismissal.    In addition to setting forth CIPA's findings of fact,\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthe decision concluded that Del Toro had violated the regulations\n\nthat Pereira had cited.        Despite noting that the criminal charges\n\nhad   been   dropped,   CIPA   concluded     that    Del    Toro   had    in   fact\n\ncommitted a sexual assault, saying that his conduct \"not only\n\ndishonored the good name of the [DCR] but has vilified the dignity\n\nof men and women equally.\"         CIPA was particularly incensed at Del\n\nToro's abuse of his friends' trust, and stated that \"[t]here is no\n\nspace in the [DCR] nor in any agency with the important purpose of\n\nensuring the safety of the general public[] for a depraved, immoral\n\nindividual lacking values.\"\n\n             On January 30, 2008, Del Toro filed a complaint against\n\nIzquierdo and Pereira in their official and individual capacities,\n\nclaiming that they had violated his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment     rights.      The     complaint    also       included      political\n\ndiscrimination claims under Puerto Rico law, and sought both\n\ndamages and an injunction to reinstate Del Toro at the DCR and\n\nprevent further political discrimination against him.\n\n             After some preliminary skirmishing, the defendants moved\n\nfor summary judgment, arguing that Del Toro failed to establish a\n\nprima facie case of political discrimination, that due process was\n\nafforded,     that   the   court    should     not   exercise      supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the Puerto Rico claims, and that the individual\n\ncapacity defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.                       The\n\ndistrict court held that the pre-termination process Del Toro\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\freceived satisfied his constitutional rights.       The court further\n\nheld that he failed to establish a prima facie case of political\n\ndiscrimination because the evidence did not show that either\n\ndefendant knew that he was a member of the NPP.           Alternatively,\n\neven if he did establish his prima facie case, he failed to show\n\nthat he was terminated due to his affiliation rather than as a\n\nresult of the administrative investigation into the allegations of\n\nrape.    The    court   also   declined   to   exercise    supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the remaining Puerto Rico claims and dismissed\n\nthem without prejudice.   Del Toro then appealed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          We review the summary judgment order de novo.        Penn-Am.\n\nIns. Co. v. Lavigne, 617 F.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir. 2010).         We assess\n\nthe record and draw all reasonable inferences from it in the light\n\nmost favorable to Del Toro, the non-moving party.         Gastronomical\n\nWorkers Union Local 610 & Metro. Hotel Ass'n Pension Fund v. Dorado\n\nBeach Hotel Corp., 617 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2010).        We ignore any\n\n\"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported\n\nspeculation.\"   Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist., 584 F.3d 314, 325\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).   The grant of summary judgment will be affirmed\n\nwhere there are no genuine disputes of material fact and the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.          Gastronomical\n\nWorkers Union Local 610, 617 F.3d at 60; see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f56(a)6.   We need not adopt the district court's reasoning, but may\n\naffirm on any ground made apparent in the record.        Roman v. Potter,\n\n604 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n                                  III.\n\n            \"The First Amendment protects the right of public career\n\nemployees . . . to engage in political activities without fear of\n\nadverse employment actions.\"     Rodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González,\n\n438 F.3d 72, 79-80 (1st Cir. 2006).         In pursuing such a First\n\nAmendment claim, the plaintiff's prima facie case is established by\n\nintroducing evidence that \"(1) the plaintiff and the defendant\n\n[have] opposing political affiliations; (2) the defendant has\n\nknowledge    of   the   plaintiff's   affiliation;    (3)   a   challenged\n\nemployment action occurred; and (4) political affiliation was a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor behind it.\"         Welch v. Ciampa, 542\n\nF.3d 927, 938-39 (1st Cir. 2008) (alterations omitted) (quoting\n\nMartinez-Vélez v. Rey-Hernández, 506 F.3d 32, 39 (1st Cir. 2007)).\n\nThe defendants do not contest that they are members of the PDP and\n\nDel Toro is a member of the NPP, nor do they contest that Del Toro\n\nwas fired.    Thus, Del Toro has established the first and third\n\nelements of his prima facie case.\n\n\n     6\n       In its order granting summary judgment, the district court\ncorrectly cited Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). Rule 56 was\namended, effective December 1, 2010. The standard for granting\nsummary judgment now appears in subsection (a), but remains\nsubstantively the same.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 advisory\ncommittee's note; see also Godin v. Schencks, No. 09-2324, 2010 WL\n5175180, at *9 n.19 (1st Cir. Dec. 22, 2010).\n\n                                  -10-\n\f            With respect to the second prong, we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that Del Toro has not shown that Pereira knew of Del\n\nToro's affiliation with the NPP.   Del Toro admitted that he did not\n\nknow Pereira, that he had never spoken -- let alone discussed\n\npolitics -- with Pereira, and that the only reason he named Pereira\n\nin the complaint was because he was the Secretary of the DCR.7\n\nThus, Del Toro did not make out a prima facie case with respect to\n\nPereira.8\n\n            Izquierdo's knowledge of Del Toro's affiliation, on the\n\nother hand, presents a genuine dispute of material fact. Izquierdo\n\nmaintains that he did not know that Del Toro was an NPP member\n\nuntil the complaint was filed -- i.e., almost two years after\n\nIzquierdo alerted Pereira to the pending criminal investigation of\n\nDel Toro.    Del Toro, for his part, has submitted evidence that\n\nIzquierdo knew years before, when he gave Del Toro bad evaluations\n\nand told him, \"[Y]ou are going to be one of us, of the 'reds,' you\n\nare going to be a [PDP] member.\"   Del Toro also stated, under oath,\n\n     7\n       In an attempt to show that Pereira knew of his political\naffiliation, Del Toro relies heavily on his sworn statement that\nIzquierdo said, \"Pereira knows that you filed a claim against us\nand that you are a member of the NPP.\" Because Izquierdo's remark\nwas an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the\nmatter asserted, it is hearsay. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c), 802.\nSuch hearsay would be inadmissible at trial, and thus cannot be\nconsidered on a motion for summary judgment. See Saccucci Auto\nGrp., Inc. v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 617 F.3d 14, 25 (1st Cir. 2010).\n     8\n       Although Del Toro was an escort for a former NPP governor,\na position that would suggest to others that he was an NPP\nsupporter, he does not allege that Pereira knew he held that\nposition.\n\n                                -11-\n\fthat Izquierdo made a number of comments to him beginning in late\n\nMarch 2006 deriding his NPP affiliation and urging him to switch to\n\nthe   PDP   in   order   to     keep   his   job.    This    evidence   directly\n\ncontradicts Izquierdo's sworn statement, and thus creates a genuine\n\ndispute of material fact as to whether Izquierdo knew about Del\n\nToro's political affiliation before the termination.\n\n            One prong of the prima facie case remains, however, and\n\nDel Toro has not satisfied it here.            There is no indication in the\n\nrecord   that    Del   Toro's    NPP   affiliation     was    a   substantial   or\n\nmotivating factor behind his termination.                    Del Toro had been\n\nworking at the DCR, under Izquierdo's supervision, for years\n\nwithout any adverse employment action taken against him.                 In fact,\n\nthe great majority of the specific allegations of harassment took\n\nplace    after   Del     Toro    self-reported      the   rape    accusation    to\n\nIzquierdo. Izquierdo promptly investigated the matter and reported\n\nit to Pereira.     Del Toro does not suggest that this investigation\n\nor reporting was in any way inappropriate or beyond the scope of\n\nIzquierdo's duties and, given the nature of the alleged crime,\n\nfailure to report it to Pereira might well have been dereliction of\n\nduty.\n\n            Moreover, the record reflects that it was Pereira who\n\nmade the decision to fire Del Toro, not Izquierdo.                      Izquierdo\n\nstated that his only participation in the termination, other than\n\nreporting the criminal investigation to Pereira, was to serve as a\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fwitness to the delivery of Pereira's termination letter.       As we\n\nhave explained, there is no admissible evidence in the record that\n\nPereira knew of Del Toro's political affiliation.     Therefore, the\n\ntermination decision by Pereira could not have been motivated by\n\nthat affiliation.      Cf. Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28, 36\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (the fact of plaintiff's political differences with\n\none board member does not establish that the remainder of the board\n\n\"acquiesced in a plan to eliminate his position in retaliation for\n\nthose differences\").

In 1996, he became a member of the police escort\n\nfor the then-governor of Puerto Rico, Pedro Rosselló, who, like Del\n\nToro, belonged to the New Progressive Party (NPP).                 A few years\n\n\n      1\n       The parties consented to the conduct of all proceedings in\nthe case by a magistrate judge, whose decision we therefore review\ndirectly. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(3); Fed. R. Civ. P. 73(c).\n      2\n      Del Toro makes a number of assertions in his appellate brief\nunsupported by any evidence in the record.     We do not consider\nthem.\n\n                                     -2-\n\flater, Del Toro joined the Special Arrest Unit (SAU) of the DCR\n\nwhere, beginning in 2000, he was supervised by Izquierdo.\n\n           Del Toro and Izquierdo had been acquainted since 1996.\n\nWhen Izquierdo became Director of the SAU, he gave Del Toro poor\n\nrecommendations.    Del Toro told Izquierdo he was annoyed by this,\n\nto which Izquierdo responded, \"You are going to be one of us, of\n\nthe 'reds,' you are going to be a [Popular Democratic Party (PDP)]\n\nmember.\"     The evaluations began to improve, and Del Toro never\n\nfiled an administrative complaint against Izquierdo.\n\n           According to Del Toro, Izquierdo gave better work to the\n\nSAU employees who were members of the PDP than to those who were\n\nmembers of the NPP.   He also favored the PDP members with regard to\n\nvacation and holidays.    Having been a supporter of the NPP since\n\n1996, Del Toro felt he was a target of Izquierdo's differential\n\ntreatment.\n\n           On March 27, 2006, at about 4:00 p.m., a 19-year-old\n\nwoman filed a report with the Puerto Rico Police alleging that, at\n\nabout noon that day, Del Toro had raped her at gunpoint.3   At about\n\n7:50 p.m., Del Toro was notified of the complaint and, about ten\n\n     3\n       The defendants submitted the police report, which included\na statement from the victim, in support of their motion for summary\njudgment. Del Toro objected to the report on the ground that it\nwas unauthenticated. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2); Fed. R. Evid.\n901(a). In the order granting summary judgment, the district court\ndetermined that several other exhibits were properly authenticated,\nbut did not address the admissibility of Exhibit 3, the police\nreport.   The order cites the police report, and thus the court\nappears to have considered it.     Nonetheless, Del Toro does not\nargue here that the court erred in doing so.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fminutes later, he called Izquierdo to inform him of the same.\n\nAfter speaking with Del Toro, Izquierdo called the police to verify\n\nwhat Del Toro had told him.\n\n          The   next   day,   Izquierdo   met   with   the    investigating\n\nofficer, who related the details provided by the victim.               The\n\nvictim had met Del Toro through her husband a few years earlier.\n\nDel Toro came to her house at about noon, saying he had brought\n\nsome car keys for her husband.     When he arrived, the victim was in\n\nan outdoor bathroom.    Del Toro entered the bathroom, brandished a\n\nfirearm, and forced her to have intercourse with him.\n\n          After meeting with the officer, Izquierdo met with Del\n\nToro, who said the victim had made up the story to get revenge\n\nafter Del Toro had ended their consensual affair.            Izquierdo then\n\nmet with a sergeant in the Sexual Crimes Unit, who told him that\n\nshe had interviewed the parties and decided to relieve Del Toro of\n\nboth his regulation weapon -- the gun he was issued for use as a\n\ncorrections officer -- and his personal gun, which he used for\n\ntarget shooting.   The sergeant also told Izquierdo that she had\n\nattempted to ask Del Toro questions but he refused to answer\n\nwithout his attorney present.\n\n          On March 29, Izquierdo drafted a report describing what\n\nhe had been told, and stating that charges would be filed by the\n\nprosecutor's office the following week.         Izquierdo's report was\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\flater delivered to his supervisor, Pereira, the Secretary of the DCR.\n\n           In response to the report, the DCR initiated an internal\n\ninvestigation of the alleged rape.           In June, an investigating\n\nofficer interviewed a policewoman, who stated that the prosecutor\n\nwas waiting to receive a laboratory report before filing formal\n\ncharges.    The    policewoman   stated,    however,    that   it   was   her\n\nunderstanding     that   the   evidence    they   had   was    \"clear     and\n\nconclusive.\"    She also reported that the victim had identified Del\n\nToro's service weapon as the gun he had used during the rape.\n\n           A DCR officer also interviewed the victim, who reiterated\n\nher version of the incident and confirmed that the gun with which\n\nDel Toro had threatened her was his service weapon.             The victim\n\nsaid that she feared for her life, as well as the lives of her\n\nhusband and her child.         Her husband, who was also interviewed\n\nduring the internal DCR investigation, told a compatible story and,\n\nlike the victim, said he feared for his life and for those of his\n\nwife and child.\n\n           According to Del Toro, Izquierdo's harassment escalated\n\nfollowing the March 2006 incident.        Izquierdo made comments to Del\n\nToro such as, \"If you were a member of the [PDP] maybe this [the\n\nadministrative investigation] would not be happening to you.\"\n\nIzquierdo told Del Toro that his dismissal letter was already\n\nsigned but that Izquierdo could prevent its delivery if Del Toro\n\npublicly affiliated with the PDP, and that not even former governor\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fRosselló could save him. Izquierdo also said, \"We have the perfect\n\nexcuse to dismiss you and you won't be able to sue us again.\"4\n\nAccording to Del Toro, Izquierdo harassed him every day.\n\n          On September 7, 2006, Pereira sent a letter to Del Toro\n\noutlining the results of the internal investigation.       Pereira\n\nstated that, regardless of the outcome of the criminal prosecution,\n\nhe had decided to dismiss Del Toro for violating a number of laws\n\nand regulations applicable to corrections officers.5    The letter\n\nexplained that Del Toro could request an informal administrative\n\nhearing within fifteen days, or else the dismissal would be final.\n\n\n     4\n       Izquierdo was apparently referring to a lawsuit Del Toro\nfiled in 2001 alleging that certain DCR officials had discriminated\nagainst him on the basis of his political affiliation. According\nto Del Toro, the case was dismissed because there was \"not enough\"\ndiscrimination to establish a legally cognizable injury.\n     5\n       Pereira cited the following provisions: Act No. 184, which\nrequires public employees not to \"[s]how a conduct which is\ninappropriate or harmful to the go[o]d name of the agency or the\nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,\" or \"[b]e guilty of\nprevarication, bribery, or immoral conduct,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3\n§ 1462e(8)(e) & (f); the Regulation for the Personnel of the\nAdministration of Correction, which requires DCR personnel to\n\"[o]bserve correct, courteous and respectful conduct standards in\ntheir relations with their supervisors, subordinates, co-workers\nand citizens,\" Art. 8, §§ 8.1 & 8.3, and provides that failure to\ndo so may result in disciplinary action; the Regulation of\nCorrections Officers of the Administration of Correction, which\nrequires the conduct of corrections officers to be \"adequate and in\naccordance with the guidelines applicable to the Administration of\nCorrection,\" Art. XII, § B; and the Manual for the Application of\nCorrective and Disciplinary Measures to the Employees of the\nAdministration of Corrections, which gives Pereira the authority to\nterminate employees who do not conform to the required standard of\nconduct, including those who commit \"any crime for which charges\nare filed or [for which the employee is jailed], which constitutes\na danger to the security or which affects its public funds.\"\n\n                               -6-\n\f            Del Toro requested the hearing and appeared before an\n\nexamining officer in January 2007.            His attorney accompanied him\n\nbut only presented arguments, not evidence.           In order to preserve\n\nhis Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, Del Toro\n\ndid not say anything.     On January 24, Pereira wrote a second letter\n\nto Del Toro, reiterating the regulations that Del Toro had violated\n\nand    dismissing   him   from   the   DCR.     In   that   letter,    Pereira\n\nadmonished Del Toro that his conduct was \"highly reproachable\" and\n\nhad violated the victim's \"dignity and physical integrity.\"                 As\n\nbefore, the letter explained the appeal process and, once again,\n\nDel Toro appealed.\n\n            Criminal charges were brought against Del Toro in March\n\n2007.   Del Toro was accused of violating articles 142(c) and 289 of\n\nthe Puerto Rico Penal Code, as well as article 5.15 of the Weapons\n\nLaw.     Article 5.15 relates to firing or pointing weapons, while\n\narticles 142(c) and 289 deal with sexual assault and threatening a\n\nwitness.     See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, § 458n; tit. 33, §§ 4770,\n\n4917.    Following a preliminary hearing on November 6, 2007, the\n\ncourt dismissed the charges because of its finding that there was\n\nno probable cause to support them.\n\n            Del Toro's administrative appeal proceeded.               In March\n\n2009, the Investigation, Processing and Appeals Committee (CIPA) of\n\nPuerto Rico reviewed the case and issued its decision affirming the\n\ndismissal.    In addition to setting forth CIPA's findings of fact,\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthe decision concluded that Del Toro had violated the regulations\n\nthat Pereira had cited.        Despite noting that the criminal charges\n\nhad   been   dropped,   CIPA   concluded     that    Del    Toro   had    in   fact\n\ncommitted a sexual assault, saying that his conduct \"not only\n\ndishonored the good name of the [DCR] but has vilified the dignity\n\nof men and women equally.\"         CIPA was particularly incensed at Del\n\nToro's abuse of his friends' trust, and stated that \"[t]here is no\n\nspace in the [DCR] nor in any agency with the important purpose of\n\nensuring the safety of the general public[] for a depraved, immoral\n\nindividual lacking values.\"\n\n             On January 30, 2008, Del Toro filed a complaint against\n\nIzquierdo and Pereira in their official and individual capacities,\n\nclaiming that they had violated his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment     rights.      The     complaint    also       included      political\n\ndiscrimination claims under Puerto Rico law, and sought both\n\ndamages and an injunction to reinstate Del Toro at the DCR and\n\nprevent further political discrimination against him.\n\n             After some preliminary skirmishing, the defendants moved\n\nfor summary judgment, arguing that Del Toro failed to establish a\n\nprima facie case of political discrimination, that due process was\n\nafforded,     that   the   court    should     not   exercise      supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the Puerto Rico claims, and that the individual\n\ncapacity defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.                       The\n\ndistrict court held that the pre-termination process Del Toro\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\freceived satisfied his constitutional rights.       The court further\n\nheld that he failed to establish a prima facie case of political\n\ndiscrimination because the evidence did not show that either\n\ndefendant knew that he was a member of the NPP.           Alternatively,\n\neven if he did establish his prima facie case, he failed to show\n\nthat he was terminated due to his affiliation rather than as a\n\nresult of the administrative investigation into the allegations of\n\nrape.    The    court   also   declined   to   exercise    supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the remaining Puerto Rico claims and dismissed\n\nthem without prejudice.   Del Toro then appealed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          We review the summary judgment order de novo.        Penn-Am.\n\nIns. Co. v.

Del Toro admitted that he did not\n\nknow Pereira, that he had never spoken -- let alone discussed\n\npolitics -- with Pereira, and that the only reason he named Pereira\n\nin the complaint was because he was the Secretary of the DCR.7\n\nThus, Del Toro did not make out a prima facie case with respect to\n\nPereira.8\n\n            Izquierdo's knowledge of Del Toro's affiliation, on the\n\nother hand, presents a genuine dispute of material fact. Izquierdo\n\nmaintains that he did not know that Del Toro was an NPP member\n\nuntil the complaint was filed -- i.e., almost two years after\n\nIzquierdo alerted Pereira to the pending criminal investigation of\n\nDel Toro.    Del Toro, for his part, has submitted evidence that\n\nIzquierdo knew years before, when he gave Del Toro bad evaluations\n\nand told him, \"[Y]ou are going to be one of us, of the 'reds,' you\n\nare going to be a [PDP] member.\"   Del Toro also stated, under oath,\n\n     7\n       In an attempt to show that Pereira knew of his political\naffiliation, Del Toro relies heavily on his sworn statement that\nIzquierdo said, \"Pereira knows that you filed a claim against us\nand that you are a member of the NPP.\" Because Izquierdo's remark\nwas an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the\nmatter asserted, it is hearsay.

This    evidence   directly\n\ncontradicts Izquierdo's sworn statement, and thus creates a genuine\n\ndispute of material fact as to whether Izquierdo knew about Del\n\nToro's political affiliation before the termination.\n\n            One prong of the prima facie case remains, however, and\n\nDel Toro has not satisfied it here.            There is no indication in the\n\nrecord   that    Del   Toro's    NPP   affiliation     was    a   substantial   or\n\nmotivating factor behind his termination.                    Del Toro had been\n\nworking at the DCR, under Izquierdo's supervision, for years\n\nwithout any adverse employment action taken against him.                 In fact,\n\nthe great majority of the specific allegations of harassment took\n\nplace    after   Del     Toro    self-reported      the   rape    accusation    to\n\nIzquierdo. Izquierdo promptly investigated the matter and reported\n\nit to Pereira.     Del Toro does not suggest that this investigation\n\nor reporting was in any way inappropriate or beyond the scope of\n\nIzquierdo's duties and, given the nature of the alleged crime,\n\nfailure to report it to Pereira might well have been dereliction of\n\nduty.\n\n            Moreover, the record reflects that it was Pereira who\n\nmade the decision to fire Del Toro, not Izquierdo.                      Izquierdo\n\nstated that his only participation in the termination, other than\n\nreporting the criminal investigation to Pereira, was to serve as a\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fwitness to the delivery of Pereira's termination letter.       As we\n\nhave explained, there is no admissible evidence in the record that\n\nPereira knew of Del Toro's political affiliation.     Therefore, the\n\ntermination decision by Pereira could not have been motivated by\n\nthat affiliation.      Cf. Vazquez v.
