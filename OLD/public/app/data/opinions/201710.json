Gene Carter, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Selya, Lynch, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     John J.E. Markham, II, with whom Markham & Read, was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           July 19, 2005\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.           Chad Bartos was convicted of\n\nbeing   a   felon   in    possession   of    a   firearm,   see   18   U.S.C.   §\n\n922(g)(1), and possession of a stolen firearm, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n922(j).     Bartos seeks a new trial, arguing that his convictions\n\nwere tainted by three alleged errors: an evidentiary ruling that\n\nwas outside the judge's discretion, the judge's improper coercion\n\nof a witness into retracting testimony that was favorable to the\n\ndefense, and the judge's unbalanced and prosecution-friendly trial\n\nmanagement rulings.\n\n            There was evidence from which the jury reasonably could\n\nhave concluded that Bartos stole a .22 caliber Ruger revolver from\n\nhis uncle while the two were visiting a relative's hunting camp in\n\nnorthern Maine.          Crucial inculpatory evidence came from three\n\nwitnesses -- Bartos's twin cousins and a friend of theirs -- who\n\ntestified that, shortly after the theft, Bartos brandished the\n\nfirearm in front of them in a Lewiston motel room.            One of Bartos's\n\ncousins (Jeff Bartos) and the friend (Joey White) also testified\n\nthat Bartos expressed an intention to \"take\" the firearm with him\n\nto another location.          Bartos's first two appellate arguments\n\ninvolve this \"intention\" evidence and the manner in which it came\n\ninto the record.\n\n            Bartos first argues that this evidence should not have\n\nbeen admitted at all.          Bartos says that the evidence of his\n\nintention to take the firearm to another location was of little\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\frelevance to whether he possessed the firearm unlawfully (as was\n\ncharged), and that the evidence was highly prejudicial because it\n\nmight have led the jury to speculate that he was planning to use\n\nthe gun to commit a violent felony. Consequently, Bartos contends,\n\nthe trial judge abused his admittedly wide discretion in declining\n\nto exclude the evidence under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) or 403.         See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Balsam, 203 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            We start by observing that this argument has not been\n\npreserved for plenary appellate review. The issue was joined below\n\nonly at a pretrial conference, where Bartos moved to exclude\n\nanticipated testimony that he had stated to his cousins and their\n\nfriend an intention to use the stolen firearm to rob Massachusetts\n\ndrug dealers, whom he described as \"niggers,\" of guns and money.\n\nWhile noting the \"arguable relevance\" of the evidence, Bartos took\n\nthe position that such testimony was highly prejudicial \"other\n\ncrime\" evidence that should be excluded under Rule 404(b) and Rule\n\n403.   The government countered that the evidence was admissible to\n\nshow that Bartos had a plan for the gun, which in turn tended to\n\ndemonstrate intentional and knowing (as opposed to accidental)\n\npossession.     The government did, however, offer to instruct the\n\nwitnesses     not   to   use   the   inflammatory   term   \"niggers.\"\n\n            At this point, the court stated:\n\n            Why isn't [sic] just simply the fact that he\n            said, I have - I want the gun because I have\n            use for it in Massachusetts, period, that\n            shows his - that's all you need to establish\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          what you want to establish, the rest of it\n          really does get involved in the question about\n          other criminal conduct, not charged, and into\n          the inflammatory - the use of the word\n          \"nigger.\"\n\nThe court then asked government and defense counsel whether they\n\nwere satisfied with having the witnesses testify that Bartos had\n\nstated that he had a use for the gun in Massachusetts.              Government\n\ncounsel said that such a ruling would satisfy him, and defense\n\ncounsel added, without qualification, \"I accept that ruling.\"                   At\n\ntrial, nobody objected when Jeff Bartos and Joey White testified\n\nthat Bartos told them that he was going to \"take\" the gun with him\n\n-- somewhere outside the motel, according to Jeff Bartos; to\n\nMassachusetts, according to Joey White.\n\n          At best, the foregoing describes a situation involving a\n\nforfeited claim of error.         See generally United States v. Olano,\n\n507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993) (discussing the difference between waived\n\nand forfeited arguments).         Such a claim can ground a vacatur or\n\nreversal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), but only if the underlying\n\nerror is plain and has affected the defendant's substantial rights\n\nby affecting the outcome of the trial court proceedings.                    See\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 734-35.        Even then, relief under Rule 52(b) is\n\ndiscretionary   and   is   only    to    be   awarded   in   the   event   of    a\n\nmiscarriage of justice -- i.e., where the error has seriously\n\naffected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.    See id. at 735-37.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f          The admission of the testimony about Bartos's plan for\n\nthe gun was not error, let alone plain error.   The evidence was, as\n\nthe government argued prior to trial (and as Bartos all but\n\nconceded), relevant to Bartos's intent and knowledge; it helped to\n\nexplain why he committed the charged crimes.     See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n404(b) (evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" not admissible\n\nto prove the character of a person in order to show action in\n\nconformity therewith, but admissible for other purposes, including\n\nintent and knowledge).   Moreover, the district court took pains to\n\nminimize its potentially prejudicial impact, ordering that the\n\nwitnesses testify only that Bartos had \"use for\" the gun in\n\nMassachusetts (and not that he planned to use it to commit a\n\nracially motivated violent crime).    And the testimony, as it came\n\nin, was even more benign.    As we have stated, the testimony was\n\nonly that Bartos intended to \"take\" the gun with him to another\n\nlocation; no witness testified that he planned to \"use\" the firearm\n\nin any way.\n\n          Bartos's next argument concerns what he describes as the\n\ndistrict court's improper coercion of his cousin, Jeff Bartos, into\n\neffectively rescinding testimony that Bartos had said nothing about\n\nhis plans for the gun.   Invoking Webb v. Texas, 409 U.S. 95 (1972)\n\n(per curiam), which held that a Texas trial judge deprived a\n\ndefendant of due process by intimidating a defense witness from\n\noffering testimony favorable to the accused, see id. at 95-98,\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fBartos says that his constitutional rights -- Bartos does not\n\nspecify the source of the rights -- were violated during the course\n\nof a colloquy that took place between the trial judge and his\n\ncousin outside the presence of the jury.    We set forth the colloquy\n\nin context, noting that, at the pretrial conference, the government\n\nasked for and received permission to ask leading questions of Jeff\n\nBartos, who is bipolar and suffers from manic depression:\n\n          Q (by [Government Counsel]): Just answer my\n          question yes or no, did [Bartos] say that he\n          wanted to take the gun to Massachusetts?\n\n          A:    Not directly I guess.    I don't --\n\n          Q:   Did he say he wanted to take the gun\n          somewhere else, yes or no?\n\n          A: I don't think he said exactly he's going\n          to take it to Mass.\n\n                  THE COURT: Yes or no.\n\n                 THE WITNESS: No.      I don't know how to\n          answer it.\n\n          Q (by [Government Counsel]): Did he say he\n          wanted to take the gun somewhere else, yes or\n          no?\n\n          A: I guess he was going to take it with him\n          somewhere.\n\n                 THE COURT:  The question was, did he\n          say that he wanted to take the gun somewhere\n          else? Yes or no.\n\n                  THE WITNESS:   I guess no.\n\n          Q (by [Government Counsel]):      I'm not asking\n          for his exact words.\n\n          A:   All right.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fQ: Did he say that he wanted to take the gun\nsome place other than [the motel where Jeff\ntestified that Bartos had brandished the\nweapon] and do something with it?\n\n       THE COURT:   I'm going to excuse the\nladies and gentlemen of the jury momentarily.\nWould you take them, Mr. Officer, to the jury\nroom, and please don't discuss the case.\n\n                [JURY LEAVES]\n\n       THE COURT: Mr. Bartos, I've been doing\nthis a long time, almost as long as you've\nbeen alive, do you know that? I think I have\na pretty good idea where somebody is playing\nfast and loose with the truth or evading the\nquestions.\n       You took an oath when you began your\ntestimony to tell the truth, the whole truth,\nand nothing but the truth so help you God.\n\n       THE WITNESS:   But --\n\n       THE COURT:   Just a minute.    I'm not\nsatisfied that you're doing that.      So I'm\ngoing to bring the jury back and afford\n[government counsel] an opportunity to ask you\nfurther questions.\n\n       THE WITNESS:   Okay.\n\n       THE COURT:   I ask you to bear this\nadmonition in mind when you answer those\nquestions. Do you understand me?\n\n       THE WITNESS:   Yes.\n\n       THE COURT:   Bring back the jury.\n\n       [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:      Pardon   me,   your\nHonor, before --\n\n       THE COURT:   Yes.\n\n       [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Defense wants to be\nsure that the witness doesn't feel in some way\n\n\n                      -7-\n\f          intimidated, there's a particular answer he's\n          supposed to give.\n\n                  THE COURT:    I have not suggested to him\n          --\n\n                  THE WITNESS:    Oh, no –\n\n                 THE COURT:   Just a minute.    I'm not\n          suggesting to him and he understands that, do\n          you not, you answer, give any particular\n          answer to a question. I'm simply telling you\n          to answer them honestly and fully as they are\n          asked to you as you can do.\n\n                  THE WITNESS:    Okay.\n\n                 THE COURT:    Do you understand that?\n          Does that solve the problem.\n\n                  [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:      Thank you . . . .\n\n                      DIRECT EXAMINATION CONTINUED\n\n          Q:    So Mr. Bartos, with respect to the\n          firearm, did Chad Bartos say he was going to\n          take the gun out of the motel.\n\n          A:   Yes.\n\n          Q: And did he have -- did he tell you that he\n          had a purpose for the gun, yes or no? Do you\n          understand my question.\n\n          A:   Yes.    No.\n\n          The premise of Bartos's argument with respect to this\n\ncolloquy -- a colloquy that prompted neither an objection nor a\n\nmotion for a mistrial -- is that, against expectations, Jeff Bartos\n\ntestified that Bartos said nothing about his plans for the gun in\n\nthe motel room.       Bartos contends that the trial judge did not\n\nbelieve this testimony; that he excused the jury to express his\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fdisbelief     and   to    warn    Jeff    to     tell    the   truth;     and     that,\n\nintimidated,    Jeff     reversed    course      and    gave   a   variant      of    the\n\nexpected    testimony.       In     Bartos's      telling,     defense     counsel's\n\neventual expression of concern and the judge's response were too\n\nlittle, and came too late, to cure the damage that had been done.\n\n               We reject this argument because we do not accept the\n\npremise on which it is built.         Jeff Bartos's testimony prior to the\n\ntrial   judge's     intervention      does       not    contain    an    unequivocal\n\nstatement that Bartos said nothing about his plans for the gun; it\n\ncontains only statements suggesting confusion and discomfort with\n\nproviding an unequivocal yes or no answer to the questions being\n\nposed. The trial judge read evasiveness into Jeff's hesitancy, and\n\nwe are not inclined to reject his on-the-spot judgment.                           But a\n\nsecond possibility is at least worth mentioning:                       that Jeff was\n\nprepared for the specific question discussed at the pretrial\n\nconference -- whether Bartos had expressed an intention to use the\n\nfirearm to rob Massachusetts drug dealers -- and became confused\n\nwhen the question was posed at a significantly higher level of\n\ngenerality.     In any event, on our reading of the record, this is\n\nnot a situation in which a witness intended to give exculpatory\n\ntestimony but was dissuaded from doing so by a trial judge who\n\ndisbelieved him.         Cf. United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299,\n\n1303-05 (1st Cir. 1987) (conduct by the sovereign alleged to\n\ninterfere   with    an    accused's      right    to    present    a    defense      must\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\factually cause the loss or erosion of evidence that is both\n\nmaterial and favorable to the accused).\n\n           Bartos's final argument -- that the trial judge was heavy\n\nhanded   and   tilted   in   favor    of   the    prosecution     in   its    trial\n\nmanagement rulings -- depends heavily on our having accepted the\n\npremise, if not the conclusion, of his second argument.                         For\n\nreasons already explained we have rejected that premise.                    We need\n\nonly add that we have read the trial transcript with care and are\n\nquite    comfortable    that    the    district     court's       various     trial\n\nmanagement rulings, including all of those referenced in Bartos's\n\nbrief, were well within its discretion.              Cf. Logue v. Dore, 103\n\nF.3d 1040, 1045 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that a trial judge has wide\n\ndiscretion     to   interject   clarifying       questions   or    otherwise     to\n\nexpedite the pace of a trial).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f",

No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The premise of Bartos's argument with respect to this colloquy &#8212; a colloquy that prompted neither an objection nor a motion for a mistrial &#8212; is that, against expectations, Jeff Bartos testified that Bartos said nothing about his plans for the gun in the motel room. Bartos contends that the trial judge did not believe this testimony; that he excused the jury to express his disbelief and to warn Jeff to tell the truth; and that, intimidated, Jeff reversed course and gave a variant of the expected testimony. In Bartos's telling, defense counsel's eventual expression of concern and the judge's response were too little, and came too late, to cure the damage that had been done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument because we do not accept the premise on which it is built. Jeff Bartos's testimony prior to the trial judge's intervention does not contain an unequivocal statement that Bartos said nothing about his plans for the gun; it contains only statements suggesting confusion and discomfort with providing an unequivocal yes or no answer to the questions being posed. The trial judge read evasiveness into Jeff's hesitancy, and we are not inclined to reject his on-the-spot judgment. But a second possibility is at least worth mentioning: that Jeff was prepared for the specific question discussed at the pretrial conference &#8212; whether Bartos had expressed an intention to use the firearm to rob Massachusetts drug dealers &#8212; and became confused when the question was posed at a significantly higher level of generality. In any event, on our reading of the record, this is not a situation in which a witness intended to give exculpatory testimony but was dissuaded from doing so by a trial judge who disbelieved him. <i>Cf. United States v. Hoffman,</i> 832 F.2d 1299, 1303-05 (1st Cir.1987) (conduct by the sovereign alleged to interfere with an accused's right to present a defense must actually cause the loss or erosion of evidence that is both material and favorable to the accused).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bartos's final argument &#8212; that the trial judge was heavy handed and tilted in favor of the prosecution in its trial management rulings &#8212; depends heavily on our having accepted the premise, if not the conclusion, of his second argument. For reasons already explained we have rejected that premise. We need only add that we have read the trial transcript with care and are quite comfortable that the district court's various trial management rulings, including all of those referenced in Bartos's brief, were well within its discretion. <i>Cf. Logue v. Dore,</i> 103 F.3d 1040, 1045 (1st Cir.1997) (noting that a trial judge has wide discretion to interject clarifying questions or otherwise to expedite the pace of a trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Bartos seeks a new trial, arguing that his convictions were tainted by three alleged errors: an evidentiary ruling that was outside the judge's discretion, the judge's improper coercion of a witness into retracting testimony that was favorable to the defense, and the judge's unbalanced and prosecution-friendly trial management rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that Bartos stole a .22 caliber Ruger revolver from his uncle while the two were visiting a relative's hunting camp in northern Maine. Crucial inculpatory evidence came from three witnesses &#8212; Bartos's twin cousins and a friend of theirs &#8212; who testified that, shortly after the theft, Bartos brandished the firearm in front of them in a Lewiston motel room. One of Bartos's cousins (Jeff Bartos) and the friend (Joey White) also testified that Bartos expressed an intention to \"take\" the firearm with him to another location. Bartos's first two appellate arguments involve this \"intention\" evidence and the manner in which it came into the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bartos first argues that this evidence should not have been admitted at all. Bartos says that the evidence of his intention to take the firearm to another location was of little relevance to whether he <i>possessed</i> the firearm unlawfully (as was charged), and that the evidence was highly prejudicial because it might have led the jury to speculate that he was planning to use the gun to commit a violent felony. Consequently, Bartos contends, the trial judge abused his admittedly wide discretion in declining to exclude the evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) or 403. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Balsam,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198819\"><a href=\"/opinion/198819/united-states-v-balsam/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by observing that this argument has not been preserved for plenary appellate review. The issue was joined below only at a pretrial conference, where Bartos moved to exclude anticipated testimony that he had stated to his cousins and their friend an intention to use the stolen firearm to rob Massachusetts drug dealers, whom he described as \"niggers,\" of guns and money. While noting the \"arguable relevance\" of the evidence, Bartos took the position that such testimony was highly prejudicial \"other crime\" evidence that should be excluded under Rule 404(b) and Rule 403. The government countered that the evidence was admissible to show that Bartos had a plan for the gun, which in turn tended to demonstrate intentional and knowing (as opposed to accidental) possession. The government did, however, offer to instruct the witnesses not to use the inflammatory term \"niggers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the court stated:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why isn't [sic] just simply the fact that he said, I have &#8212; I want the gun because I have use for it in Massachusetts, period, that shows his &#8212; that's all you need to establish what you want to establish, the rest of it really does get involved in the question about other criminal conduct, not charged, and into the inflammatory &#8212; the use of the word \"nigger.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then asked government and defense counsel whether they were satisfied with having the witnesses testify that Bartos had stated that he had a use for the gun in Massachusetts. Government counsel said that such a ruling would satisfy him, and defense counsel added, without qualification, \"I accept that ruling.\" At trial, nobody objected when Jeff Bartos and Joey White testified that Bartos told them that he was going to \"take\" the gun with him &#8212; somewhere outside the motel, according to Jeff Bartos; to Massachusetts, according to Joey White.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At best, the foregoing describes a situation involving a forfeited claim of error. <i>See generally United States v.

Do you understand my question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes. No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The premise of Bartos's argument with respect to this colloquy &#8212; a colloquy that prompted neither an objection nor a motion for a mistrial &#8212; is that, against expectations, Jeff Bartos testified that Bartos said nothing about his plans for the gun in the motel room. Bartos contends that the trial judge did not believe this testimony; that he excused the jury to express his disbelief and to warn Jeff to tell the truth; and that, intimidated, Jeff reversed course and gave a variant of the expected testimony. In Bartos's telling, defense counsel's eventual expression of concern and the judge's response were too little, and came too late, to cure the damage that had been done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument because we do not accept the premise on which it is built. Jeff Bartos's testimony prior to the trial judge's intervention does not contain an unequivocal statement that Bartos said nothing about his plans for the gun; it contains only statements suggesting confusion and discomfort with providing an unequivocal yes or no answer to the questions being posed. The trial judge read evasiveness into Jeff's hesitancy, and we are not inclined to reject his on-the-spot judgment. But a second possibility is at least worth mentioning: that Jeff was prepared for the specific question discussed at the pretrial conference &#8212; whether Bartos had expressed an intention to use the firearm to rob Massachusetts drug dealers &#8212; and became confused when the question was posed at a significantly higher level of generality. In any event, on our reading of the record, this is not a situation in which a witness intended to give exculpatory testimony but was dissuaded from doing so by a trial judge who disbelieved him. <i>Cf. United States v. Hoffman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496986\"><a href=\"/opinion/496986/united-states-v-barry-hoffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1303-05 (1st Cir.1987) (conduct by the sovereign alleged to interfere with an accused's right to present a defense must actually cause the loss or erosion of evidence that is both material and favorable to the accused).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bartos's final argument &#8212; that the trial judge was heavy handed and tilted in favor of the prosecution in its trial management rulings &#8212; depends heavily on our having accepted the premise, if not the conclusion, of his second argument. For reasons already explained we have rejected that premise. We need only add that we have read the trial transcript with care and are quite comfortable that the district court's various trial management rulings, including all of those referenced in Bartos's brief, were well within its discretion. <i>Cf. Logue v. Dore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197149\"><a href=\"/opinion/197149/logue-v-dore/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1045 (1st Cir.1997) (noting that a trial judge has wide discretion to interject clarifying questions or otherwise to expedite the pace of a trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
