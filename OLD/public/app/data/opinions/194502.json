This is an appeal\n                                            \n\nfrom a grant  of a judgment  n.o.v. in favor of  defendant, Tandy\n\nCorporation, and against plaintiff, John J. MacDonald.  MacDonald\n\nwas fired from  his job as  a sales-trainee at  a store owned  by\n\nTandy in  Manchester, New Hampshire because  Tandy suspected that\n\nMacDonald  had  stolen  money  from the  store's  cash  register.\n\nMacDonald  brought an  action  against Tandy,  alleging  wrongful\n\ndischarge under New Hampshire law.  MacDonald  claimed that Tandy\n\nfired  him   because  he   had  cooperated  with   Tandy's  theft\n\ninvestigation.       Cooperation   with   an   employer's   theft\n\ninvestigation, according  to MacDonald,  is conduct  protected by\n\nNew  Hampshire public  policy.   Therefore, MacDonald  argued his\n\nfiring was unlawful under New Hampshire law.\n\n          The  action went to trial  before a jury  in the United\n\nStates District Court  for the  District of New  Hampshire.   The\n\njury returned a  verdict in  MacDonald's favor in  the amount  of\n\n$101,000 damages.  Tandy  moved for a judgment n.o.v. and, in the\n\nalternative,  a new  trial.   The district court  granted Tandy's\n\nfirst motion, and  entered a  judgment n.o.v..   The court  found\n\nthat  MacDonald had failed to show that his conduct was protected\n\nby public policy.  The court also found that, even if MacDonald's\n\nconduct  was indeed  protected  by public  policy, MacDonald  had\n\nfailed  to  show  that he  was  fired  because  of the  protected\n\nconduct.  \n\n          MacDonald now appeals.  Because we agree that MacDonald\n\nfailed to show that he was fired because of conduct  protected by\n\nNew Hampshire public policy, we  will affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of judgment n.o.v. in favor of Tandy.\n\n                                I.\n\n          John J. MacDonald (MacDonald), who had been employed by\n\nTandy  Corporation (owner  of  the Radio  Shack  stores) for  six\n\nyears, was working as a trainee at the Radio  Shack store located\n\nin a shopping mall in  Manchester, New Hampshire.  On  October 1,\n\n1986, the store was closed at 9:43 p.m. by three Tandy employees,\n\nDavid Jesperson  (Jesperson),  Al Aikens  (Aikens),  and  Shirley\n\nCunningham (Cunningham).  Jesperson, Aikens, and Cunningham  left\n\nthe store together.   As they left,  the three employees set  the\n\nstore's electronically controlled motion detection alarms.\n\n          At 9:47 p.m., Eastern Alarm,  telephonically monitoring\n\nthe alarms from its offices in Portland, Maine, received a motion\n\nalarm emanating from the Radio Shack store.  Eastern Alarm called\n\nthe Manchester Radio Shack store by telephone but did not receive\n\nan  answer.   Eastern Alarm  received a  second motion  alarm two\n\nminutes later.   Eastern Alarm then called  the Manchester Police\n\nDepartment  which dispatched a police unit to the store.  Eastern\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nAlarm also  called the  store manager, Brad  Ackerman (Ackerman),\n\nbut  was unable  to reach  him.   Eastern Alarm  therefore called\n\nMacDonald, the second person on the Radio Shack list of employees\n\nto  be called.  In response to  the call, MacDonald left home and\n\ncame to  the Radio Shack  store, arriving at  approximately 10:35\n\np.m.    In  his  work  with  Tandy  Corporation,   MacDonald  had\n\npreviously responded to over thirty such alarm calls.\n\n          When  MacDonald arrived,  he was  met by  mall security\n\npersonnel  and informed that the  doors to the  store were secure\n\nand that it was safe  to enter.  MacDonald used a key supplied to\n\nhim  by the  store  manager  and entered  the  store alone.    He\n\nremained alone in  the store for approximately  fifteen minutes. \n\nMacDonald reset the alarm, put a few things in order for the next\n\nday, locked the front door, and left.\n\n          On the morning of October 2, 1986, MacDonald  also came\n\nin alone to open up the store for the day's  business.  MacDonald\n\ndiscovered $530.02,  including $200.00  petty cash,  missing from\n\none  of two  cash  drawers.   He  immediately notified  Ackerman.\n\nMacDonald also  informed Bill Hanlon (Hanlon),  a loss prevention\n\nmanager for Tandy Corporation, of the missing funds.\n\n          The police  arrived and questioned  MacDonald.   Later,\n\nboth   Ackerman  and   Hanlon  arrived   and  began   a  separate\n\ninterrogation.   They  questioned Jesperson,  Aikens, Cunningham,\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nand MacDonald individually.   MacDonald  stated that  he did  not\n\nobserve, either on the evening of October 1, 1986 or  the morning\n\nof October 2, 1986, when he opened the store, any signs of forced\n\nentry,  with  respect to  the  rear or  front doors  or  the cash\n\ndrawers.  MacDonald also  stated that he  \"did not notice if  the\n\ncash drawer was open  when he went to  the store on the night  of\n\nOctober 1, 1986.\"  \n\n          During MacDonald's questioning, the subject of taking a\n\npolygraph examination was raised.   At trial, MacDonald testified\n\nthat  he understood that Tandy  wanted him to  take the polygraph\n\nand that  Tandy planned to set  up the polygraph  exam.  Further,\n\nMacDonald  understood that he would lose his career with Tandy if\n\nhe  did not  accede  to  the  polygraph.   On  October  9,  1986,\n\nMacDonald  went  to  the  Manchester Police  Department  for  the\n\npurpose  of taking  a  polygraph examination  with regard  to the\n\nmissing funds.  Officer  Anthony Fowler conducted the examination\n\nand scored it as  a three chart cumulative total of -17 deceptive\n\nand two chart cumulative  total of -10 deceptive.   In substance,\n\nthe  conclusion  was that  MacDonald was  not telling  the truth.\n\nMacDonald  informed  Radio  Shack  personnel  of   the  polygraph\n\nresults.\n\n          On October 21,  1986, the home  office of Tandy  issued\n\norders that MacDonald  was to be discharged.  The  reason for his\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nseparation was stated  as follows:   \"failed  to clear  integrity\n\ninvestigation.   See Loss  Prevention Report and  Manchester, New\n\nHampshire Police  Report for  details.\"  Tandy's  Loss Prevention\n\nReport,  prepared  by  Hanlon,  noted the  circumstances  of  the\n\ndisappearance of the money and that MacDonald had failed to clear\n\nthe polygraph test.  \n\n          As  noted above, the action  went to a  jury trial, the\n\njury returned a  verdict in  MacDonald's favor in  the amount  of\n\n$101,000 damages, and the  defendant moved for a judgment  n.o.v.\n\nThe district court then  certified the following question  to the\n\nNew Hampshire Supreme Court:  \n\n          Do the facts and circumstances of this action\n          support   a   finding   that  public   policy\n          encouraged  the action  of the  plaintiff, or\n          does public  policy condemn any  action which\n          the  plaintiff refused to  take in connection\n          with   the   termination   of   his   at-will\n          employment by the defendant?\n\nAfter the New Hampshire Supreme Court declined to respond to this\n\ncertified  question, the  district court  granted the  motion for\n\njudgment n.o.v..\n\n          The district  court reasoned that the  record failed to\n\nshow  that  Tandy  decided  to  terminate MacDonald's  employment\n\nbecause  he cooperated  in Tandy's  investigation of  the missing\n\nfunds.  The court also reasoned that MacDonald's action in taking\n\nthe polygraph was not in  cooperation with an investigation being\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nconducted by his employer  but was rather in cooperation  with an\n\ninvestigation   being   conducted   by   the   Manchester  Police\n\nDepartment.\n\n                               II.\n\n          The  district  court  had subject  matter  jurisdiction\n\npursuant  to 28  U.S.C.  1332.   We  have  appellate jurisdiction\n\nprusuant  to 28 U.S.C.  1291.   In the  First Circuit, a judgment\n\nn.o.v. is reviewed under the same standard as a directed verdict:\n\n          [T]he evidence and all  reasonable inferences\n          extractable therefrom must be examined in the\n          light most  favorable to the nonmovant  and a\n          judgment  notwithstanding the  verdict should\n          be  granted only  when  the evidence,  viewed\n          from   this   perspective,   is   such   that\n          reasonable  persons  could   reach  but   one\n          conclusion.\n\nVeranda Beach Club Ltd.

First, the  plaintiff must show that\n          the  defendant was  motivated  by bad  faith,\n          malice,  or  retaliation  in terminating  the\n          plaintiff's  employment.  . .  .  Second, the\n          plaintiff  must  demonstrate   that  he   was\n          discharged  because he performed  an act that\n          public  policy would encourage, or refused to\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\n          do   something   that  public   policy  would\n          condemn.\n\nCloutier  v. Great  Atlantic &amp;  Pacific Tea  Co., 436  A.2d 1140,\n                                                \n\n1143-44 (N.H. 1981); accord  Short v. School Admin.

We believe it best to\n          allow the citizenry, through  the institution\n          of   the   American  jury,   to   strike  the\n          appropriate balance in these difficult cases.\n\nCloutier, 436 A.2d at 1145.  However, the jury's determination is\n        \n\nnot entirely  without bounds.  \"Although ordinarily  the issue of\n\nwhether a  public policy exists  is a  question for the  jury, at\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\ntimes the presence or absence of such a public policy is so clear\n\nthat  a court may rule  on its existence  as a matter  of law and\n\ntake the question away from the jury.\"  Short, 612 A.2d at 370.\n                                             \n\n          Even  if  the  alleged  conduct  is  determined  to  be\n\nprotected  by  a  public  policy,  a  necessary  element  of  the\n\nplaintiff's  case is  to  prove  that  he  or  she  was  actually\n\ndischarged  because of such conduct.  Thus, a causal link between\n\nthe  conduct established to be protected by public policy and the\n\nreason  for  the allegedly  wrongful  discharge  is necessary  to\n\nsatisfy  the second prong of the New  Hampshire test.  As the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court stated:  \n\n          [T]he plaintiff must  demonstrate that he was\n          discharged  because he performed  an act that\n                             \n          public  policy would encourage, or refused to\n          do   something   that  public   policy  would\n          condemn.  \n\nCloutier, 436 A.2d at  1144 (emphasis added).  Where  an employer\n        \n\nessentially  penalized the  employee  for  taking  his  regularly\n\nscheduled  day off, the  court found \"a  sufficient nexus between\n\nthe public policy asserted  by the plaintiff and the  reasons for\n\nhis  discharge.\"  Id. at  1141; see also  Cilley v. New Hampshire\n                                                                 \n\nBall Bearings,  Inc., 514  A.2d 818, 821  (N.H. 1986)  (causation\n                    \n\nelement  satisfied where  plaintiff  had alleged  his termination\n\nresulted  from refusing  to lie and  that public  policy supports\n\nsuch truthfulness).\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\n          In this case,  we agree  with the  district court  that\n\nthere  is  no evidence  on this  record  to demonstrate  that the\n\nplaintiff was discharged because of conduct protected by a public\n\npolicy.   The specific public  policy asserted by  MacDonald as a\n\njustification  for  upholding  the  jury's  verdict  is  that  of\n\n\"cooperation   with   an   employer's  theft   investigation.\"   \n\nInterpreted in the  light most favorable to MacDonald, the record\n\nshows  that MacDonald was  suspected of  stealing money  from his\n\nemployer,  cooperated in  the employer's  investigation,  was not\n\ncleared by the investigation, and was  terminated.  MacDonald was\n\nsuspected  of  stealing  the  cash  from  Tandy  because  of  the\n\ncircumstances under  which the  money was  taken from  the store.\n\nMacDonald   then   cooperated    with   his   employer's    theft\n\ninvestigation,  the result  of which  did nothing  to dispel  his\n\nemployer's suspicions.   We believe  the district court  drew the\n\nonly possible  interpretation from these facts  when it concluded\n\nthat MacDonald was dismissed because of the opportunity he had to\n\nsteal the money and because he was not  cleared by the subsequent\n\ninvestigation and  not because he cooperated  with his employer's\n\ntheft  investigation.   What is  missing from  the record  is any\n\nevidence  to  indicate  that   MacDonald  was  fired  because  he\n\ncooperated with the employer's theft investigation.\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\n          Without such causal linkage, MacDonald cannot assert an\n\nexception to the  at-will employment doctrine.  We  cannot accept\n\nMacDonald's suggestion  that his cooperation with  his employer's\n\ninvestigation   immunizes   him   from  the   findings   of   the\n\ninvestigation.  It  would defy logic if an  employee by reason of\n\ncooperation  could be absolutely  protected from the consequences\n\nof the facts  the cooperation yields.   While it  may not be  the\n\nbest of business practice,  a company is within its  legal rights\n\nto  fire  employees  on  such  slender  evidence  indicating  the\n\npossibility of  theft as is  offered in  the present  case.

This is an appeal\n                                            \n\nfrom a grant  of a judgment  n.o.v. in favor of  defendant, Tandy\n\nCorporation, and against plaintiff, John J. MacDonald.  MacDonald\n\nwas fired from  his job as  a sales-trainee at  a store owned  by\n\nTandy in  Manchester, New Hampshire because  Tandy suspected that\n\nMacDonald  had  stolen  money  from the  store's  cash  register.\n\nMacDonald  brought an  action  against Tandy,  alleging  wrongful\n\ndischarge under New Hampshire law.  MacDonald  claimed that Tandy\n\nfired  him   because  he   had  cooperated  with   Tandy's  theft\n\ninvestigation.       Cooperation   with   an   employer's   theft\n\ninvestigation, according  to MacDonald,  is conduct  protected by\n\nNew  Hampshire public  policy.   Therefore, MacDonald  argued his\n\nfiring was unlawful under New Hampshire law.\n\n          The  action went to trial  before a jury  in the United\n\nStates District Court  for the  District of New  Hampshire.   The\n\njury returned a  verdict in  MacDonald's favor in  the amount  of\n\n$101,000 damages.  Tandy  moved for a judgment n.o.v. and, in the\n\nalternative,  a new  trial.   The district court  granted Tandy's\n\nfirst motion, and  entered a  judgment n.o.v..   The court  found\n\nthat  MacDonald had failed to show that his conduct was protected\n\nby public policy.  The court also found that, even if MacDonald's\n\nconduct  was indeed  protected  by public  policy, MacDonald  had\n\nfailed  to  show  that he  was  fired  because  of the  protected\n\nconduct.  \n\n          MacDonald now appeals.  Because we agree that MacDonald\n\nfailed to show that he was fired because of conduct  protected by\n\nNew Hampshire public policy, we  will affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of judgment n.o.v. in favor of Tandy.\n\n                                I.\n\n          John J. MacDonald (MacDonald), who had been employed by\n\nTandy  Corporation (owner  of  the Radio  Shack  stores) for  six\n\nyears, was working as a trainee at the Radio  Shack store located\n\nin a shopping mall in  Manchester, New Hampshire.  On  October 1,\n\n1986, the store was closed at 9:43 p.m. by three Tandy employees,\n\nDavid Jesperson  (Jesperson),  Al Aikens  (Aikens),  and  Shirley\n\nCunningham (Cunningham).  Jesperson, Aikens, and Cunningham  left\n\nthe store together.   As they left,  the three employees set  the\n\nstore's electronically controlled motion detection alarms.\n\n          At 9:47 p.m., Eastern Alarm,  telephonically monitoring\n\nthe alarms from its offices in Portland, Maine, received a motion\n\nalarm emanating from the Radio Shack store.  Eastern Alarm called\n\nthe Manchester Radio Shack store by telephone but did not receive\n\nan  answer.   Eastern Alarm  received a  second motion  alarm two\n\nminutes later.   Eastern Alarm then called  the Manchester Police\n\nDepartment  which dispatched a police unit to the store.  Eastern\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nAlarm also  called the  store manager, Brad  Ackerman (Ackerman),\n\nbut  was unable  to reach  him.   Eastern Alarm  therefore called\n\nMacDonald, the second person on the Radio Shack list of employees\n\nto  be called.  In response to  the call, MacDonald left home and\n\ncame to  the Radio Shack  store, arriving at  approximately 10:35\n\np.m.    In  his  work  with  Tandy  Corporation,   MacDonald  had\n\npreviously responded to over thirty such alarm calls.\n\n          When  MacDonald arrived,  he was  met by  mall security\n\npersonnel  and informed that the  doors to the  store were secure\n\nand that it was safe  to enter.  MacDonald used a key supplied to\n\nhim  by the  store  manager  and entered  the  store alone.    He\n\nremained alone in  the store for approximately  fifteen minutes. \n\nMacDonald reset the alarm, put a few things in order for the next\n\nday, locked the front door, and left.\n\n          On the morning of October 2, 1986, MacDonald  also came\n\nin alone to open up the store for the day's  business.  MacDonald\n\ndiscovered $530.02,  including $200.00  petty cash,  missing from\n\none  of two  cash  drawers.   He  immediately notified  Ackerman.\n\nMacDonald also  informed Bill Hanlon (Hanlon),  a loss prevention\n\nmanager for Tandy Corporation, of the missing funds.\n\n          The police  arrived and questioned  MacDonald.   Later,\n\nboth   Ackerman  and   Hanlon  arrived   and  began   a  separate\n\ninterrogation.   They  questioned Jesperson,  Aikens, Cunningham,\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nand MacDonald individually.   MacDonald  stated that  he did  not\n\nobserve, either on the evening of October 1, 1986 or  the morning\n\nof October 2, 1986, when he opened the store, any signs of forced\n\nentry,  with  respect to  the  rear or  front doors  or  the cash\n\ndrawers.  MacDonald also  stated that he  \"did not notice if  the\n\ncash drawer was open  when he went to  the store on the night  of\n\nOctober 1, 1986.\"  \n\n          During MacDonald's questioning, the subject of taking a\n\npolygraph examination was raised.   At trial, MacDonald testified\n\nthat  he understood that Tandy  wanted him to  take the polygraph\n\nand that  Tandy planned to set  up the polygraph  exam.  Further,\n\nMacDonald  understood that he would lose his career with Tandy if\n\nhe  did not  accede  to  the  polygraph.   On  October  9,  1986,\n\nMacDonald  went  to  the  Manchester Police  Department  for  the\n\npurpose  of taking  a  polygraph examination  with regard  to the\n\nmissing funds.  Officer  Anthony Fowler conducted the examination\n\nand scored it as  a three chart cumulative total of -17 deceptive\n\nand two chart cumulative  total of -10 deceptive.   In substance,\n\nthe  conclusion  was that  MacDonald was  not telling  the truth.\n\nMacDonald  informed  Radio  Shack  personnel  of   the  polygraph\n\nresults.\n\n          On October 21,  1986, the home  office of Tandy  issued\n\norders that MacDonald  was to be discharged.  The  reason for his\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nseparation was stated  as follows:   \"failed  to clear  integrity\n\ninvestigation.   See Loss  Prevention Report and  Manchester, New\n\nHampshire Police  Report for  details.\"  Tandy's  Loss Prevention\n\nReport,  prepared  by  Hanlon,  noted the  circumstances  of  the\n\ndisappearance of the money and that MacDonald had failed to clear\n\nthe polygraph test.  \n\n          As  noted above, the action  went to a  jury trial, the\n\njury returned a  verdict in  MacDonald's favor in  the amount  of\n\n$101,000 damages, and the  defendant moved for a judgment  n.o.v.\n\nThe district court then  certified the following question  to the\n\nNew Hampshire Supreme Court:  \n\n          Do the facts and circumstances of this action\n          support   a   finding   that  public   policy\n          encouraged  the action  of the  plaintiff, or\n          does public  policy condemn any  action which\n          the  plaintiff refused to  take in connection\n          with   the   termination   of   his   at-will\n          employment by the defendant?\n\nAfter the New Hampshire Supreme Court declined to respond to this\n\ncertified  question, the  district court  granted the  motion for\n\njudgment n.o.v..\n\n          The district  court reasoned that the  record failed to\n\nshow  that  Tandy  decided  to  terminate MacDonald's  employment\n\nbecause  he cooperated  in Tandy's  investigation of  the missing\n\nfunds.  The court also reasoned that MacDonald's action in taking\n\nthe polygraph was not in  cooperation with an investigation being\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nconducted by his employer  but was rather in cooperation  with an\n\ninvestigation   being   conducted   by   the   Manchester  Police\n\nDepartment.\n\n                               II.\n\n          The  district  court  had subject  matter  jurisdiction\n\npursuant  to 28  U.S.C.  1332.   We  have  appellate jurisdiction\n\nprusuant  to 28 U.S.C.  1291.   In the  First Circuit, a judgment\n\nn.o.v. is reviewed under the same standard as a directed verdict:\n\n          [T]he evidence and all  reasonable inferences\n          extractable therefrom must be examined in the\n          light most  favorable to the nonmovant  and a\n          judgment  notwithstanding the  verdict should\n          be  granted only  when  the evidence,  viewed\n          from   this   perspective,   is   such   that\n          reasonable  persons  could   reach  but   one\n          conclusion.\n\nVeranda Beach Club Ltd.

We believe it best to\n          allow the citizenry, through  the institution\n          of   the   American  jury,   to   strike  the\n          appropriate balance in these difficult cases.\n\nCloutier, 436 A.2d at 1145.  However, the jury's determination is\n        \n\nnot entirely  without bounds.  \"Although ordinarily  the issue of\n\nwhether a  public policy exists  is a  question for the  jury, at\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\ntimes the presence or absence of such a public policy is so clear\n\nthat  a court may rule  on its existence  as a matter  of law and\n\ntake the question away from the jury.\"  Short, 612 A.2d at 370.\n                                             \n\n          Even  if  the  alleged  conduct  is  determined  to  be\n\nprotected  by  a  public  policy,  a  necessary  element  of  the\n\nplaintiff's  case is  to  prove  that  he  or  she  was  actually\n\ndischarged  because of such conduct.  Thus, a causal link between\n\nthe  conduct established to be protected by public policy and the\n\nreason  for  the allegedly  wrongful  discharge  is necessary  to\n\nsatisfy  the second prong of the New  Hampshire test.  As the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court stated:  \n\n          [T]he plaintiff must  demonstrate that he was\n          discharged  because he performed  an act that\n                             \n          public  policy would encourage, or refused to\n          do   something   that  public   policy  would\n          condemn.  \n\nCloutier, 436 A.2d at  1144 (emphasis added).  Where  an employer\n        \n\nessentially  penalized the  employee  for  taking  his  regularly\n\nscheduled  day off, the  court found \"a  sufficient nexus between\n\nthe public policy asserted  by the plaintiff and the  reasons for\n\nhis  discharge.\"  Id. at  1141; see also  Cilley v.

The specific public  policy asserted by  MacDonald as a\n\njustification  for  upholding  the  jury's  verdict  is  that  of\n\n\"cooperation   with   an   employer's  theft   investigation.\"   \n\nInterpreted in the  light most favorable to MacDonald, the record\n\nshows  that MacDonald was  suspected of  stealing money  from his\n\nemployer,  cooperated in  the employer's  investigation,  was not\n\ncleared by the investigation, and was  terminated.  MacDonald was\n\nsuspected  of  stealing  the  cash  from  Tandy  because  of  the\n\ncircumstances under  which the  money was  taken from  the store.\n\nMacDonald   then   cooperated    with   his   employer's    theft\n\ninvestigation,  the result  of which  did nothing  to dispel  his\n\nemployer's suspicions.   We believe  the district court  drew the\n\nonly possible  interpretation from these facts  when it concluded\n\nthat MacDonald was dismissed because of the opportunity he had to\n\nsteal the money and because he was not  cleared by the subsequent\n\ninvestigation and  not because he cooperated  with his employer's\n\ntheft  investigation.   What is  missing from  the record  is any\n\nevidence  to  indicate  that   MacDonald  was  fired  because  he\n\ncooperated with the employer's theft investigation.\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\n          Without such causal linkage, MacDonald cannot assert an\n\nexception to the  at-will employment doctrine.  We  cannot accept\n\nMacDonald's suggestion  that his cooperation with  his employer's\n\ninvestigation   immunizes   him   from  the   findings   of   the\n\ninvestigation.  It  would defy logic if an  employee by reason of\n\ncooperation  could be absolutely  protected from the consequences\n\nof the facts  the cooperation yields.   While it  may not be  the\n\nbest of business practice,  a company is within its  legal rights\n\nto  fire  employees  on  such  slender  evidence  indicating  the\n\npossibility of  theft as is  offered in  the present  case.
