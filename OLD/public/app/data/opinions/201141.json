The question on appeal\n\nis whether the Barton doctrine bars the bringing of this action in\n\nthe federal district court against a bankruptcy trustee without the\n\nprior permission of the bankruptcy court.                 The district court\n\ndismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction,\n\nand we affirm.\n\n                                     FACTS\n\n           The following facts, except a few that are undisputed,\n\nare all alleged in Muratore's amended complaint.                    Plaintiff-\n\nappellant, Joseph R. Muratore, Sr. owned and controlled Columbus\n\nMortgage Company, Inc.      (Referred to herein as the \"debtor\").           On\n\nFebruary 15, 1991, the debtor filed a voluntary petition for\n\nreorganization     under   Chapter    11    of   the   Bankruptcy   Code.    On\n\nDecember 23, 1991, the bankruptcy court granted the U.S. Trustee's\n\napplication to employ defendant-appellee, Stephen Darr, as trustee.\n\nOn July 18, 1996, the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming\n\nthe Plan of Reorganization.          Approximately four years later, the\n\nbankruptcy court entered orders granting Darr's application for\n\nfinal decree and approving his application for final compensation.\n\nMuratore   filed    objections   to     these     applications,     which   the\n\nbankruptcy court considered and denied.            Muratore did not appeal.\n\nThe bankruptcy court closed the case on November 9, 2000.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f             In   September   of    2002,    Muratore       brought    the   instant\n\nlawsuit against Darr, in Darr's capacity as trustee, in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Rhode Island.\n\n            On September 30, 2002, apparently without relation to\n\nMuratore's    present     action,   the     bankruptcy       court    reopened    the\n\nbankruptcy proceedings, and they were still open on October 18,\n\n2002 when Muratore amended his complaint herein.1\n\n             In Count I of his amended complaint, Muratore alleged\n\nthat Darr \"did not faithfully perform the duties of his office and\n\ncommitted     acts   of    misfeasance      [and/or]        malfeasance      in   the\n\nperformance of his duties in that . . . \":\n\n             1.      he did not pay taxes and, as a result, lost six\n\n                     properties at tax sale;\n\n             2.      he   defectively       sold   at   a    foreclosure      rental\n\n                     properties,      generating        three    additional       law\n\n                     suits;\n\n             3.      he   defectively       sold   at   a    foreclosure      income\n\n                     properties,      generating        three    additional       law\n\n                     suits;\n\n             4.      he failed to file corporate returns, resulting in\n\n                     forfeiture of charter and causing real estate to\n\n                     revert to stockholders;\n\n\n     1\n      The reopening of the bankruptcy case was to allow Darr to\nexecute a release of mortgage after the underlying debt was paid.\nThe bankruptcy case was closed again on November 25, 2002.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f          5.          he failed to file tax returns to the Rhode Island\n\n                      Tax Administrator, resulting in the denial of\n\n                      issuance of letters of good standing, causing\n\n                      defective     titles    and    defeating     transfer    of\n\n                      titles; and\n\n          6.          purchases of some properties were procured with\n\n                      funds from the Gambino family in violation of 18\n\n                      U.S.C. § 1956.\n\nIn Count II, Muratore alleged that Darr committed abuse of process\n\nby committing waste so egregious that his advisors and/or employees\n\nused Chapter 11 protection procedures to put Muratore out of\n\nbusiness rather than to assist in reorganizing Muratore's business.\n\nHe   further    alleged     that    \"such    use    of   his    [Darr's]   powers\n\nconstitutes     use    of   judicial    appointment       and    proceedings   in\n\nbankruptcy for an ulterior purpose, to wit, to make it impossible\n\nfor Muratore to conduct business and to earn a living from his\n\nbusiness.\"     In Count III, Muratore alleged that Darr was negligent\n\nbecause he breached his duty to protect the assets of the trust and\n\nto serve the trust with diligence.            In Count IV, Muratore alleged\n\nthat the purchase of certain trust property was financed either\n\ndirectly or indirectly by funds obtained from the illegal interests\n\nand enterprises of a notorious crime family in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f             Muratore neither obtained leave of the bankruptcy court\n\nnor    sought    bankruptcy     court   authority       before    commencing    this\n\nlawsuit in the district court. Citing Muratore's failure to obtain\n\nsuch authority, Darr moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of\n\nsubject-matter      jurisdiction.         The    district    court    allowed    the\n\nmotion.      Muratore appeals from the dismissal.\n\n                                   Discussion\n\n              \"We review 'the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,\n\ntaking the allegations in the complaint as true and making all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff.'\" Doran v. Mass. Tpk.\n\nAuth., 348 F.3d 315, 318 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Rockwell v. Cape\n\nCod Hosp., 26 F.3d 254, 255 (1st Cir. 1994)).                    The central issue\n\nhere    is    whether   the      district       court    lacked     subject-matter\n\njurisdiction because of Muratore's failure to have obtained leave\n\nfrom the bankruptcy court to bring this action in the former court.\n\nIn determining whether a complaint alleges sufficient facts to\n\nestablish       jurisdiction,    we     read    the     complaint    holistically.\n\nLeblanc v. Salem (In re Mailman Steam Carpet Cleaning Corp.), 196\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n             In Barton v. Barbour, the Supreme Court ruled that the\n\ncommon law barred suits against receivers in courts other than the\n\ncourt charged with the administration of the estate. 104 U.S. 126,\n\n127 (1881).       The Supreme Court ruled that before suit is brought\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fagainst a receiver, leave of the court by which the trustee was\n\nappointed must be obtained.   The Court stated:\n\n          So, in cases of bankruptcy, many incidental\n          questions arise in the course of administering\n          the bankrupt estate, which would ordinarily be\n          pure cases at law, and in respect of their\n          facts triable by jury, but, as belonging to\n          the bankruptcy proceedings, they become cases\n          over which the bankruptcy court, which acts as\n          a court of equity, exercises exclusive\n          control.\n\nId. at 134; see also Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 337 (1966).\n\n\"Barton involved a receiver in state court, but the circuit courts\n\nhave extended the Barton doctrine to lawsuits against a bankruptcy\n\ntrustee.\" Carter v. Rodgers, 220 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir. 2000).\n\n          A limited exception to the rule announced in Barton was\n\ncodified in 28 U.S.C. § 959(a).    See, e.g., Allard v. Weitzman (In\n\nre DeLorean Motor Co.), 991 F.2d 1236, 1240-41 (6th Cir. 1993)\n\n(describing 959(a) exception as \"limited\"). Section 959(a) states:\n\n          [t]rustees, receivers or managers of any\n          property, including debtors in possession, may\n          be sued, without leave of the court appointing\n          them, with respect to any of their acts or\n          transactions in carrying on business connected\n          with such property.    Such actions shall be\n          subject to the general equity power of such\n          court so far as the same may be necessary to\n          the ends of justice, but this shall not\n          deprive a litigant of his right to trial by\n          jury.\n\nMuratore argues that section 959(a) applies here.    In considering\n\nthis argument, we must ascertain whether Muratore's claims apply to\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthe   trustee's     \"acts   or     transactions   in   carrying   on   business\n\nconnected with\" the bankruptcy estate.\n\n             There is little First Circuit case law on this issue, but\n\ncourts elsewhere have interpreted \"acts or transactions in carrying\n\non business connected with\" the bankruptcy estate to mean acts or\n\ntransactions in conducting the debtor's business in the ordinary\n\nsense of the words or in pursuing that business as an operating\n\nenterprise.       See, e.g., Melvin v. Klein, 266 N.Y.S. 2d 533, 536-37\n\n(N.Y.     Spec.    Term   1965).      In   interpreting    section     959(a)'s\n\npredecessor, 28 U.S.C. § 125,2 Learned Hand, writing for the Second\n\nCircuit, concluded that \"[m]erely to hold matters in statu quo; to\n\nmark time, as it were; to do only what is necessary to hold the\n\nassets intact; such activities\" did not constitute carrying on\n\nbusiness.     Vass v. Conron Bros. Co., 59 F.2d 969, 971 (2d Cir.\n\n1932).     Rather, section 959(a) \"is intended to 'permit actions\n\nredressing torts committed in furtherance of the debtor's business,\n\nsuch as the common situation of a negligence claim in a slip and\n\nfall case where a bankruptcy trustee, for example, conducted a\n\n\n\n      2\n      The predecessor to the section 959(a) exception, 28 U.S.C. §\n125, was nearly identical:\n     Every receiver or manager of any property appointed by\n     any court of the United States may be sued in respect of\n     any act or transaction of his in carrying on the business\n     connected with such property, without the previous leave\n     of the court in which such receiver or manager was\n     appointed . . . .\nAccordingly, we do not distinguish between cases that concern\nsection 959(a) and those that concern 28 U.S.C. § 125.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fretail store.'\"       Carter, 220 F.3d at 1254 (quoting Lebovits v.\n\nScheffel (In re Lehal Realty Assocs.), 101 F.3d 272, 276 (2d Cir.\n\n1996)).\n\n             For example, section 959(a) applied where a trustee\n\ncontinued the business of a debtor in operating a railroad, and the\n\ntrustee had been sued in his representative capacity for damages\n\nfor use of another's tracks, Thompson v. Texas Mexican Ry. Co., 328\n\nU.S. 134, 138 (1946) (applying predecessor to section 959(a)), and\n\nin a case for wrongful death and injury resulting to a member of\n\nthe public in a grade crossing accident, Valdes v. Feliciano, 267\n\nF.2d 91, 94-95 (1st Cir. 1959).       Also, the exception has been held\n\nto apply to an employee's claims arising from injuries caused by\n\noverwork at a railroad company operated by the trustee and the\n\ntrustee's withholding of an employee's pension.                 Haberern v.\n\nLehigh and New England Ry., Co., 554 F.2d 581, 585 (3d Cir. 1981).\n\n             On the other hand, courts have concluded that merely\n\nholding and collecting the assets intact, Vass, 59 F.2d at 971,\n\ncollecting and liquidating the assets of the debtor, Austrian v.\n\nWilliams, 216 F.2d 278, 285 (2d Cir. 1954), and taking steps for\n\nthe care and preservation of the property, U. and I., Inc. v.\n\nFitzgerald, (In the Matter of Campbell), 13 B.R. 974, 976 (Bankr.\n\nD. Idaho 1981), In re Kalb & Berger Mfg. Co., 165 F. 895, 896-97\n\n(2d   Cir.   1908),    do   not   constitute   \"carrying   on    business.\"\n\nLikewise, actions taken in the mere continuous administration of\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fproperty under order of the court do not constitute an \"act\" or\n\n\"transaction\" in carrying on business connected with the estate.\n\nField v. Kansas City Refining Co., 9 F.2d 213, 216 (8th Cir. 1925);\n\nsee also In re DeLorean Motor Co., 991 F.2d at 1241 (action against\n\ntrustee and representatives alleging abuse of process and malicious\n\nprosecution in relation to prosecution of fraudulent conveyance\n\naction is a suit for actions of trustee wholly unrelated to\n\ncarrying on debtor's business because trustee merely collected,\n\ntook steps to preserve, and/or held assets, as well as performed\n\nother aspects of administering and liquidating estate); Carter, 220\n\nF.3d at 1254.\n\n            We agree with the district court that section 959(a) does\n\nnot apply here.    In his brief, Muratore represents that he was in\n\nthe business of \"leasing to commercial and residential tenants, and\n\nall required acts associated with maintaining such leases.\"      His\n\ncomplaint, however, does not specify the nature of the businesses\n\nat issue. Darr contends that Muratore's business was actually \"the\n\nmaking of mortgage loans.\"      We need not, however, resolve this\n\nquestion.     The allegations in the complaint focus upon Darr's\n\nactions in the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of his fiduciary\n\nresponsibilities as trustee, as opposed to acts or transactions in\n\nthe furtherance of Muratore's business whatever it was.       See 11\n\nU.S.C. § 959(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f             The accounting for and sale of property, the filing of\n\ntax returns, and the payment of taxes were among Darr's statutory\n\nresponsibilities and powers as a Chapter 11 trustee.        11 U.S.C. §§\n\n363 & 1106;3 see also Holywell Corp. v. Smith, 503 U.S. 47, 52-56\n\n(1992) (Chapter 11 trustee is required to file tax returns and pay\n\ntaxes with respect to the debtor).          Indeed, Muratore does not\n\nappear to dispute that Darr had these responsibilities; rather, he\n\nargues     that   Darr   did   not   adequately   respond   to   them   --\n\n\n     3\n         11 U.S.C. § 363 states:\n             (b) (1) The trustee, after notice and a\n             hearing, may use, sell, or lease, other than\n             in the ordinary course of business, property\n             of the estate . . . .\n             (c) (1) If the business of the debtor is\n             authorized to be operated under section 721,\n             1108, 1203, 1204, or 1304 of this title and\n             unless the court orders otherwise, the trustee\n             may enter into transactions, including the\n             sale or lease of property of the estate, in\n             the ordinary course of business, without\n             notice or a hearing, and may use property of\n             the estate in the ordinary course of business\n             without notice or a hearing . . . .\n\n11 U.S.C. § 1106 states:\n          (a) A trustee shall--\n          . . .\n          (6) for any year for which the debtor has not\n          filed a tax return required by law, furnish,\n          without personal liability, such information\n          as may be required by the governmental unit\n          with which such tax return was to be filed, in\n          light of the condition of the debtor's books\n          and records and the availability of such\n          information; and\n          (7) after confirmation of a plan, file such\n          reports as are necessary or as the court\n          orders . . . .\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fspecifically, that Darr did not liquidate the properties quickly\n\nenough, improperly liquidated the properties, and did not pay taxes\n\nor file tax returns.\n\n           The different counts in Muratore's complaint all allege\n\nDarr's misconduct     in   discharging      his   trustee's   administrative\n\nresponsibilities.     Count I alleges that Darr did not \"faithfully\n\nperform the duties of his office\" when he performed improper\n\nliquidations, failed to file tax returns and pay taxes, and allowed\n\nthe purchase of property with illegal funds.            Counts II, III, and\n\nIV merely reiterate these allegations within claims for \"abuse of\n\nprocess,\" \"negligence,\" and violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968\n\nrespectively.4     These allegations are very similar to ones made in\n\nother cases holding the 959(a) exception did not apply.              Carter,\n\n220 F.3d at 1254 (holding section 959(a) exception did not apply to\n\nclaims   arising    from   Chapter    7     trustee's   allegedly   improper\n\nliquidation of estate assets at auction)5; In re DeLorean Motor\n\nCo., 991 F.2d at 1240-41 (holding section 959(a) did not apply to\n\naction against Chapter 7 trustee and representatives alleging abuse\n\n\n     4\n      Muratore does not appear to argue that the exception to the\nBarton doctrine applies to Count IV.\n     5\n      For present purposes, we do not distinguish between cases\ninvolving Chapter 11 trustees and those involving Chapter 7\ntrustees. See Corzin v. Fordu (In re Fordu), 201 F.3d 693, 706\nn.18 (6th Cir. 1999) (stating, \"[t]he duties and responsibilities\nof either a Chapter 11 trustee or debtor-in-possession as a\nfiduciary for the bankruptcy estate are virtually the same as those\nimposed on a Chapter 7 trustee.\").\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fof process and malicious prosecution in relation to prosecution of\n\nfraudulent conveyance action); Austrian, 216 F.2d at 285 (holding\n\nin Chapter 11 case that section 959(a) did not apply and stating,\n\n\"[m]erely to attempt to collect and liquidate the assets of a\n\ndebtor is not to carry on its business in any proper sense of the\n\nterm.\") (citations omitted); Kashani v. Fulton (In re Kashani), 190\n\nB.R. 875, 884-85 (9th Cir. B.A.P. 1995) (holding section 959(a) did\n\nnot apply to breach of fiduciary duty and negligence claims arising\n\nfrom, inter alia, Chapter 11 trustee's failure to sell or attempt\n\nto sell estate property in timely manner so as to realize best\n\npossible benefit to bankruptcy estate and trustee's engagement in\n\nspeculative real estate venture in which trustee had no prior\n\nexperience and without consultation and aid of experienced real\n\nestate developer).     Since Muratore bases his complaint on the\n\ntrustee's alleged misconduct in liquidating and administering the\n\nestate's property, and not on tortious acts committed in the\n\nfurtherance of Muratore's leasing or mortgage and real estate\n\nbusiness, section 959(a) does not apply.\n\n           Muratore urges us to recognize as an additional or\n\nexpanded exception to the Barton doctrine the situation where the\n\ntrustee commits a tort of any sort.       For this proposition, he\n\nrelies chiefly on a single case, In the Matter of Campbell, 13 B.R.\n\nat 976.   There, the district judge, in detailing the history of the\n\ncase, included a portion of the state district court's holding with\n\n\n                                -12-\n\frespect to the plaintiff's state court action against the trustee,\n\nwhich stated, inter alia:\n\n          \"Apparently there are two situations in which\n          a trustee . . . may be sued in State Court\n          without leave of the federal bankruptcy court,\n          one being where the trustee has committed a\n          tort, and the other where the claim of\n          wrongful doing arises out of the trustee's\n          operating of the debtor's business.\"\n\nId. (citing Lawrence P. King, 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, § 23.20 at\n\n642-45 (14th ed.))6.    This language appears to be the only example\n\nof a court having articulated so broad a tort exception to the\n\nBarton doctrine.7      On the other side of the ledger, there are\n\nnumerous cases in which the Barton doctrine was held to bar tort\n\nactions brought without permission of the bankruptcy court.    See,\n\ne.g., Carter, 220 F.3d at 1253 (applying Barton doctrine and\n\n\n     6\n      We find no mention of a tort exception to the Barton doctrine\nin the most recent, fifteenth edition of Collier on Bankruptcy.\nCf. Lawrence P. King, 6 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 721.05 (\"As a\ngeneral rule, however, leave of the appointing court must be\nobtained to institute an action in a non-appointing forum for acts\ndone in the trustee's official capacity and within the trustee's\nauthority as an officer of the court.

In In the Matter of\nMercy-Douglass Hospital, Inc., 364 F. Supp. 1066, 1068 (E.D. Pa.\n1973), the district court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nopined that litigants can bring \"suits against the Trustee\npersonally for wrongs committed while performing the duties of his\noffice\" (emphasis supplied) without the permission of the\nbankruptcy court.\n\n                                 -13-\n\fstating, \"There also is no merit to Carter's assertion that his\n\ntort claims -- breach of fiduciary duty and reasonable care -- are\n\n'unrelated to' and 'outside the scope' of the bankruptcy proceeding\n\nbecause they do not arise directly from substantive provisions of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code.\"); In re Lehal Realty Assocs., 101 F.3d at\n\n275-77 (breach of fiduciary duty); In re Linton, 136 F.3d 544, 544-\n\n46 (7th Cir. 1998) (malicious prosecution); Richman v. Batt, 265\n\nB.R. 416, 417-19 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (\"Plaintiff's allegations faintly\n\nsound in breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.\"); Taraska v. Carmel,\n\n223 B.R. 200, 202-3 (D. Ariz. 1998) (defamation); Bay Area Material\n\nHandling, Inc. v. Broach (In re Bay Area Material Handling, Inc.),\n\nNo. C 95-01903CW, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21958, at *9-*14 (N.D.

In the present context, we can find no basis for\n\nrecognizing some generalized tort exception to the Barton doctrine.\n\n            In addition, Muratore argues that the Barton doctrine\n\ndoes not apply here because the bankruptcy case is closed and the\n\nestate assets are no longer \"in the receiver's hands\" as they were\n\nin Barton.    Muratore is wrong.          To be sure, one purpose of the\n\nBarton   doctrine    is   to   prevent    a    party    from   obtaining   \"some\n\nadvantage    over   the   other   claimants      upon    the   assets\"   in   the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\ftrustee's hands, and that purpose would not necessarily be served\n\nhere.    But the doctrine serves additional purposes even after the\n\nbankruptcy case has been closed and the assets are no longer in the\n\ntrustee's hands.    See Barton, 104 U.S. at 128.    In In re Linton,\n\nthe Seventh Circuit held that the Barton doctrine applied to a\n\nstate court lawsuit filed eleven months after the bankruptcy case\n\nwas closed.    136 F.3d at 544-45.      Writing for the court, Judge\n\nPosner stated:\n\n            [w]ithout   the  requirement    [of   obtaining\n            leave], trusteeship will become a more irksome\n            duty, and so it will be harder for courts to\n            find competent people to appoint as trustees.\n            Trustees will have to pay higher malpractice\n            premiums,    and    this    will    make    the\n            administration of the bankruptcy laws more\n            expensive (and the expense of bankruptcy is\n            already a source of considerable concern).\n            Furthermore, requiring that leave to sue be\n            sought enables bankruptcy judges to monitor\n            the work of the trustees more effectively. It\n            does this by compelling suits growing out of\n            that work to be as it were prefiled before the\n            bankruptcy judge that made the appointment;\n            this helps the judge decide whether to approve\n            this trustee in a subsequent case.\n\nId.; see also In re Krikava, 217 B.R. 275, 278-79 (Bankr. D. Neb.\n\n1998) (applying Barton doctrine to closed bankruptcy case).8\n\n\n     8\n      Muratore's reliance upon In re Mailman Steam Carpet Cleaning\nCorp., 196 F.3d at 4, for the proposition that applying the Barton\ndoctrine to closed bankruptcy cases is an improper expansion of its\npurpose is misplaced. There, we merely held that, even though it\nallows a certain category of suits to proceed without prior leave\nfrom the appointing court, section 959(a) does not negatively imply\nthat leave is required in all other cases. Id. We did not hold\nthat the scope of the Barton doctrine should be restricted as\nMuratore suggests.\n\n                                 -15-\n\f          In the alternative, Muratore requests that if this Court\n\nconcludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, it should\n\nnevertheless refer this case to the bankruptcy court rather than\n\ndismiss it.   This court, however, does not have this option.   Rule\n\n12(h)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that a\n\ncourt \"shall dismiss\" an action over which it lacks subject-matter\n\njurisdiction.   See also Mills v. State of Maine, 118 F.3d 37, 51\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).    If there is any basis for circumventing Rule\n\n12(h)(3), Muratore does not point it out.\n\n          We AFFIRM the district court's dismissal of the case.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

Plaintiff-appellant, Joseph R. Muratore, Sr. owned and controlled Columbus Mortgage Company, Inc. (Referred to herein as the \"debtor\"). On February 15, 1991, the debtor filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On December 23, 1991, the bankruptcy court granted the U.S. Trustee's application to employ defendant-appellee, Stephen Darr, as trustee. On July 18, 1996, the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the Plan of Reorganization. Approximately four years later, the bankruptcy court entered orders granting Darr's application for final decree and approving his application for final compensation. Muratore filed objections to these applications, which the bankruptcy court considered and denied. Muratore did not appeal. The bankruptcy court closed the case on November 9, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 2002, Muratore brought the instant lawsuit against Darr, in Darr's capacity as trustee, in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 2002, apparently without relation to Muratore's present action, the bankruptcy court reopened the bankruptcy proceedings, and they were still open on October 18, 2002 when Muratore amended his complaint herein.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count I of his amended complaint, Muratore alleged that Darr \"did not faithfully perform the duties of his office and committed acts of misfeasance [and/or] malfeasance in the performance of his duties in that ...\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. he did not pay taxes and, as a result, lost six properties at tax sale;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. he defectively sold at a foreclosure rental properties, generating three additional law suits;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. he defectively sold at a foreclosure income properties, generating three additional law suits;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. he failed to file corporate returns, resulting in forfeiture of charter and causing real estate to revert to stockholders;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. he failed to file tax returns to the Rhode Island Tax Administrator, resulting in the denial of issuance of letters of good standing, causing defective titles and defeating transfer of titles; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. purchases of some properties were procured with funds from the Gambino family in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count II, Muratore alleged that Darr committed abuse of process by committing waste so egregious that his advisors and/or employees used Chapter 11 protection procedures to put Muratore out of business rather than to assist in reorganizing Muratore's business. He further alleged that \"such use of his [Darr's] powers constitutes use of judicial appointment and proceedings in bankruptcy for an ulterior purpose, to wit, to make it impossible for Muratore to conduct business and to earn a living from his business.\" In Count III, Muratore alleged that Darr was negligent because he breached his duty to protect the assets of the trust and to serve the trust with diligence. In Count IV, Muratore alleged that the purchase of certain trust property was financed either directly or indirectly by funds obtained from the illegal interests and enterprises of a notorious crime family in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Muratore neither obtained leave of the bankruptcy court nor sought bankruptcy court authority before commencing this lawsuit in the district court. Citing Muratore's failure to obtain such authority, Darr moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The district court allowed the motion. Muratore appeals from the dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review `the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, taking the allegations in the complaint as true and making all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff.'\" <i>Doran v.

The central issue here is whether the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because of Muratore's failure to have obtained leave from the bankruptcy court to bring this action in the former court. In determining whether a complaint alleges sufficient facts to establish jurisdiction, we read the complaint holistically. <i>LeBlanc v. Salem (In re Mailman Steam Carpet Cleaning Corp.),</i> 196 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Barton v.

The Supreme Court ruled that before suit is brought against a receiver, leave of the court by which the trustee was appointed must be obtained. The Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, in cases of bankruptcy, many incidental questions arise in the course of administering the bankrupt estate, which would ordinarily be pure cases at law, and in respect of their facts triable by jury, but, as belonging to the bankruptcy proceedings, they become cases over which the bankruptcy court, which acts as a court of equity, exercises exclusive control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 134; <i>see also Katchen v.

Weitzman (In re DeLorean Motor Co.),</i> 991 F.2d 1236, 1240-41 (6th Cir.1993) (describing 959(a) exception as \"limited\").

In considering this argument, we must ascertain whether Muratore's claims apply to the trustee's \"acts or transactions in carrying on business connected with\" the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little First Circuit case law on this issue, but courts elsewhere have interpreted \"acts or transactions in carrying on business connected with\" the bankruptcy estate to mean acts or transactions in conducting the debtor's business in the ordinary sense of the words or in pursuing that business as an operating enterprise. <i>See, e.g., Melvin v. Klein,</i> 49 Misc.2d 24, 266 N.Y.S.2d 533, 536-37 (N.Y. Spec. Term 1965). In interpreting section 959(a)'s predecessor, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 125,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Learned Hand, writing for the Second Circuit, concluded that \"[m]erely to hold matters in statu quo; to mark time, as it were; to do only what is necessary to hold the assets intact; such activities\" did not constitute carrying on business. <i>Vass v. Conron Bros. Co.,</i> 59 F.2d 969, 971 (2d Cir.1932). Rather, section 959(a) \"is intended to `permit actions redressing torts committed in furtherance of the debtor's business, such as the common situation of a negligence claim in a slip and fall case where a bankruptcy trustee, for example, conducted a retail store.'\" <i>Carter,</i> 220 F.3d at 1254 (quoting <i>Lebovits v. Scheffel (In re Lehal Realty Assocs.</i>), 101 F.3d 272, 276 (2d Cir.1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, section 959(a) applied where a trustee continued the business of a debtor in operating a railroad, and the trustee had been sued in his representative capacity for damages for use of another's tracks, <i>Thompson v. Texas Mexican Ry. Co.,</i> 328 U.S. 134, 138, 66 S.Ct. 937, 90 L.Ed. 1132 (1946) (applying predecessor to section 959(a)), and in a case for wrongful death and injury resulting to a member of the public in a grade crossing accident, <i>Valdes v. Feliciano,</i> 267 F.2d 91, 94-95 (1st Cir.1959). Also, the exception has been held to apply to an employee's claims arising from injuries caused by overwork at a railroad company operated by the trustee and the trustee's withholding of an employee's pension. <i>Haberern v. Lehigh and New England Ry., Co.,</i> 554 F.2d 581, 585 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, courts have concluded that merely holding and collecting the assets intact, <i>Vass,</i> 59 F.2d at 971, collecting and liquidating the assets of the debtor, <i>Austrian v. Williams,</i> 216 F.2d 278, 285 (2d Cir.1954), and taking steps for the care and preservation of the property, <i>U. &amp; I., Inc. v.

Co.,</i> 165 F. 895, 896-97 (2d Cir.1908), do not constitute \"carrying on business.\" Likewise, actions taken in the mere continuous administration of property under order of the court do not constitute an \"act\" or \"transaction\" in carrying on business connected with the estate. <i>Field v. Kansas City Refining Co.,</i> 9 F.2d 213, 216 (8th Cir.1925); <i>see also In re DeLorean Motor Co.,</i> 991 F.2d at 1241 (action against trustee and representatives alleging abuse of process and malicious prosecution in relation to prosecution of fraudulent conveyance action is a suit for actions of trustee wholly unrelated to carrying on debtor's business because trustee merely collected, took steps to preserve, and/or held assets, as well as performed other aspects of administering and liquidating estate); <i>Carter,</i> 220 F.3d at 1254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that section 959(a) does not apply here. In his brief, Muratore represents that he was in the business of \"leasing to commercial and residential tenants, and all required acts associated with maintaining such leases.\" His complaint, however, does not specify the nature of the businesses at issue. Darr contends that Muratore's business was actually \"the making of mortgage loans.\" We need not, however, resolve this question. The allegations in the complaint focus upon Darr's actions in the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of his fiduciary responsibilities as trustee, as opposed to acts or transactions in the furtherance of Muratore's business whatever it was. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 959(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The accounting for and sale of property, the filing of tax returns, and the payment of taxes were among Darr's statutory responsibilities and powers as a Chapter 11 trustee. 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 363 &amp; 1106;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>see also Holywell Corp. v.

Indeed, Muratore does not appear to dispute that Darr had these responsibilities; rather, he argues that Darr did not adequately respond to them &#8212; specifically, that Darr did not liquidate the properties quickly enough, improperly liquidated the properties, and did not pay taxes or file tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The different counts in Muratore's complaint all allege Darr's misconduct in discharging his trustee's administrative responsibilities. Count I alleges that Darr did not \"faithfully perform the duties of his office\" when he performed improper liquidations, failed to file tax returns and pay taxes, and allowed the purchase of property with illegal funds. Counts II, III, and IV merely reiterate these allegations within claims for \"abuse of process,\" \"negligence,\" and violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1961-1968 respectively.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> These allegations are very similar to ones made in other cases holding the 959(a) exception did not apply. <i>Carter,</i> 220 F.3d at 1254 (holding section 959(a) exception did not apply to claims arising from Chapter 7 trustee's allegedly improper liquidation of estate assets at auction)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>; <i>In re DeLorean</i> <i>Motor Co.,</i> 991 F.2d at 1240-41 (holding section 959(a) did not apply to action against Chapter 7 trustee and representatives alleging abuse of process and malicious prosecution in relation to prosecution of fraudulent conveyance action); <i>Austrian,</i> 216 F.2d at 285 (holding in Chapter 11 case that section 959(a) did not apply and stating, \"[m]erely to attempt to collect and liquidate the assets of a debtor is not to carry on its business in any proper sense of the term.\") (citations omitted); <i>Kashani v. Fulton (In re Kashani),</i> 190 B.R. 875, 884-85 (9th Cir.BAP1995) (holding section 959(a) did not apply to breach of fiduciary duty and negligence claims arising from, inter alia, Chapter 11 trustee's failure to sell or attempt to sell estate property in timely manner so as to realize best possible benefit to bankruptcy estate and trustee's engagement in speculative real estate venture in which trustee had no prior experience and without consultation and aid of experienced real estate developer). Since Muratore bases his complaint on the trustee's alleged misconduct in liquidating and administering the estate's property, and not on tortious acts committed in the furtherance of Muratore's leasing or mortgage and real estate business, section 959(a) does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Muratore urges us to recognize as an additional or expanded exception to the Barton doctrine the situation where the trustee commits a tort of any sort. For this proposition, he relies chiefly on a single case, <i>In the Matter of Campbell,</i> 13 B.R. at 976. There, the district judge, in detailing the history of the case, included a portion of the state district court's holding with respect to the plaintiff's state court action against the trustee, which stated, <i>inter alia:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Apparently there are two situations in which a trustee ... may be sued in State Court without leave of the federal bankruptcy court, one being where the trustee has committed a tort, and the other where the claim of wrongful doing arises out of the trustee's operating of the debtor's business.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (citing Lawrence P. King, 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, &#167; 23.20 at 642-45 (14th ed.))<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>. This language appears to be the only example of a court having articulated so broad a tort exception to the Barton doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> On the other side of the ledger, there are numerous cases in which the Barton doctrine was held to bar tort actions brought without permission of the bankruptcy court. <i>See, e.g., Carter,</i> 220 F.3d at 1253 (applying Barton doctrine and stating, \"There also is no merit to Carter's assertion that his tort claims &#8212; breach of fiduciary duty and reasonable care &#8212; are `unrelated to' and `outside the scope' of the bankruptcy proceeding because they do not arise directly from substantive provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\"); <i>In re Lehal Realty Assocs.,</i> 101 F.3d at 275-77 (breach of fiduciary duty); <i>In re Linton,</i> 136 F.3d 544, 544-46 (7th Cir.1998) (malicious prosecution); <i>Richman v.

Dec. 6, 1995) (\"damages for economic and emotional harm relating to Defendants' alleged failure to pursue discovery properly,\" \"mismanagement of Bay Area's real estate,\" and \"the trustee's noncollection of certain debts owed to the debtor by an outside third party\"). In the present context, we can find no basis for recognizing some generalized tort exception to the Barton doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Muratore argues that the Barton doctrine does not apply here because the bankruptcy case is closed and the estate assets are no longer \"in the receiver's hands\" as they were in <i>Barton.</i> Muratore is wrong. To be sure, one purpose of the Barton doctrine is to prevent a party from obtaining \"some advantage over the other claimants upon the assets\" in the trustee's hands, and that purpose would not necessarily be served here. But the doctrine serves additional purposes even after the bankruptcy case has been closed and the assets are no longer in the trustee's hands. <i>See Barton,</i> 104 U.S. at 128. In <i>In re Linton,</i> the Seventh Circuit held that the Barton doctrine applied to a state court lawsuit filed eleven months after the bankruptcy case was closed. 136 F.3d at 544-45. Writing for the court, Judge Posner stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]ithout the requirement [of obtaining leave], trusteeship will become a more irksome duty, and so it will be harder for courts to find competent people to appoint as trustees. Trustees will have to pay higher malpractice premiums, and this will make the administration of the bankruptcy laws more expensive (and the expense of bankruptcy is already a source of considerable concern). Furthermore, requiring that leave to sue be sought enables bankruptcy judges to monitor the work of the trustees more effectively. It does this by compelling suits growing out of that work to be as it were prefiled before the bankruptcy judge that made the appointment; this helps the judge decide whether to approve this trustee in a subsequent case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.; see also In re Krikava,</i> 217 B.R. 275, 278-79 (Bankr.D.Neb.1998) (applying Barton doctrine to closed bankruptcy case).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Muratore requests that if this Court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, it should nevertheless refer this case to the bankruptcy court rather than dismiss it. This court, however, does not have this option. Rule 12(h)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that a court \"shall dismiss\" an action over which it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. <i>See also Mills v. State of Maine,</i> 118 F.3d 37, 51 (1st Cir. 1997).

Plaintiff-appellant, Joseph R. Muratore, Sr. owned and controlled Columbus Mortgage Company, Inc. (Referred to herein as the \"debtor\"). On February 15, 1991, the debtor filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On December 23, 1991, the bankruptcy court granted the U.S. Trustee's application to employ defendant-appellee, Stephen Darr, as trustee. On July 18, 1996, the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the Plan of Reorganization. Approximately four years later, the bankruptcy court entered orders granting Darr's application for final decree and approving his application for final compensation. Muratore filed objections to these applications, which the bankruptcy court considered and denied. Muratore did not appeal.

He further alleged that \"such use of his [Darr's] powers constitutes use of judicial appointment and proceedings in bankruptcy for an ulterior purpose, to wit, to make it impossible for Muratore to conduct business and to earn a living from his business.\" In Count III, Muratore alleged that Darr was negligent because he breached his duty to protect the assets of the trust and to serve the trust with diligence.

Indeed, Muratore does not appear to dispute that Darr had these responsibilities; rather, he argues that Darr did not adequately respond to them &#8212; specifically, that Darr did not liquidate the properties quickly enough, improperly liquidated the properties, and did not pay taxes or file tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The different counts in Muratore's complaint all allege Darr's misconduct in discharging his trustee's administrative responsibilities.

Since Muratore bases his complaint on the trustee's alleged misconduct in liquidating and administering the estate's property, and not on tortious acts committed in the furtherance of Muratore's leasing or mortgage and real estate business, section 959(a) does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Muratore urges us to recognize as an additional or expanded exception to the Barton doctrine the situation where the trustee commits a tort of any sort. For this proposition, he relies chiefly on a single case, <i>In the Matter of Campbell,</i> 13 B.R. at 976. There, the district judge, in detailing the history of the case, included a portion of the state district court's holding with respect to the plaintiff's state court action against the trustee, which stated, <i>inter alia:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Apparently there are two situations in which a trustee ... may be sued in State Court without leave of the federal bankruptcy court, one being where the trustee has committed a tort, and the other where the claim of wrongful doing arises out of the trustee's operating of the debtor's business.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (citing Lawrence P.

This language appears to be the only example of a court having articulated so broad a tort exception to the Barton doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> On the other side of the ledger, there are numerous cases in which the Barton doctrine was held to bar tort actions brought without permission of the bankruptcy court. <i>See, e.g., Carter,</i> 220 F.3d at 1253 (applying Barton doctrine and stating, \"There also is no merit to Carter's assertion that his tort claims &#8212; breach of fiduciary duty and reasonable care &#8212; are `unrelated to' and `outside the scope' of the bankruptcy proceeding because they do not arise directly from substantive provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\"); <i>In re Lehal Realty Assocs.,</i> 101 F.3d at 275-77 (breach of fiduciary duty); <i>In re Linton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751652\"><a href=\"/opinion/751652/in-the-matter-of-betty-a-linton-also-known-as-betty-a-lasiter-debtor/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 544-46 (7th Cir.1998) (malicious prosecution); <i>Richman v.

To be sure, one purpose of the Barton doctrine is to prevent a party from obtaining \"some advantage over the other claimants upon the assets\" in the trustee's hands, and that purpose would not necessarily be served here. But the doctrine serves additional purposes even after the bankruptcy case has been closed and the assets are no longer in the trustee's hands. <i>See Barton,</i> 104 U.S. at 128. In <i>In re Linton,</i> the Seventh Circuit held that the Barton doctrine applied to a state court lawsuit filed eleven months after the bankruptcy case was closed. 136 F.3d at 544-45. Writing for the court, Judge Posner stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]ithout the requirement [of obtaining leave], trusteeship will become a more irksome duty, and so it will be harder for courts to find competent people to appoint as trustees. Trustees will have to pay higher malpractice premiums, and this will make the administration of the bankruptcy laws more expensive (and the expense of bankruptcy is already a source of considerable concern). Furthermore, requiring that leave to sue be sought enables bankruptcy judges to monitor the work of the trustees more effectively. It does this by compelling suits growing out of that work to be as it were prefiled before the bankruptcy judge that made the appointment; this helps the judge decide whether to approve this trustee in a subsequent case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.; see also In re Krikava,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1884749\"><a href=\"/opinion/1884749/matter-of-krikava/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 278-79 (Bankr.D.Neb.1998) (applying Barton doctrine to closed bankruptcy case).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Muratore requests that if this Court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, it should nevertheless refer this case to the bankruptcy court rather than dismiss it.
