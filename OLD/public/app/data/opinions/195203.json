Howard,  Attorney  General,   and  Mark  D.  Attorri,\n                                                                 \nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.  Petitioner Herbert Fowler is appealing\n                    \n\nthe district court's  order denying his petition for  writ of\n\nhabeas  corpus.    After  reviewing   the  record  and  trial\n\ntranscripts,  we  have  concluded  that  the  district  court\n\ncorrectly determined that  there are no grounds  for granting\n\nFowler's request for relief, and so we affirm.  \n\n          Fowler first claims  that the trial court  erred by\n\npermitting the state  to pose on re-direct  certain questions\n\nto Sergeant  James Barthelmes,  the state  police officer  in\n\ncharge  of  the  crime scene.    The  state asked  Barthelmes\n\nwhether  defense  counsel  had  asked  him  to  make  certain\n\nmeasurements  or undertake certain  studies of evidence found\n\nat  the  murder scene.    Fowler alleges  that  the re-direct\n\nexamination violated his right to remain silent and suggested\n\nto  the jury  that he had  a duty  to produce evidence.   The\n\ntranscript  shows  that, during  the  cross-examination which\n\npreceded the state's re-direct, defense counsel had attempted\n\nto   show   that  Barthelmes   should  have   performed  such\n\nmeasurements  or  studies.    On  re-direct,  the  prosecutor\n\nresponded by  trying to  show that, if  such measurements  or\n\nstudies had been  significant, the  defense could have  asked\n\nthe police to undertake them itself.  \n\n          We have no doubt that  the jury was not confused as\n\nto who bore  the burden of proof in this murder trial.  After\n\nthe  court gave preliminary instructions  to the jury pool on\n\nthe  state's  burden of  proof,  each juror  was individually\n\nvoir-dired  as to  his or  her understanding of  the relevant\n\nlegal  standards.   Defense counsel essentially  queried each\n\njuror whether  he or  she understood that  the defendant  was\n\npresumed innocent, that the state  bore the burden of proving\n\nthe defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the\n\ndefense  had  no obligation  to  testify  or to  present  any\n\nevidence   on  his  own  behalf,  and  each  juror  responded\n\naffirmatively.    Moreover, during  his  cross-examination of\n\nBarthelmes,  which preceded  the  state's re-direct,  defense\n\ncounsel had responded to Sergeant Barthelmes's statement that\n\ndefense  counsel or  anyone  else  could  have  obtained  the\n\nmeasurements  from him by reminding Barthelmes (and hence the\n\njury) that \"Sergeant, I don't have to do anything.\"1  \n\n          Thus, the  prosecutor's attempt  to  show that  the\n\ndefense  had not sought the measurements or studies responded\n\nto defense counsel's own  suggestions that those measurements\n\nor studies should  have been made, and the  jury was unlikely\n\nto  have understood from  his questioning of  Barthelmes that\n\nthe  defense bore the  burden of proving  Fowler's innocence.\n\nThe prosecutor  confined his  questions on  re-direct to  the\n\nspecific  suggestions  for   investigation  made  by  defense\n\ncounsel  during  his  cross-examination,  made  no   explicit\n\n                    \n\n1.  We also  note that, in his closing, the defense commented\nthat the jury  was \"well aware\" of the  respective burdens of\nthe  parties,  and   reminded  the  jury  members   of  their\nstatements on  voir  dire  that  they would  not  expect  the\ndefense  to present  evidence  and  would  not  draw  adverse\ninferences  from Fowler's failure  to testify.   The relevant\nlegal standards were  also reiterated in the  court's closing\ninstructions.\n\n                             -3-\n\nreference  to defendant's  failure to  testify,  and did  not\n\notherwise say  or suggest that  the defense's failure  to ask\n\nthe  police  to  undertake  certain  measurements or  studies\n\nconstituted substantive  evidence of guilt.   Therefore,  the\n\nprosecutor's  re-direct  examination was  a  lawful and  fair\n\nresponse under  United States  v. Robinson,  485 U.S. 25,  32\n                                          \n\n(1988)  (the   prosecutor's  comment  had  not   treated  the\n\ndefendant's silence as substantive evidence of guilt, but had\n\nreferred  to defendant's opportunity  to testify at  trial in\n\ncountering  defense counsel's  own suggestion  that defendant\n\nhad not been given  an opportunity to tell his story,  and so\n\nwas  a \"fair  response\"  to  defendant's  claim and  did  not\n\nviolate the privilege against self-incrimination).\n\n          Fowler also claims that it was error for  the court\n\nnot to grant his counsel's request for a mistrial or curative\n\ninstructions with respect  to Sergeant Barthelmes's responses\n\non re-direct examination.   As we have said,  the state's re-\n\ndirect   examination   of   Barthelmes   was  not   improper.\n\nAccordingly, it was not error  for the trial court to decline\n\nto call a mistrial or to issue curative instructions.  \n\n          Finally, Fowler says that the re-direct examination\n\nof  Barthelmes, together with certain closing comments by the\n\nprosecution, shifted the burden of proof to him  and violated\n\nhis  right against self-incrimination.   The  first allegedly\n\nimproper closing  comment  came at  the  very outset  of  the\n\n                             -4-\n\nprosecutor's closing  argument when the prosecutor  asked the\n\njury  whether \"the  defense  [has]  presented  you  with  any\n\nreasonable alternative  to the  one conclusion  that all  the\n\nevidence in this case points  to?\"  Upon objection by defense\n\ncounsel,  the court  reminded  the jury  \"that the  burden of\n\nproof  is always  on  the State  in any  criminal case.   The\n\ndefendant does not  have to prove his innocence  or any other\n\nfact.\"  \n\n          The prosecutor's query  to the jury, in  isolation,\n\nappears  problematic, but context  is critical in determining\n\nwhether  statements  by  the  prosecution  have  violated   a\n\ndefendant's privilege against self-incrimination.  See United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 307 (1st  Cir. 1992).   Here,\n                \n\nthe transcript suggests that the prosecutor was responding to\n\nthe defense  counsel's closing  argument, which  had outlined\n\nseriatim  the  \"reasonable  doubts\" the  defense  saw  in the\n\nprosecution's  case against Fowler,  and which  had suggested\n\nalternative  scenarios, e.g.,  that a  third  party may  have\n\nmurdered  the victims during  a robbery attempt,  or that the\n\nshotgun shells had been planted at the murder scene after the\n\nmurders.  If  so, the comment  was arguably permissible  fair\n\nresponse.  We need not decide that question, however, because\n\nthe trial court promptly instructed the jury as to the burden\n\nof proof  after the  prosecutor's query to  the jury,  and so\n\ncured any constitutional impropriety in his question.  Lilly,\n                                                            \n\n                             -5-\n\nsupra,  983 F.2d at 308 (prompt curative instruction from the\n     \n\ncourt  may be a  \"satisfactory antidote\" to  an impermissible\n\ncomment by the prosecutor).\n\n          The second allegedly  improper closing statement by\n\nthe prosecutor  came when  the  prosecutor addressed  defense\n\ncounsel's  specific criticisms  of Roger  Klose,  the state's\n\nexpert witness who had linked the shotgun shells found at the\n\nmurder scene with  Fowler's shotgun.  The  prosecutor pointed\n\nto one of  the defense's arguments -- that  Klose should have\n\nbrought photographs showing that marks on the shells found at\n\nthe scene  matched marks on  shells fired from  Fowler's gun.\n\nAfter  explaining why photographs  would not have  helped the\n\njury,  the  prosecutor  said:   \"That's  the  extent  of  the\n\ndefense's  attack on  Roger Klose's  conclusions  and it's  a\n\npretty  sorry effort.  The defense has done nothing to try to\n\ncall into  question or to demonstrate  -- .\"  At  that point,\n\ndefense  counsel  objected,  but  the  court   permitted  the\n\nprosecutor to  continue.   The prosecutor  then finished  his\n\nthought, commenting that  \"[t]he defense has done  nothing to\n\nshow that Roger Klose's opinions are anything other than what\n\nthey purport to be; valid, accurate conclusions, drawn on the\n\nbasis  of training,  experience and  expertise.\"   Thus,  the\n\ncontext makes clear  that no constitutional impropriety  took\n\nplace.    The  prosecutor  was  arguing  that  the  defense's\n\ncriticism  of the state's  expert witness had  not undermined\n\n                             -6-\n\nthe  conclusions reached by the expert; he was not attempting\n\nto suggest that the defense  had failed in some obligation to\n\npresent evidence  of  Fowler's innocence.   Accordingly,  the\n\nprosecutor's comments were  a fair response to  the defense's\n\nspecific suggestion of weakness in the expert's testimony.\n\n          Because we  find no  merit in  Fowler's claims,  we\n\nneed  not  consider  the state's  alternative  argument  that\n\nFowler has brought his habeas claims too late.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                             -7-\n",

Moreover, during his cross-examination of Barthelmes, which preceded the state's re-direct, defense counsel had responded to Sergeant Barthelmes's statement that defense counsel or anyone else could have obtained the measurements from him by reminding Barthelmes (and hence the jury) that \"Sergeant, I don't have to do anything.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the prosecutor's attempt to show that the defense had not sought the measurements or studies responded to defense counsel's own suggestions that those measurements or studies should have been made, and the jury was unlikely to have understood from his questioning of Barthelmes that the defense bore the burden of proving Fowler's innocence.  The prosecutor confined his questions on re-direct to the specific suggestions for investigation made by defense counsel during his cross-examination, made no explicit reference to defendant's failure to testify, and did not otherwise say or suggest that the defense's failure to ask the police to undertake certain measurements or studies constituted substantive evidence of guilt.  Therefore, the prosecutor's re-direct examination was a lawful and fair response under  United States v. Robinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112010\"><a href=\"/opinion/112010/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 32 (1988) (the prosecutor's comment had not treated the defendant's silence as substantive evidence of guilt, but had referred to defendant's opportunity to testify at trial in countering defense counsel's own suggestion that defendant had not been given an opportunity to tell his story, and so was a \"fair response\" to defendant's claim and did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fowler also claims that it was error for the court not to grant his counsel's request for a mistrial or curative instructions with respect to Sergeant Barthelmes's responses on re-direct examination.  As we have said, the state's re-direct examination of Barthelmes was not improper.  Accordingly, it was not error for the trial court to decline to call a mistrial or to issue curative instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Fowler says that the re-direct examination of Barthelmes, together with certain closing comments by the prosecution, shifted the burden of proof to him and violated his right against self-incrimination.  The first allegedly improper closing comment came at the very outset of the prosecutor's closing argument when the prosecutor asked the jury whether \"the defense [has] presented you with any reasonable alternative to the one conclusion that all the evidence in this case points to?\"  Upon objection by defense counsel, the court reminded the jury \"that the burden of proof is always on the State in any criminal case.  The defendant does not have to prove his innocence or any other fact.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's query to the jury, in isolation, appears problematic, but context is critical in determining whether statements by the prosecution have violated a defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.   See United States v. Lilly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597801\"><a href=\"/opinion/597801/united-states-v-william-w-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 307 (1st Cir. 1992).  Here, the transcript suggests that the prosecutor was responding to the defense counsel's closing argument, which had outlined seriatim the \"reasonable doubts\" the defense saw in the prosecution's case against Fowler, and which had suggested alternative scenarios, e.g., that a third party may have murdered the victims during a robbery attempt, or that the shotgun shells had been planted at the murder scene after the murders.  If so, the comment was arguably permissible fair response.  We need not decide that question, however, because the trial court promptly instructed the jury as to the burden of proof after the prosecutor's query to the jury, and so cured any constitutional impropriety in his question.  Lilly, supra, 983 F.2d at 308 (prompt curative instruction from the court may be a \"satisfactory antidote\" to an impermissible comment by the prosecutor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second allegedly improper closing statement by the prosecutor came when the prosecutor addressed defense counsel's specific criticisms of Roger Klose, the state's expert witness who had linked the shotgun shells found at the murder scene with Fowler's shotgun.  The prosecutor pointed to one of the defense's arguments-that Klose should have brought photographs showing that marks on the shells found at the scene matched marks on shells fired from Fowler's gun.  After explaining why photographs would not have helped the jury, the prosecutor said:  \"That's the extent of the defense's attack on Roger Klose's conclusions and it's a pretty sorry effort.  The defense has done nothing to try to call into question or to demonstrate-.\"  At that point, defense counsel objected, but the court permitted the prosecutor to continue.  The prosecutor then finished his thought, commenting that \"[t]he defense has done nothing to show that Roger Klose's opinions are anything other than what they purport to be;  valid, accurate conclusions, drawn on the basis of training, experience and expertise.\"  Thus, the context makes clear that no constitutional impropriety took place.  The prosecutor was arguing that the defense's criticism of the state's expert witness had not undermined the conclusions reached by the expert;  he was not attempting to suggest that the defense had failed in some obligation to present evidence of Fowler's innocence.  Accordingly, the prosecutor's comments were a fair response to the defense's specific suggestion of weakness in the expert's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find no merit in Fowler's claims, we need not consider the state's alternative argument that Fowler has brought his habeas claims too late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We also note that, in his closing, the defense commented that the jury was \"well aware\" of the respective burdens of the parties, and reminded the jury members of their statements on voir dire that they would not expect the defense to present evidence and would not draw adverse inferences from Fowler's failure to testify.  The relevant legal standards were also reiterated in the court's closing instructions</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
