D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                    Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     U. Charles Remmel, II, with whom Jennifer A. Archer and Kelly,\nRemmel & Zimmerman were on brief, for appellant/cross-appellee.\n     Eric J. Uhl, with whom Moon, Moss, McGill & Shapiro, P.A. was\non brief, for appellee/cross-appellant.\n\n\n\n                           April 16, 2004\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge. These are cross-appeals in a Title\n\nVII religious discrimination case.               A jury found Spencer Press of\n\nMaine liable for the harassment of its employee Albert Johnson on\n\naccount of his religion and awarded compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages, respectively $400,000 and $750,000, the sum of which was\n\nreduced   to     the    statutory      cap      of   $300,000.        42   U.S.C.     §\n\n1981a(b)(3)(D); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, § 4613(2)(B)(8)(e)(iv).\n\nJohnson was repeatedly harassed over the course of his nine-year\n\nemployment      in   Spencer      Press's       janitorial     department    by     his\n\nsupervisor, Steven Halasz.\n\n           Spencer Press appeals from the denial of its new trial\n\nmotion, arguing that the evidence did not show that the harassment\n\nwas because of Johnson's religion and did not show that it was\n\nsevere and pervasive.            Spencer Press also challenges the punitive\n\ndamages   award      and    the    jury   instructions.          We   reject      these\n\ncontentions and affirm.\n\n             Johnson cross-appeals the district court's holding that\n\nhe was not entitled to any back pay or front pay after he was fired\n\nfrom his next job, after leaving Spencer Press, for misconduct. He\n\nalso   argues    that      the    district   court     erred    in    rejecting     the\n\ncontention that he was unable to get a subsequent job because he\n\nwas psychologically disabled, and that Spencer Press is responsible\n\nfor this disability because it stems from the harassment he endured\n\nwhile he was an employee there.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f           We affirm the limitation on Johnson's front pay and back\n\npay, but we do so on alternative grounds.       We hold that it is error\n\nto cut off, as a matter of law, the ability of a successful Title\n\nVII plaintiff to receive further back pay or front pay once he is\n\nfired for misconduct from the position he takes after leaving the\n\ndiscriminatory employer.     As a result, we reach a second issue on\n\nwhich Johnson's cross-appeal ultimately fails; Johnson was unable\n\nto work because he was totally disabled and the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to support Johnson's claim that this disability was\n\nattributable to the harassment he endured at Spencer Press.              We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           On April 3, 2002, plaintiff Albert Johnson filed suit\n\nagainst   his   former   employer,    Spencer   Press   of   Maine,   Inc.,1\n\nalleging that he had been discriminated against and harassed on the\n\nbasis of, inter alia,2 his religion in violation of Title VII of\n\n\n     1\n      Johnson also sued Spencer Press, Inc., the parent corporation\nof Spencer Press of Maine, Inc. The district court granted summary\njudgment to Spencer Press, Inc., and Johnson has not appealed that\ndecision. All references in this opinion to Spencer Press refer to\nSpencer Press of Maine.\n     2\n      Johnson also alleged that he had been the victim of unlawful\ndiscrimination on the basis of a disability and that he had been\nunlawfully retaliated against for invoking his rights.          The\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to Spencer Press on the\ndisability discrimination claim, and Johnson does not appeal that\ndetermination. The district court did not grant summary judgment\nto Spencer Press on the retaliation claim, but, based on the jury's\nverdict, judgment was entered against Johnson on this claim and\nJohnson also does not appeal this determination.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et\n\nseq., and the Maine Human Rights Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5,\n\n§ 4551 et seq. (West 2002).3    The complaint sought all available\n\nforms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages and\n\nfront and back pay.      Spencer Press promptly moved for summary\n\njudgment on these claims. The district court denied the motions as\n\nto Johnson's underlying discrimination and harassment claims and as\n\nto the availability of punitive damages, but held, as a matter of\n\nlaw, that Johnson was not entitled to any front pay or back pay for\n\nany time after December 8, 2000.   Johnson was fired for misconduct\n\non that date from Hannaford Brothers, his employer immediately\n\nafter he left Spencer Press.\n\n          The case proceeded to trial before a jury on April 28,\n\n2003 and lasted four days. The testimony presented at trial, which\n\nis recounted in the light most favorable to Johnson, O'Rourke v.\n\nCity of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 717 (1st Cir. 2001), established\n\nthe following account.\n\n          Johnson received a B.S. in Bible Studies from Valley\n\nForge Christian College in 1978 and served as a pastor at the Beech\n\nRidge Assembly of God Church from May 1979 to October 1981.     In\n\n1981, Johnson resigned from his position at the church and found a\n\nnew job at the Paul Dever State School for the mentally retarded,\n\n\n\n     3\n      The parties have not argued that there are          material\ndifferences between Title VII and the Maine statute.\n\n                                -4-\n\fwhich he stayed in until July 1990.       Despite leaving his official\n\nposition at the church, Johnson remained very active in religious\n\nactivities.\n\n           In November of 1991, Johnson began working as a custodian\n\nat Spencer Press, a printing company.         After Johnson started at\n\nSpencer Press, he expressed to both his supervisor at the time and\n\nhis co-workers a desire to have Sundays off from work.             Although\n\nJohnson had to work most Sundays, his first few months at Spencer\n\nPress were incident-free.\n\n           Stephen Halasz became the supervisor of the custodial\n\ndepartment at Spencer Press in May of 1992.              Some time shortly\n\nthereafter, Johnson expressed to Halasz a desire to have Sundays\n\noff, if possible. Johnson had also had discussions with co-workers\n\nin which he revealed his religious beliefs.          Starting either in\n\nlate 1992 or early 1993, Halasz began asking Johnson about his\n\nreligious views.    Halasz testified that he understood the reason\n\nthat Johnson did not like to work on Sundays was because he wanted\n\nto go to church.     Halasz also testified that he was aware that\n\nJohnson was religious before he found out in 1995 that Johnson used\n\nto be a minister.\n\n           Soon   after   Halasz   was   promoted   to    the   position   of\n\nsupervisor, he started making inappropriate and lewd comments to\n\nJohnson.   Johnson recounted one incident in late 1992 in which\n\nHalasz told him to \"help hold my dick\" and another incident in\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fwhich Halasz said Johnson looked tired and told a co-worker that\n\n\"if Al fucks like he works, then he must be slow as a nigger.\"\n\nHalasz made multiple other inappropriate and sexually explicit\n\ncomments to Johnson throughout 1992 and 1993.\n\n          At least two of these remarks specifically targeted\n\nJohnson's religious beliefs.   At one point, Halasz tried to show\n\nJohnson a Playboy magazine and said that he \"must be Catholic\"\n\nbecause he got flustered whenever Halasz made comments about sex.\n\nJohnson said that on another occasion in 1992, Halasz proclaimed to\n\nanother custodian that \"Al doesn't fuck, drink or smoke, he must be\n\na Catholic.\"   Halasz admitted to making derogatory remarks to\n\nJohnson and teasing him for being Catholic.     He also said that he\n\nremembered calling Johnson a Catholic when he refused to look at a\n\nPlayboy magazine.\n\n          Upset by Halasz's treatment of him, Johnson started in\n\n1994 to keep notes of \"significant\" events that he considered\n\n\"hostile or demeaning.\"   Johnson kept notes of numerous instances\n\nof harassment by Halasz that occurred from 1992 until May 2000,\n\nwhen Johnson left Spencer Press.   These included Halasz's comments\n\nthat Johnson should suck Halasz's dick, that Halasz hoped a deer\n\nwould \"run[] out of the woods and suck[] [his] cock,\" and that\n\nJohnson should give his boss a \"blow job.\"      Halasz did not make\n\ncomments like these to any of the other custodians at Spencer\n\nPress.   One of Johnson's former co-workers, Patrick Hubbard,\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fconfirmed that Halasz consistently and frequently called Johnson\n\nnames such as \"fucking queer,\" \"fucking cock sucker,\" and \"fucking\n\nlazy.\" Hubbard testified that he never heard Halasz call any other\n\nworkers by these names.\n\n          A significant percentage of the derogatory comments that\n\nHalasz made from 1994 to 2000 involved Johnson's religion.   Halasz\n\ncalled Johnson a \"religious freak\" and told Johnson that he was\n\ntired of his \"religious bullshit.\"    According to Johnson, Halasz\n\ntold him that because of his religious beliefs he \"wasn't out\n\nbasically getting pussy.\"   On April 27, 2000, a day before Johnson\n\ntendered his resignation to Spencer Press, Halasz told Johnson that\n\n\"he was getting real tired of hearing that [Johnson] couldn't work\n\novertime on Sundays, that [he] was involved in church and classes,\n\nand [that Halasz] didn't like it.\"    Halasz then asked Johnson \"if\n\nyou could work overtime . . . and make $120 or love Jesus, what\n\nwould you do?\"   When Johnson answered that he would love Jesus,\n\nHalasz screamed \"well, why don't you take Mary and turn her upside\n\ndown and pull her dress over her head.\"\n\n          Halasz's derogatory remarks involving religion were also\n\ncorroborated by the testimony of Johnson's former co-worker. Karen\n\nHart, who worked with Johnson as a custodian in 1999, testified\n\nthat Halasz harassed Johnson about his religion and called him a\n\n\"religious freak.\"   Hart recalled Halasz telling Johnson that \"I\n\ndon't want to hear about your religious bullshit\" and, on another\n\n\n                                -7-\n\foccasion, that he should \"go work with people that are Jehovah\n\nWitnesses and keep your comments to yourself [because] I don't want\n\nto hear about the religious stuff.\"           Halasz also told Johnson that\n\nJohnson's job was more important than his church affairs.                    Halasz\n\nmade these comments, according to Hart, \"on a daily basis\" while\n\nshe was working at Spencer Press.            Hart testified that she was so\n\ndistraught     by   these   comments    that    she    told    Halasz    that   he\n\n\"shouldn't be harassing [Johnson] about his religion.\"\n\n              Johnson's testimony that Halasz consistently harassed him\n\nabout   his    religious    beliefs    was    also    corroborated      by    Norma\n\nCrawford, a friend of Johnson.           Crawford testified that Johnson\n\nfrequently called her from work when he was upset and told her that\n\nhe was being harassed at work because of his religion.                 On several\n\nof these occasions, according to Crawford, Johnson was crying when\n\nhe called her.       Crawford testified that Johnson told her about\n\nHalasz's comment regarding the Virgin Mary.\n\n              Johnson also testified about several instances in which\n\nHalasz threatened to kill him with a hand grenade, run him over\n\nwith a car, and shoot him with a bow and arrow.                  At one point,\n\nHalasz took a knife out of its sheath and put the point of it under\n\nJohnson's chin.\n\n              Johnson complained to the human resources department\n\nabout   the    treatment    he   was   receiving      from    Halasz    about   six\n\ndifferent times over the course of his employment.                Each time, he\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fwas told that there was nothing that could be done and, that if he\n\ndid not like the treatment he was receiving, he could leave the\n\ncompany.   At one point, the human resources person to whom Johnson\n\ncomplained told him that she could not pursue his complaints about\n\nHalasz because if she did she would be fired.               Johnson also filed\n\nseveral requests to transfer into another division within Spencer\n\nPress, each of which was denied.\n\n           On April 28, 2000, Halasz resigned his position from\n\nSpencer Press.      He had been experiencing frequent panic attacks at\n\nwork, and at one point he had needed to be taken to the hospital in\n\nan ambulance as a result of a panic attack.            He also had suffered\n\nfrom severe depression.          On May 2, he began another job at\n\nHannaford Brothers, a supermarket chain.\n\n           Johnson subsequently filed a complaint with the Maine\n\nHuman   Rights    Commission    and    the   Equal   Employment    Opportunity\n\nCommission.      After Johnson filed these complaints, Halasz came to\n\nJohnson's house and threatened to beat him up if he maintained his\n\ncomplaints.       He   also   told    Johnson   that   as   a   result   of   the\n\ncomplaints, he had been forced to take harassment classes at\n\nSpencer Press and that he had learned that he had discriminated\n\nagainst Johnson on the basis of his religion.\n\n           On May 1, 2003, a jury returned a verdict in which it\n\nconcluded that Spencer Press harassed Johnson because of his\n\nreligion or religious beliefs and that Johnson was constructively\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fdischarged from Spencer Press because of that harassment. The jury\n\nalso found that Spencer Press had not independently taken any\n\nspecific adverse employment action against Johnson on the basis of\n\nhis religion.    The jury awarded Johnson $400,000 in compensatory\n\ndamages and $750,000 in punitive damages.     Spencer Press did not\n\nfile a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\n            Spencer Press did move for a new trial pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. Proc. 59, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury's verdict.    That motion was denied, and judgment\n\nwas entered in favor of Johnson on the harassment claim.    Pursuant\n\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3)(D), the sum of compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages was capped at $300,000. Johnson was also awarded $1,227.94\n\nin back pay, which represented Johnson's wage loss between May 2,\n\n2000 and December 8, 2000, the period he was employed at Hannaford\n\nBrothers.\n\n            Spencer Press appeals both the district court's denial of\n\nits motion for a new trial and the underlying judgment.      Johnson\n\ncross-appeals the district court's ruling limiting the availability\n\nof front and back pay.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f                          II. Direct Appeal\n\nA.   Denial of Spencer Press's Motion for a New Trial\n\n            We review the district court's denial of Spencer Press's\n\nmotion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.4      Marrero v.\n\nGoya of P.R., Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 2002).     In doing so,\n\nwe recognize that motions for a new trial are generally \"directed\n\nto the trial court's discretion and th[e] remedy is sparingly\n\nused.\" Dall v. Coffin, 970 F.2d 964, 969 (1st Cir. 1992) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).   A district court should only grant such\n\nmotions if \"the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence\n\nsuch that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of\n\njustice.\"   Ramos v. Davis & Geck, Inc., 167 F.3d 727, 731 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The jury found in favor of Johnson on his workplace\n\nharassment claim based on religion.      Spencer Press argues that\n\nthere was no causal link to religion and that the harassment was\n\nnot severe and pervasive.    To prevail on a harassment claim based\n\n\n\n     4\n      Spencer Press argues in its opening brief that it is also\nappealing the district court's refusal to grant judgment as a\nmatter of law, and that this holding should be reviewed de novo.\nBut after the jury reached its verdict, Spencer Press filed only a\nmotion for a new trial under Rule 59, and not for a judgment as a\nmatter of law under Rule 50(b). Accordingly, Spencer Press has\nwaived its earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law and is\nnot entitled to appellate review on the issue.      See Cambridge\nPlating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 759 (1st Cir. 1996);\nPinkham v. Burgess, 933 F.2d 1066, 1070 (1st Cir. 1991). Even so,\nwe observe that an objectively reasonable jury could easily have\nreached the result here.\n\n                                -11-\n\fon a supervisor's conduct, Johnson needed to carry his burden that:\n\n(1) he was a member of a protected class; (2) he was subject to\n\nuninvited harassment; (3) the offending conduct was because of his\n\nreligion; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive\n\nto affect the terms and conditions of employment; (5) the offending\n\nconduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive; and (6)\n\nthere was a basis for employer liability.   Rivera v. P.R. Aqueduct\n\n& Sewers Auth., 331 F.3d 183, 189 (1st Cir. 2003); O'Rourke, 235\n\nF.3d at 728.   Spencer Press argues that the jury's conclusion in\n\nfavor of Johnson was against the clear weight of the evidence on\n\nboth prongs (3) and (4).\n\n          In advancing the claim that any harassment was not due to\n\nreligion, Spencer Press relies heavily on Rivera, in which we noted\n\na \"conceptual gap between an environment that is offensive to a\n\nperson of strong religious sensibilities and an environment that is\n\noffensive because of hostility to the religion guiding those\n\nsensibilities.\"   331 F.3d at 190.5   Although Spencer Press admits\n\nthat there may have been several isolated incidents in which the\n\nharassment manifested itself in comments implicating religion, it\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Rivera upheld an award of summary judgment to the employer on\nde novo review. 331 F.3d at 185. Had Spencer Press moved for\njudgment as a matter of law under Rule 50, the same standard of\nreview would apply. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc.,\n530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000). Here, by contrast, the denial of Spencer\nPress's motion for a new trial under Rule 59 must meet the more\ndifficult standard of abuse of discretion. See supra.\n\n                               -12-\n\fargues that this was not sufficient for the jury to conclude that\n\nJohnson was harassed because of his religion.\n\n            The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndeclining to grant a new trial.                 Soon after Halasz was promoted to\n\ncustodial supervisor, he became aware that Johnson was a religious\n\nperson.      At    approximately          the    same   time,    he    started     making\n\nextremely inappropriate and lewd comments to Johnson.                       At first,\n\nonly some of these remarks explicitly targeted Johnson's religion:\n\nHalasz repeatedly said that Johnson \"must be Catholic\" because he\n\ndid   not   want   to    do    certain      things.      Gradually,       though,    the\n\nharassment came to focus unabashedly on Johnson's religious views.\n\nHalasz repeatedly called Johnson a \"religious freak,\" told him not\n\nto talk about \"religious bullshit,\" said that because of his\n\nreligion he was not getting sex, and told him to \"take [the Virgin]\n\nMary and turn her upside down and pull her dress over her head.\"\n\n            Almost      all   of    the    inappropriate        comments    concerning\n\nJohnson's religion focused on a consistent theme: that Johnson was\n\ntoo chaste and sober for Halasz's taste and that this was because\n\nof Johnson's religious beliefs.                   Halasz did not make similarly\n\ninappropriate      and     offensive       comments     to   other      Spencer     Press\n\nemployees.         Given      the   consistency         of   the      harassment     that\n\nspecifically invoked Johnson's religion and the more frequent\n\nharassment that did not, the jury could easily have concluded that\n\nthe underlying motivation -- religious discrimination -- was the\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fsame for each.       The jury also could have easily concluded that this\n\nmotivation    stemmed     from   Halasz's    animosity   towards   Johnson's\n\nreligious beliefs; indeed, Halasz explicitly attributed Johnson's\n\nchastity and sobriety to his religious convictions.           As explained\n\nin Rivera, \"conduct need not be explicitly religious to constitute\n\nharassment because of religion.\"         331 F.3d at 190 n.2; see Venters\n\nv. City of Delphi, 123 F.3d 956, 973 (7th Cir. 1997) (religious\n\nharassment can be established through indirect comments that are\n\nnot on their face about religion); cf. Landrau-Romero v. Banco\n\nPopular de Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 614 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Alleged\n\nconduct that is not explicitly racial in nature may, in appropriate\n\ncircumstances, be considered along with more overtly discriminatory\n\nconduct in assessing a Title VII harassment claim.\").\n\n             For similar reasons, we reject Spencer Press's argument\n\nthat it was against the clear weight of the evidence for the jury\n\nto find that the harassment endured by Johnson was sufficiently\n\n\"severe or pervasive\" to affect a \"term, condition, or privilege of\n\nemployment.\"     Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67\n\n(1986).   Whether the harassment was severe or pervasive \"must be\n\nanswered by reference to 'all the circumstances,' including the\n\n'frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it\n\nis physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive\n\nutterance;     and     whether   it   unreasonably   interferes    with   an\n\nemployee's work performance.'\"          Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico,\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fInc., 304 F.3d 7, 18 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Harris v. Forklift\n\nSys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993)).            \"Subject to some policing at\n\nthe outer bounds, it is for the jury to weigh those factors and\n\ndecide whether the harassment was of a kind or to a degree that a\n\nreasonable person would have felt that it affected the conditions\n\nof her employment.\"         Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The description of facts set forth earlier provides more\n\nthan ample support for the jury's conclusion.              Halasz repeatedly\n\nand    continuously       insulted    Johnson   and   mocked   his   religious\n\nconvictions.      The harassment occurred throughout Johnson's work\n\nday, including when he was attempting to perform his custodial\n\nduties.    On multiple occasions, Halasz threatened Johnson with\n\nviolence and once he actually placed the point of a knife under\n\nJohnson's chin.       In sum, there was more than ample evidence to\n\nsupport the jury's conclusion that the harassment was severe and\n\npervasive.      See White v. N.H. Dep't of Corr., 221 F.3d 254, 260-61\n\n(1st    Cir.     2000)     (finding     that    \"disgusting    comments\"      and\n\nconversations that occurred \"everyday\" could support a finding that\n\nharassment was severe and pervasive).\n\nB. Spencer Press's Challenge to the Punitive Damages Award\n\n            Spencer       Press   argues   that   the   jury   did   not   have\n\nsufficient evidence to award punitive damages because Halasz was\n\nnot    acting   \"in   a    managerial    capacity\"    during   the   course    of\n\nJohnson's employment.         Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526,\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f545-46 (1999). Spencer Press admits that the jury rationally could\n\nhave rejected its affirmative defense to an award of punitive\n\ndamages that it had exercised reasonable care to avoid harassment\n\nand to eliminate it when it might occur.            Id. at 545.\n\n           The availability of punitive damages is not a live issue.\n\nThe jury awarded Johnson $400,000 in compensatory damages and\n\n$750,000 in punitive damages.            Acting pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1981a(b)(3)(D)       and   Me.    Rev.      Stat.     Ann.   tit.     5,    §\n\n4613(2)(B)(8)(e)(iv), both of which cap the sum of punitive and\n\ncompensatory damages for employers with over 500 employees, the\n\ndistrict court entered judgment for Johnson for $300,000.6           Because\n\nthe   compensatory    damages    award    was   itself   greater    than   the\n\nstatutory cap, the award would have been the same regardless of\n\nwhether the jury awarded any punitive damages.            See Quint v. A.E.\n\nStaley Mfg. Co., 172 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 1999) (declining to\n\naddress whether a compensatory damages award was excessive because\n\nthe award of punitive damages exceeded the statutory cap); Hogan v.\n\nBangor & Aroostook R.R. Co., 61 F.3d 1034, 1037 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(avoiding the issue of punitive damages because the jury's award of\n\ncompensatory damages was the same as the statutory cap).\n\nC.    Spencer Press's Challenge to the Jury Instructions on the\n      Severe or Pervasive Requirement\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      This amount did not include the district court's additional\naward to Johnson of $1,227.94 in back pay.\n\n                                   -16-\n\f           Spencer Press argues that the district court erred in its\n\nexplanation to the jury of the requirement that the harassment be\n\n\"severe or pervasive.\"     Spencer Press preserved the objection.\n\n           The district court instructed the jury that, to succeed\n\non his harassment claim, Johnson must show:\n\n        that the harassment was sufficiently severe or\n        pervasive so as to alter the conditions of his\n        employment    and  create   an    abusive   working\n        environment. . . .\n           Religiously discriminatory remarks, innuendos,\n        ridicule, and intimidation can be sufficiently\n        severe or pervasive in their accumulated effect to\n        alter the conditions of employment and create an\n        abusive working environment. But offhand comments,\n        rudeness, occasional teasing and isolated incidents\n        are not alone sufficient. This is not a general\n        civility code for the workplace.\n\nSpencer Press's argument is that this instruction was flawed\n\nbecause it did not include a statement that the conduct must be\n\n\"extreme.\"    This argument is premised on the Supreme Court's\n\nstatement in Faragher that \"conduct must be extreme to amount to a\n\nchange in the terms and conditions of employment.\"           524 U.S. at 788\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n           We review the district court's choice of language in\n\ninstructing the jury for an abuse of discretion.            Gray v. Genlyte\n\nGroup, Inc., 289 F.3d 128, 133 (1st Cir. 2002).           The district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in omitting the word \"extreme\" from\n\nits   instructions   to   the   jury.     It   is   the   district   court's\n\nprerogative to craft the \"particular verbiage\" that it will use in\n\nits jury instructions.     Febres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp., 214\n\n                                   -17-\n\fF.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 2000).              So long as that language properly\n\nexplains   the       controlling    legal       standards      and      is   not      unduly\n\nconfusing or misleading, it will not be second-guessed on appeal.\n\nSee id.; Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d 337, 353 (1st\n\nCir. 1989); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n\n807 (1993)      (one    definition       of    \"extreme\"      is      \"marked    by    great\n\nseverity\").         There is no requirement that the word \"extreme\" be\n\nused in instructing the jury on a harassment claim.\n\n           III. Johnson's Cross-Appeal Regarding Damages\n\n           Johnson          cross-appeals      the     district        court's      summary\n\njudgment and post-trial determinations that, as a matter of law, he\n\nis not entitled to any back pay or front pay for any period beyond\n\nDecember   8,       2000.      Spencer    Press      raises      no    questions       about\n\nJohnson's preservation of these issues for appeal.\n\n           The       availability    of       back   pay   and     front     pay      is    not\n\naffected by the cap on compensatory and punitive damages.                                  Both\n\nfederal and Maine law clearly exclude awards of back pay from the\n\nstatutory cap on the sum of compensatory and punitive damages. See\n\n42   U.S.C.     §    1981a(b)(2);        Me.    Rev.    Stat.         Ann.   tit.      5,    §\n\n4613(2)(B)(8)(d).           And the Supreme Court has recently clarified\n\nthat the same rule applies to awards of front pay.                      Pollard v. E.I.\n\ndu Pont de Nemours & Co., 532 U.S. 843, 848 (2001).\n\n           An award of back pay compensates plaintiffs for lost\n\nwages and benefits between the time of the discharge and the trial\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fcourt   judgment.          See     Lindemann     &      Grossman,     Employment\n\nDiscrimination Law 635-37 (Cane, Jr. et al. eds., 3d ed. 1996).\n\nFront pay, by contrast, is \"money awarded for lost compensation\n\nduring the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of\n\nreinstatement.\"      Pollard,      532    U.S.   at    846;   see   Lindemann   &\n\nGrossman, at 639-42.       Front pay thus compensates plaintiffs for\n\nlost wages that may accrue after the conclusion of the trial.\n\nBoth back pay and front pay are authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n5(g)(1), which provides:\n\n     If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally\n     engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful\n     employment practice charged in the complaint, the court\n     may . . . order such affirmative action as may be\n     appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to,\n     reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without\n     back pay (payable by the employer, employment agency, or\n     labor organization, as the case may be, responsible for\n     the unlawful employment practice), or any other equitable\n     relief as the court deems appropriate. Back pay liability\n     shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to\n     the filing of a charge with the Commission. Interim\n     earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by\n     the person or persons discriminated against shall operate\n     to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable.\n\n          During     the    back    pay     period,     individuals      have   an\n\nobligation   to     exercise       \"reasonable        diligence\"    in    finding\n\nalternative suitable employment.            See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(1);\n\nFord Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U.S. 219, 231-32 (1982) (an \"unemployed\n\nor underemployed claimant, like all other Title VII claimants, is\n\nsubject to the statutory duty to minimize damages set out in\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(1)); Carey v. Mt. Desert Island Hosp., 156 F.3d\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f31, 41 (1st Cir. 1998).       Thus, awards of back pay are offset by any\n\nwages that could have been earned with reasonable diligence after\n\nthe illegal discharge, regardless of whether they were actually\n\nearned.    See § 2000e-5(g)(1); Quinones Candelario v. Postmaster\n\nGen. of United States, 906 F.2d 798, 799-802 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nFailures to mitigate damages can take a variety of forms, including\n\nnot looking for new employment, see, e.g., Hansard v. Pepsi-Cola\n\nMetro. Bottling Co., 865 F.2d 1461, 1468 (5th Cir. 1989), finding\n\nnew employment but voluntarily quitting, see, e.g., EEOC v. Delight\n\nWholesale Co., 973 F.2d 664, 670 (8th Cir. 1992), or, as in this\n\ncase, finding new employment and getting discharged for misconduct,\n\nsee, e.g., Brady v. Thurston Motor Lines, Inc., 753 F.2d 1269, 1277\n\n(4th Cir. 1985).\n\n           The Supreme Court laid out the basic standards for\n\nawarding back pay in Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405\n\n(1975).     That    opinion    clarified    that    in   cases    of   unlawful\n\ndiscrimination, \"back pay should be denied only for reasons which,\n\nif applied generally, would not frustrate the central statutory\n\npurposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and\n\nmaking    persons    whole     for   injuries      suffered      through    past\n\ndiscrimination.\"     Id. at 421.     Despite its equitable nature, back\n\npay is therefore \"a presumptive entitlement of a plaintiff who\n\nsuccessfully   prosecutes       an   employment     discrimination         case.\"\n\nThurman v. Yellow Freight Systs., Inc., 90 F.3d 1160, 1171 (6th\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fCir. 1996).   In this circuit, juries are generally entrusted with\n\ndecisions on back pay when the jurors are already resolving issues\n\nof liability and compensatory damages.7          See Santiago-Negron v.\n\nCastro-Davila, 865 F.2d 431, 441 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n           Awards of front pay, by contrast, are generally entrusted\n\nto the district judge's discretion8 and are available in a more\n\nlimited set of circumstances than back pay. See Lussier v. Runyon,\n\n50 F.3d 1103, 1108-09 (1st Cir. 1995).          Front pay should not be\n\nawarded   unless   reinstatement    is    impracticable   or   impossible.\n\nWildman v. Lerner Stores Corp., 771 F.2d 605, 616 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\nEven then, awards of front pay are discretionary, in part because\n\nthey necessarily involve predictions of events yet to come.            See\n\nid.; Lussier, 50 F.3d at 1109.      For these reasons, district court\n\ndecisions as to front pay are generally afforded more deference\n\nthan decisions as to back pay.\n\n           The district court ruled that Johnson stopped mitigating\n\nhis damages about seven months after he left Spencer Press, when he\n\nwas fired on December 8, 2000 from his subsequent job at Hannaford\n\nBrothers, a major supermarket chain in Maine.       Johnson had started\n\n\n\n     7\n      However, \"[w]here only reinstatement and back pay are\nrequested or if they are the only issues, in addition to liability,\nremaining in the case then both reinstatement and back pay shall be\nfor the court.\" Santiago-Negron, 865 F.2d at 441.\n     8\n      There is some dispute, which need not concern us, as to\nwhether a jury should make calculations, if disputed, for purposes\nof the award. See Lindemann & Grossman, at 640-41.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fthat job only a few days after leaving Spencer Press.              Johnson was\n\nfound eating food for which he had not paid, in violation of\n\nHannaford company rules.       This failure to mitigate damages, held\n\nthe district court, eliminated the availability of either back pay\n\nor front pay for any time period after December 8.9              Moreover, the\n\ndistrict court found that there was insufficient evidence that the\n\nmistreatment    Johnson     endured    at    Spencer   Press     was    causally\n\nresponsible    for   his   being   fired     from   Hannaford.         The    court\n\nconcluded that Johnson's own lay testimony to this effect did not\n\ncreate an issue of fact and that Johnson's expert was not \"specific\n\nenough\"   on   the   link    between     Johnson's     disability       and     his\n\nmisbehavior at Hannaford.10\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      The district court's initial ruling on this issue was that\n\"the value of the Hannaford wages and benefits, whatever it is, can\nbe treated as an ongoing offset to Johnson's loss resulting from\nleaving [Spencer Press].\" This holding would have entitled Johnson\nto receive the differential between his wages at Hannaford and\nSpencer Press not only for the period he was employed at Hannaford\nfrom May 2 to December 8, 2000 (the $1,227.94), but also for the\nperiod after December 8, 2000. After trial, the district court\naltered its decision, holding that back pay was only available \"for\nthe time during which the plaintiff was employed at Hannaford\nBros.\"\n     10\n      The district court, in light of its ruling on the\navailability of front pay, granted Spencer Press's motion in limine\nto exclude an expert witness who would present a statistical model\npredicting Johnson's lost front pay.        Because we ultimately\nconclude that Johnson was not entitled to front or back pay beyond\nDecember 8, 2000, we affirm the district court's refusal to\nconsider the expert testimony offered to prove the economic\nconsequences of Johnson's termination from Hannaford.\n\n                                      -22-\n\f            Johnson's cross-appeal does not dispute the conclusion\n\nthat Spencer Press was not responsible for his termination from\n\nHannaford.      Instead, Johnson's basic argument is that the district\n\ncourt misunderstood the implications of his being fired from\n\nHannaford for the availability of both front and back pay. Johnson\n\nargues    that    his    termination     from        Hannaford      only    tolled    the\n\navailability of back pay until he was able to find another job, and\n\nthat the district court erroneously held that the availability of\n\nback pay was permanently cut off at that point.                      Johnson makes a\n\nsimilar argument as to front pay, claiming that the district court\n\nstill had discretion to award front pay even after he was fired\n\nfrom Hannaford.         Furthermore, Johnson says that he was unable to\n\nfind a job after he was fired from Hannaford because he was\n\npsychologically         completely      disabled        and       Spencer     Press    is\n\nresponsible for this disability.                As a result, Johnson argues,\n\nSpencer Press is liable for back pay after he was fired from\n\nHannaford because it was responsible for his inability to end the\n\ntolling period.         Similarly, Johnson says that the district court\n\ncould    also    have    awarded    front      pay    on   this     rationale.        The\n\nanalytical issues as to back pay and front pay are similar.\n\nA.   Back pay\n\n            Review of the legal principles used by the district court\n\nin determining the availability of back pay is de novo.                        Reich v.\n\nCambridgeport      Air   Sys.,     26   F.3d    1187,      1190    (1st     Cir.   1994).\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fJohnson's appeal raises a number of difficult issues.         As Johnson\n\nnotes, the district court's final holding was that once Johnson was\n\nfired from Hannaford, he was no longer eligible for any back pay.11\n\n            The district court was correct that once Johnson was\n\nfired from Hannaford for misconduct, he was no longer mitigating\n\nhis damages, as was required.         But that did not mean that the\n\npossibility of back pay was permanently cut off.            Although the\n\ndistrict court did not explicitly endorse, or even give reasons\n\nfor,    such   a   rule,   its   holding   necessarily   relied   on   this\n\nsupposition of law.12      We hold that this was error.\n\n            In fact, at least two circuit courts have found that back\n\npay awards can accrue for periods after an employee is terminated\n\n\n       11\n      If this conclusion was incorrect -- as we think it was --\nthen a series of issues normally would arise about how to calculate\nback pay once an employee is fired from interim employment while\nattempting    to   mitigate   damages   stemming    from   unlawful\ndiscrimination.    One such issue is whether back pay should be\nwithheld for the period during which the employee is trying to find\nanother job, or should remain at the level it was at prior to the\nfiring.    Although we note this question below, we leave it\nunresolved because of an intervening dispositive fact: Johnson was\nunable to find employment after being fired from Hannaford because\nhe was totally disabled and he did not produce sufficient evidence\nthat Spencer Press caused that disability.\n       12\n      The district court's failure to address Johnson's argument\nthat Spencer Press was responsible for his total disability is\nattributable to the court's belief that the issue was irrelevant\nbecause Johnson's termination from Hannaford was dispositive of the\nissue. After all, Johnson filed a motion for reconsideration that\nspecifically claimed that the district court had neglected Spencer\nPress's responsibility for his ultimate disability, and the\ndistrict court denied it without comment. In the end, however, the\nreason for the district court's error is not relevant to the\nanalysis; all that is pertinent is that the error was made.\n\n                                    -24-\n\ffrom an \"employer B\" when the job at \"employer B\" was serving to\n\nmitigate damages arising from discriminatory conduct by \"employer\n\nA.\"     See Delight Wholesale, 973 F.2d at 670 (back pay period was\n\ntemporarily tolled after plaintiff voluntarily quit for personal\n\nreasons and began to run once she found a new job); Brady, 753 F.2d\n\nat 1278-80 (back pay is temporarily tolled after an employee is\n\nfired for misconduct in the course of mitigating damages from a\n\nprevious illegal discharge and begins again once the employee finds\n\nanother job).         These holdings stem, at least in part, from the\n\nNLRB's rule on the issue, first articulated in Knickerbocker\n\nPlastic Co., 132 N.L.R.B. 1209, 1215 (1961):\n\n      We further find that, as a result of such quitting, each\n      of these claimants shall be deemed to have earned for the\n      remainder of the period for which each is awarded back\n      pay the hourly wage being earned at the time such\n      quitting occurred. Therefore, an offset computed on the\n      appropriate rate per hour will be deducted as interim\n      earnings from the gross back pay of each of these\n      claimants. This offset shall be made applicable from the\n      date of the unjustified quitting throughout the remainder\n      of the back pay period for each particular claimant.\n\n(emphasis added).         Because Title VII's back pay language was\n\n\"'expressly modeled' on the analogous remedial provision of the\n\nNational Labor Relations Act (NLRA)\" the \"principles developed\n\nunder   the    NLRA    generally   guide,   but   do   not   bind,   courts   in\n\ntailoring remedies under Title VII.\"          Ford Motor Co., 458 U.S. at\n\n226 n.8 (internal citations omitted).\n\n              We hold that back pay is not permanently terminated when\n\nan employee is fired for misconduct or voluntarily quits interim\n\n                                     -25-\n\femployment.13   This view comports with the purpose of the back pay\n\nremedy as articulated in Albermarle.   Albermarle taught that back\n\npay is a presumptive entitlement of a victim of discrimination and\n\nthat the discriminating employer is responsible for all wage losses\n\nthat result from its unlawful discrimination, at least until the\n\ntime of judgment.14     422 U.S. at 419-21.     Had there been no\n\ndiscrimination at employer A, the employee would never have come to\n\nwork (or have been fired) from employer B.15    The discriminating\n\n\n     13\n      We do not suggest that a jury is required to extend the\nperiod of back pay under the circumstances, but only that there is\nno rule of law precluding it from doing so.\n     14\n      This issue is different from the issue of cutting off back\nand front pay when there is after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing\nthat would have resulted in the employee's discharge from employer\nA. In such cases, the Supreme Court has held that both front and\nback pay are indeed cut off at the time that the defendant\ndiscovers evidence that would have led it to fire the plaintiff on\nlegitimate grounds. McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ'g Co., 513\nU.S. 352, 361-62 (1995).     That result follows from the simple\nguiding principle that the employee should be restored to the\nposition he or she would have been in absent the discrimination:\nthe employee would have been fired regardless of the discrimination\nas a result of the misconduct at the defendant's place of\nemployment. See id. at 362.\n     15\n      There is a sub-issue about whether back pay, offset by deemed\nwages from employer B, should continue while the employee\ndiligently searches for post-employer-B employment.     The view of\nthe Fourth and Fifth Circuits is that back pay should equal zero\nduring \"periods of unemployment following justified discharge\"\nbecause \"[d]uring such a period the claimant has excluded himself\nfrom the employment market.\"      Brady, 753 F.2d at 1280; see\nPatterson v. P.H.P. Healthcare Corp., 90 F.3d 927, 935 (5th Cir.\n1996). Notably, though, this perspective is in opposition to the\nNLRB's rule in Knickerbocker, which would leave a back pay award\nunchanged after an employee had been fired from a job at which she\nwas mitigating damages from a prior unlawful termination.       See\nKnickerbocker, 132 N.L.R.B. at 1215. It also appears to be at odds\n\n                                -26-\n\femployer (employer A) should not benefit from the windfall of not\n\npaying the salary differential when the employee is re-employed by\n\nemployer C.16   Further, the use of per se rules is contrary to the\n\ngeneral principle that the necessary balancing of the equities\n\nrequires    a    case-by-case   approach.      Rosario-Torres   v.\n\nHernandez-Colon, 889 F.2d 314, 321 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc)\n\n(\"[T]he hallmark of equity is the ability to assess all relevant\n\nfacts and circumstances and tailor appropriate relief on a case by\n\ncase basis.\"); Medlock v. Ortho Biotech, Inc., 164 F.3d 545, 555\n\n(10th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 813 (1999).\n\n           Ultimately, we need not craft general principles for how\n\nback pay should be calculated when an employee who has been\n\ndiscriminated against is fired from intervening employment.     But\n\nour holding does require us to reach a second issue.    Here, once\n\nJohnson was fired from Hannaford, he never sought out employment\n\n\n\nwith the rule in the Eighth Circuit. See NLRB v. Hopcroft Art &\nStained Glass Works, Inc., 692 F.2d 63, 65 (8th Cir. 1982) (\"[T]he\namount the employee would have earned had he not quit is to be\noffset for the remainder of the back pay period.\"). Leaving the\nback pay award unchanged after the employee is fired from interim\nemployment, the logic goes, would put the employee in the position\nthat he would have been in had he exercised reasonable diligence in\nnever being fired.\n     16\n      Yet another sub-issue that we note involves how to calculate\nthe back pay award while the plaintiff is employed at employer C.\nThis is particularly difficult when the salary at employer B was\nhigher than the salary at employer C. The Brady court held that\nthe greater of the two salaries should be used for calculating back\npay while the employee is at employer C. See Brady, 753 F.2d at\n1278-80. We do not reach this issue.\n\n                                -27-\n\fbefore trial in a further attempt to mitigate damages.                          Johnson\n\nexplains that he did not seek further employment because he was\n\nunable    to    work     as   he    suffered        from   a   total    psychological\n\ndisability; indeed, Johnson received a 100 percent non-service\n\nconnected disability rating from the Veteran's Administration.\n\nSome courts have adopted a rule that if a plaintiff is unable to\n\nmitigate       damages    due      to    a     disability      not    caused    by    the\n\ndiscriminatory         employer,        that   disability      cuts    off     back   pay\n\nliability.17     Lathem v. Dep't of Children & Youth Servs., 172 F.3d\n\n786, 794 (11th Cir. 1999) (\"[C]ourts exclude periods where a\n\nplaintiff is unavailable to work, such as periods of disability,\n\nfrom the back pay award.\"); Starceski v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp.,\n\n\n     17\n      Why this should be so is not self-evident. If the plaintiff\nwould have been entitled to some form of salary continuation or\nbenefits for disability had he remained employed at the\ndiscriminatory employer, it is not clear why he would not be\nentitled to the equivalent if he became disabled from working post-\nemployment and before trial. Indeed, at least one circuit has held\nthat back pay awards should not be cut off due to a post-\ntermination disability if the plaintiff would have been entitled to\nsome form of salary continuation or disability benefits had he not\nbeen unlawfully terminated. Thornley v. Penton Publ'g, Inc., 104\nF.3d 26, 31 (2d Cir. 1997). This reasoning is simply a logical\noutgrowth of the principle that back pay should put the plaintiff\nin the position he or she would have been in but for the unlawful\ndiscrimination. Cf. Gutzwiller v. Fenik, 860 F.2d 1317, 1333 (6th\nCir. 1988) (back pay \"should include the salary, including any\nraises, which plaintiff would have received but for the\ndiscrimination, as well as sick leave, vacation pay, pension\nbenefits and other fringe benefits she would have received but for\ndiscrimination\").\n     Johnson does not raise this issue here because he presents no\nevidence and makes no claim that he would have been entitled to\ndisability benefits at Spencer Press had he not been unlawfully\nterminated.\n\n                                             -28-\n\f54 F.3d 1089, 1101 (3rd Cir. 1995) (\"[A]s a general rule . . . an\n\nemployer who has discriminated need not reimburse the plaintiffs\n\nfor salary loss attributable to the plaintiffs and unrelated to the\n\nemployment discrimination.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nHere,    Johnson   does   not     argue    that    a   disability     arising\n\nindependently of the discriminatory employer does not cut off back\n\npay, so we do not rule on the issue.        Johnson does, however, argue\n\nthat there was evidence that his disability was caused by the\n\nharassment he endured at Spencer Press.           If it was, he says, then\n\nboth back pay and front pay should have been available even after\n\nhe was fired from Hannaford for misconduct.\n\n           Johnson is correct that several courts have held that an\n\nemployee who is unable to work due to a disability is not precluded\n\nfrom receiving back pay when the employer \"caused\" the disability.\n\nThis court has, applying Massachusetts law, endorsed that rule.\n\nSee Blockel v. J. C. Penney Co., 337 F.3d 17, 27-28 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   We now extend that holding to Title VII; an employee who\n\ncannot mitigate damages because of the unlawful actions of the\n\nemployer can still receive back pay.         See Lathem, 172 F.3d at 794\n\n(\"[A] Title VII claimant is entitled to an award of back pay where\n\nthe defendant's discriminatory conduct caused the disability.\");\n\nDurham Life Ins. Co. v. Evans, 166 F.3d 139, 157 (3d Cir. 1999)\n\n(\"Because [the employer's] conduct affirmatively impaired [the\n\nemployee's]   ability     to    mitigate   her    damages,   it     would   be\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\finequitable to reduce her back pay award in this case.\").                This\n\nrule is merely a logical corollary of the principle that the\n\nvictims of discrimination should be restored, \"so far as possible\n\n. . . to a position where they would have been were it not for the\n\nunlawful discrimination.\"       Albermarle, 422 U.S. at 421.        If the\n\nemployer's unlawful conduct caused the employee's inability to\n\nmitigate damages, then the employer should be liable for the\n\nresulting consequences.\n\n           Nonetheless, the evidence provided by Johnson does not\n\nallow him to take advantage of this rule.           That evidence does no\n\nmore than create an issue regarding whether the harassment at\n\nSpencer   Press   was   one   among    numerous    other   independent    and\n\nsignificant   contributing     factors       to   Johnson's   psychological\n\ndisability.   Besides his own testimony, the only evidence that\n\nJohnson offered was the testimony of one expert, Dr. Ananis.              Dr.\n\nAnanis stated in a deposition that Johnson\n\n     had been able to maintain a certain degree of functioning\n     and employment until the events which took place during\n     his employment at Spencer Press, including the harassment\n     he stated he received while he worked there. I am aware\n     that Mr. Johnson had other issues in his life, including\n     family deaths, divorce, and problems with his sons, and\n     I did not make a determination as to what event or\n     events, if any, caused his depression and panic and\n     anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, it is clear to me that\n     the events at Spencer Press relating to the harassment he\n     stated he received from his supervisor exacerbated his\n     depression and panic and anxiety disorders.\n\nAlthough this testimony may have created a genuine question of fact\n\nabout whether there was some relationship between the harassment at\n\n                                      -30-\n\fSpencer Press and Johnson's disability, it was not sufficient for\n\nJohnson to escape summary judgment on the issue.         Given that\n\nJohnson was able to find a new job at Hannaford immediately after\n\nleaving Spencer Press and then to keep the job for the next seven\n\nmonths and given that Johnson has had numerous other significant\n\nproblems in his life that may have been causally related to his\n\ndisability, the evidence was insufficient.\n\n          Johnson's own testimony does not bridge the gap. Johnson\n\nconfirmed that he had suffered from depression and anxiety since\n\n1993, and that he had family problems as well as the problems he\n\nsuffered at Spencer Press.   But he did not, and could not (owing to\n\nhis lack of expertise), testify that his inability to get a job\n\nafter Hannaford was caused by the harassment at Spencer Press.\n\nB.   Front Pay\n\n          For the same reasons that we affirm the denial of back\n\npay after December 8, 2000, we conclude that there was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the district court's refusal to grant front pay.\n\n                                IV.\n\n          The district court's judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                   Concurring opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                -31-\n\f               CYR, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.         Although I agree\n\nthat   the     grant   of   summary    judgment   must   be   upheld,     I   write\n\nseparately because the discussion in the majority opinion regarding\n\nwhether the district court improperly predicated its decision on\n\nthe    legal    principle    that     Johnson’s   termination       by   Hannaford\n\npermanently severed his entitlement to back pay is an academic\n\nexercise wholly unnecessary to the disposition of the appeal. Even\n\nif it were to be assumed that this principle constituted an\n\nimplicit rationale upon which the district court relied – which I\n\nseriously doubt – its adoption plainly did not constitute outcome-\n\ndeterminative error.         Rather, just as the Rule 56 proffer made by\n\nJohnson (viz., the Ananis deposition) was not sufficient to prove\n\nthat SPM caused the misconduct that led to his termination by\n\nHannaford, so too it logically could not constitute evidence that\n\nSPM caused       Johnson's    full    disability.    Thus,     as    Johnson   was\n\nrequired to bear the burden of proof on causation, SPM was entitled\n\nto summary judgment under either legal theory.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\f",

A jury found Spencer Press of Maine liable for the harassment of its employee Albert Johnson on account of his religion and awarded compensatory and punitive damages, respectively $400,000 and $750,000, the sum of which was reduced to the statutory cap of $300,000. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(b)(3)(D); Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4613(2)(B)(8)(e)(iv).

Spencer Press also challenges the punitive damages award and the jury instructions. We reject these contentions and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson cross-appeals the district court's holding that he was not entitled to any back pay or front pay after he was fired from his next job, after leaving Spencer Press, for misconduct. He also argues that the district court erred in rejecting the contention that he was unable to get a subsequent job because he was psychologically disabled, and that Spencer Press is responsible for this disability because it stems from the harassment he endured while he was an employee there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the limitation on Johnson's front pay and back pay, but we do so on alternative grounds.

As a result, we reach a second issue on which Johnson's cross-appeal ultimately fails; Johnson was unable to work because he was totally disabled and the evidence was insufficient to support Johnson's claim that this disability was attributable to the harassment he endured at Spencer Press. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 3, 2002, plaintiff Albert Johnson filed suit against his former employer, Spencer Press of Maine, Inc.,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> alleging that he had been discriminated against and harassed on the basis of, inter alia,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> his religion in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> and the Maine Human Rights Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4551 <i>et seq.</i> (West 2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The complaint sought all available forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages and front and back pay. Spencer Press promptly moved for summary judgment on these claims. The district court denied the motions as to Johnson's underlying discrimination and harassment claims and as to the availability of punitive damages, but held, as a matter of law, that Johnson was not entitled to any front pay or back pay for any time after December 8, 2000. Johnson was fired for misconduct on that date from Hannaford Brothers, his employer immediately after he left Spencer Press.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case proceeded to trial before a jury on April 28, 2003 and lasted four days. The testimony presented at trial, which is recounted in the light most favorable to Johnson, <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713, 717 (1st Cir.2001), established the following account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson received a B.S. in Bible Studies from Valley Forge Christian College in 1978 and served as a pastor at the Beech Ridge Assembly of God Church from May 1979 to October 1981. In 1981, Johnson resigned from his position at the church and found a new job at the Paul Dever State School for the mentally retarded, which he stayed in until July 1990. Despite leaving his official position at the church, Johnson remained very active in religious activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1991, Johnson began working as a custodian at Spencer Press, a printing company. After Johnson started at Spencer Press, he expressed to both his supervisor at the time and his co-workers a desire to have Sundays off from work. Although Johnson had to work most Sundays, his first few months at Spencer Press were incident-free.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stephen Halasz became the supervisor of the custodial department at Spencer Press in May of 1992. Some time shortly thereafter, Johnson expressed to Halasz a desire to have Sundays off, if possible. Johnson had also had discussions with co-workers in which he revealed his religious beliefs. Starting either in late 1992 or early 1993, Halasz began asking Johnson about his religious views. Halasz testified that he understood the reason that Johnson did not like to work on Sundays was because he wanted to go to church. Halasz also testified that he was aware that Johnson was religious before he found out in 1995 that Johnson used to be a minister.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after Halasz was promoted to the position of supervisor, he started making inappropriate and lewd comments to Johnson. Johnson recounted one incident in late 1992 in which Halasz told him to \"help hold my dick\" and another incident in which Halasz said Johnson looked tired and told a co-worker that \"if Al fucks like he works, then he must be slow as a nigger.\" Halasz made multiple other inappropriate and sexually explicit comments to Johnson throughout 1992 and 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least two of these remarks specifically targeted Johnson's religious beliefs. At one point, Halasz tried to show Johnson a Playboy magazine and said that he \"must be Catholic\" because he got flustered whenever Halasz made comments about sex. Johnson said that on another occasion in 1992, Halasz proclaimed to another custodian that \"Al doesn't fuck, drink or smoke, he must be a Catholic.\" Halasz admitted to making derogatory remarks to Johnson and teasing him for being Catholic. He also said that he remembered calling Johnson a Catholic when he refused to look at a Playboy magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upset by Halasz's treatment of him, Johnson started in 1994 to keep notes of \"significant\" events that he considered \"hostile or demeaning.\" Johnson kept notes of numerous instances of harassment by Halasz that occurred from 1992 until May 2000, when Johnson left Spencer Press. These included Halasz's comments that Johnson should suck Halasz's dick, that Halasz hoped a deer would \"run[] out of the woods and suck[][his] cock,\" and that Johnson should give his boss a \"blow job.\" Halasz did not make comments like these to any of the other custodians at Spencer Press. One of Johnson's former co-workers, Patrick Hubbard, confirmed that Halasz consistently and frequently called Johnson names such as \"fucking queer,\" \"fucking cock sucker,\" and \"fucking lazy.\" Hubbard testified that he never heard Halasz call any other workers by these names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A significant percentage of the derogatory comments that Halasz made from 1994 to 2000 involved Johnson's religion. Halasz called Johnson a \"religious freak\" and told Johnson that he was tired of his \"religious bullshit.\" According to Johnson, Halasz told him that because of his religious beliefs he \"wasn't out basically getting pussy.\" On April 27, 2000, a day before Johnson tendered his resignation to Spencer Press, Halasz told Johnson that \"he was getting real tired of hearing that [Johnson] couldn't work overtime on Sundays, that [he] was involved in church and classes, and [that Halasz] didn't like it.\" Halasz then asked Johnson \"if you could work overtime... and make $120 or love Jesus, what would you do?\" When Johnson answered that he would love Jesus, Halasz screamed \"well, why don't you take Mary and turn her upside down and pull her dress over her head.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Halasz's derogatory remarks involving religion were also corroborated by the testimony of Johnson's former co-worker. Karen Hart, who worked with Johnson as a custodian in 1999, testified that Halasz harassed Johnson about his religion and called him a \"religious freak.\" Hart recalled Halasz telling Johnson that \"I don't want to hear about your religious bullshit\" and, on another occasion, that he should \"go work with people that are Jehovah Witnesses and keep your comments to yourself [because] I don't want to hear about the religious stuff.\" Halasz also told Johnson that Johnson's job was more important than his church affairs. Halasz made these comments, according to Hart, \"on a daily basis\" while she was working at Spencer Press. Hart testified that she was so distraught by these comments that she told Halasz that he \"shouldn't be harassing [Johnson] about his religion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson's testimony that Halasz consistently harassed him about his religious beliefs was also corroborated by Norma Crawford, a friend of Johnson. Crawford testified that Johnson frequently called her from work when he was upset and told her that he was being harassed at work because of his religion. On several of these occasions, according to Crawford, Johnson was crying when he called her.

At one point, Halasz took a knife out of its sheath and put the point of it under Johnson's chin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson complained to the human resources department about the treatment he was receiving from Halasz about six different times over the course of his employment. Each time, he was told that there was nothing that could be done and, that if he did not like the treatment he was receiving, he could leave the company. At one point, the human resources person to whom Johnson complained told him that she could not pursue his complaints about Halasz because if she did she would be fired. Johnson also filed several requests to transfer into another division within Spencer Press, each of which was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 28, 2000, Halasz resigned his position from Spencer Press. He had been experiencing frequent panic attacks at work, and at one point he had needed to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance as a result of a panic attack. He also had suffered from severe depression. On May 2, he began another job at Hannaford Brothers, a supermarket chain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson subsequently filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. After Johnson filed these complaints, Halasz came to Johnson's house and threatened to beat him up if he maintained his complaints. He also told Johnson that as a result of the complaints, he had been forced to take harassment classes at Spencer Press and that he had learned that he had discriminated against Johnson on the basis of his religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2003, a jury returned a verdict in which it concluded that Spencer Press harassed Johnson because of his religion or religious beliefs and that Johnson was constructively discharged from Spencer Press because of that harassment. The jury also found that Spencer Press had not independently taken any specific adverse employment action against Johnson on the basis of his religion. The jury awarded Johnson $400,000 in compensatory damages and $750,000 in punitive damages. Spencer Press did not file a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spencer Press did move for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 59, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. That motion was denied, and judgment was entered in favor of Johnson on the harassment claim. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(b)(3)(D), the sum of compensatory and punitive damages was capped at $300,000. Johnson was also awarded $1,227.94 in back pay, which represented Johnson's wage loss between May 2, 2000 and December 8, 2000, the period he was employed at Hannaford Brothers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spencer Press appeals both the district court's denial of its motion for a new trial and the underlying judgment.

A district court should only grant such motions if \"the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Ramos v.

Spencer Press argues that there was no causal link to religion and that the harassment was not severe and pervasive. To prevail on a harassment claim based on a supervisor's conduct, Johnson needed to carry his burden that: (1) he was a member of a protected class; (2) he was subject to uninvited harassment; (3) the offending conduct was because of his religion; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to affect the terms and conditions of employment; (5) the offending conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive; and (6) there was a basis for employer liability. <i>Rivera v. P.R. Aqueduct &amp; Sewers Auth.,</i> 331 F.3d 183, 189 (1st Cir.2003); <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 728. Spencer Press argues that the jury's conclusion in favor of Johnson was against the clear weight of the evidence on both prongs (3) and (4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In advancing the claim that any harassment was not due to religion, Spencer Press relies heavily on <i>Rivera,</i> in which we noted a \"conceptual gap between an environment that is offensive to a person of strong religious sensibilities and an environment that is offensive because of hostility to the religion guiding those sensibilities.\" 331 F.3d at 190.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Although Spencer Press admits that there may have been several isolated incidents in which the harassment manifested itself in comments implicating religion, it argues that this was not sufficient for the jury to conclude that Johnson was harassed <i>because of</i> his religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a new trial. Soon after Halasz was promoted to custodial supervisor, he became aware that Johnson was a religious person. At approximately the same time, he started making extremely inappropriate and lewd comments to Johnson. At first, only some of these remarks explicitly targeted Johnson's religion: Halasz repeatedly said that Johnson \"must be Catholic\" because he did not want to do certain things. Gradually, though, the harassment came to focus unabashedly on Johnson's religious views. Halasz repeatedly called Johnson a \"religious freak,\" told him not to talk about \"religious bullshit,\" said that because of his religion he was not getting sex, and told him to \"take [the Virgin] Mary and turn her upside down and pull her dress over her head.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost all of the inappropriate comments concerning Johnson's religion focused on a consistent theme: that Johnson was too chaste and sober for Halasz's taste and that this was because of Johnson's religious beliefs. Halasz did not make similarly inappropriate and offensive comments to other Spencer Press employees. Given the consistency of the harassment that specifically invoked Johnson's religion and the more frequent harassment that did not, the jury could easily have concluded that the underlying motivation &#8212; religious discrimination &#8212; was the same for each. The jury also could have easily concluded that this motivation stemmed from Halasz's animosity towards Johnson's religious beliefs; indeed, Halasz explicitly attributed Johnson's chastity and sobriety to his religious convictions. As explained in <i>Rivera,</i> \"conduct need not be explicitly religious to constitute harassment because of religion.\" 331 F.3d at 190 n. 2; <i>see Venters v. City of Delphi,</i> 123 F.3d 956, 973 (7th Cir.1997) (religious harassment can be established through indirect comments that are not on their face about religion); <i>cf. Landrau-Romero v. Banco Popular De Puerto Rico,</i> 212 F.3d 607, 614 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Alleged conduct that is not explicitly racial in nature may, in appropriate circumstances, be considered along with more overtly discriminatory conduct in assessing a Title VII harassment claim.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For similar reasons, we reject Spencer Press's argument that it was against the clear weight of the evidence for the jury to find that the harassment endured by Johnson was sufficiently \"severe or pervasive\" to affect a \"term, condition, or privilege of employment.\" <i>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson,</i> 477 U.S. 57, 67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986). Whether the harassment was severe or pervasive \"must be answered by reference to `all the circumstances,' including the `frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'\" <i>Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 18 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993)). \"Subject to some policing at the outer bounds, it is for the jury to weigh those factors and decide whether the harassment was of a kind or to a degree that a reasonable person would have felt that it affected the conditions of her employment.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The description of facts set forth earlier provides more than ample support for the jury's conclusion. Halasz repeatedly and continuously insulted Johnson and mocked his religious convictions. The harassment occurred throughout Johnson's work day, including when he was attempting to perform his custodial duties. On multiple occasions, Halasz threatened Johnson with violence and once he actually placed the point of a knife under Johnson's chin. In sum, there was more than ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion that the harassment was severe and pervasive. <i>See White v. N.H. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 260-61 (1st Cir.2000) (finding that \"disgusting comments\" and conversations that occurred \"everyday\" could support a finding that harassment was severe and pervasive).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Spencer Press's Challenge to the Punitive Damages Award</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spencer Press argues that the jury did not have sufficient evidence to award punitive damages because Halasz was not acting \"in a managerial capacity\" during the course of Johnson's employment. <i>Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n,</i> 527 U.S. 526, 545-46, 119 S.Ct. 2118, 144 L.Ed.2d 494 (1999). Spencer Press admits that the jury rationally could have rejected its affirmative defense to an award of punitive damages that it had exercised reasonable care to avoid harassment and to eliminate it when it might occur. <i>Id.</i> at 545, 119 S.Ct. 2118.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The availability of punitive damages is not a live issue. The jury awarded Johnson $400,000 in compensatory damages and $750,000 in punitive damages. Acting pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(b)(3)(D) and Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4613(2)(B)(8)(e)(iv), both of which cap the sum of punitive and compensatory damages for employers with over 500 employees, the district court entered judgment for Johnson for $300,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Because the compensatory damages award was itself greater than the statutory cap, the award would have been the same regardless of whether the jury awarded any punitive damages. <i>See Quint v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co.,</i> 172 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.1999) (declining to address whether a compensatory damages award was excessive because the award of punitive damages exceeded the statutory cap); <i>Hogan v. Bangor &amp; Aroostook R.R.

It is the district court's prerogative to craft the \"particular verbiage\" that it will use in its jury instructions. <i>Febres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp.,</i> 214 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir.2000). So long as that language properly explains the controlling legal standards and is not unduly confusing or misleading, it will not be second-guessed on appeal. <i>See id.; Brown v.

There is no requirement that the word \"extreme\" be used in instructing the jury on a harassment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Johnson's Cross-Appeal Regarding Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson cross-appeals the district court's summary judgment and post-trial determinations that, as a matter of law, he is not entitled to any back pay or front pay for any period beyond December 8, 2000. Spencer Press raises no questions about Johnson's preservation of these issues for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The availability of back pay and front pay is not affected by the cap on compensatory and punitive damages. Both federal and Maine law clearly exclude awards of back pay from the statutory cap on the sum of compensatory and punitive damages. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(b)(2); Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4613(2)(B)(8)(d). And the Supreme Court has recently clarified that the same rule applies to awards of front pay. <i>Pollard v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 532 U.S. 843, 848, 121 S.Ct. 1946, 150 L.Ed.2d 62 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An award of back pay compensates plaintiffs for lost wages and benefits between the time of the discharge and the trial court judgment. <i>See</i> Lindemann &amp; Grossman, <i>Employment Discrimination Law</i> 635-37 (Cane, Jr. et al. eds., 3d ed.1996). Front pay, by contrast, is \"money awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement.\" <i>Pollard,</i> 532 U.S. at 846, 121 S.Ct. 1946; <i>see</i> Lindemann &amp; Grossman, at 639-42. Front pay thus compensates plaintiffs for lost wages that may accrue after the conclusion of the trial. Both back pay and front pay are authorized by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(1), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court may ... order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay (payable by the employer, employment agency, or labor organization, as the case may be, responsible for the unlawful employment practice), or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the Commission. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the back pay period, individuals have an obligation to exercise \"reasonable diligence\" in finding alternative suitable employment. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(1); <i>Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC,</i> 458 U.S. 219, 231-32, 102 S.Ct. 3057, 73 L.Ed.2d 721 (1982) (an \"unemployed or underemployed claimant, like all other Title VII claimants, is subject to the statutory duty to minimize damages set out in\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(1)); <i>Carey v. Mt. Desert Island Hosp.,</i> 156 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir.1998). Thus, awards of back pay are offset by any wages that could have been earned with reasonable diligence after the illegal discharge, regardless of whether they were actually earned. <i>See</i> &#167; 2000e-5(g)(1); <i>Quinones Candelario v. Postmaster Gen. of United States,</i> 906 F.2d 798, 799-802 (1st Cir.1990). Failures to mitigate damages can take a variety of forms, including not looking for new employment, <i>see, e.g., Hansard v. Pepsi-Cola Metro. Bottling Co.,</i> 865 F.2d 1461, 1468 (5th Cir.1989), finding new employment but voluntarily quitting, <i>see, e.g., EEOC v. Delight Wholesale Co.,</i> 973 F.2d 664, 670 (8th Cir.1992), or, as in this case, finding new employment and getting discharged for misconduct, <i>see, e.g., Brady v. Thurston Motor Lines, Inc.,</i> 753 F.2d 1269, 1277 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court laid out the basic standards for awarding back pay in <i>Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</i> 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). That opinion clarified that in cases of unlawful discrimination, \"back pay should be denied only for reasons which, if applied generally, would not frustrate the central statutory purposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 421, 95 S.Ct. 2362. Despite its equitable nature, back pay is therefore \"a presumptive entitlement of a plaintiff who successfully prosecutes an employment discrimination case.\" <i>Thurman v. Yellow Freight Systs., Inc.,</i> 90 F.3d 1160, 1171 (6th Cir.1996). In this circuit, juries are generally entrusted with decisions on back pay when the jurors are already resolving issues of liability and compensatory damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See Santiago-Negron v. Castro-Davila,</i> 865 F.2d 431, 441 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awards of front pay, by contrast, are generally entrusted to the district judge's discretion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and are available in a more limited set of circumstances than back pay. <i>See Lussier v. Runyon,</i> 50 F.3d 1103, 1108-09 (1st Cir.1995). Front pay should not be awarded unless reinstatement is impracticable or impossible. <i>Wildman v. Lerner Stores Corp.,</i> 771 F.2d 605, 616 (1st Cir.1985). Even then, awards of front pay are discretionary, in part because they necessarily involve predictions of events yet to come. <i>See id.; Lussier,</i> 50 F.3d at 1109. For these reasons, district court decisions as to front pay are generally afforded more deference than decisions as to back pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Johnson stopped mitigating his damages about seven months after he left Spencer Press, when he was fired on December 8, 2000 from his subsequent job at Hannaford Brothers, a major supermarket chain in Maine. Johnson had started that job only a few days after leaving Spencer Press. Johnson was found eating food for which he had not paid, in violation of Hannaford company rules. This failure to mitigate damages, held the district court, eliminated the availability of either back pay or front pay for any time period after December 8.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Moreover, the district court found that there was insufficient evidence that the mistreatment Johnson endured at Spencer Press was causally responsible for his being fired from Hannaford. The court concluded that Johnson's own lay testimony to this effect did not create an issue of fact and that Johnson's expert was not \"specific enough\" on the link between Johnson's disability and his misbehavior at Hannaford.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson's cross-appeal does not dispute the conclusion that Spencer Press was not responsible for his termination from Hannaford. Instead, Johnson's basic argument is that the district court misunderstood the implications of his being fired from Hannaford for the availability of both front and back pay. Johnson argues that his termination from Hannaford only tolled the availability of back pay until he was able to find another job, and that the district court erroneously held that the availability of back pay was permanently cut off at that point. Johnson makes a similar argument as to front pay, claiming that the district court still had discretion to award front pay even after he was fired from Hannaford. Furthermore, Johnson says that he was unable to find a job after he was fired from Hannaford because he was psychologically completely disabled and Spencer Press is responsible for this disability. As a result, Johnson argues, Spencer Press is liable for back pay after he was fired from Hannaford because it was responsible for his inability to end the tolling period. Similarly, Johnson says that the district court could also have awarded front pay on this rationale. The analytical issues as to back pay and front pay are similar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Back pay</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of the legal principles used by the district court in determining the availability of back pay is de novo. <i>Reich v. Cambridgeport Air Sys.,</i> 26 F.3d 1187, 1190 (1st Cir.1994). Johnson's appeal raises a number of difficult issues. As Johnson notes, the district court's final holding was that once Johnson was fired from Hannaford, he was no longer eligible for any back pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was correct that once Johnson was fired from Hannaford for misconduct, he was no longer mitigating his damages, as was required. But that did not mean that the possibility of back pay was permanently cut off. Although the district court did not explicitly endorse, or even give reasons for, such a rule, its holding necessarily relied on this supposition of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> We hold that this was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, at least two circuit courts have found that back pay awards can accrue for periods after an employee is terminated from an \"employer B\" when the job at \"employer B\" was serving to mitigate damages arising from discriminatory conduct by \"employer A.\" <i>See Delight Wholesale,</i> 973 F.2d at 670 (back pay period was temporarily tolled after plaintiff voluntarily quit for personal reasons and began to run once she found a new job); <i>Brady,</i> 753 F.2d at 1278-80 (back pay is temporarily tolled after an employee is fired for misconduct in the course of mitigating damages from a previous illegal discharge and begins again once the employee finds another job). These holdings stem, at least in part, from the NLRB's rule on the issue, first articulated in <i>Knickerbocker Plastic Co.,</i> 132 N.L.R.B. 1209, 1215, 1961 WL 15694 (1961):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further find that, as a result of such quitting, each of these claimants shall be deemed to have earned for the remainder of the period for which each is awarded back pay the hourly wage being earned at the time such quitting occurred. Therefore, an offset computed on the appropriate rate per hour will be deducted as interim earnings from the gross back pay of each of these claimants. <i>This offset shall be made applicable from the date of the unjustified quitting throughout the remainder of the back pay period for each particular claimant.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Because Title VII's back pay language was \" `expressly modeled' on the analogous remedial provision of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)\" the \"principles developed under the NLRA generally guide, but do not bind, courts in tailoring remedies under Title VII.\" <i>Ford Motor Co.,</i> 458 U.S. at 226 n. 8, 102 S.Ct. 3057 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that back pay is not permanently terminated when an employee is fired for misconduct or voluntarily quits interim employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> This view comports with the purpose of the back pay remedy as articulated in <i>Albemarle. Albemarle</i> taught that back pay is a presumptive entitlement of a victim of discrimination and that the discriminating employer is responsible for all wage losses that result from its unlawful discrimination, at least until the time of judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> 422 U.S. at 419-21, 95 S.Ct. 2362. Had there been no discrimination at employer A, the employee would never have come to work (or have been fired) from employer B.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The discriminating employer (employer A) should not benefit from the windfall of not paying the salary differential when the employee is re-employed by employer C.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Further, the use of per se rules is contrary to the general principle that the necessary balancing of the equities requires a case-by-case approach. <i>Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> 889 F.2d 314, 321 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc) (\"[T]he hallmark of equity is the ability to assess all relevant facts and circumstances and tailor appropriate relief on a case by case basis.\"); <i>Medlock v. Ortho Biotech, Inc.,</i> 164 F.3d 545, 555 (10th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 528 U.S. 813, 120 S.Ct. 48, 145 L.Ed.2d 42 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, we need not craft general principles for how back pay should be calculated when an employee who has been discriminated against is fired from intervening employment. But our holding does require us to reach a second issue. Here, once Johnson was fired from Hannaford, he never sought out employment before trial in a further attempt to mitigate damages. Johnson explains that he did not seek further employment because he was unable to work as he suffered from a total psychological disability; indeed, Johnson received a 100 percent non-service connected disability rating from the Veteran's Administration. Some courts have adopted a rule that if a plaintiff is unable to mitigate damages due to a disability not caused by the discriminatory employer, that disability cuts off back pay liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> <i>Lathem v. Dep't of Children &amp; Youth Servs.,</i> 172 F.3d 786, 794 (11th Cir.1999) (\"[C]ourts exclude periods where a plaintiff is unavailable to work, such as periods of disability, from the back pay award.\"); <i>Starceski v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp.,</i> 54 F.3d 1089, 1101 (3rd Cir.1995) (\"[A]s a general rule ... an employer who has discriminated need not reimburse the plaintiffs for salary loss attributable to the plaintiffs and unrelated to the employment discrimination.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, Johnson does not argue that a disability arising independently of the discriminatory employer does not cut off back pay, so we do not rule on the issue. Johnson does, however, argue that there was evidence that his disability was caused by the harassment he endured at Spencer Press. If it was, he says, then both back pay and front pay should have been available even after he was fired from Hannaford for misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson is correct that several courts have held that an employee who is unable to work due to a disability is not precluded from receiving back pay when the employer \"caused\" the disability. This court has, applying Massachusetts law, endorsed that rule. <i>See Blockel v. J.C. Penney Co.,</i> 337 F.3d 17, 27-28 (1st Cir.2003). We now extend that holding to Title VII; an employee who cannot mitigate damages because of the unlawful actions of the employer can still receive back pay. <i>See Lathem,</i> 172 F.3d at 794 (\"[A] Title VII claimant is entitled to an award of back pay where the defendant's discriminatory conduct caused the disability.\"); <i>Durham Life Ins. Co. v. Evans,</i> 166 F.3d 139, 157 (3d Cir.1999) (\"Because [the employer's] conduct affirmatively impaired [the employee's] ability to mitigate her damages, it would be inequitable to reduce her back pay award in this case.\"). This rule is merely a logical corollary of the principle that the victims of discrimination should be restored, \"so far as possible ... to a position where they would have been were it not for the unlawful discrimination.\" <i>Albemarle,</i> 422 U.S. at 421, 95 S.Ct. 2362. If the employer's unlawful conduct caused the employee's inability to mitigate damages, then the employer should be liable for the resulting consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the evidence provided by Johnson does not allow him to take advantage of this rule. That evidence does no more than create an issue regarding whether the harassment at Spencer Press was one among numerous other independent and significant contributing factors to Johnson's psychological disability. Besides his own testimony, the only evidence that Johnson offered was the testimony of one expert, Dr. Ananis. Dr. Ananis stated in a deposition that Johnson</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">had been able to maintain a certain degree of functioning and employment until the events which took place during his employment at Spencer Press, including the harassment he stated he received while he worked there. I am aware that Mr. Johnson had other issues in his life, including family deaths, divorce, and problems with his sons, and I did not make a determination as to what event or events, if any, caused his depression and panic and anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, it is clear to me that the events at Spencer Press relating to the harassment he stated he received from his supervisor exacerbated his depression and panic and anxiety disorders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this testimony may have created a genuine question of fact about whether there was <i>some</i> relationship between the harassment at Spencer Press and Johnson's disability, it was not sufficient for Johnson to escape summary judgment on the issue. Given that Johnson was able to find a new job at Hannaford immediately after leaving Spencer Press and then to keep the job for the next seven months and given that Johnson has had numerous other significant problems in his life that may have been causally related to his disability, the evidence was insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson's own testimony does not bridge the gap. Johnson confirmed that he had suffered from depression and anxiety since 1993, and that he had family problems as well as the problems he suffered at Spencer Press. But he did not, and could not (owing to his lack of expertise), testify that his inability to get a job after Hannaford was caused by the harassment at Spencer Press.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Front Pay</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reasons that we affirm the denial of back pay after December 8, 2000, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in the district court's refusal to grant front pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Johnson also sued Spencer Press, Inc., the parent corporation of Spencer Press of Maine, Inc.

The district court granted summary judgment to Spencer Press on the disability discrimination claim, and Johnson does not appeal that determination. The district court did not grant summary judgment to Spencer Press on the retaliation claim, but, based on the jury's verdict, judgment was entered against Johnson on this claim and Johnson also does not appeal this determination</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The parties have not argued that there are material differences between Title VII and the Maine statute</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Spencer Press argues in its opening brief that it is also appealing the district court's refusal to grant judgment as a matter of law, and that this holding should be reviewed de novo. But after the jury reached its verdict, Spencer Press filed only a motion for a new trial under Rule 59, and not for a judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b). Accordingly, Spencer Press has waived its earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law and is not entitled to appellate review on the issue<i>See Cambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc.,</i> 85 F.3d 752, 759 (1st Cir.1996); <i>Pinkham v. Burgess,</i> 933 F.2d 1066, 1070 (1st Cir.1991). Even so, we observe that an objectively reasonable jury could easily have reached the result here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> <i>Rivera</i> upheld an award of summary judgment to the employer on de novo review. 331 F.3d at 185. Had Spencer Press moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50, the same standard of review would apply. <i>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Here, by contrast, the denial of Spencer Press's motion for a new trial under Rule 59 must meet the more difficult standard of abuse of discretion. <i>See supra.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> This amount did not include the district court's additional award to Johnson of $1,227.94 in back pay</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> However, \"[w]here only reinstatement and back pay are requested or if they are the only issues, in addition to liability, remaining in the case then both reinstatement and back pay shall be for the court.\"<i>Santiago-Negron,</i> 865 F.2d at 441.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> There is some dispute, which need not concern us, as to whether a jury should make calculations, if disputed, for purposes of the award<i>See</i> Lindemann &amp; Grossman, at 640-41.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The district court's initial ruling on this issue was that \"the value of the Hannaford wages and benefits, whatever it is, can be treated as an ongoing offset to Johnson's loss resulting from leaving [Spencer Press].\" This holding would have entitled Johnson to receive the differential between his wages at Hannaford and Spencer Press not only for the period he was employed at Hannaford from May 2 to December 8, 2000 (the $1,227.94), but also for the period after December 8, 2000. After trial, the district court altered its decision, holding that back pay was only available \"for the time during which the plaintiff was employed at Hannaford Bros.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The district court, in light of its ruling on the availability of front pay, granted Spencer Press's motion<i>in limine</i> to exclude an expert witness who would present a statistical model predicting Johnson's lost front pay. Because we ultimately conclude that Johnson was not entitled to front or back pay beyond December 8, 2000, we affirm the district court's refusal to consider the expert testimony offered to prove the economic consequences of Johnson's termination from Hannaford.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> If this conclusion was incorrect &#8212; as we think it was &#8212; then a series of issues normally would arise about how to calculate back pay once an employee is fired from interim employment while attempting to mitigate damages stemming from unlawful discrimination. One such issue is whether back pay should be withheld for the period during which the employee is trying to find another job, or should remain at the level it was at prior to the firing. Although we note this question below, we leave it unresolved because of an intervening dispositive fact: Johnson was unable to find employment after being fired from Hannaford because he was totally disabled and he did not produce sufficient evidence that Spencer Press caused that disability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The district court's failure to address Johnson's argument that Spencer Press was responsible for his total disability is attributable to the court's belief that the issue was irrelevant because Johnson's termination from Hannaford was dispositive of the issue. After all, Johnson filed a motion for reconsideration that specifically claimed that the district court had neglected Spencer Press's responsibility for his ultimate disability, and the district court denied it without comment. In the end, however, the reason for the district court's error is not relevant to the analysis; all that is pertinent is that the error was made</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> We do not suggest that a jury is required to extend the period of back pay under the circumstances, but only that there is no rule of law precluding it from doing so</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> This issue is different from the issue of cutting off back and front pay when there is after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing that would have resulted in the employee's discharge from employer A. In such cases, the Supreme Court has held that both front and back pay are indeed cut off at the time that the defendant discovers evidence that would have led it to fire the plaintiff on legitimate grounds<i>McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ'g Co.,</i> 513 U.S. 352, 361-62, 115 S.Ct. 879, 130 L.Ed.2d 852 (1995). That result follows from the simple guiding principle that the employee should be restored to the position he or she would have been in absent the discrimination: the employee would have been fired regardless of the discrimination as a result of the misconduct at the defendant's place of employment. <i>See id.</i> at 362, 115 S.Ct. 879.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> There is a sub-issue about whether back pay, offset by deemed wages from employer B, should continue while the employee diligently searches for post-employer-B employment. The view of the Fourth and Fifth Circuits is that back pay should equal zero during \"periods of unemployment following justified discharge\" because \"[d]uring such a period the claimant has excluded himself from the employment market.\"<i>Brady,</i> 753 F.2d at 1280; <i>see Patterson v. P.H.P. Healthcare Corp.,</i> 90 F.3d 927, 935 (5th Cir.1996). Notably, though, this perspective is in opposition to the NLRB's rule in <i>Knickerbocker,</i> which would leave a back pay award unchanged after an employee had been fired from a job at which she was mitigating damages from a prior unlawful termination. <i>See Knickerbocker,</i> 132 N.L.R.B. at 1215. It also appears to be at odds with the rule in the Eighth Circuit. <i>See NLRB v. Hopcroft Art &amp; Stained Glass Works, Inc.,</i> 692 F.2d 63, 65 (8th Cir.1982) (\"[T]he amount the employee would have earned had he not quit is to be offset for the remainder of the back pay period.\"). Leaving the back pay award unchanged after the employee is fired from interim employment, the logic goes, would put the employee in the position that he would have been in had he exercised reasonable diligence in never being fired.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Yet another sub-issue that we note involves how to calculate the back pay award while the plaintiff is employed at employer C. This is particularly difficult when the salary at employer B was higher than the salary at employer C. The Brady court held that the greater of the two salaries should be used for calculating back pay while the employee is at employer C<i>See Brady,</i> 753 F.2d at 1278-80. We do not reach this issue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Why this should be so is not self-evident. If the plaintiff would have been entitled to some form of salary continuation or benefits for disability had he remained employed at the discriminatory employer, it is not clear why he would not be entitled to the equivalent if he became disabled from working post-employment and before trial. Indeed, at least one circuit has held that back pay awards should not be cut off due to a post-termination disability if the plaintiff would have been entitled to some form of salary continuation or disability benefits had he not been unlawfully terminated<i>Thornley v. Penton Publ'g, Inc.,</i> 104 F.3d 26, 31 (2d Cir.1997). This reasoning is simply a logical outgrowth of the principle that back pay should put the plaintiff in the position he or she would have been in but for the unlawful discrimination. <i>Cf. Gutzwiller v. Fenik,</i> 860 F.2d 1317, 1333 (6th Cir.1988) (back pay \"should include the salary, including any raises, which plaintiff would have received but for the discrimination, as well as sick leave, vacation pay, pension benefits and other fringe benefits she would have received but for discrimination\").</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Johnson does not raise this issue here because he presents no evidence and makes no claim that he would have been entitled to disability benefits at Spencer Press had he not been unlawfully terminated.</p>\n        <p>CYR, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Although I agree that the grant of summary judgment must be upheld, I write separately because the discussion in the majority opinion regarding whether the district court improperly predicated its decision on the legal principle that Johnson's termination by Hannaford permanently severed his entitlement to back pay is an academic exercise wholly unnecessary to the disposition of the appeal. Even if it were to be assumed that this principle constituted an implicit rationale upon which the district court relied &#8212; which I seriously doubt &#8212; its adoption plainly did not constitute outcome-determinative error. Rather, just as the Rule 56 proffer made by Johnson (<i>viz.,</i> the Ananis deposition) was not sufficient to prove that SPM caused the misconduct that led to his termination by Hannaford, so too it logically could not constitute evidence that SPM caused Johnson's full disability. Thus, as Johnson was required to bear the burden of proof on causation, SPM was entitled to summary judgment under either legal theory.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Spencer Press promptly moved for summary judgment on these claims. The district court denied the motions as to Johnson's underlying discrimination and harassment claims and as to the availability of punitive damages, but held, as a matter of law, that Johnson was not entitled to any front pay or back pay for any time after December 8, 2000. Johnson was fired for misconduct on that date from Hannaford Brothers, his employer immediately after he left Spencer Press.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case proceeded to trial before a jury on April 28, 2003 and lasted four days. The testimony presented at trial, which is recounted in the light most favorable to Johnson, <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771503\"><a href=\"/opinion/771503/julia-m-orourke-v-city-of-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 717 (1st Cir.2001), established the following account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson received a B.S. in Bible Studies from Valley Forge Christian College in 1978 and served as a pastor at the Beech Ridge Assembly of God Church from May 1979 to October 1981. In 1981, Johnson resigned from his position at the church and found a new job at the Paul Dever State School for the mentally retarded, which he stayed in until July 1990. Despite leaving his official position at the church, Johnson remained very active in religious activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1991, Johnson began working as a custodian at Spencer Press, a printing company. After Johnson started at Spencer Press, he expressed to both his supervisor at the time and his co-workers a desire to have Sundays off from work. Although Johnson had to work most Sundays, his first few months at Spencer Press were incident-free.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stephen Halasz became the supervisor of the custodial department at Spencer Press in May of 1992. Some time shortly thereafter, Johnson expressed to Halasz a desire to have Sundays off, if possible. Johnson had also had discussions with co-workers in which he revealed his religious beliefs. Starting either in late 1992 or early 1993, Halasz began asking Johnson about his religious views. Halasz testified that he understood the reason that Johnson did not like to work on Sundays was because he wanted to go to church. Halasz also testified that he was aware that Johnson was religious before he found out in 1995 that Johnson used to be a minister.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after Halasz was promoted to the position of supervisor, he started making inappropriate and lewd comments to Johnson. Johnson recounted one incident in late 1992 in which Halasz told him to \"help hold my dick\" and another incident in which Halasz said Johnson looked tired and told a co-worker that \"if Al fucks like he works, then he must be slow as a nigger.\" Halasz made multiple other inappropriate and sexually explicit comments to Johnson throughout 1992 and 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least two of these remarks specifically targeted Johnson's religious beliefs. At one point, Halasz tried to show Johnson a Playboy magazine and said that he \"must be Catholic\" because he got flustered whenever Halasz made comments about sex. Johnson said that on another occasion in 1992, Halasz proclaimed to another custodian that \"Al doesn't fuck, drink or smoke, he must be a Catholic.\" Halasz admitted to making derogatory remarks to Johnson and teasing him for being Catholic. He also said that he remembered calling Johnson a Catholic when he refused to look at a Playboy magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upset by Halasz's treatment of him, Johnson started in 1994 to keep notes of \"significant\" events that he considered \"hostile or demeaning.\" Johnson kept notes of numerous instances of harassment by Halasz that occurred from 1992 until May 2000, when Johnson left Spencer Press. These included Halasz's comments that Johnson should suck Halasz's dick, that Halasz hoped a deer would \"run[] out of the woods and suck[][his] cock,\" and that Johnson should give his boss a \"blow job.\" Halasz did not make comments like these to any of the other custodians at Spencer Press. One of Johnson's former co-workers, Patrick Hubbard, confirmed that Halasz consistently and frequently called Johnson names such as \"fucking queer,\" \"fucking cock sucker,\" and \"fucking lazy.\" Hubbard testified that he never heard Halasz call any other workers by these names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A significant percentage of the derogatory comments that Halasz made from 1994 to 2000 involved Johnson's religion. Halasz called Johnson a \"religious freak\" and told Johnson that he was tired of his \"religious bullshit.\" According to Johnson, Halasz told him that because of his religious beliefs he \"wasn't out basically getting pussy.\" On April 27, 2000, a day before Johnson tendered his resignation to Spencer Press, Halasz told Johnson that \"he was getting real tired of hearing that [Johnson] couldn't work overtime on Sundays, that [he] was involved in church and classes, and [that Halasz] didn't like it.\" Halasz then asked Johnson \"if you could work overtime... and make $120 or love Jesus, what would you do?\" When Johnson answered that he would love Jesus, Halasz screamed \"well, why don't you take Mary and turn her upside down and pull her dress over her head.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Halasz's derogatory remarks involving religion were also corroborated by the testimony of Johnson's former co-worker. Karen Hart, who worked with Johnson as a custodian in 1999, testified that Halasz harassed Johnson about his religion and called him a \"religious freak.\" Hart recalled Halasz telling Johnson that \"I don't want to hear about your religious bullshit\" and, on another occasion, that he should \"go work with people that are Jehovah Witnesses and keep your comments to yourself [because] I don't want to hear about the religious stuff.\" Halasz also told Johnson that Johnson's job was more important than his church affairs. Halasz made these comments, according to Hart, \"on a daily basis\" while she was working at Spencer Press. Hart testified that she was so distraught by these comments that she told Halasz that he \"shouldn't be harassing [Johnson] about his religion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson's testimony that Halasz consistently harassed him about his religious beliefs was also corroborated by Norma Crawford, a friend of Johnson. Crawford testified that Johnson frequently called her from work when he was upset and told her that he was being harassed at work because of his religion. On several of these occasions, according to Crawford, Johnson was crying when he called her. Crawford testified that Johnson told her about Halasz's comment regarding the Virgin Mary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson also testified about several instances in which Halasz threatened to kill him with a hand grenade, run him over with a car, and shoot him with a bow and arrow. At one point, Halasz took a knife out of its sheath and put the point of it under Johnson's chin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson complained to the human resources department about the treatment he was receiving from Halasz about six different times over the course of his employment. Each time, he was told that there was nothing that could be done and, that if he did not like the treatment he was receiving, he could leave the company. At one point, the human resources person to whom Johnson complained told him that she could not pursue his complaints about Halasz because if she did she would be fired. Johnson also filed several requests to transfer into another division within Spencer Press, each of which was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 28, 2000, Halasz resigned his position from Spencer Press. He had been experiencing frequent panic attacks at work, and at one point he had needed to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance as a result of a panic attack. He also had suffered from severe depression. On May 2, he began another job at Hannaford Brothers, a supermarket chain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson subsequently filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. After Johnson filed these complaints, Halasz came to Johnson's house and threatened to beat him up if he maintained his complaints. He also told Johnson that as a result of the complaints, he had been forced to take harassment classes at Spencer Press and that he had learned that he had discriminated against Johnson on the basis of his religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2003, a jury returned a verdict in which it concluded that Spencer Press harassed Johnson because of his religion or religious beliefs and that Johnson was constructively discharged from Spencer Press because of that harassment. The jury also found that Spencer Press had not independently taken any specific adverse employment action against Johnson on the basis of his religion. The jury awarded Johnson $400,000 in compensatory damages and $750,000 in punitive damages. Spencer Press did not file a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spencer Press did move for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 59, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. That motion was denied, and judgment was entered in favor of Johnson on the harassment claim. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(b)(3)(D), the sum of compensatory and punitive damages was capped at $300,000. Johnson was also awarded $1,227.94 in back pay, which represented Johnson's wage loss between May 2, 2000 and December 8, 2000, the period he was employed at Hannaford Brothers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spencer Press appeals both the district court's denial of its motion for a new trial and the underlying judgment.

Spencer Press argues that there was no causal link to religion and that the harassment was not severe and pervasive. To prevail on a harassment claim based on a supervisor's conduct, Johnson needed to carry his burden that: (1) he was a member of a protected class; (2) he was subject to uninvited harassment; (3) the offending conduct was because of his religion; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to affect the terms and conditions of employment; (5) the offending conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive; and (6) there was a basis for employer liability. <i>Rivera v.

Spencer Press argues that the jury's conclusion in favor of Johnson was against the clear weight of the evidence on both prongs (3) and (4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In advancing the claim that any harassment was not due to religion, Spencer Press relies heavily on <i>Rivera,</i> in which we noted a \"conceptual gap between an environment that is offensive to a person of strong religious sensibilities and an environment that is offensive because of hostility to the religion guiding those sensibilities.\" 331 F.3d at 190.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Although Spencer Press admits that there may have been several isolated incidents in which the harassment manifested itself in comments implicating religion, it argues that this was not sufficient for the jury to conclude that Johnson was harassed <i>because of</i> his religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a new trial. Soon after Halasz was promoted to custodial supervisor, he became aware that Johnson was a religious person. At approximately the same time, he started making extremely inappropriate and lewd comments to Johnson. At first, only some of these remarks explicitly targeted Johnson's religion: Halasz repeatedly said that Johnson \"must be Catholic\" because he did not want to do certain things. Gradually, though, the harassment came to focus unabashedly on Johnson's religious views. Halasz repeatedly called Johnson a \"religious freak,\" told him not to talk about \"religious bullshit,\" said that because of his religion he was not getting sex, and told him to \"take [the Virgin] Mary and turn her upside down and pull her dress over her head.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost all of the inappropriate comments concerning Johnson's religion focused on a consistent theme: that Johnson was too chaste and sober for Halasz's taste and that this was because of Johnson's religious beliefs. Halasz did not make similarly inappropriate and offensive comments to other Spencer Press employees. Given the consistency of the harassment that specifically invoked Johnson's religion and the more frequent harassment that did not, the jury could easily have concluded that the underlying motivation &#8212; religious discrimination &#8212; was the same for each. The jury also could have easily concluded that this motivation stemmed from Halasz's animosity towards Johnson's religious beliefs; indeed, Halasz explicitly attributed Johnson's chastity and sobriety to his religious convictions. As explained in <i>Rivera,</i> \"conduct need not be explicitly religious to constitute harassment because of religion.\" 331 F.3d at 190 n. 2; <i>see Venters v.

Halasz repeatedly and continuously insulted Johnson and mocked his religious convictions. The harassment occurred throughout Johnson's work day, including when he was attempting to perform his custodial duties. On multiple occasions, Halasz threatened Johnson with violence and once he actually placed the point of a knife under Johnson's chin. In sum, there was more than ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion that the harassment was severe and pervasive. <i>See White v. N.H.

Johnson had started that job only a few days after leaving Spencer Press. Johnson was found eating food for which he had not paid, in violation of Hannaford company rules. This failure to mitigate damages, held the district court, eliminated the availability of either back pay or front pay for any time period after December 8.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Moreover, the district court found that there was insufficient evidence that the mistreatment Johnson endured at Spencer Press was causally responsible for his being fired from Hannaford. The court concluded that Johnson's own lay testimony to this effect did not create an issue of fact and that Johnson's expert was not \"specific enough\" on the link between Johnson's disability and his misbehavior at Hannaford.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson's cross-appeal does not dispute the conclusion that Spencer Press was not responsible for his termination from Hannaford. Instead, Johnson's basic argument is that the district court misunderstood the implications of his being fired from Hannaford for the availability of both front and back pay. Johnson argues that his termination from Hannaford only tolled the availability of back pay until he was able to find another job, and that the district court erroneously held that the availability of back pay was permanently cut off at that point. Johnson makes a similar argument as to front pay, claiming that the district court still had discretion to award front pay even after he was fired from Hannaford. Furthermore, Johnson says that he was unable to find a job after he was fired from Hannaford because he was psychologically completely disabled and Spencer Press is responsible for this disability. As a result, Johnson argues, Spencer Press is liable for back pay after he was fired from Hannaford because it was responsible for his inability to end the tolling period. Similarly, Johnson says that the district court could also have awarded front pay on this rationale.

Johnson's appeal raises a number of difficult issues. As Johnson notes, the district court's final holding was that once Johnson was fired from Hannaford, he was no longer eligible for any back pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was correct that once Johnson was fired from Hannaford for misconduct, he was no longer mitigating his damages, as was required. But that did not mean that the possibility of back pay was permanently cut off. Although the district court did not explicitly endorse, or even give reasons for, such a rule, its holding necessarily relied on this supposition of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> We hold that this was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, at least two circuit courts have found that back pay awards can accrue for periods after an employee is terminated from an \"employer B\" when the job at \"employer B\" was serving to mitigate damages arising from discriminatory conduct by \"employer A.\" <i>See Delight Wholesale,</i> 973 F.2d at 670 (back pay period was temporarily tolled after plaintiff voluntarily quit for personal reasons and began to run once she found a new job); <i>Brady,</i> 753 F.2d at 1278-80 (back pay is temporarily tolled after an employee is fired for misconduct in the course of mitigating damages from a previous illegal discharge and begins again once the employee finds another job).

But our holding does require us to reach a second issue. Here, once Johnson was fired from Hannaford, he never sought out employment before trial in a further attempt to mitigate damages. Johnson explains that he did not seek further employment because he was unable to work as he suffered from a total psychological disability; indeed, Johnson received a 100 percent non-service connected disability rating from the Veteran's Administration. Some courts have adopted a rule that if a plaintiff is unable to mitigate damages due to a disability not caused by the discriminatory employer, that disability cuts off back pay liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> <i>Lathem v.

Here, Johnson does not argue that a disability arising independently of the discriminatory employer does not cut off back pay, so we do not rule on the issue. Johnson does, however, argue that there was evidence that his disability was caused by the harassment he endured at Spencer Press. If it was, he says, then both back pay and front pay should have been available even after he was fired from Hannaford for misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson is correct that several courts have held that an employee who is unable to work due to a disability is not precluded from receiving back pay when the employer \"caused\" the disability.

Evans,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760950\"><a href=\"/opinion/760950/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1434-79-fair-emplpraccas-bna-160-74/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 157 (3d Cir.1999) (\"Because [the employer's] conduct affirmatively impaired [the employee's] ability to mitigate her damages, it would be inequitable to reduce her back pay award in this case.\"). This rule is merely a logical corollary of the principle that the victims of discrimination should be restored, \"so far as possible ... to a position where they would have been were it not for the unlawful discrimination.\" <i>Albemarle,</i> 422 U.S. at 421, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109299\"><a href=\"/opinion/109299/albemarle-paper-co-v-moody/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That evidence does no more than create an issue regarding whether the harassment at Spencer Press was one among numerous other independent and significant contributing factors to Johnson's psychological disability. Besides his own testimony, the only evidence that Johnson offered was the testimony of one expert, Dr. Ananis. Dr. Ananis stated in a deposition that Johnson</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">had been able to maintain a certain degree of functioning and employment until the events which took place during his employment at Spencer Press, including the harassment he stated he received while he worked there. I am aware that Mr. Johnson had other issues in his life, including family deaths, divorce, and problems with his sons, and I did not make a determination as to what event or events, if any, caused his depression and panic and anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, it is clear to me that the events at Spencer Press relating to the harassment he stated he received from his supervisor exacerbated his depression and panic and anxiety disorders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this testimony may have created a genuine question of fact about whether there was <i>some</i> relationship between the harassment at Spencer Press and Johnson's disability, it was not sufficient for Johnson to escape summary judgment on the issue. Given that Johnson was able to find a new job at Hannaford immediately after leaving Spencer Press and then to keep the job for the next seven months and given that Johnson has had numerous other significant problems in his life that may have been causally related to his disability, the evidence was insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson's own testimony does not bridge the gap. Johnson confirmed that he had suffered from depression and anxiety since 1993, and that he had family problems as well as the problems he suffered at Spencer Press. But he did not, and could not (owing to his lack of expertise), testify that his inability to get a job after Hannaford was caused by the harassment at Spencer Press.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Front Pay</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reasons that we affirm the denial of back pay after December 8, 2000, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in the district court's refusal to grant front pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Johnson also sued Spencer Press, Inc., the parent corporation of Spencer Press of Maine, Inc.

But after the jury reached its verdict, Spencer Press filed only a motion for a new trial under Rule 59, and not for a judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b). Accordingly, Spencer Press has waived its earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law and is not entitled to appellate review on the issue<i>See Cambridge Plating Co. v.

Here, by contrast, the denial of Spencer Press's motion for a new trial under Rule 59 must meet the more difficult standard of abuse of discretion. <i>See supra.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> This amount did not include the district court's additional award to Johnson of $1,227.94 in back pay</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> However, \"[w]here only reinstatement and back pay are requested or if they are the only issues, in addition to liability, remaining in the case then both reinstatement and back pay shall be for the court.\"<i>Santiago-Negron,</i> 865 F.2d at 441.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> There is some dispute, which need not concern us, as to whether a jury should make calculations, if disputed, for purposes of the award<i>See</i> Lindemann &amp; Grossman, at 640-41.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The district court's initial ruling on this issue was that \"the value of the Hannaford wages and benefits, whatever it is, can be treated as an ongoing offset to Johnson's loss resulting from leaving [Spencer Press].\" This holding would have entitled Johnson to receive the differential between his wages at Hannaford and Spencer Press not only for the period he was employed at Hannaford from May 2 to December 8, 2000 (the $1,227.94), but also for the period after December 8, 2000.

Because we ultimately conclude that Johnson was not entitled to front or back pay beyond December 8, 2000, we affirm the district court's refusal to consider the expert testimony offered to prove the economic consequences of Johnson's termination from Hannaford.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> If this conclusion was incorrect &#8212; as we think it was &#8212; then a series of issues normally would arise about how to calculate back pay once an employee is fired from interim employment while attempting to mitigate damages stemming from unlawful discrimination. One such issue is whether back pay should be withheld for the period during which the employee is trying to find another job, or should remain at the level it was at prior to the firing. Although we note this question below, we leave it unresolved because of an intervening dispositive fact: Johnson was unable to find employment after being fired from Hannaford because he was totally disabled and he did not produce sufficient evidence that Spencer Press caused that disability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The district court's failure to address Johnson's argument that Spencer Press was responsible for his total disability is attributable to the court's belief that the issue was irrelevant because Johnson's termination from Hannaford was dispositive of the issue. After all, Johnson filed a motion for reconsideration that specifically claimed that the district court had neglected Spencer Press's responsibility for his ultimate disability, and the district court denied it without comment. In the end, however, the reason for the district court's error is not relevant to the analysis; all that is pertinent is that the error was made</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> We do not suggest that a jury is required to extend the period of back pay under the circumstances, but only that there is no rule of law precluding it from doing so</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> This issue is different from the issue of cutting off back and front pay when there is after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing that would have resulted in the employee's discharge from employer A. In such cases, the Supreme Court has held that both front and back pay are indeed cut off at the time that the defendant discovers evidence that would have led it to fire the plaintiff on legitimate grounds<i>McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ'g Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117894\"><a href=\"/opinion/117894/mckennon-v-nashville-banner-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 361-62, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117894\"><a href=\"/opinion/117894/mckennon-v-nashville-banner-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span> (1995). That result follows from the simple guiding principle that the employee should be restored to the position he or she would have been in absent the discrimination: the employee would have been fired regardless of the discrimination as a result of the misconduct at the defendant's place of employment. <i>See id.</i> at 362, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117894\"><a href=\"/opinion/117894/mckennon-v-nashville-banner-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The view of the Fourth and Fifth Circuits is that back pay should equal zero during \"periods of unemployment following justified discharge\" because \"[d]uring such a period the claimant has excluded himself from the employment market.\"<i>Brady,</i> 753 F.2d at 1280; <i>see Patterson v. P.H.P. Healthcare Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722555\"><a href=\"/opinion/722555/donna-patterson-nicholas-brown-and-michael-l-adams-v-php-healthcare/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>, 935 (5th Cir.1996). Notably, though, this perspective is in opposition to the NLRB's rule in <i>Knickerbocker,</i> which would leave a back pay award unchanged after an employee had been fired from a job at which she was mitigating damages from a prior unlawful termination. <i>See Knickerbocker,</i> 132 N.L.R.B. at 1215. It also appears to be at odds with the rule in the Eighth Circuit. <i>See NLRB v. Hopcroft Art &amp; Stained Glass Works, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"410313\"><a href=\"/opinion/410313/national-labor-relations-board-v-hopcroft-art-stained-glass-works-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 65 (8th Cir.1982) (\"[T]he amount the employee would have earned had he not quit is to be offset for the remainder of the back pay period.\"). Leaving the back pay award unchanged after the employee is fired from interim employment, the logic goes, would put the employee in the position that he would have been in had he exercised reasonable diligence in never being fired.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Yet another sub-issue that we note involves how to calculate the back pay award while the plaintiff is employed at employer C. This is particularly difficult when the salary at employer B was higher than the salary at employer C. The Brady court held that the greater of the two salaries should be used for calculating back pay while the employee is at employer C<i>See Brady,</i> 753 F.2d at 1278-80. We do not reach this issue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Why this should be so is not self-evident. If the plaintiff would have been entitled to some form of salary continuation or benefits for disability had he remained employed at the discriminatory employer, it is not clear why he would not be entitled to the equivalent if he became disabled from working post-employment and before trial. Indeed, at least one circuit has held that back pay awards should not be cut off due to a post-termination disability if the plaintiff would have been entitled to some form of salary continuation or disability benefits had he not been unlawfully terminated<i>Thornley v. Penton Publ'g, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732466\"><a href=\"/opinion/732466/72-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1488-69-empl-prac-dec-p-44466-kenneth-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 31 (2d Cir.1997). This reasoning is simply a logical outgrowth of the principle that back pay should put the plaintiff in the position he or she would have been in but for the unlawful discrimination. <i>Cf. Gutzwiller v. Fenik,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513951\"><a href=\"/opinion/513951/kathryn-j-gutzwiller-cross-appellee-86-385286-3854-86-3916-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1317</span></a></span>, 1333 (6th Cir.1988) (back pay \"should include the salary, including any raises, which plaintiff would have received but for the discrimination, as well as sick leave, vacation pay, pension benefits and other fringe benefits she would have received but for discrimination\").</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Johnson does not raise this issue here because he presents no evidence and makes no claim that he would have been entitled to disability benefits at Spencer Press had he not been unlawfully terminated.</p>\n        <p>CYR, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Although I agree that the grant of summary judgment must be upheld, I write separately because the discussion in the majority opinion regarding whether the district court improperly predicated its decision on the legal principle that Johnson's termination by Hannaford permanently severed his entitlement to back pay is an academic exercise wholly unnecessary to the disposition of the appeal. Even if it were to be assumed that this principle constituted an implicit rationale upon which the district court relied &#8212; which I seriously doubt &#8212; its adoption plainly did not constitute outcome-determinative error. Rather, just as the Rule 56 proffer made by Johnson (<i>viz.,</i> the Ananis deposition) was not sufficient to prove that SPM caused the misconduct that led to his termination by Hannaford, so too it logically could not constitute evidence that SPM caused Johnson's full disability. Thus, as Johnson was required to bear the burden of proof on causation, SPM was entitled to summary judgment under either legal theory.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
