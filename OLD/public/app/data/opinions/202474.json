Petitioners Conilia Wijaya\n\nand Alfred Andre Martian, husband and wife, seek review of a final\n\norder of removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).\n\nWijaya,     the   wife,   filed    as    the    lead   applicant   for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT); Martian's application was derivative of Wijaya's.\n\nPetitioners appeal the denial of asylum and withholding of removal.\n\nThey   do   not   argue    error    in    the   Board's    affirmation   of   the\n\nImmigration Judge's (IJ) denial of relief under the CAT, and thus\n\nhave waived that issue.       The Immigration Judge (IJ) concluded that\n\nWijaya, the only witness at trial, was credible but did not qualify\n\nfor asylum because she failed to show either past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.               Because Martian's asylum\n\nclaim was derivative of Wijaya's, his claim also failed.                 The BIA\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision without opinion.\n\n             Wijaya and Martian are natives and citizens of Indonesia.\n\nBoth are practicing Christians and Wijaya is ethnic Chinese.                  They\n\nentered the United States on March 9, 2001, with valid six-month\n\ntourist     visas.    In    April    of    2004,    they   were    charged    with\n\noverstaying their visas.          In response, they conceded removability\n\non that ground and applied for asylum and withholding of removal.\n\nIn this petition for review, Wijaya argues that she has suffered\n\npast persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\nbased on her Christian religion and Chinese ethnicity.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f          Because the IJ found Wijaya credible, we relate the facts\n\nas she related them.    Wijaya testified orally and in writing that\n\nshe faced discrimination and harassment since her youth on account\n\nof her ethnic Chinese minority status and Christian religion.        She\n\nrecounted being discriminated against, teased, and bullied in\n\nelementary and secondary school because she was ethnic Chinese.\n\nThis discrimination continued in college and her workplace.\n\n          On May 13, 1998, Wijaya left work early after hearing\n\nthat mobs were rioting in the streets and targeting ethnic Chinese.\n\nAfter picking up her sister, she attempted to drive home. However,\n\nthere was a traffic jam on the highway and a group of people\n\nsurrounded her car, yelling \"Chinese must be killed.\"          The group\n\nbegan banging on Wijaya's trunk.    She managed to make a U-turn to\n\nescape the crowd.    She drove to the airport to seek refuge, along\n\nwith other ethnic Chinese. Wijaya was not physically harmed in the\n\nincident, but her car was damaged.     Wijaya also recounted that on\n\nDecember 24, 2000, when she and Martian were attending Christmas\n\nEve services at their church, she received a text message telling\n\nher that the Cathedral Church had been bombed.    She later found out\n\nthat several other churches and Christian schools had also been\n\nbombed that night.\n\n          On   cross-examination,   Wijaya   admitted   that   she   left\n\nIndonesia for Hong Kong in 2000, and returned voluntarily to\n\nIndonesia thereafter.   She also testified that, while most of her\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffamily is Buddhist, her mother is Catholic and has not been\n\npersonally threatened or harmed for practicing her religion; her\n\nmother has, however, been scared to attend church on occasion.\n\n           The     administrative     record       in   this   case   is     thin,\n\ncomprising only the State Department's 2003 International Religious\n\nFreedom   Report    on   Indonesia    and    the    State    Department's     2003\n\nIndonesia Country Report.            These reports corroborate Wijaya's\n\naccount of the Christmas Eve 2000 church bombings, but also note\n\nthat the government has put a leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah\n\nterrorist group on trial for the attacks.                   The reports detail\n\nviolence against practicing Christians, including the burning of 25\n\nchurches in the 2002 reporting period, but also highlight a \"sharp\n\ndrop\" in violence between Muslims and Christians.                 Finally, the\n\nreports   note   continued   official       discrimination      against     ethnic\n\nChinese, but also report progress in the government's promotion of\n\nracial and ethnic tolerance.\n\n           Although the IJ found Wijaya credible, he ruled that\n\nWijaya and her husband did not qualify for asylum based on past\n\npersecution or a reasonable fear of future persecution.                    The BIA\n\naffirmed without opinion.\n\n           Where, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ without opinion,\n\nthis court reviews the IJ's decision directly and treats the\n\n\"findings and conclusion of the IJ as the Board's own opinion.\"\n\nHerbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2003).                 We review\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe decision below for substantial evidence, accepting the IJ's\n\nfindings of fact if they are supported by \"reasonable, substantial,\n\nand probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"\n\nNjenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 338 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting INS\n\nv. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)). We will reverse only\n\nif \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to\n\nthe contrary.\"       8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).        A petitioner bears the\n\nburden of establishing eligibility for asylum \"by proving either\n\npast persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution,\" on account\n\nof her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.               Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 342\n\nF.3d 55, 58 (1st Cir. 2003).                A well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution can be shown in either of two ways.                    First, the\n\npetitioner may show a genuine subjective fear of persecution, along\n\nwith   \"credible,        direct,    and    specific   evidence\"    that    would\n\nobjectively support a reasonable fear of future individualized\n\npersecution.        Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(quoting Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\nSecond, a petitioner need not provide evidence that he would be\n\nsingled out for persecution if he establishes that there is \"a\n\npattern or practice in his or her country of nationality . . . of\n\npersecution    of    a   group     of   persons   similarly   situated    to   the\n\napplicant on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fa particular social group, or political opinion.\"               8 C.F.R. §\n\n1208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A).\n\n            Wijaya argues that she has suffered past persecution and\n\nhas a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her\n\nChristian religion and Chinese ethnicity.              We disagree.       The\n\nincidents recounted by Wijaya, though clearly frightening to her,\n\ndo not meet the high standard for showing past persecution.                We\n\nhave said that past persecution is more than \"unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering.\"           Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d\n\n258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).       We did not find past persecution in a\n\nsimilar case involving ethnic Chinese Christians from Indonesia who\n\nhad arguably suffered more direct harm than Wijaya. See Susanto v.\n\nGonzales, 439 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 2006) (past persecution not shown\n\nwhere home of ethnic Chinese Indonesian was vandalized and Muslims\n\nthrew stones at petitioner and fellow Christian worshipers). Here,\n\nWijaya was not physically harmed in the 1998 incident, and was not\n\ndirectly threatened after that. The only other basis for the claim\n\nof   past   persecution   is   the   text   message   she   received   during\n\nChristmas Eve services alerting her to a bombing at another church.\n\nWhile certainly disquieting to her, this incident does not make out\n\na case for past persecution.\n\n            In addition, Wijaya's evidence does not compel us to\n\nconclude that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nSuch a fear is shown where \"a reasonable person in the petitioner's\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcircumstances    would     fear    persecution      based   on    a   statutorily\n\nprotected ground.\"       Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 122 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     The IJ found that Wijaya had a subjective fear of\n\nfuture persecution, but not an objective fear of the same.                     We\n\nagree.     In   previous    asylum    cases   brought       by   ethnic   Chinese\n\nChristians, we have held that where the petitioner's family members\n\ncontinue to live safely in the home country and evidence in the\n\nrecord, such as State Department reports, does not objectively\n\nsupport the petitioner's fear of persecution, the petitioner's\n\nclaim must fail.      See id. at 122; Zheng v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 97,\n\n101 (1st Cir. 2005).        Here, Wijaya testified that her Catholic\n\nmother continues to reside in Indonesia without incident.                   Also,\n\nWijaya left Indonesia in 2000 and voluntarily returned, which\n\nundermines her claim of fear.         Finally, while the evidence in the\n\nrecord    certainly    shows      violence    and    discrimination       against\n\nChristians and ethnic Chinese, it also details improvements in the\n\ngovernment's prevention and prosecution of such incidents. Without\n\nmore, we are not compelled to conclude that Wijaya has a well-\n\nfounded fear of individualized persecution.             In addition, on such\n\na thin record, it is not possible to conclude that there is a\n\npattern   and   practice     of    persecution      against      ethnic   Chinese\n\nChristians in Indonesia such that Wijaya need not show an objective\n\nfear of future individual harm.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f           Finally, on appeal, Wijaya requests relief in the form of\n\nwithholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), but fails to develop\n\nany legal argument to support her request. Therefore, we deem this\n\nclaim waived.     See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir.   1990)   (\"[i]ssues   adverted    to   in   a   perfunctory   manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived.\").     Even if we were to consider the withholding request on\n\nits merits, because Wijaya does not meet the lower threshold for\n\nasylum, she also does not meet the higher standard for withholding\n\nof removal.     See Alvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (\"Since the standard for withholding deportation is more\n\nstringent, a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard\n\nfails, a fortiori, to satisfy the former.\").          Therefore, Wijaya's\n\napplication for withholding of removal was properly denied.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.   The decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

Petitioners Conilia Wijaya\n\nand Alfred Andre Martian, husband and wife, seek review of a final\n\norder of removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).\n\nWijaya,     the   wife,   filed    as    the    lead   applicant   for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT); Martian's application was derivative of Wijaya's.\n\nPetitioners appeal the denial of asylum and withholding of removal.\n\nThey   do   not   argue    error    in    the   Board's    affirmation   of   the\n\nImmigration Judge's (IJ) denial of relief under the CAT, and thus\n\nhave waived that issue.       The Immigration Judge (IJ) concluded that\n\nWijaya, the only witness at trial, was credible but did not qualify\n\nfor asylum because she failed to show either past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.               Because Martian's asylum\n\nclaim was derivative of Wijaya's, his claim also failed.                 The BIA\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision without opinion.\n\n             Wijaya and Martian are natives and citizens of Indonesia.\n\nBoth are practicing Christians and Wijaya is ethnic Chinese.                  They\n\nentered the United States on March 9, 2001, with valid six-month\n\ntourist     visas.    In    April    of    2004,    they   were    charged    with\n\noverstaying their visas.

These reports corroborate Wijaya's\n\naccount of the Christmas Eve 2000 church bombings, but also note\n\nthat the government has put a leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah\n\nterrorist group on trial for the attacks.

Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783402\"><a href=\"/opinion/783402/ricardo-f-velasquez-susana-d-granados-urizar-eluvia-r-granados-urizar/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (1st Cir. 2003).                A well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution can be shown in either of two ways.                    First, the\n\npetitioner may show a genuine subjective fear of persecution, along\n\nwith   \"credible,        direct,    and    specific   evidence\"    that    would\n\nobjectively support a reasonable fear of future individualized\n\npersecution.        Guzman v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200443\"><a href=\"/opinion/200443/guzman-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(quoting Ravindran v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 758 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\nSecond, a petitioner need not provide evidence that he would be\n\nsingled out for persecution if he establishes that there is \"a\n\npattern or practice in his or her country of nationality . . . of\n\npersecution    of    a   group     of   persons   similarly   situated    to   the\n\napplicant on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fa particular social group, or political opinion.\"               8 C.F.R. §\n\n1208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A).\n\n            Wijaya argues that she has suffered past persecution and\n\nhas a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her\n\nChristian religion and Chinese ethnicity.              We disagree.       The\n\nincidents recounted by Wijaya, though clearly frightening to her,\n\ndo not meet the high standard for showing past persecution.                We\n\nhave said that past persecution is more than \"unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering.\"           Nelson v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).       We did not find past persecution in a\n\nsimilar case involving ethnic Chinese Christians from Indonesia who\n\nhad arguably suffered more direct harm than Wijaya. See Susanto v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202090\"><a href=\"/opinion/202090/susanto-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2006) (past persecution not shown\n\nwhere home of ethnic Chinese Indonesian was vandalized and Muslims\n\nthrew stones at petitioner and fellow Christian worshipers). Here,\n\nWijaya was not physically harmed in the 1998 incident, and was not\n\ndirectly threatened after that. The only other basis for the claim\n\nof   past   persecution   is   the   text   message   she   received   during\n\nChristmas Eve services alerting her to a bombing at another church.\n\nWhile certainly disquieting to her, this incident does not make out\n\na case for past persecution.\n\n            In addition, Wijaya's evidence does not compel us to\n\nconclude that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nSuch a fear is shown where \"a reasonable person in the petitioner's\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcircumstances    would     fear    persecution      based   on    a   statutorily\n\nprotected ground.\"       Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 122 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     The IJ found that Wijaya had a subjective fear of\n\nfuture persecution, but not an objective fear of the same.                     We\n\nagree.     In   previous    asylum    cases   brought       by   ethnic   Chinese\n\nChristians, we have held that where the petitioner's family members\n\ncontinue to live safely in the home country and evidence in the\n\nrecord, such as State Department reports, does not objectively\n\nsupport the petitioner's fear of persecution, the petitioner's\n\nclaim must fail.      See id. at 122; Zheng v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201746\"><a href=\"/opinion/201746/zheng-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n101 (1st Cir. 2005).        Here, Wijaya testified that her Catholic\n\nmother continues to reside in Indonesia without incident.                   Also,\n\nWijaya left Indonesia in 2000 and voluntarily returned, which\n\nundermines her claim of fear.         Finally, while the evidence in the\n\nrecord    certainly    shows      violence    and    discrimination       against\n\nChristians and ethnic Chinese, it also details improvements in the\n\ngovernment's prevention and prosecution of such incidents. Without\n\nmore, we are not compelled to conclude that Wijaya has a well-\n\nfounded fear of individualized persecution.             In addition, on such\n\na thin record, it is not possible to conclude that there is a\n\npattern   and   practice     of    persecution      against      ethnic   Chinese\n\nChristians in Indonesia such that Wijaya need not show an objective\n\nfear of future individual harm.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f           Finally, on appeal, Wijaya requests relief in the form of\n\nwithholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), but fails to develop\n\nany legal argument to support her request. Therefore, we deem this\n\nclaim waived.     See United States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st\n\nCir.   1990)   (\"[i]ssues   adverted    to   in   a   perfunctory   manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived.\").     Even if we were to consider the withholding request on\n\nits merits, because Wijaya does not meet the lower threshold for\n\nasylum, she also does not meet the higher standard for withholding\n\nof removal.     See Alvarez-Flores v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545202\"><a href=\"/opinion/545202/william-alexander-alvarez-flores-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (\"Since the standard for withholding deportation is more\n\nstringent, a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard\n\nfails, a fortiori, to satisfy the former.\").          Therefore, Wijaya's\n\napplication for withholding of removal was properly denied.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.   The decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f</pre>",
