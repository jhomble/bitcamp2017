This appeal  challenges the\n                                  \n\ndistrict court's  dismissal  of plaintiff's  constitutional  tort\n\nclaims  against the  United  States, the  Commonwealth of  Puerto\n\nRico, officers  of both  governments, and the  National Insurance\n\nCrime Bureau (NICB) as time-barred.  We affirm.\n\n     The claims  arose from a  seizure of allegedly  stolen motor\n\nvehicles from plaintiff's  car dealership by  agents of the  FBI,\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and  the NICB.  The seizure took\n\nplace  sometime in  November,  1988.   A complaint,  subsequently\n\namended, was  filed on November 1,  1990.  All agree  that a one-\n\nyear statute  of limitations  applies to  all claims.   Plaintiff\n\nraised  the possible  tolling  of the  limitations period  in his\n\nopposition  to a  motion to  dismiss.   He cited  a June  5, 1989\n\nletter  from  his  attorney to  the  FBI  seeking  return of  the\n\nvehicles   and   subsequent  undescribed   conversations  between\n\nplaintiff or his attorney and the FBI.\n\n     The  district  court announced  early  in  its opinion  that\n\nsufficient  discovery  time  had  been allowed  and  that,  where\n\nappropriate,  it would  take cognizance  of documents  beyond the\n\npleadings.    It   subsequently  granted  summary   judgment  for\n\ndefendants  on plaintiff's cause of action  seeking return of the\n\nvehicles.   In dealing with  plaintiff's Bivens claim against the\n                                               \n\nUnited  States and an FBI agent, Maldonado, and with claims under\n\n42 U.S.C.    1983 against  the Commonwealth and  NICB, the  court\n\nfirst  concluded  that the  June 5,  1989  letter had  tolled the\n\nrunning  of the limitations period, but then ruled that more than\n\na  year  had  passed between  that  date and  the  filing  of the\n\ncomplaint.    It  refused  to   take  account  of  assertions  in\n\nplaintiff's opposition  to the motion  to dismiss that  there had\n\nbeen subsequent conversations between plaintiff and the FBI.  The\n\ncourt dismissed the claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n     We shall confine our  discussion to the dismissal of  claims\n\nagainst  FBI  agent Maldonado.    If that  dismissal  was proper,\n\ndismissal of the more  vulnerable claims against the Commonwealth\n\nand NICB must have been correct.\n\n     We first address whether, in light of Maldonado's failure to\n\nraise the statute of limitations  defense, the district court sua\n                                                                 \n\nsponte  could dismiss the claim as  time-barred.  Appellant cites\n      \n\nBadway v.  United States,  367 F.2d  22, 25  (1st Cir. 1966),  in\n                        \n\nwhich  we  held that  a limitations  defense  not raised  \"in the\n\npleadings\"  was  waived.     But  not  only  is  such   a  waiver\n\ninapplicable to the power of the court to dismiss a  claim on its\n\nown motion, see Leonhard v. United States, 633 F.2d 599, 609 n.11\n                                         \n\n(2d Cir. 1980), but the mandate of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c) requiring\n\naffirmative  defenses to  be set forth  in a  responsive pleading\n\ndoes not  apply to a motion to dismiss.   Compare Fed. R. Civ. P.\n                                                 \n\n7(a) and 7(b);  see also Serrano v. Torres, 764  F.2d 47, 49 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1985). \n\n     Appellant  also argues  that the  district court  improperly\n\ndismissed his complaint without  permitting him an opportunity to\n\nflesh out  his allegations  concerning tolling.   The allegations\n\nreferred  not  only  to the  June  5,  1989  letter but  also  to\n\n                               -3-\n\nsubsequent  conversations between plaintiff (and also plaintiff's\n\nattorney) and the FBI \"fully  discussing the vehicles' return and\n\ndamages  compensation.\"    The  district court,  while  accepting\n\nwithout analysis  the tolling  effect of  the letter, refused  to\n\nconsider the  allegations regarding the  conversations since they\n\nwere  only  statements  and  arguments  of  counsel  in  a  legal\n\nmemorandum.\n\n     We do  not reach  the question whether  sufficient attention\n\nwas   paid  to   the   post-complaint   allegations  of   tolling\n\nconversations.   Rather,  we hold  that the  June 5,  1989 letter\n\nseeking return of  the vehicles could not  toll the Bivens and   \n                                                          \n\n1983 civil rights claims  for damages.  The letter,  addressed to\n\nthe FBI director  in Puerto Rico,  detailed the facts  concerning\n\nthe seizure of the vehicles and appellant's  cooperation with the\n\nFBI and concluded as follows:\n\n          I have  withheld any  federal court action  in the\n     expectancy that said cars are returned to my client, to\n     no avail.   Therefore, I am hereby requesting  from you\n     the  return  forthwith of  the  seized  vehicles to  my\n     client. \n\n     Our own precedents concerning the requirements under  Puerto\n\nRico  law for tolling through extrajudicial claims are clear.  As\n\nwe said  in Rodriguez  Narvaez v. Nazario,  895 F.2d 38,  43 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir.  1990), \"tolling is effective  with regard only to identical\n\ncauses of action.\"   Most  recently, in Riofrio  Anda v.  Ralston\n                                                                 \n\nPurina  Co., 959 F.2d 1149,  1154 (1st Cir.  1992), we emphasized\n           \n\nthat an extrajudicial claim must seek  the same relief ultimately\n\nsought  in a  federal suit  if that  claim is  to have  a tolling\n\n                               -4-\n\neffect.   In  so holding,  we reaffirmed  Hernandez Del  Valle v.\n                                                              \n\nSanta Aponte, 575 F.2d 321, 323-324 (1st Cir. 1978) (letters from\n            \n\nplaintiff  demanding   only  reinstatement  held   inadequate  to\n\nconstitute an extrajudicial claim  sufficient to toll the statute\n\nof  limitations for  a  suit for  damages).   Our  reasoning  and\n\nholding  in Del Valle were approvingly noted by the Supreme Court\n                     \n\nof Puerto  Rico in the similar case of Cintron v. Commonwealth of\n                                                                 \n\nPuerto  Rico, No.  CE-88-761, slip  op.,  translation, at  11 n.8\n            \n\n(Dec. 7, 1990).  See also Torres v. Superintendent of Police, 893\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 404, 407 (1st Cir. 1990); Fernandez v. Chardon, 681 F.2d 42,\n                                                   \n\n49 (1st Cir. 1982),  aff'd, Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462  U.S. 650\n                                                  \n\n(1983).\n\n     We  see nothing  in  recent jurisprudence  issuing from  the\n\nSupreme  Court  of  Puerto  Rico   that  casts  doubt  on   these\n\nprecedents.  In a recent case, Zambrana Maldonado v. Commonwealth\n                                                                 \n\nof Puerto  Rico, 92 JTS 12, slip  op. at 23 (Jan.  30, 1992), the\n               \n\ncourt  reiterated  standard  formulations  such   as  these  from\n\nAlbaladejo's  treatise  on  civil  law:     while  \"a  series  of\n\nintermediate possibilities\" exist between \"the mere reminder of a\n\ndebt  . .  .  and  the  pure act  of  demanding  it  inexorably,\"\n\ninterruption  of the  limitations period  requires that  \"more or\n\nless categorically  or urgently,  the decision to  obtain payment\n\n[must be] shown.\"\n\n     In Zambrana Maldonado, the claim held sufficient to toll set\n                          \n\nforth the  date, place,  events, damages suffered,  and expressed\n\n\"the unequivocal will  of Mr. Zambrana Maldonado to  exercise his\n\n                               -5-\n\nright to have the Government indemnify him for damages suffered.\"\n\nId.  at 35.  Such presents an  extrajudicial claim of far greater\n  \n\nspecificity and  relevance than the  mere request  for return  of\n\nvehicles contained in plaintiff's letter of June 5, 1989.\n\n     We therefore  conclude that the  one-year limitations period\n\nwas not tolled.  Dismissal was required as a matter of law.\n\n     Affirmed. \n             \n\n                               -6-\n",

This appeal  challenges the\n                                  \n\ndistrict court's  dismissal  of plaintiff's  constitutional  tort\n\nclaims  against the  United  States, the  Commonwealth of  Puerto\n\nRico, officers  of both  governments, and the  National Insurance\n\nCrime Bureau (NICB) as time-barred.  We affirm.\n\n     The claims  arose from a  seizure of allegedly  stolen motor\n\nvehicles from plaintiff's  car dealership by  agents of the  FBI,\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and  the NICB.  The seizure took\n\nplace  sometime in  November,  1988.   A complaint,  subsequently\n\namended, was  filed on November 1,  1990.  All agree  that a one-\n\nyear statute  of limitations  applies to  all claims.   Plaintiff\n\nraised  the possible  tolling  of the  limitations period  in his\n\nopposition  to a  motion to  dismiss.   He cited  a June  5, 1989\n\nletter  from  his  attorney to  the  FBI  seeking  return of  the\n\nvehicles   and   subsequent  undescribed   conversations  between\n\nplaintiff or his attorney and the FBI.\n\n     The  district  court announced  early  in  its opinion  that\n\nsufficient  discovery  time  had  been allowed  and  that,  where\n\nappropriate,  it would  take cognizance  of documents  beyond the\n\npleadings.

The allegations\n\nreferred  not  only  to the  June  5,  1989  letter but  also  to\n\n                               -3-\n\nsubsequent  conversations between plaintiff (and also plaintiff's\n\nattorney) and the FBI \"fully  discussing the vehicles' return and\n\ndamages  compensation.\"    The  district court,  while  accepting\n\nwithout analysis  the tolling  effect of  the letter, refused  to\n\nconsider the  allegations regarding the  conversations since they\n\nwere  only  statements  and  arguments  of  counsel  in  a  legal\n\nmemorandum.\n\n     We do  not reach  the question whether  sufficient attention\n\nwas   paid  to   the   post-complaint   allegations  of   tolling\n\nconversations.   Rather,  we hold  that the  June 5,  1989 letter\n\nseeking return of  the vehicles could not  toll the Bivens and   \n                                                          \n\n1983 civil rights claims  for damages.  The letter,  addressed to\n\nthe FBI director  in Puerto Rico,  detailed the facts  concerning\n\nthe seizure of the vehicles and appellant's  cooperation with the\n\nFBI and concluded as follows:\n\n          I have  withheld any  federal court action  in the\n     expectancy that said cars are returned to my client, to\n     no avail.   Therefore, I am hereby requesting  from you\n     the  return  forthwith of  the  seized  vehicles to  my\n     client. \n\n     Our own precedents concerning the requirements under  Puerto\n\nRico  law for tolling through extrajudicial claims are clear.
