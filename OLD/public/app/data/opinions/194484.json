In this appeal,  plaintiffs\n                              \n\nchallenge   the  district  court's   imposition  of  Rule  11\n\nsanctions  for  their  submission  of  a  motion  in  a  case\n\ndismissed by  the district court two years  earlier.  Finding\n\nerror solely in the  district court's imposition of sanctions\n\nupon the attorneys' law firm rather than upon the responsible\n\nattorneys, we affirm,  except that we impose the sanctions on\n\nthe attorneys themselves.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n               BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                               \n\n          Plaintiffs are twenty-five dissatisfied Puerto Rico\n\nfranchisees  of the  sandwich shop  chain known  as \"Subway.\"\n\nDefendants consist  of Doctor's  Associates, Inc.,  owner and\n\nfranchisor of the \"Subway\" chain, and several of its officers\n\nand directors.   On  September 14, 1988,  plaintiffs, through\n\nthe  law  firm of  Woods  &amp;  Woods,  commenced  suit  against\n\ndefendants in  United States District Court  for the District\n\nof Puerto Rico alleging  breach of contract, fraud and  other\n\nclaims arising out of their franchise agreements.  \n\n          All of plaintiffs' individual  franchise agreements\n\ncontain  clauses  requiring  that any  claim  or  controversy\n\narising out of the  contract or an alleged breach  thereof be\n\nsettled by  arbitration in  Bridgeport, Connecticut.   On the\n\nbasis  of  that  arbitration  provision,  defendants  filed a\n\nmotion  to  dismiss.     Responding,  plaintiffs   interposed\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n\"Plaintiffs' Motion in  Opposition of  Defendants' Motion  to\n\nDismiss\" (\"the first  motion\") dated February 7, 1989  with a\n\nsupporting  memorandum of  law signed  by attorney  Victor M.\n\nRodriguez Baez  of Woods &amp; Woods.   On May 17, 1989, agreeing\n\nwith  defendants'  argument  that  the  arbitration provision\n\ncontrolled, the district court  granted defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss. \n\n          Twenty-two months later, on March  26, 1991, having\n\nsought  neither reconsideration  nor an  appeal, and  with no\n\nintervening change in the relevant law, plaintiffs  submitted\n\na motion  to the district court  entitled \"Plaintiffs' Second\n\nRequest   for  Change   of  Venue   and  First   Request  for\n\nConsolidation  of  Arbitration   Proceedings\"  (\"the   second\n\nmotion\").  The  memorandum of  law in support  of the  second\n\nmotion  consisted  entirely of  argumentation from  the first\n\nmotion  except for (1)  occasional minor  grammatical changes\n\n(e.g., changing \"the contract  was\" to \"the contracts were\"),\n     \n\nand  (2)  an appended  argument  requesting consolidation  of\n\nplaintiffs' claims for arbitration  proceedings.  The  second\n\nmotion was  signed by  attorneys Harry E.  Woods and  Gerardo\n\nMariani of Woods &amp; Woods. \n\n          In  response,  defendants filed  a  motion opposing\n\nplaintiffs'  second  motion  and  seeking  Rule 11  sanctions\n\nagainst  plaintiffs' attorneys.    The district  court denied\n\nplaintiffs'  second  motion, and  imposed  Rule 11  sanctions\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ndirecting that Woods  &amp; Woods pay  part of defendants'  costs\n\nfor defending the second motion.1  \n\n          Plaintiffs  now   appeal,  arguing  that   (1)  the\n\nsanctions should  not have  been imposed, (2)  the sanctioned\n\namount was excessive,  and (3) sanctions may  be imposed only\n\nagainst   individual  attorneys,   not  against   law  firms.\n\nAlthough  we find  merit  in plaintiffs'  final argument,  we\n\naffirm the district court in all other respects.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Fed.  R. Civ. P. 112 requires that an attorney make\n\n                    \n\n1.  Defendants  submitted  a  verified time  sheet  detailing\n128.5  hours  of legal  work with  fees  of over  $14,000 for\ndefense of  the sanctioned motion.  Based  on this submittal,\nthe district court imposed sanctions of $7,500.  \n\n2.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 states in relevant part:\n\n     Every pleading, motion, and  other paper of a party\n     represented by  an attorney  shall be signed  by at\n     least one  attorney  of record  in  the  attorney's\n     individual  name .  .  . .    The signature  of  an\n     attorney or party constitutes a certificate by  the\n     signer  that  the  signer has  read  the  pleading,\n     motion  or other  paper; that  to the  best of  the\n     signer's knowledge, information, and  belief formed\n     after  reasonable inquiry  it is  well  grounded in\n     fact and  is warranted  by existing law  or a  good\n     faith  argument for the extension, modification, or\n     reversal  of  existing  law,  and that  it  is  not\n     interposed  for any  improper purpose,  such as  to\n     harass  or to  cause unnecessary delay  or needless\n     increase in the  cost of  litigation. . .  .  If  a\n     pleading,  motion, or  other  paper  is  signed  in\n     violation of  this rule, the court,  upon motion or\n     upon  its own  initiative,  shall  impose upon  the\n     person who signed it, a represented party, or both,\n     an appropriate sanction, which may include an order\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nreasonable inquiry to assure  that all pleadings, motions and\n\npapers filed  with  the court  are  factually  well-grounded,\n\nlegally tenable and not  interposed for any improper purpose.\n\nCooter  &amp; Gell v.

See also Maine Audubon,\n                                                            \n\n907  F.2d at 268 (explaining  that a party  appealing Rule 11\n\nsanctions  \"bears a  heavy burden  of demonstrating  that the\n\ntrial  judge  was clearly  not  justified  in entering  [the]\n\norder\") (quoting Anderson, 900 F.2d at 393).  \n                         \n\nA.  The Propriety of the Sanctions\n                                  \n\n          Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  district  court  used\n\nimproper criteria in deciding to impose sanctions, that their\n\nmotion did  not  warrant  Rule 11  sanctions,  and  that  the\n\nsanctions  order   should  be  overturned  as   an  abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.  We disagree.  \n\n          The district court  found that plaintiffs'  counsel\n\nfailed to  make an  objectively reasonable inquiry  to assure\n\nthat the second motion was  legally tenable.  Several factors\n\nsupport  this  finding:    the  district  court  had  already\n\ndismissed the case  in favor of arbitration  nearly two years\n\nprior  to the  second  motion; the  second  motion failed  to\n\nsuggest any basis for the court's jurisdiction to rule on the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nmotion in view of the dismissal;  the second motion consisted\n\nof  virtually verbatim argumentation  from the  first motion;\n                      \n\nand  plaintiffs  had failed  to  appeal  or move  for  timely\n\nreconsideration of the order dismissing the first motion.3\n\n          We find,  therefore, that the record amply supports\n\nthe district court's imposition of Rule 11 sanctions based on\n\nthe  plaintiffs' filing  of its  second motion,  and  we find\n\nplaintiffs' \"abuse of discretion\" claim without merit.4\n\n                    \n\n3.  Plaintiffs   also  argue   that   the  district   court's\nscrupulous  attention to  the second  motion and  its careful\nconsideration  of  the sanction  is  evidence  of the  second\nmotion's  merit.   Our review  of the  record shows  that the\ndistrict court did no  more or less than properly  detail all\nthe reasons why  the second motion was sanctioned.  Moreover,\nwe  are  very  reluctant  to   fashion  a  rule  which  would\ndiscourage  district courts from  thoroughly discussing their\nreasons for  imposing  sanctions, and  we reject  plaintiffs'\nsuggestion that we adopt such an approach.\n\n4.  Plaintiffs  offer two  additional  arguments  to  support\ntheir  appeal of the sanctions.   First, they  argue that the\ndistrict   court  improperly  sanctioned   them  for  conduct\noccurring throughout the proceeding, rather than imposing its\nRule  11 sanctions  with regard  to one  particular pleading,\nmotion or  paper.   The  district  court order  imposing  the\nsanctions  belies this  argument:  \"What  concerns us  in the\nlong  history of  this  case,  which  has  been  filled  with\nnumerous delaying  tactics by the plaintiffs,  is this latest\n                                                             \nattempt  to  delay   arbitration.\"     Mariani  v.   Doctor's\n                                                             \nAssociates,  Inc., No. 88-1630, slip op. at 2 (D.P.R. Feb. 2,\n                 \n1992)  (emphasis  supplied).    Thus,  we  find  unpersuasive\nplaintiffs'  assertion that  the  district  court  improperly\nsanctioned conduct occurring throughout the proceeding.\n     Second, plaintiffs argue that  in deciding to impose the\nsanctions, the district court improperly ignored pressures on\nthe law firm of Woods &amp; Woods which contributed to the filing\nof the second motion.  Specifically, they argue that attorney\nMariani  was  in  the  process  of being  considered  for  an\nappointment as  a federal administrative law  judge, and that\nattorney  Woods  had been  diagnosed  as  having a  cancerous\nlesion.    Though  they  had  ample  opportunity  to  do  so,\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nB.  The Amount of the Sanctions\n                               \n\n          Plaintiffs' next  argument  is that  the  sanctions\n\nwere excessive.  Rule 11 specifically states that appropriate\n\nsanctions \"may include  an order  to pay the  other party  or\n\nparties  the  amount  of  the  reasonable  expenses  incurred\n\nbecause of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper,\n\nincluding  a  reasonable  attorney's  fee.\"    Moreover,  the\n\ndistrict court has  wide discretion in fashioning  sanctions.\n\nSee, e.g., Cooter &amp;  Gell, 496 U.S. at 400;  Lancellotti, 909\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 20; Anderson, 900 F.2d at 394; Unanue-Casal 898 F.2d\n                                                    \n\nat 843; Kale, 861 F.2d at 756-58.  \n            \n\n          In its order imposing  the sanctions, the  district\n\ncourt  noted that  the total of  128.5 hours  that defendants\n\nspent responding to plaintiffs' second motion seemed \"a great\n\ndeal of  work to  oppose  one motion.\"   It  also noted  that\n\nbecause  the  case had  \"lain dormant  for  two years,  it is\n\nunderstandable that  costs  were high.\"    As a  result,  the\n\ndistrict court  awarded defendants  roughly half of  the fees\n\nincurred  in  defending the  motion.    Reviewing the  record\n\ncarefully, we find that  the sanction of $7,500 was  not only\n\n                    \n\nplaintiffs  never argued  to  the district  court that  these\nfactors contributed  to the filing of  the sanctioned papers.\nWe  have  repeatedly  warned   that  we  will  not  entertain\narguments made for the first time on appeal.  Federal Deposit\n                                                             \nIns.  Co. v. World University, Inc., No. 92-1389, slip op. at\n                                   \n5  (1st Cir.  Oct. 22, 1992).   We  do not  therefore address\nplaintiffs'  arguments  about  the  health  and  professional\nstatus of attorneys Mariani and Woods.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nwithin  the  district   court's  discretion   but  was   also\n\nreasonable.5\n\nC.

Rule  11\n\nsanctions may  be imposed only upon  individual attorneys who\n\nhave  signed sanctioned papers.   Pavelic &amp; Leflore v.

According to plaintiffs, a\nphone  call or  some informal  contact from  defendants would\nhave been  the appropriate  response to their  second motion.\nDubisky, however,  is inapposite.

On appeal,  the\nSeventh Circuit held that  the defendant, before embarking on\na  costly  defense,  had  a  duty  to   mitigate  damages  by\ncontacting the plaintiff to  inform him of the jurisdictional\ndefect.

In this appeal,  plaintiffs\n                              \n\nchallenge   the  district  court's   imposition  of  Rule  11\n\nsanctions  for  their  submission  of  a  motion  in  a  case\n\ndismissed by  the district court two years  earlier.  Finding\n\nerror solely in the  district court's imposition of sanctions\n\nupon the attorneys' law firm rather than upon the responsible\n\nattorneys, we affirm,  except that we impose the sanctions on\n\nthe attorneys themselves.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n               BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                               \n\n          Plaintiffs are twenty-five dissatisfied Puerto Rico\n\nfranchisees  of the  sandwich shop  chain known  as \"Subway.\"\n\nDefendants consist  of Doctor's  Associates, Inc.,  owner and\n\nfranchisor of the \"Subway\" chain, and several of its officers\n\nand directors.   On  September 14, 1988,  plaintiffs, through\n\nthe  law  firm of  Woods  &amp;  Woods,  commenced  suit  against\n\ndefendants in  United States District Court  for the District\n\nof Puerto Rico alleging  breach of contract, fraud and  other\n\nclaims arising out of their franchise agreements.  \n\n          All of plaintiffs' individual  franchise agreements\n\ncontain  clauses  requiring  that any  claim  or  controversy\n\narising out of the  contract or an alleged breach  thereof be\n\nsettled by  arbitration in  Bridgeport, Connecticut.   On the\n\nbasis  of  that  arbitration  provision,  defendants  filed a\n\nmotion  to  dismiss.     Responding,  plaintiffs   interposed\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n\"Plaintiffs' Motion in  Opposition of  Defendants' Motion  to\n\nDismiss\" (\"the first  motion\") dated February 7, 1989  with a\n\nsupporting  memorandum of  law signed  by attorney  Victor M.\n\nRodriguez Baez  of Woods &amp; Woods.   On May 17, 1989, agreeing\n\nwith  defendants'  argument  that  the  arbitration provision\n\ncontrolled, the district court  granted defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss. \n\n          Twenty-two months later, on March  26, 1991, having\n\nsought  neither reconsideration  nor an  appeal, and  with no\n\nintervening change in the relevant law, plaintiffs  submitted\n\na motion  to the district court  entitled \"Plaintiffs' Second\n\nRequest   for  Change   of  Venue   and  First   Request  for\n\nConsolidation  of  Arbitration   Proceedings\"  (\"the   second\n\nmotion\").  The  memorandum of  law in support  of the  second\n\nmotion  consisted  entirely of  argumentation from  the first\n\nmotion  except for (1)  occasional minor  grammatical changes\n\n(e.g., changing \"the contract  was\" to \"the contracts were\"),\n     \n\nand  (2)  an appended  argument  requesting consolidation  of\n\nplaintiffs' claims for arbitration  proceedings.  The  second\n\nmotion was  signed by  attorneys Harry E.  Woods and  Gerardo\n\nMariani of Woods &amp; Woods. \n\n          In  response,  defendants filed  a  motion opposing\n\nplaintiffs'  second  motion  and  seeking  Rule 11  sanctions\n\nagainst  plaintiffs' attorneys.    The district  court denied\n\nplaintiffs'  second  motion, and  imposed  Rule 11  sanctions\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ndirecting that Woods  &amp; Woods pay  part of defendants'  costs\n\nfor defending the second motion.1  \n\n          Plaintiffs  now   appeal,  arguing  that   (1)  the\n\nsanctions should  not have  been imposed, (2)  the sanctioned\n\namount was excessive,  and (3) sanctions may  be imposed only\n\nagainst   individual  attorneys,   not  against   law  firms.\n\nAlthough  we find  merit  in plaintiffs'  final argument,  we\n\naffirm the district court in all other respects.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Fed.

Based  on this submittal,\nthe district court imposed sanctions of $7,500.  \n\n2.  Fed. R. Civ.

The Propriety of the Sanctions\n                                  \n\n          Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  district  court  used\n\nimproper criteria in deciding to impose sanctions, that their\n\nmotion did  not  warrant  Rule 11  sanctions,  and  that  the\n\nsanctions  order   should  be  overturned  as   an  abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.  We disagree.  \n\n          The district court  found that plaintiffs'  counsel\n\nfailed to  make an  objectively reasonable inquiry  to assure\n\nthat the second motion was  legally tenable.  Several factors\n\nsupport  this  finding:    the  district  court  had  already\n\ndismissed the case  in favor of arbitration  nearly two years\n\nprior  to the  second  motion; the  second  motion failed  to\n\nsuggest any basis for the court's jurisdiction to rule on the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nmotion in view of the dismissal;  the second motion consisted\n\nof  virtually verbatim argumentation  from the  first motion;\n                      \n\nand  plaintiffs  had failed  to  appeal  or move  for  timely\n\nreconsideration of the order dismissing the first motion.3\n\n          We find,  therefore, that the record amply supports\n\nthe district court's imposition of Rule 11 sanctions based on\n\nthe  plaintiffs' filing  of its  second motion,  and  we find\n\nplaintiffs' \"abuse of discretion\" claim without merit.4\n\n                    \n\n3.  Plaintiffs   also  argue   that   the  district   court's\nscrupulous  attention to  the second  motion and  its careful\nconsideration  of  the sanction  is  evidence  of the  second\nmotion's  merit.   Our review  of the  record shows  that the\ndistrict court did no  more or less than properly  detail all\nthe reasons why  the second motion was sanctioned.  Moreover,\nwe  are  very  reluctant  to   fashion  a  rule  which  would\ndiscourage  district courts from  thoroughly discussing their\nreasons for  imposing  sanctions, and  we reject  plaintiffs'\nsuggestion that we adopt such an approach.\n\n4.  Plaintiffs  offer two  additional  arguments  to  support\ntheir  appeal of the sanctions.   First, they  argue that the\ndistrict   court  improperly  sanctioned   them  for  conduct\noccurring throughout the proceeding, rather than imposing its\nRule  11 sanctions  with regard  to one  particular pleading,\nmotion or  paper.   The  district  court order  imposing  the\nsanctions  belies this  argument:  \"What  concerns us  in the\nlong  history of  this  case,  which  has  been  filled  with\nnumerous delaying  tactics by the plaintiffs,  is this latest\n                                                             \nattempt  to  delay   arbitration.\"     Mariani  v.

Thus,  we  find  unpersuasive\nplaintiffs'  assertion that  the  district  court  improperly\nsanctioned conduct occurring throughout the proceeding.\n     Second, plaintiffs argue that  in deciding to impose the\nsanctions, the district court improperly ignored pressures on\nthe law firm of Woods &amp; Woods which contributed to the filing\nof the second motion.  Specifically, they argue that attorney\nMariani  was  in  the  process  of being  considered  for  an\nappointment as  a federal administrative law  judge, and that\nattorney  Woods  had been  diagnosed  as  having a  cancerous\nlesion.    Though  they  had  ample  opportunity  to  do  so,\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nB.  The Amount of the Sanctions\n                               \n\n          Plaintiffs' next  argument  is that  the  sanctions\n\nwere excessive.  Rule 11 specifically states that appropriate\n\nsanctions \"may include  an order  to pay the  other party  or\n\nparties  the  amount  of  the  reasonable  expenses  incurred\n\nbecause of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper,\n\nincluding  a  reasonable  attorney's  fee.\"    Moreover,  the\n\ndistrict court has  wide discretion in fashioning  sanctions.\n\nSee, e.g., Cooter &amp;  Gell, 496 U.S. at 400;  Lancellotti, 909\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 20; Anderson, 900 F.2d at 394; Unanue-Casal 898 F.2d\n                                                    \n\nat 843; Kale, 861 F.2d at 756-58.  \n            \n\n          In its order imposing  the sanctions, the  district\n\ncourt  noted that  the total of  128.5 hours  that defendants\n\nspent responding to plaintiffs' second motion seemed \"a great\n\ndeal of  work to  oppose  one motion.\"   It  also noted  that\n\nbecause  the  case had  \"lain dormant  for  two years,  it is\n\nunderstandable that  costs  were high.\"    As a  result,  the\n\ndistrict court  awarded defendants  roughly half of  the fees\n\nincurred  in  defending the  motion.    Reviewing the  record\n\ncarefully, we find that  the sanction of $7,500 was  not only\n\n                    \n\nplaintiffs  never argued  to  the district  court that  these\nfactors contributed  to the filing of  the sanctioned papers.\nWe  have  repeatedly  warned   that  we  will  not  entertain\narguments made for the first time on appeal.  Federal Deposit\n                                                             \nIns.  Co. v. World University, Inc., No. 92-1389, slip op. at\n                                   \n5  (1st Cir.  Oct. 22, 1992).   We  do not  therefore address\nplaintiffs'  arguments  about  the  health  and  professional\nstatus of attorneys Mariani and Woods.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nwithin  the  district   court's  discretion   but  was   also\n\nreasonable.5\n\nC. Imposition of the Sanctions on the Individual Attorneys\n                                                          \n\n          Lastly, plaintiffs  argue,  and defendants  do  not\n\ndispute, that  the district court improperly  imposed Rule 11\n\nsanctions upon  the  law firm  of  Woods &amp;  Woods.   Rule  11\n\nsanctions may  be imposed only upon  individual attorneys who\n\nhave  signed sanctioned papers.   Pavelic &amp; Leflore v. Marvel\n                                                             \n\nEntertainment Group, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

According to plaintiffs, a\nphone  call or  some informal  contact from  defendants would\nhave been  the appropriate  response to their  second motion.\nDubisky, however,  is inapposite.  The  plaintiffs in Dubisky\n                                                             \nwere  mistaken  as  to defendant's  citizenship,  and wrongly\nbelieved  that  they  could  invoke  diversity  jurisdiction.\nPlaintiffs were  sanctioned under  Rule 11.
