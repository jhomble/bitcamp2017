Heru Kurniawan,1 a native and citizen of\n\nIndonesia, petitions for review of a decision by the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the Immigration Judge's denial\n\nof his application for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1231(b)(3).2    He claims that when he lived in Indonesia, he was\n\nsubject to harassment by members of his family because he converted\n\nfrom Islam to Christianity.    Kurniawan claims that the harassment\n\nwill continue if he returns to Indonesia.\n\n            In order to qualify for withholding of removal, \"an alien\n\nmust show, by a clear probability, that [he] will be persecuted\n\nbased on a protected ground if [he] is returned to [his] native\n\ncountry.\"    Ly v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 126, 132 (1st Cir. 2008).   The\n\napplicant must also show that the persecution is \"the direct result\n\nof government action, government-supported action, or government's\n\nunwillingness or inability to control private conduct.\"          Id.\n\n(quoting Kho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2007)).         A\n\n\n\n     1\n       His given name is Rifai Andreas Tumangka; however, he has\nadopted the name Heru Kurniawan in the United States. Kurniawan's\nwife, Patty Diane Deetje, and their adult sons, Defri Steven and\nWelson Agustinus, filed derivative applications for relief from\ndeportation based on Kurniawan's application. Their claims rest on\nKurniawan's and we therefore do not independently address them.\n     2\n        Petitioner also seeks review of the BIA's denial of his\npetition for relief under the United Nations Convention Against\nTorture. However, he waived this claim by failing to meaningfully\nraise it before the BIA.  Molina De Massenet v. Gonzales, 485 F.3d\n661, 664 (1st Cir. 2007) (explaining that arguments not raised\nbefore the BIA are waived due to a failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies).\n\n                                 -2-\n\fshowing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption\n\nof future persecution.        8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i);          Ruiz v.\n\nMukasey, 526 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           Before     the   Immigration   Judge   (IJ),   the    petitioner\n\ntestified that he converted from Islam to Christianity in 1984.\n\nSince that conversion, he and his wife have received threats from\n\nhis   parents   and   his   father's   family.    These   family    members\n\nthreatened to take his children away from him and his wife if he\n\ndid not revert to Islam and raise his sons as Muslims.             Although\n\nthe IJ acknowledged that \"harassment from one's family is ugly,\n\ndiscriminatory, and regrettable,\" the IJ concluded that he could\n\nnot \"find the harassment of the quality and degree experienced by\n\nthe petitioners\" supported a finding of persecution.            This finding\n\ndeprived the petitioner of a rebuttable presumption of future\n\npersecution.    Ruiz, 526 F.3d at 35.\n\n           As the IJ properly noted, \"[a]n applicant who has not\n\nsuffered past persecution may demonstrate that his life or freedom\n\nwould be threatened in a country on account of a protected ground\"\n\nand thereby qualify for withholding of removal.3          See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n\n      3\n       The IJ rejected the petitioner's application for asylum\nbecause the application was filed after the one-year filing\ndeadline.   The IJ found that the petitioner did not raise any\nextraordinary or changed circumstances that would justify ignoring\nthe requirement that aliens file an asylum application within one\nyear of arriving in the United States. Jorgji v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d\n53, 55 (1st Cir. 2008). The petitioner does not challenge that\ndetermination on appeal.    In any event, we would not have the\njurisdiction to entertain such a challenge. Ly, 524 F.3d at 130.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f1208.16(b)(2).          However, the IJ explained that the petitioner had\n\nfailed to make such a showing. The petitioner provided no evidence\n\nof   anyone        outside      of     his    family         engaging   in    harassing    or\n\nthreatening behavior.                The IJ further found that \"there is no\n\nevidence         that     the    government             of    Indonesia      tolerates    the\n\ndiscrimination [against Christians] in that country such as to be\n\nfound as government directed or condoned so as to be tantamount to\n\npersecution.\"             In support of this conclusion, the IJ cited the\n\n2005 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Indonesia, which\n\nrefers to occasional incidences of violence against Christians, but\n\ndoes       not    indicate      that    the       government      either      condones    the\n\nreligiously motivated violence or is unable to control it.\n\n                 The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision, adopting its factual\n\nfindings.4        In seeking review, the petitioner challenges only the\n\nIJ's and BIA's conclusion that he fails to meet his burden of\n\nproving that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted\n\nif he returns to Indonesia.                   He argues that the persecution he\n\nsuffered in Indonesia, in conjunction with the 2005 Country Report\n\non   Human       Rights    Practices         in    Indonesia,      constitutes     evidence\n\nsufficient to satisfy his burden.                       However, nothing in the record\n\nor in his woefully inadequate brief compels a contrary finding.\n\nJamal v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir. 2008) (explaining that\n\n\n       4\n       We review both the IJ's and BIA's decisions when the BIA\nadopts and affirms the IJ's decision and adds its own analysis.\nLy, 524 F.3d at 130.\n\n                                                  -4-\n\fa petitioner \"must demonstrate the evidence in the record not only\n\nsupports a contrary conclusion but compels it\").\n\n          Therefore, we deny the petition for review.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
