(hereinafter:\n\n\"Electronica\" or  \"chapter  11  debtor\"),  appeals  the  district\n\ncourt's  reversal of a bankruptcy court order according \"adminis-\n\ntrative  expense\" priority to certain alimony and support obliga-\n\ntions due Capo by her former husband, Reinaldo Betancourt Veraits\n\n(\"Betancourt\").  We affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Capo filed  for divorce  from Betancourt  in 1987.   At\n\nthat time, Betancourt was the  president and sole shareholder  of\n\nElectronica, and Capo served as its unsalaried vice-president and\n\ngeneral   manager.    On  July 22,  1988,  Betancourt,  Capo  and\n\nElectronica entered  into an  unusual agreement  (\"Support Agree-\n\nment\")  whereby  Electronica  assumed  joint  liability  for  the\n\nalimony and support payments Betancourt would be required to make\n\nto Capo under their divorce decree.  As consideration for Electr-\n\nonica's assumption of liability under the Support Agreement, Capo\n\nagreed to resign her positions with Electronica.1\n\n                    \n\n     1The bankruptcy court  found that the Support  Agreement was\n\"entered into  in arms-length negotiations, . . .\"  and \"executed\nwith [a] clear and avowed  corporate purpose . . . to sever[] all\ncorporate  and managerial connections  of Mrs. Capo  with debtor,\nthus  avoiding the  tense situations  that  could possibly  arise\n                                                                 \nafter the divorce of the sole stockholder of the company from his\nwife  and  corporate officer  [sic]  and General  Manager  of the\ncompany for many years.\"  (Emphasis  added.)  As we affirm on  an\nalternate ground relied  upon by the district court,  we need not\n\n                                2\n\n          On June 28, 1989, Electronica filed a voluntary chapter\n\n11  petition  and  discontinued its  payments  under  the Support\n\nAgreement.2    Approximately a  year  later, in  June  1990, Capo\n\nrequested  that accrued alimony and support obligations under the\n\nSupport Agreement be allowed as priority  \"administrative expens-\n\nes\" of the chapter 11 estate.  See Bankruptcy Code    503(a),(b)-\n                                  \n\n(1)(A);  11 U.S.C.    503(a),(b)(1)(A).  Electronica  opposed the\n\nrequest.\n\n          On November 29, 1990, the  bankruptcy court confirmed a\n\nchapter 11 reorganization  plan which provided, inter  alia, that\n                                                           \n\n\"[a]ny  executory  contract  not  specifically  rejected  on  the\n\nconfirmation of  the Plan  shall be deemed  assumed.\"   The court\n\ncontemporaneously  allowed  Capo's  request  to  recover  accrued\n\nsupport  and alimony  payments under  the Support Agreement.   It\n\nruled that the  Support Agreement, as  an executory contract  not\n\npreviously rejected, was  assumed in accordance with  the express\n\nterms of the reorganization plan.  Based on its finding that  the\n\nSupport Agreement provided a continuing benefit to \"the operation\n\nof the corporation . . . [by] avoiding internal struggles between\n\ntwo  competing  officers[,]  which could  be  detrimental  to the\n\n[debtor's continued] operation,\"  the bankruptcy court  concluded\n\nthat the accrued support and alimony payments were \"necessary for\n\n                    \n\ndetermine whether Capo's resignation  constituted valid consider-\nation for  Electronica's assumption  of Betancourt's  obligations\nunder the Support Agreement.  \n\n     2The  record does not  indicate whether Betancourt continued\nto make payments under the divorce decree.  \n\n                                3\n\n[the] preservation\" of  the chapter 11 estate,  hence entitled to\n\npriority treatment  as costs  of administration  under Bankruptcy\n\nCode   503(b)(1)(A).   Electronica appealed.  The  district court\n\nreversed  on the  ground that  the Support  Agreement was  not an\n\nexecutory  contract and, alternatively,  that the marital support\n\nand alimony payments  due Capo under  the Support Agreement  were\n\nnot  \"actual,  necessary  costs and  expenses  of  preserving the\n\nestate,\" within the meaning of Bankruptcy Code   503(b)(1)(A).\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n\"Administrative Expense\" Priority\n                                 \n\n          In the  circumstances of the present case,  we need not\n\nconcern  ourselves  with  whether the  Support  Agreement  was an\n\n\"executory contract,\"3 or whether Capo's prepetition  resignation\n\n                    \n\n     3Subject to  certain exceptions  not presently  relevant, an\nexecutory contract or unexpired lease may be  assumed or rejected\npursuant  to a confirmed chapter 11 plan.   See 11 U.S.C.    365,\n                                               \n1123(b).  Although  the Bankruptcy Code does not  define the term\n\"executory  contract,\" most courts adopt the position advanced by\nProfessor Vern  Countryman, defining  an \"executory  contract\" as\none \"under  which the obligation  [of] both the bankrupt  and the\nother  party to  the contract  are  so far  unperformed that  the\nfailure  of either  to complete  performance  would constitute  a\nmaterial breach excusing the performance  of the other.\"  Vern A.\nCountryman, Executory Contracts in Bankruptcy, Pt. I, 57 Minn. L.\n                                                    \nRev. 439, 460 (1973).  A few courts, treating Professor Countrym-\nan's definition as \"helpful  but not controlling,\" hold that  the\ndetermination whether a  contract is \"executory\" requires  a more\n\"functional\"  approach,  \"with  an  eye  towards  furthering  the\npolicies  of the  Bankruptcy Code.\"    See In  re Richmond  Metal\n                                                                 \nFinishers, Inc., 34 B.R. 521  (Bkrtcy.

Even assuming\n\nsufficient consideration for the Support  Agreement, Capo utterly\n\nfailed to carry her burden of proof on the subsidiary proposition\n\nthat  the  chapter  11 debtor's  postpetition  assumption  of its\n\npresident's  financial  obligations   under  the  divorce  decree\n\nconstituted  an \"actual, necessary  cost[] and expense[]  of pre-\n\nserving the  [chapter 11] estate,\" within the  meaning of section\n                        \n\n503(b)(1)(A); see also In re  Hemingway Transport, Inc., 954 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1,  5 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (\"the  burden of  proving entitlement  to\n\npriority payment  as an administrative  expense . . .  rests with\n\nthe party  requesting it\"); In  re CIS  Corp., 142 B.R.  640, 642\n                                             \n\n(S.D.N.Y.  1992) (  503(b)(1)(A)  claimant has burden  of proving\n\nthat its services provided an \"actual,  necessary\" benefit to the\n\ndebtor).            As we have  long recognized, \"the traditional\n\npresumption favoring  ratable distribution  among all  holders of\n\nunsecured claims counsels  strict construction of the  Bankruptcy\n\nCode  provisions  governing  requests  for  priority  payment  of\n\nadministrative  expenses.\"   Hemingway Trans.,  954  F.2d at  4-5\n                                             \n\n(citing cases).

At\n\nthat time, Betancourt was the  president and sole shareholder  of\n\nElectronica, and Capo served as its unsalaried vice-president and\n\ngeneral   manager.    On  July 22,  1988,  Betancourt,  Capo  and\n\nElectronica entered  into an  unusual agreement  (\"Support Agree-\n\nment\")  whereby  Electronica  assumed  joint  liability  for  the\n\nalimony and support payments Betancourt would be required to make\n\nto Capo under their divorce decree.  As consideration for Electr-\n\nonica's assumption of liability under the Support Agreement, Capo\n\nagreed to resign her positions with Electronica.1\n\n                    \n\n     1The bankruptcy court  found that the Support  Agreement was\n\"entered into  in arms-length negotiations, . . .\"  and \"executed\nwith [a] clear and avowed  corporate purpose . . . to sever[] all\ncorporate  and managerial connections  of Mrs. Capo  with debtor,\nthus  avoiding the  tense situations  that  could possibly  arise\n                                                                 \nafter the divorce of the sole stockholder of the company from his\nwife  and  corporate officer  [sic]  and General  Manager  of the\ncompany for many years.\"  (Emphasis  added.)  As we affirm on  an\nalternate ground relied  upon by the district court,  we need not\n\n                                2\n\n          On June 28, 1989, Electronica filed a voluntary chapter\n\n11  petition  and  discontinued its  payments  under  the Support\n\nAgreement.2    Approximately a  year  later, in  June  1990, Capo\n\nrequested  that accrued alimony and support obligations under the\n\nSupport Agreement be allowed as priority  \"administrative expens-\n\nes\" of the chapter 11 estate.  See Bankruptcy Code    503(a),(b)-\n                                  \n\n(1)(A);  11 U.S.C.    503(a),(b)(1)(A).  Electronica  opposed the\n\nrequest.\n\n          On November 29, 1990, the  bankruptcy court confirmed a\n\nchapter 11 reorganization  plan which provided, inter  alia, that\n                                                           \n\n\"[a]ny  executory  contract  not  specifically  rejected  on  the\n\nconfirmation of  the Plan  shall be deemed  assumed.\"   The court\n\ncontemporaneously  allowed  Capo's  request  to  recover  accrued\n\nsupport  and alimony  payments under  the Support Agreement.   It\n\nruled that the  Support Agreement, as  an executory contract  not\n\npreviously rejected, was  assumed in accordance with  the express\n\nterms of the reorganization plan.  Based on its finding that  the\n\nSupport Agreement provided a continuing benefit to \"the operation\n\nof the corporation . . . [by] avoiding internal struggles between\n\ntwo  competing  officers[,]  which could  be  detrimental  to the\n\n[debtor's continued] operation,\"  the bankruptcy court  concluded\n\nthat the accrued support and alimony payments were \"necessary for\n\n                    \n\ndetermine whether Capo's resignation  constituted valid consider-\nation for  Electronica's assumption  of Betancourt's  obligations\nunder the Support Agreement.  \n\n     2The  record does not  indicate whether Betancourt continued\nto make payments under the divorce decree.  \n\n                                3\n\n[the] preservation\" of  the chapter 11 estate,  hence entitled to\n\npriority treatment  as costs  of administration  under Bankruptcy\n\nCode   503(b)(1)(A).   Electronica appealed.  The  district court\n\nreversed  on the  ground that  the Support  Agreement was  not an\n\nexecutory  contract and, alternatively,  that the marital support\n\nand alimony payments  due Capo under  the Support Agreement  were\n\nnot  \"actual,  necessary  costs and  expenses  of  preserving the\n\nestate,\" within the meaning of Bankruptcy Code   503(b)(1)(A).\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n\"Administrative Expense\" Priority\n                                 \n\n          In the  circumstances of the present case,  we need not\n\nconcern  ourselves  with  whether the  Support  Agreement  was an\n\n\"executory contract,\"3 or whether Capo's prepetition  resignation\n\n                    \n\n     3Subject to  certain exceptions  not presently  relevant, an\nexecutory contract or unexpired lease may be  assumed or rejected\npursuant  to a confirmed chapter 11 plan.   See 11 U.S.C.    365,\n                                               \n1123(b).  Although  the Bankruptcy Code does not  define the term\n\"executory  contract,\" most courts adopt the position advanced by\nProfessor Vern  Countryman, defining  an \"executory  contract\" as\none \"under  which the obligation  [of] both the bankrupt  and the\nother  party to  the contract  are  so far  unperformed that  the\nfailure  of either  to complete  performance  would constitute  a\nmaterial breach excusing the performance  of the other.\"  Vern A.\nCountryman, Executory Contracts in Bankruptcy, Pt.

A few courts, treating Professor Countrym-\nan's definition as \"helpful  but not controlling,\" hold that  the\ndetermination whether a  contract is \"executory\" requires  a more\n\"functional\"  approach,  \"with  an  eye  towards  furthering  the\npolicies  of the  Bankruptcy Code.\"    See In  re Richmond  Metal\n                                                                 \nFinishers, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1861670\"><a href=\"/opinion/1861670/in-re-richmond-metal-finishers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (Bkrtcy.
