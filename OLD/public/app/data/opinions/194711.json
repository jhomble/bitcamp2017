Defendant  Julio  Cesar Padin\n                            \n\nTorres  (\"Padin\")  pleaded  guilty  to  three  counts  of  an\n\nindictment  for  offenses  related  to  his  operation  of  a\n\nmortgage lending institution.   Padin was sentenced to prison\n\nand ordered to pay $825,000 in restitution to the government.\n\nHe now appeals, challenging these sanctions.  For the reasons\n\nthat follow,  we modify  the restitution order  and otherwise\n\naffirm. \n\n     Padin  was charged in  a thirteen-count  indictment with\n\nconversion of federal funds,  mail fraud, submission of false\n\nstatements,  and obstruction of  justice.  18  U.S.C.    641,\n\n1341,  1001, 1515.  The charges grew out of Padin's operation\n\nof Prudential Mortgage Corporation (\"Prudential\"), a mortgage\n\nlender participating as an  \"issuer\" of securities guaranteed\n\nby  the Government  National  Mortgage Association,  commonly\n\nknown  as  \"Ginnie   Mae.\"    In  addition  to  managing  the\n\ncorporation,  Padin was Prudential's  president and principal\n\nstockholder.  \n\n     In  accordance  with  its  agreement  with  Ginnie  Mae,\n\nPrudential was required to make monthly payments of principal\n\nand interest  to holders  of securities issued  by Prudential\n\nand guaranteed by Ginnie Mae.  Prudential was also  obligated\n\nto turn over to individual investors lump sum payments by the\n\nfederal government for defaulted government-insured mortgages\n\nissued  by  Prudential.   Beginning  in  1980 and  continuing\n\n                             -2-\n\nthrough 1987 Padin, in violation of the agreement with Ginnie\n\nMae, withheld  payment of  the lump sums  collected from  the\n\nfederal  government  on  defaulted  mortgages  and  owed   to\n\nindividual investors.   A portion  of the funds  was used  to\n\ncover  the  monthly dividends  owed  to  all of  Prudential's\n\nGinnie Mae  investors, with  the remainder being  diverted to\n\ncorporate and personal bank accounts.\n\n     Padin  masked  the   scheme  by   representing  to   the\n\ngovernment that the monies  paid for defaulted mortgages were\n\nbeing  passed onto  investors.   At  the  same time,  he  led\n\ninvestors to believe that the mortgages in default were still\n\nalive.   The  fraud came  to light  when Prudential  began to\n\ndefault  on the monthly dividends.  The resulting loss to the\n\ngovernment,   excluding   collateral  expenditures,   totaled\n\napproximately $11.5  million, the  amount paid out  to Ginnie\n\nMae insured investors to cover Prudential's default. \n\n     Padin  entered an initial  plea of not  guilty but later\n\nchanged his plea to guilty on one count each of conversion of\n\nfederal  funds,   mail  fraud,   and  the  filing   of  false\n\nstatements.  The remaining  counts were dismissed pursuant to\n\na plea agreement.  As required by Rule 11, the district court\n\nconducted a  change of plea  hearing.   Fed. R. Crim.  P. 11.\n\nBefore accepting his guilty  plea, the district court advised\n\nPadin, among other things,  that he was subject to  a maximum\n\ntotal fine  of $21,000--$1,000  on the  mail fraud count  and\n\n                             -3-\n\n$10,000 each  on the  conversion and false  statement counts.\n\nAt no time  during the  plea hearing did  the district  court\n\nmention that an order of restitution was also a possibility.\n\n     The  sentencing hearing which followed later was largely\n\nconsumed by  Padin's efforts  to establish  that much  of the\n\ndiverted funds were used to keep Prudential afloat and only a\n\nsmall  portion of the total  was diverted to Padin's personal\n\nuse.  The court then imposed sentence.  The sentence included\n\na 15-year  term of imprisonment and an order compelling Padin\n\nto  pay  $852,000 in  restitution  to the  government.   This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n     Padin first contends that the district court in imposing\n\nsentence relied on irrelevant  and mistaken information.  See\n                                                             \n\nUnited  States v.  Curran, 926  F.2d 59,  61 (1st  Cir. 1991)\n                         \n\n(defendant  has right  not to  be sentenced  on the  basis of\n\nfalse information).   Padin claims that  the court improperly\n\nconsidered   allegations  that  he   withheld  disclosure  of\n\naccounting ledgers subpoenaed by the government, and that the\n\namount of  losses claimed by the  government was unsupported.\n\n     A trial court  has very broad discretion to  decide what\n\ninformation  is relevant  for  sentencing  purposes.   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Geer, 923 F.2d 892, 897  (1st Cir. 1991).  The so-\n               \n\ncalled \"allegations\"--that important  ledgers were  missing--\n\nwere supported by the testimony of a government  auditor, who\n\nfurther stated  that the  government's audit was  hampered by\n\n                             -4-\n\nthe  lack of  access to  the documents.   Padin's  failure to\n\nproduce the requested ledgers  or plausibly account for their\n\nwhereabouts  was a  relevant  circumstance that  the district\n\ncourt could consider  in imposing sentence.   See Roberts  v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited States, 445 U.S. 552  (1980) (trial court may properly\n             \n\nconsider  as  a  sentencing  factor  defendant's  refusal  to\n\ncooperate with law enforcement officials).\n\n     As  to the amount of  government losses,   Padin did not\n\ndeny that the government had paid $11.5 million to Ginnie Mae\n\ninsured  investors to  cover  Prudential's default.   Rather,\n\nPadin claimed  that this  figure overstated the  loss to  the\n\ngovernment because, according  to Padin, he used  some of the\n\nconverted  federal  funds  to sustain  mortgages  that  would\n\notherwise have  fallen into default.   As the  district court\n\npointed  out, however,  the number  of would-be  defaults, if\n\nany, could  only be  determined by  reference to the  ledgers\n\nwhich Padin  failed to  provide.  Under  these circumstances,\n\nthe auditor's testimony as to the basic loss of $11.5 million\n\nwas  sufficient.   See United  States v.  Zuleta-Alvarez, 922\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 33, 36  (1st Cir.  1990), cert. denied,  111 S.Ct.  2039\n                                           \n\n(1991).    \n\n     Finally, Padin takes  exception to the district  judge's\n\nreliance on a  Sentencing Guidelines work sheet  that was not\n\ndisclosed  to   Padin  until  after   sentence  was  imposed.\n\nAlthough Padin's  offense was not governed  by the Sentencing\n\n                             -5-\n\nGuidelines, the district judge permissibly  looked to certain\n\nguidelines factors  in  determining Padin's  sentence.    See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Twomey, 845 F.2d 1132, 1135 (1st Cir. 1988).\n                       \n\nThe work  sheet reflects  that the district  judge determined\n\nthat Padin  had obstructed justice  and abused a  position of\n\ntrust, and that Padin  was given no credit for  acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.  The obstruction finding was based on Padin's\n\nwithholding of the financial ledgers.    \n\n     We  find no  error in  the district  court's use  of the\n\nundisclosed  work sheet.  To be sure, a defendant is entitled\n\nto  notice  of  factual  information  that  will  affect  his\n\nsentence as  well as  an opportunity  to respond,  see United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Hernandez, 896  F.2d 642, 644 (1st Cir.  1990), but\n                   \n\nPadin was afforded this  right.  While the work  sheet itself\n\nwas not disclosed prior to sentencing, Padin had ample notice\n\nof  the  underlying  negative  information  reflected in  the\n\ndocument.1      Additionally, the  parties were  advised well\n\nahead of  sentencing that  the district court  would consider\n\nthe  Sentencing  Guidelines in  imposing  sentence.   As  for\n\nacceptance of  responsibility, it is a  mitigating factor and\n\n                    \n\n     1The charge that  Padin impeded  justice by  withholding\naccounting ledgers was set forth as a count in the indictment\nand reiterated  in the pre-sentence report  released to Padin\nin  advance  of sentencing.    The  pre-sentence report  also\ncontained the  probation officer's assessment  that Padin had\nabused a position of trust.\n\n                             -6-\n\nit was  up to Padin's  counsel to  raise the  issue with  the\n\ndistrict court if Padin hoped to obtain credit on this score.\n\n     In addition to attacking his  sentence as a whole, Padin\n\nchallenges  the restitution  order on  several grounds.   The\n\nprincipal  ground  is  that  the district  court,  in  taking\n\nPadin's  guilty  plea, neglected  to  first  inform him  that\n\nrestitution could be imposed  as part of his sentence.   Fed.\n\nR.  Crim. P. 11(c)(1) provides that in addition to much else,\n\nthe  court must tell  the defendant prior to  his plea of the\n\nmaximum penalties, including \"when applicable, that the court\n\nmay also  order  the defendant  to  make restitution  to  any\n\nvictim of  the offense.\"   The government concedes  that this\n\nwarning was not given.\n\n     This objection is  raised for the first  time on appeal.\n\nPadin's  counsel  asserts  that  he  was  caught  off  guard:\n\nrestitution  was  not  mentioned  until  the   judge  imposed\n\nsentence  at the  conclusion of  the sentencing  hearing, and\n\nfinal judgement was entered that same day.  The error is  not\n\ndisputed, and is apparent  on the face of the  record without\n\nfurther  findings.  Rule 11 objections, so far as they affect\n\nthe \"knowing\" character  of the plea, are  treated with extra\n\nsolicitude.  United States v. Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d 588, 593\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1991).   Under  all of the  circumstances, we  will\n\nconsider the issue under the \"plain error\" doctrine.\n\n                             -7-\n\n     The government says that  the error, even if  plain, was\n\nnot  prejudicial   because   Padin  must   have  known   that\n\nrestitution was an issue, given  the attention devoted to the\n\namount of  the government's  loss.   Most  of that  attention\n\noccurred  after the  plea  was taken.    More important,  the\n\namount of the loss  was clearly pertinent to the  severity of\n\nthe  prison term, so there was good reason for this attention\n\nregardless of restitution.  Cf. U.S.S.G.   2B1.1(b)(1)(1992).\n                              \n\nIf the government could show from the record that at the time\n\nof  his  plea  Padin actually  knew  that  restitution was  a\n\npossibility,  this would be a different case. It has not done\n\nso.\n\n     The more difficult problem  stems from the warning given\n\nto  Padin  before his  plea that  $21,000  in fines  might be\n\nimposed.  A  number of circuits  have held that a  warning of\n\nfines can render harmless the failure to warn of restitution,\n\nat  least so  long as  any payments  actually ordered  do not\n\nexceed the figure stated to the defendant at the time of  his\n\nplea.  E.g.,  United States  v. Fox, 941  F.2d 480 (7th  Cir.\n                                   \n\n1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1190 (1992); United States v.\n                                                          \n\nMiller,  900 F.2d  919,  921 (6th  Cir.  1990).   The  Second\n      \n\nCircuit  has  taken  the  opposite  view,  reasoning  that  a\n\ndefendant might  sometimes decide not  to plead guilty  if he\n\nknew  that restitution,  and  not just  a fine  of comparable\n\namount, was possible.  United States v. Khan, 857 F.2d 85 (2d\n                                            \n\n                             -8-\n\nCir. 1988), modified on  reh'g, 869 F.2d 661 (2d  Cir. 1989),\n                              \n\ncert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 682 (1991).\n            \n\n     In  our view,  whether  an omitted  Rule  11 warning  is\n\nprejudicial or harmless turns on the circumstances and we see\n\nno  reason to  lay down  a general  rule.   In this  case, no\n\nreason has been suggested  to us why Padin's choice  to plead\n\nwould  have been different if  he had been  told that $21,000\n\nmight be  imposed  as restitution,  rather  than as  a  fine.\n\nIndeed, usually restitution is the more attractive label from\n\nthe defendant's standpoint, since it reduces the  defendant's\n\ncivil liability  to the victim.   In this case, we  think the\n\nRule 11 violation,  although plain, was also  harmless to the\n\nextent of  $21,000 and  harmful  beyond that  amount.   Since\n\nPadin had  been told at  the plea  hearing that this  was the\n\nmaximum  fine on all three  counts, warning of  a much larger\n\namount could reasonably have  affected his decision to plead.\n\nThe  government now says that Padin was actually subject to a\n\nfine of $250,000 on each count, but no one claims that he was\n\nso advised at the time he pled.\n\n     The  question remains whether a remand is required.  The\n\ngovernment has made  plain in  its brief that  it prefers  to\n\nretain  the  guilty  plea even  at  the  cost  of losing  any\n\nrestitution.   This is an   understandable choice, especially\n\nbecause the  government may  still have an  independent civil\n\nclaim against  Padin for its losses.   At the same  time, the\n\n                             -9-\n\nchoice  of  sentence is  normally a  matter for  the district\n\ncourt.   In theory, had it known that the restitution ordered\n\nwas  unavailable, the  district  court could  have chosen  to\n\nimpose a longer prison sentence--the maximum was 20 years--or\n\neven  given  Padin  a  corrected  warning  as  to  sanctions,\n\nallowing him at the same time to  withdraw his guilty plea if\n\nhe chose.\n\n     In  this  case, we  think a  remand  would be  a useless\n\nformality.  The government  has made it clear that  annulling\n\nor reducing the restitution  ordered is its preferred outcome\n\nif the court finds prejudicial error.  We cannot imagine that\n\nthe district court would  increase the existing  fifteen-year\n\nsentence, let  alone reopen  the guilty plea,  simply because\n\nthe  amount   of  direct  restitution  is   reduced  and  the\n\ngovernment  remitted to a civil  suit.  Padin  himself has no\n\nbasis  for complaint since under  the modified judgment he is\n\nobliged to pay no  more than he was warned of at  the time of\n\nhis guilty plea.  \n\n     Padin's  brief contesting  his  sentence  contains  many\n\nseparate arguments,  some of  which overlap while  others are\n\nmooted  by  our  resolution.     We  have  addressed  Padin's\n\nprincipal  contentions  and  considered  the  others  without\n\nfinding further error.  The  judgment is modified by reducing\n                                                 \n\nthe  restitution   ordered  to  $21,000,   and  is  otherwise\n\naffirmed.\n        \n\n                             -10-\n",

Defendant  Julio  Cesar Padin\n                            \n\nTorres  (\"Padin\")  pleaded  guilty  to  three  counts  of  an\n\nindictment  for  offenses  related  to  his  operation  of  a\n\nmortgage lending institution.   Padin was sentenced to prison\n\nand ordered to pay $825,000 in restitution to the government.\n\nHe now appeals, challenging these sanctions.  For the reasons\n\nthat follow,  we modify  the restitution order  and otherwise\n\naffirm. \n\n     Padin  was charged in  a thirteen-count  indictment with\n\nconversion of federal funds,  mail fraud, submission of false\n\nstatements,  and obstruction of  justice.  18  U.S.C.    641,\n\n1341,  1001, 1515.  The charges grew out of Padin's operation\n\nof Prudential Mortgage Corporation (\"Prudential\"), a mortgage\n\nlender participating as an  \"issuer\" of securities guaranteed\n\nby  the Government  National  Mortgage Association,  commonly\n\nknown  as  \"Ginnie   Mae.\"    In  addition  to  managing  the\n\ncorporation,  Padin was Prudential's  president and principal\n\nstockholder.  \n\n     In  accordance  with  its  agreement  with  Ginnie  Mae,\n\nPrudential was required to make monthly payments of principal\n\nand interest  to holders  of securities issued  by Prudential\n\nand guaranteed by Ginnie Mae.  Prudential was also  obligated\n\nto turn over to individual investors lump sum payments by the\n\nfederal government for defaulted government-insured mortgages\n\nissued  by  Prudential.   Beginning  in  1980 and  continuing\n\n                             -2-\n\nthrough 1987 Padin, in violation of the agreement with Ginnie\n\nMae, withheld  payment of  the lump sums  collected from  the\n\nfederal  government  on  defaulted  mortgages  and  owed   to\n\nindividual investors.   A portion  of the funds  was used  to\n\ncover  the  monthly dividends  owed  to  all of  Prudential's\n\nGinnie Mae  investors, with  the remainder being  diverted to\n\ncorporate and personal bank accounts.\n\n     Padin  masked  the   scheme  by   representing  to   the\n\ngovernment that the monies  paid for defaulted mortgages were\n\nbeing  passed onto  investors.   At  the  same time,  he  led\n\ninvestors to believe that the mortgages in default were still\n\nalive.   The  fraud came  to light  when Prudential  began to\n\ndefault  on the monthly dividends.  The resulting loss to the\n\ngovernment,   excluding   collateral  expenditures,   totaled\n\napproximately $11.5  million, the  amount paid out  to Ginnie\n\nMae insured investors to cover Prudential's default. \n\n     Padin  entered an initial  plea of not  guilty but later\n\nchanged his plea to guilty on one count each of conversion of\n\nfederal  funds,   mail  fraud,   and  the  filing   of  false\n\nstatements.  The remaining  counts were dismissed pursuant to\n\na plea agreement.  As required by Rule 11, the district court\n\nconducted a  change of plea  hearing.   Fed. R. Crim.  P. 11.\n\nBefore accepting his guilty  plea, the district court advised\n\nPadin, among other things,  that he was subject to  a maximum\n\ntotal fine  of $21,000--$1,000  on the  mail fraud count  and\n\n                             -3-\n\n$10,000 each  on the  conversion and false  statement counts.\n\nAt no time  during the  plea hearing did  the district  court\n\nmention that an order of restitution was also a possibility.\n\n     The  sentencing hearing which followed later was largely\n\nconsumed by  Padin's efforts  to establish  that much  of the\n\ndiverted funds were used to keep Prudential afloat and only a\n\nsmall  portion of the total  was diverted to Padin's personal\n\nuse.  The court then imposed sentence.  The sentence included\n\na 15-year  term of imprisonment and an order compelling Padin\n\nto  pay  $852,000 in  restitution  to the  government.   This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n     Padin first contends that the district court in imposing\n\nsentence relied on irrelevant  and mistaken information.

Padin claims that  the court improperly\n\nconsidered   allegations  that  he   withheld  disclosure  of\n\naccounting ledgers subpoenaed by the government, and that the\n\namount of  losses claimed by the  government was unsupported.\n\n     A trial court  has very broad discretion to  decide what\n\ninformation  is relevant  for  sentencing  purposes.

The so-\n               \n\ncalled \"allegations\"--that important  ledgers were  missing--\n\nwere supported by the testimony of a government  auditor, who\n\nfurther stated  that the  government's audit was  hampered by\n\n                             -4-\n\nthe  lack of  access to  the documents.   Padin's  failure to\n\nproduce the requested ledgers  or plausibly account for their\n\nwhereabouts  was a  relevant  circumstance that  the district\n\ncourt could consider  in imposing sentence.   See Roberts  v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110234\"><a href=\"/opinion/110234/roberts-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1980) (trial court may properly\n             \n\nconsider  as  a  sentencing  factor  defendant's  refusal  to\n\ncooperate with law enforcement officials).\n\n     As  to the amount of  government losses,   Padin did not\n\ndeny that the government had paid $11.5 million to Ginnie Mae\n\ninsured  investors to  cover  Prudential's default.   Rather,\n\nPadin claimed  that this  figure overstated the  loss to  the\n\ngovernment because, according  to Padin, he used  some of the\n\nconverted  federal  funds  to sustain  mortgages  that  would\n\notherwise have  fallen into default.   As the  district court\n\npointed  out, however,  the number  of would-be  defaults, if\n\nany, could  only be  determined by  reference to the  ledgers\n\nwhich Padin  failed to  provide.  Under  these circumstances,\n\nthe auditor's testimony as to the basic loss of $11.5 million\n\nwas  sufficient.   See United  States v.

The obstruction finding was based on Padin's\n\nwithholding of the financial ledgers.    \n\n     We  find no  error in  the district  court's use  of the\n\nundisclosed  work sheet.  To be sure, a defendant is entitled\n\nto  notice  of  factual  information  that  will  affect  his\n\nsentence as  well as  an opportunity  to respond,  see United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.

While the work  sheet itself\n\nwas not disclosed prior to sentencing, Padin had ample notice\n\nof  the  underlying  negative  information  reflected in  the\n\ndocument.1      Additionally, the  parties were  advised well\n\nahead of  sentencing that  the district court  would consider\n\nthe  Sentencing  Guidelines in  imposing  sentence.   As  for\n\nacceptance of  responsibility, it is a  mitigating factor and\n\n                    \n\n     1The charge that  Padin impeded  justice by  withholding\naccounting ledgers was set forth as a count in the indictment\nand reiterated  in the pre-sentence report  released to Padin\nin  advance  of sentencing.    The  pre-sentence report  also\ncontained the  probation officer's assessment  that Padin had\nabused a position of trust.\n\n                             -6-\n\nit was  up to Padin's  counsel to  raise the  issue with  the\n\ndistrict court if Padin hoped to obtain credit on this score.\n\n     In addition to attacking his  sentence as a whole, Padin\n\nchallenges  the restitution  order on  several grounds.   The\n\nprincipal  ground  is  that  the district  court,  in  taking\n\nPadin's  guilty  plea, neglected  to  first  inform him  that\n\nrestitution could be imposed  as part of his sentence.   Fed.\n\nR.  Crim. P. 11(c)(1) provides that in addition to much else,\n\nthe  court must tell  the defendant prior to  his plea of the\n\nmaximum penalties, including \"when applicable, that the court\n\nmay also  order  the defendant  to  make restitution  to  any\n\nvictim of  the offense.\"   The government concedes  that this\n\nwarning was not given.\n\n     This objection is  raised for the first  time on appeal.\n\nPadin's  counsel  asserts  that  he  was  caught  off  guard:\n\nrestitution  was  not  mentioned  until  the   judge  imposed\n\nsentence  at the  conclusion of  the sentencing  hearing, and\n\nfinal judgement was entered that same day.  The error is  not\n\ndisputed, and is apparent  on the face of the  record without\n\nfurther  findings.  Rule 11 objections, so far as they affect\n\nthe \"knowing\" character  of the plea, are  treated with extra\n\nsolicitude.  United States v. Parra-Ibanez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563642\"><a href=\"/opinion/563642/united-states-v-francisco-j-parra-ibanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1991).   Under  all of the  circumstances, we  will\n\nconsider the issue under the \"plain error\" doctrine.\n\n                             -7-\n\n     The government says that  the error, even if  plain, was\n\nnot  prejudicial   because   Padin  must   have  known   that\n\nrestitution was an issue, given  the attention devoted to the\n\namount of  the government's  loss.   Most  of that  attention\n\noccurred  after the  plea  was taken.    More important,  the\n\namount of the loss  was clearly pertinent to the  severity of\n\nthe  prison term, so there was good reason for this attention\n\nregardless of restitution.  Cf. U.S.S.G.   2B1.1(b)(1)(1992).\n                              \n\nIf the government could show from the record that at the time\n\nof  his  plea  Padin actually  knew  that  restitution was  a\n\npossibility,  this would be a different case. It has not done\n\nso.\n\n     The more difficult problem  stems from the warning given\n\nto  Padin  before his  plea that  $21,000  in fines  might be\n\nimposed.  A  number of circuits  have held that a  warning of\n\nfines can render harmless the failure to warn of restitution,\n\nat  least so  long as  any payments  actually ordered  do not\n\nexceed the figure stated to the defendant at the time of  his\n\nplea.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991).\n            \n\n     In  our view,  whether  an omitted  Rule  11 warning  is\n\nprejudicial or harmless turns on the circumstances and we see\n\nno  reason to  lay down  a general  rule.   In this  case, no\n\nreason has been suggested  to us why Padin's choice  to plead\n\nwould  have been different if  he had been  told that $21,000\n\nmight be  imposed  as restitution,  rather  than as  a  fine.\n\nIndeed, usually restitution is the more attractive label from\n\nthe defendant's standpoint, since it reduces the  defendant's\n\ncivil liability  to the victim.   In this case, we  think the\n\nRule 11 violation,  although plain, was also  harmless to the\n\nextent of  $21,000 and  harmful  beyond that  amount.   Since\n\nPadin had  been told at  the plea  hearing that this  was the\n\nmaximum  fine on all three  counts, warning of  a much larger\n\namount could reasonably have  affected his decision to plead.\n\nThe  government now says that Padin was actually subject to a\n\nfine of $250,000 on each count, but no one claims that he was\n\nso advised at the time he pled.\n\n     The  question remains whether a remand is required.  The\n\ngovernment has made  plain in  its brief that  it prefers  to\n\nretain  the  guilty  plea even  at  the  cost  of losing  any\n\nrestitution.   This is an   understandable choice, especially\n\nbecause the  government may  still have an  independent civil\n\nclaim against  Padin for its losses.   At the same  time, the\n\n                             -9-\n\nchoice  of  sentence is  normally a  matter for  the district\n\ncourt.   In theory, had it known that the restitution ordered\n\nwas  unavailable, the  district  court could  have chosen  to\n\nimpose a longer prison sentence--the maximum was 20 years--or\n\neven  given  Padin  a  corrected  warning  as  to  sanctions,\n\nallowing him at the same time to  withdraw his guilty plea if\n\nhe chose.\n\n     In  this  case, we  think a  remand  would be  a useless\n\nformality.  The government  has made it clear that  annulling\n\nor reducing the restitution  ordered is its preferred outcome\n\nif the court finds prejudicial error.  We cannot imagine that\n\nthe district court would  increase the existing  fifteen-year\n\nsentence, let  alone reopen  the guilty plea,  simply because\n\nthe  amount   of  direct  restitution  is   reduced  and  the\n\ngovernment  remitted to a civil  suit.  Padin  himself has no\n\nbasis  for complaint since under  the modified judgment he is\n\nobliged to pay no  more than he was warned of at  the time of\n\nhis guilty plea.  \n\n     Padin's  brief contesting  his  sentence  contains  many\n\nseparate arguments,  some of  which overlap while  others are\n\nmooted  by  our  resolution.     We  have  addressed  Padin's\n\nprincipal  contentions  and  considered  the  others  without\n\nfinding further error.  The  judgment is modified by reducing\n                                                 \n\nthe  restitution   ordered  to  $21,000,   and  is  otherwise\n\naffirmed.\n        \n\n                             -10-\n</pre>",
