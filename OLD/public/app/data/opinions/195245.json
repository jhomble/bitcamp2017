The  district court\n\ngranted summary judgment  to the defendant on the ground that\n\nplaintiff had failed to raise a substantial issue relating to\n\nthe  reasonableness of  the Corps'  search for  the documents\n\nrequested.

The  court observed  that  the  crux  of\n\nplaintiff's disagreement with the Corps apparently relates to\n\nhis  perception  that the  permit  was  improperly issued,  a\n\nmatter not  reviewable  under the  guise of  an FOIA  action.\n\nReviewing the dismissal de  novo, we agree with the  district\n                                \n\ncourt's analysis and affirm substantially for the reasons set\n\nforth in  Judge McAuliffe's thorough memorandum  and order of\n\nMay 28,  1993.
