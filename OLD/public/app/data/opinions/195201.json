Knapp Shoes Inc., the plaintiff\n                           \n\nin this commercial dispute, appeals from the district court's\n\norder  dissolving a preliminary  injunction.  That injunction\n\nhad  frozen assets of  the defendant, Sylvania  Shoe Manufac-\n\nturing Corp., in an amount sufficient to satisfy  a potential\n\njudgment in Knapp's favor.   Because we find that the primary\n\nground of the court's order  is a defense that was  waived by\n\nSylvania,  and that the court's findings were insufficient to\n\nsupport  its  action  on  the  alternative  ground  urged  by\n\nSylvania, we  vacate  the order  dissolving  the  preliminary\n\ninjunction.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Knapp sells work shoes at  both the wholesale and retail\n\nlevels,  including a  line  of shoes  with  a patented  slip-\n\nresistant  rubber sole.   Beginning  in 1986  or  1987, Knapp\n\nplaced orders with Sylvania for the latter to manufacture and\n\nsupply   Knapp  with  several   different  styles   of  shoes\n\nincorporating Knapp's slip-resistant sole.  Knapp intended to\n\nresell the shoes both through its retail outlets and directly\n\nto  large  customers  in  the  restaurant,  hotel  and  other\n\nindustries.  Between 1987 and 1989, Sylvania manufactured and\n\ndelivered over 250,000 pairs of shoes to Knapp.\n\n     Sometime  in  1987,  Knapp  became concerned  about  the\n\nquality  of the shoes manufactured  by Sylvania.  The primary\n\nproblem was  the tendency  of the sole  to separate  from the\n\n                             -2-\n\nleather body  of the  shoe.  Although  the parties  disagreed\n\n(both then and now) as to the extent of the problem, Sylvania\n\nmade  a number  of changes  in construction  of the  shoes in\n\norder  to eliminate  the  problem.   According  to its  later\n\ncomplaint, Knapp was assured by Sylvania on various occasions\n\nbetween 1987 and 1989 that the sole adhesion problem had been\n\nremedied.  These  assurances, Knapp asserts, were  untrue; it\n\nsays that the proportion of defects remained high and in some\n\nperiods approached 100% for certain styles.\n\n     On April  10, 1990,  Knapp filed  this diversity  action\n\nunder Massachusetts  law for  breach of  contract (count  1),\n\nbreach  of  express   warranty  and  implied   warranties  of\n\nmerchantability  and fitness (counts 2-4), breach of the duty\n\nof good faith and fair dealing (count 5), fraud and negligent\n\nmisrepresentation  (counts 6 and  7), and violation  of Mass.\n\nGen.  Laws Ann.  ch. 93A  (count 8).1   The  gravamen of  all\n\nthese claims was  that too many of the  shoes manufactured by\n\nSylvania and sold to Knapp were defective. \n\n     Knapp's  complaint was  quite detailed in  setting forth\n\nthe categories of damages it claimed to have suffered.  These\n\nincluded increased costs  of inspection and for  handling and\n\nreturning  defective  shoes;  lost  profits  due  to  Knapp's\n\n                    \n\n     1Chapter 93A  outlaws \"[u]nfair  methods of  competition\nand unfair or  deceptive acts or practices in  the conduct of\nany trade or commerce.\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93A,   2(a),\nand  it permits  awards of  multiple  damages and  attorney's\nfees.  Id.   11.\n          \n\n                             -3-\n\ninability  to  fill  orders  for  customers;  losses  due  to\n\nSylvania's  refusal to  give credit  for  certain shoes  that\n\nKnapp  did return  or attempted  to  return; increased  costs\n\nbecause  Knapp was forced  to make substitute  purchases from\n\nother  manufacturers; credits and price concessions Knapp had\n\nto  afford its own customers because of their dissatisfaction\n\nwith defective shoes; and losses in good will and in customer\n\norders due to Sylvania's conduct.\n\n     Sylvania filed an  answer and counterclaim.   The answer\n\ndenied  virtually all of  the incriminating allegations.   It\n\nalso asserted  13 affirmative  defenses, including  estoppel,\n\ndisclaimer   of   warranties,  unclean   hands,   laches  and\n\ncontributory  negligence.   Sylvania's  counterclaim  alleged\n\nthat Knapp still owed Sylvania about $277,000 for shoe orders\n\nnot  yet paid  (Sylvania also  claimed  multiple damages  and\n\nattorney's  fees  under  Chapter  93A).     The  counterclaim\n\nsuggested   that  any  defects   were  due  to   Knapp's  own\n\nspecification  of materials to  be used in  manufacturing its\n\nshoes.\n\n     Both parties  consented to  proceed before a  magistrate\n\njudge and  waived a  jury trial.   The trial  was bifurcated,\n\nwith the liability phase covering  nine trial days in January\n\n1991.  At the conclusion  of this phase, the magistrate judge\n\non January 31, 1991, entered a four-page memorandum and order\n\nthat devoted  one  paragraph each  to five  of Knapp's  eight\n\n                             -4-\n\ncounts,  without  discussing  Sylvania's counterclaim.    The\n\nfirst substantive paragraph reads as follows:\n\n               Except to the  extent that plaintiff\n          has  shown,  or  can  show,  that   shoes\n          manufactured by  defendant and  delivered\n          to plaintiff,  and/or shoes  manufactured\n          by   defendant   to   be   delivered   to\n          plaintiff,  were,  in   fact,  defective,\n          plaintiff  has  failed  to  satisfy  this\n          court by a preponderance of the  evidence\n          that   defendant   breached   an  express\n                                                   \n          warranty.      None    of   the   parties\n          anticipated,    or    could,    in    the\n          circumstances,   reasonably   anticipate,\n          that each and every  shoe manufactured by\n          defendant for the plaintiff would be free\n          of  defect.     On  its  part,  defendant\n          expressly promised that it  would use its\n          best  effort  to  produce  a  defect-free\n          shoe,   and   that    it   would   credit\n          plaintiff's account  for those  defective\n          shoes  which  plaintiff  returned.    All\n          parties clearly understood  that that was\n          the  extent  of   the  express  warranty,\n          nothing more, and nothing less.\n\n     In the subsequent paragraphs, the magistrate judge found\n\nthat   Knapp   had   failed   to   prove   fraud,   negligent\n\nmisrepresentation or--\"except  to the  extent that  plaintiff\n\nhas  shown, or  can show,\"  a refusal  by Sylvania  to credit\n\nreturned  defective shoes--breach of  the duty of  good faith\n\nand  fair dealing.   As  for Knapp's  chapter 93A  claim, the\n\norder said that  Sylvania had not been shown  to have engaged\n\nin conduct so unscrupulous as  to make it liable for multiple\n\ndamages;  it noted, but did not  decide, the question whether\n\nattorney's fees might  be due Knapp under chapter  93A on the\n\n                             -5-\n\ntheory that a  breach of warranty was a  violation of chapter\n\n93A under a regulation of the state's attorney general.\n\n     In May 1991, prior to  the damages phase of trial, Knapp\n\ndiscovered  that Sylvania  was  going  out  of  business  and\n\nliquidating its assets.  Fearful that Sylvania would  soon be\n\njudgment-proof, Knapp obtained a  temporary restraining order\n\nprecluding  Sylvania from dissipating assets in the amount of\n\n$3,775,657.22--the  amount of  damages  that  Knapp hoped  to\n\nprove in  the next phase of the  trial.  The magistrate judge\n\nmodified this  order on June  10, 1991, converting it  into a\n\npreliminary injunction and  amending it to allow  Sylvania to\n\nmake limited payments to its creditors and lawyers.\n\n     The damages phase of trial  took place over five days in\n\nJune  1991;  at  Sylvania's  behest,  an  additional  day  of\n\nevidence  was heard on November  25, 1991.  Proposed findings\n\nwere filed  by both  sides in  March 1992.   It  appears that\n\nnothing further  occurred during the next 12 months until, in\n\nMarch 1993, the magistrate judge issued an order proposing to\n\ncertify  certain  questions   to  the  Massachusetts  Supreme\n\nJudicial Court.   Both  sides opposed  certification, but  on\n\nApril 8, 1993,  the magistrate judge certified  two questions\n\nto the Supreme  Judicial Court; both related  to the possible\n\napplication of Chapter 93A to \"a simple breach of warranty.\"2\n\n                    \n\n     2The first question  was whether a regulation  issued by\nthe  state attorney  general under  chapter  93A, defining  a\nviolation to  include  a breach  of  warranty, applied  to  a\n\n                             -6-\n\n     In the certification, the  magistrate judge prefaced the\n\ntwo  certified  questions  with a  ten-page  statement.   The\n\nstatement repeated the magistrate judge's rulings on the five\n\ncounts discussed  in its  January 31,  1991, order,  and then\n\nmade several additional  findings of fact and  conclusions of\n\nlaw.  These  determinations were prefaced by a statement that\n\n\"only the  ultimate findings  and conclusions  are set  forth\n\nherein - not the  subsidiary findings and conclusions.\"   The\n\nmagistrate judge determined inter alia that:\n                                      \n\n               1.    .  .  .  .  By  their  express\n          negotiations,     by     their    express\n          understandings,  and  by   their  express\n          course  of  dealings,  Sylvania  promised\n          Knapp  that, in the event that shoes were\n          defectively manufactured, Knapp's remedy,\n          and sole remedy, would be the replacement\n                  \n          of  [or credit for]  those shoes shown to\n          be defective and returned - nothing more,\n          and nothing less [footnote omitted].\n\n               2.    Because  of  this  clear   and\n          express    understanding   between    the\n          respective    parties,    Knapp's    sole\n                                                   \n          remedies, in terms of breach of contract,\n          or under  the relevant provisions  of the\n          Uniform Commercial  Code, are  limited to\n          the replacement of [or credit for]  those\n          shoes shown to  be defective and returned\n          to Sylvania.\n\n     Other determinations included a ruling that Sylvania was\n\nobliged to give  a credit for or replace  any defective shoes\n\n                    \n\ntransaction  of the kind  described by the  magistrate judge,\nnamely, a breach as between two similarly situated businesses\nbased on  delivery of  a \"minute\"  portion of  non-conforming\ngoods.   If the  answer were yes,  the second  question asked\nwhether  the  regulation  was  valid  under  the  authorizing\nstatute.\n\n                             -7-\n\nreturned by  Knapp;  a  statement  that  many  of  the  shoes\n\nreturned  by Knapp's  customers  were  made  by  an  overseas\n\nsupplier; a  finding that Sylvania acted in  \"the utmost good\n\nfaith\"  to correct  a problem  \"not  reasonably foreseen\"  by\n\neither side; and a finding in  a final footnote that \"at best\n\n.  . .  approximately three  (3)  percent of  the shoes  were\n\nallegedly  defective .  . .  and as  to  a majority  of those\n\nshoes,  credit  was  given to  Knapp  when  those  shoes were\n\nreturned . . . .\"  \n\n     The Supreme  Judicial  Court  has  yet  to  act  on  the\n\nquestions  certified  by the  district  court.   But  on  the\n\nstrength  of   the  magistrate   judge's   findings  in   the\n\ncertification  order, Sylvania  moved on  April  8, 1993,  to\n\ndissolve the  preliminary injunction.   The  magistrate judge\n\ngranted  this  motion on  May  5, 1993,  concluding  that its\n\nearlier   findings  left  Knapp   with  so  little   hope  of\n\nsubstantial recovery  that  the freeze  on Sylvania's  assets\n\ncould no longer be justified.  The order set forth findings 1\n\nand 2 from the certification, quoted in pertinent part above.\n\n     Knapp filed a notice of appeal on May 11, 1993, and this\n\ncourt  stayed the  magistrate  judge's  order dissolving  the\n\npreliminary injunction  pending the  outcome of  this appeal.\n\nWe  have jurisdiction  pursuant to  28  U.S.C.    1292(a)(1),\n\nwhich permits  appeals from  interlocutory orders  dissolving\n\ninjunctions.\n\n                             -8-\n\n                             II.\n\n     This circuit has  not explicitly addressed the  standard\n\nto  be applied  by a  district court  in deciding  whether to\n\ndissolve a preliminary  injunction.  But we  think it evident\n\nthat in  the ordinary case  dissolution should depend  on the\n\nsame considerations that guide a judge in deciding whether to\n\ngrant  or deny a  preliminary injunction in  the first place.\n\nThe  familiar quartet  includes  likelihood  of success,  the\n\nthreat of  irreparable injury  to the  party seeking  interim\n\nrelief, the  equities and  the public interest.3   It  is not\n\nsurprising that a  fresh look after the trial  evidence is in\n\nmight produce a  different judgment about the  probability of\n\nsuccess.\n\n     In dissolving  the preliminary injunction in  this case,\n\nthe magistrate  judge relied upon his  certification findings\n\nthat the parties had agreed to limit their remedies under the\n\ncontract  to return and  replacement or credit  for defective\n\nshoes.  As already  noted, the magistrate judge  concluded in\n\nfinding  number 1 that  \"[b]y their express  negotiations, by\n\ntheir  express understandings, and by their express course of\n\ndealings, Sylvania  promised Knapp  that, in  the event  that\n\nshoes were defectively manufactured, Knapp's remedy, and sole\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n     3See, e.g., Teradyne, Inc. v. Mostek Corp., 797 F.2d 43,\n                                               \n51  (1st   Cir.  1986);     Planned   Parenthood  League   of\n                                                             \nMassachusetts  v. Bellotti,  641 F.2d  1006,  1009 (1st  Cir.\n                          \n1981).\n\n                             -9-\n\nremedy, would  be the  replacement of [or  credit for]  those\n\nshoes shown to be defective  and returned - nothing more, and\n\nnothing less.\"\n\n     Accordingly,  the  magistrate  judge held  that  Knapp's\n\nclaims for damages, see Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 106,   2-715\n                       \n\n(buyer's   ordinary   damages),       7-16  (incidental   and\n\nconsequential  damages), over  and  above  credits for  shoes\n\nactually returned to Sylvania, were barred by Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nAnn.   ch.   106,  2-719;4   hence,  Knapp's   likelihood  of\n\nsubstantial   recovery  was   insufficient  to   support  the\n\npreliminary injunction.  We need not decide whether a section\n\n2-719 defense was supported by the evidence, because we  hold\n\nthat  Sylvania waived any such limitation of remedies defense\n\nby failing to raise it in a timely fashion.\n\n                    \n\n     4Mass.  Gen. Laws  Ann. ch.  106,    2-719,  pertinently\nprovides:\n\n     Contractual Modification or Limitation of Remedy\n\n     (1)  .  .  .  (a)  the  agreement  may provide  for\n     remedies  in addition  to  or  in substitution  for\n     those provided  in this  Article and  may limit  or\n     alter the measure of damages recoverable under this\n     article,  as by  limiting the  buyer's  remedies to\n     return of  the goods and repayment of  the price or\n     to repair  and replacement of  non-conforming goods\n     or parts;  and\n\n     (b)  resort to  a remedy  as  provided is  optional\n     unless  the  remedy  is  expressly   agreed  to  be\n     exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.\n\n                             -10-\n\n     Fed. R. Civ.  P. 8(c) requires a party  to affirmatively\n\nplead  certain  specified  defenses, as  well  as  \"any other\n\nmatter  constituting  an avoidance  or  affirmative defense.\"\n\nAffirmative defenses not so pleaded  are waived.  See FDIC v.\n                                                          \n\nRamirez-Rivera, 869 F.2d  624, 626 (1st Cir. 1989).   We have\n              \n\npreviously held that a  statutory provision limiting  damages\n\nto  a  fixed  sum  constituted  an  affirmative  defense  for\n\npurposes  of Rule  8(c).    Jakobsen  v.  Massachusetts  Port\n                                                             \n\nAuthority, 520 F.2d 810, 813  (1st Cir. 1975).  Section 2-719\n         \n\nperforms the same damage limitation function, and there is no\n\nreason to reach a contrary result here.  See also Ingraham v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States, 808 F.2d 1075, 1079 (5th Cir. 1987).\n             \n\n     Sylvania failed to raise the  defense in its answer, its\n\namended answer, its pretrial memorandum, or its proposed jury\n\ninstructions.5   Indeed, there  is no indication  that either\n\nof  the parties thought  that a limitation  of remedies issue\n\nwas present in  the case until the ninth and final day of the\n\nliability phase  of trial.  At  that point, after  all of the\n\nevidence  had  been  submitted,  the  magistrate  judge  said\n\n\"[w]e've  got a  problem,  I think  under  Section 719(b)  of\n\nwhether  or not  .  . .  the  parties agreed  that  defective\n\nreturns, credits for [sic] would be the sole remedy.\"\n\n                    \n\n     5The parties submitted proposed  jury instructions prior\nto  their waiver  of trial  by  jury and  consent to  proceed\nbefore the magistrate judge.\n\n                             -11-\n\n     Sylvania  does  not  dispute   that  the  limitation  of\n\nremedies is an affirmative defense.  Nor does it suggest that\n\nit raised that defense in  its answer or elsewhere.  Instead,\n\nSylvania argues that the statement of the magistrate judge at\n\nthe close of the liability stage,  as well as later ones made\n\nby the magistrate  judge in the damages phase, put plaintiffs\n\non notice as to the issue.  We do not agree.\n\n     The reason why affirmative defenses under Rule 8(c) must\n\nbe pled in the answer is to give the opposing party notice of\n\nthe  defense  and a  chance  to  develop  evidence and  offer\n\narguments  to   controvert  the   defense.

Some courts have excused noncompliance\n\nwith  Rule  8(c)  if  \"a  plaintiff  receives  notice  of  an\n\naffirmative defense by  some means other than  pleadings\" and\n\nis not  prejudiced by  the omission of  the defense  from the\n\ninitial pleading.  E.g., Moore, Owen, Thomas &amp; Co. v. Coffey,\n                                                            \n\n992 F.2d  1439, 1445 (6th Cir. 1993).  This court reached the\n\nsame result where  a defense \"has been fully  tried under the\n\nexpress or implied consent of the parties, as if it  had been\n\nraised in the original  responsive pleading.\" Ramirez-Rivera,\n                                                            \n\n869 F.2d at 626-27.\n\n     We need not decide whether notice and no prejudice would\n\nalso serve  as an excuse  in this circuit, cf.  Jakobsen, 520\n                                             \n\nF.2d at 813  (referring favorably to the  no-prejudice test),\n\n                             -12-\n\nsince  we find that neither the Coffey nor the Ramirez-Rivera\n                                                             \n\nstandard was met  here.  In the present  case, the limitation\n\nof remedies issue  was not raised until virtually  the end of\n\nthe  liability trial, after  discovery and the  submission of\n\nall  of the  evidence on  liability.   Nor  did the  parties'\n\npresentation of witnesses  or documents focus on  this issue.\n\nRather, the magistrate  judge's ruling seems to  have derived\n\nfrom  a fragment  of testimony  from one  witness:   a former\n\nKnapp executive named John  Esser testified that he  had told\n\nthe  Knapp president in July 1989 that Sylvania \"[had] agreed\n\nand will  agree, if  we do  have a  claim, to  take back  any\n\nshoes, and always have.\"  \n\n     This  is pretty thin  stuff, even coupled  with evidence\n\nfrom   other  sources   that   the   parties  had   extensive\n\narrangements  for the return  of defective goods  in exchange\n\nfor credit.  The question,  after all, is not whether credits\n\nwere an available remedy  but whether the parties had  agreed\n\nthat credits were the exclusive  remedy.  See Mass. Gen. Laws\n                                             \n\nAnn. ch. 106,    2-719(1)(b) (quoted in note 4  above).  More\n\nto the point,  Esser's statement in context  was not elicited\n\nby Sylvania  to show that credits were  the exclusive remedy,\n\nnor  did  Knapp  cross-examine  in order  to  refute  such  a\n\nsuggestion, which after all Sylvania had not previously made.\n\nThus the parties  did not litigate the limitation of remedies\n\nissue in the liability phase of the trial.\n\n                             -13-\n\n     Nor  was the  issue  litigated  in  the  damages  phase.\n\nAlthough in this  phase the magistrate judge  adverted to the\n\nlimitation of remedies  issue, his brief remarks  suggest not\n\nthat  it was  now  open  to litigation  but  rather that  the\n\nparties either had or should  have addressed the issue in the\n\nliability  phase of the trial.6   One can argue as to whether\n\nthe  limitation of remedies  issue is  better described  as a\n\nliability or a damage issue.  But in this case, the issue was\n\nnot litigated  in the former phase and  it would have taken a\n\nfortune  teller  to  suppose  that  such  evidence  would  be\n\nwelcomed in the latter phase.\n\n     In  sum, we conclude that Sylvania waived the limitation\n\nof remedies defense by  failing to assert it in the answer or\n\nby amendment in  accordance with Rule 8(c).   The defense was\n\nnot  resurrected either by clear  notice given prior to trial\n\nor by actual litigation of the  issue in the course of trial.\n\nThus the  limitation of remedies  defense is out of  the case\n\nand cannot support the order vacating the injunction.\n\n                             III.\n\n                    \n\n     6On  the first day  of the damages  trial the magistrate\njudge, in ruling on an in limine motion by Sylvania to  limit\n                                \nevidence,  said that  the motion  was granted \"to  the extent\nit's already  [sic] on  what type of  remedy is  available as\nopposed to what  damage is suffered.\" In a  written order the\nnext day,  the magistrate  judge--speaking  of the  liability\nphase--said:   \"An overriding  issue -  recognized, or  which\nshould  have been  recognized by  the  parties -  was and  is\nwhether parties agreed to limit their respective remedies . .\n. .\"\n\n                             -14-\n\n     Sylvania  argues that the order under review may, in the\n\nalternative,  be  upheld  based  on  the  magistrate  judge's\n\nfinding  that only  a  very  small  percentage of  the  shoes\n\nmanufactured by Sylvania for Knapp were defective.  If only a\n\nvery small fraction  of the shoes made by  Sylvania for Knapp\n\nwere defective, it might well follow that the damages claimed\n\nby Knapp were wildly excessive and that the injunction was no\n\nlonger needed or  ought to be reduced in amount.   After all,\n\npractically all of  the types  of damage  claimed in  Knapp's\n\ncomplaint (and recited above) depend as a practical matter on\n\nthe  premise  that  a  large percentage  of  the  shoes  were\n\ndefective.  \n\n     But in this case we have no way to review or sustain the\n\ncritical determinations--that the defective shoes were a very\n\nsmall  quantity--about  three percent--because  there  are no\n\nsupporting findings by the magistrate judge.  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n52(a)  requires that \"in  granting or  refusing interlocutory\n\ninjunctions the court shall .  . . set forth the  findings of\n\nfact and conclusions  of law which constitute the  grounds of\n\nits action.\"   This requirement,  which also attaches  to the\n\ncourt's own final  decision in a jury waived  trial, id., but\n                                                        \n\nnot to  most other rulings,  id., reflects the  importance of\n                                \n\ninjunctions  and of  providing an  adequate  basis for  their\n\nappellate review.\n\n                             -15-\n\n     Sylvania argues  that Rule  52(a) is  not applicable  to\n\nthis case  because the  rule, by its  terms, applies  only to\n\ndecisions \"granting  or refusing  interlocutory injunctions.\"\n\nAlthough  there  is  some  general  support  for   Sylvania's\n\nposition, see Baltimore &amp; O. R. R. v. Chicago R. &amp;  I. R. R.,\n                                                            \n\n170 F.2d 654, 659 (7th Cir. 1948), cert. denied, 336 U.S. 944\n                                               \n\n(1949); Munoz  v.

We\n               \n\nagree that where a court made adequate findings when granting\n\nthe preliminary  injunction in the  first place, it  need not\n\nrestate those findings in order to maintain the injunction.\n\n     A decision to vacate  an existing preliminary injunction\n                         \n\nis quite another matter.  It is not only a substantial change\n\nin the status quo but is the effective equivalent of a denial\n                                                             \n\nof  a preliminary  injunction,  an event  that unquestionably\n\ntriggers Rule  52(a)'s requirement  of findings.   We do  not\n\nthink that  it stretches Rule 52(a) unduly  to apply it to an\n\norder vacating a  preliminary injunction.   But the need  for\n\nfindings in such a case is so strong that we would impose the\n\nfindings  requirement ourselves if we thought that Rule 52(a)\n\nhad left an inadvertent loophole.\n\n                             -16-\n\n     Given  our  conclusion  that Rule  52(a)  findings  were\n\nrequired, we cannot sustain the order vacating the injunction\n\nin this  case on the alternative ground  offered by Sylvania,\n\nnamely,  the  small  percentage  of  defective  shoes.    The\n\nmagistrate   judge  did  not   rely  at  all   on  Sylvania's\n\nalternative  ground.  Instead, in  a footnote sentence at the\n\nclose  of the certification, the magistrate judge observed in\n\nexplaining the  questions being certified:   \"[T]he plaintiff\n\nhas shown that \n\nthree  (3) per cent  of the shoes  were allegedly defective.\"\n\nWe do not think that this sentence is sufficient for purposes\n\nof Rule 52(a).\n\n     Admittedly, the case law lays down few clear rules as to\n\nwhat is  adequate compliance with  Rule 52(a).  We  have said\n\nthat \"conclusory  findings\" are  not enough,  Thermo Electron\n                                                             \n\nCorp. v.

The  difficulty in  devising a\n\nyardstick  is not  surprising when  one  considers the  great\n\ndiversity of disputes governed by the rule.\n\n                             -17-\n\n     In  the abstract,  one might  or  might not  describe as\n\n\"conclusory\" a magistrate  judge's statement  that the  shoes\n\ndelivered by  Sylvania to  Knapp had a  defect rate  of about\n\nthree percent:   the statement is specific  and concrete, but\n\nunexplained.   In truth, pinning  a label like  \"ultimate\" or\n\n\"conclusory\"  on a single sentence  is not very helpful; Rule\n\n52(a)  calls  for  a  level  of  detail  adequate  to  permit\n                                                 \n\nappellate  review on  factual issues,  and  what is  adequate\n\ndepends on the  importance of an  issue, its complexity,  the\n\ndepth  and nature of evidence presented, and similar elements\n\nthat  vary  from case  to  case.    See generally  Kelley  v.\n                                                         \n\nEverglades Drainage District, 319 U.S. 415, 420 (1943).\n                            \n\n     Here the  percentage of defects is critically important.\n\nOf course, the  magistrate judge could not know  that his own\n\nbasis for dissolving  the injunction would  be set aside  and\n\nthat Sylvania would rely on the percentage finding to support\n\nthe  dissolution order.   But  to the  extent that  the three\n\npercent finding is proffered by Sylvania  as a foundation for\n\nthe dissolution order,  it must meet the test  of Rule 52(a).\n\nFor this purpose,  the importance of the  issue requires more\n\nrather than less detail.  \n\n     In this case  there is no  detail whatever.   We do  not\n\nknow  how the magistrate  judge defined \"defect,\"  a disputed\n\nissue  at trial,  nor how  he  arrived at  the three  percent\n\nfigure, nor how he handled Knapp's claim  that the percentage\n\n                             -18-\n\nof shoes  actually returned  to Sylvania  greatly understated\n\nthe percentage of defects.7   On all of these issues there is\n\nno indication as to why certain witnesses were credited, what\n\ndata  was used  or how  it  was construed,  or why  competing\n\nevidence was rejected.  We are thus unable to make a reasoned\n\njudgment  whether, on  this critical  issue  of defects,  the\n\nmagistrate   judge's  finding   was  or   was  not   \"clearly\n\nerroneous.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n\n     In fairness to the magistrate judge, we note that he did\n\nnot  make  the  \"approximately three  (3)  per  cent\" finding\n\neither to support a final determination of damages (which has\n\nnot   yet  occurred)  or   to  support  dissolution   of  the\n\npreliminary injunction (it is Sylvania  who is trying to make\n\nthe finding play that role).  Rather the footnote finding was\n\nmade to flesh out a hypothetical statement in the body of the\n\ncertification.   There  is  no  requirement  for  Rule  52(a)\n\nfindings in certifying a legal question to a state court.  \n\n                             IV.\n\n     The trial in this case concluded on November 25, 1991, a\n\nyear and a half before  entry of the interlocutory order that\n\nforms the basis  of this appeal and  over two years  prior to\n\nthe present decision.  We  see little point in remanding this\n\n                    \n\n     7Knapp claimed  that many  of the  defective shoes  were\nsimply disregarded by  customers and that other  shoes, which\nKnapp sought  to return  to Sylvania  as defective,  were not\naccepted by Sylvania.\n\n                             -19-\n\ncase  for further  findings  with  respect  to  the  district\n\ncourt's  order dissolving the preliminary injunction.  In our\n\nview, the energies of both  the court and the litigants would\n\nbe more fruitfully directed toward a final resolution of this\n\ncase on the merits.    \n\n     Sylvania is,  of course,  free to file  a new  motion to\n\ndissolve the preliminary injunction.  But unless  it can show\n\nsome  urgent need  for the  release  of the  funds, we  would\n\nexpect  the magistrate judge  to refuse summarily  to revisit\n\nthe  preliminary  injunction  until  the  final  decision  is\n\nissued.  Knapp's  case was once thought to  have enough merit\n\nto  justify  an injunction;  as  yet there  are  no supported\n                                                             \n\nfindings that warrant a reappraisal of potential damages; and\n\nSylvania is apparently in the process of distributing  all of\n\nits unencumbered assets.\n\n     As for the certification, it relates only to the limited\n\nissue  of attorney's  fees under  chapter 93A.   Possibly the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court will have answered the questions posed\n\nby  the time  the  magistrate  judge is  ready  to issue  his\n\ndecision on  the merits.   If not,  the magistrate  judge may\n\nthink that the wiser course, in litigation that has otherwise\n\nbeen ripe  for resolution  at least since  March 1992,  is to\n\ndecide the  whole case  and make his  best conjecture  on the\n\nchapter 93A issues.  \n\n                             -20-\n\n     One  final issue  remains.   In  the order  vacating the\n\npreliminary injunction,  the magistrate judge  also dissolved\n\nthe attachment on trustee process.  An attachment on  trustee\n\nprocess is  an interim remedy  that was used here  to prevent\n\ncertain  persons owing funds to Sylvania from disbursing them\n\nto Sylvania, in effect protecting funds that might be used to\n\nsatisfy a  judgment for Knapp.  See Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. ch.\n                                   \n\n246   1; Fed. R. Civ.  P. 64; Mass R. Civ. P. 4.2.   Our stay\n\npending review kept both the injunction and the attachment in\n\neffect until disposition of this appeal.  \n\n     Sylvania argues  that the dissolution  of the attachment\n\nis  not  equivalent  to  the  dissolution  of  a  preliminary\n\ninjunction and is not an appealable event.  Knapp argues that\n\nthe attachment is appealable, citing Teradyne, Inc. v. Mostek\n                                                             \n\nCorp.,  797 F.2d  43, 44-47  (1st Cir. 1986),  but we  see no\n    \n\nreason  to  resolve  this  issue.    The  magistrate  judge's\n\nrationale   for  dissolving  both   the  injunction  and  the\n         \n\nattachment was  the same.  As we have found that rationale to\n\nconstitute legal error,  we assume that the  magistrate judge\n\nwill  on his  own  motion maintain  the  attachment in  force\n\nunless and until there is a proper basis for modifying.  \n\n     Sylvania says that  the funds under the  attachment have\n\nbeen  earning no interest  for two years.   If the  funds are\n\nunequivocally  owing to  Sylvania, there  should  be an  easy\n\nmeans for dealing with this problem (e.g.,  by an arrangement\n                                         \n\n                             -21-\n\ntransferring the funds to an interest bearing account subject\n\nto  the  attachment).    Nothing  in  this  opinion  prevents\n\nSylvania   from  applying  to  the  magistrate  judge  for  a\n\nmodification of the  attachment to address this  or any other\n\nproblem pertaining to the attachment.\n\n     The magistrate judge's order  dissolving the preliminary\n\ninjunction is vacated.\n                     \n\n                             -22-\n",

Knapp intended to resell the shoes both through its retail outlets and directly to large customers in the restaurant, hotel and other industries.  Between 1987 and 1989, Sylvania manufactured and delivered over 250,000 pairs of shoes to Knapp.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in 1987, Knapp became concerned about the quality of the shoes manufactured by Sylvania.  The primary problem was the tendency of the sole to separate from the leather body of the shoe.  Although the parties disagreed (both then and now) as to the extent of the problem, Sylvania made a number of changes in construction of the shoes in order to eliminate the problem.  According to its later complaint, Knapp was assured by Sylvania on various occasions between 1987 and 1989 that the sole adhesion problem had been remedied.  These assurances, Knapp asserts, were untrue;  it says that the proportion of defects remained high and in some periods approached 100% for certain styles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 10, 1990, Knapp filed this diversity action under Massachusetts law for breach of contract (count 1), breach of express warranty and implied warranties of merchantability and fitness (counts 2-4), breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing (count 5), fraud and negligent misrepresentation (counts 6 and 7), and violation of Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 93A (count 8).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The gravamen of all these claims was that too many of the shoes manufactured by Sylvania and sold to Knapp were defective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knapp's complaint was quite detailed in setting forth the categories of damages it claimed to have suffered.  These included increased costs of inspection and for handling and returning defective shoes;  lost profits due to Knapp's inability to fill orders for customers;  losses due to Sylvania's refusal to give credit for certain shoes that Knapp did return or attempted to return;  increased costs because Knapp was forced to make substitute purchases from other manufacturers; credits and price concessions Knapp had to afford its own customers because of their dissatisfaction with defective shoes;  and losses in good will and in customer orders due to Sylvania's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania filed an answer and counterclaim.  The answer denied virtually all of the incriminating allegations.  It also asserted 13 affirmative defenses, including estoppel, disclaimer of warranties, unclean hands, laches and contributory negligence.  Sylvania's counterclaim alleged that Knapp still owed Sylvania about $277,000 for shoe orders not yet paid (Sylvania also claimed multiple damages and attorney's fees under Chapter 93A).  The counterclaim suggested that any defects were due to Knapp's own specification of materials to be used in manufacturing its shoes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge and waived a jury trial.  The trial was bifurcated, with the liability phase covering nine trial days in January 1991.  At the conclusion of this phase, the magistrate judge on January 31, 1991, entered a four-page memorandum and order that devoted one paragraph each to five of Knapp's eight counts, without discussing Sylvania's counterclaim.  The first substantive paragraph reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except to the extent that plaintiff has shown, or can show, that shoes manufactured by defendant and delivered to plaintiff, and/or shoes manufactured by defendant to be delivered to plaintiff, were, in fact, defective, plaintiff has failed to satisfy this court by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant breached an express warranty.  None of the parties anticipated, or could, in the circumstances, reasonably anticipate, that each and every shoe manufactured by defendant for the plaintiff would be free of defect.  On its part, defendant expressly promised that it would use its best effort to produce a defect-free shoe, and that it would credit plaintiff's account for those defective shoes which plaintiff returned.  All parties clearly understood that that was the extent of the express warranty, nothing more, and nothing less.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the subsequent paragraphs, the magistrate judge found that Knapp had failed to prove fraud, negligent misrepresentation or--\"except to the extent that plaintiff has shown, or can show,\" a refusal by Sylvania to credit returned defective shoes--breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.  As for Knapp's chapter 93A claim, the order said that Sylvania had not been shown to have engaged in conduct so unscrupulous as to make it liable for multiple damages;  it noted, but did not decide, the question whether attorney's fees might be due Knapp under chapter 93A on the theory that a breach of warranty was a violation of chapter 93A under a regulation of the state's attorney general.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1991, prior to the damages phase of trial, Knapp discovered that Sylvania was going out of business and liquidating its assets.  Fearful that Sylvania would soon be judgment-proof, Knapp obtained a temporary restraining order precluding Sylvania from dissipating assets in the amount of $3,775,657.22--the amount of damages that Knapp hoped to prove in the next phase of the trial.  The magistrate judge modified this order on June 10, 1991, converting it into a preliminary injunction and amending it to allow Sylvania to make limited payments to its creditors and lawyers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The damages phase of trial took place over five days in June 1991;  at Sylvania's behest, an additional day of evidence was heard on November 25, 1991.  Proposed findings were filed by both sides in March 1992.  It appears that nothing further occurred during the next 12 months until, in March 1993, the magistrate judge issued an order proposing to certify certain questions to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.  Both sides opposed certification, but on April 8, 1993, the magistrate judge certified two questions to the Supreme Judicial Court;  both related to the possible application of Chapter 93A to \"a simple breach of warranty.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the certification, the magistrate judge prefaced the two certified questions with a ten-page statement.  The statement repeated the magistrate judge's rulings on the five counts discussed in its January 31, 1991, order, and then made several additional findings of fact and conclusions of law.  These determinations were prefaced by a statement that \"only the ultimate findings and conclusions are set forth herein--not the subsidiary findings and conclusions.\"   The magistrate judge determined inter alia that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. ....  By their express negotiations, by their express understandings, and by their express course of dealings, Sylvania promised Knapp that, in the event that shoes were defectively manufactured, Knapp's remedy, and sole remedy, would be the replacement of [or credit for] those shoes shown to be defective and returned--nothing more, and nothing less [footnote omitted].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Because of this clear and express understanding between the respective parties, Knapp's sole remedies, in terms of breach of contract, or under the relevant provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, are limited to the replacement of [or credit for] those shoes shown to be defective and returned to Sylvania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other determinations included a ruling that Sylvania was obliged to give a credit for or replace any defective shoes returned by Knapp;  a statement that many of the shoes returned by Knapp's customers were made by an overseas supplier;  a finding that Sylvania acted in \"the utmost good faith\" to correct a problem \"not reasonably foreseen\" by either side;  and a finding in a final footnote that \"at best ... approximately three (3) percent of the shoes were allegedly defective ... and as to a majority of those shoes, credit was given to Knapp when those shoes were returned....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court has yet to act on the questions certified by the district court.  But on the strength of the magistrate judge's findings in the certification order, Sylvania moved on April 8, 1993, to dissolve the preliminary injunction.  The magistrate judge granted this motion on May 5, 1993, concluding that its earlier findings left Knapp with so little hope of substantial recovery that the freeze on Sylvania's assets could no longer be justified.  The order set forth findings 1 and 2 from the certification, quoted in pertinent part above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knapp filed a notice of appeal on May 11, 1993, and this court stayed the magistrate judge's order dissolving the preliminary injunction pending the outcome of this appeal.  We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1), which permits appeals from interlocutory orders dissolving injunctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has not explicitly addressed the standard to be applied by a district court in deciding whether to dissolve a preliminary injunction.  But we think it evident that in the ordinary case dissolution should depend on the same considerations that guide a judge in deciding whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction in the first place.  The familiar quartet includes likelihood of success, the threat of irreparable injury to the party seeking interim relief, the equities and the public interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  It is not surprising that a fresh look after the trial evidence is in might produce a different judgment about the probability of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dissolving the preliminary injunction in this case, the magistrate judge relied upon his certification findings that the parties had agreed to limit their remedies under the contract to return and replacement or credit for defective shoes.  As already noted, the magistrate judge concluded in finding number 1 that \"[b]y their express negotiations, by their express understandings, and by their express course of dealings, Sylvania promised Knapp that, in the event that shoes were defectively manufactured, Knapp's remedy, and sole remedy, would be the replacement of [or credit for] those shoes shown to be defective and returned--nothing more, and nothing less.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the magistrate judge held that Knapp's claims for damages, see Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 106, Sec. 2-715 (buyer's ordinary damages), Sec. 7-16 (incidental and consequential damages), over and above credits for shoes actually returned to Sylvania, were barred by Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 106, Sec. 2-719;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  hence, Knapp's likelihood of substantial recovery was insufficient to support the preliminary injunction.  We need not decide whether a section 2-719 defense was supported by the evidence, because we hold that Sylvania waived any such limitation of remedies defense by failing to raise it in a timely fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c) requires a party to affirmatively plead certain specified defenses, as well as \"any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\"   Affirmative defenses not so pleaded are waived.  See FDIC v. Ramirez-Rivera, 869 F.2d 624, 626 (1st Cir.1989).  We have previously held that a statutory provision limiting damages to a fixed sum constituted an affirmative defense for purposes of Rule 8(c).  Jakobsen v. Massachusetts Port Authority, 520 F.2d 810, 813 (1st Cir.1975).  Section 2-719 performs the same damage limitation function, and there is no reason to reach a contrary result here.  See also Ingraham v. United States, 808 F.2d 1075, 1079 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania failed to raise the defense in its answer, its amended answer, its pretrial memorandum, or its proposed jury instructions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Indeed, there is no indication that either of the parties thought that a limitation of remedies issue was present in the case until the ninth and final day of the liability phase of trial.  At that point, after all of the evidence had been submitted, the magistrate judge said \"[w]e've got a problem, I think under Section 719(b) of whether or not ... the parties agreed that defective returns, credits for [sic] would be the sole remedy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania does not dispute that the limitation of remedies is an affirmative defense.  Nor does it suggest that it raised that defense in its answer or elsewhere.  Instead, Sylvania argues that the statement of the magistrate judge at the close of the liability stage, as well as later ones made by the magistrate judge in the damages phase, put plaintiffs on notice as to the issue.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason why affirmative defenses under Rule 8(c) must be pled in the answer is to give the opposing party notice of the defense and a chance to develop evidence and offer arguments to controvert the defense.  Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, 402 U.S. 313, 350, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 1453, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971).  Some courts have excused noncompliance with Rule 8(c) if \"a plaintiff receives notice of an affirmative defense by some means other than pleadings\" and is not prejudiced by the omission of the defense from the initial pleading.  E.g., Moore, Owen, Thomas &amp; Co. v. Coffey, 992 F.2d 1439, 1445 (6th Cir.1993).  This court reached the same result where a defense \"has been fully tried under the express or implied consent of the parties, as if it had been raised in the original responsive pleading.\"  Ramirez-Rivera, 869 F.2d at 626-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether notice and no prejudice would also serve as an excuse in this circuit, cf. Jakobsen, 520 F.2d at 813 (referring favorably to the no-prejudice test), since we find that neither the Coffey nor the Ramirez-Rivera standard was met here.  In the present case, the limitation of remedies issue was not raised until virtually the end of the liability trial, after discovery and the submission of all of the evidence on liability.  Nor did the parties' presentation of witnesses or documents focus on this issue.  Rather, the magistrate judge's ruling seems to have derived from a fragment of testimony from one witness:  a former Knapp executive named John Esser testified that he had told the Knapp president in July 1989 that Sylvania \"[had] agreed and will agree, if we do have a claim, to take back any shoes, and always have.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is pretty thin stuff, even coupled with evidence from other sources that the parties had extensive arrangements for the return of defective goods in exchange for credit.  The question, after all, is not whether credits were an available remedy but whether the parties had agreed that credits were the exclusive remedy.  See Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 106, Sec. 2-719(1)(b) (quoted in note 4 above).  More to the point, Esser's statement in context was not elicited by Sylvania to show that credits were the exclusive remedy, nor did Knapp cross-examine in order to refute such a suggestion, which after all Sylvania had not previously made.  Thus the parties did not litigate the limitation of remedies issue in the liability phase of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was the issue litigated in the damages phase.  Although in this phase the magistrate judge adverted to the limitation of remedies issue, his brief remarks suggest not that it was now open to litigation but rather that the parties either had or should have addressed the issue in the liability phase of the trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  One can argue as to whether the limitation of remedies issue is better described as a liability or a damage issue.  But in this case, the issue was not litigated in the former phase and it would have taken a fortune teller to suppose that such evidence would be welcomed in the latter phase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that Sylvania waived the limitation of remedies defense by failing to assert it in the answer or by amendment in accordance with Rule 8(c).  The defense was not resurrected either by clear notice given prior to trial or by actual litigation of the issue in the course of trial.  Thus the limitation of remedies defense is out of the case and cannot support the order vacating the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania argues that the order under review may, in the alternative, be upheld based on the magistrate judge's finding that only a very small percentage of the shoes manufactured by Sylvania for Knapp were defective.  If only a very small fraction of the shoes made by Sylvania for Knapp were defective, it might well follow that the damages claimed by Knapp were wildly excessive and that the injunction was no longer needed or ought to be reduced in amount.  After all, practically all of the types of damage claimed in Knapp's complaint (and recited above) depend as a practical matter on the premise that a large percentage of the shoes were defective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But in this case we have no way to review or sustain the critical determinations--that the defective shoes were a very small quantity--about three percent--because there are no supporting findings by the magistrate judge.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) requires that \"in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court shall ... set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action.\"   This requirement, which also attaches to the court's own final decision in a jury waived trial, id., but not to most other rulings, id., reflects the importance of injunctions and of providing an adequate basis for their appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania argues that Rule 52(a) is not applicable to this case because the rule, by its terms, applies only to decisions \"granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions.\"   Although there is some general support for Sylvania's position, see Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co. v. Chicago R. &amp; I.R. Co., 170 F.2d 654, 659 (7th Cir.1948), cert. denied, 336 U.S. 944, 69 S.Ct. 811, 93 L.Ed. 1101 (1949);  Munoz v. Porto Rico Ry. Light &amp; Power Co., 83 F.2d 262, 270 (1st Cir.)  (construing Equity Rule 70 1/2, the precursor of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)), cert. denied, 298 U.S. 689, 56 S.Ct. 955, 80 L.Ed. 1408 (1936), both the cases cited involved the district court's refusal to dissolve a preliminary injunction.  We agree that where a court made adequate findings when granting the preliminary injunction in the first place, it need not restate those findings in order to maintain the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decision to vacate an existing preliminary injunction is quite another matter.  It is not only a substantial change in the status quo but is the effective equivalent of a denial of a preliminary injunction, an event that unquestionably triggers Rule 52(a)'s requirement of findings.  We do not think that it stretches Rule 52(a) unduly to apply it to an order vacating a preliminary injunction.  But the need for findings in such a case is so strong that we would impose the findings requirement ourselves if we thought that Rule 52(a) had left an inadvertent loophole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given our conclusion that Rule 52(a) findings were required, we cannot sustain the order vacating the injunction in this case on the alternative ground offered by Sylvania, namely, the small percentage of defective shoes.  The magistrate judge did not rely at all on Sylvania's alternative ground.  Instead, in a footnote sentence at the close of the certification, the magistrate judge observed in explaining the questions being certified:  \"[T]he plaintiff has shown that three (3) per cent of the shoes were allegedly defective.\"   We do not think that this sentence is sufficient for purposes of Rule 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the case law lays down few clear rules as to what is adequate compliance with Rule 52(a).  We have said that \"conclusory findings\" are not enough, Thermo Electron Corp. v. Schiavone Construction Co., 915 F.2d 770, 773 (1st Cir.1990), but also that \"the 'judge need only make brief, definite, pertinent findings and conclusions upon the contested matters;  there is no necessity for over-elaboration of detail or particularization of facts.' \"  Applewood Landscape &amp; Nursery Co. v. Hollingsworth, 884 F.2d 1502, 1503 (1st Cir.1989).  The difficulty in devising a yardstick is not surprising when one considers the great diversity of disputes governed by the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the abstract, one might or might not describe as \"conclusory\" a magistrate judge's statement that the shoes delivered by Sylvania to Knapp had a defect rate of about three percent:  the statement is specific and concrete, but unexplained.  In truth, pinning a label like \"ultimate\" or \"conclusory\" on a single sentence is not very helpful;  Rule 52(a) calls for a level of detail adequate to permit appellate review on factual issues, and what is adequate depends on the importance of an issue, its complexity, the depth and nature of evidence presented, and similar elements that vary from case to case.  See generally Kelley v. Everglades Drainage District, 319 U.S. 415, 420, 63 S.Ct. 1141, 1144, 87 L.Ed. 1485 (1943).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the percentage of defects is critically important.  Of course, the magistrate judge could not know that his own basis for dissolving the injunction would be set aside and that Sylvania would rely on the percentage finding to support the dissolution order.  But to the extent that the three percent finding is proffered by Sylvania as a foundation for the dissolution order, it must meet the test of Rule 52(a).  For this purpose, the importance of the issue requires more rather than less detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case there is no detail whatever.  We do not know how the magistrate judge defined \"defect,\" a disputed issue at trial, nor how he arrived at the three percent figure, nor how he handled Knapp's claim that the percentage of shoes actually returned to Sylvania greatly understated the percentage of defects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On all of these issues there is no indication as to why certain witnesses were credited, what data was used or how it was construed, or why competing evidence was rejected.  We are thus unable to make a reasoned judgment whether, on this critical issue of defects, the magistrate judge's finding was or was not \"clearly erroneous.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairness to the magistrate judge, we note that he did not make the \"approximately three (3) per cent\" finding either to support a final determination of damages (which has not yet occurred) or to support dissolution of the preliminary injunction (it is Sylvania who is trying to make the finding play that role).  Rather the footnote finding was made to flesh out a hypothetical statement in the body of the certification.  There is no requirement for Rule 52(a) findings in certifying a legal question to a state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial in this case concluded on November 25, 1991, a year and a half before entry of the interlocutory order that forms the basis of this appeal and over two years prior to the present decision.  We see little point in remanding this case for further findings with respect to the district court's order dissolving the preliminary injunction.  In our view, the energies of both the court and the litigants would be more fruitfully directed toward a final resolution of this case on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania is, of course, free to file a new motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction.  But unless it can show some urgent need for the release of the funds, we would expect the magistrate judge to refuse summarily to revisit the preliminary injunction until the final decision is issued.  Knapp's case was once thought to have enough merit to justify an injunction;  as yet there are no supported findings that warrant a reappraisal of potential damages;  and Sylvania is apparently in the process of distributing all of its unencumbered assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the certification, it relates only to the limited issue of attorney's fees under chapter 93A.  Possibly the Supreme Judicial Court will have answered the questions posed by the time the magistrate judge is ready to issue his decision on the merits.  If not, the magistrate judge may think that the wiser course, in litigation that has otherwise been ripe for resolution at least since March 1992, is to decide the whole case and make his best conjecture on the chapter 93A issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final issue remains.  In the order vacating the preliminary injunction, the magistrate judge also dissolved the attachment on trustee process.  An attachment on trustee process is an interim remedy that was used here to prevent certain persons owing funds to Sylvania from disbursing them to Sylvania, in effect protecting funds that might be used to satisfy a judgment for Knapp.  See Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 246, Sec. 1;  Fed.R.Civ.P. 64;  Mass.R.Civ.P. 4.2.  Our stay pending review kept both the injunction and the attachment in effect until disposition of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania argues that the dissolution of the attachment is not equivalent to the dissolution of a preliminary injunction and is not an appealable event.  Knapp argues that the attachment is appealable, citing Teradyne, Inc. v. Mostek Corp., 797 F.2d 43, 44-47 (1st Cir.1986), but we see no reason to resolve this issue.  The magistrate judge's rationale for dissolving both the injunction and the attachment was the same.  As we have found that rationale to constitute legal error, we assume that the magistrate judge will on his own motion maintain the attachment in force unless and until there is a proper basis for modifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania says that the funds under the attachment have been earning no interest for two years.  If the funds are unequivocally owing to Sylvania, there should be an easy means for dealing with this problem (e.g., by an arrangement transferring the funds to an interest bearing account subject to the attachment).  Nothing in this opinion prevents Sylvania from applying to the magistrate judge for a modification of the attachment to address this or any other problem pertaining to the attachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's order dissolving the preliminary injunction is vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Chapter 93A outlaws \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"   Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 93A, Sec. 2(a), and it permits awards of multiple damages and attorney's fees.

That injunction had frozen assets of the defendant, Sylvania Shoe Manufacturing Corp., in an amount sufficient to satisfy a potential judgment in Knapp's favor.  Because we find that the primary ground of the court's order is a defense that was waived by Sylvania, and that the court's findings were insufficient to support its action on the alternative ground urged by Sylvania, we vacate the order dissolving the preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knapp sells work shoes at both the wholesale and retail levels, including a line of shoes with a patented slip-resistant rubber sole.  Beginning in 1986 or 1987, Knapp placed orders with Sylvania for the latter to manufacture and supply Knapp with several different styles of shoes incorporating Knapp's slip-resistant sole.  Knapp intended to resell the shoes both through its retail outlets and directly to large customers in the restaurant, hotel and other industries.  Between 1987 and 1989, Sylvania manufactured and delivered over 250,000 pairs of shoes to Knapp.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in 1987, Knapp became concerned about the quality of the shoes manufactured by Sylvania.  The primary problem was the tendency of the sole to separate from the leather body of the shoe.  Although the parties disagreed (both then and now) as to the extent of the problem, Sylvania made a number of changes in construction of the shoes in order to eliminate the problem.  According to its later complaint, Knapp was assured by Sylvania on various occasions between 1987 and 1989 that the sole adhesion problem had been remedied.  These assurances, Knapp asserts, were untrue;  it says that the proportion of defects remained high and in some periods approached 100% for certain styles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 10, 1990, Knapp filed this diversity action under Massachusetts law for breach of contract (count 1), breach of express warranty and implied warranties of merchantability and fitness (counts 2-4), breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing (count 5), fraud and negligent misrepresentation (counts 6 and 7), and violation of Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 93A (count 8).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The gravamen of all these claims was that too many of the shoes manufactured by Sylvania and sold to Knapp were defective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knapp's complaint was quite detailed in setting forth the categories of damages it claimed to have suffered.  These included increased costs of inspection and for handling and returning defective shoes;  lost profits due to Knapp's inability to fill orders for customers;  losses due to Sylvania's refusal to give credit for certain shoes that Knapp did return or attempted to return;  increased costs because Knapp was forced to make substitute purchases from other manufacturers; credits and price concessions Knapp had to afford its own customers because of their dissatisfaction with defective shoes;  and losses in good will and in customer orders due to Sylvania's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania filed an answer and counterclaim.  The answer denied virtually all of the incriminating allegations.  It also asserted 13 affirmative defenses, including estoppel, disclaimer of warranties, unclean hands, laches and contributory negligence.  Sylvania's counterclaim alleged that Knapp still owed Sylvania about $277,000 for shoe orders not yet paid (Sylvania also claimed multiple damages and attorney's fees under Chapter 93A).  The counterclaim suggested that any defects were due to Knapp's own specification of materials to be used in manufacturing its shoes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge and waived a jury trial.  The trial was bifurcated, with the liability phase covering nine trial days in January 1991.  At the conclusion of this phase, the magistrate judge on January 31, 1991, entered a four-page memorandum and order that devoted one paragraph each to five of Knapp's eight counts, without discussing Sylvania's counterclaim.  The first substantive paragraph reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except to the extent that plaintiff has shown, or can show, that shoes manufactured by defendant and delivered to plaintiff, and/or shoes manufactured by defendant to be delivered to plaintiff, were, in fact, defective, plaintiff has failed to satisfy this court by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant breached an express warranty.  None of the parties anticipated, or could, in the circumstances, reasonably anticipate, that each and every shoe manufactured by defendant for the plaintiff would be free of defect.  On its part, defendant expressly promised that it would use its best effort to produce a defect-free shoe, and that it would credit plaintiff's account for those defective shoes which plaintiff returned.  All parties clearly understood that that was the extent of the express warranty, nothing more, and nothing less.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the subsequent paragraphs, the magistrate judge found that Knapp had failed to prove fraud, negligent misrepresentation or--\"except to the extent that plaintiff has shown, or can show,\" a refusal by Sylvania to credit returned defective shoes--breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.  As for Knapp's chapter 93A claim, the order said that Sylvania had not been shown to have engaged in conduct so unscrupulous as to make it liable for multiple damages;  it noted, but did not decide, the question whether attorney's fees might be due Knapp under chapter 93A on the theory that a breach of warranty was a violation of chapter 93A under a regulation of the state's attorney general.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1991, prior to the damages phase of trial, Knapp discovered that Sylvania was going out of business and liquidating its assets.  Fearful that Sylvania would soon be judgment-proof, Knapp obtained a temporary restraining order precluding Sylvania from dissipating assets in the amount of $3,775,657.22--the amount of damages that Knapp hoped to prove in the next phase of the trial.  The magistrate judge modified this order on June 10, 1991, converting it into a preliminary injunction and amending it to allow Sylvania to make limited payments to its creditors and lawyers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The damages phase of trial took place over five days in June 1991;  at Sylvania's behest, an additional day of evidence was heard on November 25, 1991.  Proposed findings were filed by both sides in March 1992.  It appears that nothing further occurred during the next 12 months until, in March 1993, the magistrate judge issued an order proposing to certify certain questions to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.  Both sides opposed certification, but on April 8, 1993, the magistrate judge certified two questions to the Supreme Judicial Court;  both related to the possible application of Chapter 93A to \"a simple breach of warranty.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the certification, the magistrate judge prefaced the two certified questions with a ten-page statement.  The statement repeated the magistrate judge's rulings on the five counts discussed in its January 31, 1991, order, and then made several additional findings of fact and conclusions of law.  These determinations were prefaced by a statement that \"only the ultimate findings and conclusions are set forth herein--not the subsidiary findings and conclusions.\"   The magistrate judge determined inter alia that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. ....  By their express negotiations, by their express understandings, and by their express course of dealings, Sylvania promised Knapp that, in the event that shoes were defectively manufactured, Knapp's remedy, and sole remedy, would be the replacement of [or credit for] those shoes shown to be defective and returned--nothing more, and nothing less [footnote omitted].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Because of this clear and express understanding between the respective parties, Knapp's sole remedies, in terms of breach of contract, or under the relevant provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, are limited to the replacement of [or credit for] those shoes shown to be defective and returned to Sylvania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other determinations included a ruling that Sylvania was obliged to give a credit for or replace any defective shoes returned by Knapp;  a statement that many of the shoes returned by Knapp's customers were made by an overseas supplier;  a finding that Sylvania acted in \"the utmost good faith\" to correct a problem \"not reasonably foreseen\" by either side;  and a finding in a final footnote that \"at best ... approximately three (3) percent of the shoes were allegedly defective ... and as to a majority of those shoes, credit was given to Knapp when those shoes were returned....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court has yet to act on the questions certified by the district court.  But on the strength of the magistrate judge's findings in the certification order, Sylvania moved on April 8, 1993, to dissolve the preliminary injunction.  The magistrate judge granted this motion on May 5, 1993, concluding that its earlier findings left Knapp with so little hope of substantial recovery that the freeze on Sylvania's assets could no longer be justified.  The order set forth findings 1 and 2 from the certification, quoted in pertinent part above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knapp filed a notice of appeal on May 11, 1993, and this court stayed the magistrate judge's order dissolving the preliminary injunction pending the outcome of this appeal.  We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1), which permits appeals from interlocutory orders dissolving injunctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has not explicitly addressed the standard to be applied by a district court in deciding whether to dissolve a preliminary injunction.  But we think it evident that in the ordinary case dissolution should depend on the same considerations that guide a judge in deciding whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction in the first place.  The familiar quartet includes likelihood of success, the threat of irreparable injury to the party seeking interim relief, the equities and the public interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  It is not surprising that a fresh look after the trial evidence is in might produce a different judgment about the probability of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dissolving the preliminary injunction in this case, the magistrate judge relied upon his certification findings that the parties had agreed to limit their remedies under the contract to return and replacement or credit for defective shoes.  As already noted, the magistrate judge concluded in finding number 1 that \"[b]y their express negotiations, by their express understandings, and by their express course of dealings, Sylvania promised Knapp that, in the event that shoes were defectively manufactured, Knapp's remedy, and sole remedy, would be the replacement of [or credit for] those shoes shown to be defective and returned--nothing more, and nothing less.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the magistrate judge held that Knapp's claims for damages, see Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 106, Sec. 2-715 (buyer's ordinary damages), Sec. 7-16 (incidental and consequential damages), over and above credits for shoes actually returned to Sylvania, were barred by Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 106, Sec. 2-719;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  hence, Knapp's likelihood of substantial recovery was insufficient to support the preliminary injunction.  We need not decide whether a section 2-719 defense was supported by the evidence, because we hold that Sylvania waived any such limitation of remedies defense by failing to raise it in a timely fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c) requires a party to affirmatively plead certain specified defenses, as well as \"any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\"   Affirmative defenses not so pleaded are waived.  See FDIC v. Ramirez-Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519492\"><a href=\"/opinion/519492/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-juan-jesus-ramirez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 626 (1st Cir.1989).  We have previously held that a statutory provision limiting damages to a fixed sum constituted an affirmative defense for purposes of Rule 8(c).  Jakobsen v. Massachusetts Port Authority, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"329331\"><a href=\"/opinion/329331/kai-jakobsen-v-massachusetts-port-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span>, 813 (1st Cir.1975).  Section 2-719 performs the same damage limitation function, and there is no reason to reach a contrary result here.  See also Ingraham v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481350\"><a href=\"/opinion/481350/dwight-l-ingraham-v-united-states-of-america-jocelyn-bonds-etc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span>, 1079 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania failed to raise the defense in its answer, its amended answer, its pretrial memorandum, or its proposed jury instructions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Indeed, there is no indication that either of the parties thought that a limitation of remedies issue was present in the case until the ninth and final day of the liability phase of trial.  At that point, after all of the evidence had been submitted, the magistrate judge said \"[w]e've got a problem, I think under Section 719(b) of whether or not ... the parties agreed that defective returns, credits for [sic] would be the sole remedy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania does not dispute that the limitation of remedies is an affirmative defense.  Nor does it suggest that it raised that defense in its answer or elsewhere.  Instead, Sylvania argues that the statement of the magistrate judge at the close of the liability stage, as well as later ones made by the magistrate judge in the damages phase, put plaintiffs on notice as to the issue.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason why affirmative defenses under Rule 8(c) must be pled in the answer is to give the opposing party notice of the defense and a chance to develop evidence and offer arguments to controvert the defense.  Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108330\"><a href=\"/opinion/108330/blonder-tongue-laboratories-inc-v-university-of-ill-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 350, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108330\"><a href=\"/opinion/108330/blonder-tongue-laboratories-inc-v-university-of-ill-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span> (1971).  Some courts have excused noncompliance with Rule 8(c) if \"a plaintiff receives notice of an affirmative defense by some means other than pleadings\" and is not prejudiced by the omission of the defense from the initial pleading.  E.g., Moore, Owen, Thomas &amp; Co. v. Coffey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606343\"><a href=\"/opinion/606343/moore-owen-thomas-company-v-l-coleman-coffey-and-robert-bruce-coffey/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></a></span>, 1445 (6th Cir.1993).  This court reached the same result where a defense \"has been fully tried under the express or implied consent of the parties, as if it had been raised in the original responsive pleading.\"  Ramirez-Rivera, 869 F.2d at 626-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether notice and no prejudice would also serve as an excuse in this circuit, cf. Jakobsen, 520 F.2d at 813 (referring favorably to the no-prejudice test), since we find that neither the Coffey nor the Ramirez-Rivera standard was met here.  In the present case, the limitation of remedies issue was not raised until virtually the end of the liability trial, after discovery and the submission of all of the evidence on liability.  Nor did the parties' presentation of witnesses or documents focus on this issue.  Rather, the magistrate judge's ruling seems to have derived from a fragment of testimony from one witness:  a former Knapp executive named John Esser testified that he had told the Knapp president in July 1989 that Sylvania \"[had] agreed and will agree, if we do have a claim, to take back any shoes, and always have.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is pretty thin stuff, even coupled with evidence from other sources that the parties had extensive arrangements for the return of defective goods in exchange for credit.  The question, after all, is not whether credits were an available remedy but whether the parties had agreed that credits were the exclusive remedy.  See Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 106, Sec. 2-719(1)(b) (quoted in note 4 above).  More to the point, Esser's statement in context was not elicited by Sylvania to show that credits were the exclusive remedy, nor did Knapp cross-examine in order to refute such a suggestion, which after all Sylvania had not previously made.  Thus the parties did not litigate the limitation of remedies issue in the liability phase of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was the issue litigated in the damages phase.  Although in this phase the magistrate judge adverted to the limitation of remedies issue, his brief remarks suggest not that it was now open to litigation but rather that the parties either had or should have addressed the issue in the liability phase of the trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  One can argue as to whether the limitation of remedies issue is better described as a liability or a damage issue.  But in this case, the issue was not litigated in the former phase and it would have taken a fortune teller to suppose that such evidence would be welcomed in the latter phase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that Sylvania waived the limitation of remedies defense by failing to assert it in the answer or by amendment in accordance with Rule 8(c).  The defense was not resurrected either by clear notice given prior to trial or by actual litigation of the issue in the course of trial.  Thus the limitation of remedies defense is out of the case and cannot support the order vacating the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania argues that the order under review may, in the alternative, be upheld based on the magistrate judge's finding that only a very small percentage of the shoes manufactured by Sylvania for Knapp were defective.  If only a very small fraction of the shoes made by Sylvania for Knapp were defective, it might well follow that the damages claimed by Knapp were wildly excessive and that the injunction was no longer needed or ought to be reduced in amount.  After all, practically all of the types of damage claimed in Knapp's complaint (and recited above) depend as a practical matter on the premise that a large percentage of the shoes were defective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But in this case we have no way to review or sustain the critical determinations--that the defective shoes were a very small quantity--about three percent--because there are no supporting findings by the magistrate judge.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) requires that \"in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court shall ... set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action.\"   This requirement, which also attaches to the court's own final decision in a jury waived trial, id., but not to most other rulings, id., reflects the importance of injunctions and of providing an adequate basis for their appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania argues that Rule 52(a) is not applicable to this case because the rule, by its terms, applies only to decisions \"granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions.\"   Although there is some general support for Sylvania's position, see Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co. v. Chicago R. &amp; I.R.

(construing Equity Rule 70 1/2, the precursor of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1408</span></span> (1936), both the cases cited involved the district court's refusal to dissolve a preliminary injunction.  We agree that where a court made adequate findings when granting the preliminary injunction in the first place, it need not restate those findings in order to maintain the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decision to vacate an existing preliminary injunction is quite another matter.  It is not only a substantial change in the status quo but is the effective equivalent of a denial of a preliminary injunction, an event that unquestionably triggers Rule 52(a)'s requirement of findings.  We do not think that it stretches Rule 52(a) unduly to apply it to an order vacating a preliminary injunction.  But the need for findings in such a case is so strong that we would impose the findings requirement ourselves if we thought that Rule 52(a) had left an inadvertent loophole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given our conclusion that Rule 52(a) findings were required, we cannot sustain the order vacating the injunction in this case on the alternative ground offered by Sylvania, namely, the small percentage of defective shoes.  The magistrate judge did not rely at all on Sylvania's alternative ground.  Instead, in a footnote sentence at the close of the certification, the magistrate judge observed in explaining the questions being certified:  \"[T]he plaintiff has shown that three (3) per cent of the shoes were allegedly defective.\"   We do not think that this sentence is sufficient for purposes of Rule 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the case law lays down few clear rules as to what is adequate compliance with Rule 52(a).  We have said that \"conclusory findings\" are not enough, Thermo Electron Corp. v. Schiavone Construction Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548930\"><a href=\"/opinion/548930/thermo-electron-corporation-v-schiavone-construction-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>, 773 (1st Cir.1990), but also that \"the 'judge need only make brief, definite, pertinent findings and conclusions upon the contested matters;  there is no necessity for over-elaboration of detail or particularization of facts.' \"  Applewood Landscape &amp; Nursery Co. v. Hollingsworth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529277\"><a href=\"/opinion/529277/applewood-landscape-nursery-co-inc-v-wayne-b-hollingsworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></a></span>, 1503 (1st Cir.1989).  The difficulty in devising a yardstick is not surprising when one considers the great diversity of disputes governed by the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the abstract, one might or might not describe as \"conclusory\" a magistrate judge's statement that the shoes delivered by Sylvania to Knapp had a defect rate of about three percent:  the statement is specific and concrete, but unexplained.  In truth, pinning a label like \"ultimate\" or \"conclusory\" on a single sentence is not very helpful;  Rule 52(a) calls for a level of detail adequate to permit appellate review on factual issues, and what is adequate depends on the importance of an issue, its complexity, the depth and nature of evidence presented, and similar elements that vary from case to case.  See generally Kelley v. Everglades Drainage District, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103848\"><a href=\"/opinion/103848/kelley-v-everglades-drainage-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 420, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></span>, 1144, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1485</span></span> (1943).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the percentage of defects is critically important.  Of course, the magistrate judge could not know that his own basis for dissolving the injunction would be set aside and that Sylvania would rely on the percentage finding to support the dissolution order.  But to the extent that the three percent finding is proffered by Sylvania as a foundation for the dissolution order, it must meet the test of Rule 52(a).  For this purpose, the importance of the issue requires more rather than less detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case there is no detail whatever.  We do not know how the magistrate judge defined \"defect,\" a disputed issue at trial, nor how he arrived at the three percent figure, nor how he handled Knapp's claim that the percentage of shoes actually returned to Sylvania greatly understated the percentage of defects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On all of these issues there is no indication as to why certain witnesses were credited, what data was used or how it was construed, or why competing evidence was rejected.  We are thus unable to make a reasoned judgment whether, on this critical issue of defects, the magistrate judge's finding was or was not \"clearly erroneous.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairness to the magistrate judge, we note that he did not make the \"approximately three (3) per cent\" finding either to support a final determination of damages (which has not yet occurred) or to support dissolution of the preliminary injunction (it is Sylvania who is trying to make the finding play that role).  Rather the footnote finding was made to flesh out a hypothetical statement in the body of the certification.  There is no requirement for Rule 52(a) findings in certifying a legal question to a state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial in this case concluded on November 25, 1991, a year and a half before entry of the interlocutory order that forms the basis of this appeal and over two years prior to the present decision.  We see little point in remanding this case for further findings with respect to the district court's order dissolving the preliminary injunction.  In our view, the energies of both the court and the litigants would be more fruitfully directed toward a final resolution of this case on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania is, of course, free to file a new motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction.  But unless it can show some urgent need for the release of the funds, we would expect the magistrate judge to refuse summarily to revisit the preliminary injunction until the final decision is issued.  Knapp's case was once thought to have enough merit to justify an injunction;  as yet there are no supported findings that warrant a reappraisal of potential damages;  and Sylvania is apparently in the process of distributing all of its unencumbered assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the certification, it relates only to the limited issue of attorney's fees under chapter 93A.  Possibly the Supreme Judicial Court will have answered the questions posed by the time the magistrate judge is ready to issue his decision on the merits.  If not, the magistrate judge may think that the wiser course, in litigation that has otherwise been ripe for resolution at least since March 1992, is to decide the whole case and make his best conjecture on the chapter 93A issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final issue remains.  In the order vacating the preliminary injunction, the magistrate judge also dissolved the attachment on trustee process.  An attachment on trustee process is an interim remedy that was used here to prevent certain persons owing funds to Sylvania from disbursing them to Sylvania, in effect protecting funds that might be used to satisfy a judgment for Knapp.  See Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 246, Sec. 1;  Fed.R.Civ.P. 64;  Mass.R.Civ.P. 4.2.  Our stay pending review kept both the injunction and the attachment in effect until disposition of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania argues that the dissolution of the attachment is not equivalent to the dissolution of a preliminary injunction and is not an appealable event.  Knapp argues that the attachment is appealable, citing Teradyne, Inc. v. Mostek Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474191\"><a href=\"/opinion/474191/teradyne-inc-v-mostek-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 44-47 (1st Cir.1986), but we see no reason to resolve this issue.  The magistrate judge's rationale for dissolving both the injunction and the attachment was the same.  As we have found that rationale to constitute legal error, we assume that the magistrate judge will on his own motion maintain the attachment in force unless and until there is a proper basis for modifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sylvania says that the funds under the attachment have been earning no interest for two years.  If the funds are unequivocally owing to Sylvania, there should be an easy means for dealing with this problem (e.g., by an arrangement transferring the funds to an interest bearing account subject to the attachment).  Nothing in this opinion prevents Sylvania from applying to the magistrate judge for a modification of the attachment to address this or any other problem pertaining to the attachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's order dissolving the preliminary injunction is vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Chapter 93A outlaws \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"   Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 93A, Sec. 2(a), and it permits awards of multiple damages and attorney's fees.
