The   Federal  Deposit\n                                     \n\nInsurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), as receiver of First Service Bank\n\n(\"Bank\"),  sued appellants,  Angeline Kopka  and David  Beach, to\n\ncollect on promissory  notes made  out to the  Bank.   Appellants\n\nresponded that they  did not owe the FDIC the  amount promised in\n\nthe  notes because  they had  entered settlement  agreements over\n\nthese notes  with the Bank before the FDIC took over as receiver.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of the FDIC,\n\nfinding  that the doctrine established in D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v.\n                                                              \n\nFDIC,  315 U.S.  447  (1942), and  12  U.S.C.    1823(e)  (1989),\n    \n\nforbids the assertion of this alleged agreement against the FDIC.\n\nIn addition,  the district court  granted attorney's fees  to the\n\nFDIC  pursuant  to provisions  of  appellants' promissory  notes.\n\nBecause  we agree that    1823(e) protects the  FDIC in this case\n\nand that  the district court granted a reasonable attorney's fees\n\naward, we affirm the district court's judgment.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Appellants  borrowed money from  the Bank  and executed\n\npromissory notes in  the amount of the loans.   The notes matured\n\nin May  and June of 1989.  Appellants contend that they reached a\n\nsettlement  of these loans on March 15, 19891 which required them\n\nto  convey to  the  Bank  the  real  estate  that  secured  their\n\npromissory notes, free of all liens.\n\n                    \n\n1  Although appellants name December 21, 1988 as their settlement\ndate,  they  maintain  that  the  Bank  refused  to  fulfill  the\nagreement,  forcing them to bring suit in the Hillsborough County\nSuperior Court, which the court dismissed without prejudice on an\nunrelated ground.   Consequently, they argue, they  entered a new\nsettlement agreement on March 15, 1989.\n\n          On March 31,  1989, the Commissioner  of Banks for  the\n\nCommonwealth  of Massachusetts  declared the  Bank insolvent  and\n\nappointed  the FDIC as receiver.2  As receiver, the FDIC demanded\n\npayment of all debts owed  to the Bank when the Bank  failed.  No\n\nevidence of appellants' alleged settlement agreement was found in\n\nthe Bank's  records.  As such,  on March 3, 1991, as  part of its\n\ndebt  collection  campaign,  the  FDIC  sued  appellants  on  the\n\npromissory  notes.    Appellants  argued  that  their  settlement\n\nagreement with the Bank binds the FDIC as receiver and  that they\n\ntherefore do not owe the FDIC the amount claimed.   The FDIC then\n\nmoved for summary  judgment, arguing that under  D'Oench, Duhme &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nCo.  and 12 U.S.C.   1823(e), any  unwritten agreement alleged by\n   \n\nappellants cannot bind  the FDIC.   The district court  initially\n\ndenied the motion but granted it upon reconsideration.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nI.  SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n          Summary judgments receive  plenary review  in which  we\n\nread  the record  and indulge  all inferences  in the  light most\n\nfavorable to  the non-moving party.   E.H. Ashley &amp; Co.  v. Wells\n                                                                 \n\nFargo Alarm Services, 907 F.2d 1274, 1277 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                    \n\nII.  THE D'OENCH DOCTRINE AND 12 U.S.C.   1823(e) (1989)\n                \n\n          Under  D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co.,  315 U.S. at  460, a party\n                                     \n\nmay not  defend against a claim  by the FDIC for  collection on a\n\npromissory note based on an agreement that is not memorialized in\n\n                    \n\n2   Massachusetts uses the  term \"liquidating  agent\" instead  of\nreceiver.   According to 12 U.S.C.   1813(j) (1989), however, the\nterm \"receiver\" includes liquidating agents.\n\n                               -3-\n\nsome  fashion in the failed bank's records.3  The parties' reason\n\nfor failing to  exhibit the  agreement in the  bank's records  is\n\nirrelevant,  as is the FDIC's actual  knowledge of the agreement.\n\nTimberland  Design, Inc. v. First  Serv. Bank for  Sav., 932 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n46, 48-50 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          Congress embraced  the D'Oench  doctrine  in 12  U.S.C.\n                                        \n\n  1823(e).  Bateman v. FDIC,  970 F.2d 924, 926 (1st  Cir. 1992).\n                           \n\nSection 1823(e)  requires any  agreement that would  diminish the\n\nFDIC's interest in an asset acquired as receiver to be in writing\n\nand executed by the failed bank.4\n\n                    \n\n3   Although  D'Oench, Duhme  &amp; Co.  dealt with  the FDIC  in its\n                                   \ncorporate capacity, the D'Oench doctrine equally applies in cases\n                               \ninvolving the FDIC as  receiver.  See Timberland Design,  Inc. v.\n                                                              \nFirst Serv. Bank for Sav., 932 F.2d 46, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                         \n\n4  Section 1823(e) provides:\n\n          No  agreement  which  tends  to  diminish  or\n          defeat  the interest  of  the  [FDIC] in  any\n          asset  acquired by  it . . .  as  receiver of\n          any insured depository institution,  shall be\n          valid   against   the   [FDIC]  unless   such\n          agreement -\n\n            (1) is in writing,\n\n            (2)  was  executed   by  the   depository\n            institution  and  any person  claiming an\n            adverse  interest  thereunder,  including\n            the  obligor, contemporaneously  with the\n            acquisition   of   the   asset   by   the\n            depository institution,\n\n            (3)   was  approved   by  the   board  of\n            directors  of the  depository institution\n            or its loan committee . . ., and\n\n            (4) has been, continuously, from the time\n            of  its execution, an  official record of\n            the depository institution.\n\n                               -4-\n\n          Appellants concede that no writing executed by the Bank\n\nexists.  Appellants argue, however, that   1823(e) does not apply\n\nto  this case for two  reasons.  First,  when Congress originally\n\nenacted    1823(e), the section applied  to the FDIC  only in its\n\ncorporate  capacity.    It was  not  until  August  of 1989  that\n\nCongress  amended    1823(e), through the  Financial Institutions\n\nReform,  Recovery,   and  Enforcement  Act  (\"FIRREA\"),  to  make\n\n  1823(e)  directly  applicable  to  the  FDIC  in  its  receiver\n\ncapacity.  Appellants argue that  since they reached a settlement\n\nwith the Bank on March 15, 1989,   1823(e) does not apply to this\n\ncase.\n\n          Second,  appellants argue  that  even if    1823(e), as\n\namended by FIRREA, applied to cases prior to August 1989, it does\n\nnot  reach the present case because the FDIC acquired no interest\n\nin the promissory  notes as  required by   1823(e).   We  address\n\nthese arguments in turn.\n\n          A.  Retroactivity of FIRREA\n\n          In  general, district  courts apply  the law  in effect\n\nwhen they  render their decisions, \"unless doing  so would result\n\nin  manifest  injustice  or   there  is  statutory  direction  or\n\nlegislative  history to the contrary.\"   Bradley v. Richmond Sch.\n                                                                 \n\nBd., 416 U.S.  696, 711  (1974).5   Since the  FDIC brought  this\n   \n\n                    \n\n5   In Kaiser Aluminum &amp;  Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno,  494 U.S. 827,\n                                                 \n836 (1990), the Supreme Court noted a tension between Bradley and\n                                                             \nBowen  v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988), which\n                                \nstated a  presumption against retroactivity.   However, the Court\ndeclined  to reconcile the cases.  Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp.,\n                                                                \n494 U.S. at 854.\n\n                               -5-\n\naction on March 3,  1991, almost two years after  the application\n\nof    1823(e) to  the FDIC  as receiver,    1823(e) presumptively\n\napplies to this case.\n\n          Thus,  we examine  the  two exceptions  to the  general\n\nrule.   First,  the statute  itself and  the legislative  history\n\noffer little  guidance as  to Congress'  intent  with respect  to\n\nretroactivity.   Under  Bradley, this  lack of  guidance supports\n                               \n\nretroactive application.   Bradley,  416 U.S. at  715-16 (stating\n                                  \n\nthat  when legislative  history  is  inconclusive, courts  should\n\napply the statute retroactively).\n\n          Second, to determine whether a manifest  injustice will\n\nresult from  the retroactive application  of a  statute, we  must\n\nbalance  the  disappointment of  private  expectations caused  by\n\nretroactive   application   against   the   public   interest  in\n\nenforcement of the statute.  Demars v. First Serv. Bank for Sav.,\n                                                                \n\n907  F.2d 1237,  1240  (1st Cir.  1990).   In  the present  case,\n\nappellants' disappointed expectations are small.   Appellants had\n\nnotice  that their agreement had  to meet certain  criteria to be\n\nvalid  against   the  FDIC.    The  D'Oench   doctrine  was  well\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n   The Seventh  and Eight  circuits have expressly  addressed the\nissue of retroactivity with respect to the substantive provisions\nof FIRREA.   Both of these circuits applied FIRREA retroactively.\nSee FDIC v. Wright, 942 F.2d 1089, 1095-97 (7th  Cir. 1991); FDIC\n                                                                 \nv.

We  find  no  prejudice in  this  application  because\nBradley permits  retroactive application only  where no  manifest\n       \ninjustice will result.  See FDIC v. Wright, 942 F.2d at 1095 n.6.\n                                          \n\n                               -6-\n\nestablished  when  appellants  were negotiating  with  the  Bank.\n\nAlthough  D'Oench,  Duhme &amp;  Co.  did  not explicitly  require  a\n                                \n\nwriting executed by the  Bank, it did require that  any agreement\n\nbe clearly documented in  the Bank's records to be  valid against\n\nthe FDIC.\n\n          In  addition, even  if  D'Oench, Duhme  &amp;  Co. did  not\n                                                        \n\nprovide  appellants  with  sufficient  notice  of  the  statute's\n\nrequirements, appellants' failure to  meet these requirements did\n\nnot result from reasonable reliance on the D'Oench doctrine.  See\n                                                                 \n\nVan Dorn Plastic  Machinery Co. v. NLRB,  939 F.2d 402,  404 (6th\n                                       \n\nCir.  1991)  (manifest  injustice  requires  parties'  reasonable\n\nreliance on preexisting law).   Appellants did all they  could to\n\nadvance settlement of the debt.  In fact, they sent the necessary\n\ndocuments, with their signatures, to the Bank for execution.  The\n\nBank,  however,   refused  to  sign  the   papers.    Appellants,\n\ntherefore, could have  done nothing  more to  satisfy either  the\n\nD'Oench or the statutory requirements.\n       \n\n          Finally, there is no  evidence that appellants made any\n\nattempt to  perform under  this  agreement during  the two  years\n\nbetween the time that appellants allegedly entered this agreement\n\nand the  time the FDIC filed  suit.  As such,  we cannot conclude\n\nthat appellants reasonably expected this agreement to shield them\n\nfrom liability on their notes.\n\n          On the other hand,    1823(e) promotes important public\n\npolicies.   Congress amended    1823(e), through FIRREA,  to \"aid\n\nthe  FDIC  in  its  immediate responsibilities  of  dealing  with\n\n                               -7-\n\nmounting bank failures  in this  country.\"  FDIC  v. Wright,  942\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 1089, 1096 (7th  Cir. 1991).  The FDIC cannot protect public\n\nfunds held  in  failed banks  unless it  can rely  on the  bank's\n\nrecords.  FDIC v. McCullough, 911 F.2d 593, 600 (11th Cir. 1990),\n                            \n\ncert. denied,  111 S. Ct. 2235  (1991).  Accordingly, we  find no\n            \n\nmanifest injustice, and we apply   1823(e), as amended by FIRREA,\n\nto the present case.\n\n          B.  Acquisition of the promissory notes \n\n          In  order to  receive protection  under    1823(e), the\n\nFDIC must first  acquire the  asset in question  from the  failed\n\nbank.  In FDIC v. Nemecek, 641 F. Supp. 740, 743 (D. Kan.  1986),\n                         \n\nthe district court found that the FDIC acquired no interest in  a\n\nbank's promissory note  because the parties reached an accord and\n\nsatisfaction  of  the  note  prior to  the  FDIC's  receivership.\n\nConsequently, the  court found that   1823(e) did not protect the\n\nFDIC  against   the  asserted  accord  and   satisfaction.    Id.\n                                                                \n\nAppellants argue  that  in the  present  case, their  notes  were\n\nsimilarly  extinguished by their  settlement agreement before the\n\nBank failed.\n\n          Even assuming  that we  agree with the  Kansas district\n\ncourt's interpretation  of    1823(e), however, Nemecek  does not\n                                                       \n\nassist appellants.   In Nemecek, the bank authorized its attorney\n                               \n\nto  enter into an accord and satisfaction with the promisors; the\n\nbank's attorney had already received the promisors' consideration\n\nbefore the bank failed; and the bank and the promisors considered\n\nthe case settled.\n\n                               -8-\n\n          In  the present  case,  nothing in  the bank's  records\n\nindicated that  the bank  authorized its  attorney to  accept the\n\nsettlement, and no consideration changed hands.  It  would render\n\n  1823(e) a  nullity to hold unwritten  agreements, without more,\n\nvalid against the FDIC as long as the parties reach the agreement\n\nbefore the FDIC  takes over.  Banks and debtors  would be able to\n\ndefraud the FDIC through secret agreements simply by reaching the\n\nagreement  before  the FDIC  took over.    This is  precisely the\n\nsituation that D'Oench and   1823(e) were intended to prevent.\n                      \n\n          Section 1823(e) precludes  appellants from binding  the\n\nFDIC to  their alleged  settlement.   Accordingly, we  affirm the\n\ndistrict  courts judgment with respect to the FDIC's claim on the\n\npromissory notes.6 \n\nIII.  ATTORNEYS FEES\n\n          We  review   the  district  court's   determination  of\n\nattorney's  fees  only  for  abuse  of   discretion.    Nydam  v.\n                                                             \n\nLennerton,  948  F.2d 808,  812 (1st  Cir.  1991).   The district\n         \n\ncourt's order exhibits a careful review of the fees and expenses.\n\nIndeed, the  judge rejected  $5,182  of the  claimed expenses  as\n\nunreasonable.   In addition,  the fees amounted  to approximately\n\ntwo percent  of the total judgment.   We cannot find  an abuse of\n\ndiscretion in this award.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n6  Because we find  that   1823(e) applies in this case,  we need\nnot reach  the issue of  whether D'Oench Duhme  &amp; Co. would  have\n                                                     \nprotected the FDIC in this situation on its own.\n\n                               -9-\n",

The notes matured\n\nin May  and June of 1989.  Appellants contend that they reached a\n\nsettlement  of these loans on March 15, 19891 which required them\n\nto  convey to  the  Bank  the  real  estate  that  secured  their\n\npromissory notes, free of all liens.\n\n                    \n\n1  Although appellants name December 21, 1988 as their settlement\ndate,  they  maintain  that  the  Bank  refused  to  fulfill  the\nagreement,  forcing them to bring suit in the Hillsborough County\nSuperior Court, which the court dismissed without prejudice on an\nunrelated ground.   Consequently, they argue, they  entered a new\nsettlement agreement on March 15, 1989.\n\n          On March 31,  1989, the Commissioner  of Banks for  the\n\nCommonwealth  of Massachusetts  declared the  Bank insolvent  and\n\nappointed  the FDIC as receiver.2  As receiver, the FDIC demanded\n\npayment of all debts owed  to the Bank when the Bank  failed.  No\n\nevidence of appellants' alleged settlement agreement was found in\n\nthe Bank's  records.  As such,  on March 3, 1991, as  part of its\n\ndebt  collection  campaign,  the  FDIC  sued  appellants  on  the\n\npromissory  notes.    Appellants  argued  that  their  settlement\n\nagreement with the Bank binds the FDIC as receiver and  that they\n\ntherefore do not owe the FDIC the amount claimed.   The FDIC then\n\nmoved for summary  judgment, arguing that under  D'Oench, Duhme &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nCo.  and 12 U.S.C.   1823(e), any  unwritten agreement alleged by\n   \n\nappellants cannot bind  the FDIC.   The district court  initially\n\ndenied the motion but granted it upon reconsideration.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nI.

Appellants argue, however, that   1823(e) does not apply\n\nto  this case for two  reasons.  First,  when Congress originally\n\nenacted    1823(e), the section applied  to the FDIC  only in its\n\ncorporate  capacity.    It was  not  until  August  of 1989  that\n\nCongress  amended    1823(e), through the  Financial Institutions\n\nReform,  Recovery,   and  Enforcement  Act  (\"FIRREA\"),  to  make\n\n  1823(e)  directly  applicable  to  the  FDIC  in  its  receiver\n\ncapacity.  Appellants argue that  since they reached a settlement\n\nwith the Bank on March 15, 1989,   1823(e) does not apply to this\n\ncase.\n\n          Second,  appellants argue  that  even if    1823(e), as\n\namended by FIRREA, applied to cases prior to August 1989, it does\n\nnot  reach the present case because the FDIC acquired no interest\n\nin the promissory  notes as  required by   1823(e).   We  address\n\nthese arguments in turn.\n\n          A.

First,  the statute  itself and  the legislative  history\n\noffer little  guidance as  to Congress'  intent  with respect  to\n\nretroactivity.   Under  Bradley, this  lack of  guidance supports\n                               \n\nretroactive application.   Bradley,  416 U.S. at  715-16 (stating\n                                  \n\nthat  when legislative  history  is  inconclusive, courts  should\n\napply the statute retroactively).\n\n          Second, to determine whether a manifest  injustice will\n\nresult from  the retroactive application  of a  statute, we  must\n\nbalance  the  disappointment of  private  expectations caused  by\n\nretroactive   application   against   the   public   interest  in\n\nenforcement of the statute.

In  the present  case,\n\nappellants' disappointed expectations are small.   Appellants had\n\nnotice  that their agreement had  to meet certain  criteria to be\n\nvalid  against   the  FDIC.    The  D'Oench   doctrine  was  well\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n   The Seventh  and Eight  circuits have expressly  addressed the\nissue of retroactivity with respect to the substantive provisions\nof FIRREA.

Appellants did all they  could to\n\nadvance settlement of the debt.  In fact, they sent the necessary\n\ndocuments, with their signatures, to the Bank for execution.  The\n\nBank,  however,   refused  to  sign  the   papers.

Acquisition of the promissory notes \n\n          In  order to  receive protection  under    1823(e), the\n\nFDIC must first  acquire the  asset in question  from the  failed\n\nbank.  In FDIC v. Nemecek, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1483353\"><a href=\"/opinion/1483353/federal-deposit-ins-corp-v-nemecek/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Kan.  1986),\n                         \n\nthe district court found that the FDIC acquired no interest in  a\n\nbank's promissory note  because the parties reached an accord and\n\nsatisfaction  of  the  note  prior to  the  FDIC's  receivership.\n\nConsequently, the  court found that   1823(e) did not protect the\n\nFDIC  against   the  asserted  accord  and   satisfaction.    Id.\n                                                                \n\nAppellants argue  that  in the  present  case, their  notes  were\n\nsimilarly  extinguished by their  settlement agreement before the\n\nBank failed.\n\n          Even assuming  that we  agree with the  Kansas district\n\ncourt's interpretation  of    1823(e), however, Nemecek  does not\n                                                       \n\nassist appellants.   In Nemecek, the bank authorized its attorney\n                               \n\nto  enter into an accord and satisfaction with the promisors; the\n\nbank's attorney had already received the promisors' consideration\n\nbefore the bank failed; and the bank and the promisors considered\n\nthe case settled.\n\n                               -8-\n\n          In  the present  case,  nothing in  the bank's  records\n\nindicated that  the bank  authorized its  attorney to  accept the\n\nsettlement, and no consideration changed hands.  It  would render\n\n  1823(e) a  nullity to hold unwritten  agreements, without more,\n\nvalid against the FDIC as long as the parties reach the agreement\n\nbefore the FDIC  takes over.  Banks and debtors  would be able to\n\ndefraud the FDIC through secret agreements simply by reaching the\n\nagreement  before  the FDIC  took over.    This is  precisely the\n\nsituation that D'Oench and   1823(e) were intended to prevent.\n                      \n\n          Section 1823(e) precludes  appellants from binding  the\n\nFDIC to  their alleged  settlement.   Accordingly, we  affirm the\n\ndistrict  courts judgment with respect to the FDIC's claim on the\n\npromissory notes.6 \n\nIII.  ATTORNEYS FEES\n\n          We  review   the  district  court's   determination  of\n\nattorney's  fees  only  for  abuse  of   discretion.

The district\n         \n\ncourt's order exhibits a careful review of the fees and expenses.\n\nIndeed, the  judge rejected  $5,182  of the  claimed expenses  as\n\nunreasonable.   In addition,  the fees amounted  to approximately\n\ntwo percent  of the total judgment.   We cannot find  an abuse of\n\ndiscretion in this award.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n6  Because we find  that   1823(e) applies in this case,  we need\nnot reach  the issue of  whether D'Oench Duhme  &amp; Co. would  have\n                                                     \nprotected the FDIC in this situation on its own.\n\n                               -9-\n</pre>",
