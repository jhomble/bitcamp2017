We\n\naffirm.\n\nA.  Probable Cause for Search Warrant\n                                     \n\n          On the morning of July 17, 1991, Robert Hutchings, Jr.,\n\na  special agent of  the Maine  Bureau of  Intergovernmental Drug\n\nEnforcement  (\"BIDE\"), spoke  with a  confidential  informant who\n\nreported that he  recently had visited  appellant Taylor and  her\n\nhusband  at property  in Levant,  Maine,  upon which  the Taylors\n\nresided in separate mobile homes.  The informant observed several\n\nlarge marijuana plants (up to 4 feet tall) growing in appellant's\n\nvegetable garden  and around  the perimeter  of her  mobile home,\n\nseveral hundred marijuana seedlings (5 to 6 inches  tall) growing\n\nin milk cartons and crates and awaiting transplantation to nearby\n\nwoods,  and an \"unusual amount\"  of zip lock  storage bags inside\n\nappellant's  residence.   During  one visit,  appellant told  the\n\ninformant she was  concerned because she  had started more  seed-\n\nlings than she could tend.\n\n          The same  day he received  the tip from  the informant,\n\nAgent Hutchings consulted the affidavit submitted in support of a\n\n1986 search warrant application, in which another officer attest-\n\ned that he had  purchased marijuana from Taylor on  two occasions\n\nand personally observed marijuana plants growing on her property.\n\nA local drug task force report noted that Taylor had pled  guilty\n\nto two counts of marijuana trafficking in October 1986.  Incorpo-\n\nrating  this evidence  into  an affidavit,  Hutchings obtained  a\n\nstate court  search warrant  which was  executed later that  day.\n\nAppellant ultimately  was charged  in the United  States District\n\nCourt for the District  of Maine with manufacturing marijuana  in\n\nviolation of federal law.\n\n          The district  court denied  appellant's motion  to sup-\n\npress the physical evidence  (marijuana plants and drug parapher-\n\nnalia) based on an  alleged absence of probable cause  to support\n\nthe  search warrant.   Appellant  contends that  Agent Hutchings'\n\nsworn statements  vouching for the  informant's reliability  were\n\nconclusory  and  that the  tips  provided by  the  informant were\n\ninadequately corroborated.\n\n          The  sufficiency  of  a  search  warrant  affidavit  is\n\nappraised against well-established criteria:\n\n          The task of the issuing  magistrate is simply\n          to  make  a practical,  common-sense decision\n          whether,  given  all  the  circumstances  set\n          forth in the affidavit before  him, including\n          the  \"veracity\" and  \"basis of  knowledge\" of\n          persons supplying  hearsay information, there\n          is  a  fair  probability  that  contraband or\n          evidence of a crime  will be found in  a par-\n          ticular place.   And the duty  of a reviewing\n          court is simply to ensure that the magistrate\n          had a \"substantial  basis for . . .  conclud-\n          [ing]\" that probable cause existed.\n\nUnited  States  v. Caggiano,  899 F.2d  99,  102 (1st  Cir. 1990)\n                           \n\n(quoting Illinois v.  Gates, 462 U.S. 213,  238-39 (1983)) (cita-\n                           \n\ntions omitted);  see also United  States v.  Ventresca, 380  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n102, 108 (1965).   The reviewing court does not undertake de novo\n                                                                 \n\n                                3\n\nreview,  but  accords \"great  deference\"  to  the probable  cause\n\ndetermination.  United  States v.  Ciampa, 793 F.2d  19, 22  (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1986) (citation omitted).\n\n          The Hutchings affidavit tersely attests that the infor-\n\nmant  \"has  provided  reliable  information  [to  law enforcement\n\nofficials]  in the past.\"  Standing alone, so conclusory a state-\n\nment might not provide  an issuing magistrate with  the requisite\n\n\"'substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.'\"\n\n Caggiano, 899 F.2d at  103 (quoting Gates, 462 U.S.  at 238-39).\n                                          \n\nOn the other hand, an informant's reliability need not invariably\n\nbe demonstrated  through a detailed narration  of the information\n\npreviously  furnished  to  law  enforcement     for  example,  by\n\nlisting the number or names of persons arrested or convicted as a\n\nconsequence  of the  informant's prior  assistance.   Rather, the\n\naffidavit  may  disclose an  adequate  basis  for evaluating  the\n\ninformant's veracity through the very specificity and detail with\n\nwhich it  relates the  informant's first-hand description  of the\n                                             \n\nplace  to be searched or  the items to be  seized.  Id. at 102-03\n                                                       \n\n(reliability  of information  enhanced  if details  derived  from\n\ninformant's  personal  observation,  rather  than  from  hearsay)\n\n(citing Ciampa, 793  F.2d at 24).  As was  the case in Caggiano,1\n                                                               \n\nthe informant  provided Agent Hutchings with  a detailed descrip-\n\ntion  of the premises to be searched, including the exteriors and\n\n                    \n\n     1In  Caggiano, the  informant  was a  former  drug user  who\n                  \nprovided  the names of occupants of the searched premises and the\nexact dates of  his visits.   He reported that he  observed fire-\narms,  as well as glassine bags containing white powder which the\ndefendant had said contained cocaine.  Caggiano, 899 F.2d at 101.\n                                               \n\n                                4\n\ninteriors of the Taylor residences, noting in particular the  400\n\nto  500 marijuana  seedlings  being raised  in  milk cartons  and\n\ncrates at appellant's residence.\n\n          Continuing  with  the \"totality  of  the circumstances\"\n\nanalysis mandated  by  Gates, we  find  no merit  in  appellant's\n                            \n\ncontention  that Hutchings conducted an inadequate or superficial\n\nfollow-up investigation of the informant's tip.  On the contrary,\n\nHutchings  promptly set out to corroborate the informant's tip by\n\nconsulting official records relating to appellant's prior convic-\n\ntions for  marijuana trafficking.   These records  indicated that\n\nappellant, five years earlier, admitted to another police officer\n\nthat she intentionally cultivated marijuana on the same property,\n\nand  later entered a guilty  plea to a  state trafficking charge.\n\nAn affiant's knowledge of the target's prior criminal activity or\n\nrecord clearly  is material to the  probable cause determination.\n\nSee United States v. Asselin, 775  F.2d 445, 446 (1st Cir. 1985);\n                            \n\nUnited  States v. Sumpter, 669  F.2d 1215, 1222  (8th Cir. 1982).\n                         \n\nMoreover, the issuing magistrate  properly may credit the experi-\n\nence and  pertinent expertise  of  a law  enforcement affiant  in\n\nevaluating the authenticity of the informant's description of the\n\ntarget's  modus operandi.  See  United States v.  Soule, 908 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1032,  1040 (1st Cir. 1990)  (citing United States  v. Ortiz, 422\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 891, 897 (1975) (\"[O]fficers are entitled to draw reasonable\n\ninferences from [] facts  in light of their knowledge of the area\n\nand their prior experience . . . .\")).  In  the present case, the\n\ninformant's  detailed description  of  the location,  manner  and\n\n                                5\n\nextent  of the marijuana cultivation and the presence on the same\n\npremises of an unusually  large number of zip lock  plastic bags,\n\ncf. United States v. Desmarais, 938 F.2d 347, 352 (1st Cir. 1991)\n                              \n\n(presence of  plastic  baggies supports  reasonable inference  of\n\nintent to distribute marijuana and hashish found  on same premis-\n\nes), combined with Agent Hutchings' extensive experience as a law\n\nenforcement officer  in Maine,2 plainly buttressed the informant-\n\nbased  indicia of probable cause.  We accordingly conclude, based\n\non the totality of the  circumstances, that the Hutchings affida-\n\nvit provided  a substantial basis for the  issuing judicial offi-\n\ncer's practical, common-sense finding that there was a fair prob-\n\nability  that evidence of a  crime would be  found on appellant's\n\npremises.\n\nB.  Admissibility of Pre-Miranda Admissions\n                                           \n\n          While  a  search  team  executed  the  warrant,   Agent\n\nHutchings arrested appellant and placed her in the back seat of a\n\npolice vehicle.   Hutchings testified that  he gave appellant  no\n\nMiranda  warnings because he did not intend  to ask her any ques-\n       \n\ntions.  At some point during  the trip to the county jail, appel-\n\nlant initiated conversation by asking:  \"Why is this happening to\n\nme?\"   Hutchings replied:   \"You  can't be  growing dope  on your\n\nproperty  like that.\"  Taylor responded:   \"If you had waited and\n\ncome next week, you'd have  only gotten half the plants  that you\n\n                    \n\n     2The  Hutchings  affidavit  fully recited  his  credentials,\nincluding his educational training and eleven years of experience\nin drug-related cases.\n\n                                6\n\ndid[,] the way you  do is you pull  the male plants early.\"   She\n\nadded  that she was growing the marijuana plants for treatment of\n\na medical condition.  As appellant was speaking, Hutchings turned\n\non  the overhead light in  the vehicle and,  without stopping the\n\nvehicle,  wrote appellant's statements  on a pad.   Later, during\n\n\"booking\"  at the  county jail, appellant  spontaneously repeated\n\nsome of these statements to a deputy sheriff.\n\n          Miranda  warnings must  be  given before  a suspect  is\n                 \n\nsubjected  to \"custodial  interrogation.\"   United States  v. Ma-\n                                                                 \n\nguire, 918 F.2d  254, 262 (1st Cir.  1990), cert. denied,  111 S.\n                                                        \n\nCt. 1421 (1991).3   \"Interrogation\" includes not  only the asking\n\nof direct questions  but also means \"any words  or actions on the\n\npart of police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and\n\ncustody)  that the police  should know  are reasonably  likely to\n                                                                 \n\nelicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\"  Rhode Island\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Innis, 446  U.S. 291,  301 (1980)  (emphasis added).4   Since\n         \n\nHutchings' response to  appellant's spontaneous  inquiry was  not\n\ninterrogative, we must determine whether it  nevertheless consti-\n\n                    \n\n     3The  government does not deny that appellant was in \"custo-\ndy\" during her conversation with Hutchings.\n\n     4Unlike the present case, the issue in Innis was whether the\n                                                 \npolice  had initiated \"interrogation\" after the defendant invoked\nMiranda.   Although the basic test  for custodial \"interrogation\"\n       \ndoes  not differ  in the  pre-Miranda context,  courts should  be\n                                     \nparticularly  alert to  the presence  of subtle  declarations and\nconduct by the police, such as those challenged in Innis, because\n                                                        \nan unwarned defendant may be  less alert to her rights or  to the\nrisks of \"volunteered or spontaneous\" admissions.\n\n                                7\n\ntuted the \"functional equivalent.\"  Id. at 302.5\n                                       \n\n          Appellant argues  that Hutchings intended to  elicit an\n\nincriminating statement en  route to  the county jail.   As  evi-\n\ndence, she points to Hutchings' own testimony that suspects often\n\nengage in conversation or  general banter while being transported\n\nto  jail.   More  pointedly, she  asserts  that, when  Hutchings'\n\nexpectation was confirmed by appellant's inquiry, he deliberately\n\nnarrowed  his  response by  referring  directly  to the  criminal\n\ncharge for which appellant had just been arrested.\n\n          The \"functional equivalence\" test  does not turn on the\n\n                    \n\n     5The government insists that  the district court ruling that\nthe Hutchings  response did not  constitute custodial \"interroga-\ntion\"  is subject to \"clear error\" review only.  Normally, \"clear\nerror\" is the  standard employed in  reviewing findings of  fact.\nSee  United States  v. Falon,  959 F.2d  1143, 1146-47  (1st Cir.\n                            \n1992);  United States  v. Sanchez,  943 F.2d  110, 112  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n1991).  In the present case, however, none of the  relevant facts\nare in dispute.  Hutchings alone testified at the motion hearing,\nconceding that appellant was not  given Miranda warnings and that\n                                               \nthe in-transit conversation occurred.  Thus, the determination as\nto whether police \"interrogation\" occurred depends on the totali-\nty of the circumstances, a balancing analysis commonly considered\namenable to plenary review.  See, e.g., United States v. Calisto,\n                                                                \n838 F.2d  711, 717-18 (3d Cir. 1988); United States v. Poole, 794\n                                                            \nF.2d 462,  465  (9th Cir.  1986)  (holding that,  absent  factual\ndispute, totality  test \"requires us to  'consider legal concepts\nin the  mix of fact  and law and  to exercise judgment  about the\nvalues'  underlying the  Miranda rule  and the  fifth amendment\")\n                                \n(citation omitted).  Indeed,  the need for a  heightened standard\nof  review seems implicit in some  of the seminal \"interrogation\"\ncases.   See, e.g., Arizona  v. Mauro,  481 U.S. 520,  528-29 n.6\n                                     \n(1987)  (reversing \"interrogation\" determination by state supreme\ncourt, and challenging dissent's assertion that court  improperly\ndisregarded factual findings:   \"[The] facts of this case  do not\npresent a  sufficient likelihood of incrimination  to satisfy the\nlegal  standard articulated  in Miranda  v.

We think  Hutchings' conduct\n\nindicates no premeditated or deliberate design, but evidences, at\n\nmost,  Hutchings'  awareness that  appellant  might  continue the\n\nconversation she spontaneously initiated.   See, e.g., Innis, 446\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  at 303  (noting that  police comments  were part  of \"brief\n\n                                9\n\nconversation\" containing  \"a few offhand remarks\");  Plazinich v.\n                                                              \n\nLynaugh,  843 F.2d 836, 840  (5th Cir. 1988)  (noting brevity and\n       \n\ninformality of  officer's statement  to defendant as  evidence of\n\nlack of \"interrogation\"), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1031 (1989).6\n                                      \n\n          Nor can we agree that Hutchings' answer  unresponsively\n\n\"narrowed\"  appellant's  inquiry,  or  designedly  channeled  her\n\nattention toward  dangerous waters.   Viewed objectively,  appel-\n\nlant's initial inquiry  (\"Why is  this happening to  me?\") was  a\n\ndirect request for an explanation as to why she was under arrest.\n                                                                \n\nAppellant  would have us propound a rule that police officers may\n\nnot answer direct questions, even in the most cursory and respon-\n\nsive manner.  It might well be argued, however, that an officer's\n\nrefusal to respond  to such  a direct question  in these  circum-\n\nstances  would be at  least as likely  to be  perceived as having\n\nbeen intended to elicit  increasingly inculpatory statements from\n\na disconsolate suspect arrested  moments before.  Although  we do\n\nnot  rule out the possibility that \"interrogation\" might occur as\n\na consequence  of a police  officer's response to,  or relentless\n\npursuit  of, this  type of inquiry  in other  circumstances, cf.,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Harryman v.

She relies on expert testimony  presented in\n\nthe case of  United States v. Osburn, 756 F.  Supp. 571 (N.D.

Congress  reasonably may opt  for a punitive\n\ndeterrent against large-scale marijuana  manufacturing operations\n\nwhich  pose a  greater  threat than  small-scale operations,  and\n\nwarrant exponentially enhanced punishment.

Probable Cause for Search Warrant\n                                     \n\n          On the morning of July 17, 1991, Robert Hutchings, Jr.,\n\na  special agent of  the Maine  Bureau of  Intergovernmental Drug\n\nEnforcement  (\"BIDE\"), spoke  with a  confidential  informant who\n\nreported that he  recently had visited  appellant Taylor and  her\n\nhusband  at property  in Levant,  Maine,  upon which  the Taylors\n\nresided in separate mobile homes.  The informant observed several\n\nlarge marijuana plants (up to 4 feet tall) growing in appellant's\n\nvegetable garden  and around  the perimeter  of her  mobile home,\n\nseveral hundred marijuana seedlings (5 to 6 inches  tall) growing\n\nin milk cartons and crates and awaiting transplantation to nearby\n\nwoods,  and an \"unusual amount\"  of zip lock  storage bags inside\n\nappellant's  residence.   During  one visit,  appellant told  the\n\ninformant she was  concerned because she  had started more  seed-\n\nlings than she could tend.\n\n          The same  day he received  the tip from  the informant,\n\nAgent Hutchings consulted the affidavit submitted in support of a\n\n1986 search warrant application, in which another officer attest-\n\ned that he had  purchased marijuana from Taylor on  two occasions\n\nand personally observed marijuana plants growing on her property.\n\nA local drug task force report noted that Taylor had pled  guilty\n\nto two counts of marijuana trafficking in October 1986.  Incorpo-\n\nrating  this evidence  into  an affidavit,  Hutchings obtained  a\n\nstate court  search warrant  which was  executed later that  day.\n\nAppellant ultimately  was charged  in the United  States District\n\nCourt for the District  of Maine with manufacturing marijuana  in\n\nviolation of federal law.\n\n          The district  court denied  appellant's motion  to sup-\n\npress the physical evidence  (marijuana plants and drug parapher-\n\nnalia) based on an  alleged absence of probable cause  to support\n\nthe  search warrant.   Appellant  contends that  Agent Hutchings'\n\nsworn statements  vouching for the  informant's reliability  were\n\nconclusory  and  that the  tips  provided by  the  informant were\n\ninadequately corroborated.\n\n          The  sufficiency  of  a  search  warrant  affidavit  is\n\nappraised against well-established criteria:\n\n          The task of the issuing  magistrate is simply\n          to  make  a practical,  common-sense decision\n          whether,  given  all  the  circumstances  set\n          forth in the affidavit before  him, including\n          the  \"veracity\" and  \"basis of  knowledge\" of\n          persons supplying  hearsay information, there\n          is  a  fair  probability  that  contraband or\n          evidence of a crime  will be found in  a par-\n          ticular place.   And the duty  of a reviewing\n          court is simply to ensure that the magistrate\n          had a \"substantial  basis for . . .  conclud-\n          [ing]\" that probable cause existed.\n\nUnited  States  v.
