This sentencing appeal  is long\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\non rhetoric, but short on  merit.  Having considered and rejected\n\ndefendant's  three assignments of  error, we affirm  the judgment\n\nbelow.\n\n                                I\n\n          First,  defendant-appellant  Alberto  Gonzales contends\n\nthat  the district court  erred in imposing  a two-level sentence\n\nenhancement for  obstruction of  justice.1   See U.S.S.G.   3C1.1\n                                                \n\n(Nov. 1992).  The  contention is jejune.  We  review a sentencing\n\ncourt's   factfinding  in   these  precincts   with  considerable\n\ndeference.  See,  e.g., United States v. Veilleux,  949 F.2d 522,\n                                                 \n\n525-26 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that an obstruction of justice\n\nfinding will be upheld if  not clearly erroneous); United  States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Wheelwright,  918 F.2d  226, 228  (1st  Cir. 1990)  (similar).\n              \n\nHere, the district court  had before it convincing  evidence that\n\nappellant  attempted to coax  an acquaintance into  bearing false\n\nwitness about  a matter  material to the  case.   Such scurrilous\n\ndeportment  clearly  can   constitute  obstruction  of   justice,\n\nwarranting  a two-level enhancement of a defendant's base offense\n\nlevel.  See U.S.S.G.  3C1.1, comment. (n. 3(b)) (Nov. 1992).\n           \n\n          Attempting to avoid this result, appellant asserts that\n\nthe district court failed to make a finding of specific intent in\n\n                    \n\n     1In  general, a sentencing  court applies the  guidelines in\neffect on the date of sentencing.  See United States v. Bell, 953\n                                                            \nF.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Harotunian,  920 F.2d\n                                                      \n1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990).  Gonzales was sentenced on July 2,\n1993.   Hence,  this  case  is controlled  by  the November  1992\nedition of the guidelines.\n\n                                2\n\nrespect to obstructing justice.   We read the record differently.\n\nThe  judge  found  explicitly, and  supportably,  that  appellant\n\n\"intentionally  and  knowingly  attempted   to  persuade  another\n\nindividual to  testify falsely in  court as to a  material matter\n\n(e.g., that  law  enforcement agents  illegally  used  contraband\n     \n\nsubstances  during a  drug buy  in the  course of  their official\n\nduties in this case).\"   In our view, no more is exigible.  We do\n\nnot  demand that  judges,  when explaining  the  bases for  their\n\nrulings, \"be precise to the point of pedantry.\"  Lenn v. Portland\n                                                                 \n\nSch.  Comm., 998  F.2d  1083, 1088  (1st  Cir. 1993)  (collecting\n           \n\ncases).  Giving due weight to context and common sense, we accept\n\nthe  sentencing  judge's  use of  the  phrase  \"intentionally and\n\nknowingly\"  in  this  case  as the  functional  equivalent  of an\n\nexpress finding of specific intent.2\n\n                                II\n\n          Next, appellant posits that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to lower  his sentence for acceptance  of responsibility.\n\nSee U.S.S.G.  3E1.1 (Nov. 1992).  We do not agree.\n   \n\n          A  defendant bears the burden of proving entitlement to\n\ndecreases in  the offense level,  including downward  adjustments\n\nfor acceptance of  responsibility.  See United States v. Morillo,\n                                                                \n\n    F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1993) [No. 93-1388, slip op.  at 16];\n\nUnited  States v.  Bradley, 917  F.2d 601,  606 (1st  Cir. 1990).\n                          \n\n                    \n\n     2Appellant   also  suggests  that  the  act  of  subornation\noccurred because he  was suffering from opioid withdrawal.   That\nsuggestion  has no  credible support  in the  record.   We cannot\nfault the district court for  failing to accept sheer speculation\nin place of hard proof.\n\n                                3\n\nOnce the sentencing  court has ruled against a  defendant on such\n\nan issue, he  \"faces an uphill battle.\"  Morillo,     F.3d at    \n                                                \n\n[slip op. at 16].  In large part, the uphill nature of the battle\n\nrelates  to  the  standard  of  appellate  review:    \"Whether  a\n\ndefendant  `clearly demonstrates  a  recognition and  affirmative\n\nacceptance of personal responsibility' is a fact-dominated issue,\n\nand the district court's decision  to withhold a reduction in the\n\noffense level will  not be overturned unless  clearly erroneous.\"\n\nUnited States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1990) (citation\n                      \n\nomitted).\n\n          Here, the uphill battle is  fought on a slope too steep\n\nfor  appellant  to climb.    There  is  a  logical  inconsistency\n\nbetween, on one hand, attempting to obstruct justice, and, on the\n\nother hand,  accepting responsibility in  a timeous manner.   The\n\nguidelines acknowledge this  inconsistency.  Only  \"extraordinary\n\ncases\"   qualify  for   an  acceptance-of-responsibility   credit\n\nfollowing  an  enhancement  for  obstruction  of  justice.    See\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.    3E1.1, comment. (n.  4) (Nov. 1992); see  also United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Olea, 987 F.2d 874, 878 (1st  Cir. 1993).  A defendant\n               \n\nmust carry the burden of proving that his case is \"extraordinary\"\n\nand,  thus, that  it  comes  within the  narrow  confines of  the\n\nexception.  See Olea, 987 F.2d at 878.\n                    \n\n          Appellant  cannot scale  these heights.   The  district\n\njudge  discerned  \"nothing   in  this   case  to   make  it   the\n\nextraordinary  case  required by  the guideline  application note\n\nthat would justify  a reduction for acceptance  of responsibility\n\n                                4\n\nin the base offense level, in the face of the court's  finding of\n\nobstruction  of justice.\"  That conclusion  is fully supported by\n\nthe record.  Indeed, the only thing extraordinary about this case\n\nis appellant's temerity in continuing to press for a credit under\n\nsection 3E1.1 notwithstanding his failed effort at subornation. \n\n          Undaunted, appellant tries another tack.  Invoking  the\n\ndoctrine of United States v. Perez-Franco, 873 F.2d 455, 463 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir.  1989),  appellant  says that  the  lower  court erroneously\n\ndenied a section  3E1.1 adjustment based  on its perception  that\n\nappellant failed to accept responsibility for uncharged \"relevant\n                                                       \n\nconduct\".  We think that appellant's reliance on  Perez-Franco is\n                                                              \n\nmislaid.   There is a  meaningful distinction between a defendant\n\nwho  does  not  accept  responsibility  for  conduct   underlying\n\ndismissed charges (the Perez-Franco scenario) and a defendant who\n                                   \n\nfalsely denies, or  frivolously contests, the occurrence  of such\n\nbehavior.   See Olea, 987 F.2d at 878.   While a defendant is not\n                    \n\nrequired  affirmatively to admit  conduct beyond the  offenses of\n\nconviction   in  order  to   obtain  credit  for   acceptance  of\n\nresponsibility, see  Perez-Franco, 873 F.2d  at 463, a  court may\n                                 \n\nproperly  consider whether  a  defendant who  mendaciously denies\n\nrelevant   conduct  has  acted  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with\n\naccepting  responsibility, see Olea,  987 F.2d  at 878;  see also\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.  3E1.1,  comment.  (n.1(a))  (Nov. 1992).   The district\n\ncourt  found, in  effect, that  this case  belongs to  the latter\n\ngenre.  The court's finding is supportable.  Thus, the assignment\n\nof error fizzles.\n\n                                5\n\n                               III\n\n          Among  other   things,   appellant   pled   guilty   to\n\npurchasing, receiving,  and possessing  six handguns  after being\n\nconvicted of  a felony.  See 18 U.S.C.    922 (g)(1), 924 (a)(2).\n                            \n\nA  defendant charged  under  these  statutes  is  entitled  to  a\n\nreduction  in his  base offense  level  if he  can prove  that he\n\npossessed the  challenged firearms  \"solely  for lawful  sporting\n\npurposes or collection.\"  U.S.S.G.  2K2.1(b)(2) (Nov. 1992).  The\n\ndistrict court refused  to grant this  reduction.  Appellant  now\n\ncomplains.\n\n          A   defendant  bears  the   burden  of  proving   by  a\n\npreponderance of the  evidence that he is entitled  to a downward\n\nadjustment  under section   2K2.1(b)(2).   See  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nCousens,  942  F.2d 800,  802  (1st Cir.  1992).   We  review the\n       \n\nsentencing  court's  findings of  fact  on this  issue  for clear\n\nerror.  See id.   We have carefully sifted the  record, including\n               \n\nappellant's changing  accounts of  why the  handguns were  in his\n\npossession.  Given the implausibility of appellant's tale and the\n\ndearth of corroborative  evidence, we find no clear  error in the\n\ndistrict  court's finding that appellant was  acting neither as a\n\nsportsman nor  as a  collector in assembling  a small  arsenal of\n\nhandguns.   Hence,  we uphold  the court's  refusal to  grant the\n\nrequested reduction.\n\n                                IV\n\n                                6\n\n          We need go  no further.3  Shortly  after the sentencing\n\nguidelines took effect, we wrote that:\n\n          Sentencing    appeals    prosecuted   without\n          discernible rhyme  or reason, in  the tenuous\n          hope that lightning may strike,  ought not to\n          be   dignified   with    exegetic   opinions,\n          intricate  factual  synthesis,  or full-dress\n          explications  of  accepted  legal principles.\n          Assuredly, a criminal  defendant deserves his\n          day in court;but we see no purpose in wasting\n          overtaxed judicial  resources razing  castles\n          in the air.\n\nUnited States v.

Invoking the doctrine of United States v.

We think that appellant's reliance on Perez-Franco is mislaid.  There is a meaningful distinction between a defendant who does not accept responsibility for conduct underlying dismissed charges (the Perez-Franco scenario) and a defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, the occurrence of such behavior.  See Olea, 987 F.2d at 878.   While a defendant is not required affirmatively to admit conduct beyond the offenses of conviction in order to obtain credit for acceptance of responsibility, see Perez-Franco, 873 F.2d at 463, a court may properly consider whether a defendant who mendaciously denies relevant conduct has acted in a manner inconsistent with accepting responsibility, see Olea, 987 F.2d at 878;  see also U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1, comment.  (n. 1(a)) (Nov.1992).  The district court found, in effect, that this case belongs to the latter genre.  The court's finding is supportable.

We have carefully sifted the record, including appellant's changing accounts of why the handguns were in his possession.  Given the implausibility of appellant's tale and the dearth of corroborative evidence, we find no clear error in the district court's finding that appellant was acting neither as a sportsman nor as a collector in assembling a small arsenal of handguns.

Having considered and rejected defendant's three assignments of error, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* First, defendant-appellant Alberto Gonzales contends that the district court erred in imposing a two-level sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 (Nov.1992).  The contention is jejune.  We review a sentencing court's factfinding in these precincts with considerable deference.  See, e.g., United States v. Veilleux, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572410\"><a href=\"/opinion/572410/united-states-v-timothy-lee-veilleux/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 525-26 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that an obstruction of justice finding will be upheld if not clearly erroneous);  United States v. Wheelwright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551269\"><a href=\"/opinion/551269/united-states-v-john-wheelwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 228 (1st Cir.1990) (similar).  Here, the district court had before it convincing evidence that appellant attempted to coax an acquaintance into bearing false witness about a matter material to the case.  Such scurrilous deportment clearly can constitute obstruction of justice, warranting a two-level enhancement of a defendant's base offense level.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 3(b)) (Nov.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to avoid this result, appellant asserts that the district court failed to make a finding of specific intent in respect to obstructing justice.  We read the record differently.  The judge found explicitly, and supportably, that appellant \"intentionally and knowingly attempted to persuade another individual to testify falsely in court as to a material matter (e.g., that law enforcement agents illegally used contraband substances during a drug buy in the course of their official duties in this case).\"   In our view, no more is exigible.  We do not demand that judges, when explaining the bases for their rulings, \"be precise to the point of pedantry.\"  Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611562\"><a href=\"/opinion/611562/daniel-lenn-etc-v-portland-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span>, 1088 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting cases).  Giving due weight to context and common sense, we accept the sentencing judge's use of the phrase \"intentionally and knowingly\" in this case as the functional equivalent of an express finding of specific intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, appellant posits that the district court erred in failing to lower his sentence for acceptance of responsibility.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 (Nov.1992).  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant bears the burden of proving entitlement to decreases in the offense level, including downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility.  See United States v. Morillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 865 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Bradley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir.1990).  Once the sentencing court has ruled against a defendant on such an issue, he \"faces an uphill battle.\"  Morillo, 8 F.3d at 865.   In large part, the uphill nature of the battle relates to the standard of appellate review:  \"Whether a defendant 'clearly demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility' is a fact-dominated issue, and the district court's decision to withhold a reduction in the offense level will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\"  United States v. Royer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536029\"><a href=\"/opinion/536029/united-states-v-marc-a-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the uphill battle is fought on a slope too steep for appellant to climb.  There is a logical inconsistency between, on one hand, attempting to obstruct justice, and, on the other hand, accepting responsibility in a timeous manner.  The guidelines acknowledge this inconsistency.  Only \"extraordinary cases\" qualify for an acceptance-of-responsibility credit following an enhancement for obstruction of justice.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1, comment.  (n. 4) (Nov.1992);  see also United  States v. Olea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601783\"><a href=\"/opinion/601783/united-states-v-santos-olea/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></a></span>, 878 (1st Cir.1993).  A defendant must carry the burden of proving that his case is \"extraordinary\" and, thus, that it comes within the narrow confines of the exception.  See Olea, 987 F.2d at 878.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant cannot scale these heights.  The district judge discerned \"nothing in this case to make it the extraordinary case required by the guideline application note that would justify a reduction for acceptance of responsibility in the base offense level, in the face of the court's finding of obstruction of justice.\"   That conclusion is fully supported by the record.  Indeed, the only thing extraordinary about this case is appellant's temerity in continuing to press for a credit under section 3E1.1 notwithstanding his failed effort at subornation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undaunted, appellant tries another tack.
