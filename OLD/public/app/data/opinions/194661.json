Appellants Jose  de Jesus\n                                \n\nRios (\"Jose  Rios\")  and his  cousin,  Eva Maria  Rios  (\"Eva\n\nRios\"), were convicted  of aiding and abetting  each other in\n\nthe importation  of approximately  196  kilograms of  cocaine\n\ninto the customs territory of  the United States in violation\n\nof 18  U.S.C.   2  and 21 U.S.C.    952(a).   Appellants also\n\nwere  convicted  of aiding  and  abetting each  other  in the\n\npossession with intent to  distribute cocaine in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C.    2 and  21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1).  On  appeal, both\n\nmaintain that the evidence  was insufficient to support their\n\nrespective  convictions.    Eva  Rios also  argues  that  the\n\ndistrict court  erred in denying  her motion to  suppress the\n\npretrial identifications of her  by two government witnesses.\n\nAfter  careful consideration  of  the record,  we affirm  the\n\nconviction of Jose Rios and vacate that of Eva Rios.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      Factual Background\n                                        \n\n           The  two  principal  government witnesses,  George\n\nRivera  Antron  (\"Rivera\")  and  Juan  Enrique  Mejias  Valle\n\n(\"Mejias\"),  brothers-in-law who  had known  each other  more\n\nthan thirty years, worked together  aboard a vessel named the\n\n\"Santa  Martina.\"   The  Santa  Martina, which  was  owned by\n\nRivera, transported  general  cargo between  the  islands  of\n\nPuerto  Rico and St. Thomas.   Rivera made  his livelihood as\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nthe  captain of the Santa Martina, and Mejias was employed as\n\nhis assistant. \n\n          On February  7, 1991, at  approximately 5:30  p.m.,\n\nwhile Mejias  was working  on  the Santa  Martina, which  was\n\ndocked  at a  port in  St. Thomas,  two women  approached him\n\nlooking  for Rivera.  Mejias informed them that Rivera was on\n\nan errand and would probably return around 6:00 p.m.  The two\n\nwomen waited for  Rivera for  approximately fifteen  minutes,\n\nduring which time they engaged Mejias in casual conversation.\n\nFor reasons  unexplained in the record,  they departed before\n\nRivera returned to the boat.\n\n          The following morning,  at approximately 8:00 a.m.,\n\none of the two women returned to the boat looking for Rivera.\n\nMejias, who  was preparing  the boat for  departure, informed\n\nher that Rivera was on an errand and would return shortly.  A\n\nfew minutes later Rivera returned, and the woman, posing as a\n\ncommercial dealer  in detergent,  asked him to  transport ten\n\nboxes of  detergent to Fajardo,  Puerto Rico.   Rivera agreed\n\nand they made the necessary arrangements.   When Rivera asked\n\nwhat name should be  entered on the receipt as  \"sender,\" the\n\nwoman  responded \"A &amp; A  Supplies.\"  When  asked what name to\n\nenter  as receiver, she responded \"Papo Rios.\"  At some point\n\nduring  their conversation,  the woman  told Rivera  that she\n\nwould  \"send  the boxes  later.\"    The conversation  between\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nRivera and the woman,  which was witnessed by  Mejias, lasted\n\nsomewhere between five and fifteen minutes.  \n\n          Approximately one-half hour after she left, two men\n\ndrove  up to the dock in a truck  with the ten boxes.  One of\n\nthe men told Rivera that \"the lady sent the boxes.\"  About an\n\nhour  after the ten boxes were loaded onto the Santa Martina,\n\nRivera  and Mejias  departed St.  Thomas for  Fajardo, Puerto\n\nRico.\n\n          The Santa  Martina  arrived in  Fajardo later  that\n\nafternoon.  After docking the vessel,  Rivera went to customs\n\nto enter all of his cargo.  On the way to customs, Rivera was\n\napproached by Jose Rios, who --  as it turned out -- had been\n\na longtime  acquaintance of Rivera's.  Rivera  knew Jose Rios\n\nas \"Papo Rios.\"   Rivera asked Jose Rios to  accompany him to\n\ncustoms to sign for the ten boxes being delivered to him.  On\n\nthe way  to customs,  Jose Rios  disclaimed ownership of  the\n\nboxes, and told Rivera that he did not know why the boxes had\n\nbeen sent to him.  At customs, however, Jose Rios signed  the\n\nentry  declaration as the \"owner\"  of the ten  boxes.  Rafael\n\nFigueroa, a  United States  customs agent who  witnessed Jose\n\nRios sign the declaration,  testified that Jose Rios appeared\n\n\"nervous\" as he answered questions about his ownership of the\n\nten boxes. \n\n           After all  of the relevant  customs documents were\n\nprocessed, Rivera, Jose Rios, and United States Customs Agent\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nAngel  Luis Villegas  Lopez (\"Agent  Villegas\"), went  to the\n\nSanta Martina to unload its cargo.  As Jose Rios was carrying\n\none  of  the  boxes  off  the  boat,  Agent  Villegas  became\n\nsuspicious about its weight and decided to inspect it.  Agent\n\nVillegas opened one  of the boxes and  discovered powder that\n\nappeared to be cocaine.   Upon hearing that cocaine  may have\n\nbeen discovered, Jose Rios disclaimed ownership of the boxes,\n\nstated  that he  was  \"going to  look  for the  owners,\"  and\n\npromptly departed the scene.\n\n          Shortly  thereafter,  Agent  Villegas  conducted  a\n\nfield test  on the powder  in one  of the boxes.   That  test\n\nyielded a positive result for  cocaine.1  The government then\n\nseized the  Santa Martina, informing Rivera that  it would be\n\nheld  pending the  investigation.   Several  days later,  the\n\ngovernment  arrested Jose Rios, and began  its search for the\n\nas  yet unidentified woman who  had contracted with Rivera to\n\nship the ten boxes to  Fajardo.  The facts leading up  to the\n\nidentification ofEva Rios asthat person aresummarized below.2\n\n                    \n\n1.  A subsequent  field test  and laboratory analysis  of the\npowder in  the ten  boxes confirmed that  it was cocaine.   A\ngovernment witness  testified that the cocaine  had a \"street\nvalue\" of as much as 40 million dollars.\n\n2.  In reviewing  the  denial of  a motion  to suppress,  our\nreview is not  limited to the  transcript of the  suppression\nhearing where, as here,  the defendant renewed her motion  at\ntrial.   See United States v.  Thomas, 875 F.2d 559,  562 n.2\n                                     \n(6th Cir.) (holding that appellate review of denial of motion\nto suppress  may include evidence  adduced at  trial only  in\ncases  where defendant  renews  the motion  at trial),  cert.\n                                                             \ndenied, 493  U.S. 867  (1989).  See  also 4 Wayne  R. LaFave,\n                                         \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          On February  8, 1991,  both Rivera and  Mejias gave\n\nverbal  descriptions of  the  woman who  had contracted  with\n\nRivera to  United States Customs Agent  Hector Marti Figueroa\n\n(\"Agent Marti\").   According to Agent Marti,  both Rivera and\n\nMejias described  the woman  as a  \"Latin female\"  with \"dark\n\nhair\"  and  \"white\"  skin  who  was  \"a  little  chubby\"  and\n\napproximately five feet, two inches tall.\n\n          On February 11, 1991, Rivera  was interviewed again\n\nby United  States Customs  Agent Juan Dania  (\"Agent Dania\"),\n\nand Agent Marti.   Relying  upon written  notes, Agent  Dania\n\ntestified that Rivera described her as \"white\" with \"shoulder\n\nlength  [black] hair\"  and  \"a full  face  .  . .  with  fine\n\nfeatures.\"3  The next  day, on February 12, Agents  Dania and\n\n                    \n\nSearch  &amp;  Seizure    11.7(c),  at  519  (2d  ed. 1987)  (\"If\n                  \nfollowing [her] conviction the  defendant takes an appeal and\nclaims that [her] motion  to suppress was erroneously denied,\n.  . .  the appellate  court  [must] consider  trial evidence\n                                                    \nfavorable to .  . . the  defendant . .  . where the  pretrial\nmotion is renewed and reconsidered  by the trial judge during\nthe  course of trial.\")  (emphasis in original).   Cf. United\n                                                             \nStates v. Vargas, 633 F.2d 891, 895 n.6 (1st Cir. 1980) (\"the\n                \nuse of trial testimony to undermine the validity of an arrest\n                                   \nor search is apparently discouraged, at least when the motion\nto suppress has not been renewed  and reconsidered during the\ncourse of the trial\") (emphasis in original).  \n\n3.  At  the  suppression  hearing, Rivera  admitted  that  he\ndescribed the suspect to  Agent Dania as \"white.\"   At trial,\nhowever, Rivera  testified that  he used the  phrase \"blanca-\nattrigenado,\"  which -- according to the English translations\noffered by  both the government  and defense attorneys  -- is\napparently  equivalent  to  describing someone  as  a \"light-\nskinned black person.\"  Although a  description of Eva Rios's\nactual  skin color does not appear anywhere in the record, it\nis  apparent  from  the  government's  and  defense counsel's\nbriefs  that  the   phrase  \"blanca-attrigenado\"   accurately\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nMarti  also interviewed  Mejias.   Relying  upon his  written\n\nnotes, Agent Dania testified  that Mejias described the woman\n\nas \"white.\"\n\n          Although the  record is not clear,  it appears that\n\nEva Rios became a  suspect based upon independent information\n\nfrom a confidential informant.   Apparently relying upon that\n\ninformation,  Agents Marti  and  Dania decided  to conduct  a\n\nshow-up   identification  procedure   using  Rivera   as  the\n\nidentifying witness  and Eva  Rios as the  potential suspect.\n\nTo that end,  on February  16, 1991, they  arranged with  Eva\n\nRios  to  meet them  in front  of  the United  States Customs\n\nBuilding  in  St.  Thomas.    Immediately  after  making  the\n\narrangements  with Eva  Rios, Agent  Marti phoned  Rivera and\n\ninstructed him to be at the United States Customs Building by\n\n11:30 a.m.  \n\n          Upon  Rivera's arrival,   Agent Marti  informed him\n\nthat a suspect, named \"Eva Rios,\" would be meeting the agents\n\non the steps of  the customs building sometime between  11:30\n\na.m.  and 12:00  p.m.   Marti also  informed Rivera  that the\n\npurpose of  Eva  Rios's visit  was to  allow him  to make  an\n\nidentification of her.   Rivera  was instructed to  sit in  a\n\nparked car  across the street from the  customs building, and\n\nto signal the agents with a white handkerchief as  soon as he\n\n                    \n\ndescribes her skin color.   \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\ncould positively identify her as the woman with whom he spoke\n\non the morning of February 8, 1991.\n\n          At some  point between  11:30 a.m. and  12:00 p.m.,\n\nEva Rios  arrived at the customs building.   Rivera testified\n\nthat  he saw her as she drove by,  as she parked her car, and\n\nagain as she walked by his  parked car.  He did not, however,\n\ngive a signal  to the officers until she  walked up to Agents\n\nMarti and Dania, shook their hands, and sat down next to them\n\non the stairs of  the customs building.  Based  upon Rivera's\n\npositive identification  of Eva Rios, Agents  Marti and Dania\n\narrested her on the spot.\n\n          The record  reveals that  February 16, 1991,  was a\n\nSaturday, Eva Rios's car was  the only car that drove  by the\n\ncustoms building  during the  time Rivera  was in  his parked\n\ncar,  and,  while  several  women  \"passed  by\"  the  customs\n\nbuilding during that time, only Eva Rios stopped to talk with\n\nthe  agents.  Agents Marti and Dania also testified that they\n\nwould not  have arrested Eva  Rios but for  Rivera's positive\n\nidentification of  her.   Subsequently, on or  about February\n\n22,  1991,  the  government  returned the  Santa  Martina  to\n\nRivera.\n\n          On  February  25,  1991,  Rivera  and  Mejias  were\n\nbrought  to an  office in  the customs  building and  shown a\n\nphoto-spread  of six photographs, one of  which was Eva Rios.\n\nBoth Rivera  and Mejias  positively identified Eva  Rios from\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nthe  photo  spread.    After  Rivera and  Mejias  made  their\n\nrespective identifications, Agent Marti, the agent  in charge\n\nof  the procedure,  asked  both of  them  to sign  affidavits\n\nattesting  to the  results.    They  also included  in  their\n\naffidavits an  additional description of the  woman with whom\n\nthey spoke on February  8.  Rivera described her as  \"a young\n\nwoman  . . . with  dark hair, light  brown complexion, thirty\n\nyears old . . . and somewhat fat.\"  Mejias described her as a\n\nlady  \"with light brown  skin, of average  height .  . . dark\n\nhair and a little fat.\"  \n\n          Agent Marti testified  that Rivera and  Mejias made\n\ntheir   identifications  at   different   times  and   \"never\n\nencountered each  other at the office.\"4   When asked whether\n\nhe had  had any discussions  with Rivera about  the incident,\n\nMejias testified that  he ended  his employment  relationship\n\nwith  Rivera on  February 8,  1991, and  had not  seen Rivera\n\nbetween  that date  and February  25, 1991,  the date  of the\n\nphoto spread identification.   During their  trial testimony,\n\nRivera and  Mejias also made in-court  identifications of Eva\n\nRios as the woman with whom they spoke on February 8, 1991.\n\n                    \n\n4.  Agent  Marti's testimony  on this question  was, however,\ncontradicted by Mejias, who testified  during the suppression\nhearing  that,  on February  25, he  and  Rivera were  at the\noffice  at the same  time but  went into  the office  to make\ntheir  identifications separately.    Mejias testified  that,\nwhile he  waited in the hall to be called into the office, he\nsaw Rivera walk into and out of the office.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          At trial,  both defendants took the  stand in their\n\nown defense.  Jose Rios  testified that he had been  asked by\n\nhis cousin,  Evaristo Rios (Eva  Rios's brother), to  pick up\n\nthe  boxes on  board  the  Santa  Martina.    He  denied  any\n\nknowledge that  the boxes contained cocaine,  and claimed not\n\nto have spoken with Eva Rios  for seven or eight years.  When\n\nasked  why he signed the  customs document as  the \"owner\" of\n\nthe ten boxes, he stated  that he did so in order to  pick up\n\nthe boxes for his cousin.\n\n          As well as arguing  that she had been misidentified\n\nby  Rivera and Mejias,  Eva Rios presented  an alibi defense.\n\nEssentially, her alibi witnesses testified that she could not\n\nhave  been  on  the St.  Thomas  waterfront  at  the time  in\n\nquestion.  One witness,  who worked at the school  Eva Rios's\n\ndaughter  attends,  remembered  Eva  Rios  dropping  off  her\n\ndaughter  at the school at  around 7:30 a.m.,  on February 8,\n\n1991.    An  employee  at  Eva  Rios's  place  of  employment\n\ntestified that Eva Rios was at work on February 8, 1991,  and\n\nusually arrived at  work between  8:00-8:10 a.m.   A  traffic\n\nofficer  in St. Thomas  further testified that,  based on the\n\ncommon traffic conditions  in St. Thomas, Eva  Rios would not\n\nhave  been able to travel  from her daughter's  school to the\n\nwaterfront  and then to her office between 7:30 a.m. and 8:10\n\na.m. \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          On April 30, 1991, the jury found Jose and Eva Rios\n\nguilty  on both  counts.   Jose  Rios  was sentenced  to  210\n\nmonths, and Eva Rios  to 188 months, of imprisonment.   These\n\nappeals followed.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\nA.  The  Admissibility of the Pretrial Identifications of Eva\n                                                             \n\nRios\n    \n\n          Eva  Rios's principal contention  on appeal is that\n\nRivera's February  16, 1991, pretrial  identification of  her\n\nwas  the  result of  a  highly  suggestive, prejudicial,  and\n\nunlawful showup procedure, the introduction of which violated\n\nher  due process  rights.    She  also argues  that  Rivera's\n\nFebruary  25, 1991,  and  his  in-court identifications  were\n\ntainted   by  the   previous   identification,  and   should,\n\ntherefore, also have been kept from the jury.5    \n\n          We  will  uphold a  district  court's  denial of  a\n\nmotion  to suppress  if any  reasonable view of  the evidence\n\nsupports it.   See, e.g.,  United States  v. McLaughlin,  957\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir.  1992).  Moreover, the findings of  the\n\n                    \n\n5.  Additionally, Eva Rios argues that the February 25, 1991,\nphoto   spread   identification  procedure   was  irregularly\nadministered  and,  therefore, rendered  Mejias's independent\nidentification of her inadmissible as  well.  For the reasons\namply addressed  in the district court's  opinion, see United\n                                                             \nStates  v.

See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g.,  Allen  v. Massachusetts,  926  F.2d 74,  81  (1st Cir.\n                              \n\n1991);  United States v.

First,  the\n       \n\ncourt  must determine whether the procedure was impermissibly\n\nsuggestive.   See, e.g., Maguire,  918 F.2d at  263.   If the\n                                \n\ncourt finds  the procedure impermissibly suggestive,  it must\n\nthen inquire  whether, under  the totality  of circumstances,\n\nthe   identification  itself   was   reliable,  despite   the\n\nsuggestive procedure.  See, e.g., Allen, 926 F.2d at 81.  The\n                                       \n\nfactors to consider under the reliability prong are fivefold:\n\n          (1)  the  opportunity of  the  witness to\n          view the  criminal  at the  time  of  the\n          crime;   (2)   the  witness'   degree  of\n          attention;  (3)  the   accuracy  of   the\n          witness'   prior   description   of   the\n          criminal;  (4)  the  level  of  certainty\n          demonstrated  by  the   witness  at   the\n          confrontation; and (5) the length of time\n          between the crime and the confrontation.\n\nId.

Applying the  second prong  of the\n\ntest,  however,  the district  court  concluded  -- from  the\n\ntotality of the circumstances -- that Rivera's identification\n\nwas nevertheless reliable.  See De Jesus Rios, slip  op. at 4\n                                             \n\n(finding \"no significant  difference between the descriptions\n\n[Rivera]  gave before and after the [showup]\").  As a result,\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nthe court denied Eva Rios's motion to suppress that evidence.\n\nSee id. at 2-4.          After a close review of  the record,\n       \n\nwe agree with the district court's conclusion that the showup\n\nprocedure  was impermissibly suggestive but disagree with its\n\ndetermination  that  Rivera's  identification  was  otherwise\n\nreliable.  While application of the first, second,  and fifth\n\nfactors  enumerated above  does not  give us  pause,6  we are\n\ntroubled  by  application of  the  third  and fourth  factors\n\n(i.e., the accuracy of the witness's prior description of the\n     \n\ncriminal,   and  the   level   of  certainty   that   witness\n\ndemonstrated at the confrontation) to the facts of this case.\n\nAgent  Marti testified  that,  on the  date  the cocaine  was\n\ndiscovered, February 8, 1991, Rivera described the suspect as\n\n\"white\"  and  approximately  five   feet,  two  inches  tall.\n\nRivera's  testimony  at  the  suppression hearing  and  Agent\n\nDania's trial testimony revealed that during his February 11,\n\n1991, interview with Agent  Dania, Rivera again described her\n\nas \"white.\"  It  was not until  after the February 16,  1991,\n\nshowup  that Rivera  described the  suspect as  having \"light\n\n                    \n\n6.  It  is clear from the  record that Rivera  had ample time\n(at least five  minutes) to view the suspect on  the date the\narrangements were made to  ship the purported detergent, that\nhe paid  some degree of attention to  the person at the time,\nand  that eight days between the date of the cocaine shipment\nand the showup was not unreasonable.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nbrown\" skin.7   Moreover, Rivera  also failed  to provide  an\n\naccurate description of her height (five feet, six inches) at\n\neither of his pre-showup descriptions.8\n\n          The  record  also contains  uncontroverted evidence\n\nthat, despite  having been  asked at  the February  16, 1991,\n\nshowup to signal the agents when he positively identified Eva\n\nRios, Rivera waited until after she approached the agents and\n\nbegan speaking with them (as scheduled) to signal.  We hardly\n\nthink  that this  constitutes a  high degree of  certainty on\n\nRivera's part, particularly in  light of the showup procedure\n\nat issue here.   Prior  to that showup,  Rivera was  informed\n\nthat  the agents  were meeting  the suspect  in front  of the\n\ncustoms building at a specific time.  While a few other women\n\nalso may  have walked by  the customs building  that morning,\n\nonly Eva Rios stopped to speak with the agents.9  \n    \n\n                    \n\n7.  Accordingly, the  district court's finding that there was\n\"no significant  difference\" between Rivera's  pre-showup and\npost-showup descriptions of the suspect is clearly erroneous.\n\n8.  During  the suppression  hearing, Agent  Marti --  who is\napproximately five feet, seven inches tall -- testified that,\non February 8, 1991, Rivera described the suspect as being \"a\nlittle bit more  or less like my  [Agent Marti] height.\"   At\ntrial, however, he admitted that, on February 8, 1991, Rivera\ndescribed the suspect as five feet, two inches tall.\n\n9.  Our    analysis   of   the    reliability   of   Rivera's\nidentification is further informed by the undisputed evidence\nthat the  government seized Rivera's boat, his only source of\nlivelihood, on the date  of the crime, and informed  him that\nhe  would  receive  it  only after  their  investigation  was\ncompleted.    The record  also  reveals  that the  government\nreturned his  boat  less  than  a  week  after  his  positive\nidentification  of Eva Rios.  We think that these facts, when\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n          Based upon the  above analysis, therefore, we  find\n\nthat    Rivera's    pretrial   identifications    were   both\n\nimpermissibly suggestive and unreliable.  And, as this is not\n\na case of \"minimal suggestivity . . . [that could  have been]\n                  \n\ncured  at   trial,\"  Maguire,  918  F.2d   at  264  (emphasis\n                            \n\nsupplied),  we  conclude  that his  identification  testimony\n\nshould have been kept from the jury.\n\n          Our inquiry does not, however,  end here.  We  must\n\nnow   determine  whether  the   district  court's  error  was\n\n\"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Arizona v. Fulminante,\n                                                            \n\n111 S. Ct. 1246, 1265 (1991).  Outside of Rivera's testimony,\n\nthe only other evidence linking Eva Rios to the crime was the\n\ntestimony  of  Mejias,  Rivera's  brother-in-law  and  former\n\nemployee.   Mejias testified that  he spoke with  the suspect\n\nfor approximately  fifteen minutes  on February 7,  1991, the\n\nday before  the crime.   He  spoke with  her  again the  next\n\nmorning  when she  inquired  about Rivera's  whereabouts, and\n\nwitnessed the subsequent conversation between her and Rivera.\n\nHe gave descriptions of her on February 8, 12, 25, and during\n\nhis trial testimony.  Despite having described her skin color\n\nas \"white\" on both February 8 and 12, he selected her picture\n\non February 25, from a photo spread with photos of five other\n\nwomen with  similar characteristics.   Also on that  date, he\n\n                    \n\nplaced alongside  the one-person showup and  Rivera's belated\nidentification, cast serious further doubt on the reliability\n                            \nof that identification.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\ndescribed her  as having  \"light brown skin.\"   Additionally,\n\nduring his trial testimony, he identified her in court as the\n\nwoman he spoke with on February 7 and 8.\n\n          Although the harmless  error question is  close, we\n\ncannot conclude -- under the particular circumstances of this\n\ncase  -- that  the  error was  harmless  beyond a  reasonable\n\ndoubt.  First,  there is no  way for us  to discern the  role\n\nthat   Rivera's   identification   played   in   the   jury's\n\ndeliberations.   We are concerned that the jury may have been\n\npersuaded to convict  by the  very fact that  there were  two\n                                                             \n\nwitnesses  who identified Eva Rios.  It is also possible that\n\nthe  jury  relied solely  upon  the  testimony of  Rivera  in\n\nreaching  its conclusion.    Thus, we  find reasonable  doubt\n\nexists as to whether  the jury would have convicted  Eva Rios\n\nbased solely upon  Mejias's identification testimony.10   See\n                                                             \n\nClark v.

We  note that  there  exists  at  least some  basis  for\nquestioning Mejias's testimony that  his photo-spread and in-\ncourt  identifications of  Eva  Rios were  not influenced  by\nRivera's  showup  identification.    Mejias and  Rivera  were\nbrothers-in-law of more than thirty years who worked together\non Rivera's  boat.  Despite their  close relationship, Mejias\ntestified that he had no contact with Rivera between February\n8,  1991,  (the date  on which  he  and Rivera  described the\nsuspect as having \"white\" skin), and February  25, 1991, (the\ndate  on  which they  both  described the  suspect  as having\n\"light  brown\" skin  and selected  Eva Rios's picture  from a\nphoto-spread).   This testimony,  coupled with the  fact that\nMejias offered no explanation as to what caused him to change\nhis description of the suspect, may well have led the jury to\ndoubt his credibility on this critical question.   \n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nbe `no reasonable doubt' that the jury would have reached the\n\nsame  verdict without having  received the tainted evidence\")\n\n(quoting  Milton v.

Unfortunately\n\nfor appellant, these arguments fall well short of the mark.\n\n          Evidence in the  record supports an  inference that\n\nJose  Rios  did have  contact with  the  sender prior  to the\n\nshipment.  For instance, the sender instructed Rivera to fill\n\nin the name  of \"Papo Rios\" on the receipt  as the individual\n\nwho would receive the shipment.  Testimony revealed that Jose\n\nRios also  went by the name  of \"Papo Rios.\"   And, Jose Rios\n\nwas  the individual who greeted Rivera on the dock in Fajardo\n\nto pick up the ten boxes.  Further, despite having disclaimed\n\nownership  of  the ten  boxes, Jose  Rios signed  the customs\n\ndocument as the \"owner\" of the ten boxes.\n\n          Jose Rios's defense turned  upon the jury believing\n\nhis story  about having  been  duped by  his cousin  Evaristo\n\nRios.   Unfortunately for him, it appears that the jury found\n\nhis  story  unpersuasive.

Rivera made  his livelihood as\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nthe  captain of the Santa Martina, and Mejias was employed as\n\nhis assistant. \n\n          On February  7, 1991, at  approximately 5:30  p.m.,\n\nwhile Mejias  was working  on  the Santa  Martina, which  was\n\ndocked  at a  port in  St. Thomas,  two women  approached him\n\nlooking  for Rivera.  Mejias informed them that Rivera was on\n\nan errand and would probably return around 6:00 p.m.  The two\n\nwomen waited for  Rivera for  approximately fifteen  minutes,\n\nduring which time they engaged Mejias in casual conversation.\n\nFor reasons  unexplained in the record,  they departed before\n\nRivera returned to the boat.\n\n          The following morning,  at approximately 8:00 a.m.,\n\none of the two women returned to the boat looking for Rivera.\n\nMejias, who  was preparing  the boat for  departure, informed\n\nher that Rivera was on an errand and would return shortly.  A\n\nfew minutes later Rivera returned, and the woman, posing as a\n\ncommercial dealer  in detergent,  asked him to  transport ten\n\nboxes of  detergent to Fajardo,  Puerto Rico.   Rivera agreed\n\nand they made the necessary arrangements.   When Rivera asked\n\nwhat name should be  entered on the receipt as  \"sender,\" the\n\nwoman  responded \"A &amp; A  Supplies.\"  When  asked what name to\n\nenter  as receiver, she responded \"Papo Rios.\"  At some point\n\nduring  their conversation,  the woman  told Rivera  that she\n\nwould  \"send  the boxes  later.\"    The conversation  between\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nRivera and the woman,  which was witnessed by  Mejias, lasted\n\nsomewhere between five and fifteen minutes.  \n\n          Approximately one-half hour after she left, two men\n\ndrove  up to the dock in a truck  with the ten boxes.  One of\n\nthe men told Rivera that \"the lady sent the boxes.\"  About an\n\nhour  after the ten boxes were loaded onto the Santa Martina,\n\nRivera  and Mejias  departed St.  Thomas for  Fajardo, Puerto\n\nRico.\n\n          The Santa  Martina  arrived in  Fajardo later  that\n\nafternoon.  After docking the vessel,  Rivera went to customs\n\nto enter all of his cargo.  On the way to customs, Rivera was\n\napproached by Jose Rios, who --  as it turned out -- had been\n\na longtime  acquaintance of Rivera's.  Rivera  knew Jose Rios\n\nas \"Papo Rios.\"   Rivera asked Jose Rios to  accompany him to\n\ncustoms to sign for the ten boxes being delivered to him.  On\n\nthe way  to customs,  Jose Rios  disclaimed ownership of  the\n\nboxes, and told Rivera that he did not know why the boxes had\n\nbeen sent to him.  At customs, however, Jose Rios signed  the\n\nentry  declaration as the \"owner\"  of the ten  boxes.  Rafael\n\nFigueroa, a  United States  customs agent who  witnessed Jose\n\nRios sign the declaration,  testified that Jose Rios appeared\n\n\"nervous\" as he answered questions about his ownership of the\n\nten boxes. \n\n           After all  of the relevant  customs documents were\n\nprocessed, Rivera, Jose Rios, and United States Customs Agent\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nAngel  Luis Villegas  Lopez (\"Agent  Villegas\"), went  to the\n\nSanta Martina to unload its cargo.  As Jose Rios was carrying\n\none  of  the  boxes  off  the  boat,  Agent  Villegas  became\n\nsuspicious about its weight and decided to inspect it.  Agent\n\nVillegas opened one  of the boxes and  discovered powder that\n\nappeared to be cocaine.   Upon hearing that cocaine  may have\n\nbeen discovered, Jose Rios disclaimed ownership of the boxes,\n\nstated  that he  was  \"going to  look  for the  owners,\"  and\n\npromptly departed the scene.\n\n          Shortly  thereafter,  Agent  Villegas  conducted  a\n\nfield test  on the powder  in one  of the boxes.   That  test\n\nyielded a positive result for  cocaine.1  The government then\n\nseized the  Santa Martina, informing Rivera that  it would be\n\nheld  pending the  investigation.   Several  days later,  the\n\ngovernment  arrested Jose Rios, and began  its search for the\n\nas  yet unidentified woman who  had contracted with Rivera to\n\nship the ten boxes to  Fajardo.  The facts leading up  to the\n\nidentification ofEva Rios asthat person aresummarized below.2\n\n                    \n\n1.  A subsequent  field test  and laboratory analysis  of the\npowder in  the ten  boxes confirmed that  it was cocaine.   A\ngovernment witness  testified that the cocaine  had a \"street\nvalue\" of as much as 40 million dollars.\n\n2.

Apparently relying upon that\n\ninformation,  Agents Marti  and  Dania decided  to conduct  a\n\nshow-up   identification  procedure   using  Rivera   as  the\n\nidentifying witness  and Eva  Rios as the  potential suspect.\n\nTo that end,  on February  16, 1991, they  arranged with  Eva\n\nRios  to  meet them  in front  of  the United  States Customs\n\nBuilding  in  St.  Thomas.    Immediately  after  making  the\n\narrangements  with Eva  Rios, Agent  Marti phoned  Rivera and\n\ninstructed him to be at the United States Customs Building by\n\n11:30 a.m.  \n\n          Upon  Rivera's arrival,   Agent Marti  informed him\n\nthat a suspect, named \"Eva Rios,\" would be meeting the agents\n\non the steps of  the customs building sometime between  11:30\n\na.m.  and 12:00  p.m.   Marti also  informed Rivera  that the\n\npurpose of  Eva  Rios's visit  was to  allow him  to make  an\n\nidentification of her.   Rivera  was instructed to  sit in  a\n\nparked car  across the street from the  customs building, and\n\nto signal the agents with a white handkerchief as  soon as he\n\n                    \n\ndescribes her skin color.   \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\ncould positively identify her as the woman with whom he spoke\n\non the morning of February 8, 1991.\n\n          At some  point between  11:30 a.m. and  12:00 p.m.,\n\nEva Rios  arrived at the customs building.   Rivera testified\n\nthat  he saw her as she drove by,  as she parked her car, and\n\nagain as she walked by his  parked car.  He did not, however,\n\ngive a signal  to the officers until she  walked up to Agents\n\nMarti and Dania, shook their hands, and sat down next to them\n\non the stairs of  the customs building.  Based  upon Rivera's\n\npositive identification  of Eva Rios, Agents  Marti and Dania\n\narrested her on the spot.\n\n          The record  reveals that  February 16, 1991,  was a\n\nSaturday, Eva Rios's car was  the only car that drove  by the\n\ncustoms building  during the  time Rivera  was in  his parked\n\ncar,  and,  while  several  women  \"passed  by\"  the  customs\n\nbuilding during that time, only Eva Rios stopped to talk with\n\nthe  agents.  Agents Marti and Dania also testified that they\n\nwould not  have arrested Eva  Rios but for  Rivera's positive\n\nidentification of  her.   Subsequently, on or  about February\n\n22,  1991,  the  government  returned the  Santa  Martina  to\n\nRivera.\n\n          On  February  25,  1991,  Rivera  and  Mejias  were\n\nbrought  to an  office in  the customs  building and  shown a\n\nphoto-spread  of six photographs, one of  which was Eva Rios.\n\nBoth Rivera  and Mejias  positively identified Eva  Rios from\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nthe  photo  spread.    After  Rivera and  Mejias  made  their\n\nrespective identifications, Agent Marti, the agent  in charge\n\nof  the procedure,  asked  both of  them  to sign  affidavits\n\nattesting  to the  results.    They  also included  in  their\n\naffidavits an  additional description of the  woman with whom\n\nthey spoke on February  8.  Rivera described her as  \"a young\n\nwoman  . . . with  dark hair, light  brown complexion, thirty\n\nyears old . . . and somewhat fat.\"  Mejias described her as a\n\nlady  \"with light brown  skin, of average  height .  . . dark\n\nhair and a little fat.\"  \n\n          Agent Marti testified  that Rivera and  Mejias made\n\ntheir   identifications  at   different   times  and   \"never\n\nencountered each  other at the office.\"4   When asked whether\n\nhe had  had any discussions  with Rivera about  the incident,\n\nMejias testified that  he ended  his employment  relationship\n\nwith  Rivera on  February 8,  1991, and  had not  seen Rivera\n\nbetween  that date  and February  25, 1991,  the date  of the\n\nphoto spread identification.   During their  trial testimony,\n\nRivera and  Mejias also made in-court  identifications of Eva\n\nRios as the woman with whom they spoke on February 8, 1991.\n\n                    \n\n4.  Agent  Marti's testimony  on this question  was, however,\ncontradicted by Mejias, who testified  during the suppression\nhearing  that,  on February  25, he  and  Rivera were  at the\noffice  at the same  time but  went into  the office  to make\ntheir  identifications separately.    Mejias testified  that,\nwhile he  waited in the hall to be called into the office, he\nsaw Rivera walk into and out of the office.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          At trial,  both defendants took the  stand in their\n\nown defense.  Jose Rios  testified that he had been  asked by\n\nhis cousin,  Evaristo Rios (Eva  Rios's brother), to  pick up\n\nthe  boxes on  board  the  Santa  Martina.    He  denied  any\n\nknowledge that  the boxes contained cocaine,  and claimed not\n\nto have spoken with Eva Rios  for seven or eight years.  When\n\nasked  why he signed the  customs document as  the \"owner\" of\n\nthe ten boxes, he stated  that he did so in order to  pick up\n\nthe boxes for his cousin.\n\n          As well as arguing  that she had been misidentified\n\nby  Rivera and Mejias,  Eva Rios presented  an alibi defense.\n\nEssentially, her alibi witnesses testified that she could not\n\nhave  been  on  the St.  Thomas  waterfront  at  the time  in\n\nquestion.  One witness,  who worked at the school  Eva Rios's\n\ndaughter  attends,  remembered  Eva  Rios  dropping  off  her\n\ndaughter  at the school at  around 7:30 a.m.,  on February 8,\n\n1991.    An  employee  at  Eva  Rios's  place  of  employment\n\ntestified that Eva Rios was at work on February 8, 1991,  and\n\nusually arrived at  work between  8:00-8:10 a.m.   A  traffic\n\nofficer  in St. Thomas  further testified that,  based on the\n\ncommon traffic conditions  in St. Thomas, Eva  Rios would not\n\nhave  been able to travel  from her daughter's  school to the\n\nwaterfront  and then to her office between 7:30 a.m. and 8:10\n\na.m. \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          On April 30, 1991, the jury found Jose and Eva Rios\n\nguilty  on both  counts.   Jose  Rios  was sentenced  to  210\n\nmonths, and Eva Rios  to 188 months, of imprisonment.   These\n\nappeals followed.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\nA.

She  also argues  that  Rivera's\n\nFebruary  25, 1991,  and  his  in-court identifications  were\n\ntainted   by  the   previous   identification,  and   should,\n\ntherefore, also have been kept from the jury.5    \n\n          We  will  uphold a  district  court's  denial of  a\n\nmotion  to suppress  if any  reasonable view of  the evidence\n\nsupports it.

After a close review of  the record,\n       \n\nwe agree with the district court's conclusion that the showup\n\nprocedure  was impermissibly suggestive but disagree with its\n\ndetermination  that  Rivera's  identification  was  otherwise\n\nreliable.  While application of the first, second,  and fifth\n\nfactors  enumerated above  does not  give us  pause,6  we are\n\ntroubled  by  application of  the  third  and fourth  factors\n\n(i.e., the accuracy of the witness's prior description of the\n     \n\ncriminal,   and  the   level   of  certainty   that   witness\n\ndemonstrated at the confrontation) to the facts of this case.\n\nAgent  Marti testified  that,  on the  date  the cocaine  was\n\ndiscovered, February 8, 1991, Rivera described the suspect as\n\n\"white\"  and  approximately  five   feet,  two  inches  tall.\n\nRivera's  testimony  at  the  suppression hearing  and  Agent\n\nDania's trial testimony revealed that during his February 11,\n\n1991, interview with Agent  Dania, Rivera again described her\n\nas \"white.\"  It  was not until  after the February 16,  1991,\n\nshowup  that Rivera  described the  suspect as  having \"light\n\n                    \n\n6.  It  is clear from the  record that Rivera  had ample time\n(at least five  minutes) to view the suspect on  the date the\narrangements were made to  ship the purported detergent, that\nhe paid  some degree of attention to  the person at the time,\nand  that eight days between the date of the cocaine shipment\nand the showup was not unreasonable.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nbrown\" skin.7   Moreover, Rivera  also failed  to provide  an\n\naccurate description of her height (five feet, six inches) at\n\neither of his pre-showup descriptions.8\n\n          The  record  also contains  uncontroverted evidence\n\nthat, despite  having been  asked at  the February  16, 1991,\n\nshowup to signal the agents when he positively identified Eva\n\nRios, Rivera waited until after she approached the agents and\n\nbegan speaking with them (as scheduled) to signal.  We hardly\n\nthink  that this  constitutes a  high degree of  certainty on\n\nRivera's part, particularly in  light of the showup procedure\n\nat issue here.   Prior  to that showup,  Rivera was  informed\n\nthat  the agents  were meeting  the suspect  in front  of the\n\ncustoms building at a specific time.  While a few other women\n\nalso may  have walked by  the customs building  that morning,\n\nonly Eva Rios stopped to speak with the agents.9  \n    \n\n                    \n\n7.  Accordingly, the  district court's finding that there was\n\"no significant  difference\" between Rivera's  pre-showup and\npost-showup descriptions of the suspect is clearly erroneous.\n\n8.  During  the suppression  hearing, Agent  Marti --  who is\napproximately five feet, seven inches tall -- testified that,\non February 8, 1991, Rivera described the suspect as being \"a\nlittle bit more  or less like my  [Agent Marti] height.\"   At\ntrial, however, he admitted that, on February 8, 1991, Rivera\ndescribed the suspect as five feet, two inches tall.\n\n9.  Our    analysis   of   the    reliability   of   Rivera's\nidentification is further informed by the undisputed evidence\nthat the  government seized Rivera's boat, his only source of\nlivelihood, on the date  of the crime, and informed  him that\nhe  would  receive  it  only after  their  investigation  was\ncompleted.    The record  also  reveals  that the  government\nreturned his  boat  less  than  a  week  after  his  positive\nidentification  of Eva Rios.  We think that these facts, when\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n          Based upon the  above analysis, therefore, we  find\n\nthat    Rivera's    pretrial   identifications    were   both\n\nimpermissibly suggestive and unreliable.

Outside of Rivera's testimony,\n\nthe only other evidence linking Eva Rios to the crime was the\n\ntestimony  of  Mejias,  Rivera's  brother-in-law  and  former\n\nemployee.   Mejias testified that  he spoke with  the suspect\n\nfor approximately  fifteen minutes  on February 7,  1991, the\n\nday before  the crime.   He  spoke with  her  again the  next\n\nmorning  when she  inquired  about Rivera's  whereabouts, and\n\nwitnessed the subsequent conversation between her and Rivera.\n\nHe gave descriptions of her on February 8, 12, 25, and during\n\nhis trial testimony.  Despite having described her skin color\n\nas \"white\" on both February 8 and 12, he selected her picture\n\non February 25, from a photo spread with photos of five other\n\nwomen with  similar characteristics.   Also on that  date, he\n\n                    \n\nplaced alongside  the one-person showup and  Rivera's belated\nidentification, cast serious further doubt on the reliability\n                            \nof that identification.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\ndescribed her  as having  \"light brown skin.\"   Additionally,\n\nduring his trial testimony, he identified her in court as the\n\nwoman he spoke with on February 7 and 8.\n\n          Although the harmless  error question is  close, we\n\ncannot conclude -- under the particular circumstances of this\n\ncase  -- that  the  error was  harmless  beyond a  reasonable\n\ndoubt.  First,  there is no  way for us  to discern the  role\n\nthat   Rivera's   identification   played   in   the   jury's\n\ndeliberations.   We are concerned that the jury may have been\n\npersuaded to convict  by the  very fact that  there were  two\n                                                             \n\nwitnesses  who identified Eva Rios.  It is also possible that\n\nthe  jury  relied solely  upon  the  testimony of  Rivera  in\n\nreaching  its conclusion.    Thus, we  find reasonable  doubt\n\nexists as to whether  the jury would have convicted  Eva Rios\n\nbased solely upon  Mejias's identification testimony.10   See\n                                                             \n\nClark v.

We  note that  there  exists  at  least some  basis  for\nquestioning Mejias's testimony that  his photo-spread and in-\ncourt  identifications of  Eva  Rios were  not influenced  by\nRivera's  showup  identification.    Mejias and  Rivera  were\nbrothers-in-law of more than thirty years who worked together\non Rivera's  boat.  Despite their  close relationship, Mejias\ntestified that he had no contact with Rivera between February\n8,  1991,  (the date  on which  he  and Rivera  described the\nsuspect as having \"white\" skin), and February  25, 1991, (the\ndate  on  which they  both  described the  suspect  as having\n\"light  brown\" skin  and selected  Eva Rios's picture  from a\nphoto-spread).   This testimony,  coupled with the  fact that\nMejias offered no explanation as to what caused him to change\nhis description of the suspect, may well have led the jury to\ndoubt his credibility on this critical question.   \n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nbe `no reasonable doubt' that the jury would have reached the\n\nsame  verdict without having  received the tainted evidence\")\n\n(quoting  Milton v.
