The  remaining two  panelists\ntherefore issue this opinion pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   46(d).\n\n          BREYER,  Chief Judge.  American Airlines appeals a\n                              \n\njudgment requiring  it to pay approximately  $22,000 to Hill\n\nConstruction Corporation  as a  result of  American's having\n\ntemporarily lost, and then  damaged, a helicopter blade that\n\nHill  had  asked  American  to  ship  from  Puerto  Rico  to\n\nCalifornia.     American  does  not  contest   the  fact  of\n\nliability.   Rather,  it argues  that the  court  lacked the\n\npower to award damages  greater than the maximum permissible\n\nunder a contract provision limiting American's liability for\n\ncargo \"lost, damaged or delayed\" to $9.07 per pound (a total\n\nof $1,814  in this case).  The district court found that the\n\n\"liability limitation\" did not apply.  In our view, however,\n\nthe  limitation  is  valid   and  applicable.    And,  well-\n\nestablished  legal  principles  require  us  to  reverse the\n\ndistrict court's determination.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          The  record,  read favorably  to  Hill,  shows the\n\nfollowing: \n\n          1)   On  August  10,  1990,  a  Hill  Construction\n               employee  brought  a   helicopter  blade   to\n               American  Airlines'  cargo  terminal  in  San\n               Juan,  Puerto  Rico,  and signed  (on  Hill's\n               behalf)  an  American  \"air  waybill\"   --  a\n\n               contract that obliged American, in return for\n               payment, to ship the blade to California.\n\n          2)   The  air  waybill  said  on  its   face  that\n               provisions  on  its   \"reverse  side\"   would\n               \"limit\"   American's  \"liability   for  loss,\n               damage, or delay in  certain instances.\"  The\n               reverse side  said, among other  things, that\n               American's   liability   for   cargo   \"lost,\n               damaged, or delayed\" was limited to $9.07 per\n               pound  (plus  transportation charges)  unless\n               the shipper declared a  higher value and paid\n               an additional charge. Hill's employee did not\n               fill in the \"declared value\" box on the front\n               of  the bill,  nor did  the employee,  in any\n               other way, declare  a higher  value, nor  did\n               the employee pay any additional charge.\n\n          3)   American  accepted the blade for carriage and\n               promptly lost the blade.\n\n          4)   About seven months later, in March 1991, in a\n               San Juan air  cargo warehouse  near the  sea,\n               American found  a  crate containing  what  it\n               thought was the missing blade.   It contacted\n               Hill's \"administrator,\" Ms. Dorothy Hill, who\n               came to the warehouse.  An American  employee\n               (contrary to Ms. Hill's advice) began to open\n               the crate with a  forklift.  Inside, Ms. Hill\n               found  the  missing blade,  seriously damaged\n               both  by the  forklift and  by the  salty sea\n               air. \n\n          After these events, Hill Construction brought this\n\nlawsuit against American.  After a trial, the district court\n\nfound  American \"negligent  in the  handling  of plaintiff's\n\ncargo.\"    It decided that  the liability limitation  either\n\nwas invalid or, alternatively, did not apply to so serious a\n\nviolation  of  the   transportation  contract.     And,   it\n\nconsequently  awarded  full compensatory  damages  of almost\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n$22,000,  the value of the blade.  American now appeals this\n\ndamage award.\n\n                             II\n\n                          The Law\n                                 \n\n          Where air carriage contracts set forth limitations\n\non  carrier cargo liability  in a \"reasonably communicative\"\n\nform and offer the shipper a choice of  paying a higher rate\n\nfor greater protection,  federal courts have  normally found\n\nthose  limitations lawful.

(3)\n                                                       \n\nstatutes allowing limitations on  liability, e.g., 46 U.S.C.\n                                                 \n\n   1304(5) (carriage of goods at sea); 49 U.S.C.    10505(e)\n\n(rail carriers), 10730(b)(1) (motor  transport), 11707(c)(4)\n\n(common carriers).  \n\n          In  a  commercial  context, liability  limitations\n\nhave  certain advantages.   They permit  a carrier  to avoid\n\nunforeseeably high liability for especially  valuable cargo;\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nthey permit shippers of ordinary items to pay somewhat lower\n\nfreight bills; and they permit shippers of valuable items to\n\nchoose between  paying an  insurance premium to  the carrier\n\nand obtaining,  perhaps less  expensive, insurance  on their\n\nown.   See Husman  Constr. Co., 832  F.2d at  462; cf.  Alan\n                                                      \n\nSchwartz  &amp; Robert E.  Scott, Commercial Transactions 122-23\n                                                     \n\n(1991).  On  the other hand,  such clauses risk  unfairness,\n\nwhere,  for example, a shipper  is, in fact,  unaware of the\n\nlimitation  and  his  choices.   Yet,  the  requirements  of\n\nreasonably communicative  notice and  an opportunity  to buy\n\nincreased  coverage for a premium payment lessen the risk of\n\nunfairness.  And, as we  have said, balancing advantages and\n\ndisadvantages,  both Congress and  the courts  have approved\n\nthe use of such clauses. \n\n          The contract before  us contains typical, standard\n\nform clauses  which reasonably communicate the limitation on\n\nliability.  The reverse side of the \"air waybill\" contains a\n\nseries  of  clauses   setting  forth  transport  conditions,\n\nwritten in  ordinary sized  print and separated  by spacing.\n\nOn the  copy submitted  at trial, these  clauses are  fairly\n\neasy  to read (except for the blurring of a few non-critical\n\nwords that may reflect poor duplication).  The clauses  make\n\nclear that the  carrier limits its liability  for cargo that\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nis \"lost, damaged or  delayed\" to $9.07 per pound,  but that\n\nthe shipper may  avoid the limitation by declaring  a higher\n\nvalue and paying  a greater charge.   The front side  of the\n\nbill clearly refers the reader to the  back of the bill, for\n\nit  says, in  ordinary  sized type,  set  forth clearly  and\n\nseparately from other words on the page:\n\n          This nonnegotiable airbill is a contract\n          governed by Law and by the provisions on\n          the  reverse  side.    Such  provisions,\n          among\n          other  things,  exclude  or   limit  the\n          Carrier's liability for loss,  damage or\n          delay in certain circumstances.\n\nThe front side  of the  bill also contains  a box  captioned\n\n\"declared  value,\" which, in this case, was left blank.  Cf.\n                                                            \n\nFederal Express v. Paris  Business Forms, Inc., 46 Pa.  D. &amp;\n                                              \n\nC.  3d 262  (1988) (standard  provisions clearly  printed on\n\nfront and reverse of airbill afforded sufficient opportunity\n\nto declare higher value).    \n\n          Ms. Hill  testified that American's agent  did not\n\ntell  either  her  or   her  employee  about  the  liability\n\nlimitation clauses, and that, in fact,  neither she, nor her\n\nemployee, knew about such  clauses.  But, we do  not believe\n\nthat, in  these factual circumstances,  American was obliged\n\nto call the liability limitation to its customers' attention\n\norally.  The  context is commercial.   Hill Construction had\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nbeen in business  in Puerto  Rico for eighteen  years.   Its\n\nemployees  had  previously  shipped  helicopter  parts  from\n\nPuerto  Rico to the mainland.  In this context, a reasonably\n\nprominent  writing, not  in  particularly  small print,  set\n\nforth  with reasonable  clarity on  the front  of a  printed\n\nairbill, would seem sufficient to communicate  the liability\n\nlimitation,  or  at  least  to impose  upon  the  commercial\n\ncustomer a further obligation to read (rather than to impose\n\nupon the carrier a  further obligation to point to)  what is\n\nwritten. See Husman  Constr. Co.,  832 F.2d  at 461  (citing\n                                \n\nFirst Pennsylvania Bank, 731 F.2d at 1115); cf. Hopper Furs,\n                                                            \n\nInc.  v.

The contract  makes\n\nclear  that the carrier can  declare a higher  value and buy\n\nfull  coverage for an additional  fee.  Hill  has offered no\n\nevidence  to  suggest  that  the  amount  of  this  fee  for\n\nadditional  cargo  protection was  unreasonable  for  an air\n\ncarrier in American's market.\n\n          This  valid liability  limitation  applies in  the\n\npresent  situation. The  provisions refer  to cargo  that is\n\n\"lost, damaged or delayed,\"  and the circumstances here fall\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nwithin this language.  The clause is enforceable despite the\n\nfact  that American  may  never have  put  the blade  on  an\n\nairplane.   A remedial contract clause, such as this one, is\n\ndesigned  to  take  effect  precisely where,  as  here,  the\n\ncarrier has  broken the basic  carriage contract.   As Judge\n\nKaufman pointed out more than forty years ago, \n\n          Only in case of a misdelivery, negligent\n          injury, loss or similar  misfortune does\n          a valuation clause come into use.  Hence\n          the  Federal  courts  have rightly  held\n          that the limitation of  liability clause\n          is  designed  for  and  does  survive  a\n          breach of the contract of carriage.\n\nLichten  v.  Eastern Airlines,  Inc.,  87  F.Supp. 691,  697\n                                    \n\n(S.D.N.Y. 1949).

A  special  contract   provision  gave  a\n\npassenger  the  right to  carry  valuables  in the  airplane\n\ncabin; the airline  refused to  allow a widow  to carry  her\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nhusband's ashes in  the cabin; the  airline lost the  ashes;\n\nand   the  court  (in  a  brief  per  curiam  opinion)  held\n                                            \n\ninapplicable  a provision  limiting the  airline's liability\n\nfor  loss  of valuables.    Unlike this  case,  the Coughlin\n                                                            \n\ncontract  involved a  separate, liability-limitation-related\n\ncontractual promise,  namely  a promise  that the  passenger\n\nmight  personally monitor  the  safety of  the valuables  by\n\ncarrying  them in the cabin.   One might  read the liability\n\nlimitation as  conditioned on  fulfillment of that  promise.\n\nSee 2  Goods in Transit    13.07[4] at 13-90 &amp;  n.49.  Then,\n                       \n\nsince  the carrier did not permit the passenger to carry the\n                          \n\nashes, it failed to satisfy the condition, and the liability\n\nlimitation did not take effect.  See id. at 1433.  We do not\n                                        \n\nsee how otherwise, consistent  with prior authority, to read\n\nthis  case.   See, e.g.,  Pinion v.  Dow Chemical,  928 F.2d\n                                                 \n\n1522, 1536 (11th  Cir.) (case should  be read as  consistent\n\nwith prior precedent if possible), cert. denied,  112 S. Ct.\n                                               \n\n438 (1991).  And, as  so read, the case provides no  support\n\nfor Hill's claim here,  where there is no  relevant special,\n\nliability-limitation-related  condition   that  the  carrier\n\nfailed  to  fulfill.   As  we  have  just  pointed out,  the\n\ncontract  here does  not condition the  liability limitation\n\nupon the carrier's satisfying  its basic, general promise to\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ntransport  the  goods, for  the  parties  normally intend  a\n\nliability limitation  to apply, not to  disappear, when this\n\ntype of general promise is breached.  See pp. 8-9, supra.\n                                                        \n\n          Hill makes  one further argument.  It  points to a\n\nlegal  doctrine,  called  the  \"deviation  doctrine,\"  which\n\noriginated in maritime law.   Applying that doctrine, courts\n\nwould  hold  liability limitations  inapplicable  when ships\n\ndeparted significantly from prearranged routes that they had\n\npromised to take.  See 2  Goods in Transit   13.13[1] at 13-\n                                          \n\n140-42  and cases cited therein.   Hill has  found two state\n                               \n\ncases, construing  federal law, which applied  this doctrine\n\noutside the maritime context, where  the carrier acted so as\n\n\"fundamentally\"  to  change  the  foreseeable  risks to  the\n\ncargo.  See,  e.g.,  Information  Control  Corp.  v.  United\n                                                            \n\nAirlines  Corp., 73 Cal.

But see Grant Gilmore  &amp; Charles L.  Black, Jr., The\n                                                            \n\nLaw of Admiralty    3-42  at 182 (2d  ed. 1975)  (\"deviation\n                \n\ndoctrine\"   limited  to   geographic  departures).     Given\n                                    \n\nAmerican's seriously  negligent  conduct, says  Hill,  those\n\nstate cases require us to invoke the \"deviation doctrine\" to\n\nset aside the liability limitation here. \n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n          We do  not  believe,  however,  that  these  cases\n\nrequire the result  for which Hill  argues.  In each  of the\n\nstate cases, the carrier made a special, separate promise to\n\nthe shipper about special conditions of carriage designed to\n\nlessen the risk  of harm to the  shipper's particular cargo.\n\nIn the  first  case, United  Airlines  promised  Information\n\nControl  Corporation (and  later  specially confirmed  in  a\n\ntelephone  conversation)  that  it  would  place Information\n\nControl's  computers on  a specific  flight and  fly without\n\nstopovers.  See Information Control, 73 Cal. App. 3d at 632-\n                                   \n\n33.   In the second case, Flying Tiger specifically promised\n\nPhilco that  it would store its  computer materials upright.\n\nSee Philco Corp., 171 N.W.2d at 17-18.  We suspect  that, as\n                \n\nin  Coughlin, the  state courts  saw failure  to live  up to\n            \n\nthese  separate,  risk-related   promises  (special  to  the\n\nparticular shipment at issue)  as a \"fundamental\"  departure\n\nfrom conditions  precedent  to the  \"boilerplate\"  liability\n\nlimitation's  taking effect.   See  Restatement (Second)  of\n                                                            \n\nContracts   203(c)  &amp; cmt. e  (specific provisions or  later\n         \n\nadditions supersede more general contract language); Baloise\n                                                            \n\nIns.

American Airlines appeals a\n                              \n\njudgment requiring  it to pay approximately  $22,000 to Hill\n\nConstruction Corporation  as a  result of  American's having\n\ntemporarily lost, and then  damaged, a helicopter blade that\n\nHill  had  asked  American  to  ship  from  Puerto  Rico  to\n\nCalifornia.     American  does  not  contest   the  fact  of\n\nliability.   Rather,  it argues  that the  court  lacked the\n\npower to award damages  greater than the maximum permissible\n\nunder a contract provision limiting American's liability for\n\ncargo \"lost, damaged or delayed\" to $9.07 per pound (a total\n\nof $1,814  in this case).  The district court found that the\n\n\"liability limitation\" did not apply.  In our view, however,\n\nthe  limitation  is  valid   and  applicable.    And,  well-\n\nestablished  legal  principles  require  us  to  reverse the\n\ndistrict court's determination.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          The  record,  read favorably  to  Hill,  shows the\n\nfollowing: \n\n          1)   On  August  10,  1990,  a  Hill  Construction\n               employee  brought  a   helicopter  blade   to\n               American  Airlines'  cargo  terminal  in  San\n               Juan,  Puerto  Rico,  and signed  (on  Hill's\n               behalf)  an  American  \"air  waybill\"   --  a\n\n               contract that obliged American, in return for\n               payment, to ship the blade to California.\n\n          2)   The  air  waybill  said  on  its   face  that\n               provisions  on  its   \"reverse  side\"   would\n               \"limit\"   American's  \"liability   for  loss,\n               damage, or delay in  certain instances.\"  The\n               reverse side  said, among other  things, that\n               American's   liability   for   cargo   \"lost,\n               damaged, or delayed\" was limited to $9.07 per\n               pound  (plus  transportation charges)  unless\n               the shipper declared a  higher value and paid\n               an additional charge. Hill's employee did not\n               fill in the \"declared value\" box on the front\n               of  the bill,  nor did  the employee,  in any\n               other way, declare  a higher  value, nor  did\n               the employee pay any additional charge.\n\n          3)   American  accepted the blade for carriage and\n               promptly lost the blade.\n\n          4)   About seven months later, in March 1991, in a\n               San Juan air  cargo warehouse  near the  sea,\n               American found  a  crate containing  what  it\n               thought was the missing blade.   It contacted\n               Hill's \"administrator,\" Ms. Dorothy Hill, who\n               came to the warehouse.  An American  employee\n               (contrary to Ms. Hill's advice) began to open\n               the crate with a  forklift.  Inside, Ms. Hill\n               found  the  missing blade,  seriously damaged\n               both  by the  forklift and  by the  salty sea\n               air. \n\n          After these events, Hill Construction brought this\n\nlawsuit against American.  After a trial, the district court\n\nfound  American \"negligent  in the  handling  of plaintiff's\n\ncargo.\"    It decided that  the liability limitation  either\n\nwas invalid or, alternatively, did not apply to so serious a\n\nviolation  of  the   transportation  contract.     And,   it\n\nconsequently  awarded  full compensatory  damages  of almost\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n$22,000,  the value of the blade.  American now appeals this\n\ndamage award.\n\n                             II\n\n                          The Law\n                                 \n\n          Where air carriage contracts set forth limitations\n\non  carrier cargo liability  in a \"reasonably communicative\"\n\nform and offer the shipper a choice of  paying a higher rate\n\nfor greater protection,  federal courts have  normally found\n\nthose  limitations lawful.

They permit  a carrier  to avoid\n\nunforeseeably high liability for especially  valuable cargo;\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nthey permit shippers of ordinary items to pay somewhat lower\n\nfreight bills; and they permit shippers of valuable items to\n\nchoose between  paying an  insurance premium to  the carrier\n\nand obtaining,  perhaps less  expensive, insurance  on their\n\nown.   See Husman  Constr. Co., 832  F.2d at  462; cf.  Alan\n                                                      \n\nSchwartz  &amp; Robert E.

On  the other hand,  such clauses risk  unfairness,\n\nwhere,  for example, a shipper  is, in fact,  unaware of the\n\nlimitation  and  his  choices.   Yet,  the  requirements  of\n\nreasonably communicative  notice and  an opportunity  to buy\n\nincreased  coverage for a premium payment lessen the risk of\n\nunfairness.  And, as we  have said, balancing advantages and\n\ndisadvantages,  both Congress and  the courts  have approved\n\nthe use of such clauses. \n\n          The contract before  us contains typical, standard\n\nform clauses  which reasonably communicate the limitation on\n\nliability.  The reverse side of the \"air waybill\" contains a\n\nseries  of  clauses   setting  forth  transport  conditions,\n\nwritten in  ordinary sized  print and separated  by spacing.\n\nOn the  copy submitted  at trial, these  clauses are  fairly\n\neasy  to read (except for the blurring of a few non-critical\n\nwords that may reflect poor duplication).  The clauses  make\n\nclear that the  carrier limits its liability  for cargo that\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nis \"lost, damaged or  delayed\" to $9.07 per pound,  but that\n\nthe shipper may  avoid the limitation by declaring  a higher\n\nvalue and paying  a greater charge.   The front side  of the\n\nbill clearly refers the reader to the  back of the bill, for\n\nit  says, in  ordinary  sized type,  set  forth clearly  and\n\nseparately from other words on the page:\n\n          This nonnegotiable airbill is a contract\n          governed by Law and by the provisions on\n          the  reverse  side.    Such  provisions,\n          among\n          other  things,  exclude  or   limit  the\n          Carrier's liability for loss,  damage or\n          delay in certain circumstances.\n\nThe front side  of the  bill also contains  a box  captioned\n\n\"declared  value,\" which, in this case, was left blank.  Cf.\n                                                            \n\nFederal Express v. Paris  Business Forms, Inc., 46 Pa.  D. &amp;\n                                              \n\nC.  3d 262  (1988) (standard  provisions clearly  printed on\n\nfront and reverse of airbill afforded sufficient opportunity\n\nto declare higher value).    \n\n          Ms. Hill  testified that American's agent  did not\n\ntell  either  her  or   her  employee  about  the  liability\n\nlimitation clauses, and that, in fact,  neither she, nor her\n\nemployee, knew about such  clauses.  But, we do  not believe\n\nthat, in  these factual circumstances,  American was obliged\n\nto call the liability limitation to its customers' attention\n\norally.  The  context is commercial.   Hill Construction had\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nbeen in business  in Puerto  Rico for eighteen  years.   Its\n\nemployees  had  previously  shipped  helicopter  parts  from\n\nPuerto  Rico to the mainland.  In this context, a reasonably\n\nprominent  writing, not  in  particularly  small print,  set\n\nforth  with reasonable  clarity on  the front  of a  printed\n\nairbill, would seem sufficient to communicate  the liability\n\nlimitation,  or  at  least  to impose  upon  the  commercial\n\ncustomer a further obligation to read (rather than to impose\n\nupon the carrier a  further obligation to point to)  what is\n\nwritten. See Husman  Constr. Co.,  832 F.2d  at 461  (citing\n                                \n\nFirst Pennsylvania Bank, 731 F.2d at 1115); cf. Hopper Furs,\n                                                            \n\nInc.  v.

The contract  makes\n\nclear  that the carrier can  declare a higher  value and buy\n\nfull  coverage for an additional  fee.  Hill  has offered no\n\nevidence  to  suggest  that  the  amount  of  this  fee  for\n\nadditional  cargo  protection was  unreasonable  for  an air\n\ncarrier in American's market.\n\n          This  valid liability  limitation  applies in  the\n\npresent  situation. The  provisions refer  to cargo  that is\n\n\"lost, damaged or delayed,\"  and the circumstances here fall\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nwithin this language.  The clause is enforceable despite the\n\nfact  that American  may  never have  put  the blade  on  an\n\nairplane.   A remedial contract clause, such as this one, is\n\ndesigned  to  take  effect  precisely where,  as  here,  the\n\ncarrier has  broken the basic  carriage contract.   As Judge\n\nKaufman pointed out more than forty years ago, \n\n          Only in case of a misdelivery, negligent\n          injury, loss or similar  misfortune does\n          a valuation clause come into use.  Hence\n          the  Federal  courts  have rightly  held\n          that the limitation of  liability clause\n          is  designed  for  and  does  survive  a\n          breach of the contract of carriage.\n\nLichten  v.

A  special  contract   provision  gave  a\n\npassenger  the  right to  carry  valuables  in the  airplane\n\ncabin; the airline  refused to  allow a widow  to carry  her\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nhusband's ashes in  the cabin; the  airline lost the  ashes;\n\nand   the  court  (in  a  brief  per  curiam  opinion)  held\n                                            \n\ninapplicable  a provision  limiting the  airline's liability\n\nfor  loss  of valuables.    Unlike this  case,  the Coughlin\n                                                            \n\ncontract  involved a  separate, liability-limitation-related\n\ncontractual promise,  namely  a promise  that the  passenger\n\nmight  personally monitor  the  safety of  the valuables  by\n\ncarrying  them in the cabin.   One might  read the liability\n\nlimitation as  conditioned on  fulfillment of that  promise.\n\nSee 2  Goods in Transit    13.07[4] at 13-90 &amp;  n.49.  Then,\n                       \n\nsince  the carrier did not permit the passenger to carry the\n                          \n\nashes, it failed to satisfy the condition, and the liability\n\nlimitation did not take effect.  See id. at 1433.  We do not\n                                        \n\nsee how otherwise, consistent  with prior authority, to read\n\nthis  case.   See, e.g.,  Pinion v.  Dow Chemical,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558011\"><a href=\"/opinion/558011/mr-jesse-pinion-mrs-jesse-pinion-maurice-daffron-shirley-daffron-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                 \n\n<span class=\"page\">1522</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1536 (11th  Cir.)

And, as  so read, the case provides no  support\n\nfor Hill's claim here,  where there is no  relevant special,\n\nliability-limitation-related  condition   that  the  carrier\n\nfailed  to  fulfill.   As  we  have  just  pointed out,  the\n\ncontract  here does  not condition the  liability limitation\n\nupon the carrier's satisfying  its basic, general promise to\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ntransport  the  goods, for  the  parties  normally intend  a\n\nliability limitation  to apply, not to  disappear, when this\n\ntype of general promise is breached.  See pp. 8-9, supra.\n                                                        \n\n          Hill makes  one further argument.  It  points to a\n\nlegal  doctrine,  called  the  \"deviation  doctrine,\"  which\n\noriginated in maritime law.   Applying that doctrine, courts\n\nwould  hold  liability limitations  inapplicable  when ships\n\ndeparted significantly from prearranged routes that they had\n\npromised to take.  See 2  Goods in Transit   13.13[1] at 13-\n                                          \n\n140-42  and cases cited therein.   Hill has  found two state\n                               \n\ncases, construing  federal law, which applied  this doctrine\n\noutside the maritime context, where  the carrier acted so as\n\n\"fundamentally\"  to  change  the  foreseeable  risks to  the\n\ncargo.  See,  e.g.,  Information  Control  Corp.  v.  United\n                                                            \n\nAirlines  Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2162582\"><a href=\"/opinion/2162582/information-control-corp-v-united-airlines-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Given\n                                    \n\nAmerican's seriously  negligent  conduct, says  Hill,  those\n\nstate cases require us to invoke the \"deviation doctrine\" to\n\nset aside the liability limitation here. \n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n          We do  not  believe,  however,  that  these  cases\n\nrequire the result  for which Hill  argues.  In each  of the\n\nstate cases, the carrier made a special, separate promise to\n\nthe shipper about special conditions of carriage designed to\n\nlessen the risk  of harm to the  shipper's particular cargo.\n\nIn the  first  case, United  Airlines  promised  Information\n\nControl  Corporation (and  later  specially confirmed  in  a\n\ntelephone  conversation)  that  it  would  place Information\n\nControl's  computers on  a specific  flight and  fly without\n\nstopovers.  See Information Control, 73 Cal. App. 3d at 632-\n                                   \n\n33.   In the second case, Flying Tiger specifically promised\n\nPhilco that  it would store its  computer materials upright.\n\nSee Philco Corp., 171 N.W.2d at 17-18.  We suspect  that, as\n                \n\nin  Coughlin, the  state courts  saw failure  to live  up to\n            \n\nthese  separate,  risk-related   promises  (special  to  the\n\nparticular shipment at issue)  as a \"fundamental\"  departure\n\nfrom conditions  precedent  to the  \"boilerplate\"  liability\n\nlimitation's  taking effect.   See  Restatement (Second)  of\n                                                            \n\nContracts   203(c)  &amp; cmt. e  (specific provisions or  later\n         \n\nadditions supersede more general contract language); Baloise\n                                                            \n\nIns.
