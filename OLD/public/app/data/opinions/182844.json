Alexander, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Boudin, Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     David M. Bryan, with whom Marshall F.

Although this appeal challenges\n\nthree rulings of the district court, it turns on only one of them:\n\nthe exclusion of expert testimony as a sanction for failure to\n\ncomply with the disclosure requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 26(a)(2)(B).    Because the expert in question was not an\n\nexpert   specially   retained    or   employed   for   the   purpose   of\n\ntestifying, we hold that the rule did not justify exclusion of the\n\nproffered testimony.    Finding that error prejudicial, we reverse.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           In 2005, the plaintiffs, Yvette Downey and her daughter,\n\nAshley Celester, were living in Randolph, Massachusetts.           Early\n\nthat year they began to experience skin irritation, which they\n\noriginally   attributed   to    allergies   or   infections.     In    the\n\ncrepuscular hours of July 24, 2005, they awoke to discover an\n\noutbreak of insects.    The parties agree in their briefs that some\n\nof the bugs were covering Ashley's body.1\n\n           Yvette Downey immediately called Allegiance Pest Control\n\nand spoke to the service manager, Edward Gordinier, a licensed and\n\nexperienced exterminator.       Gordinier inspected the plaintiffs'\n\nhome that day.    His inspection revealed \"bedbugs harboring in the\n\nbed frame,\" which had been purchased from the defendant, Bob's\n\n\n\n     1\n       Testimony in the record indicates that the bugs may actually\nhave been swarming over the body of a visiting cousin. For present\npurposes, the difference is inconsequential, so we do not try to\nresolve it.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fDiscount Furniture Holdings, Inc., as part of a children's bedroom\n\nset.   The defendant delivered the set on December 29, 2004.\n\n           Contemporaneous with the inspection, Gordinier prepared\n\nan incident report summarizing his findings.            Pertinently, the\n\nreport stated:\n\n           I inspected the entire apartment for insect\n           activity. I found a moderate infestation of\n           bed bugs throughout the house.      The main\n           source of activity is coming from [Ashley\n           Celester's] room. It appears as though they\n           have been carried to other areas of the house\n           unknowingly.   I recommend the entire house\n           receive treatment immediately.\n\n           Yvette Downey promptly informed the defendant of the\n\nbedbug infestation.         Moreover, on the day after his initial\n\ninspection,     Gordinier   sent   a   facsimile    transmission   to   the\n\ndefendant.      The fax reported his findings and encouraged the\n\ndefendant to defray the costs of extermination.          Consistent with\n\nits return policy, the defendant retrieved and destroyed the\n\nallegedly offending furniture and refunded the purchase price. It\n\ndid not agree to pay for the costs of extermination.\n\n           At   the   plaintiffs'      request,   Gordinier   subsequently\n\ncarried out the needed extermination treatments.          The plaintiffs\n\nallege that they experienced lasting health problems, emotional\n\ndistress, and economic loss as a result of the entomological\n\nepisode.\n\n           Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1),\n\nthe plaintiffs sued in the United States District Court for the\n\n                                    -3-\n\fDistrict of Massachusetts. The operative pleading — their amended\n\ncomplaint — asserted claims for negligence, breach of implied\n\nwarranties      of     fitness     for      a     particular        purpose    and\n\nmerchantability,       and   violations     of    a    Massachusetts     consumer\n\nprotection law.       The defendant denied fault.\n\n          On June 4, 2007, the parties agreed to proceed before a\n\nmagistrate judge.       See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c); Fed. R. Civ. P. 73(a).\n\nThe magistrate judge (whom we hereafter shall refer to as the\n\ndistrict court) gave the parties until November 14, 2007 to\n\ndesignate experts.           On the very day on which that deadline\n\nexpired, the plaintiffs designated their exterminator, Gordinier,\n\nas an expert.        This disclosure related that Gordinier would \"be\n\nused by [the plaintiffs] to give opinion testimony and otherwise\n\npresent evidence under F.R.E. 702, 703 and/or 705.\"\n\n          Although the plaintiffs named Gordinier (who, in all\n\nevents, had previously been listed as a fact witness), they did\n\nnot   produce    a    written     report    delineating       the    details    of\n\nGordinier's     anticipated      testimony,      nor   did   they    specify   his\n\nqualifications.       Instead, they asserted that Gordinier had not\n\nbeen retained or specially employed as an expert (and that,\n\ntherefore, no such supplemental disclosures were required).\n\n          At     subsequent      pretrial       conferences,    the     defendant\n\nmaintained that the plaintiffs' disclosure was incomplete without\n\na written report.       The plaintiffs continued to demur.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f          At a conference held on April 10, 2008, the plaintiffs\n\nrepresented that they would call Gordinier as an expert witness on\n\nthe issue of causation.    His opinion would be offered to show that\n\nthe bedbugs probably had been delivered along with the purchased\n\nbedroom set.   The plaintiffs' lawyer stated that Gordinier based\n\nthis conclusion on his observation that the bedbugs were harboring\n\nin the bed frame and on his specialized knowledge that bedbugs\n\nwere capable of living dormant and without feeding for many\n\nmonths.\n\n          Forewarned by this representation, the defendant noticed\n\nGordinier's    deposition.     It    then     canceled     the   scheduled\n\ndeposition, explaining that neither Gordinier's findings nor his\n\nqualifications had been adequately disclosed.\n\n          As   trial   approached,   the    case   was   reassigned   to   a\n\ndifferent magistrate judge.    The defendant subsequently filed two\n\nmotions in limine.      The first sought preclusion of Gordinier's\n\nopinion on causation.    The second sought preclusion of evidence of\n\nthirty-six customer complaints that the defendant had received\n\nbetween 2004 and 2006.\n\n          The district court heard arguments and granted both\n\nmotions. The court grounded its preclusion of Gordinier's opinion\n\ntestimony on the plaintiffs' failure to submit a written report as\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\frequired by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B).2               As to\n\nthe second motion, the court found the customer complaint evidence\n\nnot relevant and, in any event, more prejudicial than probative.\n\n           Trial commenced on July 27, 2009. The plaintiffs called\n\nGordinier as their first witness.          After he had related details of\n\nhis inspection of the premises, he was asked whether he had formed\n\nan opinion as to the source of the bedbug infestation.            He replied\n\nin the affirmative.      Upon the defendant's objection to admission\n\nof that opinion, the court reaffirmed its pretrial ruling and\n\nprohibited   the   plaintiffs     from     pursuing    Gordinier's    opinion\n\ntestimony as to the cause of the infestation.\n\n           In   addition    to   fact    testimony     from   Gordinier,   the\n\nplaintiffs themselves testified and they introduced the deposition\n\nof   the   defendant's     manager   of     delivery    operations.        This\n\ndeposition testimony revealed that the defendant had no written\n\npolicy anent the prevention of bedbug infestations.                   It also\n\nrevealed that used bedding retrieved from customers' homes was\n\nroutinely hauled in the same trucks and at the same times as new\n\nfurniture to be delivered.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       Relatedly, the court ordered the plaintiffs to provide the\ndefendant with a copy of Gordinier's curriculum vitae and an\nenumeration of all other cases in which he had testified. See Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B).      In response to this directive, the\nplaintiffs furnished a document stating that Gordinier had no\ncurriculum vitae and had not previously testified. That ruling and\nresponse are not in issue on this appeal.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f               At the close of the plaintiffs' case in chief, the\n\ndefendant moved for judgment as a matter of law.                       See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.    50(a).         Concluding     that    the       plaintiffs      had    not    offered\n\nsufficient evidence to show either that \"bedbugs existed in the\n\nfurniture at the time it was delivered\" or that the defendant\n\n\"breached the relevant standard of care,\" the district court\n\ngranted the motion.           This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n               On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the district court\n\nabused   its     discretion        both    in    excluding        Gordinier's       opinion\n\ntestimony and in blocking the introduction of customer complaint\n\nevidence.        The    plaintiffs        add   that     because      of    these   errant\n\nrulings, the district court incorrectly took the case from the\n\njury.    We address these claims sequentially.\n\n                              A.    Expert Testimony.\n\n               The    trial   court's      exclusion         of   Gordinier's       opinion\n\ntestimony rested on its conclusion that the plaintiffs' failure\n\nduring discovery         to     produce    a    written       report   from     Gordinier\n\ntransgressed the commands of Rule 26(a)(2)(B).                              The district\n\ncourt's action amounts to preclusion as a sanction for a discovery\n\nviolation      and,     thus,      is   reviewed       for    abuse    of     discretion.\n\nMacaulay v. Anas, 321 F.3d 45, 51 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n               This is a familiar standard of review.                      A court abuses\n\nits    discretion       \"if   it    ignores       a    material     factor      deserving\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fsignificant weight, relies upon an improper factor, or assesses\n\nonly the proper mix of factors but makes a serious mistake in\n\nevaluating them.\"    Gomez v. Rivera Rodríguez, 344 F.3d 103, 112\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).    Embedded within this rubric is the principle\n\nthat a material error of law invariably constitutes an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d\n\n288, 292 (1st Cir. 2001).    It is against this backdrop that we\n\nexamine the challenged ruling.\n\n          We have explained that Rule 26 \"is an integral part of\n\nthe machinery devised to facilitate the management of pretrial\n\ndiscovery.\"   Gomez, 344 F.3d at 112.   Among other things, the rule\n\nprovides for wide-ranging pretrial disclosures in connection with\n\nanticipated expert testimony.    At its most basic level, the rule\n\nobligates a party who wishes to offer expert testimony to disclose\n\n\"the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present\n\nevidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705.\"     Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(A).     In the case at hand, the plaintiffs\n\nseasonably complied with this identification requirement, naming\n\nGordinier as a potential expert witness regarding causation.\n\n          Other, more stringent disclosure requirements pertain to\n\na witness who is \"retained or specially employed to provide expert\n\ntestimony in the case or . . . whose duties as the party's\n\nemployee regularly involve giving expert testimony.\" Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 26(a)(2)(B).     The proponent of a witness falling into this\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fsubset   must    submit    to   the    opposing    party    \"a   written       report\n\ncontaining,      inter     alia,      detailed     information         as     to    the\n\nqualifications and intended testimony of the witness.\" Gomez, 344\n\nF.3d at 113 (discussing Rule 26(a)(2)(B)).                  The district court\n\nheld that Gordinier came within this taxonomy and that, therefore,\n\nthe   plaintiffs    had    flouted     their     obligation      to    furnish      the\n\nrequired   information.         In    the   court's   view,      the   plaintiffs'\n\nfailure warranted the preclusion of Gordinier's opinion testimony.\n\nThe question, then, is whether Gordinier fit into this subset of\n\nexperts.\n\n           \"It     is    well   settled     that   'the    starting         point   for\n\ninterpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.'\"\n\nGwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc., 484\n\nU.S. 49, 56 (1987) (quoting Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n v. GTE\n\nSylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108 (1980)); see In re 229 Main St.\n\nLtd. P'ship, 262 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2001).                  The same starting\n\npoint obtains when a court is charged with interpreting a formal\n\nprocedural rule.        See, e.g., In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale\n\nPrice Litig., 588 F.3d 24, 39 (1st Cir. 2009); Duluth Lighthouse\n\nfor the Blind v. C.G. Bretting Mfg. Co., 199 F.R.D. 320, 325 (D.\n\nMinn. 2000).\n\n           As the text of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) makes plain, the rule\n\ncovers two types of experts: (i) \"retained or specially employed\"\n\nexperts who meet certain criteria and (ii) employees of a party\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fwho meet certain criteria.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B).   Because\n\nthere is no suggestion that Gordinier was regularly employed by\n\nthe plaintiffs, the lens of our inquiry narrows to whether he was\n\n\"retained or specially employed.\"\n\n          The circumstances suggest that he was not.        For one\n\nthing, there is no evidence that Gordinier was a person who held\n\nhimself out for hire as a purveyor of expert testimony.         For\n\nanother thing, there is no evidence that he was charging a fee for\n\nhis testimony.\n\n          In order to give the phrase \"retained or specially\n\nemployed\" any real meaning, a court must acknowledge the difference\n\nbetween a percipient witness who happens to be an expert and an\n\nexpert who without prior knowledge of the facts giving rise to\n\nlitigation is recruited to provide expert opinion testimony. It is\n\nthis difference, we think, that best informs the language of the\n\nrule.\n\n          This point is most aptly illustrated by the distinction\n\nthat courts have drawn between treating physicians and physicians\n\nrecruited for the purpose of giving expert opinion testimony.   The\n\nadvisory committee specifically uses this distinction to illustrate\n\nthe type of witness exempted from the written report requirement.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 advisory committee's note.      Courts have\n\nfollowed suit.   See, e.g., Gomez, 344 F.3d at 113.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f             This   analogy      is    persuasive    here.      Like    a   treating\n\nphysician — and unlike a prototypical expert witness — Gordinier\n\nwas not retained or specially employed for the purpose of offering\n\nexpert opinion testimony.          Rather, he was \"an actor with regard to\n\nthe occurrences from which the tapestry of the lawsuit was woven.\"\n\nId.   Put another way, his opinion testimony arises not from his\n\nenlistment     as   an    expert      but,    rather,   from   his     ground-level\n\ninvolvement in the events giving rise to the litigation.                    Thus, he\n\nfalls outside the compass of Rule 26(a)(2)(B).                 See Fielden v. CSX\n\nTransp., Inc., 482 F.3d 866, 869 (6th Cir. 2007).\n\n             In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\ndefendant contends that Gordinier should be considered \"retained\"\n\nbecause his inspection reports do not indicate that he deduced the\n\ncause of the infestation in the process of inspecting and treating\n\nthe plaintiffs' premises.             See, e.g., Meyers v. Nat'l R.R. Pass.\n\nCorp.,   619   F.3d      729,   734    (7th   Cir.   2010).      This   contention\n\nmisperceives both the law and the facts.\n\n             Interpreting the words \"retained or specially employed\"\n\nin a common-sense manner, consistent with their plain meaning, we\n\nconclude that as long as an expert was not retained or specially\n\nemployed in connection with the litigation, and his opinion about\n\ncausation is premised on personal knowledge and observations made\n\nin the course of treatment, no report is required under the terms\n\nof Rule 26(a)(2)(B).            See id. at 734-35; Garcia v. City of\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fSpringfield Police Dep't, 230 F.R.D. 247, 249 (D. Mass. 2005);\n\nSprague v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 177 F.R.D. 78, 81 (D.N.H. 1998).\n\nThis sensible interpretation is also consistent with the unique\n\nrole that an expert who is actually involved in the events giving\n\nrise to the litigation plays in the development of the factual\n\nunderpinnings of a case.   Finally, this interpretation recognizes\n\nthat the source, purpose, and timing of such an opinion differs\n\nmaterially from the architecture of an opinion given by an expert\n\nwho is \"retained or specially employed\" for litigation purposes.3\n\n          Consequently, where, as here, the expert is part of the\n\nongoing sequence of events and arrives at his causation opinion\n\nduring treatment, his opinion testimony is not that of a retained\n\nor specially employed expert.    See, e.g., In re Aredia & Zometa\n\nProds. Liab. Litig., ___ F. Supp. 2d ____, ____, No. 3:06-MD-1760,\n\n2010 WL 4970910, at *2 (M.D. Tenn. Dec. 7, 2010); Salas v. United\n\nStates, 165 F.R.D. 31, 33 (W.D.N.Y. 1995). If, however, the expert\n\ncomes to the case as a stranger and draws the opinion from facts\n\n\n     3\n        The defendant suggests that this rule encompasses a\nrequirement that the causation testimony must have been necessary\nto the treatment. Although a few district courts have held that a\nreport is required for causation testimony that was not necessary\nto the treatment, see, e.g., Starling v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 203\nF.R.D. 468, 479 (D. Kan. 2001), most courts do not draw such a\ndistinction, see, e.g., Garcia, 230 F.R.D. at 249; Sullivan v.\nGlock, Inc., 175 F.R.D. 497, 501 (D. Md. 1997); Hall v. Sykes, 164\nF.R.D. 46, 48-49 (E.D. Va. 1995). We accept this majority view and\nadhere to the distinction explicitly drawn by Rule 26 — a\ndistinction that is based on the role the witness has played in the\ncase. See Brandt Distrib. Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 247 F.3d 822, 825-\n26 (8th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                -12-\n\fsupplied by others, in preparation for trial, he reasonably can be\n\nviewed as retained or specially employed for that purpose, within\n\nthe purview of Rule 26(a)(2)(B).4       See Stanley Martin Cos. v.\n\nUniv'l Forest Prods. Shoffner LLC, 396 F. Supp. 2d 606, 619 n.8 (D.\n\nMd. 2005); Garcia, 230 F.R.D. at 249.\n\n          We pause to take stock.      While we acknowledge that the\n\ndifference between an opinion formulated by an on-the-scene expert\n\nduring treatment (e.g., by a treating physician) and one formulated\n\nby an expert hired in anticipation of testimony does not leap off\n\nthe page, a close reading of the text of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) convinces\n\nus that this is the precise distinction that the drafters of the\n\nrule had in mind.   We apply that distinction here.      We add, in\n\nfairness to the district court, that this distinction was blurred\n\nby the plaintiffs' initial designation of Gordinier as both a fact\n\nwitness and an expert.5   Nevertheless, after a careful examination\n\n\n     4\n       Although we have reviewed this claim of error in accordance\nwith the version of Rule 26(a) that was in effect at the time of\ntrial, a recent amendment to the rule, effective December 1, 2010,\nreinforces our interpretation.     In an effort to \"resolve[] a\ntension that has sometimes prompted courts to require reports under\nRule 26(a)(2)(B) even from witnesses exempted from the report\nrequirement,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 advisory committee's note, the\nrule was amended to emphasize that a Rule 26(a)(2)(B) \"report is\nrequired only from an expert described in (a)(2)(B).\"           Id.\n(emphasis supplied). Citing the example of a treating physician,\nthe advisory committee explained that a \"witness who is not\nrequired to provide a report under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) may both\ntestify as a fact witness and also provide expert testimony under\nEvidence Rule 702, 703, or 705.\" Id.\n     5\n       Conceivably, in some cases an on-the-scene expert whose\nviews are not subject to the written report requirement of Rule\n\n                                -13-\n\fof the record, we are satisfied that the distinction between the\n\ntwo types of experts was argued by the plaintiffs in the court\n\nbelow with sufficient clarity to preserve the claim of error.\n\nGiven that the claim of error has been preserved, what remains is\n\nto apply Rule 26(a)(2)(B) as we have parsed it to the case at hand.\n\n              Gordinier was called to the plaintiffs' home to inspect\n\nand   treat    the   infestation.       On   the    day    after     his   initial\n\ninspection, he prepared and transmitted a report to the defendant\n\nin hopes of convincing the defendant to accept responsibility and\n\ndefray the costs of extermination (treatment).                This sequence of\n\nevents leaves no doubt but that Gordinier formed his opinion about\n\ncausation (that is, about the defendant's responsibility for the\n\ninfestation)     based   on    his   personal     knowledge    and   information\n\ngleaned in the course of his initial inspection and related efforts\n\nto remediate the problem.        Accordingly, the report requirement of\n\nRule 26(a)(2)(B) did not pertain to Gordinier's causation opinion.\n\nSee Brandt Distrib. Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 247 F.3d 822, 825-27 (8th\n\nCir. 2001); Garcia, 230 F.R.D. at 249.                    The district court,\n\ntherefore,     abused    its   discretion    in    excluding    the    proffered\n\ntestimony on this ground.\n\n\n\n\n26(a)(2)(B) might also be retained or specially employed to develop\nadditional opinions for purposes of trial (and would, to that\nextent, trigger the written report requirement). We need not dwell\non this possibility, however, as the situation presented here does\nnot appear to cross that line.\n\n                                      -14-\n\f             There is one loose end.         The defendant suggests that the\n\ndistrict court's exclusion of this testimony was independently\n\nsupported by the district court's finding that Gordinier was\n\nunqualified to render the opinion.              See Daubert v. Merrell Dow\n\nPharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 588, 592-93 (1993); see also Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 702.    The record belies this suggestion: the district court\n\nmade   no    such    finding.       Withal,     the   issue    of   Gordinier's\n\nqualifications remains open on remand.\n\n                         B.     Customer Complaints.\n\n             The    plaintiffs    also   challenge    the     district   court's\n\nexclusion of a compendium of thirty-six customer complaints lodged\n\nwith the defendant between 2004 and 2006.             The plaintiffs aspired\n\nto offer this evidence to show that their alleged injury was\n\nreasonably foreseeable because others had advised the defendant of\n\ncomparable incidents.         The district court excluded this evidence\n\nbecause nothing in the record tended to show that the complaints\n\nwere substantially similar to the plaintiffs' complaint. We review\n\nrulings admitting or excluding evidence for abuse of discretion.\n\nColasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 100 F.3d 203, 212-13 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n             Federal evidentiary rules govern in diversity cases.\n\nFitzgerald v. Expwy. Sewerage Constr., Inc., 177 F.3d 71, 74 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).     If the federal rule is expansive enough to provide\n\nreliable guidance on a given issue, the court must apply it.               Id.;\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fDaigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 689 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nThe question presented here concerns the relevancy and unfairly\n\nprejudicial effect of the proffered evidence, and the Federal Rules\n\nof Evidence are sufficiently broad to encompass it.                 See Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 401-403.\n\n              This claim of error fails at the outset.            The plaintiffs\n\nnever marked for introduction, or otherwise placed in the record,\n\nthe list of complaints.         An appellant has the burden of ensuring\n\nthat the record is adequate to permit reasoned review of her\n\nclaims.      See Real v. Hogan, 828 F.2d 58, 60-61 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\nThe plaintiffs have defaulted on this obligation with respect to\n\nthe instant claim.\n\n              Even were we prepared to overlook this omission, the\n\nclaim is hopeless.        As best we can tell, the proffered evidence\n\nconsists of a computer-generated printout.              Each segment contains\n\na cryptic description of the nature of a particular complaint, a\n\ndescription of the type of furniture involved, and a notation of\n\nthe company's response.         There are no details of any sort.\n\n              The    printout   was   produced    by    the    defendant   during\n\npretrial discovery, and the plaintiffs conducted no investigation\n\ninto   the    underlying    facts     of   any   of    the    thirty-six   listed\n\ncomplaints.         On the bare bones of the printout, none of the\n\ncomplaints appears to be similar, and the plaintiffs made no effort\n\nto establish any substantial similarity between the incidents\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\funderlying the enumerated complaints and the incident giving rise\n\nto this action.    Indeed, on questioning by the district court the\n\nplaintiffs admitted that they could not even establish that any of\n\nthe enumerated complaints involved actual bedbug infestations.\n\n           Given this paucity of proof and the uncertainty as to\n\nwhat the printout means, it was well within the sweep of the\n\ndistrict court's discretion to exclude it.         See Heath v. Suzuki\n\nMotor Corp., 126 F.3d 1391, 1396 (11th Cir. 1997) (noting need for\n\nspecial   care    in   admitting   evidence   of   purportedly   similar\n\nincidents); McKinnon v. Skil Corp., 638 F.2d 270, 277 (1st Cir.\n\n1981) (explaining that \"[e]vidence of prior accidents is admissible\n\n. . . only if the proponent of the evidence shows that the\n\naccidents occurred under circumstances substantially similar to\n\nthose at issue in the case at bar\"); see also United States v.\n\nMaldonado-García, 446 F.3d 227, 232 (1st Cir. 2006) (noting that to\n\nbe relevant, evidence must make the existence or non-existence of\n\na material fact more likely) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 401).\n\n           The plaintiffs attempt to salvage this evidence by\n\narguing that its admission with a limiting instruction would have\n\nbeen appropriate.      This argument is jejune.\n\n           The first (rather large) fly in the ointment is that the\n\nplaintiffs never make clear what limiting instruction they think\n\nwould have been suitable and, in all events, they never requested\n\na limiting instruction below with respect to the computer-generated\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fprintout.        Their claim of error is, therefore, forfeited.             See\n\nUnited States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 409-10 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n              We need not probe the ramifications of this forfeiture\n\nbecause the argument puts the cart before the horse.                 Without a\n\nshowing     of     substantial    similarity,      the   evidence     was   not\n\nsignificantly probative, and evidence that is not significantly\n\nprobative may be excluded entirely. United States v. DeSimone, 488\n\nF.3d 561, 571 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\n\n1161, 1194 (1st Cir. 1993).        That is especially so where, as here,\n\nthe evidence has a high potential for unfair prejudice. See, e.g.,\n\nMcKinnon, 638 F.2d at 277; see also Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n                     C.    Judgment as a Matter of Law.\n\n              The plaintiffs' last assignment of error relates to the\n\ndistrict court's entry of judgment as a matter of law.               We review\n\nthe disposition of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de\n\nnovo.     Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).    A reviewing court, like a trial court confronted with such\n\na   motion,      \"must    scrutinize   the    evidence   and   the   inferences\n\nreasonably extractable therefrom in the light most hospitable to\n\nthe nonmovant.\" Martínez-Serrano v. Quality Health Servs. of P.R.,\n\nInc., 568 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir. 2009).           In conducting this assay,\n\n\"the court must not pass upon the credibility of the witnesses,\n\nresolve evidentiary conflicts, or engage in a comparative weighing\n\nof the proof.\"      Id. at 285.    Granting such a motion is appropriate\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fonly if the evidence, distilled in this fashion, dictates a result\n\nas to which reasonable minds cannot differ.            Veranda Beach Club\n\nLtd. P'ship v. W. Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1383-84 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n             Inasmuch   as    this     is   a   diversity    action,    state\n\nsubstantive law controls.      See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S.\n\n64, 78 (1938).    Here, the incident giving rise to the litigation\n\noccurred in Massachusetts and, thus, we look to Massachusetts law.\n\n             To recover on a claim of negligence in Massachusetts, a\n\nplaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nshe sustained an injury proximately caused by the defendant's\n\nbreach of a duty of care.       Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store,\n\nInc., 557 N.E.2d 1166, 1168 (Mass. 1990). The district court found\n\nthe proof deficient because the plaintiffs failed to show either\n\nproximate cause or breach of duty.          We examine both conclusions.\n\n             To make out causation, a plaintiff bears the burden of\n\nadducing sufficient evidence to undergird a finding of a causal\n\nconnection    between   her    alleged      injury   and    the   defendant's\n\nnegligence. Glicklich v. Spievack, 452 N.E.2d 287, 290 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 1983).     In this instance, the district court reached its\n\nconclusion about causation without the benefit of Gordinier's\n\nexcluded opinion testimony.          Had that testimony been admitted, a\n\nrational jury obviously could have drawn an inference of causation.\n\nAfter all, Gordinier would have opined that the likely source of\n\nthe bedbug infestation was the bedroom set purchased from and\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fdelivered by the defendant.      This opinion evidence, coupled with\n\nevidence that the defendant had no written policy regarding the\n\nprevention of bedbugs and that it used the same trucks for both\n\ndelivering    new   furniture   and   retrieving   used   furniture,   is\n\nsufficient to support a conclusion that the defendant delivered\n\nbedbugs along with the bedroom set.      See, e.g., Cook v. RI Dep't of\n\nMental Health, Retardation, and Hosps., 10 F.3d 17, 21, 26 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n             The evidence relating to the defendant's breach of duty\n\nwas also sufficient.     In most scenarios, the jury does not need\n\nexpert testimony to find that a defendant breached its duty of\n\ncare.   See Coyle v. Cliff Compton, Inc., 583 N.E.2d 875, 878 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1992).     Common sense and common experience will suffice.\n\n             To be sure, expert testimony is required in certain\n\ncircumstances in which a factfinder cannot reasonably be expected\n\nto make a judgment without the benefit of technical expertise or an\n\ninformed understanding of professional standards. See, e.g., Atlas\n\nTack Corp. v. Donabed, 712 N.E.2d 617, 621 (Mass. App. Ct. 1999);\n\nBrown v. Gerstein, 460 N.E.2d 1043, 1049 (Mass. App. Ct. 1984).\n\nBut that is the exception, not the rule — and the exception is\n\nnarrowly cabined.    The general rule is that \"[w]here a matter may\n\neasily be comprehended by jurors the testimony of an expert has no\n\nplace.\"   Coyle, 583 N.E.2d at 878 (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\f              Here, the plaintiffs' claim stems from the purchase and\n\ndelivery of new furniture.         This is not a highly technical or\n\nscientific field but, rather, a mundane occurrence that falls\n\nwithin the realm of common experience.             Consequently, no expert\n\ntestimony was necessary to establish the standard of care.                  See\n\nid.; Adams v. U.S. Steel Corp., 506 N.E.2d 893, 895 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1987).\n\n              The short of it is that the evidence of record, together\n\nwith Gordinier's opinion testimony, could lead a jury reasonably to\n\nconclude that the defendant violated its duty of care.             And in the\n\nsame vein, this evidence could plausibly permit the jury to find in\n\nfavor    of   the    plaintiffs   on    their    claims   for   violation    of\n\nMassachusetts consumer protection law and for breach of warranty.\n\nIannacchino v. Ford Motor Co., 888 N.E.2d 879, 889 (Mass. 2008).\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n              We need go no further.            For the reasons elucidated\n\nabove, we reverse the judgment below and remand for a new trial.\n\nCosts shall be taxed in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\f",

Because the expert in question was not an expert specially retained or employed for the purpose of testifying, we hold that the rule did not justify exclusion of the proffered testimony. Finding that error prejudicial, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In 2005, the plaintiffs, Yvette Downey and her daughter, Ashley Celester, were living in Randolph, Massachusetts. Early that year they began to experience skin irritation, which they originally attributed to allergies or infections. In the crepuscular hours of July 24, 2005, they awoke to discover an outbreak of insects. The parties agree in their briefs that some of the bugs were covering Ashley's body.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Yvette Downey immediately called Allegiance Pest Control and spoke to the service manager, Edward Gordinier, a licensed and experienced exterminator. Gordinier inspected the plaintiffs' home that day. His inspection revealed \"bedbugs harboring in the bed frame,\" which had been purchased from the defendant, Bob's Discount Furniture Holdings, Inc., as part of a children's bedroom set. The defendant delivered the set on December 29, 2004.</p>\n<p>Contemporaneous with the inspection, Gordinier prepared an incident report summarizing his findings. Pertinently, the report stated:</p>\n<blockquote>I inspected the entire apartment for insect activity. I found a moderate infestation of bed bugs throughout the house. The main source of activity is coming from [Ashley Celester's] room. It appears as though they have been carried to other areas of the house unknowingly. I recommend the entire house receive treatment immediately.</blockquote>\n<p>Yvette Downey promptly informed the defendant of the bedbug infestation. Moreover, on the day after his initial inspection, Gordinier sent a facsimile transmission to the defendant. The fax reported his findings and encouraged the defendant to defray the costs of extermination. Consistent with its return policy, the defendant retrieved and destroyed the allegedly offending furniture and refunded the purchase price. It did not agree to pay for the costs of extermination.</p>\n<p>At the plaintiffs' request, Gordinier subsequently carried out the needed extermination treatments. The plaintiffs allege that they experienced lasting health problems, emotional distress, and economic loss as a result of the entomological episode.</p>\n<p>Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1), the plaintiffs sued in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The operative pleadingtheir amended complaintasserted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> claims for negligence, breach of implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose and merchantability, and violations of a Massachusetts consumer protection law. The defendant denied fault.</p>\n<p>On June 4, 2007, the parties agreed to proceed before a magistrate judge. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 636(c); Fed.R.Civ.P. 73(a). The magistrate judge (whom we hereafter shall refer to as the district court) gave the parties until November 14, 2007 to designate experts. On the very day on which that deadline expired, the plaintiffs designated their exterminator, Gordinier, as an expert. This disclosure related that Gordinier would \"be used by [the plaintiffs] to give opinion testimony and otherwise present evidence under F.R.E. 702, 703 and/or 705.\"</p>\n<p>Although the plaintiffs named Gordinier (who, in all events, had previously been listed as a fact witness), they did not produce a written report delineating the details of Gordinier's anticipated testimony, nor did they specify his qualifications. Instead, they asserted that Gordinier had not been retained or specially employed as an expert (and that, therefore, no such supplemental disclosures were required).</p>\n<p>At subsequent pretrial conferences, the defendant maintained that the plaintiffs' disclosure was incomplete without a written report. The plaintiffs continued to demur.</p>\n<p>At a conference held on April 10, 2008, the plaintiffs represented that they would call Gordinier as an expert witness on the issue of causation. His opinion would be offered to show that the bedbugs probably had been delivered along with the purchased bedroom set. The plaintiffs' lawyer stated that Gordinier based this conclusion on his observation that the bedbugs were harboring in the bed frame and on his specialized knowledge that bedbugs were capable of living dormant and without feeding for many months.</p>\n<p>Forewarned by this representation, the defendant noticed Gordinier's deposition. It then canceled the scheduled deposition, explaining that neither Gordinier's findings nor his qualifications had been adequately disclosed.</p>\n<p>As trial approached, the case was reassigned to a different magistrate judge. The defendant subsequently filed two motions in limine. The first sought preclusion of Gordinier's opinion on causation. The second sought preclusion of evidence of thirty-six customer complaints that the defendant had received between 2004 and 2006.</p>\n<p>The district court heard arguments and granted both motions. The court grounded its preclusion of Gordinier's opinion testimony on the plaintiffs' failure to submit a written report as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B).<sup>[2]</sup> As to the second motion, the court found the customer complaint evidence not relevant and, in any event, more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p>Trial commenced on July 27, 2009. The plaintiffs called Gordinier as their first witness. After he had related details of his inspection of the premises, he was asked whether he had formed an opinion as to the source of the bedbug infestation. He replied in the affirmative. Upon the defendant's objection to admission of that opinion, the court reaffirmed its pretrial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> ruling and prohibited the plaintiffs from pursuing Gordinier's opinion testimony as to the cause of the infestation.</p>\n<p>In addition to fact testimony from Gordinier, the plaintiffs themselves testified and they introduced the deposition of the defendant's manager of delivery operations. This deposition testimony revealed that the defendant had no written policy anent the prevention of bedbug infestations. It also revealed that used bedding retrieved from customers' homes was routinely hauled in the same trucks and at the same times as new furniture to be delivered.</p>\n<p>At the close of the plaintiffs' case in chief, the defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). Concluding that the plaintiffs had not offered sufficient evidence to show either that \"bedbugs existed in the furniture at the time it was delivered\" or that the defendant \"breached the relevant standard of care,\" the district court granted the motion. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the district court abused its discretion both in excluding Gordinier's opinion testimony and in blocking the introduction of customer complaint evidence. The plaintiffs add that because of these errant rulings, the district court incorrectly took the case from the jury. We address these claims sequentially.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Expert Testimony.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The trial court's exclusion of Gordinier's opinion testimony rested on its conclusion that the plaintiffs' failure during discovery to produce a written report from Gordinier transgressed the commands of Rule 26(a)(2)(B). The district court's action amounts to preclusion as a sanction for a discovery violation and, thus, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>Macaulay v. Anas,</i> 321 F.3d 45, 51 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>This is a familiar standard of review. A court abuses its discretion \"if it ignores a material factor deserving significant weight, relies upon an improper factor, or assesses only the proper mix of factors but makes a serious mistake in evaluating them.\" <i>Gomez v. Rivera Rodríguez,</i> 344 F.3d 103, 112 (1st Cir.2003). Embedded within this rubric is the principle that a material error of law invariably constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico,</i> 247 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir.2001). It is against this backdrop that we examine the challenged ruling.</p>\n<p>We have explained that Rule 26 \"is an integral part of the machinery devised to facilitate the management of pretrial discovery.\" <i>Gomez,</i> 344 F.3d at 112. Among other things, the rule provides for wide-ranging pretrial disclosures in connection with anticipated expert testimony. At its most basic level, the rule obligates a party who wishes to offer expert testimony to disclose \"the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(A). In the case at hand, the plaintiffs seasonably complied with this identification requirement, naming Gordinier as a potential expert witness regarding causation.</p>\n<p>Other, more stringent disclosure requirements pertain to a witness who is \"retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or ... whose duties as the party's employee regularly involve giving expert testimony.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). The proponent of a witness falling into this subset must submit to the opposing party \"a written report containing, inter alia, detailed information as to the qualifications and intended testimony of the witness.\" <i>Gomez,</i> 344 F.3d at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> 113 (discussing Rule 26(a)(2)(B)). The district court held that Gordinier came within this taxonomy and that, therefore, the plaintiffs had flouted their obligation to furnish the required information. In the court's view, the plaintiffs' failure warranted the preclusion of Gordinier's opinion testimony. The question, then, is whether Gordinier fit into this subset of experts.</p>\n<p>\"It is well settled that `the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.'\" <i>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc.,</i> 484 U.S. 49, 56, 108 S.Ct. 376, 98 L.Ed.2d 306 (1987) (quoting <i>Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</i> 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980)); <i>see </i><i>In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship,</i> 262 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2001). The same starting point obtains when a court is charged with interpreting a formal procedural rule. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig.,</i> 588 F.3d 24, 39 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Duluth Lighthouse for the Blind v. C.G. Bretting Mfg. Co.,</i> 199 F.R.D. 320, 325 (D.Minn.2000).</p>\n<p>As the text of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) makes plain, the rule covers two types of experts: (i) \"retained or specially employed\" experts who meet certain criteria and (ii) employees of a party who meet certain criteria. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). Because there is no suggestion that Gordinier was regularly employed by the plaintiffs, the lens of our inquiry narrows to whether he was \"retained or specially employed.\"</p>\n<p>The circumstances suggest that he was not. For one thing, there is no evidence that Gordinier was a person who held himself out for hire as a purveyor of expert testimony. For another thing, there is no evidence that he was charging a fee for his testimony.</p>\n<p>In order to give the phrase \"retained or specially employed\" any real meaning, a court must acknowledge the difference between a percipient witness who happens to be an expert and an expert who without prior knowledge of the facts giving rise to litigation is recruited to provide expert opinion testimony. It is this difference, we think, that best informs the language of the rule.</p>\n<p>This point is most aptly illustrated by the distinction that courts have drawn between treating physicians and physicians recruited for the purpose of giving expert opinion testimony. The advisory committee specifically uses this distinction to illustrate the type of witness exempted from the written report requirement. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 26 advisory committee's note. Courts have followed suit. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gomez,</i> 344 F.3d at 113.</p>\n<p>This analogy is persuasive here. Like a treating physicianand unlike a prototypical expert witnessGordinier was not retained or specially employed for the purpose of offering expert opinion testimony. Rather, he was \"an actor with regard to the occurrences from which the tapestry of the lawsuit was woven.\" <i>Id.</i> Put another way, his opinion testimony arises not from his enlistment as an expert but, rather, from his ground-level involvement in the events giving rise to the litigation. Thus, he falls outside the compass of Rule 26(a)(2)(B). <i>See </i><i>Fielden v. CSX Transp., Inc.,</i> 482 F.3d 866, 869 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the defendant contends that Gordinier should be considered \"retained\" because his inspection reports do not indicate that he deduced the cause of the infestation in the process of inspecting and treating the plaintiffs' premises. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Meyers v. Nat'l R.R. Pass. Corp.,</i> 619 F.3d 729, 734 (7th Cir.2010). This contention misperceives both the law and the facts.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> Interpreting the words \"retained or specially employed\" in a common-sense manner, consistent with their plain meaning, we conclude that as long as an expert was not retained or specially employed in connection with the litigation, and his opinion about causation is premised on personal knowledge and observations made in the course of treatment, no report is required under the terms of Rule 26(a)(2)(B). <i>See id.</i> at 734-35; <i>Garcia v. City of Springfield Police Dep't,</i> 230 F.R.D. 247, 249 (D.Mass.2005); <i>Sprague v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 177 F.R.D. 78, 81 (D.N.H.1998). This sensible interpretation is also consistent with the unique role that an expert who is actually involved in the events giving rise to the litigation plays in the development of the factual underpinnings of a case. Finally, this interpretation recognizes that the source, purpose, and timing of such an opinion differs materially from the architecture of an opinion given by an expert who is \"retained or specially employed\" for litigation purposes.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Consequently, where, as here, the expert is part of the ongoing sequence of events and arrives at his causation opinion during treatment, his opinion testimony is not that of a retained or specially employed expert. <i>See, e.g., In re Aredia &amp; Zometa Prods. Liab. Litig.,</i> ___ F.Supp.2d ___, ___, No. 3:06-MD-1760, 2010 WL 4970910, at *2 (M.D.Tenn. Dec.7, 2010); <i>Salas v. United States,</i> 165 F.R.D. 31, 33 (W.D.N.Y.1995). If, however, the expert comes to the case as a stranger and draws the opinion from facts supplied by others, in preparation for trial, he reasonably can be viewed as retained or specially employed for that purpose, within the purview of Rule 26(a)(2)(B).<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>Stanley Martin Cos. v. Univ'l Forest Prods. Shoffner LLC,</i> 396 F.Supp.2d 606, 619 n. 8 (D.Md.2005); <i>Garcia,</i> 230 F.R.D. at 249.</p>\n<p>We pause to take stock. While we acknowledge that the difference between an opinion formulated by an on-the-scene expert during treatment (e.g., by a treating physician) and one formulated by an expert hired in anticipation of testimony does not leap off the page, a close reading of the text of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) convinces us that this is the precise distinction that the drafters of the rule had in mind. We apply that distinction here. We add, in fairness to the district court, that this distinction was blurred by the plaintiffs' initial designation of Gordinier as both a fact <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> witness and an expert.<sup>[5]</sup> Nevertheless, after a careful examination of the record, we are satisfied that the distinction between the two types of experts was argued by the plaintiffs in the court below with sufficient clarity to preserve the claim of error. Given that the claim of error has been preserved, what remains is to apply Rule 26(a)(2)(B) as we have parsed it to the case at hand.</p>\n<p>Gordinier was called to the plaintiffs' home to inspect and treat the infestation. On the day after his initial inspection, he prepared and transmitted a report to the defendant in hopes of convincing the defendant to accept responsibility and defray the costs of extermination (treatment). This sequence of events leaves no doubt but that Gordinier formed his opinion about causation (that is, about the defendant's responsibility for the infestation) based on his personal knowledge and information gleaned in the course of his initial inspection and related efforts to remediate the problem. Accordingly, the report requirement of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) did not pertain to Gordinier's causation opinion. <i>See </i><i>Brandt Distrib. Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co.,</i> 247 F.3d 822, 825-26 (8th Cir.2001); <i>Garcia,</i> 230 F.R.D. at 249. The district court, therefore, abused its discretion in excluding the proffered testimony on this ground.</p>\n<p>There is one loose end. The defendant suggests that the district court's exclusion of this testimony was independently supported by the district court's finding that Gordinier was unqualified to render the opinion. <i>See </i><i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 588, 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702. The record belies this suggestion: the district court made no such finding. Withal, the issue of Gordinier's qualifications remains open on remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Customer Complaints.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs also challenge the district court's exclusion of a compendium of thirty-six customer complaints lodged with the defendant between 2004 and 2006. The plaintiffs aspired to offer this evidence to show that their alleged injury was reasonably foreseeable because others had advised the defendant of comparable incidents. The district court excluded this evidence because nothing in the record tended to show that the complaints were substantially similar to the plaintiffs' complaint. We review rulings admitting or excluding evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> 100 F.3d 203, 212-13 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>Federal evidentiary rules govern in diversity cases. <i>Fitzgerald v. Expwy. Sewerage Constr., Inc.,</i> 177 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir.1999). If the federal rule is expansive enough to provide reliable guidance on a given issue, the court must apply it. <i>Id.; </i><i>Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc.,</i> 14 F.3d 684, 689 (1st Cir.1994). The question presented here concerns the relevancy and unfairly prejudicial effect of the proffered evidence, and the Federal Rules of Evidence are sufficiently broad to encompass it. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 401-403.</p>\n<p>This claim of error fails at the outset. The plaintiffs never marked for introduction, or otherwise placed in the record, the list of complaints. An appellant has the burden of ensuring that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> record is adequate to permit reasoned review of her claims. <i>See </i><i>Real v. Hogan,</i> 828 F.2d 58, 60-61 (1st Cir.1987). The plaintiffs have defaulted on this obligation with respect to the instant claim.</p>\n<p>Even were we prepared to overlook this omission, the claim is hopeless. As best we can tell, the proffered evidence consists of a computer-generated printout. Each segment contains a cryptic description of the nature of a particular complaint, a description of the type of furniture involved, and a notation of the company's response. There are no details of any sort.</p>\n<p>The printout was produced by the defendant during pretrial discovery, and the plaintiffs conducted no investigation into the underlying facts of any of the thirty-six listed complaints. On the bare bones of the printout, none of the complaints appears to be similar, and the plaintiffs made no effort to establish any substantial similarity between the incidents underlying the enumerated complaints and the incident giving rise to this action. Indeed, on questioning by the district court the plaintiffs admitted that they could not even establish that any of the enumerated complaints involved actual bedbug infestations.</p>\n<p>Given this paucity of proof and the uncertainty as to what the printout means, it was well within the sweep of the district court's discretion to exclude it. <i>See </i><i>Heath v. Suzuki Motor Corp.,</i> 126 F.3d 1391, 1396 (11th Cir.1997) (noting need for special care in admitting evidence of purportedly similar incidents); <i>McKinnon v. Skil Corp.,</i> 638 F.2d 270, 277 (1st Cir. 1981) (explaining that \"[e]vidence of prior accidents is admissible ... only if the proponent of the evidence shows that the accidents occurred under circumstances substantially similar to those at issue in the case at bar\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Maldonado-García,</i> 446 F.3d 227, 232 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that to be relevant, evidence must make the existence or nonexistence of a material fact more likely) (citing Fed.R.Evid. 401).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs attempt to salvage this evidence by arguing that its admission with a limiting instruction would have been appropriate. This argument is jejune.</p>\n<p>The first (rather large) fly in the ointment is that the plaintiffs never make clear <i>what</i> limiting instruction they think would have been suitable and, in all events, they never requested a limiting instruction below with respect to the computer-generated printout. Their claim of error is, therefore, forfeited. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 409-10 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>We need not probe the ramifications of this forfeiture because the argument puts the cart before the horse. Without a showing of substantial similarity, the evidence was not significantly probative, and evidence that is not significantly probative may be excluded entirely. <i>United States v. DeSimone,</i> 488 F.3d 561, 571 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1194 (1st Cir.1993). That is especially so where, as here, the evidence has a high potential for unfair prejudice. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McKinnon,</i> 638 F.2d at 277; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Judgment as a Matter of Law.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs' last assignment of error relates to the district court's entry of judgment as a matter of law. We review the disposition of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo. <i>Gibson v. City of Cranston,</i> 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.1994). A reviewing court, like a trial court confronted with such a motion, \"must scrutinize the evidence and the inferences reasonably extractable therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant.\" <i>Martínez-Serrano v. Quality Health</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> <i>Servs. of P.R., Inc.,</i> 568 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir.2009). In conducting this assay, \"the court must not pass upon the credibility of the witnesses, resolve evidentiary conflicts, or engage in a comparative weighing of the proof.\" <i>Id.</i> at 285. Granting such a motion is appropriate only if the evidence, distilled in this fashion, dictates a result as to which reasonable minds cannot differ. <i>Veranda Beach Club Ltd. P'ship v. W. Sur. Co.,</i> 936 F.2d 1364, 1383-84 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p>Inasmuch as this is a diversity action, state substantive law controls. <i>See </i><i>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Here, the incident giving rise to the litigation occurred in Massachusetts and, thus, we look to Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p>To recover on a claim of negligence in Massachusetts, a plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that she sustained an injury proximately caused by the defendant's breach of a duty of care. <i>Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.,</i> 408 Mass. 355, 557 N.E.2d 1166, 1168 (1990). The district court found the proof deficient because the plaintiffs failed to show either proximate cause or breach of duty. We examine both conclusions.</p>\n<p>To make out causation, a plaintiff bears the burden of adducing sufficient evidence to undergird a finding of a causal connection between her alleged injury and the defendant's negligence. <i>Glicklich v. Spievack,</i> 16 Mass.App.Ct. 488, 452 N.E.2d 287, 290 (1983). In this instance, the district court reached its conclusion about causation without the benefit of Gordinier's excluded opinion testimony. Had that testimony been admitted, a rational jury obviously could have drawn an inference of causation. After all, Gordinier would have opined that the likely source of the bedbug infestation was the bedroom set purchased from and delivered by the defendant. This opinion evidence, coupled with evidence that the defendant had no written policy regarding the prevention of bedbugs and that it used the same trucks for both delivering new furniture and retrieving used furniture, is sufficient to support a conclusion that the defendant delivered bedbugs along with the bedroom set. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cook v. RI Dep't of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hosps.,</i> 10 F.3d 17, 21, 26 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>The evidence relating to the defendant's breach of duty was also sufficient. In most scenarios, the jury does not need expert testimony to find that a defendant breached its duty of care. <i>See </i><i>Coyle v. Cliff Compton, Inc.,</i> 31 Mass.App.Ct. 744, 583 N.E.2d 875, 878 (1992). Common sense and common experience will suffice.</p>\n<p>To be sure, expert testimony is required in certain circumstances in which a factfinder cannot reasonably be expected to make a judgment without the benefit of technical expertise or an informed understanding of professional standards. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Atlas Tack Corp. v. Donabed,</i> 47 Mass.App.Ct. 221, 712 N.E.2d 617, 621 (1999); <i>Brown v. Gerstein,</i> 17 Mass.App. Ct. 558, 460 N.E.2d 1043, 1049 (1984). But that is the exception, not the ruleand the exception is narrowly cabined. The general rule is that \"[w]here a matter may easily be comprehended by jurors the testimony of an expert has no place.\" <i>Coyle,</i> 583 N.E.2d at 878 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the plaintiffs' claim stems from the purchase and delivery of new furniture. This is not a highly technical or scientific field but, rather, a mundane occurrence that falls within the realm of common experience. Consequently, no expert testimony was necessary to establish the standard of care. <i>See id.; </i><i>Adams v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> <i>U.S. Steel Corp.,</i> 24 Mass.App.Ct. 102, 506 N.E.2d 893, 895 (1987).</p>\n<p>The short of it is that the evidence of record, together with Gordinier's opinion testimony, could lead a jury reasonably to conclude that the defendant violated its duty of care. And in the same vein, this evidence could plausibly permit the jury to find in favor of the plaintiffs on their claims for violation of Massachusetts consumer protection law and for breach of warranty. <i>Iannacchino v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 451 Mass. 623, 888 N.E.2d 879, 889 (2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we reverse the judgment below and remand for a new trial. Costs shall be taxed in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed and remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Testimony in the record indicates that the bugs may actually have been swarming over the body of a visiting cousin. For present purposes, the difference is inconsequential, so we do not try to resolve it.</p>\n<p>[2]  Relatedly, the court ordered the plaintiffs to provide the defendant with a copy of Gordinier's curriculum vitae and an enumeration of all other cases in which he had testified. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). In response to this directive, the plaintiffs furnished a document stating that Gordinier had no curriculum vitae and had not previously testified. That ruling and response are not in issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p>[3]  The defendant suggests that this rule encompasses a requirement that the causation testimony must have been necessary to the treatment. Although a few district courts have held that a report is required for causation testimony that was not necessary to the treatment, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Starling v. Union Pac. R.R. Co.,</i> 203 F.R.D. 468, 479 (D.Kan.2001), most courts do not draw such a distinction, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Garcia,</i> 230 F.R.D. at 249; <i>Sullivan v. Glock, Inc.,</i> 175 F.R.D. 497, 501 (D.Md.1997); <i>Hall v. Sykes,</i> 164 F.R.D. 46, 48-49 (E.D.Va. 1995). We accept this majority view and adhere to the distinction explicitly drawn by Rule 26a distinction that is based on the role the witness has played in the case. <i>See </i><i>Brandt Distrib. Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co.,</i> 247 F.3d 822, 825-26 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>[4]  Although we have reviewed this claim of error in accordance with the version of Rule 26(a) that was in effect at the time of trial, a recent amendment to the rule, effective December 1, 2010, reinforces our interpretation. In an effort to \"resolve[] a tension that has sometimes prompted courts to require reports under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) even from witnesses exempted from the report requirement,\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 26 advisory committee's note, the rule was amended to emphasize that a Rule 26(a)(2)(B) \"report is required <i>only</i> from an expert described in (a)(2)(B).\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied). Citing the example of a treating physician, the advisory committee explained that a \"witness who is not required to provide a report under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) may both testify as a fact witness and also provide expert testimony under Evidence Rule 702, 703, or 705.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  Conceivably, in some cases an on-the-scene expert whose views are not subject to the written report requirement of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) might also be retained or specially employed to develop <i>additional</i> opinions for purposes of trial (and would, to that extent, trigger the written report requirement). We need not dwell on this possibility, however, as the situation presented here does not appear to cross that line.</p>\n\n</div>",

Finding that error prejudicial, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In 2005, the plaintiffs, Yvette Downey and her daughter, Ashley Celester, were living in Randolph, Massachusetts. Early that year they began to experience skin irritation, which they originally attributed to allergies or infections. In the crepuscular hours of July 24, 2005, they awoke to discover an outbreak of insects. The parties agree in their briefs that some of the bugs were covering Ashley's body.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Yvette Downey immediately called Allegiance Pest Control and spoke to the service manager, Edward Gordinier, a licensed and experienced exterminator. Gordinier inspected the plaintiffs' home that day. His inspection revealed \"bedbugs harboring in the bed frame,\" which had been purchased from the defendant, Bob's Discount Furniture Holdings, Inc., as part of a children's bedroom set. The defendant delivered the set on December 29, 2004.</p>\n<p>Contemporaneous with the inspection, Gordinier prepared an incident report summarizing his findings. Pertinently, the report stated:</p>\n<blockquote>I inspected the entire apartment for insect activity. I found a moderate infestation of bed bugs throughout the house. The main source of activity is coming from [Ashley Celester's] room. It appears as though they have been carried to other areas of the house unknowingly. I recommend the entire house receive treatment immediately.</blockquote>\n<p>Yvette Downey promptly informed the defendant of the bedbug infestation. Moreover, on the day after his initial inspection, Gordinier sent a facsimile transmission to the defendant. The fax reported his findings and encouraged the defendant to defray the costs of extermination. Consistent with its return policy, the defendant retrieved and destroyed the allegedly offending furniture and refunded the purchase price. It did not agree to pay for the costs of extermination.</p>\n<p>At the plaintiffs' request, Gordinier subsequently carried out the needed extermination treatments. The plaintiffs allege that they experienced lasting health problems, emotional distress, and economic loss as a result of the entomological episode.</p>\n<p>Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1), the plaintiffs sued in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The operative pleadingtheir amended complaintasserted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> claims for negligence, breach of implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose and merchantability, and violations of a Massachusetts consumer protection law. The defendant denied fault.</p>\n<p>On June 4, 2007, the parties agreed to proceed before a magistrate judge. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 636(c); Fed.R.Civ.P. 73(a). The magistrate judge (whom we hereafter shall refer to as the district court) gave the parties until November 14, 2007 to designate experts. On the very day on which that deadline expired, the plaintiffs designated their exterminator, Gordinier, as an expert. This disclosure related that Gordinier would \"be used by [the plaintiffs] to give opinion testimony and otherwise present evidence under F.R.E. 702, 703 and/or 705.\"</p>\n<p>Although the plaintiffs named Gordinier (who, in all events, had previously been listed as a fact witness), they did not produce a written report delineating the details of Gordinier's anticipated testimony, nor did they specify his qualifications. Instead, they asserted that Gordinier had not been retained or specially employed as an expert (and that, therefore, no such supplemental disclosures were required).</p>\n<p>At subsequent pretrial conferences, the defendant maintained that the plaintiffs' disclosure was incomplete without a written report. The plaintiffs continued to demur.</p>\n<p>At a conference held on April 10, 2008, the plaintiffs represented that they would call Gordinier as an expert witness on the issue of causation. His opinion would be offered to show that the bedbugs probably had been delivered along with the purchased bedroom set. The plaintiffs' lawyer stated that Gordinier based this conclusion on his observation that the bedbugs were harboring in the bed frame and on his specialized knowledge that bedbugs were capable of living dormant and without feeding for many months.</p>\n<p>Forewarned by this representation, the defendant noticed Gordinier's deposition. It then canceled the scheduled deposition, explaining that neither Gordinier's findings nor his qualifications had been adequately disclosed.</p>\n<p>As trial approached, the case was reassigned to a different magistrate judge. The defendant subsequently filed two motions in limine. The first sought preclusion of Gordinier's opinion on causation. The second sought preclusion of evidence of thirty-six customer complaints that the defendant had received between 2004 and 2006.</p>\n<p>The district court heard arguments and granted both motions. The court grounded its preclusion of Gordinier's opinion testimony on the plaintiffs' failure to submit a written report as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B).<sup>[2]</sup> As to the second motion, the court found the customer complaint evidence not relevant and, in any event, more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p>Trial commenced on July 27, 2009. The plaintiffs called Gordinier as their first witness. After he had related details of his inspection of the premises, he was asked whether he had formed an opinion as to the source of the bedbug infestation. He replied in the affirmative. Upon the defendant's objection to admission of that opinion, the court reaffirmed its pretrial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> ruling and prohibited the plaintiffs from pursuing Gordinier's opinion testimony as to the cause of the infestation.</p>\n<p>In addition to fact testimony from Gordinier, the plaintiffs themselves testified and they introduced the deposition of the defendant's manager of delivery operations. This deposition testimony revealed that the defendant had no written policy anent the prevention of bedbug infestations. It also revealed that used bedding retrieved from customers' homes was routinely hauled in the same trucks and at the same times as new furniture to be delivered.</p>\n<p>At the close of the plaintiffs' case in chief, the defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). Concluding that the plaintiffs had not offered sufficient evidence to show either that \"bedbugs existed in the furniture at the time it was delivered\" or that the defendant \"breached the relevant standard of care,\" the district court granted the motion. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the district court abused its discretion both in excluding Gordinier's opinion testimony and in blocking the introduction of customer complaint evidence. The plaintiffs add that because of these errant rulings, the district court incorrectly took the case from the jury. We address these claims sequentially.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Expert Testimony.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The trial court's exclusion of Gordinier's opinion testimony rested on its conclusion that the plaintiffs' failure during discovery to produce a written report from Gordinier transgressed the commands of Rule 26(a)(2)(B). The district court's action amounts to preclusion as a sanction for a discovery violation and, thus, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>Macaulay v. Anas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200359\"><a href=\"/opinion/200359/macaulay-v-anas/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>This is a familiar standard of review. A court abuses its discretion \"if it ignores a material factor deserving significant weight, relies upon an improper factor, or assesses only the proper mix of factors but makes a serious mistake in evaluating them.\" <i>Gomez v. Rivera Rodríguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200650\"><a href=\"/opinion/200650/gomez-candelaria-v-rivera-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 112 (1st Cir.2003). Embedded within this rubric is the principle that a material error of law invariably constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199377\"><a href=\"/opinion/199377/ramos-padro-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 292 (1st Cir.2001). It is against this backdrop that we examine the challenged ruling.</p>\n<p>We have explained that Rule 26 \"is an integral part of the machinery devised to facilitate the management of pretrial discovery.\" <i>Gomez,</i> 344 F.3d at 112. Among other things, the rule provides for wide-ranging pretrial disclosures in connection with anticipated expert testimony. At its most basic level, the rule obligates a party who wishes to offer expert testimony to disclose \"the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(A). In the case at hand, the plaintiffs seasonably complied with this identification requirement, naming Gordinier as a potential expert witness regarding causation.</p>\n<p>Other, more stringent disclosure requirements pertain to a witness who is \"retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or ... whose duties as the party's employee regularly involve giving expert testimony.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). The proponent of a witness falling into this subset must submit to the opposing party \"a written report containing, inter alia, detailed information as to the qualifications and intended testimony of the witness.\" <i>Gomez,</i> 344 F.3d at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> 113 (discussing Rule 26(a)(2)(B)). The district court held that Gordinier came within this taxonomy and that, therefore, the plaintiffs had flouted their obligation to furnish the required information. In the court's view, the plaintiffs' failure warranted the preclusion of Gordinier's opinion testimony. The question, then, is whether Gordinier fit into this subset of experts.</p>\n<p>\"It is well settled that `the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.'\" <i>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v.

The same starting point obtains when a court is charged with interpreting a formal procedural rule. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Duluth Lighthouse for the Blind v.

Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). Because there is no suggestion that Gordinier was regularly employed by the plaintiffs, the lens of our inquiry narrows to whether he was \"retained or specially employed.\"</p>\n<p>The circumstances suggest that he was not. For one thing, there is no evidence that Gordinier was a person who held himself out for hire as a purveyor of expert testimony. For another thing, there is no evidence that he was charging a fee for his testimony.</p>\n<p>In order to give the phrase \"retained or specially employed\" any real meaning, a court must acknowledge the difference between a percipient witness who happens to be an expert and an expert who without prior knowledge of the facts giving rise to litigation is recruited to provide expert opinion testimony. It is this difference, we think, that best informs the language of the rule.</p>\n<p>This point is most aptly illustrated by the distinction that courts have drawn between treating physicians and physicians recruited for the purpose of giving expert opinion testimony. The advisory committee specifically uses this distinction to illustrate the type of witness exempted from the written report requirement. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 26 advisory committee's note. Courts have followed suit. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gomez,</i> 344 F.3d at 113.</p>\n<p>This analogy is persuasive here. Like a treating physicianand unlike a prototypical expert witnessGordinier was not retained or specially employed for the purpose of offering expert opinion testimony. Rather, he was \"an actor with regard to the occurrences from which the tapestry of the lawsuit was woven.\" <i>Id.</i> Put another way, his opinion testimony arises not from his enlistment as an expert but, rather, from his ground-level involvement in the events giving rise to the litigation. Thus, he falls outside the compass of Rule 26(a)(2)(B). <i>See </i><i>Fielden v. CSX Transp., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797391\"><a href=\"/opinion/797391/jesse-a-fielden-v-csx-transportation-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span>, 869 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the defendant contends that Gordinier should be considered \"retained\" because his inspection reports do not indicate that he deduced the cause of the infestation in the process of inspecting and treating the plaintiffs' premises. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Meyers v. Nat'l R.R. Pass. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"174312\"><a href=\"/opinion/174312/meyers-v-national-rr-passenger-corpamtrak/\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span>, 734 (7th Cir.2010). This contention misperceives both the law and the facts.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> Interpreting the words \"retained or specially employed\" in a common-sense manner, consistent with their plain meaning, we conclude that as long as an expert was not retained or specially employed in connection with the litigation, and his opinion about causation is premised on personal knowledge and observations made in the course of treatment, no report is required under the terms of Rule 26(a)(2)(B). <i>See id.</i> at 734-35; <i>Garcia v. City of Springfield Police Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></span>, 249 (D.Mass.2005); <i>Sprague v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></span>, 81 (D.N.H.1998). This sensible interpretation is also consistent with the unique role that an expert who is actually involved in the events giving rise to the litigation plays in the development of the factual underpinnings of a case. Finally, this interpretation recognizes that the source, purpose, and timing of such an opinion differs materially from the architecture of an opinion given by an expert who is \"retained or specially employed\" for litigation purposes.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Consequently, where, as here, the expert is part of the ongoing sequence of events and arrives at his causation opinion during treatment, his opinion testimony is not that of a retained or specially employed expert. <i>See, e.g., In re Aredia &amp; Zometa Prods. Liab. Litig.,</i> ___ F.Supp.2d ___, ___, No. 3:06-MD-1760, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4970910</span></span>, at *2 (M.D.Tenn.

If, however, the expert comes to the case as a stranger and draws the opinion from facts supplied by others, in preparation for trial, he reasonably can be viewed as retained or specially employed for that purpose, within the purview of Rule 26(a)(2)(B).<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>Stanley Martin Cos. v. Univ'l Forest Prods. Shoffner LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567101\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567101/stanley-martin-companies-v-universal-forest-products-shoffner/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span>, 619 n. 8 (D.Md.2005); <i>Garcia,</i> 230 F.R.D. at 249.</p>\n<p>We pause to take stock. While we acknowledge that the difference between an opinion formulated by an on-the-scene expert during treatment (e.g., by a treating physician) and one formulated by an expert hired in anticipation of testimony does not leap off the page, a close reading of the text of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) convinces us that this is the precise distinction that the drafters of the rule had in mind. We apply that distinction here. We add, in fairness to the district court, that this distinction was blurred by the plaintiffs' initial designation of Gordinier as both a fact <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> witness and an expert.<sup>[5]</sup> Nevertheless, after a careful examination of the record, we are satisfied that the distinction between the two types of experts was argued by the plaintiffs in the court below with sufficient clarity to preserve the claim of error. Given that the claim of error has been preserved, what remains is to apply Rule 26(a)(2)(B) as we have parsed it to the case at hand.</p>\n<p>Gordinier was called to the plaintiffs' home to inspect and treat the infestation. On the day after his initial inspection, he prepared and transmitted a report to the defendant in hopes of convincing the defendant to accept responsibility and defray the costs of extermination (treatment). This sequence of events leaves no doubt but that Gordinier formed his opinion about causation (that is, about the defendant's responsibility for the infestation) based on his personal knowledge and information gleaned in the course of his initial inspection and related efforts to remediate the problem. Accordingly, the report requirement of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) did not pertain to Gordinier's causation opinion. <i>See </i><i>Brandt Distrib. Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772963\"><a href=\"/opinion/772963/brandt-distributing-co-inc-a-missouri-corporation-v-federal-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>, 825-26 (8th Cir.2001); <i>Garcia,</i> 230 F.R.D. at 249. The district court, therefore, abused its discretion in excluding the proffered testimony on this ground.</p>\n<p>There is one loose end. The defendant suggests that the district court's exclusion of this testimony was independently supported by the district court's finding that Gordinier was unqualified to render the opinion. <i>See </i><i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 588, 592-93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span> (1993); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702. The record belies this suggestion: the district court made no such finding. Withal, the issue of Gordinier's qualifications remains open on remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Customer Complaints.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs also challenge the district court's exclusion of a compendium of thirty-six customer complaints lodged with the defendant between 2004 and 2006. The plaintiffs aspired to offer this evidence to show that their alleged injury was reasonably foreseeable because others had advised the defendant of comparable incidents. The district court excluded this evidence because nothing in the record tended to show that the complaints were substantially similar to the plaintiffs' complaint. We review rulings admitting or excluding evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197080\"><a href=\"/opinion/197080/colasanto-v-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 212-13 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>Federal evidentiary rules govern in diversity cases. <i>Fitzgerald v.

If the federal rule is expansive enough to provide reliable guidance on a given issue, the court must apply it. <i>Id.; </i><i>Daigle v. Me. Med.

The question presented here concerns the relevancy and unfairly prejudicial effect of the proffered evidence, and the Federal Rules of Evidence are sufficiently broad to encompass it. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 401-403.</p>\n<p>This claim of error fails at the outset. The plaintiffs never marked for introduction, or otherwise placed in the record, the list of complaints. An appellant has the burden of ensuring that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> record is adequate to permit reasoned review of her claims. <i>See </i><i>Real v. Hogan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493886\"><a href=\"/opinion/493886/john-real-v-william-t-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 60-61 (1st Cir.1987). The plaintiffs have defaulted on this obligation with respect to the instant claim.</p>\n<p>Even were we prepared to overlook this omission, the claim is hopeless. As best we can tell, the proffered evidence consists of a computer-generated printout. Each segment contains a cryptic description of the nature of a particular complaint, a description of the type of furniture involved, and a notation of the company's response. There are no details of any sort.</p>\n<p>The printout was produced by the defendant during pretrial discovery, and the plaintiffs conducted no investigation into the underlying facts of any of the thirty-six listed complaints. On the bare bones of the printout, none of the complaints appears to be similar, and the plaintiffs made no effort to establish any substantial similarity between the incidents underlying the enumerated complaints and the incident giving rise to this action. Indeed, on questioning by the district court the plaintiffs admitted that they could not even establish that any of the enumerated complaints involved actual bedbug infestations.</p>\n<p>Given this paucity of proof and the uncertainty as to what the printout means, it was well within the sweep of the district court's discretion to exclude it. <i>See </i><i>Heath v. Suzuki Motor Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72403\"><a href=\"/opinion/72403/heath-v-suzuki-motor-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1391</span></a></span>, 1396 (11th Cir.1997) (noting need for special care in admitting evidence of purportedly similar incidents); <i>McKinnon v.

This argument is jejune.</p>\n<p>The first (rather large) fly in the ointment is that the plaintiffs never make clear <i>what</i> limiting instruction they think would have been suitable and, in all events, they never requested a limiting instruction below with respect to the computer-generated printout. Their claim of error is, therefore, forfeited. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Without a showing of substantial similarity, the evidence was not significantly probative, and evidence that is not significantly probative may be excluded entirely. <i>United States v.

We examine both conclusions.</p>\n<p>To make out causation, a plaintiff bears the burden of adducing sufficient evidence to undergird a finding of a causal connection between her alleged injury and the defendant's negligence. <i>Glicklich v. Spievack,</i> 16 Mass.App.Ct. 488, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2064130\"><a href=\"/opinion/2064130/glicklich-v-spievack/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span>, 290 (1983). In this instance, the district court reached its conclusion about causation without the benefit of Gordinier's excluded opinion testimony. Had that testimony been admitted, a rational jury obviously could have drawn an inference of causation. After all, Gordinier would have opined that the likely source of the bedbug infestation was the bedroom set purchased from and delivered by the defendant. This opinion evidence, coupled with evidence that the defendant had no written policy regarding the prevention of bedbugs and that it used the same trucks for both delivering new furniture and retrieving used furniture, is sufficient to support a conclusion that the defendant delivered bedbugs along with the bedroom set. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cook v. RI Dep't of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hosps.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195048\"><a href=\"/opinion/195048/cook-v-state-of-ri/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21, 26 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>The evidence relating to the defendant's breach of duty was also sufficient. In most scenarios, the jury does not need expert testimony to find that a defendant breached its duty of care. <i>See </i><i>Coyle v. Cliff Compton, Inc.,</i> 31 Mass.App.Ct. 744, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></span>, 878 (1992). Common sense and common experience will suffice.</p>\n<p>To be sure, expert testimony is required in certain circumstances in which a factfinder cannot reasonably be expected to make a judgment without the benefit of technical expertise or an informed understanding of professional standards. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Atlas Tack Corp. v. Donabed,</i> 47 Mass.App.Ct. 221, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></span>, 621 (1999); <i>Brown v. Gerstein,</i> 17 Mass.App. Ct. 558, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2013242\"><a href=\"/opinion/2013242/brown-v-gerstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1043</span></a></span>, 1049 (1984). But that is the exception, not the ruleand the exception is narrowly cabined. The general rule is that \"[w]here a matter may easily be comprehended by jurors the testimony of an expert has no place.\" <i>Coyle,</i> 583 N.E.2d at 878 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the plaintiffs' claim stems from the purchase and delivery of new furniture. This is not a highly technical or scientific field but, rather, a mundane occurrence that falls within the realm of common experience. Consequently, no expert testimony was necessary to establish the standard of care. <i>See id.; </i><i>Adams v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> <i>U.S. Steel Corp.,</i> 24 Mass.App.Ct. 102, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2210057\"><a href=\"/opinion/2210057/adams-v-united-states-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span>, 895 (1987).</p>\n<p>The short of it is that the evidence of record, together with Gordinier's opinion testimony, could lead a jury reasonably to conclude that the defendant violated its duty of care. And in the same vein, this evidence could plausibly permit the jury to find in favor of the plaintiffs on their claims for violation of Massachusetts consumer protection law and for breach of warranty. <i>Iannacchino v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">879</span></span>, 889 (2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we reverse the judgment below and remand for a new trial. Costs shall be taxed in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed and remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Testimony in the record indicates that the bugs may actually have been swarming over the body of a visiting cousin. For present purposes, the difference is inconsequential, so we do not try to resolve it.</p>\n<p>[2]  Relatedly, the court ordered the plaintiffs to provide the defendant with a copy of Gordinier's curriculum vitae and an enumeration of all other cases in which he had testified. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). In response to this directive, the plaintiffs furnished a document stating that Gordinier had no curriculum vitae and had not previously testified. That ruling and response are not in issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p>[3]  The defendant suggests that this rule encompasses a requirement that the causation testimony must have been necessary to the treatment. Although a few district courts have held that a report is required for causation testimony that was not necessary to the treatment, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Starling v. Union Pac. R.R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></span>, 479 (D.Kan.2001), most courts do not draw such a distinction, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Garcia,</i> 230 F.R.D. at 249; <i>Sullivan v. Glock, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></span>, 501 (D.Md.1997); <i>Hall v. Sykes,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></span>, 48-49 (E.D.Va. 1995). We accept this majority view and adhere to the distinction explicitly drawn by Rule 26a distinction that is based on the role the witness has played in the case. <i>See </i><i>Brandt Distrib. Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772963\"><a href=\"/opinion/772963/brandt-distributing-co-inc-a-missouri-corporation-v-federal-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>, 825-26 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>[4]  Although we have reviewed this claim of error in accordance with the version of Rule 26(a) that was in effect at the time of trial, a recent amendment to the rule, effective December 1, 2010, reinforces our interpretation. In an effort to \"resolve[] a tension that has sometimes prompted courts to require reports under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) even from witnesses exempted from the report requirement,\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 26 advisory committee's note, the rule was amended to emphasize that a Rule 26(a)(2)(B) \"report is required <i>only</i> from an expert described in (a)(2)(B).\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied). Citing the example of a treating physician, the advisory committee explained that a \"witness who is not required to provide a report under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) may both testify as a fact witness and also provide expert testimony under Evidence Rule 702, 703, or 705.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  Conceivably, in some cases an on-the-scene expert whose views are not subject to the written report requirement of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) might also be retained or specially employed to develop <i>additional</i> opinions for purposes of trial (and would, to that extent, trigger the written report requirement). We need not dwell on this possibility, however, as the situation presented here does not appear to cross that line.</p>\n\n</div>",
