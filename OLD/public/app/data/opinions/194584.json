McFarland,  Supervising Counsel, Department  of Correction,\n                \non Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Disposition, for\nappellees.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per  Curiam.   Appellant,  William  M.  Tyree, Jr.,\n                     \n\ncurrently  is imprisoned in  the Cedar Junction Massachusetts\n\nCorrectional  Institute; he  is serving  a life  sentence for\n\nfirst-degree  murder.   On December  27, 1988,  appellant was\n\ntransferred   from   Cedar   Junction  to   the   Old  Colony\n\nCorrectional Center  where he spent twenty-seven  days in the\n\nadministrative  segregation  unit.    On  February  8,  1989,\n\nappellant filed five separate complaints in the Massachusetts\n\ndistrict court concerning his  prison status and his transfer\n\nto and residence at Old Colony.  The district court dismissed\n\nall  five  actions   for  lack  of  prosecution.     A  brief\n\ndescription of each action follows.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          1.  Appellant alleges  that when he was transferred\n\nto Old Colony, prison  officials refused to allow him  to use\n\nhis television  set with speakers; instead,  he was required,\n\nunder  regulations apparently  promulgated  in 1983,  to  use\n\nearplugs or headphones.   He claims that this  rule was an ex\n                                                             \n\npost  facto  violation  of  the  United  States  Constitution\n           \n\nbecause  appellant had been  allowed the use  of a television\n\nset with speakers since the beginning of his incarceration in\n\n1979.    He  also  maintained  that  his  civil  rights  were\n\ninfringed on the  ground that the regulation  did not contain\n\nan exception  that allowed hearing-impaired  prisoners to use\n\ntelevision  sets   with  speakers.    In   this  action,  the\n\n                             -2-\n\ndefendants were served with process.  They filed their answer\n\nin May 1989.\n\n          2.  Because appellant had enemies at Old Colony and\n\nbecause Old Colony lacked  a protection unit, appellant avers\n\nthat he  was forced  into administrative segregation  for the\n\ntwenty-seven  days he spent at Old Colony.  During this time,\n\nappellant  claims that  he  was denied  proper medical  care.\n\nSpecifically, prison  officials  allegedly refused  to  allow\n\nappellant to bring  with him  two knee braces  he needed  for\n\nsupport.    He  further  alleged  that  he  did  not  receive\n\nsufficient  daily  exercise and  did  not  have  access to  a\n\n\"universal\" weight machine.  In addition to these complaints,\n\nappellant states that the  prison officials refused to ensure\n\nthat all  of his mail was  being sent out, that  the transfer\n\nmade it difficult for him to receive visitors and that, after\n\n\"punching out\" two glass windows, appellant was placed in the\n\n\"nut  room\"  and threatened  with  the  possibility of  being\n\nchained  to the bed.   None of  the defendants named  in this\n\naction were served with process.\n\n          3.  Appellant states  that while in the segregation\n\nunit  he did  not have  access, as did  the prisoners  in the\n\ngeneral  population, to  a footlocker in  which to  store his\n\npersonal belongings.   He also claims that  defendants used a\n\ntwo-way window  and an electronic eavesdropping  sound gun to\n\nmonitor  all of appellant's visits with outsiders.  As in the\n\n                             -3-\n\npreviously   described  action,  appellant  failed  to  serve\n\ndefendants with his complaint.\n\n          4.  In the fourth complaint, appellant alleges that\n\nin 1985 he was transferred to a higher security prison as the\n\nresult  of   allegations  he  had  made  concerning  employee\n\ndiscrimination in  the Massachusetts  prison system.   Due to\n\nhis  involvement in  this matter,  appellant asserts  that he\n\nbecame known  as  a legal  and  political troublemaker.    He\n\ncharges that he made defendants aware of the fact that due to\n\nthe  above allegations,  he had  enemies at  Old Colony.   He\n\nagain asserts that  he needed to be placed  in administrative\n\nsegregation at Old  Colony --  the only place  where he  felt\n\nsafe.  All of the defendants were served with process in this\n\naction and they filed answers in May 1989.\n\n          5.      Appellant  claims   that  under   a  prison\n\nregulation,  an inmate  who refuses  to transfer  to  a lower\n\nsecurity prison  loses work  privileges, is not  permitted to\n\nattend  vocational,  educational   and  other   institutional\n\nprograms, and is  not allowed  to attend  church.   Appellant\n\nasserts  that he lost the above privileges due to his refusal\n\nto transfer to  a medium  security prison.   In this  action,\n\nappellant served the defendants and in 1990 sent requests for\n\nadmissions to them.\n\n                             -4-\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          On  March  11,  1992,  the  district  court  issued\n\nnotices  in all  five actions  pursuant to  Local Rule  41.1.\n\nThis rule provides:\n\n               (a)(1)  Whenever in any civil action\n          the   clerk   shall  ascertain   that  no\n          proceeding has been docketed  therein for\n          a period  of ONE (1) year,  he shall then\n          mail  notice  to  all  persons  who  have\n          entered  an  appearance  in such  a  case\n          that,  subject  to   the  provisions   of\n          subsection  (a)(3),  the  case   will  be\n          dismissed  without further  notice thirty\n          (30)  days  after  the  sending   of  the\n          notice.\n\nIn  response to  this notice,  appellant requested  an eight-\n\nmonth  extension of  time.   He  based  this request  on  his\n\nassertions  that since the filing of the five actions in 1989\n\nthe  Department   of   Corrections  (DOC)   had   confiscated\n\nappellant's legal  papers and had  failed to  return them  to\n\nappellant, had opened appellant's  legal mail, had denied him\n\naccess to the law library during \"lock downs\" and had made it\n\ndifficult for him to obtain typewriting materials.\n\n          The  district court  denied appellant's  motion and\n\ndismissed the  five  actions.   The  court accepted  as  true\n\nappellant's  allegation   that  his  legal  files   had  been\n\nconfiscated.    It  nonetheless   found  that  this  did  not\n\n\"satisfactorily explain\" appellant's inaction and his failure\n\nto communicate with the district court.\n\n                             -5-\n\n                             III.\n                                \n\n          A district  court's sua sponte power  to dismiss an\n                                        \n\naction  for  want of  prosecution  is  \"'an inherent  power,'\n\ngoverned  not   by  rule  or  statute  but   by  the  control\n\nnecessarily vested in the courts  to manage their own affairs\n\nso  as to achieve the orderly  and expeditious disposition of\n\ncases.\"    Link v.  Wabash R.R.  Co.,  370 U.S.  626, 630-631\n                                    \n\n(1962)  (footnote omitted).   \"[T]his  power is  necessary to\n\nprevent  undue delays  in the  disposition of  pending cases,\n\ndocket  congestion, and  the possibility  of harassment  of a\n\ndefendant.\"   Zavala  Santiago v.

However,  such dismissals  are\n\n\"drastic sanctions,  which should  be employed only  when the\n\ndistrict court,  in the  careful exercise of  its discretion,\n\ndetermines that none of the lesser sanctions available  to it\n\nwould truly be appropriate.\"  Id.

Senior  Indust., Inc., 848  F.2d 315,\n                                             \n\n317  (1st Cir.  1988).   In conducting  this review,  we must\n\nexamine all relevant circumstances.   Asociacion de Empleados\n                                                             \n\ndel Instituto de Cultura Puertorriquena v. Rodriguez Morales,\n                                                            \n\n538  F.2d 915, 916 n.2 (1st  Cir. 1976).  Among the pertinent\n\nfactors we  consider are the  history of the  litigation, the\n\nlength and  type  of  delay, the  nature  of  the  underlying\n\n                             -6-\n\nclaims, the possible prejudice to defendants and the presence\n\nof  an  adequate excuse  for  a  plaintiff's  inaction.   See\n                                                             \n\nCarribbean Transp.  Sys., Inc. v. Autoridad  de las Navieras,\n                                                            \n\n901 F.2d 196, 197 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n          Turning  to the case at hand, we first note that in\n\ntwo  of the actions, appellant never  made service of process\n\non  the defendants named in  the complaints.   This in itself\n\nsuffices for a finding of  lack of prosecution.  See id.   In\n                                                        \n\ntwo out of the three actions in which  service of process was\n\naccomplished, appellant took no steps to further the progress\n\nof the  actions after the answers were filed in 1989.  In the\n\none  action  where the  proceedings  did  advance beyond  the\n\nfiling of  the defendants'  answers, appellant  sent requests\n\nfor admissions  to the DOC in  July 1990.  Thus,  by the time\n\nthe  Local Rule 41.1 notice was sent in March 1992, appellant\n\nhad done nothing  in four of the cases for almost three years\n\nand in the fifth case for well over one year.\n\n          A clear  record of delay \"measured in years,\" as in\n\nthe  case at  hand,  will support  a  dismissal for  want  of\n\nprosecution.  See Cosme Nieves v. Deshler, 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir.  1987).    Appellant  asserts  on  appeal  that  he  did\n\n\"everything possible\" to alert the DOC and the district court\n\nto the problem of the missing legal files and interference by\n\nprison  officials   with  his  personal   papers  and   mail.\n\nSpecifically,  he states that he  filed a protective order in\n\n                             -7-\n\nthe  district  court  in  1990.   To  support  his  position,\n\nappellant refers to the first addendum to his brief.  While a\n\nreview of the material included in addendum #1 indicates that\n\nappellant  pursued his  complaints within the  prison system,\n\nthere is  no evidence  that appellant contacted  the district\n\ncourt in any  way to alert it to his  difficulties.  The only\n\nreference  to  a protective  order  is  in papers  concerning\n\nanother action filed by appellant in the district court.\n\n          We  find appellant's  excuse inadequate  to explain\n\nsuch long delays  in the  prosecution of these  actions.   In\n\nlight of  appellant's knowledge  in 1989 that  he would  have\n\ndifficulty  in  pursuing  his complaints  due  to defendants'\n\nalleged obstructive  conduct, he was in a  position to appeal\n\nto the district  court for  relief.  See  Medeiros v.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 621  F.2d 468, 470  (1st Cir. 1980)  (where plaintiff\n      \n\nknew about unavailability of expert witness for approximately\n\nfive months prior to trial date and  was, as a result, unable\n\nto  proceed on  day  of trial,  dismissal warranted);  Zavala\n                                                             \n\nSantiago, 553 F.2d at 713 (initial burden to go forward is on\n        \n\nplaintiff  and failure to alert district court to problems is\n\none factor  supporting dismissal  for failure  to prosecute).\n\nThis  is not a case  where, although a  significant amount of\n\ntime had passed between  the filing of the complaint  and the\n\ndismissal  for want  of  prosecution, the  parties diligently\n\nacted to advance  the case.   See Richman  v. General  Motors\n                                                             \n\n                             -8-\n\nCorp.,  437  F.2d 196,  199  (1st Cir.  1971)  (where parties\n     \n\nactively  pursued  action,  outright  dismissal  too harsh  a\n\nsanction).  Rather, appellant essentially did nothing.\n\n          In light of his ability, as the district noted  and\n\nappellant himself acknowledges, to  pursue his other  federal\n\nactions, his inertia in these cases becomes less supportable.\n\nAlthough appellant's conduct  cannot be called  contumacious,\n\nit is plain that he has unreasonably delayed in advancing his\n\ncauses  of action and in  applying to the  district court for\n\nrelief.  Indeed, his request for  an eight-month extension of\n\ntime in response  to the notice of dismissal  only highlights\n\nthe  likelihood that  appellant  will continue  to  act in  a\n\ndilatory manner.  In  such a situation, dismissal is  not too\n\nharsh a sanction.  See Medeiros, 621 F.2d at 470-71 (delay by\n                               \n\nplaintiff  in  availing himself  of  discovery,  although not\n\n\"contumacious,\" is  a sufficient  ground for dismissal).   We\n\nalso note  that the  merits of appellant's  underlying claims\n\nare questionable  and that the  long pendency of  this action\n\nhas likely resulted  on prejudice  to defendants.   Thus,  we\n\ncannot say that  the district court abused its  discretion in\n\ndismissing the  complaints under  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  41(b) and\n\nLocal Rule 41.1.\n\n          The judgments of the district court are affirmed.\n                                                          \n\n                             -9-\n",

The district court dismissed\n\nall  five  actions   for  lack  of  prosecution.     A  brief\n\ndescription of each action follows.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          1.  Appellant alleges  that when he was transferred\n\nto Old Colony, prison  officials refused to allow him  to use\n\nhis television  set with speakers; instead,  he was required,\n\nunder  regulations apparently  promulgated  in 1983,  to  use\n\nearplugs or headphones.   He claims that this  rule was an ex\n                                                             \n\npost  facto  violation  of  the  United  States  Constitution\n           \n\nbecause  appellant had been  allowed the use  of a television\n\nset with speakers since the beginning of his incarceration in\n\n1979.    He  also  maintained  that  his  civil  rights  were\n\ninfringed on the  ground that the regulation  did not contain\n\nan exception  that allowed hearing-impaired  prisoners to use\n\ntelevision  sets   with  speakers.    In   this  action,  the\n\n                             -2-\n\ndefendants were served with process.  They filed their answer\n\nin May 1989.\n\n          2.  Because appellant had enemies at Old Colony and\n\nbecause Old Colony lacked  a protection unit, appellant avers\n\nthat he  was forced  into administrative segregation  for the\n\ntwenty-seven  days he spent at Old Colony.  During this time,\n\nappellant  claims that  he  was denied  proper medical  care.\n\nSpecifically, prison  officials  allegedly refused  to  allow\n\nappellant to bring  with him  two knee braces  he needed  for\n\nsupport.    He  further  alleged  that  he  did  not  receive\n\nsufficient  daily  exercise and  did  not  have  access to  a\n\n\"universal\" weight machine.  In addition to these complaints,\n\nappellant states that the  prison officials refused to ensure\n\nthat all  of his mail was  being sent out, that  the transfer\n\nmade it difficult for him to receive visitors and that, after\n\n\"punching out\" two glass windows, appellant was placed in the\n\n\"nut  room\"  and threatened  with  the  possibility of  being\n\nchained  to the bed.   None of  the defendants named  in this\n\naction were served with process.\n\n          3.  Appellant states  that while in the segregation\n\nunit  he did  not have  access, as did  the prisoners  in the\n\ngeneral  population, to  a footlocker in  which to  store his\n\npersonal belongings.   He also claims that  defendants used a\n\ntwo-way window  and an electronic eavesdropping  sound gun to\n\nmonitor  all of appellant's visits with outsiders.  As in the\n\n                             -3-\n\npreviously   described  action,  appellant  failed  to  serve\n\ndefendants with his complaint.\n\n          4.  In the fourth complaint, appellant alleges that\n\nin 1985 he was transferred to a higher security prison as the\n\nresult  of   allegations  he  had  made  concerning  employee\n\ndiscrimination in  the Massachusetts  prison system.   Due to\n\nhis  involvement in  this matter,  appellant asserts  that he\n\nbecame known  as  a legal  and  political troublemaker.    He\n\ncharges that he made defendants aware of the fact that due to\n\nthe  above allegations,  he had  enemies at  Old Colony.   He\n\nagain asserts that  he needed to be placed  in administrative\n\nsegregation at Old  Colony --  the only place  where he  felt\n\nsafe.  All of the defendants were served with process in this\n\naction and they filed answers in May 1989.\n\n          5.      Appellant  claims   that  under   a  prison\n\nregulation,  an inmate  who refuses  to transfer  to  a lower\n\nsecurity prison  loses work  privileges, is not  permitted to\n\nattend  vocational,  educational   and  other   institutional\n\nprograms, and is  not allowed  to attend  church.   Appellant\n\nasserts  that he lost the above privileges due to his refusal\n\nto transfer to  a medium  security prison.   In this  action,\n\nappellant served the defendants and in 1990 sent requests for\n\nadmissions to them.\n\n                             -4-\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          On  March  11,  1992,  the  district  court  issued\n\nnotices  in all  five actions  pursuant to  Local Rule  41.1.\n\nThis rule provides:\n\n               (a)(1)  Whenever in any civil action\n          the   clerk   shall  ascertain   that  no\n          proceeding has been docketed  therein for\n          a period  of ONE (1) year,  he shall then\n          mail  notice  to  all  persons  who  have\n          entered  an  appearance  in such  a  case\n          that,  subject  to   the  provisions   of\n          subsection  (a)(3),  the  case   will  be\n          dismissed  without further  notice thirty\n          (30)  days  after  the  sending   of  the\n          notice.\n\nIn  response to  this notice,  appellant requested  an eight-\n\nmonth  extension of  time.   He  based  this request  on  his\n\nassertions  that since the filing of the five actions in 1989\n\nthe  Department   of   Corrections  (DOC)   had   confiscated\n\nappellant's legal  papers and had  failed to  return them  to\n\nappellant, had opened appellant's  legal mail, had denied him\n\naccess to the law library during \"lock downs\" and had made it\n\ndifficult for him to obtain typewriting materials.\n\n          The  district court  denied appellant's  motion and\n\ndismissed the  five  actions.   The  court accepted  as  true\n\nappellant's  allegation   that  his  legal  files   had  been\n\nconfiscated.    It  nonetheless   found  that  this  did  not\n\n\"satisfactorily explain\" appellant's inaction and his failure\n\nto communicate with the district court.\n\n                             -5-\n\n                             III.\n                                \n\n          A district  court's sua sponte power  to dismiss an\n                                        \n\naction  for  want of  prosecution  is  \"'an inherent  power,'\n\ngoverned  not   by  rule  or  statute  but   by  the  control\n\nnecessarily vested in the courts  to manage their own affairs\n\nso  as to achieve the orderly  and expeditious disposition of\n\ncases.\"    Link v.

Among the pertinent\n\nfactors we  consider are the  history of the  litigation, the\n\nlength and  type  of  delay, the  nature  of  the  underlying\n\n                             -6-\n\nclaims, the possible prejudice to defendants and the presence\n\nof  an  adequate excuse  for  a  plaintiff's  inaction.

This in itself\n\nsuffices for a finding of  lack of prosecution.  See id.   In\n                                                        \n\ntwo out of the three actions in which  service of process was\n\naccomplished, appellant took no steps to further the progress\n\nof the  actions after the answers were filed in 1989.  In the\n\none  action  where the  proceedings  did  advance beyond  the\n\nfiling of  the defendants'  answers, appellant  sent requests\n\nfor admissions  to the DOC in  July 1990.  Thus,  by the time\n\nthe  Local Rule 41.1 notice was sent in March 1992, appellant\n\nhad done nothing  in four of the cases for almost three years\n\nand in the fifth case for well over one year.\n\n          A clear  record of delay \"measured in years,\" as in\n\nthe  case at  hand,  will support  a  dismissal for  want  of\n\nprosecution.  See Cosme Nieves v. Deshler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492514\"><a href=\"/opinion/492514/angel-m-cosme-nieves-v-col-robert-c-deshler-co-fort-buchanan/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir.  1987).    Appellant  asserts  on  appeal  that  he  did\n\n\"everything possible\" to alert the DOC and the district court\n\nto the problem of the missing legal files and interference by\n\nprison  officials   with  his  personal   papers  and   mail.\n\nSpecifically,  he states that he  filed a protective order in\n\n                             -7-\n\nthe  district  court  in  1990.   To  support  his  position,\n\nappellant refers to the first addendum to his brief.  While a\n\nreview of the material included in addendum #1 indicates that\n\nappellant  pursued his  complaints within the  prison system,\n\nthere is  no evidence  that appellant contacted  the district\n\ncourt in any  way to alert it to his  difficulties.  The only\n\nreference  to  a protective  order  is  in papers  concerning\n\nanother action filed by appellant in the district court.\n\n          We  find appellant's  excuse inadequate  to explain\n\nsuch long delays  in the  prosecution of these  actions.   In\n\nlight of  appellant's knowledge  in 1989 that  he would  have\n\ndifficulty  in  pursuing  his complaints  due  to defendants'\n\nalleged obstructive  conduct, he was in a  position to appeal\n\nto the district  court for  relief.  See  Medeiros v.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"378077\"><a href=\"/opinion/378077/joseph-medeiros-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470  (1st Cir. 1980)  (where plaintiff\n      \n\nknew about unavailability of expert witness for approximately\n\nfive months prior to trial date and  was, as a result, unable\n\nto  proceed on  day  of trial,  dismissal warranted);  Zavala\n                                                             \n\nSantiago, 553 F.2d at 713 (initial burden to go forward is on\n        \n\nplaintiff  and failure to alert district court to problems is\n\none factor  supporting dismissal  for failure  to prosecute).\n\nThis  is not a case  where, although a  significant amount of\n\ntime had passed between  the filing of the complaint  and the\n\ndismissal  for want  of  prosecution, the  parties diligently\n\nacted to advance  the case.   See Richman  v.

Rather, appellant essentially did nothing.\n\n          In light of his ability, as the district noted  and\n\nappellant himself acknowledges, to  pursue his other  federal\n\nactions, his inertia in these cases becomes less supportable.\n\nAlthough appellant's conduct  cannot be called  contumacious,\n\nit is plain that he has unreasonably delayed in advancing his\n\ncauses  of action and in  applying to the  district court for\n\nrelief.  Indeed, his request for  an eight-month extension of\n\ntime in response  to the notice of dismissal  only highlights\n\nthe  likelihood that  appellant  will continue  to  act in  a\n\ndilatory manner.  In  such a situation, dismissal is  not too\n\nharsh a sanction.  See Medeiros, 621 F.2d at 470-71 (delay by\n                               \n\nplaintiff  in  availing himself  of  discovery,  although not\n\n\"contumacious,\" is  a sufficient  ground for dismissal).   We\n\nalso note  that the  merits of appellant's  underlying claims\n\nare questionable  and that the  long pendency of  this action\n\nhas likely resulted  on prejudice  to defendants.   Thus,  we\n\ncannot say that  the district court abused its  discretion in\n\ndismissing the  complaints under  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  41(b) and\n\nLocal Rule 41.1.\n\n          The judgments of the district court are affirmed.\n                                                          \n\n                             -9-\n</pre>",
