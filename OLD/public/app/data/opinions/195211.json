This is a suit by the owners  of\n                          \n\nfederal savings bonds that were allegedly stolen and redeemed\n\nwithout the owners' permission.  The district court dismissed\n\nthe suit on the ground that it had been brought in  the wrong\n\ncourt.  With certain clarifications, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     In this case Victor and Betty Zelman, a husband and wife\n\nresiding in  Maine, brought  suit pro  se  in district  court\n                                         \n\nagainst the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of\n\nthe Public Debt.   Their complaint alleged that  six series E\n\nbonds issued to  one or both of the  Zelmans, currently worth\n\n(in total) more  than $10,000, had been stolen  from them and\n\nthat  the government was now refusing to issue replacements.1\n\nClaiming  that the  government had  breached the  contractual\n\nrights   reflected  in  the  bonds,  the  Zelmans  sought  an\n\ninjunction to require the issuance of replacements.  \n\n     Prior  to  bringing  suit,  the  Zelmans  had  requested\n\nreplacements from the Bureau of Public Debt which administers\n\nthe  savings bond  program for  the Treasury.   In  reply the\n\nBureau told  the Zelmans  the following:   first,  government\n\nrecords showed the bonds to  have been redeemed more than ten\n\n                    \n\n     1The series E  bonds assertedly stolen from  the Zelmans\nappear  to  have  been registered  bonds  rather  than bearer\nbonds.  See 31 C.F.R.   315.5 (\"Savings bonds are issued only\n           \nin  registered form. . . .  The registration is conclusive of\nownership,  except as  provided  in     315.49  [relating  to\ncorrection of error in registration].\").\n\n                             -2-\n\nyears   ago;   second,   government  regulations   create   a\n\npresumption that redeemed bonds have been properly paid if no\n\nclaims have been  filed within ten  years of redemption;  and\n\nthird,  since the  government now  retains  no other  records\n\nafter ten years has elapsed following redemption, \"no details\n\nregarding .  . .  redemption [of the  Zelmans' bonds]  can be\n\nfurnished.\"\n\n     Broadly  speaking   and  with   certain  qualifications,\n\ngovernment  bonds  are   viewed  as  contracts  between   the\n\ngovernment and the owners, whose terms are fixed by statutes,\n\nregulations  and  offering  circulars.   Estate  of  Curry v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States,  409 F.2d 671,  675 (6th Cir. 1969);  Wolak v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited States,  366 F.  Supp. 1106,  1111-12 (D.  Conn. 1973)\n             \n\n(collecting and quoting numerous cases).  In response  to the\n\nZelmans' suit, which explicitly alleged a breach of contract,\n\nthe U.S.  Attorney asserted  that the  district court  lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction  over the suit.  This  is so, the\n\nU.S. Attorney argued in a motion to dismiss, because contract\n\nclaims  against the United States for amounts of over $10,000\n\nmay  be  brought only  in  the Claims  Court.   28  U.S.C.   \n\n1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1).  \n\n     The district  court agreed with the  government, stating\n\nthat \"since this is an action for breach of contract and more\n\nthan $10,000  is  at  stake, the  Tucker  Act  provides  that\n\njurisdiction exists only in the  . . . Claims  Court . . . .\"\n\n                             -3-\n\nNoting that no request for such a transfer had been made, see\n                                                             \n\n28 U.S.C.    1631, the district court dismissed  the case for\n\nwant of jurisdiction and without prejudice to a new action in\n\na court with jurisdiction.  The Zelmans have sought review in\n\nthis court, arguing that the dismissal was improper  and that\n\nredress apart from damages should be afforded to them.\n\n                             II.\n\n     On appeal, the Zelmans first argue that each bond should\n\nbe treated  as a  separate contract  and that,  individually,\n\neach such claim  in this case is under $10,000 and within the\n\njurisdiction  of the district court.  The government responds\n\nthat  there  is  \"some authority\"  for  the  proposition that\n\nseparate  claims for under $10,000 should not be aggregated;2\n\nbut  it   says  that   the  district   court  still   \"lacked\n\njurisdiction\" to afford the only remedy sought by the Zelmans\n\nin  this case, namely, an injunction directing re-issuance of\n\nthe bonds.   Indeed, we  have held that \"[f]ederal  courts do\n\nnot  have  the power  to  order specific  performance  by the\n\nUnited  States  of   its  alleged  contractual  obligations.\"\n\nCoggeshall Development Corp.  v.

United  States, 722  F.2d 517,  518\n                                        \n(9th  Cir. 1983);  United States  v.

Cooper,\n                      \nFederal Practice and Procedure,   3647 at 287 (2d ed. 1985).\n                              \n\n                             -4-\n\n     One  could argue  about  whether \"jurisdiction\"--a  term\n\nwith many shades of meaning--is  lacking if the complaint has\n\nasserted  a  colorable claim  (in  this case,  for  breach of\n\ncontract) but named  an unavailable remedy.   But the Zelmans\n\ndid not  argue to the district  court that the claims  may be\n\ndisaggregated  (although  two sentences  in  their memorandum\n\nhinted at such an argument)  and even now the government does\n\nnot quite  concede the point.   We are reluctant  to overturn\n\nthe district court in a  civil suit based on a disaggregation\n\ntheory not raised in that court.  Indeed, the government does\n\nnot confess error  on this issue and  may dispute or hope  to\n\ndistinguish the disaggregation precedents.\n\n     Accordingly,  we  are  disposed to  affirm  the district\n\ncourt but without  prejudice to the Zelmans' filing  of a new\n\nsuit  in the same district court if they wish to pursue their\n\ndisaggregation theory.  We say \"if\" because  the Claims Court\n\nhas unquestioned jurisdiction, assuming that the  Zelmans are\n\nnow prepared to accept damages  as their relief.  The Zelmans\n\nmight prefer to refile their suit in the Maine district court\n\nor they might  conclude that the Claims  Court, although more\n\ndistant, is  a preferable  forum  in order  to avoid  another\n\npossible round  of jurisdictional  controversy.   The initial\n\nchoice is theirs.\n\n     But we  have something more  to say about the  course of\n\nthis matter.  The pages of correspondence between the Zelmans\n\n                             -5-\n\nand  the  Treasury's  Bureau  of  the  Public  Debt  will  be\n\nfamiliar, at least as a prototype, to anyone who has ventured\n\nto assert a money claim against a public  body.  Although the\n\nBureau's letters to the Zelmans  (and later to their senator)\n\nmay well  be accurate  in a literal  sense, most  lay readers\n\nwould  likely  believe  that the  Bureau  had  determined the\n\nZelmans' claim to be without merit.   The critical sentences,\n\nrepeated in several of the letters, are these:\n\n          [T]he regulations governing savings bonds\n          provide that bonds for which no claim has\n          been  filed   within  10  years   of  the\n          recorded  date  of   redemption  will  be\n          presumed to have been properly paid.   At\n          that  time, the  payment records  of such\n          bonds  are  destroyed  and  from then  on\n          there  is no  data  available from  which\n          photographs  or  other  details regarding\n          the redemption can be obtained.\n\n     The  critical phrase,  \"presumed  to have  been properly\n\npaid,\"  is   taken  verbatim   from   the  current   Treasury\n\nregulations, 31 C.F.R.    315.29(b), although the  regulation\n\nin question is not cited in the letters.  The word \"presumed\"\n\nhas more  than one  meaning but  it quite  often refers to  a\n\nrebuttable presumption; that  is, when the predicate  fact is\n\nproved  (here, that the  bonds were redeemed  by someone over\n\nten years ago), then  some other \"presumed\" fact (here,  that\n\nthe bonds were  redeemed by their real owners)  will be taken\n\nto be true--unless and until the party disputing the presumed\n\nfact offers substantial countervailing evidence.  See Fed. R.\n                                                     \n\n                             -6-\n\nEvid. 301; 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence   342 (4th  Ed.\n                                             \n\n1992).3 \n\n     Assuming for purposes of discussion that  the regulation\n\nrefers to  a rebuttable  presumption, then  quite likely  the\n\nZelmans have  the burden  of offering  evidence to  establish\n\nthat the  bonds were  stolen from them  and if  redeemed were\n\nredeemed  without their permission.   They might  have such a\n\nburden even  without the  presumption.   The  Zelmans may  be\n\nhindered because  the  Bureau has apparently disposed  of the\n\nrecords  of redemption  apart  from  recording  the  fact  of\n\nredemption.    Still,  a factfinder  might  well  believe the\n\nZelmans, especially if they can corroborate the theft of  the\n\nbonds.   Stolen bonds are  unlikely to have been  redeemed by\n\ntheir rightful owner.\n\n     If the Bureau regards the presumption as rebuttable, one\n\nmight expect  at least one of its letters  to say this to the\n\nZelmans  in plain  language and,  further, to tell  them what\n\nprocess  (a review  board, a  court)  is available  to get  a\n\ndecision on the factual issue.   If instead the Bureau thinks\n\n                    \n\n     3Occasionally the term \"presumption\" is used to indicate\nthat  the  presumed  fact  is  conclusively  or  irrebuttably\npresumed and  the opponent  will not be  allowed to  show the\ncontrary.  See e.g., Stanley  v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 656-\n                                         \n57  (1972) (voiding  irrebuttable  statutory presumption);  2\nMcCormick at 451.  And,  to make matters even more confusing,\n         \nthe term  is sometimes  used to refer  to a  mere permissible\ninference.  See  County Court of Ulster County  v. Allen, 442\n                                                        \nU.S.  140, 157 (1979)  (referring to \"an  entirely permissive\ninference  or   presumption,  which   allows--but  does   not\nrequire\"--an inference of one fact from proof of another).\n\n                             -7-\n\nthat  the regulation  creates an  irrebuttable presumption--a\n\nkind  of mini-statute of  limitations--then it ought  to have\n\nsaid so plainly  to the Zelmans.   To leave  the matter in  a\n\nstate of confusion is not an attractive posture for an agency\n\nthat must face this very issue with some frequency.\n\n     The  government is  a huge  body  employing millions  of\n\npeople,  and  needs  to use  regulations,  routines  and form\n\nletters.  It is also right  that its servants should be chary\n\nabout claims against the Treasury, claims that are often ill-\n\nfounded and sometimes dishonest.  But  it is not too much  to\n\nask that the Bureau of the Public Debt give a plain statement\n\nof  its  position--and   even  useful  directions--to   those\n\ncitizens  who have lent the government money, seek repayment,\n\nand have very little idea  how to navigate through the forest\n\nof rules and procedures.\n\n                             III.\n\n     The Zelmans'  filings, both in the district court and in\n\nthis  court, argue variously that case law supports equitable\n\nrelief; that it  is a violation of the due  process clause to\n\napply regulation    315.29(b) as a statute  of limitations to\n\nbonds  sold before the  regulation was promulgated;  and that\n\nthe  records concerning the  redemption should not  have been\n\ndestroyed since without  them the Zelmans cannot  prove their\n\ncase.    These arguments  do  not  alter  our view  that  the\n\ndistrict court should be affirmed.\n\n                             -8-\n\n     The  Zelmans' argument for equitable relief rests on the\n\nground that the  government had an obligation,  under the law\n\nas  it  existed when  the  bonds were  purchased,  to replace\n                                                             \n\nstolen  bonds that  have  been  improperly  redeemed.    This\n\nargument is  difficult to appraise  because the  text of  the\n\nprovisions relied  upon by the  Zelmans is not quoted  by the\n\nZelmans,  and the  statutes  and  regulations  to  which  the\n\nZelmans cite do not clearly set forth the obligation that the\n\nZelmans impute.4   Whether such an  obligation might be  made\n\nout, however, is an issue we need not determine.\n\n     On  the  Zelmans'   own  version  of  the   matter,  the\n\nobligation  on which  they rely  existed  under statutory  or\n\nregulatory language that  has since been repealed.   Although\n\ntheir position is not clearly explained, they may  be arguing\n\nthat the  procedures and  remedies that  applied in 1968  and\n\n1969 were incorporated into the bond contracts by implication\n\nor by the offering circular (which is not, however, quoted or\n\ncited).   See generally Wolak, 366  F. Supp. at  1113-14.  If\n                             \n\nthis is their argument, then  the Zelmans are back to arguing\n\n                    \n\n     4Former  31 U.S.C.   738a(a) provided that the Secretary\nof  the  Treasury,  when  it   is  \"clearly  proved  to   the\nsatisfaction of the Secretary\" that non-bearer  securities of\nthe United  States have been lost or stolen, \"shall\" re-issue\na security \"which  has not matured or  become redeemable\" and\nshall  make  payment  on  one  that \"has  matured  or  become\nredeemable.\"  This section was supplanted in 1971 by one that\nsaid that  the Secretary  had authority to  grant relief  for\nloss  or theft  of government  securities, 85  Stat.  74; the\ncurrent  comparable version  is  31  U.S.C.     3125(a)  (The\nSecretary . . . may provide relief . . .)\".\n\n                             -9-\n\nthat  the government  has  breached  its  contract  and  that\n\nequitable relief should be afforded for this breach.\n\n     The  difficulty is  that it is  settled in  this circuit\n\nthat equitable relief  cannot be obtained on  contract claims\n\nagainst the government, Coggeshall, 884 F.2d at 3,  with very\n                                  \n\nnarrow  statutory exceptions that are  not here relevant.  28\n\nU.S.C.     1491(a)(2), (3).   This rule  may not  be followed\n\neverywhere  and it  can  be especially  hard  to apply  where\n\ncontract claims are  mingled with other claims  not dependent\n\non  contract.  See, e.g., Transohio Savings Bank v. Director,\n                                                             \n\nOffice of Thrift Supervision, 967  F.2d 598 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n                            \n\nHowever, the rule remains the law of this circuit and may not\n\nnormally be reconsidered except by the court en banc.5\n                                                    \n\n     The  Zelmans'  next  argument is  that  it  violates due\n\nprocess  for the  government  to  impose, through  regulation\n\n315.29, a ten-year  statute of limitations (measured  from an\n\nillegal  redemption)  on  requests  by  rightful  owners  for\n\nreplacement  or  payment  of their  stolen  bonds.   No  such\n\nregulation  existed, say the  Zelmans, when their  bonds were\n\npurchased; and (they  say) their bonds have  been extended by\n\n                    \n\n     5As already  noted, the Zelmans have not  pointed to any\nlaw currently in  force that gives them a  statutory right to\nre-issuance  of the  bonds (as  opposed to  damages based  on\nbreach of  contract).  Thus  we have no occasion  to consider\nwhether or  when--despite the  Tucker  Act--a district  court\nmight  be  able  to grant  injunctive  relief,  with monetary\nimplications, based on statute rather than contract.

As we  have already noted,  the regulation  on its\n\nface is  susceptible to  a quite  different reading,  namely,\n\nthat  it creates a rebuttable presumption (starting ten years\n\nafter  a redemption) that  the bonds were  lawfully redeemed.\n\nThis  in turn would  leave it open  to the rightful  owner to\n\nshow that the bonds were lost or stolen and were not redeemed\n\nby the rightful owner.  \n\n     The Zelmans, appearing pro se, may misunderstand what is\n                                  \n\nentailed in a  showing of this kind.   It would not  be their\n\nautomatic obligation to establish the details of the theft or\n\nidentify the party  who wrongfully redeemed  the bonds.   One\n\nmight expect them to shed some  light on where the bonds were\n\nkept, how they might have been purloined, why it took so long\n\nto discover  the loss, whether  the loss was reported  to the\n\npolice,  and what  investigations were  made;  but these  are\n\nmatters that  go to plausibility  and corroboration.   If the\n\nZelmans tell a plausible story, nothing prevents the trier of\n\nfact from accepting it.\n\n                             -11-\n\n     As for the  details of the redemption, all  that a trier\n\nof fact  would likely  demand from  the Zelmans  is testimony\n\nthat they did not redeem  the bonds, did not authorize anyone\n\nto do so,  and have no  idea who did  redeem the bonds.   The\n\nfact that  the government has  destroyed the records  is more\n\nlikely  to inconvenience it rather than the Zelmans, assuming\n\nthat they have a plausible story to tell.  Of course,  we are\n\nproceeding on the arguendo premise that the regulation is not\n                          \n\na  statute  of  limitations;  but  if  it  is  a  statute  of\n\nlimitations,  the  destruction  of  the  records is  probably\n\nirrelevant anyway.  \n\n     We  do not  know whether the  Zelmans will  refile their\n\ncontract claim lawsuit in the district court or in the Claims\n\nCourt.  But we trust that, once a  forum with jurisdiction is\n\nchosen, government counsel will pay some mind to the question\n\nwhether the Zelmans have a valid claim against the government\n\nor  how to  get this  issue  decided at  minimum expense  and\n\nwithout further delay.  Thus far, this case is not much of an\n\nadvertisement for savings bonds.\n\n     The judgment of  the district court is  affirmed without\n                                                     \n\nprejudice to the filing of a  new suit for damages either  in\n\nthe  Claims  Court  or  in the  district  court  (subject  to\n\nresolution of the disaggregation issue).

The district court dismissed the suit on the ground that it had been brought in the wrong court.  With certain clarifications, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case Victor and Betty Zelman, a husband and wife residing in Maine, brought suit pro se in district court against the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of the Public Debt.  Their complaint alleged that six series E bonds issued to one or both of the Zelmans, currently worth (in total) more than $10,000, had been stolen from them and that the government was now refusing to issue replacements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Claiming that the government had breached the contractual rights reflected in the bonds, the Zelmans sought an injunction to require the issuance of replacements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to bringing suit, the Zelmans had requested replacements from the Bureau of Public Debt which administers the savings bond program for the Treasury.  In reply the Bureau told the Zelmans the following:  first, government records showed the bonds to have been redeemed more than ten years ago;  second, government regulations create a presumption that redeemed bonds have been properly paid if no claims have been filed within ten years of redemption;  and third, since the government now retains no other records after ten years has elapsed following redemption, \"no details regarding ... redemption [of the Zelmans' bonds] can be furnished.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Broadly speaking and with certain qualifications, government bonds are viewed as contracts between the government and the owners, whose terms are fixed by statutes, regulations and offering circulars.  Estate of Curry v. United States, 409 F.2d 671, 675 (6th Cir.1969);  Wolak v. United States, 366 F.Supp. 1106, 1111-12 (D.Conn.1973) (collecting and quoting numerous cases).  In response to the Zelmans' suit, which explicitly alleged a breach of contract, the U.S. Attorney asserted that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.  This is so, the U.S. Attorney argued in a motion to dismiss, because contract claims against the United States for amounts of over $10,000 may be brought only in the Claims Court.  28 U.S.C. Secs. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with the government, stating that \"since this is an action for breach of contract and more than $10,000 is at stake, the Tucker Act provides that jurisdiction exists only in the ... Claims Court....\"  Noting that no request for such a transfer had been made, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1631, the district court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction and without prejudice to a new action in a court with jurisdiction.  The Zelmans have sought review in this court, arguing that the dismissal was improper and that redress apart from damages should be afforded to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Zelmans first argue that each bond should be treated as a separate contract and that, individually, each such claim in this case is under $10,000 and within the jurisdiction of the district court.  The government responds that there is \"some authority\" for the proposition that separate claims for under $10,000 should not be aggregated;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  but it says that the district court still \"lacked jurisdiction\" to afford the only remedy sought by the Zelmans in this case, namely, an injunction directing re-issuance of the bonds.  Indeed, we have held that \"[f]ederal courts do not have the power to order specific performance by the United States of its alleged contractual obligations.\"  Coggeshall Development Corp. v. Diamond, 884 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One could argue about whether \"jurisdiction\"--a term with many shades of meaning--is lacking if the complaint has asserted a colorable claim (in this case, for breach of contract) but named an unavailable remedy.  But the Zelmans did not argue to the district court that the claims may be disaggregated (although two sentences in their memorandum hinted at such an argument) and even now the government does not quite concede the point.  We are reluctant to overturn the district court in a civil suit based on a disaggregation theory not raised in that court.  Indeed, the government does not confess error on this issue and may dispute or hope to distinguish the disaggregation precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we are disposed to affirm the district court but without prejudice to the Zelmans' filing of a new suit in the same district court if they wish to pursue their disaggregation theory.  We say \"if\" because the Claims Court has unquestioned jurisdiction, assuming that the Zelmans are now prepared to accept damages as their relief.  The Zelmans might prefer to refile their suit in the Maine district court or they might conclude that the Claims Court, although more distant, is a preferable forum in order to avoid another possible round of jurisdictional controversy.  The initial choice is theirs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we have something more to say about the course of this matter.  The pages of correspondence between the Zelmans and the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt will be familiar, at least as a prototype, to anyone who has ventured to assert a money claim against a public body.  Although the Bureau's letters to the Zelmans (and later to their senator) may well be accurate in a literal sense, most lay readers would likely believe that the Bureau had determined the Zelmans' claim to be without merit.  The critical sentences, repeated in several of the letters, are these:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[T]he regulations governing savings bonds provide that bonds for which no claim has been filed within 10 years of the recorded date of redemption will be presumed to have been properly paid.  At that time, the payment records of such bonds are destroyed and from then on there is no data available from which photographs or other details regarding the redemption can be obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical phrase, \"presumed to have been properly paid,\" is taken verbatim from the current Treasury regulations, 31 C.F.R. Sec. 315.29(b), although the regulation in question is not cited in the letters.  The word \"presumed\" has more than one meaning but it quite often refers to a rebuttable presumption;  that is, when the predicate fact is proved (here, that the bonds were redeemed by someone over ten years ago), then some other \"presumed\" fact (here, that the bonds were redeemed by their real owners) will be taken to be true--unless and until the party disputing the presumed fact offers substantial countervailing evidence.  See Fed.R.Evid. 301;  2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence Sec. 342 (4th Ed.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming for purposes of discussion that the regulation refers to a rebuttable presumption, then quite likely the Zelmans have the burden of offering evidence to establish that the bonds were stolen from them and if redeemed were redeemed without their permission.  They might have such a burden even without the presumption.  The Zelmans may be hindered because the Bureau has apparently disposed of the records of redemption apart from recording the fact of redemption.  Still, a factfinder might well believe the Zelmans, especially if they can corroborate the theft of the bonds.  Stolen bonds are unlikely to have been redeemed by their rightful owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Bureau regards the presumption as rebuttable, one might expect at least one of its letters to say this to the Zelmans in plain language and, further, to tell them what process (a review board, a court) is available to get a decision on the factual issue.  If instead the Bureau thinks that the regulation creates an irrebuttable presumption--a kind of mini-statute of limitations--then it ought to have said so plainly to the Zelmans.  To leave the matter in a state of confusion is not an attractive posture for an agency that must face this very issue with some frequency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government is a huge body employing millions of people, and needs to use regulations, routines and form letters.  It is also right that its servants should be chary about claims against the Treasury, claims that are often ill-founded and sometimes dishonest.  But it is not too much to ask that the Bureau of the Public Debt give a plain statement of its position--and even useful directions--to those citizens who have lent the government money, seek repayment, and have very little idea how to navigate through the forest of rules and procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Zelmans' filings, both in the district court and in this court, argue variously that case law supports equitable relief;  that it is a violation of the due process clause to apply regulation Sec. 315.29(b) as a statute of limitations to bonds sold before the regulation was promulgated;  and that the records concerning the redemption should not have been destroyed since without them the Zelmans cannot prove their case.  These arguments do not alter our view that the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Zelmans' argument for equitable relief rests on the ground that the government had an obligation, under the law as it existed when the bonds were purchased, to replace stolen bonds that have been improperly redeemed.  This argument is difficult to appraise because the text of the provisions relied upon by the Zelmans is not quoted by the Zelmans, and the statutes and regulations to which the Zelmans cite do not clearly set forth the obligation that the Zelmans impute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Whether such an obligation might be made out, however, is an issue we need not determine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the Zelmans' own version of the matter, the obligation on which they rely existed under statutory or regulatory language that has since been repealed.  Although their position is not clearly explained, they may be arguing that the procedures and remedies that applied in 1968 and 1969 were incorporated into the bond contracts by implication or by the offering circular (which is not, however, quoted or cited).  See generally Wolak, 366 F.Supp. at 1113-14.   If this is their argument, then the Zelmans are back to arguing that the government has breached its contract and that equitable relief should be afforded for this breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty is that it is settled in this circuit that equitable relief cannot be obtained on contract claims against the government, Coggeshall, 884 F.2d at 3, with very narrow statutory exceptions that are not here relevant.  28 U.S.C. Secs. 1491(a)(2), (3).  This rule may not be followed everywhere and it can be especially hard to apply where contract claims are mingled with other claims not dependent on contract.  See, e.g., Transohio Savings Bank v. Director, Office of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598 (D.C.Cir.1992).  However, the rule remains the law of this circuit and may not normally be reconsidered except by the court en banc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Zelmans' next argument is that it violates due process for the government to impose, through regulation 315.29, a ten-year statute of limitations (measured from an illegal redemption) on requests by rightful owners for replacement or payment of their stolen bonds.  No such regulation existed, say the Zelmans, when their bonds were purchased;  and (they say) their bonds have been extended by the Treasury for thirty years past their original maturity so the Zelmans had no earlier reason to inquire into their theft or illegal redemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It will be time enough for the courts to consider such a constitutional attack on the regulation if and when the government endorses the reading of the regulation as a statute of limitations and if and when the courts accept that reading.  As we have already noted, the regulation on its face is susceptible to a quite different reading, namely, that it creates a rebuttable presumption (starting ten years after a redemption) that the bonds were lawfully redeemed.  This in turn would leave it open to the rightful owner to show that the bonds were lost or stolen and were not redeemed by the rightful owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Zelmans, appearing pro se, may misunderstand what is entailed in a showing of this kind.  It would not be their automatic obligation to establish the details of the theft or identify the party who wrongfully redeemed the bonds.  One might expect them to shed some light on where the bonds were kept, how they might have been purloined, why it took so long to discover the loss, whether the loss was reported to the police, and what investigations were made;  but these are matters that go to plausibility and corroboration.  If the Zelmans tell a plausible story, nothing prevents the trier of fact from accepting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the details of the redemption, all that a trier of fact would likely demand from the Zelmans is testimony that they did not redeem the bonds, did not authorize anyone to do so, and have no idea who did redeem the bonds.  The fact that the government has destroyed the records is more likely to inconvenience it rather than the Zelmans, assuming that they have a plausible story to tell.  Of course, we are proceeding on the arguendo premise that the regulation is not a statute of limitations;  but if it is a statute of limitations, the destruction of the records is probably irrelevant anyway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not know whether the Zelmans will refile their contract claim lawsuit in the district court or in the Claims Court.  But we trust that, once a forum with jurisdiction is chosen, government counsel will pay some mind to the question whether the Zelmans have a valid claim against the government or how to get this issue decided at minimum expense and without further delay.  Thus far, this case is not much of an advertisement for savings bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed without prejudice to the filing of a new suit for damages either in the Claims Court or in the district court (subject to resolution of the disaggregation issue).  No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The series E bonds assertedly stolen from the Zelmans appear to have been registered bonds rather than bearer bonds.  See 31 C.F.R. Sec. 315.5 (\"Savings bonds are issued only in registered form....  The registration is conclusive of ownership, except as provided in Sec. 315.49 [relating to correction of error in registration].\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> See e.g., Baker v.

And, to make matters even more confusing, the term is sometimes used to refer to a mere permissible inference.  See County Court of Ulster County v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 157, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2224, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979) (referring to \"an entirely permissive inference or presumption, which allows--but does not require\"--an inference of one fact from proof of another)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Former 31 U.S.C.

In reply the Bureau told the Zelmans the following:  first, government records showed the bonds to have been redeemed more than ten years ago;  second, government regulations create a presumption that redeemed bonds have been properly paid if no claims have been filed within ten years of redemption;  and third, since the government now retains no other records after ten years has elapsed following redemption, \"no details regarding ... redemption [of the Zelmans' bonds] can be furnished.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Broadly speaking and with certain qualifications, government bonds are viewed as contracts between the government and the owners, whose terms are fixed by statutes, regulations and offering circulars.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span>, 1111-12 (D.Conn.1973) (collecting and quoting numerous cases).  In response to the Zelmans' suit, which explicitly alleged a breach of contract, the U.S. Attorney asserted that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.  This is so, the U.S. Attorney argued in a motion to dismiss, because contract claims against the United States for amounts of over $10,000 may be brought only in the Claims Court.  28 U.S.C. Secs. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with the government, stating that \"since this is an action for breach of contract and more than $10,000 is at stake, the Tucker Act provides that jurisdiction exists only in the ... Claims Court....\"  Noting that no request for such a transfer had been made, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1631, the district court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction and without prejudice to a new action in a court with jurisdiction.  The Zelmans have sought review in this court, arguing that the dismissal was improper and that redress apart from damages should be afforded to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Zelmans first argue that each bond should be treated as a separate contract and that, individually, each such claim in this case is under $10,000 and within the jurisdiction of the district court.  The government responds that there is \"some authority\" for the proposition that separate claims for under $10,000 should not be aggregated;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  but it says that the district court still \"lacked jurisdiction\" to afford the only remedy sought by the Zelmans in this case, namely, an injunction directing re-issuance of the bonds.  Indeed, we have held that \"[f]ederal courts do not have the power to order specific performance by the United States of its alleged contractual obligations.\"  Coggeshall Development Corp. v. Diamond, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528439\"><a href=\"/opinion/528439/coggeshall-development-corp-v-william-j-diamond-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One could argue about whether \"jurisdiction\"--a term with many shades of meaning--is lacking if the complaint has asserted a colorable claim (in this case, for breach of contract) but named an unavailable remedy.  But the Zelmans did not argue to the district court that the claims may be disaggregated (although two sentences in their memorandum hinted at such an argument) and even now the government does not quite concede the point.  We are reluctant to overturn the district court in a civil suit based on a disaggregation theory not raised in that court.  Indeed, the government does not confess error on this issue and may dispute or hope to distinguish the disaggregation precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we are disposed to affirm the district court but without prejudice to the Zelmans' filing of a new suit in the same district court if they wish to pursue their disaggregation theory.  We say \"if\" because the Claims Court has unquestioned jurisdiction, assuming that the Zelmans are now prepared to accept damages as their relief.  The Zelmans might prefer to refile their suit in the Maine district court or they might conclude that the Claims Court, although more distant, is a preferable forum in order to avoid another possible round of jurisdictional controversy.  The initial choice is theirs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we have something more to say about the course of this matter.  The pages of correspondence between the Zelmans and the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt will be familiar, at least as a prototype, to anyone who has ventured to assert a money claim against a public body.  Although the Bureau's letters to the Zelmans (and later to their senator) may well be accurate in a literal sense, most lay readers would likely believe that the Bureau had determined the Zelmans' claim to be without merit.  The critical sentences, repeated in several of the letters, are these:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[T]he regulations governing savings bonds provide that bonds for which no claim has been filed within 10 years of the recorded date of redemption will be presumed to have been properly paid.  At that time, the payment records of such bonds are destroyed and from then on there is no data available from which photographs or other details regarding the redemption can be obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical phrase, \"presumed to have been properly paid,\" is taken verbatim from the current Treasury regulations, 31 C.F.R. Sec. 315.29(b), although the regulation in question is not cited in the letters.  The word \"presumed\" has more than one meaning but it quite often refers to a rebuttable presumption;  that is, when the predicate fact is proved (here, that the bonds were redeemed by someone over ten years ago), then some other \"presumed\" fact (here, that the bonds were redeemed by their real owners) will be taken to be true--unless and until the party disputing the presumed fact offers substantial countervailing evidence.  See Fed.R.Evid. 301;  2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence Sec. 342 (4th Ed.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming for purposes of discussion that the regulation refers to a rebuttable presumption, then quite likely the Zelmans have the burden of offering evidence to establish that the bonds were stolen from them and if redeemed were redeemed without their permission.  They might have such a burden even without the presumption.  The Zelmans may be hindered because the Bureau has apparently disposed of the records of redemption apart from recording the fact of redemption.  Still, a factfinder might well believe the Zelmans, especially if they can corroborate the theft of the bonds.  Stolen bonds are unlikely to have been redeemed by their rightful owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Bureau regards the presumption as rebuttable, one might expect at least one of its letters to say this to the Zelmans in plain language and, further, to tell them what process (a review board, a court) is available to get a decision on the factual issue.  If instead the Bureau thinks that the regulation creates an irrebuttable presumption--a kind of mini-statute of limitations--then it ought to have said so plainly to the Zelmans.  To leave the matter in a state of confusion is not an attractive posture for an agency that must face this very issue with some frequency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government is a huge body employing millions of people, and needs to use regulations, routines and form letters.  It is also right that its servants should be chary about claims against the Treasury, claims that are often ill-founded and sometimes dishonest.  But it is not too much to ask that the Bureau of the Public Debt give a plain statement of its position--and even useful directions--to those citizens who have lent the government money, seek repayment, and have very little idea how to navigate through the forest of rules and procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Zelmans' filings, both in the district court and in this court, argue variously that case law supports equitable relief;  that it is a violation of the due process clause to apply regulation Sec. 315.29(b) as a statute of limitations to bonds sold before the regulation was promulgated;  and that the records concerning the redemption should not have been destroyed since without them the Zelmans cannot prove their case.  These arguments do not alter our view that the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Zelmans' argument for equitable relief rests on the ground that the government had an obligation, under the law as it existed when the bonds were purchased, to replace stolen bonds that have been improperly redeemed.  This argument is difficult to appraise because the text of the provisions relied upon by the Zelmans is not quoted by the Zelmans, and the statutes and regulations to which the Zelmans cite do not clearly set forth the obligation that the Zelmans impute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Whether such an obligation might be made out, however, is an issue we need not determine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the Zelmans' own version of the matter, the obligation on which they rely existed under statutory or regulatory language that has since been repealed.  Although their position is not clearly explained, they may be arguing that the procedures and remedies that applied in 1968 and 1969 were incorporated into the bond contracts by implication or by the offering circular (which is not, however, quoted or cited).  See generally Wolak, 366 F.Supp. at 1113-14.   If this is their argument, then the Zelmans are back to arguing that the government has breached its contract and that equitable relief should be afforded for this breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty is that it is settled in this circuit that equitable relief cannot be obtained on contract claims against the government, Coggeshall, 884 F.2d at 3, with very narrow statutory exceptions that are not here relevant.  28 U.S.C. Secs. 1491(a)(2), (3).  This rule may not be followed everywhere and it can be especially hard to apply where contract claims are mingled with other claims not dependent on contract.  See, e.g., Transohio Savings Bank v. Director, Office of Thrift Supervision, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585771\"><a href=\"/opinion/585771/transohio-savings-bank-v-director-office-of-thrift-supervision/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span> (D.C.Cir.1992).  However, the rule remains the law of this circuit and may not normally be reconsidered except by the court en banc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Zelmans' next argument is that it violates due process for the government to impose, through regulation 315.29, a ten-year statute of limitations (measured from an illegal redemption) on requests by rightful owners for replacement or payment of their stolen bonds.  No such regulation existed, say the Zelmans, when their bonds were purchased;  and (they say) their bonds have been extended by the Treasury for thirty years past their original maturity so the Zelmans had no earlier reason to inquire into their theft or illegal redemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It will be time enough for the courts to consider such a constitutional attack on the regulation if and when the government endorses the reading of the regulation as a statute of limitations and if and when the courts accept that reading.  As we have already noted, the regulation on its face is susceptible to a quite different reading, namely, that it creates a rebuttable presumption (starting ten years after a redemption) that the bonds were lawfully redeemed.  This in turn would leave it open to the rightful owner to show that the bonds were lost or stolen and were not redeemed by the rightful owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Zelmans, appearing pro se, may misunderstand what is entailed in a showing of this kind.  It would not be their automatic obligation to establish the details of the theft or identify the party who wrongfully redeemed the bonds.  One might expect them to shed some light on where the bonds were kept, how they might have been purloined, why it took so long to discover the loss, whether the loss was reported to the police, and what investigations were made;  but these are matters that go to plausibility and corroboration.  If the Zelmans tell a plausible story, nothing prevents the trier of fact from accepting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the details of the redemption, all that a trier of fact would likely demand from the Zelmans is testimony that they did not redeem the bonds, did not authorize anyone to do so, and have no idea who did redeem the bonds.  The fact that the government has destroyed the records is more likely to inconvenience it rather than the Zelmans, assuming that they have a plausible story to tell.  Of course, we are proceeding on the arguendo premise that the regulation is not a statute of limitations;  but if it is a statute of limitations, the destruction of the records is probably irrelevant anyway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not know whether the Zelmans will refile their contract claim lawsuit in the district court or in the Claims Court.  But we trust that, once a forum with jurisdiction is chosen, government counsel will pay some mind to the question whether the Zelmans have a valid claim against the government or how to get this issue decided at minimum expense and without further delay.  Thus far, this case is not much of an advertisement for savings bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed without prejudice to the filing of a new suit for damages either in the Claims Court or in the district court (subject to resolution of the disaggregation issue).  No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The series E bonds assertedly stolen from the Zelmans appear to have been registered bonds rather than bearer bonds.  See 31 C.F.R. Sec. 315.5 (\"Savings bonds are issued only in registered form....  The registration is conclusive of ownership, except as provided in Sec. 315.49 [relating to correction of error in registration].\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> See e.g., Baker v.
