John  Pappalardo,  United  States  Attorney,  and  Stephen  P.\n                                                                  \nHeymann, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n   \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.   Appellant Jaime  Toro-Aristizabal was\n                    \n\ncharged,  in  a multi-count  indictment,  with  conspiracy to\n\npossess  with  intent  to distribute  and  distribution  of a\n\nquantity of  cocaine between August  1986 and March  1988, in\n\nviolation  of 21  U.S.C.    846  (count  1), possession  with\n\nintent  to distribute and  distribution of cocaine  in August\n\n1986, in  violation of  21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1) (count  3) and\n\neleven  separate  incidents  of  possession  with  intent  to\n\ndistribute  cocaine (counts 4  through 14) during  the period\n\nNovember 1986 through  July 1987.  He was convicted of all of\n\nthese  violations  after  a  jury trial.    We  affirmed  his\n\nconviction on direct appeal.  See United States v. David, 940\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  722, 739  (1st  Cir.),  cert. denied,  112  S. Ct.  605\n                                          \n\n(1991).\n\n          In  this     2255   motion,  appellant  raises  his\n\ninability to pay the $20,000 fine  he received on the count 3\n\nconviction.   He  also,  in  other  pleadings  filed  in  the\n\ndistrict court, alluded  to the  following issues:   (1)  the\n\ncourt  should not have considered, in determining appellant's\n\nsentence under the sentencing  guidelines, any quantities  of\n\ncocaine  involved in transactions which occurred prior to the\n\neffective  date of the  guidelines; (2) the  sentencing court\n\nincorrectly sentenced  him to  a term  of imprisonment  which\n\nincluded  a term  of supervised  release in  violation  of 21\n\nU.S.C.     846  and  contrary  to the  policy  of  lenity  in\n\nconstruing   ambiguous   statutes;   and  (3)   he   received\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n          Subsequently,   an   attorney  was   appointed   to\n\nrepresent appellant.  He filed a new memorandum in which only\n\nthe issue concerning the fine was raised.  The district court\n\nthen  denied the  petition.   This  appeal ensued.   We  have\n\nreviewed  the parties' briefs  and the record  and affirm the\n\njudgment of  the district  court as to  the $20,000  fine for\n\nessentially  the  reasons stated  in the  court's memorandum,\n\ndated July 26, 1993.  We only add that the fine comports with\n\nthe factors listed  in 18 U.S.C.   3622(a),  which applied to\n\nthe count 3 conviction.\n\n          As  for appellant's  assertion that  he  should not\n\nhave  received a  term  of parole  or supervised  release, we\n\nfirst note  that this argument  is relevant only to  counts 3\n\nand 4 to  14.   On Count  1, he was  sentenced to  a term  of\n\nimprisonment;  this  sentence  did  not  include  a  term  of\n                                       \n\nsupervised  release  or parole.    Second,    846  applies to\n\nconspiracies.  The remaining counts did not charge violations\n\nof    846.   In  any event,  the sentences  imposed on  these\n\ncounts were not illegal.\n\n          Under count  3 --  the August  1986 conviction  for\n\npossession and distribution -- the  court sentenced appellant\n\nto 15  years imprisonment.   In  August 1986,    841(b)(1)(B)\n\nprovided that \"[a]ny sentence imposing a term of imprisonment\n\n                             -3-\n\nunder this paragraph shall . . . impose a special parole term\n\nof at least 3  years in addition to such term of imprisonment\n\n. . .  .\"  Thus, the  special parole portion of  the sentence\n\nunder count 3 is correct.\n\n          The court  sentenced  appellant  on  the  remaining\n\neleven  counts  to  concurrent   terms  of  imprisonment   of\n\nseventeen years and six months and concurrent five-year terms\n\nof  supervised  release.   These  counts  covered  the period\n\nNovember  13, 1986  to July 15,  1987.   Section 1002  of the\n\nAnti-Drug Abuse  Act of  1986, enacted on  October 27,  1986,\n\nreplaced \"special  parole term\"  with a  \"term of  supervised\n\nrelease\" for narcotic  offenses committed in violation  of 21\n\nU.S.C.   841(b)(1)(A), (B) and (C).  In the Sentencing Reform\n\nAct of  1984, however,  Congress had  deferred the  effective\n\ndate for  the elimination  of special  parole to November  1,\n\n1987.          In  Gozlon-Peretz v.  United States,  498 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n395  (1991), the  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  supervised\n\nrelease provisions of the ADAA applied for the interim period\n\nOctober 27,  1986 to November 1, 1987.   Id. at 410.  Because\n                                            \n\nthe  dates  of counts  4  to 14  fall  in  this time  period,\n\nappellant  was correctly  sentenced  to  terms of  supervised\n\nrelease.\n\n          Because appellant's sentences were legal, his claim\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel fails.  As for his claim\n\nthat the  court  erred in  calculating  his sentence  on  the\n\n                             -4-\n\nconspiracy  count  by  referring  to  conduct  predating  the\n\neffective  date  of  the  sentencing guidelines,  we  already\n\nrejected this argument in appellant's direct appeal.  See 940\n                                                         \n\nF.2d at 740.  Finally, because the grounds presented in the  \n\n2255 motion  turned on  legal issues,  we reject  appellant's\n\nclaim that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -5-\n",
