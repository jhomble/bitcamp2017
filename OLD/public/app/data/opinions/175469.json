FUSI,\n\n                       Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                                 v.\n\n                          STEVEN O’BRIEN,\n\n                       Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n            APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. Nathaniel J. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Boudin, Selya, and Gajarsa,*\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bernard Grossberg for appellant.\n     Jessica V. Barnett, Assistant Attorney General,        Criminal\nBureau, Appeals Division, with whom Martha Coakley,         Attorney\nGeneral, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                         September 16, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           GAJARSA, Circuit Judge.      Petitioner Alfred Fusi (“Fusi”)\n\nappeals from the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts’ denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nand request for an evidentiary hearing.           See Fusi v. O’Brien,\n\n588 F. Supp. 2d 158 (D. Mass. 2008).      In his habeas petition, Fusi\n\nalleged that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective\n\nassistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to prepare\n\nfor   trial.   Because   Fusi   failed    to   exhaust   his   ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim in state court, the district court\n\nshould have dismissed his petition without prejudice.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           On February 17, 1984, Fusi was convicted in Essex County\n\nSuperior Court of rape in violation of chapter 265, section 22B of\n\nMassachusetts General Laws. Fusi was sentenced to a prison term of\n\nfifteen to twenty years.    Fusi’s sentence was to begin after he\n\nfinished serving time for a previous conviction.\n\n           The district court cogently and aptly described the\n\ncircumstances surrounding Fusi’s conviction and the performance of\n\nhis initial trial counsel, Richard Chambers, as follows:\n\n      Fusi's prosecution arose out of an incident that occurred\n      on the evening of September 11, 1981. The alleged rape\n      victim in the case described how she had gone out to two\n      bars and consumed five drinks during the evening. At\n      about 2:00 a.m., the victim had an argument with her\n      boyfriend and decided to take a walk. While walking, she\n      passed a man (18 to 20 years old) who said “Hi” as she\n      passed him. When she said “Hi” in response, he hit her\n      in the jaw, knocking her temporarily unconscious. She\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fregained consciousness in a backyard where her assailant\nwas kneeling on top of her, illuminated from some light\nsource. She screamed but the man told her he would kill\nher if she did not stop screaming and stuffed a bandana\ninto her mouth.     He proceeded to rape her and then\nimmediately left the area.\nThe victim walked out to a road where after a short time,\nshe saw a friend driving by. The friend stopped and took\nher to the police station. Although the victim reported\nthe assault, she did not make a written statement about\nthe rape at that time because she felt “out of it” and\nwanted to go to the hospital to obtain treatment for her\njaw.\nThe following day, the victim leafed through a local high\nschool yearbook to try to give her friends an idea of\nwhat her assailant looked like. She did not notice that\nFusi's photograph appeared in the yearbook four times.\nSix days later, the victim returned to the police station\nwhere the police arrayed seven photographs of men\nmatching her description of the assailant. In less than\none minute, she picked out Fusi as “the man that raped\nme”. [sic]    She also positively identified him after\nlooking at the photographs a second time. At that time\nthe victim provided the police with a six-page written\nstatement describing the rape. Approximately one month\nlater, the victim returned to the police station again\nand picked Fusi out from a nine-man line-up in less than\none minute. The victim also positively identified Fusi\nas her rapist at his trial.\nThe strategy Atty. Chambers chose to adopt at Fusi's\ntrial was one of mis-identification and alibi. To that\nend, he cross-examined the Commonwealth's witnesses,\nincluding the victim at length, focusing on the victim's\nlack of opportunity to see her assailant and on\ndiscrepancies in her description of him as compared with\nhis actual appearance, such as 1) her failure to describe\na birth-mark Fusi bears on his cheek, 2) her description\nof him as olive-skinned and Italian-looking (whereas he\nwas very pale-skinned) and 3) her statement that the\nassailant weighed considerably less than Fusi actually\nweighed.\nAtty. Chambers called several witnesses to testify about\nFusi's appearance. He also called Fusi's girlfriend of\nsix years and a friend of Fusi's to testify that on the\nevening in question they were “hanging out” at Fusi's\n\n                          -3-\n\f     home. Fusi's girlfriend testified that Fusi drove her\n     home about 1:30 a.m. Fusi's mother testified that she was\n     still awake when Fusi returned home about half an hour\n     later. She also testified that she went to bed around\n     2:20 a.m. and did not hear anyone leave the house for the\n     rest of the night. At the conclusion of the trial, the\n     judge, addressing Atty. Chambers, stated, “I appreciate\n     you worked hard”. [sic] Atty. Chambers did not, however,\n     become aware of or cross-examine the victim with respect\n     to her six-page, written statement describing the rape\n     even though that statement was available for use at trial\n     and was inconsistent with the victim's testimony in\n     several ways.\nFusi, 588 F. Supp. 2d at 160-61.\n\n           At the conclusion of the initial trial, an Essex County\n\njury found Fusi guilty of rape and his conviction was subsequently\n\naffirmed by the state appellate courts.        Fusi then filed his first\n\nmotion for post-conviction relief on April 18, 1984. Fusi’s motion\n\nalleged that the jury improperly considered his failure to testify\n\nat trial as evidence of guilt.       Atty. Chambers represented Fusi\n\nduring this first motion.        The motion was denied after a non-\n\nevidentiary hearing.\n\n           Fusi, with the assistance of new counsel, then filed a\n\nsecond motion for post-conviction relief on December 12, 1985.\n\nFusi’s new counsel argued that Fusi was entitled to a new trial on\n\nseveral   grounds,   including   ineffective    assistance   of   counsel.\n\nSpecifically, Fusi alleged that Atty. Chambers provided ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel by, inter alia, failing to interview and call\n\nprospective witnesses.     An evidentiary hearing was held and the\n\nmotion was denied.    Fusi appealed, but narrowed his allegations of\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ferror and no longer argued that Atty. Chambers provided ineffective\n\nassistance    of   counsel.      The    Massachusetts    Appeals   Court\n\nsubsequently affirmed the trial court’s denial.         See Commonwealth\n\nv. Fusi, 517 N.E. 2d 1303(1988) (Table).         Fusi appealed to the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court (“SJC”), which denied leave to purse further\n\nappellate review.      See Commonwealth v. Fusi, 519 N.E. 2d 1348\n\n(1988) (Table).\n\n              Fusi then filed a third motion for post-conviction\n\nrelief on June 1, 1989.       The third motion argued that the grand\n\njury process had been impaired and that Atty. Chambers’ failure to\n\nobject to the grand jury process constituted ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel.    Following a non-evidentiary hearing, the trial court\n\ndenied the motion.   Fusi appealed and his appeal was denied by the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court and the SJC. See Commonwealth v. Fusi,\n\n553 N.E. 2d 560 (1990) (Table); Commonwealth v. Fusi, 554 N.E. 2d\n\n1214 (1990) (Table).\n\n          Fusi’s fourth motion for post-conviction relief was filed\n\non November 17, 1995.     In the fourth motion, Fusi again alleged\n\nthat Atty. Chambers provided ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\nthis time due to his failure to object to alleged sentencing\n\nerrors.   After a non-evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied\n\nFusi’s request for a new trial, but ordered a new sentencing\n\nhearing due to Atty. Chambers’ failure to adequately represent Fusi\n\nduring sentencing. Following the new sentencing hearing, the trial\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fcourt reimposed the original sentence.           Fusi appealed, but the\n\nappeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute.\n\n          On March 3, 2003, Fusi filed his fifth motion for post-\n\nconviction relief asserting several grounds, including ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.     With his motion, Fusi provided the trial\n\ncourt with an affidavit from now-disbarred Atty. Chambers in which\n\nAtty. Chambers admitted that (1) he received Fusi’s case two days\n\nprior to trial and (2) he visited the crime scene, but never spoke\n\nwith Leonard and Cathleen Bartolo, whose backyard was the crime\n\nscene and who Fusi stated would contradict some of the victim’s\n\ntestimony concerning the light in the Bartolos’s backyard and\n\nwhether she screamed on the night of the rape.           Relying on Atty.\n\nChambers’ affidavit and affidavits from his mother and sister, Fusi\n\nargued that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to the\n\neffective assistance of counsel because Atty. Chambers did not\n\nadequately prepare for trial.\n\n          The trial court denied Fusi’s motion.          Fusi appealed to\n\nthe   Massachusetts    Appeals      Court,   which   found   no   “manifest\n\ninjustice”   and   affirmed   the    trial   court’s   ruling.     Fusi   v.\n\nCommonwealth, 854 N.E. 2d 1266, *1-2 (2006) (Table).               The SJC\n\nsubsequently denied Fusi’s Application for Leave to Obtain Further\n\nAppellate Review (“ALOFAR”).         Commonwealth v. Fusi, 857 N.E. 2d\n\n1094 (2006) (Table).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f               Fusi continued his quest for a constitutional remedy by\n\nfiling a habeas petition in federal district court. To support his\n\nhabeas petition, Fusi requested an evidentiary hearing.                               In the\n\nmotion for an evidentiary hearing, Fusi argued that because Atty.\n\nChambers completely failed to prepare for trial a presumption of\n\nprejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel was warranted.\n\n               After hearing oral arguments on the motion, the district\n\ncourt issued an order denying both the request for an evidentiary\n\nhearing and the habeas petition.                  Fusi, 588 F. Supp. 2d at 165-66.\n\nThe    district          court    implicitly      denied     Fusi’s       request     for     a\n\npresumption of prejudice and held that Fusi’s allegations, even if\n\naccepted as true, created at best a “close call” on the issue of\n\nprejudice.          Id.          The   district     court    then    held    that     Fusi’s\n\nallegations         “do    not     overcome    the   deference          afforded    by    [the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act] to the state courts’\n\ndetermination that he failed to establish prejudicial ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.”                Id. at 166.       Accordingly, Fusi was not\n\nentitled to either an evidentiary hearing or a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus.    Id.\n\n               In    response,         Fusi    applied      for     a     Certificate         of\n\nAppealability.            In the application, Fusi, relying primarily on the\n\nSixth   Circuit’s          decision     in    Mitchell      v.    Mason,    325    F.3d     723\n\n(6th    Cir.    2003),       again      asserted     that    he    was     entitled      to   a\n\npresumption         of    prejudicial        ineffective     assistance       of    counsel\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fbecause of Atty. Chambers’ alleged failure to prepare for trial.\n\nThe district court granted the Certificate of Appealability, Fusi\n\nv. O’Brien, 626 F. Supp. 2d 135 (D. Mass. 2009), and this appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                     II.\n            The critical issue on appeal is whether Fusi fully\n\nexhausted his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in state\n\ncourt. In order to promote principles of comity and federalism, “a\n\nfederal court will not entertain an application for habeas relief\n\nunless the petitioner first has fully exhausted his state remedies\n\nin   respect    to    each   and   every   claim   contained   within    the\n\napplication.”        Adelson v. DiPaola, 131 F.3d 259, 261 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).   The doctrine of exhaustion traces its origins to the 19th\n\ncentury, Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 251 (1886), and was\n\ncodified by Congress in 1948, 62 Stat. 967.\n\n            The Supreme Court has explicated that “[t]he exhaustion\n\ndoctrine is principally designed to protect the state courts’ role\n\nin the enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state\n\njudicial proceedings.”       Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518 (1982).\n\nGiven their co-equal status in our federal structure, the doctrine\n\nensures that state courts are afforded an adequate opportunity to\n\nadjudicate      constitutional      claims     properly    within       their\n\njurisdiction.    See Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204 (1950).          The\n\ndoctrine also finds support in a “pragmatic recognition that\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f‘federal claims that have been fully exhausted in state courts will\n\nmore often be accompanied by a complete factual record to aid the\n\nfederal courts in their review.’” Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S.\n\n346, 349 (1989) (quoting Rose, 455 U.S. at 519).\n\n            In the First Circuit, “a habeas petitioner bears a heavy\n\nburden to show that he fairly and recognizably presented to the\n\nstate courts the factual and legal bases of [his] federal claim.”\n\nAdelson, 131 F.3d at 261 (alterations added); Scarpa v. Dubois, 38\n\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994).          The petitioner’s ALOFAR is the\n\n“decisive pleading” and the federal claim must be presented to the\n\nstate’s highest court within the four corners of the ALOFAR.\n\nAdelson, 131 F.3d at 263; Mele v. Fitchburg Dist. Court, 850 F.2d\n\n817, 823 (1st Cir. 1988).      Earlier state court filings, however,\n\nprovide a “backdrop” against which the ALOFAR can be read if it is\n\nambiguous. See Clements v. Maloney, 485 F.3d 158, 163-64 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            Before the district court, Fusi argued that he was\n\nentitled to a writ of habeas corpus because he was denied the\n\neffective    assistance   of   counsel   in   violation   of   the   Sixth\n\nAmendment.    In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the\n\nSupreme Court established the standard test for determining whether\n\na defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated. Under\n\nthe Strickland test, a defendant must demonstrate that “counsel’s\n\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness”\n\n                                   -9-\n\fand   “a    reasonable       probability      that,     but    for        counsel’s\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.”      Id. at 688, 694.    On the same day that Strickland was\n\nissued,    the    Supreme    Court   issued    United    States      v.    Cronic,\n\n466 U.S. 648 (1984), another case concerning the scope of the Sixth\n\nAmendment’s right to counsel.         In Cronic, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat there are “circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the\n\naccused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular\n\ncase is unjustified.” Id. at 658. In these limited circumstances,\n\nprejudice   is    presumed    “without   inquiry      into    counsel’s      actual\n\nperformance at trial.”       Id. at 662.\n\n            While both Cronic and Strickland concern Sixth Amendment\n\nviolations, they are distinct legal claims and the difference\n\nbetween the two “is not of degree but of kind.”                  Bell v. Cone,\n\n535 U.S. 685, 697 (2002).            Strickland requires a case-by-case\n\nanalysis of whether counsel’s deficiencies affected the outcome of\n\na trial, while Cronic permits a presumption of prejudice if an\n\nactual or constructive denial of counsel occurs during a critical\n\nstage of the trial.      These claims, while based on similar factual\n\nunderpinnings, are separate and distinct.             A defendant’s reliance\n\non one theory in state court does not exhaust the other.                       See\n\nHuntley v. McGrath, 261 F. App’x. 4, 6 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding\n\nCronic claim unexhausted when defendant only raised Strickland\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fclaim in state courts); Higgins v. Cain, No. 09-2330, 2010 WL\n\n1855870, *6-7 (E.D. La. Feb. 8, 2010) (same).\n\n          In   his   habeas    petition,   Fusi   argued   that   a   Cronic\n\npresumption of prejudice was warranted because Atty. Chambers’\n\nfailure to prepare adequately for trial effectively denied Fusi any\n\ncounsel during the critical, pre-trial stage of the criminal\n\nproceeding. See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659 (identifying the “complete\n\ndenial of counsel” as a circumstance warranting the presumption of\n\nprejudice).    For support, Fusi relied primarily on Mitchell v.\n\nMason, a case in which the Sixth Circuit held that an attorney’s\n\ncomplete failure to prepare for trial should be analyzed under\n\nCronic, not Strickland.       See Mitchell, 325 F.3d at 748.\n\n          The relevant question on appeal is whether Fusi presented\n\nto the SJC his argument that Cronic, not Strickland, applies to his\n\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A close examination of\n\nFusi’s ALOFAR reveals not a single citation to Cronic or the Sixth\n\nCircuit’s decision in Mitchell v. Mason.            Instead, the ALOFAR\n\nrelies exclusively upon the standard two-prong Strickland test,\n\nspecifically citing that Supreme Court case five times. Instead of\n\narguing for a presumption of prejudice, the ALOFAR argues at length\n\nthat Atty. Chambers’ deficient assistance caused actual prejudice.\n\nAt no point does the ALOFAR argue or even imply that Fusi was\n\nentitled to a presumption of prejudice. Accordingly, the “decisive\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fpleading” in this appeal establishes that Fusi did not raise his\n\nCronic claim in state court.\n\n          Moreover, Fusi’s previous state court filings also did\n\nnot raise his Cronic claim.        In his brief to the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court, Fusi relied exclusively on Strickland’s two-prong\n\ntest.   Indeed,     the   brief   specifically    mentions   Strickland’s\n\nprejudice prong and argues that Atty. Chambers caused actual\n\nprejudice.   Additionally, in his initial brief to the trial court,\n\nFusi again relied exclusively on Strickland, quoted the case at\n\nlength throughout the brief, and argued that Atty. Chambers caused\n\nactual prejudice.   While we find no ambiguity in the ALOFAR, to the\n\nextent any did exist, the backdrop against which we read the ALOFAR\n\nbolsters our conclusion that Fusi did not raise his Cronic claim in\n\nstate court.\n\n          At most, Fusi’s state court filings establish the factual\n\npredicate for his Cronic claim, “[b]ut setting forth the factual\n\nunderpinnings of a claim is insufficient, in and of itself, to\n\nconstitute fair presentment of that claim.           A habeas petitioner\n\nmust also elucidate the legal foundation of his federal claim.”\n\nAdelson, 131 F.3d at 262.         Fusi failed to elucidate any legal\n\nfoundation for his Cronic claim in state court.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, Fusi failed to exhaust fully\n\nhis Cronic claim before the state court.         Thus, the district court\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fshould have dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nwithout prejudice.\n\n                                   III.\n\n          Fusi’s failure to rely upon Cronic in state court is\n\nfatal to his habeas petition.         Had Fusi exhausted his claim,\n\nhowever, he would still face a rocky slope on his constitutionally\n\npremised appeal given this circuit’s hesitance to apply Cronic’s\n\npresumption of prejudice to situations of “bad lawyering.”            See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Theodore, 468 F.3d 52, 56-58 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 13.       This circuit has made clear that\n\n“seldom [do] circumstances arise that justify a court in presuming\n\nprejudice (and, concomitantly, in forgoing particularized inquiry\n\ninto whether a denial of counsel undermined the reliability of a\n\njudgment).”     Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636, 643 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).   With respect to an incompetent attorney, the attorney’s\n\nincompetence must rise to the level of a complete denial of\n\ncounsel; “bad lawyering, regardless of how bad” is insufficient.\n\nScarpa, 38 F.3d at 13 (quoting McInerney v. Puckett, 919 F.2d 350,\n\n352-53 (5th Cir. 1990)).\n\n          Supreme Court precedent dictates our narrow application\n\nof the Cronic presumption of prejudice.           In Cronic, the Court\n\nidentified     three   specific   circumstances    that   warranted    the\n\npresumption.     See 466 U.S. at 659-662.         The first   and “most\n\nobvious” is a “complete denial of counsel . . . at a critical\n\n                                   -13-\n\fstage.”   Id. at 659.      The second occurs “if counsel entirely fails\n\nto   subject    the    prosecution’s   case   to   meaningful   adversarial\n\ntesting.”      Id.    And, the third occurs when the circumstances are\n\nsuch that “even a fully competent [attorney], could [not] provide\n\neffective assistance of counsel.”          Id. at 659-60.      Circumstances\n\nfalling into the third category include the appointment of counsel\n\n“so close upon trial as to amount to a denial of effective and\n\nsubstantial aid.”       Id. at 660 (quoting Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S.\n\n45, 53 (1932)).\n\n            Turning to the merits of Cronic’s petition, the Court\n\nheld that the circumstances surrounding his conviction did not\n\nwarrant a presumption of prejudice.        Id. at 666. The Court refused\n\nto presume prejudice despite the fact that the charged offense was\n\na complicated mail fraud scheme and the defense attorney was\n\nappointed twenty-five days prior to trial, had no criminal law\n\nexperience, and never tried a jury case before.          Id.    According to\n\nthe Court, these facts “are relevant to an evaluation of a lawyer’s\n\neffectiveness in a particular case, but neither separately nor in\n\ncombination do they provide a basis for” presuming prejudice.           Id.\n\nat 663.\n\n            Since issuing Cronic, the Supreme Court has consistently\n\ndeclined invitations to interpret the case expansively. In Bell v.\n\nCone, the defense attorney, during sentencing in a capital case,\n\nestablished that the defendant was a war veteran who received the\n\n                                    -14-\n\fBronze   Star   and    potentially     suffered   from   Vietnam    Veterans\n\nSyndrome.    See 535 U.S. at 691-92.         The defense attorney also\n\nsuccessfully    objected    to   the    introduction     of   the   victims’\n\nphotographs, but “he did not interview witnesses aside from those\n\nrelevant to the guilt phase; he did not present testimony relevant\n\nto mitigation from the witnesses who were available; and he made no\n\nplea for [the defendant’s] life or closing remarks after the\n\nState’s.”    Id. at 708 (Stevens, J., dissenting).            Despite these\n\nfailings, the Court held that the defendant was not entitled to a\n\npresumption of prejudice because the attorney did not entirely fail\n\nto subject the prosecution’s case to adversarial testing.            See id.\n\nat 697 (majority op.).\n\n            Two years later, in Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 178\n\n(2004), the Supreme Court again refused to presume prejudice. This\n\ntime the defense counsel conceded the defendant’s guilt during\n\ntrial without the defendant’s express consent.            In holding that\n\nsuch conduct did not warrant a presumption of prejudice, the Court\n\ndescribed Cronic as a “narrow exception” to Strickland that should\n\nbe applied “infrequently.”       Id. at 190.\n\n            Following the Supreme Court’s instructions, this circuit\n\nhas been reluctant to apply Cronic broadly.         Importantly, we have\n\nnot presumed prejudice in situations strikingly similar to the one\n\nbefore us today.      For example, in Scarpa, we considered whether to\n\napply the Cronic presumption to a situation where the defense\n\n                                     -15-\n\fattorney       did    not     attempt   to     impeach       government        witnesses,\n\neffectively conceded the disputed elements of the charged crimes,\n\nand    whose    closing      argument    solicited        the   jury    to     accept   the\n\ngovernment’s testimony. 38 F.3d at 9-11. We described the defense\n\nattorney’s legal theory as “half-baked” and his blunders as “not\n\nonly    fail[ing]       to    assist    in   fashioning         a    defense    but     also\n\ncement[ing] the prosecution’s theory of the case.”                       Id. at 10-11.\n\nWe therefore concluded that the defense attorney’s conduct fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.                       Id. at 11.\n\n               We    did     not,   however,       hold   that       defense    counsel’s\n\nineptitude warranted a presumption of prejudice.                             Instead, we\n\nrecognized that Cronic is a narrow exception to Strickland’s rule\n\nand should only apply to conduct “so antithetic to effective\n\nassistance . . . that a case-by-case analysis simply is not worth\n\nthe cost of protracted litigation.”                 Id. at 12.        We also explained\n\nthat “attorney error, even when egregious, will almost always\n\nrequire analysis under Strickland’s prejudice prong.”                          Id. at 14.\n\n“Put bluntly, because [defense counsel’s] errors are more an\n\nexample    of        maladroit      performance       than      of     non-performance,\n\nStrickland necessitates an inquiry into the existence of actual\n\nprejudice.”         Id. at 15.\n\n               More recently, in Theodore we were asked to apply the\n\nCronic    presumption         to    trial    counsel’s       incompetent        pre-trial\n\ninvestigation.         In Theodore, we recognized that trial counsel’s\n\n                                            -16-\n\fpre-trial investigation was “incomplete.”              468 F.3d at 55.     While\n\ntrial counsel reviewed some documents, he wholly ignored several CD\n\nROMs that contained all of the government’s evidence.                Id.   Trial\n\ncounsel also failed to interview any witnesses beyond the defendant\n\nand openly stated that he planed “to play it by ear and shoot from\n\nthe hip.”    Id.\n\n            Despite trial counsel’s woefully inadequate preparation,\n\nwe refused to presume prejudice because while the “representation\n\nof [the defendant] suffered significant shortcomings, it was not\n\ntantamount to non-representation.”             Id. at 57.         Trial counsel\n\nreviewed boxes of documents, requested copies of relevant documents\n\nfrom the government, filed pretrial motions, and exercised several\n\nperemptory challenges.        Id. at 57.      During trial, counsel cross-\n\nexamined    government      witnesses,    suggested     defense    themes,   and\n\nintroduced exhibits.        Id. at 57.    This conduct, while still below\n\nan objective level of reasonableness, “was not so deficient that\n\n[the   defendant]    should    have    been   relieved    from    demonstrating\n\nprejudice under Strickland.”          Id. at 57-58.\n\n            Like    the    attorneys     in   Scarpa    and   Theodore,    Atty.\n\nChambers’ performance may have fallen below an objective standard\n\nof reasonableness, but was not of the character as to constitute\n\nconstructive denial of counsel “justify[ing] a presumption that\n\n[the defendant’s] conviction was insufficiently reliable to satisfy\n\nthe Constitution.”        Cronic, 466 U.S. at 662.      In the affidavit that\n\n                                       -17-\n\fFusi submitted with his habeas petition, Atty. Chambers stated that\n\nprior to trial he reviewed the Commonwealth’s discovery file, the\n\nindictment,      the   grand   jury     minutes,   and    the   police    report.\n\nAtty. Chambers also stated that he interviewed Fusi’s sister and\n\nmother prior to trial, interviewed Fusi on the day of trial, and\n\nvisited the crime scene. Although Atty. Chambers received the case\n\nonly two days prior to trial and admitted he would be “shooting\n\nfrom   the    hip,”    he   provided    Fusi    with    some,   albeit   limited,\n\nrepresentation thereby precluding a presumption of prejudice under\n\nCronic.      Fusi may have retained a bad lawyer; he was not, however,\n\ndenied counsel.\n\n              We take no view as to whether Mitchell v. Mason was\n\ncorrectly decided.          We do note, however, that the Sixth Circuit\n\nopinion does not dissuade us from our present conclusion.                      In\n\nMitchell, the defense counsel in a capital case met with the\n\ndefendant for only six minutes spread over three meetings prior to\n\ntrial, failed to contact or interview known material witnesses,\n\nignored the defendant’s repeated requests for consultation, and was\n\nsuspended from the practice of law for the thirty days preceding\n\ntrial.       Id. at 744-47.      The Sixth Circuit concluded that the\n\ndefense counsel was “utterly absent” during the pre-trial stages of\n\nthe    criminal    proceeding     and    held    that    Cronic,   rather    than\n\nStrickland, should apply to the defendant’s ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel claim.       Id. at 748.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f              In this case, unlike in Mitchell, there is evidence that\n\nAtty. Chambers performed something more than a minim of work during\n\nthe     pre-trial    phase.         As    noted   above,   he   reviewed    the\n\nCommonwealth’s evidence, the indictment, the grand jury minutes,\n\nand the police report; he visited the crime scene; he met with\n\nFusi’s sister and mother; and he met with Fusi on the day of trial.\n\nThese facts distinguish this case from Mitchell in which the\n\ndefense attorney did nothing prior to trial and was not licensed to\n\npractice law the entire month preceding trial.             Unfortunately for\n\nFusi,    he    was   not   denied    counsel,     either   constructively   or\n\notherwise.      The Constitution requires representation of counsel,\n\nbut it does not mandate representation by the equal of Clarence\n\nDarrow.\n\n              Accordingly, had Fusi exhausted his Cronic claim in the\n\nstate courts, his claim would fail on its merits.\n                                         IV.\n              For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE and REMAND with\n\ninstructions to dismiss Fusi’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nwithout prejudice. Each party to bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f",

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Mass. 2008).      In his habeas petition, Fusi\n\nalleged that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective\n\nassistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to prepare\n\nfor   trial.   Because   Fusi   failed    to   exhaust   his   ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim in state court, the district court\n\nshould have dismissed his petition without prejudice.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           On February 17, 1984, Fusi was convicted in Essex County\n\nSuperior Court of rape in violation of chapter 265, section 22B of\n\nMassachusetts General Laws. Fusi was sentenced to a prison term of\n\nfifteen to twenty years.    Fusi’s sentence was to begin after he\n\nfinished serving time for a previous conviction.\n\n           The district court cogently and aptly described the\n\ncircumstances surrounding Fusi’s conviction and the performance of\n\nhis initial trial counsel, Richard Chambers, as follows:\n\n      Fusi's prosecution arose out of an incident that occurred\n      on the evening of September 11, 1981. The alleged rape\n      victim in the case described how she had gone out to two\n      bars and consumed five drinks during the evening. At\n      about 2:00 a.m., the victim had an argument with her\n      boyfriend and decided to take a walk. While walking, she\n      passed a man (18 to 20 years old) who said “Hi” as she\n      passed him. When she said “Hi” in response, he hit her\n      in the jaw, knocking her temporarily unconscious. She\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fregained consciousness in a backyard where her assailant\nwas kneeling on top of her, illuminated from some light\nsource. She screamed but the man told her he would kill\nher if she did not stop screaming and stuffed a bandana\ninto her mouth.     He proceeded to rape her and then\nimmediately left the area.\nThe victim walked out to a road where after a short time,\nshe saw a friend driving by. The friend stopped and took\nher to the police station. Although the victim reported\nthe assault, she did not make a written statement about\nthe rape at that time because she felt “out of it” and\nwanted to go to the hospital to obtain treatment for her\njaw.\nThe following day, the victim leafed through a local high\nschool yearbook to try to give her friends an idea of\nwhat her assailant looked like. She did not notice that\nFusi's photograph appeared in the yearbook four times.\nSix days later, the victim returned to the police station\nwhere the police arrayed seven photographs of men\nmatching her description of the assailant. In less than\none minute, she picked out Fusi as “the man that raped\nme”. [sic]    She also positively identified him after\nlooking at the photographs a second time. At that time\nthe victim provided the police with a six-page written\nstatement describing the rape. Approximately one month\nlater, the victim returned to the police station again\nand picked Fusi out from a nine-man line-up in less than\none minute. The victim also positively identified Fusi\nas her rapist at his trial.\nThe strategy Atty. Chambers chose to adopt at Fusi's\ntrial was one of mis-identification and alibi. To that\nend, he cross-examined the Commonwealth's witnesses,\nincluding the victim at length, focusing on the victim's\nlack of opportunity to see her assailant and on\ndiscrepancies in her description of him as compared with\nhis actual appearance, such as 1) her failure to describe\na birth-mark Fusi bears on his cheek, 2) her description\nof him as olive-skinned and Italian-looking (whereas he\nwas very pale-skinned) and 3) her statement that the\nassailant weighed considerably less than Fusi actually\nweighed.\nAtty. Chambers called several witnesses to testify about\nFusi's appearance. He also called Fusi's girlfriend of\nsix years and a friend of Fusi's to testify that on the\nevening in question they were “hanging out” at Fusi's\n\n                          -3-\n\f     home. Fusi's girlfriend testified that Fusi drove her\n     home about 1:30 a.m. Fusi's mother testified that she was\n     still awake when Fusi returned home about half an hour\n     later. She also testified that she went to bed around\n     2:20 a.m. and did not hear anyone leave the house for the\n     rest of the night. At the conclusion of the trial, the\n     judge, addressing Atty. Chambers, stated, “I appreciate\n     you worked hard”. [sic] Atty. Chambers did not, however,\n     become aware of or cross-examine the victim with respect\n     to her six-page, written statement describing the rape\n     even though that statement was available for use at trial\n     and was inconsistent with the victim's testimony in\n     several ways.\nFusi, 588 F. Supp. 2d at 160-61.\n\n           At the conclusion of the initial trial, an Essex County\n\njury found Fusi guilty of rape and his conviction was subsequently\n\naffirmed by the state appellate courts.        Fusi then filed his first\n\nmotion for post-conviction relief on April 18, 1984. Fusi’s motion\n\nalleged that the jury improperly considered his failure to testify\n\nat trial as evidence of guilt.       Atty. Chambers represented Fusi\n\nduring this first motion.        The motion was denied after a non-\n\nevidentiary hearing.\n\n           Fusi, with the assistance of new counsel, then filed a\n\nsecond motion for post-conviction relief on December 12, 1985.\n\nFusi’s new counsel argued that Fusi was entitled to a new trial on\n\nseveral   grounds,   including   ineffective    assistance   of   counsel.\n\nSpecifically, Fusi alleged that Atty. Chambers provided ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel by, inter alia, failing to interview and call\n\nprospective witnesses.     An evidentiary hearing was held and the\n\nmotion was denied.    Fusi appealed, but narrowed his allegations of\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ferror and no longer argued that Atty. Chambers provided ineffective\n\nassistance    of   counsel.      The    Massachusetts    Appeals   Court\n\nsubsequently affirmed the trial court’s denial.         See Commonwealth\n\nv. Fusi, 517 N.E. 2d 1303(1988) (Table).         Fusi appealed to the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court (“SJC”), which denied leave to purse further\n\nappellate review.      See Commonwealth v. Fusi, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1348</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1988) (Table).\n\n              Fusi then filed a third motion for post-conviction\n\nrelief on June 1, 1989.       The third motion argued that the grand\n\njury process had been impaired and that Atty. Chambers’ failure to\n\nobject to the grand jury process constituted ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel.    Following a non-evidentiary hearing, the trial court\n\ndenied the motion.   Fusi appealed and his appeal was denied by the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court and the SJC. See Commonwealth v.

In the fourth motion, Fusi again alleged\n\nthat Atty. Chambers provided ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\nthis time due to his failure to object to alleged sentencing\n\nerrors.   After a non-evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied\n\nFusi’s request for a new trial, but ordered a new sentencing\n\nhearing due to Atty. Chambers’ failure to adequately represent Fusi\n\nduring sentencing. Following the new sentencing hearing, the trial\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fcourt reimposed the original sentence.           Fusi appealed, but the\n\nappeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute.\n\n          On March 3, 2003, Fusi filed his fifth motion for post-\n\nconviction relief asserting several grounds, including ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.     With his motion, Fusi provided the trial\n\ncourt with an affidavit from now-disbarred Atty. Chambers in which\n\nAtty. Chambers admitted that (1) he received Fusi’s case two days\n\nprior to trial and (2) he visited the crime scene, but never spoke\n\nwith Leonard and Cathleen Bartolo, whose backyard was the crime\n\nscene and who Fusi stated would contradict some of the victim’s\n\ntestimony concerning the light in the Bartolos’s backyard and\n\nwhether she screamed on the night of the rape.           Relying on Atty.\n\nChambers’ affidavit and affidavits from his mother and sister, Fusi\n\nargued that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to the\n\neffective assistance of counsel because Atty. Chambers did not\n\nadequately prepare for trial.\n\n          The trial court denied Fusi’s motion.          Fusi appealed to\n\nthe   Massachusetts    Appeals      Court,   which   found   no   “manifest\n\ninjustice”   and   affirmed   the    trial   court’s   ruling.

To support his\n\nhabeas petition, Fusi requested an evidentiary hearing.                               In the\n\nmotion for an evidentiary hearing, Fusi argued that because Atty.\n\nChambers completely failed to prepare for trial a presumption of\n\nprejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel was warranted.\n\n               After hearing oral arguments on the motion, the district\n\ncourt issued an order denying both the request for an evidentiary\n\nhearing and the habeas petition.                  Fusi, 588 F. Supp. 2d at 165-66.\n\nThe    district          court    implicitly      denied     Fusi’s       request     for     a\n\npresumption of prejudice and held that Fusi’s allegations, even if\n\naccepted as true, created at best a “close call” on the issue of\n\nprejudice.          Id.          The   district     court    then    held    that     Fusi’s\n\nallegations         “do    not     overcome    the   deference          afforded    by    [the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act] to the state courts’\n\ndetermination that he failed to establish prejudicial ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.”                Id. at 166.       Accordingly, Fusi was not\n\nentitled to either an evidentiary hearing or a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus.    Id.\n\n               In    response,         Fusi    applied      for     a     Certificate         of\n\nAppealability.

In Strickland v.

Under\n\nthe Strickland test, a defendant must demonstrate that “counsel’s\n\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness”\n\n                                   -9-\n\fand   “a    reasonable       probability      that,     but    for        counsel’s\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.”      Id. at 688, 694.    On the same day that Strickland was\n\nissued,    the    Supreme    Court   issued    United    States      v.    Cronic,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111169\"><a href=\"/opinion/111169/united-states-v-cronic/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), another case concerning the scope of the Sixth\n\nAmendment’s right to counsel.         In Cronic, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat there are “circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the\n\naccused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular\n\ncase is unjustified.” Id. at 658. In these limited circumstances,\n\nprejudice   is    presumed    “without   inquiry      into    counsel’s      actual\n\nperformance at trial.”       Id. at 662.\n\n            While both Cronic and Strickland concern Sixth Amendment\n\nviolations, they are distinct legal claims and the difference\n\nbetween the two “is not of degree but of kind.”                  Bell v.

Strickland requires a case-by-case\n\nanalysis of whether counsel’s deficiencies affected the outcome of\n\na trial, while Cronic permits a presumption of prejudice if an\n\nactual or constructive denial of counsel occurs during a critical\n\nstage of the trial.      These claims, while based on similar factual\n\nunderpinnings, are separate and distinct.             A defendant’s reliance\n\non one theory in state court does not exhaust the other.                       See\n\nHuntley v. McGrath, 261 F. App’x. 4, 6 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding\n\nCronic claim unexhausted when defendant only raised Strickland\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fclaim in state courts); Higgins v. Cain, No. 09-2330, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1855870</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *6-7 (E.D. La. Feb. 8, 2010) (same).\n\n          In   his   habeas    petition,   Fusi   argued   that   a   Cronic\n\npresumption of prejudice was warranted because Atty. Chambers’\n\nfailure to prepare adequately for trial effectively denied Fusi any\n\ncounsel during the critical, pre-trial stage of the criminal\n\nproceeding. See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659 (identifying the “complete\n\ndenial of counsel” as a circumstance warranting the presumption of\n\nprejudice).    For support, Fusi relied primarily on Mitchell v.\n\nMason, a case in which the Sixth Circuit held that an attorney’s\n\ncomplete failure to prepare for trial should be analyzed under\n\nCronic, not Strickland.       See Mitchell, 325 F.3d at 748.\n\n          The relevant question on appeal is whether Fusi presented\n\nto the SJC his argument that Cronic, not Strickland, applies to his\n\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A close examination of\n\nFusi’s ALOFAR reveals not a single citation to Cronic or the Sixth\n\nCircuit’s decision in Mitchell v. Mason.            Instead, the ALOFAR\n\nrelies exclusively upon the standard two-prong Strickland test,\n\nspecifically citing that Supreme Court case five times. Instead of\n\narguing for a presumption of prejudice, the ALOFAR argues at length\n\nthat Atty. Chambers’ deficient assistance caused actual prejudice.\n\nAt no point does the ALOFAR argue or even imply that Fusi was\n\nentitled to a presumption of prejudice. Accordingly, the “decisive\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fpleading” in this appeal establishes that Fusi did not raise his\n\nCronic claim in state court.\n\n          Moreover, Fusi’s previous state court filings also did\n\nnot raise his Cronic claim.        In his brief to the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court, Fusi relied exclusively on Strickland’s two-prong\n\ntest.   Indeed,     the   brief   specifically    mentions   Strickland’s\n\nprejudice prong and argues that Atty. Chambers caused actual\n\nprejudice.   Additionally, in his initial brief to the trial court,\n\nFusi again relied exclusively on Strickland, quoted the case at\n\nlength throughout the brief, and argued that Atty. Chambers caused\n\nactual prejudice.   While we find no ambiguity in the ALOFAR, to the\n\nextent any did exist, the backdrop against which we read the ALOFAR\n\nbolsters our conclusion that Fusi did not raise his Cronic claim in\n\nstate court.\n\n          At most, Fusi’s state court filings establish the factual\n\npredicate for his Cronic claim, “[b]ut setting forth the factual\n\nunderpinnings of a claim is insufficient, in and of itself, to\n\nconstitute fair presentment of that claim.           A habeas petitioner\n\nmust also elucidate the legal foundation of his federal claim.”\n\nAdelson, 131 F.3d at 262.         Fusi failed to elucidate any legal\n\nfoundation for his Cronic claim in state court.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, Fusi failed to exhaust fully\n\nhis Cronic claim before the state court.         Thus, the district court\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fshould have dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nwithout prejudice.\n\n                                   III.\n\n          Fusi’s failure to rely upon Cronic in state court is\n\nfatal to his habeas petition.         Had Fusi exhausted his claim,\n\nhowever, he would still face a rocky slope on his constitutionally\n\npremised appeal given this circuit’s hesitance to apply Cronic’s\n\npresumption of prejudice to situations of “bad lawyering.”            See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Theodore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202500\"><a href=\"/opinion/202500/united-states-v-theodore/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56-58 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 13.       This circuit has made clear that\n\n“seldom [do] circumstances arise that justify a court in presuming\n\nprejudice (and, concomitantly, in forgoing particularized inquiry\n\ninto whether a denial of counsel undermined the reliability of a\n\njudgment).”     Ellis v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200248\"><a href=\"/opinion/200248/ellis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).   With respect to an incompetent attorney, the attorney’s\n\nincompetence must rise to the level of a complete denial of\n\ncounsel; “bad lawyering, regardless of how bad” is insufficient.\n\nScarpa, 38 F.3d at 13 (quoting McInerney v. Puckett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551846\"><a href=\"/opinion/551846/patrick-mcinerney-v-steve-w-puckett/\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n352-53 (5th Cir. 1990)).\n\n          Supreme Court precedent dictates our narrow application\n\nof the Cronic presumption of prejudice.           In Cronic, the Court\n\nidentified     three   specific   circumstances    that   warranted    the\n\npresumption.     See 466 U.S. at 659-662.         The first   and “most\n\nobvious” is a “complete denial of counsel . . . at a critical\n\n                                   -13-\n\fstage.”   Id. at 659.      The second occurs “if counsel entirely fails\n\nto   subject    the    prosecution’s   case   to   meaningful   adversarial\n\ntesting.”      Id.    And, the third occurs when the circumstances are\n\nsuch that “even a fully competent [attorney], could [not] provide\n\neffective assistance of counsel.”          Id. at 659-60.      Circumstances\n\nfalling into the third category include the appointment of counsel\n\n“so close upon trial as to amount to a denial of effective and\n\nsubstantial aid.”       Id. at 660 (quoting Powell v. Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1236300\"><a href=\"/opinion/1236300/powell-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (1932)).\n\n            Turning to the merits of Cronic’s petition, the Court\n\nheld that the circumstances surrounding his conviction did not\n\nwarrant a presumption of prejudice.        Id. at 666. The Court refused\n\nto presume prejudice despite the fact that the charged offense was\n\na complicated mail fraud scheme and the defense attorney was\n\nappointed twenty-five days prior to trial, had no criminal law\n\nexperience, and never tried a jury case before.          Id.    According to\n\nthe Court, these facts “are relevant to an evaluation of a lawyer’s\n\neffectiveness in a particular case, but neither separately nor in\n\ncombination do they provide a basis for” presuming prejudice.           Id.\n\nat 663.\n\n            Since issuing Cronic, the Supreme Court has consistently\n\ndeclined invitations to interpret the case expansively. In Bell v.\n\nCone, the defense attorney, during sentencing in a capital case,\n\nestablished that the defendant was a war veteran who received the\n\n                                    -14-\n\fBronze   Star   and    potentially     suffered   from   Vietnam    Veterans\n\nSyndrome.    See 535 U.S. at 691-92.         The defense attorney also\n\nsuccessfully    objected    to   the    introduction     of   the   victims’\n\nphotographs, but “he did not interview witnesses aside from those\n\nrelevant to the guilt phase; he did not present testimony relevant\n\nto mitigation from the witnesses who were available; and he made no\n\nplea for [the defendant’s] life or closing remarks after the\n\nState’s.”    Id. at 708 (Stevens, J., dissenting).            Despite these\n\nfailings, the Court held that the defendant was not entitled to a\n\npresumption of prejudice because the attorney did not entirely fail\n\nto subject the prosecution’s case to adversarial testing.            See id.\n\nat 697 (majority op.).\n\n            Two years later, in Florida v. Nixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137735\"><a href=\"/opinion/137735/florida-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 178\n\n(2004), the Supreme Court again refused to presume prejudice. This\n\ntime the defense counsel conceded the defendant’s guilt during\n\ntrial without the defendant’s express consent.            In holding that\n\nsuch conduct did not warrant a presumption of prejudice, the Court\n\ndescribed Cronic as a “narrow exception” to Strickland that should\n\nbe applied “infrequently.”       Id. at 190.\n\n            Following the Supreme Court’s instructions, this circuit\n\nhas been reluctant to apply Cronic broadly.         Importantly, we have\n\nnot presumed prejudice in situations strikingly similar to the one\n\nbefore us today.      For example, in Scarpa, we considered whether to\n\napply the Cronic presumption to a situation where the defense\n\n                                     -15-\n\fattorney       did    not     attempt   to     impeach       government        witnesses,\n\neffectively conceded the disputed elements of the charged crimes,\n\nand    whose    closing      argument    solicited        the   jury    to     accept   the\n\ngovernment’s testimony. 38 F.3d at 9-11. We described the defense\n\nattorney’s legal theory as “half-baked” and his blunders as “not\n\nonly    fail[ing]       to    assist    in   fashioning         a    defense    but     also\n\ncement[ing] the prosecution’s theory of the case.”                       Id. at 10-11.\n\nWe therefore concluded that the defense attorney’s conduct fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.                       Id. at 11.\n\n               We    did     not,   however,       hold   that       defense    counsel’s\n\nineptitude warranted a presumption of prejudice.                             Instead, we\n\nrecognized that Cronic is a narrow exception to Strickland’s rule\n\nand should only apply to conduct “so antithetic to effective\n\nassistance . . . that a case-by-case analysis simply is not worth\n\nthe cost of protracted litigation.”                 Id. at 12.        We also explained\n\nthat “attorney error, even when egregious, will almost always\n\nrequire analysis under Strickland’s prejudice prong.”                          Id. at 14.\n\n“Put bluntly, because [defense counsel’s] errors are more an\n\nexample    of        maladroit      performance       than      of     non-performance,\n\nStrickland necessitates an inquiry into the existence of actual\n\nprejudice.”         Id. at 15.\n\n               More recently, in Theodore we were asked to apply the\n\nCronic    presumption         to    trial    counsel’s       incompetent        pre-trial\n\ninvestigation.         In Theodore, we recognized that trial counsel’s\n\n                                            -16-\n\fpre-trial investigation was “incomplete.”              468 F.3d at 55.     While\n\ntrial counsel reviewed some documents, he wholly ignored several CD\n\nROMs that contained all of the government’s evidence.                Id.   Trial\n\ncounsel also failed to interview any witnesses beyond the defendant\n\nand openly stated that he planed “to play it by ear and shoot from\n\nthe hip.”    Id.\n\n            Despite trial counsel’s woefully inadequate preparation,\n\nwe refused to presume prejudice because while the “representation\n\nof [the defendant] suffered significant shortcomings, it was not\n\ntantamount to non-representation.”             Id. at 57.         Trial counsel\n\nreviewed boxes of documents, requested copies of relevant documents\n\nfrom the government, filed pretrial motions, and exercised several\n\nperemptory challenges.        Id. at 57.      During trial, counsel cross-\n\nexamined    government      witnesses,    suggested     defense    themes,   and\n\nintroduced exhibits.        Id. at 57.    This conduct, while still below\n\nan objective level of reasonableness, “was not so deficient that\n\n[the   defendant]    should    have    been   relieved    from    demonstrating\n\nprejudice under Strickland.”          Id. at 57-58.\n\n            Like    the    attorneys     in   Scarpa    and   Theodore,    Atty.\n\nChambers’ performance may have fallen below an objective standard\n\nof reasonableness, but was not of the character as to constitute\n\nconstructive denial of counsel “justify[ing] a presumption that\n\n[the defendant’s] conviction was insufficiently reliable to satisfy\n\nthe Constitution.”        Cronic, 466 U.S. at 662.      In the affidavit that\n\n                                       -17-\n\fFusi submitted with his habeas petition, Atty. Chambers stated that\n\nprior to trial he reviewed the Commonwealth’s discovery file, the\n\nindictment,      the   grand   jury     minutes,   and    the   police    report.\n\nAtty. Chambers also stated that he interviewed Fusi’s sister and\n\nmother prior to trial, interviewed Fusi on the day of trial, and\n\nvisited the crime scene. Although Atty. Chambers received the case\n\nonly two days prior to trial and admitted he would be “shooting\n\nfrom   the    hip,”    he   provided    Fusi    with    some,   albeit   limited,\n\nrepresentation thereby precluding a presumption of prejudice under\n\nCronic.      Fusi may have retained a bad lawyer; he was not, however,\n\ndenied counsel.\n\n              We take no view as to whether Mitchell v. Mason was\n\ncorrectly decided.          We do note, however, that the Sixth Circuit\n\nopinion does not dissuade us from our present conclusion.                      In\n\nMitchell, the defense counsel in a capital case met with the\n\ndefendant for only six minutes spread over three meetings prior to\n\ntrial, failed to contact or interview known material witnesses,\n\nignored the defendant’s repeated requests for consultation, and was\n\nsuspended from the practice of law for the thirty days preceding\n\ntrial.       Id. at 744-47.      The Sixth Circuit concluded that the\n\ndefense counsel was “utterly absent” during the pre-trial stages of\n\nthe    criminal    proceeding     and    held    that    Cronic,   rather    than\n\nStrickland, should apply to the defendant’s ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel claim.       Id. at 748.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f              In this case, unlike in Mitchell, there is evidence that\n\nAtty. Chambers performed something more than a minim of work during\n\nthe     pre-trial    phase.         As    noted   above,   he   reviewed    the\n\nCommonwealth’s evidence, the indictment, the grand jury minutes,\n\nand the police report; he visited the crime scene; he met with\n\nFusi’s sister and mother; and he met with Fusi on the day of trial.\n\nThese facts distinguish this case from Mitchell in which the\n\ndefense attorney did nothing prior to trial and was not licensed to\n\npractice law the entire month preceding trial.             Unfortunately for\n\nFusi,    he    was   not   denied    counsel,     either   constructively   or\n\notherwise.      The Constitution requires representation of counsel,\n\nbut it does not mandate representation by the equal of Clarence\n\nDarrow.\n\n              Accordingly, had Fusi exhausted his Cronic claim in the\n\nstate courts, his claim would fail on its merits.\n                                         IV.\n              For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE and REMAND with\n\ninstructions to dismiss Fusi’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nwithout prejudice. Each party to bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f</pre>",
