Nam-Krane on brief for appellant.\n     Eva M. Badway, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau,\nwith whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                            August 10, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f            BARBADORO,      District      Judge.    John    Young       was   civilly\n\ncommitted to the Massachusetts Treatment Center pursuant to Chapter\n\n123A of the Massachusetts General Laws after a state court jury\n\nfound that he was a “sexually dangerous person.”                         The jury’s\n\nverdict was affirmed on appeal in state court and Young’s habeas\n\ncorpus petition was rejected by the district court.                 He argues in\n\nthis    appeal    that    the   jury’s    verdict   violates      his    Fourteenth\n\nAmendment right to substantive due process because it authorizes\n\nhis commitment without proof that he suffers from a sufficiently\n\nserious mental impairment.\n\n                                          I.\n\n            Shortly before Young completed a state prison sentence\n\nfor a 1997 indecent assault and battery, the Commonwealth filed a\n\npetition to commit him as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to\n\nChapter 123A of the Massachusetts General Laws.\n\nA.     Chapter 123A\n\n            Massachusetts law allows for the civil commitment of a\n\nperson convicted of a sexual offense if the person “suffers from a\n\nmental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person\n\nlikely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure\n\nfacility.”       Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, § 1.            The statute explains\n\nthat a “mental abnormality” is a “congenital or acquired condition\n\nof a person that affects the emotional or volitional capacity of\n\nthe    person    in   a   manner   that    predisposes     that   person      to   the\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fcommission of criminal sexual acts to a degree that makes the\n\nperson a menace to the health and safety of other persons.”      Id.\n\nA “personality disorder” is defined as “a congenital or acquired\n\nphysical or mental condition that results in a general lack of\n\npower to control sexual impulses.”    Id.\n\n           Chapter 123A provides that the court must first conduct\n\na hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe\n\nthat an individual is a sexually dangerous person.     Id. ch. 123A,\n\n§ 12.   If probable cause exists, the individual is committed to a\n\ntreatment center “for the purpose of examination and diagnosis\n\nunder the supervision of two qualified examiners,” who file written\n\nreports with the court that include diagnoses and opinions as to\n\nwhether the individual is sexually dangerous.    Id. ch. 123A, § 13.\n\nThe individual is tried before a jury unless he affirmatively\n\nwaives that right.   Id. ch. 123A, § 14.\n\n           In Young’s case, the court followed the steps mandated by\n\nthe statute and the proceedings culminated in a jury trial.\n\nB.   The Trial\n\n           The parties stipulated that Young was eligible for civil\n\ncommitment based upon his conviction for rape in 1981 and for\n\nindecent assault and battery in 1997, both of which qualify as\n\nsexual offenses under Chapter 123A.         To meet its burden with\n\nrespect to the other elements of its commitment petition, the\n\nCommonwealth called three psychologists, Drs. Robert Joss, Barbara\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fQuiñones, and J. Leonard Peebles, each of whom opined that (1)\n\nYoung suffers from antisocial personality disorder (“APD”),1 (2)\n\nhis APD results in a general lack of power to control his sexual\n\nimpulses, and (3) his APD makes him likely to engage in sexual\n\noffenses if he is not confined to a secure facility.\n\n     1.   Difficulty Controlling Non-Sexual Impulses\n\n            All   three   experts     testified   concerning   Young’s\n\nimpulsivity, not only in order to justify their diagnoses of APD,\n\nbut also to explain how they had each reached the conclusion that\n\nYoung was a sexually dangerous person. The experts supported their\n\ntestimony by citing numerous examples drawn from reports and other\n\nrecords that documented Young’s difficulty in controlling his\n\nimpulses.\n\n            A series of reports detailed Young’s history as a child\n\nand adolescent.     According to these documents, Young’s mother\n\n     1\n       According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (“DSM-IV”), the authoritative reference used in\ndiagnosing mental disorders, an individual suffers from APD if he\nmeets four criteria.     First, he must pervasively disregard the\nrights of others, as indicated by at least three of the following:\n(1) “failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful\nbehaviors,”    (2)   “deceitfulness,”    (3)   “impulsivity,”   (4)\n“irritability and aggressiveness,” (5) “reckless disregard for\n[the] safety of self or others,” (6) “consistent irresponsibility,”\nand (7) “lack of remorse.” Second, he must be at least eighteen\nyears old.   Third, he must have exhibited symptoms of “conduct\ndisorder,” another DSM-IV disorder that is also characterized by a\nfailure to abide by social norms, beginning before the age of\nfifteen.   Finally, his antisocial behavior must not be caused\nexclusively by schizophrenia or a manic episode.           American\nPsychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental\nDisorders 706 (4th ed. text rev. 2000).\n\n                                    -4-\n\freported that he had always lacked an inner control mechanism.\n\nYoung briefly attended a Head Start program, but his behavior could\n\nnot be controlled there. From approximately the age of seven until\n\nthe age of eleven, Young attended an alternative school in Lowell.\n\nBecause of his educational needs and his aggressive outbursts, the\n\nDepartment of Public Welfare then placed Young at St. Ann’s Home,\n\na residential treatment facility in Methuen, Massachusetts, where\n\nhe lived for approximately three years. At St. Ann’s, Young pushed\n\nand   shoved    female   staff   members,   frequently   attacked   younger\n\nchildren, assaulted a staff member with a pool cue, threatened an\n\nelderly man with a knife, and was involved in a breaking and\n\nentering.      When Young visited his family, he physically assaulted\n\nhis mother and sister; his mother even reported that she feared for\n\nher life during one attack.         Eventually, the staff at St. Ann’s\n\nconcluded that they, like the staff at Head Start, could not\n\ncontain Young’s behavior.        Young was next placed in a program at\n\nthe Hayden Inn in Dorchester, Massachusetts.        There, he frequently\n\nran away, but he did not display aggressive behavior, as most of\n\nthe other residents were larger than he was.             Because officials\n\neventually determined that even the Hayden Inn program could not\n\nmeet his needs, Young was sent to the Danvers State Hospital in\n\nDanvers, Massachusetts for a ten-day observation and ultimately\n\nenrolled in the Centerpoint Residential Adolescent Program in\n\nTewksbury, Massachusetts.         At Centerpoint, Young continued his\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fviolent behavior and was involved in numerous criminal activities,\n\nincluding theft and assault.\n\n           Unsurprisingly, the three experts testified that Young’s\n\ndifficulties as a child and adolescent were significant because\n\nthey   demonstrated   his   long-standing   inability    to   control    his\n\nimpulses. Joss specifically noted that Young “had a great deal of\n\ndifficulty controlling his behavior[,] even while [he was at St.\n\nAnn’s Home,] a residential facility.”          Peebles emphasized the\n\nsignificance of the fact that multiple previous clinicians had\n\nconcluded that Young had a severe impulse control problem.\n\n           Young fared no better while incarcerated than he had in\n\nthe residential placements of his youth.       Documents relied on by\n\nJoss revealed that Young received at least 240 disciplinary reports\n\nduring   the   approximately    seventeen   years   in    which   he     was\n\nincarcerated in state prison between 1981 and February 2002.             In\n\none particularly vicious incident, Young got into a verbal argument\n\nwith corrections officers, attempted to bite one officer’s fingers,\n\nbit another officer on the forearm, causing deep puncture wounds,\n\nand told that officer, “Now you got AIDS, [be]cause I do.”              Joss\n\nand Quiñones observed that this institutional history reflected a\n\nsignificant lack of impulse control; Joss emphasized that even when\n\nhe was being watched constantly, Young could not control himself.\n\n           Young’s behavior at the Massachusetts Treatment Center in\n\nBridgewater, Massachusetts, where he was housed and treated while\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fhe awaited his civil commitment trial, also supported the experts’\n\nopinion testimony.        According to reports, in December 2002, Young\n\ndisrupted his unit by yelling to staff members, “Why don’t you\n\npieces of shit come in here so I can fuck you all up?”                On January\n\n9, 2003, while awaiting a disciplinary hearing, Young yelled, “If\n\nyou fucking people give me more time up here, just watch and see\n\nhow I act,” and he told officers he would “rip out and destroy this\n\nfucking place.”     That afternoon, he flooded his cell and told an\n\nofficer, “This [has just] begun[;] I’m going to break your neck.”\n\nThe next day, Young again flooded his cell and, when confronted by\n\nan officer, said, “This has just begun[;] I’m going to smear shit\n\nall over the walls.”        Joss and Peebles emphasized that the fact\n\nthat    Young’s    disruptive        behavior    continued     even     at     the\n\nMassachusetts Treatment Center, and in the presence of corrections\n\nofficers,   demonstrated      that    he   had   substantial   difficulty       in\n\ncontrolling his impulses.\n\n       2.   Difficulty Controlling Sexual Impulses\n\n            All   three    experts    also   testified   specifically        about\n\nYoung’s difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.\n\n            Police reports that the experts examined revealed that in\n\n1981, at the age of nineteen, Young raped a woman he had met at a\n\nbar.   After asking his victim for a ride home and directing her to\n\na secluded area, he pushed her out of her car, tore off her blouse\n\nand bra, and demanded that she remove her pants while threatening\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fher with a “magnum.”        During intercourse, the woman struggled and\n\nscreamed; Young responded by hitting her and biting her breast. In\n\n1997, while Young was on probation for armed robbery, he approached\n\na fifteen-year-old girl on the street, grabbed her shoulder to turn\n\nher around, and asked her if she wanted to party as he touched her\n\nbreasts. All three experts concluded that Young’s two prior sexual\n\noffenses were evidence of his difficulty in controlling his sexual\n\nimpulses.    Joss explained that the fact that Young committed the\n\n1997 offense while on probation, and committed the 1981 and 1997\n\ncrimes   against       people     unfamiliar    to     him,   demonstrated\n\nimpulsiveness.     In addition, Joss and Quiñones agreed that the\n\npublic location of Young’s 1997 attack underscored his lack of\n\nimpulse control.\n\n            Another set of reports from the early 1990s noted that\n\nYoung had made obscene phone calls to the wife of a corrections\n\nofficer and a J.C. Penney store while he was incarcerated.              Joss\n\nand Quiñones both testified that the phone calls demonstrated\n\nYoung’s difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.\n\n            Finally,    a    March   2002   incident    report   from    the\n\nMassachusetts Treatment Center stated that Young was found to be in\n\npossession of internet-generated, sexually explicit poems with a\n\npornographic picture on the bottom of each page, a magazine cut-out\n\ndepicting female frontal nudity, and a book with several pages\n\ndepicting male and female nudity.           Joss and Quiñones emphasized\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fthat the fact that Young had acquired sexually explicit contraband\n\neven while he was receiving sex offender treatment and awaiting his\n\ncivil commitment trial demonstrated his extreme difficulty in\n\ncontrolling his sexual impulses.\n\n     3.   The Jury Instructions and Verdict\n\n          At the conclusion of Young’s civil commitment trial, the\n\njudge instructed the jury that it could only find Young to be a\n\nsexually dangerous person if the Commonwealth had proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that (1) Young had been convicted of a sexual\n\noffense as defined by the relevant statute, (2) Young suffered from\n\na mental abnormality or personality disorder, and (3) as a result\n\nof that abnormality or disorder, Young was likely to engage in\n\nsexual offenses in the future if not confined to a secure facility.\n\nThe judge made clear that the Commonwealth was proceeding under the\n\ntheory that Young suffered from a personality disorder, and defined\n\n“personality disorder” as “a congenital or acquired physical or\n\nmental condition . . . that results in a general lack of power to\n\ncontrol sexual impulse[s].”\n\n          After deliberating, the jury found that Young was a\n\nsexually dangerous person.\n\nC.   The Appeals\n\n          Young unsuccessfully challenged the jury’s verdict in the\n\nMassachusetts Court of Appeals. See Commonwealth v. Young, No. 05-\n\nP-728, 2006 WL 1042916, at *2 (Mass. App. Ct. Apr. 20, 2006).   He\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fthen filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal\n\ndistrict court after he was denied leave to obtain further review\n\nin the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.          The district court\n\nrejected Young’s petition in a thoughtful decision but later issued\n\na certificate of appealability.\n\n                                    II.\n\n           Young bases his appeal on a series of Supreme Court\n\ndecisions that address the circumstances under which the due\n\nprocess clause permits a person to be civilly committed based in\n\npart upon a determination of future dangerousness.         See Addington\n\nv. Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1979); Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71\n\n(1992); Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997); Kansas v. Crane,\n\n534 U.S. 407 (2002).    These decisions make clear that while a state\n\nmay civilly commit a dangerous individual to protect the public in\n\ncertain circumstances, it may not use civil commitment to punish\n\npast criminal conduct, Crane, 534 U.S. at 412, to deter others from\n\nengaging in criminal behavior, id., or to confine an individual\n\nwhose dangerousness is not the product of “some additional factor,\n\nsuch as a ‘mental illness,’” Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 358; Foucha,\n\n504 U.S. at 77-79.     When a commitment decision is premised upon an\n\nindividual’s impaired volition, the court has also held that a\n\nmental   impairment   will   be   sufficient   to   distinguish   ordinary\n\nrecidivists from the dangerously mentally ill when the evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fdemonstrates that the impairment results in “serious difficulty in\n\ncontrolling behavior.”       Crane, 534 U.S. at 413.\n\n             Relying on these decisions, Young presents two related\n\nsubstantive due process claims.          First, he broadly argues that the\n\njury’s verdict cannot stand because it was based on a diagnosis of\n\nAPD, which Young claims can never serve as a sufficiently serious\n\nmental    disorder     to    justify     a    civil        commitment     decision.\n\nAlternatively, Young argues that the verdict is invalid even if APD\n\ncannot    be   categorically    excluded          as   a   predicate     for   civil\n\ncommitment because the Commonwealth failed to prove that APD\n\nmanifests itself in his case in a way that seriously impairs his\n\nability to control his sexual impulses.                We address both arguments\n\nafter    identifying   the    standard       of   review     that   we   employ    in\n\nadjudicating Young’s claim.\n\nA.   AEDPA\n\n             Under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n\nof 1996 (“AEDPA”), “the level of deference owed to a state court\n\ndecision hinges on whether the state court ever adjudicated the\n\nrelevant claim on the merits or not.”             Clements v. Clarke, 592 F.3d\n\n45, 52 (1st Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 78 U.S.L.W. 3743 (U.S. June\n\n21, 2010).      Unadjudicated claims are reviewed de novo.                        Id.\n\nDeference to the state court’s determination is warranted, however,\n\nif the court either expressly resolved the federal claim on its\n\nmerits or adjudicated it under a state law standard that “is at\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fleast as protective of the defendant’s rights as its federal\n\ncounterpart.”    Foxworth v. St. Amand, 570 F.3d 414, 426 (1st Cir.\n\n2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1710 (Mar. 1, 2010).                 Where\n\ndeferential review is employed, a writ of habeas corpus may not\n\nissue unless the adjudication either (1) “resulted in a decision\n\nthat was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n\nclearly established [f]ederal law as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt of the United States,” or (2) “resulted in a decision that\n\nwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\n\nthe evidence presented in the [s]tate court proceeding.” 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d).\n\n           Although Young acknowledged in his appellate brief that\n\nthe state court’s rulings on both of his substantive due process\n\nclaims are subject to AEDPA’s deferential standard of review, he\n\nclaimed for the first time at oral argument that his categorical\n\nclaim should be reviewed de novo because the court addressed it\n\nonly   under   state   law.   Delayed    arguments   such   as   these   are\n\nordinarily deemed to have been waived.           See, e.g., Shell Co.\n\n(P.R.), Ltd. v. Los Frailles Serv. Station, Inc., 605 F.3d 10, 19\n\n(1st Cir. 2010); United States v. Pizarro-Berrios, 448 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2006); Piazza v. Aponte Roque, 909 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).   Young presents no persuasive argument as to why we should\n\ndeviate from our established practice.         Thus, we apply AEDPA’s\n\ndeferential standard of review to both of Young’s claims.\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fB.   Categorical Claim\n\n           Young first argues that a diagnosis of APD can never\n\nserve as a sufficient basis for civil commitment because the\n\ndisorder   does   not   affect   volition   and   is   so    prevalent   among\n\ncriminal offenders that it cannot be used to distinguish ordinary\n\nrecidivists from the dangerously mentally ill.              The Massachusetts\n\nCourt of Appeals declined to adopt this argument in the abstract\n\nway in which Young presented it and instead disposed of the case by\n\nexamining the evidentiary record to determine whether sufficient\n\nevidence was produced at trial to demonstrate that Young’s APD\n\nseriously impairs his ability to control his sexual impulses.\n\nYoung, 2006 WL 1042916, at *2.         We hold that the state court’s\n\nanalytical choice represents a reasonable application of Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.\n\n           The Supreme Court has not decided whether a diagnosis of\n\nAPD can qualify by itself as a sufficiently serious impairment to\n\nsupport the civil commitment of a dangerous individual.2                   The\n\nCourt’s decisions in Hendricks and Crane, however, suggest that the\n\n\n\n     2\n       In Foucha, the court invalidated the civil commitment of a\nperson who had been diagnosed with APD in part because the statute\nunder which the commitment was ordered did not require a finding of\npresent mental illness. 504 U.S. at 78-79. As other courts have\nnoted, however, the court did not have to consider whether a\ndiagnosis of APD can ever qualify as a sufficiently serious mental\nimpairment to justify a civil commitment determination because the\nstate stipulated that Foucha was not mentally ill. See Brown v.\nWatters, 599 F.3d 602, 613 (7th Cir. 2010); Adams v. Bartow, 330\nF.3d 957, 961 (7th Cir. 2003).\n\n                                   -13-\n\fgeneral issue as to whether a particular mental disorder can serve\n\nas a sufficient basis for civil commitment ordinarily is not\n\nsusceptible to categorical analysis.             In Hendricks, the court\n\ndeclined to give “talismanic significance” to the terminology used\n\nby the psychiatric community when evaluating the constitutionality\n\nof a state statute that based commitment on a finding of “mental\n\nabnormality” rather than “mental illness.”               521 U.S. at 359.\n\nInstead, recognizing that civil commitment ultimately turns on law\n\nrather   than   psychiatry,   the     court      gave   state   legislatures\n\nsignificant latitude in specifying the circumstances under which\n\ncivil commitment will be warranted.        Id.    More recently, in Crane,\n\nthe Court endorsed a contextual approach to the determination of\n\nwhether an impairment results in serious difficulty in controlling\n\nbehavior by stating that the determination should be made “in light\n\nof such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric\n\ndiagnosis, and the severity of the mental abnormality itself\n\n. . . .”   534 U.S. at 413.    When read together, these decisions\n\nsuggest that a diagnostic label such as APD, while relevant, will\n\nrarely be dispositive in determining whether an impairment is\n\nsufficiently substantial to seriously impair volition. Instead, it\n\nis the manner in which the condition “manifests itself in the\n\nindividual” that will determine whether a particular commitment\n\ndecision meets the requirements of the due process clause.            Brown\n\nv. Watters, 599 F.3d 602, 614 (7th Cir. 2010).            Because the state\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fcourt followed this approach, it did not unreasonably apply Supreme\n\nCourt precedent when it refused to credit Young’s categorical\n\nclaim.\n\nC.   Contextual Claim\n\n                  Young alternatively challenges the jury’s verdict by\n\nclaiming that the record does not establish that APD causes him\n\nserious difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses. He supports\n\nthis argument by (1) noting that he was not found to have a\n\nparaphilia3 such as exhibitionism or pedophilia in addition to APD\n\nand (2) citing excerpts from the cross-examinations of the three\n\nexperts who testified for the Commonwealth, which arguably could be\n\nread to suggest that Young retains the capacity to control his\n\nsexual       impulses      in   certain   circumstances.          We   hold    that    the\n\nMassachusetts Court of Appeals did not unreasonably apply Supreme\n\nCourt precedent in rejecting this argument.\n\n                  Like all questions of evidentiary sufficiency, this one\n\nmust be analyzed on the basis of the record.                 Although Young claims\n\nthat       APD    cannot   affect    volition    when   it   is    unaccompanied       by\n\nparaphilia, he fails to identify any evidence in the record to\n\nsupport          this   assertion.     Instead,    he   cites     United      States   v.\n\n\n       3\n       The DSM-IV lists several types of paraphilias and explains\nthat “the essential features of a [p]araphilia are recurrent,\nintense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors\ngenerally involving 1) nonhuman objects, 2) the suffering or\nhumiliation of oneself or one’s partner, or 3) children or other\nnon[-]consenting persons that occur over a period of at least 6\nmonths . . . .” DSM-IV at 566.\n\n                                          -15-\n\fWilkinson,   646    F.    Supp.   2d    194,    205   (D.   Mass.     2009),    which\n\nrecognizes   that       the   psychiatric      community    is    divided    on   the\n\nsubject. See also Brown, 599 F.3d at 613 & n.13 (describing the\n\ndebate concerning whether APD is an appropriate predicate for civil\n\ncommitment).      Even if it were appropriate to consider judicial\n\ndecisions recognizing the current controversy in examining the\n\nstate court’s sufficiency determination — an issue we need not\n\ndecide — these cases at most suggest that experts disagree, and\n\nsuch reasonable disagreements simply are not dispositive.                      Id. at\n\n613-14. What matters here is that all three of the experts who\n\ntestified in this case were in agreement that Young’s APD causes\n\nhim serious difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.\n\n            Young’s effort to cast doubt on the experts’ opinions by\n\npointing to selected excerpts drawn from their cross-examinations\n\nis also unpersuasive.         As the record demonstrates, Young’s impulse\n\ncontrol   problems       date   back    to   childhood      and     have   continued\n\nthroughout his incarceration.           His two sexual offense convictions,\n\nas well as the evidence that he placed obscene phone calls from\n\nprison and possessed sexually explicit contraband while he was\n\nawaiting trial in the current matter, also provide substantial\n\nsupport   for     the    experts’      opinions   that      Young    continues    to\n\nexperience      substantial     difficulty      in    controlling      his     sexual\n\nimpulses.    Although the record could be read to suggest that Young\n\nis able to control those impulses in certain circumstances, the\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fSupreme Court has held that a total lack of volitional control is\n\nnot required to justify the commitment of a dangerous sex offender.\n\nCrane, 534 U.S. at 411, 413.

Badway, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges, and BARBADORO,<sup>[*]</sup> District Judge.</p>\n<p>BARBADORO, District Judge.</p>\n<p>John Young was civilly committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center pursuant to Chapter 123A of the Massachusetts General Laws after a state court jury found that he was a \"sexually dangerous person.\" The jury's verdict was affirmed on appeal in state court and Young's habeas corpus petition was rejected by the district court. He argues in this appeal that the jury's verdict violates his Fourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process because it authorizes his commitment without proof that he suffers from a sufficiently serious mental impairment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Shortly before Young completed a state prison sentence for a 1997 indecent assault and battery, the Commonwealth filed a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> petition to commit him as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to Chapter 123A of the Massachusetts General Laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Chapter 123A</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Massachusetts law allows for the civil commitment of a person convicted of a sexual offense if the person \"suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, § 1. The statute explains that a \"mental abnormality\" is a \"congenital or acquired condition of a person that affects the emotional or volitional capacity of the person in a manner that predisposes that person to the commission of criminal sexual acts to a degree that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of other persons.\" <i>Id.</i> A \"personality disorder\" is defined as \"a congenital or acquired physical or mental condition that results in a general lack of power to control sexual impulses.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Chapter 123A provides that the court must first conduct a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that an individual is a sexually dangerous person. <i>Id.</i> ch. 123A, § 12. If probable cause exists, the individual is committed to a treatment center \"for the purpose of examination and diagnosis under the supervision of two qualified examiners,\" who file written reports with the court that include diagnoses and opinions as to whether the individual is sexually dangerous. <i>Id.</i> ch. 123A, § 13. The individual is tried before a jury unless he affirmatively waives that right. <i>Id.</i> ch. 123A, § 14.</p>\n<p>In Young's case, the court followed the steps mandated by the statute and the proceedings culminated in a jury trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Trial</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The parties stipulated that Young was eligible for civil commitment based upon his conviction for rape in 1981 and for indecent assault and battery in 1997, both of which qualify as sexual offenses under Chapter 123A. To meet its burden with respect to the other elements of its commitment petition, the Commonwealth called three psychologists, Drs. Robert Joss, Barbara Quiñones, and J. Leonard Peebles, each of whom opined that (1) Young suffers from antisocial personality disorder (\"APD\"),<sup>[1]</sup> (2) his APD results in a general lack of power to control his sexual impulses, and (3) his APD makes him likely to engage in sexual offenses if he is not confined to a secure facility.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Difficulty Controlling Non-Sexual Impulses</h2>\n<p>All three experts testified concerning Young's impulsivity, not only in order to justify their diagnoses of APD, but also to explain how they had each reached the conclusion that Young was a sexually dangerous person. The experts supported their testimony by citing numerous examples <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> drawn from reports and other records that documented Young's difficulty in controlling his impulses.</p>\n<p>A series of reports detailed Young's history as a child and adolescent. According to these documents, Young's mother reported that he had always lacked an inner control mechanism. Young briefly attended a Head Start program, but his behavior could not be controlled there. From approximately the age of seven until the age of eleven, Young attended an alternative school in Lowell. Because of his educational needs and his aggressive outbursts, the Department of Public Welfare then placed Young at St. Ann's Home, a residential treatment facility in Methuen, Massachusetts, where he lived for approximately three years. At St. Ann's, Young pushed and shoved female staff members, frequently attacked younger children, assaulted a staff member with a pool cue, threatened an elderly man with a knife, and was involved in a breaking and entering. When Young visited his family, he physically assaulted his mother and sister; his mother even reported that she feared for her life during one attack. Eventually, the staff at St. Ann's concluded that they, like the staff at Head Start, could not contain Young's behavior. Young was next placed in a program at the Hayden Inn in Dorchester, Massachusetts. There, he frequently ran away, but he did not display aggressive behavior, as most of the other residents were larger than he was. Because officials eventually determined that even the Hayden Inn program could not meet his needs, Young was sent to the Danvers State Hospital in Danvers, Massachusetts for a ten-day observation and ultimately enrolled in the Centerpoint Residential Adolescent Program in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. At Centerpoint, Young continued his violent behavior and was involved in numerous criminal activities, including theft and assault.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the three experts testified that Young's difficulties as a child and adolescent were significant because they demonstrated his long-standing inability to control his impulses. Joss specifically noted that Young \"had a great deal of difficulty controlling his behavior[,] even while [he was at St. Ann's Home,] a residential facility.\" Peebles emphasized the significance of the fact that multiple previous clinicians had concluded that Young had a severe impulse control problem.</p>\n<p>Young fared no better while incarcerated than he had in the residential placements of his youth. Documents relied on by Joss revealed that Young received at least 240 disciplinary reports during the approximately seventeen years in which he was incarcerated in state prison between 1981 and February 2002. In one particularly vicious incident, Young got into a verbal argument with corrections officers, attempted to bite one officer's fingers, bit another officer on the forearm, causing deep puncture wounds, and told that officer, \"Now you got AIDS, [be]cause I do.\" Joss and Quiñones observed that this institutional history reflected a significant lack of impulse control; Joss emphasized that even when he was being watched constantly, Young could not control himself.</p>\n<p>Young's behavior at the Massachusetts Treatment Center in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, where he was housed and treated while he awaited his civil commitment trial, also supported the experts' opinion testimony. According to reports, in December 2002, Young disrupted his unit by yelling to staff members, \"Why don't you pieces of shit come in here so I can fuck you all up?\" On January 9, 2003, while awaiting a disciplinary hearing, Young yelled, \"If you fucking people give me more time up here, just watch and see how I act,\" and he told officers he would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> \"rip out and destroy this fucking place.\" That afternoon, he flooded his cell and told an officer, \"This [has just] begun[;] I'm going to break your neck.\" The next day, Young again flooded his cell and, when confronted by an officer, said, \"This has just begun[;] I'm going to smear shit all over the walls.\" Joss and Peebles emphasized that the fact that Young's disruptive behavior continued even at the Massachusetts Treatment Center, and in the presence of corrections officers, demonstrated that he had substantial difficulty in controlling his impulses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Difficulty Controlling Sexual Impulses</h2>\n<p>All three experts also testified specifically about Young's difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.</p>\n<p>Police reports that the experts examined revealed that in 1981, at the age of nineteen, Young raped a woman he had met at a bar. After asking his victim for a ride home and directing her to a secluded area, he pushed her out of her car, tore off her blouse and bra, and demanded that she remove her pants while threatening her with a \"magnum.\" During intercourse, the woman struggled and screamed; Young responded by hitting her and biting her breast. In 1997, while Young was on probation for armed robbery, he approached a fifteen-year-old girl on the street, grabbed her shoulder to turn her around, and asked her if she wanted to party as he touched her breasts. All three experts concluded that Young's two prior sexual offenses were evidence of his difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses. Joss explained that the fact that Young committed the 1997 offense while on probation, and committed the 1981 and 1997 crimes against people unfamiliar to him, demonstrated impulsiveness. In addition, Joss and Quiñones agreed that the public location of Young's 1997 attack underscored his lack of impulse control.</p>\n<p>Another set of reports from the early 1990s noted that Young had made obscene phone calls to the wife of a corrections officer and a J.C. Penney store while he was incarcerated. Joss and Quiñones both testified that the phone calls demonstrated Young's difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.</p>\n<p>Finally, a March 2002 incident report from the Massachusetts Treatment Center stated that Young was found to be in possession of internet-generated, sexually explicit poems with a pornographic picture on the bottom of each page, a magazine cut-out depicting female frontal nudity, and a book with several pages depicting male and female nudity. Joss and Quiñones emphasized that the fact that Young had acquired sexually explicit contraband even while he was receiving sex offender treatment and awaiting his civil commitment trial demonstrated his extreme difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The Jury Instructions and Verdict</h2>\n<p>At the conclusion of Young's civil commitment trial, the judge instructed the jury that it could only find Young to be a sexually dangerous person if the Commonwealth had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) Young had been convicted of a sexual offense as defined by the relevant statute, (2) Young suffered from a mental abnormality or personality disorder, and (3) as a result of that abnormality or disorder, Young was likely to engage in sexual offenses in the future if not confined to a secure facility. The judge made clear that the Commonwealth was proceeding under the theory that Young suffered from a personality disorder, and defined \"personality disorder\" as \"a congenital or acquired physical or mental condition ... that results <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> in a general lack of power to control sexual impulse[s].\"</p>\n<p>After deliberating, the jury found that Young was a sexually dangerous person.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Appeals</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Young unsuccessfully challenged the jury's verdict in the Massachusetts Court of Appeals. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Young,</i> 66 Mass.App.Ct. 1103, 845 N.E.2d 1223, 2006 WL 1042916, at *2 (Mass.App.Ct. Apr. 20, 2006). He then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court after he was denied leave to obtain further review in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The district court rejected Young's petition in a thoughtful decision but later issued a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Young bases his appeal on a series of Supreme Court decisions that address the circumstances under which the due process clause permits a person to be civilly committed based in part upon a determination of future dangerousness. <i>See </i><i>Addington v. Texas,</i> 441 U.S. 418, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979); <i>Foucha v. Louisiana,</i> 504 U.S. 71, 112 S.Ct. 1780, 118 L.Ed.2d 437 (1992); <i>Kansas v. Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. 346, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997); <i>Kansas v. Crane,</i> 534 U.S. 407, 122 S.Ct. 867, 151 L.Ed.2d 856 (2002). These decisions make clear that while a state may civilly commit a dangerous individual to protect the public in certain circumstances, it may not use civil commitment to punish past criminal conduct, <i>Crane,</i> 534 U.S. at 412, 122 S.Ct. 867, to deter others from engaging in criminal behavior, <i>id.,</i> or to confine an individual whose dangerousness is not the product of \"some additional factor, such as a `mental illness,'\" <i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. at 358, 117 S.Ct. 2072; <i>Foucha,</i> 504 U.S. at 77-79, 112 S.Ct. 1780. When a commitment decision is premised upon an individual's impaired volition, the court has also held that a mental impairment will be sufficient to distinguish ordinary recidivists from the dangerously mentally ill when the evidence demonstrates that the impairment results in \"serious difficulty in controlling behavior.\" <i>Crane,</i> 534 U.S. at 413, 122 S.Ct. 867.</p>\n<p>Relying on these decisions, Young presents two related substantive due process claims. First, he broadly argues that the jury's verdict cannot stand because it was based on a diagnosis of APD, which Young claims can never serve as a sufficiently serious mental disorder to justify a civil commitment decision. Alternatively, Young argues that the verdict is invalid even if APD cannot be categorically excluded as a predicate for civil commitment because the Commonwealth failed to prove that APD manifests itself in his case in a way that seriously impairs his ability to control his sexual impulses. We address both arguments after identifying the standard of review that we employ in adjudicating Young's claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>AEDPA</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), \"the level of deference owed to a state court decision hinges on whether the state court ever adjudicated the relevant claim on the merits or not.\" <i>Clements v. Clarke,</i> 592 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2010), <i>cert. denied,</i> 130 S.Ct. 3475, ___ S.Ct. ___, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010). Unadjudicated claims are reviewed <i>de novo. Id.</i> Deference to the state court's determination is warranted, however, if the court either expressly resolved the federal claim on its merits or adjudicated it under a state law standard that \"is at least as protective of the defendant's rights as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> its federal counterpart.\" <i>Foxworth v. St. Amand,</i> 570 F.3d 414, 426 (1st Cir.2009), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1710, 176 L.Ed.2d 197 (Mar. 1, 2010). Where deferential review is employed, a writ of habeas corpus may not issue unless the adjudication either (1) \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established [f]ederal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" or (2) \"resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the [s]tate court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).</p>\n<p>Although Young acknowledged in his appellate brief that the state court's rulings on both of his substantive due process claims are subject to AEDPA's deferential standard of review, he claimed for the first time at oral argument that his categorical claim should be reviewed <i>de novo</i> because the court addressed it only under state law. Delayed arguments such as these are ordinarily deemed to have been waived. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Shell Co. (P.R.), Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc.,</i> 605 F.3d 10, 19 (1st Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Pizarro-Berrios,</i> 448 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Piazza v. Aponte Roque,</i> 909 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir.1990). Young presents no persuasive argument as to why we should deviate from our established practice. Thus, we apply AEDPA's deferential standard of review to both of Young's claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Categorical Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Young first argues that a diagnosis of APD can never serve as a sufficient basis for civil commitment because the disorder does not affect volition and is so prevalent among criminal offenders that it cannot be used to distinguish ordinary recidivists from the dangerously mentally ill. The Massachusetts Court of Appeals declined to adopt this argument in the abstract way in which Young presented it and instead disposed of the case by examining the evidentiary record to determine whether sufficient evidence was produced at trial to demonstrate that Young's APD seriously impairs his ability to control his sexual impulses. <i>Young,</i> 2006 WL 1042916, at *2. We hold that the state court's analytical choice represents a reasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has not decided whether a diagnosis of APD can qualify by itself as a sufficiently serious impairment to support the civil commitment of a dangerous individual.<sup>[2]</sup> The Court's decisions in <i>Hendricks</i> and <i>Crane,</i> however, suggest that the general issue as to whether a particular mental disorder can serve as a sufficient basis for civil commitment ordinarily is not susceptible to categorical analysis. In <i>Hendricks,</i> the court declined to give \"talismanic significance\" to the terminology used by the psychiatric community when evaluating the constitutionality of a state statute that based commitment on a finding of \"mental abnormality\" rather than \"mental illness.\" 521 U.S. at 359, 117 S.Ct. 2072. Instead, recognizing that civil commitment ultimately turns on law rather than psychiatry, the court gave <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> state legislatures significant latitude in specifying the circumstances under which civil commitment will be warranted. <i>Id.</i> More recently, in <i>Crane,</i> the Court endorsed a contextual approach to the determination of whether an impairment results in serious difficulty in controlling behavior by stating that the determination should be made \"in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis, and the severity of the mental abnormality itself....\" 534 U.S. at 413, 122 S.Ct. 867. When read together, these decisions suggest that a diagnostic label such as APD, while relevant, will rarely be dispositive in determining whether an impairment is sufficiently substantial to seriously impair volition. Instead, it is the manner in which the condition \"manifests itself in the individual\" that will determine whether a particular commitment decision meets the requirements of the due process clause. <i>Brown v. Watters,</i> 599 F.3d 602, 614 (7th Cir.2010). Because the state court followed this approach, it did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court precedent when it refused to credit Young's categorical claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Contextual Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Young alternatively challenges the jury's verdict by claiming that the record does not establish that APD causes him serious difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses. He supports this argument by (1) noting that he was not found to have a paraphilia<sup>[3]</sup> such as exhibitionism or pedophilia in addition to APD and (2) citing excerpts from the cross-examinations of the three experts who testified for the Commonwealth, which arguably could be read to suggest that Young retains the capacity to control his sexual impulses in certain circumstances. We hold that the Massachusetts Court of Appeals did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court precedent in rejecting this argument.</p>\n<p>Like all questions of evidentiary sufficiency, this one must be analyzed on the basis of the record. Although Young claims that APD cannot affect volition when it is unaccompanied by paraphilia, he fails to identify any evidence in the record to support this assertion. Instead, he cites <i>United States v. Wilkinson,</i> 646 F.Supp.2d 194, 205 (D.Mass.2009), which recognizes that the psychiatric community is divided on the subject. <i>See also </i><i>Brown,</i> 599 F.3d at 613 &amp; n. 13 (describing the debate concerning whether APD is an appropriate predicate for civil commitment). Even if it were appropriate to consider judicial decisions recognizing the current controversy in examining the state court's sufficiency determinationan issue we need not decidethese cases at most suggest that experts disagree, and such reasonable disagreements simply are not dispositive. <i>Id.</i> at 613-14. What matters here is that all three of the experts who testified in this case were in agreement that Young's APD causes him serious difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.</p>\n<p>Young's effort to cast doubt on the experts' opinions by pointing to selected excerpts drawn from their cross-examinations is also unpersuasive. As the record demonstrates, Young's impulse control problems date back to childhood and have continued throughout his incarceration. His two sexual offense convictions, as well as the evidence that he placed obscene phone calls from prison and possessed sexually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> explicit contraband while he was awaiting trial in the current matter, also provide substantial support for the experts' opinions that Young continues to experience substantial difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses. Although the record could be read to suggest that Young is able to control those impulses in certain circumstances, the Supreme Court has held that a total lack of volitional control is not required to justify the commitment of a dangerous sex offender. <i>Crane,</i> 534 U.S. at 411, 413, 122 S.Ct. 867. Accordingly, the state court did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court precedent when it determined that Young suffered from a sufficiently serious mental impairment to warrant his civil commitment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The district court's decision denying Young's petition for habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"DSM-IV\"), the authoritative reference used in diagnosing mental disorders, an individual suffers from APD if he meets four criteria. First, he must pervasively disregard the rights of others, as indicated by at least three of the following: (1) \"failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors,\" (2) \"deceitfulness,\" (3) \"impulsivity,\" (4) \"irritability and aggressiveness,\" (5) \"reckless disregard for [the] safety of self or others,\" (6) \"consistent irresponsibility,\" and (7) \"lack of remorse.\" Second, he must be at least eighteen years old. Third, he must have exhibited symptoms of \"conduct disorder,\" another DSM-IV disorder that is also characterized by a failure to abide by social norms, beginning before the age of fifteen. Finally, his antisocial behavior must not be caused exclusively by schizophrenia or a manic episode. American Psychiatric Association, <i>Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders</i> 706 (4th ed. text rev. 2000).</p>\n<p>[2]  In <i>Foucha,</i> the court invalidated the civil commitment of a person who had been diagnosed with APD in part because the statute under which the commitment was ordered did not require a finding of present mental illness. 504 U.S. at 78-79, 112 S.Ct. 1780. As other courts have noted, however, the court did not have to consider whether a diagnosis of APD can ever qualify as a sufficiently serious mental impairment to justify a civil commitment determination because the state stipulated that Foucha was not mentally ill. <i>See </i><i>Brown v. Watters,</i> 599 F.3d 602, 613 (7th Cir.2010); <i>Adams v.

He argues in this appeal that the jury's verdict violates his Fourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process because it authorizes his commitment without proof that he suffers from a sufficiently serious mental impairment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Shortly before Young completed a state prison sentence for a 1997 indecent assault and battery, the Commonwealth filed a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> petition to commit him as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to Chapter 123A of the Massachusetts General Laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Chapter 123A</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Massachusetts law allows for the civil commitment of a person convicted of a sexual offense if the person \"suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, § 1. The statute explains that a \"mental abnormality\" is a \"congenital or acquired condition of a person that affects the emotional or volitional capacity of the person in a manner that predisposes that person to the commission of criminal sexual acts to a degree that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of other persons.\" <i>Id.</i> A \"personality disorder\" is defined as \"a congenital or acquired physical or mental condition that results in a general lack of power to control sexual impulses.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Chapter 123A provides that the court must first conduct a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that an individual is a sexually dangerous person. <i>Id.</i> ch. 123A, § 12. If probable cause exists, the individual is committed to a treatment center \"for the purpose of examination and diagnosis under the supervision of two qualified examiners,\" who file written reports with the court that include diagnoses and opinions as to whether the individual is sexually dangerous. <i>Id.</i> ch. 123A, § 13. The individual is tried before a jury unless he affirmatively waives that right. <i>Id.</i> ch. 123A, § 14.</p>\n<p>In Young's case, the court followed the steps mandated by the statute and the proceedings culminated in a jury trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Trial</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The parties stipulated that Young was eligible for civil commitment based upon his conviction for rape in 1981 and for indecent assault and battery in 1997, both of which qualify as sexual offenses under Chapter 123A. To meet its burden with respect to the other elements of its commitment petition, the Commonwealth called three psychologists, Drs. Robert Joss, Barbara Quiñones, and J. Leonard Peebles, each of whom opined that (1) Young suffers from antisocial personality disorder (\"APD\"),<sup>[1]</sup> (2) his APD results in a general lack of power to control his sexual impulses, and (3) his APD makes him likely to engage in sexual offenses if he is not confined to a secure facility.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Difficulty Controlling Non-Sexual Impulses</h2>\n<p>All three experts testified concerning Young's impulsivity, not only in order to justify their diagnoses of APD, but also to explain how they had each reached the conclusion that Young was a sexually dangerous person. The experts supported their testimony by citing numerous examples <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> drawn from reports and other records that documented Young's difficulty in controlling his impulses.</p>\n<p>A series of reports detailed Young's history as a child and adolescent. According to these documents, Young's mother reported that he had always lacked an inner control mechanism. Young briefly attended a Head Start program, but his behavior could not be controlled there. From approximately the age of seven until the age of eleven, Young attended an alternative school in Lowell. Because of his educational needs and his aggressive outbursts, the Department of Public Welfare then placed Young at St. Ann's Home, a residential treatment facility in Methuen, Massachusetts, where he lived for approximately three years. At St. Ann's, Young pushed and shoved female staff members, frequently attacked younger children, assaulted a staff member with a pool cue, threatened an elderly man with a knife, and was involved in a breaking and entering. When Young visited his family, he physically assaulted his mother and sister; his mother even reported that she feared for her life during one attack. Eventually, the staff at St. Ann's concluded that they, like the staff at Head Start, could not contain Young's behavior. Young was next placed in a program at the Hayden Inn in Dorchester, Massachusetts. There, he frequently ran away, but he did not display aggressive behavior, as most of the other residents were larger than he was. Because officials eventually determined that even the Hayden Inn program could not meet his needs, Young was sent to the Danvers State Hospital in Danvers, Massachusetts for a ten-day observation and ultimately enrolled in the Centerpoint Residential Adolescent Program in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. At Centerpoint, Young continued his violent behavior and was involved in numerous criminal activities, including theft and assault.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the three experts testified that Young's difficulties as a child and adolescent were significant because they demonstrated his long-standing inability to control his impulses. Joss specifically noted that Young \"had a great deal of difficulty controlling his behavior[,] even while [he was at St. Ann's Home,] a residential facility.\" Peebles emphasized the significance of the fact that multiple previous clinicians had concluded that Young had a severe impulse control problem.</p>\n<p>Young fared no better while incarcerated than he had in the residential placements of his youth. Documents relied on by Joss revealed that Young received at least 240 disciplinary reports during the approximately seventeen years in which he was incarcerated in state prison between 1981 and February 2002. In one particularly vicious incident, Young got into a verbal argument with corrections officers, attempted to bite one officer's fingers, bit another officer on the forearm, causing deep puncture wounds, and told that officer, \"Now you got AIDS, [be]cause I do.\" Joss and Quiñones observed that this institutional history reflected a significant lack of impulse control; Joss emphasized that even when he was being watched constantly, Young could not control himself.</p>\n<p>Young's behavior at the Massachusetts Treatment Center in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, where he was housed and treated while he awaited his civil commitment trial, also supported the experts' opinion testimony. According to reports, in December 2002, Young disrupted his unit by yelling to staff members, \"Why don't you pieces of shit come in here so I can fuck you all up?\" On January 9, 2003, while awaiting a disciplinary hearing, Young yelled, \"If you fucking people give me more time up here, just watch and see how I act,\" and he told officers he would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> \"rip out and destroy this fucking place.\" That afternoon, he flooded his cell and told an officer, \"This [has just] begun[;] I'm going to break your neck.\" The next day, Young again flooded his cell and, when confronted by an officer, said, \"This has just begun[;] I'm going to smear shit all over the walls.\" Joss and Peebles emphasized that the fact that Young's disruptive behavior continued even at the Massachusetts Treatment Center, and in the presence of corrections officers, demonstrated that he had substantial difficulty in controlling his impulses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Difficulty Controlling Sexual Impulses</h2>\n<p>All three experts also testified specifically about Young's difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.</p>\n<p>Police reports that the experts examined revealed that in 1981, at the age of nineteen, Young raped a woman he had met at a bar. After asking his victim for a ride home and directing her to a secluded area, he pushed her out of her car, tore off her blouse and bra, and demanded that she remove her pants while threatening her with a \"magnum.\" During intercourse, the woman struggled and screamed; Young responded by hitting her and biting her breast. In 1997, while Young was on probation for armed robbery, he approached a fifteen-year-old girl on the street, grabbed her shoulder to turn her around, and asked her if she wanted to party as he touched her breasts. All three experts concluded that Young's two prior sexual offenses were evidence of his difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses. Joss explained that the fact that Young committed the 1997 offense while on probation, and committed the 1981 and 1997 crimes against people unfamiliar to him, demonstrated impulsiveness. In addition, Joss and Quiñones agreed that the public location of Young's 1997 attack underscored his lack of impulse control.</p>\n<p>Another set of reports from the early 1990s noted that Young had made obscene phone calls to the wife of a corrections officer and a J.C. Penney store while he was incarcerated. Joss and Quiñones both testified that the phone calls demonstrated Young's difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.</p>\n<p>Finally, a March 2002 incident report from the Massachusetts Treatment Center stated that Young was found to be in possession of internet-generated, sexually explicit poems with a pornographic picture on the bottom of each page, a magazine cut-out depicting female frontal nudity, and a book with several pages depicting male and female nudity. Joss and Quiñones emphasized that the fact that Young had acquired sexually explicit contraband even while he was receiving sex offender treatment and awaiting his civil commitment trial demonstrated his extreme difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The Jury Instructions and Verdict</h2>\n<p>At the conclusion of Young's civil commitment trial, the judge instructed the jury that it could only find Young to be a sexually dangerous person if the Commonwealth had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) Young had been convicted of a sexual offense as defined by the relevant statute, (2) Young suffered from a mental abnormality or personality disorder, and (3) as a result of that abnormality or disorder, Young was likely to engage in sexual offenses in the future if not confined to a secure facility. The judge made clear that the Commonwealth was proceeding under the theory that Young suffered from a personality disorder, and defined \"personality disorder\" as \"a congenital or acquired physical or mental condition ... that results <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> in a general lack of power to control sexual impulse[s].\"</p>\n<p>After deliberating, the jury found that Young was a sexually dangerous person.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Appeals</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Young unsuccessfully challenged the jury's verdict in the Massachusetts Court of Appeals. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Young,</i> 66 Mass.App.Ct. 1103, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1042916</span></span>, at *2 (Mass.App.Ct. Apr. 20, 2006). He then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court after he was denied leave to obtain further review in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The district court rejected Young's petition in a thoughtful decision but later issued a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Young bases his appeal on a series of Supreme Court decisions that address the circumstances under which the due process clause permits a person to be civilly committed based in part upon a determination of future dangerousness. <i>See </i><i>Addington v.

These decisions make clear that while a state may civilly commit a dangerous individual to protect the public in certain circumstances, it may not use civil commitment to punish past criminal conduct, <i>Crane,</i> 534 U.S. at 412, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118479\"><a href=\"/opinion/118479/kansas-v-crane/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1780</span></a></span>. When a commitment decision is premised upon an individual's impaired volition, the court has also held that a mental impairment will be sufficient to distinguish ordinary recidivists from the dangerously mentally ill when the evidence demonstrates that the impairment results in \"serious difficulty in controlling behavior.\" <i>Crane,</i> 534 U.S. at 413, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118479\"><a href=\"/opinion/118479/kansas-v-crane/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Relying on these decisions, Young presents two related substantive due process claims. First, he broadly argues that the jury's verdict cannot stand because it was based on a diagnosis of APD, which Young claims can never serve as a sufficiently serious mental disorder to justify a civil commitment decision. Alternatively, Young argues that the verdict is invalid even if APD cannot be categorically excluded as a predicate for civil commitment because the Commonwealth failed to prove that APD manifests itself in his case in a way that seriously impairs his ability to control his sexual impulses. We address both arguments after identifying the standard of review that we employ in adjudicating Young's claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>AEDPA</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), \"the level of deference owed to a state court decision hinges on whether the state court ever adjudicated the relevant claim on the merits or not.\" <i>Clements v. Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204181\"><a href=\"/opinion/204181/clements-v-clarke/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir. 2010), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3475</span></span>, ___ S.Ct. ___, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010). Unadjudicated claims are reviewed <i>de novo. Id.</i> Deference to the state court's determination is warranted, however, if the court either expressly resolved the federal claim on its merits or adjudicated it under a state law standard that \"is at least as protective of the defendant's rights as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> its federal counterpart.\" <i>Foxworth v. St. Amand,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></span>, 426 (1st Cir.2009), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></span> (Mar. 1, 2010). Where deferential review is employed, a writ of habeas corpus may not issue unless the adjudication either (1) \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established [f]ederal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" or (2) \"resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the [s]tate court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).</p>\n<p>Although Young acknowledged in his appellate brief that the state court's rulings on both of his substantive due process claims are subject to AEDPA's deferential standard of review, he claimed for the first time at oral argument that his categorical claim should be reviewed <i>de novo</i> because the court addressed it only under state law. Delayed arguments such as these are ordinarily deemed to have been waived. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Shell Co. (P.R.), Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"146034\"><a href=\"/opinion/146034/shell-co-v-los-frailes-service-station/\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2010); <i>United States v.

Young presents no persuasive argument as to why we should deviate from our established practice. Thus, we apply AEDPA's deferential standard of review to both of Young's claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Categorical Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Young first argues that a diagnosis of APD can never serve as a sufficient basis for civil commitment because the disorder does not affect volition and is so prevalent among criminal offenders that it cannot be used to distinguish ordinary recidivists from the dangerously mentally ill. The Massachusetts Court of Appeals declined to adopt this argument in the abstract way in which Young presented it and instead disposed of the case by examining the evidentiary record to determine whether sufficient evidence was produced at trial to demonstrate that Young's APD seriously impairs his ability to control his sexual impulses. <i>Young,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1042916</span></span>, at *2. We hold that the state court's analytical choice represents a reasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has not decided whether a diagnosis of APD can qualify by itself as a sufficiently serious impairment to support the civil commitment of a dangerous individual.<sup>[2]</sup> The Court's decisions in <i>Hendricks</i> and <i>Crane,</i> however, suggest that the general issue as to whether a particular mental disorder can serve as a sufficient basis for civil commitment ordinarily is not susceptible to categorical analysis. In <i>Hendricks,</i> the court declined to give \"talismanic significance\" to the terminology used by the psychiatric community when evaluating the constitutionality of a state statute that based commitment on a finding of \"mental abnormality\" rather than \"mental illness.\" 521 U.S. at 359, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118136\"><a href=\"/opinion/118136/kansas-v-hendricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2072</span></a></span>. Instead, recognizing that civil commitment ultimately turns on law rather than psychiatry, the court gave <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> state legislatures significant latitude in specifying the circumstances under which civil commitment will be warranted. <i>Id.</i> More recently, in <i>Crane,</i> the Court endorsed a contextual approach to the determination of whether an impairment results in serious difficulty in controlling behavior by stating that the determination should be made \"in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis, and the severity of the mental abnormality itself....\" 534 U.S. at 413, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118479\"><a href=\"/opinion/118479/kansas-v-crane/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>. When read together, these decisions suggest that a diagnostic label such as APD, while relevant, will rarely be dispositive in determining whether an impairment is sufficiently substantial to seriously impair volition. Instead, it is the manner in which the condition \"manifests itself in the individual\" that will determine whether a particular commitment decision meets the requirements of the due process clause. <i>Brown v. Watters,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"400\"><a href=\"/opinion/400/brown-v-watters/\"><span class=\"volume\">599</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span>, 614 (7th Cir.2010). Because the state court followed this approach, it did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court precedent when it refused to credit Young's categorical claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Contextual Claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Young alternatively challenges the jury's verdict by claiming that the record does not establish that APD causes him serious difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses. He supports this argument by (1) noting that he was not found to have a paraphilia<sup>[3]</sup> such as exhibitionism or pedophilia in addition to APD and (2) citing excerpts from the cross-examinations of the three experts who testified for the Commonwealth, which arguably could be read to suggest that Young retains the capacity to control his sexual impulses in certain circumstances. We hold that the Massachusetts Court of Appeals did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court precedent in rejecting this argument.</p>\n<p>Like all questions of evidentiary sufficiency, this one must be analyzed on the basis of the record. Although Young claims that APD cannot affect volition when it is unaccompanied by paraphilia, he fails to identify any evidence in the record to support this assertion. Instead, he cites <i>United States v. Wilkinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1749779\"><a href=\"/opinion/1749779/united-states-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 205 (D.Mass.2009), which recognizes that the psychiatric community is divided on the subject. <i>See also </i><i>Brown,</i> 599 F.3d at 613 &amp; n. 13 (describing the debate concerning whether APD is an appropriate predicate for civil commitment). Even if it were appropriate to consider judicial decisions recognizing the current controversy in examining the state court's sufficiency determinationan issue we need not decidethese cases at most suggest that experts disagree, and such reasonable disagreements simply are not dispositive. <i>Id.</i> at 613-14. What matters here is that all three of the experts who testified in this case were in agreement that Young's APD causes him serious difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses.</p>\n<p>Young's effort to cast doubt on the experts' opinions by pointing to selected excerpts drawn from their cross-examinations is also unpersuasive. As the record demonstrates, Young's impulse control problems date back to childhood and have continued throughout his incarceration. His two sexual offense convictions, as well as the evidence that he placed obscene phone calls from prison and possessed sexually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> explicit contraband while he was awaiting trial in the current matter, also provide substantial support for the experts' opinions that Young continues to experience substantial difficulty in controlling his sexual impulses. Although the record could be read to suggest that Young is able to control those impulses in certain circumstances, the Supreme Court has held that a total lack of volitional control is not required to justify the commitment of a dangerous sex offender. <i>Crane,</i> 534 U.S. at 411, 413, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118479\"><a href=\"/opinion/118479/kansas-v-crane/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>. Accordingly, the state court did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court precedent when it determined that Young suffered from a sufficiently serious mental impairment to warrant his civil commitment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The district court's decision denying Young's petition for habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"DSM-IV\"), the authoritative reference used in diagnosing mental disorders, an individual suffers from APD if he meets four criteria. First, he must pervasively disregard the rights of others, as indicated by at least three of the following: (1) \"failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors,\" (2) \"deceitfulness,\" (3) \"impulsivity,\" (4) \"irritability and aggressiveness,\" (5) \"reckless disregard for [the] safety of self or others,\" (6) \"consistent irresponsibility,\" and (7) \"lack of remorse.\" Second, he must be at least eighteen years old. Third, he must have exhibited symptoms of \"conduct disorder,\" another DSM-IV disorder that is also characterized by a failure to abide by social norms, beginning before the age of fifteen. Finally, his antisocial behavior must not be caused exclusively by schizophrenia or a manic episode.

As other courts have noted, however, the court did not have to consider whether a diagnosis of APD can ever qualify as a sufficiently serious mental impairment to justify a civil commitment determination because the state stipulated that Foucha was not mentally ill. <i>See </i><i>Brown v.
