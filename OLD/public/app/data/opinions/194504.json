Absent  explicit  congressional\n\nauthorization to the contrary, the district court had no choice but to\n\ndismiss the present action for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n(1979).\n\n***The Narragansett Indian Tribe acquired  federal status in 1983, see\n                                                                      \nNarragansett  Indian  Tribe v.

Even though it would be of no small signif-\nicance  in  defining the  Tribe's sovereign  status, Maynard  cites no\nreference  during the 1983 recognition process to an abrogation of the\nTribe's sovereignty, or  to an acknowledgement of any  past abrogation\nor waiver of its sovereign immunity.  \n\n                                  4\n",
