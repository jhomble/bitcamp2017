Evans Stroman appeals from his\n\nconviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm,   18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g)(1) (2000), raising arguments under the Fourth and Fifth\n\nAmendments.   The factual background is undisputed but some detail\n\nis needed to frame the issues.\n\n          Just after 5 a.m., on July 15, 2003, police in Lewiston,\n\nMaine, received a call informing them that two black men wearing t-\n\nshirts were attempting to break down the front door of an apartment\n\nbuilding at 287 Bates Street, near the high-crime neighborhood of\n\nKennedy Park.   The caller indicated that one of the two men was\n\nnamed BJ, which the officers took as a reference to BJ Almeida, a\n\nrepeat offender for whom an arrest warrant was outstanding.\n\n          At the scene, police found a single black man (later\n\ndetermined to be BJ's brother Jose Almeida) standing on the porch\n\nat 287 Bates Street, but he refused to answer their questions,\n\nindicating only that he was from Massachusetts.   Officers who had\n\nprior experience with BJ Almeida confirmed that this was not BJ,\n\nand so the police split up to continue the search.\n\n          Knox Street runs parallel to Bates Street just one block\n\nover.   There, about three hundred feet from the 287 Bates Street\n\napartment building, Lt. Donald Mailhot saw a car with Massachusetts\n\nplates, oddly parked near the back stairway to another Bates Street\n\napartment building.    Stroman (who is black) and a woman were\n\nsitting in the back-seat of the car.    At approximately the same\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\ftime as Mailhot left his police cruiser to approach the vehicle, a\n\nradio dispatch announced that another officer had BJ Almeida in\n\ncustody.\n\n            As Mailhot approached the parked car, Stroman got out and\n\nbegan to walk in the opposite direction.    He was told to stop, but\n\ndid not.    Mailhot then sought to restrain Stroman, who broke free\n\nand fled, leaving his leather coat in the officer's hands. Mailhot\n\nradioed the other officers with Stroman's description, and he was\n\ndiscovered shortly after, hiding on the fourth floor of a building\n\non Knox Street.\n\n            Stroman was handcuffed and frisked, and after finding a\n\nknife the police arrested him.      He was taken to a nearby jail,\n\nwhere a more complete search revealed crack cocaine inside his\n\nsweatshirt.    Learning from Massachusetts police that Stroman was\n\nknown to carry a gun, one of the officers then returned to the spot\n\nwhere Stroman had been found and discovered, inside a partially\n\najar ceiling tile directly above, a loaded handgun wrapped in a\n\nbandanna.\n\n            Because a fingerprint on the gun did not match Stroman's,\n\nStroman was at the outset charged only with offenses related to the\n\ndrugs and knife; but some five months later in a prison interview\n\nwith agents Stroman confessed (after Miranda warnings) that he had\n\nbeen holding the gun for BJ Almeida.    According to the confession,\n\nStroman had traveled from Massachusetts with BJ, who had left the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fcar to confront his girlfriend living at 287 Bates Street over a\n\npersonal matter.\n\n            Stroman was then charged in federal court with being a\n\nfelon in possession of a firearm.      He sought to suppress both the\n\ngun and the confession on fourth amendment grounds, arguing that\n\nboth constitute fruits of a poisonous tree (the tree being his\n\ninitial stop and attempted frisk by Mailhot outside the car).       A\n\nmagistrate judge recommended rejection of Stroman's suppression\n\nmotion after an evidentiary hearing, and the district judge upheld\n\nthat recommendation.\n\n            At trial, the prosecutor relied on Stroman's confession\n\nand on evidence of Mailhot's chase of Stroman and his arrest and\n\nthe later discovery of the gun overhead.       Testimony also showed\n\nthat Jose Almeida had made urgent efforts to retrieve Stroman's\n\ncoat from Mailhot after Stroman fled and that he had said to\n\nStroman at the police station that the police were \"lucky they\n\ndidn't get 10\" (the gun had a clip that carried ten bullets).\n\n            Stroman did not testify but offered a fingerprint expert\n\nconfirming that the print on the gun was not his.          In closing\n\narguments, the prosecutor argued that Stroman's confession was\n\nreliable,    pointing   to   various   elements   that   were   either\n\naffirmatively corroborated or \"not contradicted.\"         The defense\n\nobjected, at least in part, to these \"not contradicted\" references\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fas violating Stroman's fifth amendment rights; but the judge\n\nrejected the claim.\n\n            After   considerable    deliberation,       the   jury    convicted\n\nStroman, who was sentenced to 35 months in prison.               He now appeals,\n\ncontesting the admission of his confession and gun and arguing that\n\nthe prosecutor's \"not contradicted\" comments were improper.                    On\n\nreview, raw factual determinations are tested for clear error and\n\nlegal principles de novo, United States v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96, 100\n\n(1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1320 (2007), while law\n\napplication issues sometimes but not always are reviewed with some\n\nbut   not   automatic    deference.         Coady   Corp.   v.    Toyota     Motor\n\nDistribs., 361 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. 2004).1\n\n            We   start   with   Stroman's      fourth   amendment      claim.\n\nStroman's basic argument runs as follows: Mailhot lacked reasonable\n\nsuspicion to stop and attempt to frisk him outside the car on the\n\nmorning of his arrest.       It was only as a result of that illegal\n\nstop that the gun was ultimately discovered, and similarly, the\n\nconfession would never have been extracted in the absence of the\n\nallegedly    unconstitutional      frisk      and   subsequent      arrest    and\n\nimprisonment.\n\n\n      1\n      Application issues--classing a unique set of facts under a\ngeneral standard--are in formal terms legal rulings.       Often a\nmeasure of deference is shown to the factfinder, partly on the\nground that the rulings are often dependent on factual nuance,\nJackson v. United States, 156 F.3d 230, 232-33 (1st Cir. 1998); but\noccasionally (for policy reasons of its own) the Supreme Court\ninsists on de novo review as to a specific issue.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f              The government says that Stroman has no \"standing\" to\n\nobject to the seizure of the gun, arguing that Stroman lacked any\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the gun--first, because he\n\nabandoned it, see Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 241 (1960),\n\nand second, because even if he did not abandon it, he left it in a\n\ncommon area of a shared residential building, see United States v.\n\nBrown, 169 F.3d 89, 92 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n              This objection does not refer to Article III standing--\n\nwhich    is   clearly   present--but   essentially   to   the   substantive\n\nquestion whether Stroman had a sufficient personal or privacy\n\ninterest in the gun to trigger fourth amendment protection against\n\nits seizure.     United States   v. Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 5 n.1 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).    But he is not relying on this kind of fourth amendment\n\nclaim: his objection is to his allegedly illegal seizure, of which\n\nthe gun and confession are arguably the fruits.       Wong Sun v. United\n\nStates, 371 U.S. 471, 487-88 (1963).\n\n              However, the claim on the merits is easily dispatched.\n\nWe need not consider whether Stroman's seizure is sufficiently\n\nlinked with the gun and confession, cf. United States v. Kornegay,\n\n410 F.3d 89, 93-94 (1st Cir. 2005), because we think that the\n\nseizure itself constituted a Terry stop for which there was ample\n\njustification.      Unlike an arrest, for which probable cause is\n\nrequired, a Terry stop--which is less intrusive--requires only\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\freasonable suspicion of Stroman's involvement in wrongdoing. Terry\n\nv. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968).\n\n            If so, Mailhot was entitled to halt and briefly question\n\nStroman, United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 686 (1985), and the\n\nattempt to frisk him would itself be justified as a self-protection\n\nmeasure: an officer approaching a suspect in connection with a\n\nbreak-in    is   entitled   to    ensure    that   no    weapons      are   hidden\n\nunderneath a heavy leather coat.           Terry, 392 U.S. at 27.           Whether\n\n(on   the   undisputed   facts)    there    was    a    basis   for   reasonable\n\nsuspicion is one of those law application issues that we have been\n\ntold to review de novo.      Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690,\n\n699 (1996).\n\n            Stroman says that when Mailhot approached the car, BJ\n\nAlmeida and another man were already in custody (only two men had\n\nbeen allegedly involved in the break-in); but Mailhot said that he\n\ndid not know this and the magistrate judge so found.                         Still,\n\nStroman argues he and Almeida look nothing alike; that he was not\n\nwearing a t-shirt (as reported of the break-in suspects); and that\n\nhe was accompanied by a woman (the report of the break-in had not\n\nmentioned a woman).\n\n            Yet the car, oddly parked near the location of the\n\nalleged crime, bore Massachusetts plates (the reported break-in was\n\nassociated with a Massachusetts suspect); two individuals were in\n\nthe back-seat at a very early hour of the morning; and one of them\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f(Stroman) left the car as the officer approached, walking in the\n\nopposite direction and ignoring directions to stop.                           Further,\n\nStroman was wearing a leather coat in July, a fact that the officer\n\nreasonably considered curious and perhaps suggestive of hidden\n\nweapons.\n\n              All   of   these    elements      have   been    noted    in   cases    as\n\nrelevant--the car location, Kimball, 25 F.3d at 6, the \"unprovoked\n\nflight,\" Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 125 (2000), the unusual\n\ndress, United States v. Maguire, 359 F.3d 71, 77 (1st Cir. 2004)--\n\nand common sense would make them relevant anyway.                     The high-crime\n\nnature of the neighborhood is also rationally relevant although\n\nsometimes      debated     on    policy    grounds.2          Regardless      of     the\n\nneighborhood, Mailhot had ample reason to detain Stroman briefly.\n\n              Turning to the fifth amendment issue, we put to one side\n\nthe government's claim that Stroman did not fully preserve his\n\nobjection because he complained during the closing about only one\n\nof the prosecutor's several \"not contradicted\" comments and then\n\nmade a broader objection only after the jury had retired.                             On\n\nbalance, we think that defense counsel made his concerns known once\n\nit   became    clear     that    the   prosecutor      was    using    the   debatable\n\nlanguage as a theme, and that here that was sufficient.\n\n\n      2\n      Compare, e.g., United States v. Trullo, 809 F.2d 108, 111\n(1st Cir. 1987) (majority opinion), cert. denied, 482 U.S. 916\n(1987), with id. at 116 (Bownes, J., dissenting). See also United\nStates v. Goddard, No. 05-3080, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 14828 at *18,\n*35 (D.C. Cir. June 22, 2007) (Brown, J., dissenting).\n\n                                          -8-\n\f           Although   the   fifth   amendment's   text   precludes   only\n\nlegally   compelled   self-incrimination    (i.e.,   holding   reticent\n\ndefendants in contempt), the Supreme Court announced in Griffin v.\n\nCalifornia, 380 U.S. 609 (1965), that \"comment on the refusal to\n\ntestify\" burdens the constitutional privilege and is therefore\n\nprohibited.   Id. at 614.    Thus the judge may not instruct, or the\n\nprosecutor ask, a jury to take the defendant's exercise of his\n\nfifth amendment rights as an implication of guilt.\n\n           Griffin itself concerned direct and pointed references to\n\na defendant's lack of testimony. Indirect reference, under certain\n\ncircumstances, is also within the ban.     We have said that the test\n\nis\n\n           whether,   in   the  circumstances   of   the\n           particular case, the language used was\n           manifestly intended or was of such character\n           that the jury would naturally and necessarily\n           take it to be a comment on the failure of the\n           accused to testify.\n\nUnited States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 307 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Glantz, 810 F.2d 316, 322 (1st Cir. 1987), cert.\n\ndenied, 482 U.S. 929 (1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted);\n\nsee also United States v. Cotnam, 88 F.3d 487, 497 (7th Cir. 1996),\n\ncert. denied, 519 U.S. 942 (1996).\n\n           At the same time, the prosecutor is entitled to draw the\n\njury's attention to the balance of evidence on contested issues.\n\nAfter all, putting on the government's case is a sort of compulsion\n\nof the defendant to answer it; and the government \"must also be\n\n                                    -9-\n\ffree to engage in normal advocacy so long as it does not point a\n\nfinger at the accused's remaining silent in the courtroom.\" United\n\nStates ex rel. Leak v. Follette, 418 F.2d 1266, 1268 (2d Cir. 1969)\n\n(Friendly, J.), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1050 (1970). More recently,\n\nthe Supreme Court itself warned against extending \"broad dicta\" in\n\nGriffin so as to deny the prosecutor \"the opportunity to meet\n\nfairly the evidence and arguments\" of the defense.             United States\n\nv. Robinson, 485 U.S. 25, 33 (1988).\n\n             Indeed,   in     Robinson,     the   Supreme   Court      expressly\n\nqualified Griffin and carved out an exception for prosecutors who\n\ndirectly and deliberately refer to a defendant's lack of testimony\n\nwhile   \"fairly   responding    to     an   argument   of   the       defendant.\"\n\nRobinson, 485 U.S. at 34.       In that case, defense counsel claimed\n\nthat defendant had never been given a chance to tell his side of\n\nthe story. In other words, there are pressures in both directions,\n\nand the effort is to seek a practical resolution.\n\n           Some of our earlier case law might seem to support a\n\nmechanical   test   whereby    error    occurred    wherever      a   prosecutor\n\nreferred to a lack of defense evidence and that evidence could only\n\nhave been supplied by the defendant himself, United States v.\n\nFlannery, 451 F.2d 880, 882 (1st Cir. 1971), but such a reading\n\nwould hardly comport with Robinson.          We think that a better guide\n\nis our later and more nuanced test in Lilly, taking account of\n\nconsidered intention and inevitable effect in the context of the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fparticular facts and of Robinson's caution as to the prosecutor's\n\nright to a fair reply.           Accord United States v. Francis, 82 F.3d\n\n77, 79 (4th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1250 (1996).\n\n            In this instance, the prosecutor was faced with a claim\n\nthat the confession was flawed and unreliable due to the agents'\n\nunfairness and misunderstandings by the defendant, and that little\n\ndirect evidence linked Stroman to the gun: it was not on his person\n\nand his fingerprints did not match the one on the gun.                         Although\n\nthe   prosecutor       had    useful   circumstantial           evidence     (Stroman's\n\nflight, the location of the gun, Jose Almeida's remark), the\n\nprosecutor      had    special   reason      to    attempt      to    corroborate     the\n\nconfession.\n\n            Further,         defense   counsel       repeatedly           attacked    the\n\nreliability of the confession in cross examination and in the\n\nclosing argument, and the judge instructed the jurors that when\n\nconsidering the confession they should consider \"circumstances\n\ntending    to    corroborate      or   contradict         the    version     of   events\n\ndescribed in the statement.\" The prosecutor's response was to take\n\nelements   of    the    confession     one    by    one    and       to   summarize   the\n\ngovernment's evidence for the fact (e.g., that Stroman drove to\n\nMaine with the Almeida brothers) and then point to what was or was\n\nnot on the other side.\n\n            In this case, other witnesses, like the Almeida brothers\n\nor the woman in the back-seat of the car, could have contradicted\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fmany elements of the confession if they were untrue, although\n\nadmittedly not all: Stroman's confession that he hid the gun when\n\nhe was alone in the building, for example, might realistically have\n\nbeen difficult to contradict without Stroman's own testimony.            If\n\nthe comments are taken together, this is far from a case of naked\n\nfinger-pointing at the defendant.\n\n          The   prosecutor   does    take   a   risk   whenever   the   \"not\n\ncontradicted\" argument is made.      But, in this case, the prosecutor\n\nhad a perfectly legitimate reason for summing up the evidence on\n\neach side.   There is nothing like a \"manifest[] inten[t]\" on the\n\nprosecutor's part to focus the jury's attention on the defendant's\n\nsilence; nor do we think that the jury would \"naturally and\n\nnecessarily take [the remarks] to be a comment on the failure of\n\nthe accused to testify.\"     Cf. United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84\n\nF.3d 22, 31 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f",

The factual background is undisputed but some detail is needed to frame the issues.</p>\n<p>Just after 5 a.m., on July 15, 2003, police in Lewiston, Maine, received a call informing them that two black men wearing t-shirts were attempting to break down the front door of an apartment building at 287 Bates Street, near the high-crime neighborhood of Kennedy Park. The caller indicated that one of the two men was named BJ, which the officers took as a reference to BJ Almeida, a repeat offender for whom an arrest warrant was outstanding.</p>\n<p>At the scene, police found a single black man (later determined to be BJ's brother Jose Almeida) standing on the porch at 287 Bates Street, but he refused to answer their questions, indicating only that he was from Massachusetts.

At approximately the same time as Mailhot left his police cruiser to approach the vehicle, a radio dispatch announced that another officer had BJ Almeida in custody.</p>\n<p>As Mailhot approached the parked car, Stroman got out and began to walk in the opposite direction. He was told to stop, but did not. Mailhot then sought to restrain Stroman, who broke free and fled, leaving his leather coat in the officer's hands. Mailhot radioed the other officers with Stroman's description, and he was discovered shortly after, hiding on the fourth floor of a building on Knox Street.</p>\n<p>Stroman was handcuffed and frisked, and after finding a knife the police arrested him. He was taken to a nearby jail, where a more complete search revealed crack cocaine inside his sweatshirt. Learning from Massachusetts police that Stroman was known to carry a gun, one of the officers then returned to the spot where Stroman had been found and discovered, inside a partially ajar ceiling tile directly above, a loaded handgun wrapped in a bandanna.</p>\n<p>Because a fingerprint on the gun did not match Stroman's, Stroman was at the outset charged only with offenses related to the drugs and knife; but some five months later in a prison interview with agents Stroman confessed (after <i>Miranda</i> warnings) that he had been holding the gun for BJ Almeida. According to the confession, Stroman had traveled from Massachusetts with BJ, who had left the car to confront his girlfriend living at 287 Bates Street over a personal matter.</p>\n<p>Stroman was then charged in federal court with being a felon in possession of a firearm. He sought to suppress both the gun and the confession on fourth amendment grounds, arguing that both constitute fruits of a poisonous tree (the tree being his initial stop and attempted frisk by Mailhot outside the car). A magistrate judge recommended rejection of Stroman's suppression motion after an evidentiary hearing, and the district judge upheld that recommendation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> At trial, the prosecutor relied on Stroman's confession and on evidence of Mailhot's chase of Stroman and his arrest and the later discovery of the gun overhead. Testimony also showed that Jose Almeida had made urgent efforts to retrieve Stroman's coat from Mailhot after Stroman fled and that he had said to Stroman at the police station that the police were \"lucky they didn't get 10\" (the gun had a clip that carried ten bullets).</p>\n<p>Stroman did not testify but offered a fingerprint expert confirming that the print on the gun was not his. In closing arguments, the prosecutor argued that Stroman's confession was reliable, pointing to various elements that were either affirmatively corroborated or \"not contradicted.\" The defense objected, at least in part, to these \"not contradicted\" references as violating Stroman's fifth amendment rights; but the judge rejected the claim.</p>\n<p>After considerable deliberation, the jury convicted Stroman, who was sentenced to 35 months in prison. He now appeals, contesting the admission of his confession and gun and arguing that the prosecutor's \"not contradicted\" comments were improper. On review, raw factual determinations are tested for clear error and legal principles <i>de novo, </i><i>United States v. Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1320, 167 L.Ed.2d 130 (2007), while law application issues sometimes but not always are reviewed with some but not automatic deference. <i>Coady Corp. v. Toyota Motor Distribs.,</i> 361 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir.2004).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>We start with Stroman's fourth amendment claim. Stroman's basic argument runs as follows: Mailhot lacked reasonable suspicion to stop and attempt to frisk him outside the car on the morning of his arrest. It was only as a result of that illegal stop that the gun was ultimately discovered, and similarly, the confession would never have been extracted in the absence of the allegedly unconstitutional frisk and subsequent arrest and imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The government says that Stroman has no \"standing\" to object to the seizure of the gun, arguing that Stroman lacked any reasonable expectation of privacy in the gunfirst, because he abandoned it, <i>see </i><i>Abel v. United States,</i> 362 U.S. 217, 241, 80 S.Ct. 683, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960), and second, because even if he did not abandon it, he left it in a common area of a shared residential building, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> 169 F.3d 89, 92 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>This objection does not refer to Article III standingwhich is clearly present  but essentially to the substantive question whether Stroman had a sufficient personal or privacy interest in the gun to trigger fourth amendment protection against its seizure. <i>United States v. Kimball,</i> 25 F.3d 1, 5 n. 1 (1st Cir.1994). But he is not relying on this kind of fourth amendment claim: his objection is to <i>his</i> allegedly illegal seizure, of which the gun and confession are arguably the fruits. <i>Wong Sun v. United States,</i> 371 U.S. 471, 487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).</p>\n<p>However, the claim on the merits is easily dispatched. We need not consider whether Stroman's seizure is sufficiently linked with the gun and confession, <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Kornegay,</i> 410 F.3d 89, 93-94 (1st Cir.2005), because we think that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> the seizure itself constituted a <i>Terry</i> stop for which there was ample justification. Unlike an arrest, for which probable cause is required, a <i>Terry</i> stopwhich is less intrusiverequires only reasonable suspicion of Stroman's involvement in wrongdoing. <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p>If so, Mailhot was entitled to halt and briefly question Stroman, <i>United States v. Sharpe,</i> 470 U.S. 675, 686, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985), and the attempt to frisk him would itself be justified as a self-protection measure: an officer approaching a suspect in connection with a break-in is entitled to ensure that no weapons are hidden underneath a heavy leather coat. <i>Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Whether (on the undisputed facts) there was a basis for reasonable suspicion is one of those law application issues that we have been told to review <i>de novo. </i><i>Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p>Stroman says that when Mailhot approached the car, BJ Almeida and another man were already in custody (only two men had been allegedly involved in the break-in); but Mailhot said that he did not know this and the magistrate judge so found. Still, Stroman argues he and Almeida look nothing alike; that he was not wearing a t-shirt (as reported of the break-in suspects); and that he was accompanied by a woman (the report of the break-in had not mentioned a woman).</p>\n<p>Yet the car, oddly parked near the location of the alleged crime, bore Massachusetts plates (the reported break-in was associated with a Massachusetts suspect); two individuals were in the back-seat at a very early hour of the morning; and one of them (Stroman) left the car as the officer approached, walking in the opposite direction and ignoring directions to stop. Further, Stroman was wearing a leather coat in July, a fact that the officer reasonably considered curious and perhaps suggestive of hidden weapons.</p>\n<p>All of these elements have been noted in cases as relevantthe car location, <i>Kimball,</i> 25 F.3d at 6, the \"unprovoked flight,\" <i>Illinois v. Wardlow,</i> 528 U.S. 119, 125, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000), the unusual dress, <i>United States v. Maguire,</i> 359 F.3d 71, 77 (1st Cir.2004)and common sense would make them relevant anyway. The high-crime nature of the neighborhood is also rationally relevant although sometimes debated on policy grounds.<sup>[2]</sup> Regardless of the neighborhood, Mailhot had ample reason to detain Stroman briefly.</p>\n<p>Turning to the fifth amendment issue, we put to one side the government's claim that Stroman did not fully preserve his objection because he complained during the closing about only one of the prosecutor's several \"not contradicted\" comments and then made a broader objection only after the jury had retired. On balance, we think that defense counsel made his concerns known once it became clear that the prosecutor was using the debatable language as a theme, and that here that was sufficient.</p>\n<p>Although the fifth amendment's text precludes only legally compelled self-incrimination (<i>i.e.,</i> holding reticent defendants in contempt), the Supreme Court announced in <i>Griffin v. California,</i> 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> (1965), that \"comment on the refusal to testify\" burdens the constitutional privilege and is therefore prohibited. <i>Id.</i> at 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229. Thus the judge may not instruct, or the prosecutor ask, a jury to take the defendant's exercise of his fifth amendment rights as an implication of guilt.</p>\n<p><i>Griffin</i> itself concerned direct and pointed references to a defendant's lack of testimony. Indirect reference, under certain circumstances, is also within the ban. We have said that the test is</p>\n<blockquote>whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d 300, 307 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting <i>United States v. Glantz,</i> 810 F.2d 316, 322 (1st Cir.1987), <i>cert. denied,</i> 482 U.S. 929, 107 S.Ct. 3214, 96 L.Ed.2d 701 (1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Cotnam,</i> 88 F.3d 487, 497 (7th Cir.1996), <i>cert. denied,</i> 519 U.S. 942, 117 S.Ct. 326, 136 L.Ed.2d 240 (1996).</p>\n<p>At the same time, the prosecutor is entitled to draw the jury's attention to the balance of evidence on contested issues. After all, putting on the government's case is a sort of compulsion of the defendant to answer it; and the government \"must also be free to engage in normal advocacy so long as it does not point a finger at the accused's remaining silent in the courtroom.\" <i>United States ex rel. Leak v. Follette,</i> 418 F.2d 1266, 1268 (2d Cir.1969) (Friendly, J.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 397 U.S. 1050, 90 S.Ct. 1388, 25 L.Ed.2d 665 (1970). More recently, the Supreme Court itself warned against extending \"broad dicta\" in <i>Griffin</i> so as to deny the prosecutor \"the opportunity to meet fairly the evidence and arguments\" of the defense. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 485 U.S. 25, 33, 108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988).</p>\n<p>Indeed, in <i>Robinson,</i> the Supreme Court expressly qualified <i>Griffin</i> and carved out an exception for prosecutors who directly and deliberately refer to a defendant's lack of testimony while \"fairly responding to an argument of the defendant.\" <i>Robinson,</i> 485 U.S. at 34, 108 S.Ct. 864. In that case, defense counsel claimed that defendant had never been given a chance to tell his side of the story. In other words, there are pressures in both directions, and the effort is to seek a practical resolution.</p>\n<p>Some of our earlier case law might seem to support a mechanical test whereby error occurred wherever a prosecutor referred to a lack of defense evidence and that evidence could only have been supplied by the defendant himself, <i>United States v. Flannery,</i> 451 F.2d 880, 882 (1st Cir.1971), but such a reading would hardly comport with <i>Robinson.</i> We think that a better guide is our later and more nuanced test in <i>Lilly,</i> taking account of considered intention and inevitable effect in the context of the particular facts and of <i>Robinson</i>'s caution as to the prosecutor's right to a fair reply. <i>Accord </i><i>United States v. Francis,</i> 82 F.3d 77, 79 (4th Cir.1996), <i>cert. denied,</i> 517 U.S. 1250, 116 S.Ct. 2513, 135 L.Ed.2d 202 (1996).</p>\n<p>In this instance, the prosecutor was faced with a claim that the confession was flawed and unreliable due to the agents' unfairness and misunderstandings by the defendant, and that little direct evidence linked Stroman to the gun: it was not on his person and his fingerprints did not match the one on the gun. Although the prosecutor had useful circumstantial evidence (Stroman's flight, the location of the gun, Jose Almeida's remark), the prosecutor had special reason to attempt to corroborate the confession.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> Further, defense counsel repeatedly attacked the reliability of the confession in cross examination and in the closing argument, and the judge instructed the jurors that when considering the confession they should consider \"circumstances tending to corroborate or contradict the version of events described in the statement.\" The prosecutor's response was to take elements of the confession one by one and to summarize the government's evidence for the fact (<i>e.g.,</i> that Stroman drove to Maine with the Almeida brothers) and then point to what was or was not on the other side.</p>\n<p>In this case, other witnesses, like the Almeida brothers or the woman in the back-seat of the car, could have contradicted many elements of the confession if they were untrue, although admittedly not all: Stroman's confession that he hid the gun when he was alone in the building, for example, might realistically have been difficult to contradict without Stroman's own testimony. If the comments are taken together, this is far from a case of naked finger-pointing at the defendant.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor does take a risk whenever the \"not contradicted\" argument is made. But, in this case, the prosecutor had a perfectly legitimate reason for summing up the evidence on each side. There is nothing like a \"manifest[] inten[t]\" on the prosecutor's part to focus the jury's attention on the defendant's silence; nor do we think that the jury would \"naturally and necessarily take [the remarks] to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\" <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v.

The factual background is undisputed but some detail is needed to frame the issues.</p>\n<p>Just after 5 a.m., on July 15, 2003, police in Lewiston, Maine, received a call informing them that two black men wearing t-shirts were attempting to break down the front door of an apartment building at 287 Bates Street, near the high-crime neighborhood of Kennedy Park. The caller indicated that one of the two men was named BJ, which the officers took as a reference to BJ Almeida, a repeat offender for whom an arrest warrant was outstanding.</p>\n<p>At the scene, police found a single black man (later determined to be BJ's brother Jose Almeida) standing on the porch at 287 Bates Street, but he refused to answer their questions, indicating only that he was from Massachusetts. Officers who had prior experience with BJ Almeida confirmed that this was not BJ, and so the police split up to continue the search.</p>\n<p>Knox Street runs parallel to Bates Street just one block over. There, about three hundred feet from the 287 Bates Street apartment building, Lt. Donald Mailhot saw a car with Massachusetts plates, oddly parked near the back stairway to another Bates Street apartment building.

Still, Stroman argues he and Almeida look nothing alike; that he was not wearing a t-shirt (as reported of the break-in suspects); and that he was accompanied by a woman (the report of the break-in had not mentioned a woman).</p>\n<p>Yet the car, oddly parked near the location of the alleged crime, bore Massachusetts plates (the reported break-in was associated with a Massachusetts suspect); two individuals were in the back-seat at a very early hour of the morning; and one of them (Stroman) left the car as the officer approached, walking in the opposite direction and ignoring directions to stop. Further, Stroman was wearing a leather coat in July, a fact that the officer reasonably considered curious and perhaps suggestive of hidden weapons.</p>\n<p>All of these elements have been noted in cases as relevantthe car location, <i>Kimball,</i> 25 F.3d at 6, the \"unprovoked flight,\" <i>Illinois v.

The high-crime nature of the neighborhood is also rationally relevant although sometimes debated on policy grounds.<sup>[2]</sup> Regardless of the neighborhood, Mailhot had ample reason to detain Stroman briefly.</p>\n<p>Turning to the fifth amendment issue, we put to one side the government's claim that Stroman did not fully preserve his objection because he complained during the closing about only one of the prosecutor's several \"not contradicted\" comments and then made a broader objection only after the jury had retired. On balance, we think that defense counsel made his concerns known once it became clear that the prosecutor was using the debatable language as a theme, and that here that was sufficient.</p>\n<p>Although the fifth amendment's text precludes only legally compelled self-incrimination (<i>i.e.,</i> holding reticent defendants in contempt), the Supreme Court announced in <i>Griffin v.

After all, putting on the government's case is a sort of compulsion of the defendant to answer it; and the government \"must also be free to engage in normal advocacy so long as it does not point a finger at the accused's remaining silent in the courtroom.\" <i>United States ex rel.

More recently, the Supreme Court itself warned against extending \"broad dicta\" in <i>Griffin</i> so as to deny the prosecutor \"the opportunity to meet fairly the evidence and arguments\" of the defense. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112010\"><a href=\"/opinion/112010/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112010\"><a href=\"/opinion/112010/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span> (1988).</p>\n<p>Indeed, in <i>Robinson,</i> the Supreme Court expressly qualified <i>Griffin</i> and carved out an exception for prosecutors who directly and deliberately refer to a defendant's lack of testimony while \"fairly responding to an argument of the defendant.\" <i>Robinson,</i> 485 U.S. at 34, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112010\"><a href=\"/opinion/112010/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>. In that case, defense counsel claimed that defendant had never been given a chance to tell his side of the story. In other words, there are pressures in both directions, and the effort is to seek a practical resolution.</p>\n<p>Some of our earlier case law might seem to support a mechanical test whereby error occurred wherever a prosecutor referred to a lack of defense evidence and that evidence could only have been supplied by the defendant himself, <i>United States v. Flannery,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"300190\"><a href=\"/opinion/300190/united-states-v-john-flannery/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span>, 882 (1st Cir.1971), but such a reading would hardly comport with <i>Robinson.</i> We think that a better guide is our later and more nuanced test in <i>Lilly,</i> taking account of considered intention and inevitable effect in the context of the particular facts and of <i>Robinson</i>'s caution as to the prosecutor's right to a fair reply. <i>Accord </i><i>United States v. Francis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716769\"><a href=\"/opinion/716769/united-states-v-hassan-francis/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 79 (4th Cir.1996), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></span> (1996).</p>\n<p>In this instance, the prosecutor was faced with a claim that the confession was flawed and unreliable due to the agents' unfairness and misunderstandings by the defendant, and that little direct evidence linked Stroman to the gun: it was not on his person and his fingerprints did not match the one on the gun. Although the prosecutor had useful circumstantial evidence (Stroman's flight, the location of the gun, Jose Almeida's remark), the prosecutor had special reason to attempt to corroborate the confession.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> Further, defense counsel repeatedly attacked the reliability of the confession in cross examination and in the closing argument, and the judge instructed the jurors that when considering the confession they should consider \"circumstances tending to corroborate or contradict the version of events described in the statement.\" The prosecutor's response was to take elements of the confession one by one and to summarize the government's evidence for the fact (<i>e.g.,</i> that Stroman drove to Maine with the Almeida brothers) and then point to what was or was not on the other side.</p>\n<p>In this case, other witnesses, like the Almeida brothers or the woman in the back-seat of the car, could have contradicted many elements of the confession if they were untrue, although admittedly not all: Stroman's confession that he hid the gun when he was alone in the building, for example, might realistically have been difficult to contradict without Stroman's own testimony. If the comments are taken together, this is far from a case of naked finger-pointing at the defendant.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor does take a risk whenever the \"not contradicted\" argument is made. But, in this case, the prosecutor had a perfectly legitimate reason for summing up the evidence on each side. There is nothing like a \"manifest[] inten[t]\" on the prosecutor's part to focus the jury's attention on the defendant's silence; nor do we think that the jury would \"naturally and necessarily take [the remarks] to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\" <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v.
