Melvin A. Brown appeals pro  se from\n                                                        \n\nthe  district court's  dismissal  of his  claims against  the\n\nTrial  Court  of  Massachusetts, District  Court  Department,\n\nSpringfield Division, Small  Claims Department and  the Trial\n\nCourt  of  Massachusetts,  District  Court  Department, Small\n\nClaims   Sessions,   Chicopee   Trial  Court,   state   court\n\ndefendants,   for  lack   of  subject   matter  jurisdiction,\n\ndismissal  of  his  federal  constitutional   claims  against\n\nChicopee  Fire Fighters  Local  1710 (the  \"Union\") as  time-\n\nbarred,  and dismissal  without  prejudice of  his state  law\n\nclaims  against  the Union.    The  district court  dismissed\n\nappellant's claims in two thorough and well-reasoned opinions\n\ndated  October 8,  1991 and  September 17,  1992.   We affirm\n\nbased on those opinions.  We add only the following comments.\n\n          On appeal, Brown's  central contention is that  the\n\ndistrict court mischaracterized his fair representation claim\n\nas a state law claim.  The district court determined that the\n\nNational Labor Relations Act did not apply to appellant, as a\n\nmunicipal   employee,   and   that,   therefore,   the   fair\n\nrepresentation claim could only  be brought pursuant to Mass.\n\nGen.  L.  ch.  150E.   Appellant  argues,  however,  that  by\n\nbreaching   its  statutory   obligation   to   provide   fair\n\nrepresentation, the Union violated his  constitutional rights\n\nto  due process of law.  Therefore, he contends, the district\n\ncourt has  jurisdiction over  the claim.   Furthermore, since\n\nthe failure to represent  is a \"continuing event,\" continuing\n\ninto  the  present time,  appellant  argues,  the statute  of\n\nlimitations  period  has not  yet  begun  to run,  much  less\n\nexpired.\n\n          Appellant has failed to  state a federal claim with\n\nrespect   to  his   assertion   that  he   was  denied   fair\n\nrepresentation by  the Union.  Therefore,  the district court\n\ndid not err in dismissing  his fair representation claim  for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction once it had dismissed all\n\nof  appellant's federal  claims.   The Union's  obligation to\n\nfairly represent appellant, if any, derives solely from state\n\nstatutory law.  As the district court stated in its September\n\n17, 1991 Memorandum and Order:\n\n          The   rights   of  public   employees  in\n          Massachusetts are governed by  the Public\n          Employee  Collective Bargaining  statute,\n          Mass. Gen.  L. ch.  150E.  Under  chapter\n          150E,   public  employees   may  initiate\n          failure to represent actions  with either\n          the    Massachusetts   Labor    Relations\n          Commission  or  in the  state  court.

As the district court correctly concluded, appellant, as\na municipal employee,  and the Union,  as a municipal  union,\nare excluded from the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.\n  185(a),  and therefore  appellant does not  have a  federal\nstatutory right to fair representation. \n\n                             -3-\n\nclaim pursuant to    1983 of deprivation of  a constitutional\n\nright by the  Union's alleged breach of its  obligation under\n\nstate law to fairly  represent him.  \"Mere alleged  misuse or\n\ndisregard of state law by state officials does not constitute\n\na deprivation  of property without constitutional due process\n\nof law.\" Malachowski v. City of Keene, 787 F.2d 704, 708 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.)  (citations  omitted),  cert.  denied,  479  U.S.  1022\n                                           \n\n(1986).  Thus, the  district court did not err  in dismissing\n\nappellant's fair  representation claim as a  state law claim.\n\nBecause  we  find that  appellant failed  to state  a federal\n\nclaim, we  need not  decide when the  statute of  limitations\n\nbegins to run on appellant's failure to represent claim.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n",
