This  appeal presents  several\n          SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\n                               \n\nissues of first impression in extradition law generally and, more\n\nspecifically, regarding  a rather distinctive  extradition treaty\n\nin  force between  the United  States and  the United  Kingdom of\n\nGreat  Britain and Northern  Ireland (U.K.).   We must determine,\n\ninter  alia, (1)  whether, under  the treaty,  the second  of two\n           \n\nsuccessive  appeals from  a certification  of  extraditability is\n\nwithin our  jurisdiction;  (2) if  so,  what standard  of  review\n\ngoverns such appeals; (3) whether the treaty alters the venerable\n\nrule  of  noninquiry; and  (4)  if  so, to  what  extent.   After\n\ngrappling with  these, and other, matters,  we eventually address\n\nthe merits of the  appeal and conclude that the  determination of\n\nextraditability must stand.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The seeds of  this appeal  were sown on  June 1,  1991,\n\nwhen  a  policeman discovered  the  mutilated  body of  Catherine\n\nElizabeth Ayling, a young white female, in the trunk  of a rental\n\ncar  abandoned   at   England's  Gatwick   Airport.     Suspicion\n\nimmediately  centered  on   respondent-appellant  Curtis   Andrew\n\nHoward,  a  United  States  citizen.    Charges  were  preferred.\n\nBecause  Howard   had  returned  to  his   native  land,  British\n\nauthorities sought to extradite him.  On June 5, 1991, the United\n\nStates Attorney  for the District of  Massachusetts requested and\n\nreceived from a federal  magistrate judge a warrant for  Howard's\n\nprovisional arrest.  See 18 U.S.C.   3184 (1988 &amp; Supp. II 1990);\n                        \n\nD. Mass. Loc. Mag. R. 1(e).  Howard was apprehended.  He appeared\n\n                                2\n\nfor  an  extradition  hearing  before  the  magistrate  judge  on\n\nSeptember 10, 1991.\n\n          At the hearing Howard did not dispute the  existence of\n\nprobable cause  to  believe  he had  murdered  Ayling.    Rather,\n\nHoward, who is black,  argued that he would be  prejudiced during\n\nlegal  proceedings  in  the  U.K.  by  reason  of  his  race  and\n\nnationality, a circumstance which, if true, constituted a defense\n\nto  extradition under  the  relevant treaty.   See  Supplementary\n                                                  \n\nExtradition  Treaty,   June  25,  1985,  U.S.-U.K.,   art.  3(a),\n\nreprinted in  S. Exec.  Rep. No. 17,  99th Cong., 2d  Sess. 15-17\n            \n\n(1986)  (Supplementary  Treaty).   In  support  of this  defense,\n\nHoward proffered evidence of flamboyant publicity surrounding his\n\ncase,  sought to  show that  Britons would  likely  be prejudiced\n\nagainst blacks    particularly  those accused of  murdering young\n\nwhite  females   and pointed out that England's legal system does\n\nnot  make  any provision  for  voir dire  of  prospective jurors.\n\nThese proffers did  not sufficiently impress the magistrate:   he\n\nruled  that  Howard  had  not  established  a  valid  defense  to\n\nextradition   and   thereupon    issued   a   certification    of\n\nextraditability, together with  an order of commitment.1   See 18\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.   3184.\n\n                    \n\n     1The magistrate  found that  all the basic  prerequisites to\nextradition  had been fulfilled in that the United States and the\nU.K. are parties to  an extradition treaty; a criminal  charge is\npending against Howard  in the  U.K.; the charged  offense is  an\nextraditable crime  under the treaty;  the person charged  is the\nsame  person  whom the  government  wants  extradited; an  arrest\nwarrant is outstanding; and probable cause exists to believe that\nHoward committed the crime.  None of these findings are contested\non appeal.\n\n                                3\n\n          Howard   appealed.     The  district   court  exercised\n\njurisdiction, reviewed the magistrate's findings for clear error,\n\nand affirmed.  See In re Howard, 791 F. Supp. 31 (D. Mass. 1992).\n                               \n\nHoward appeals anew.\n\nII.  THE SUPPLEMENTARY TREATY\n\n          Because the Supplementary  Treaty departs from accepted\n\nextradition protocol, we trace its origins  and spotlight its key\n\nprovisions.\n\n          In 1972, the United States  and the U.K. negotiated new\n\nterms   governing  reciprocal   extradition  from   one  nation's\n\nterritory  of persons  accused or  convicted of  certain offenses\n\ncommitted in the other  nation.  See Extradition Treaty,  June 8,\n                                    \n\n1972, U.S.-U.K., art. I,  28 U.S.T. 227, 229 (Treaty).  Under the\n\nTreaty, murder was an extraditable offense.  See id. art. III(1).\n                                                    \n\nNonetheless, the Treaty allowed a signatory to refuse extradition\n\nif it regarded  the offense  \"as one of  a political  character.\"\n\nId.  art. V(c)(i).  This exception sired friction between the two\n   \n\ntraditional allies when federal judges in the United States began\n\ninterpreting it to bar extradition of members of the  Provisional\n\nIrish Republican  Army.  See S.  Exec. Rep. No. 17,  supra, at 2;\n                                                          \n\nsee also 132 Cong. Rec. 16,558-86 (1986) (collecting cases).\n        \n\n          To   ameliorate   this   situation,   the   signatories\n\nnegotiated treaty  amendments aimed at eradicating  the political\n\noffense  exception for acts of violence.   See S. Treaty Doc. No.\n                                              \n\n8, 99th Cong., 1st  Sess. (1985) (Proposed Supplementary Treaty);\n\nsee  also  S. Exec.  Rep. No.  17, supra,  at  2.   However, when\n                                        \n\n                                4\n\nPresident Reagan  submitted the Proposed Supplementary  Treaty to\n\nthe Senate, seeking its advice and consent, the document received\n\nmixed   reviews.     See   United  States   and  United   Kingdom\n                                                                 \n\nSupplementary Extradition  Treaty:   Hearings  Before the  Senate\n                                                                 \n\nComm.  on  Foreign  Relations,  99th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.  (1985).\n                             \n\nFollowing  many months  of  strident debate,  the opposing  camps\n\nreached  a compromise,  placing  most violent  crimes beyond  the\n\npolitical  offense exception's  reach  but  adding certain  novel\n\nsafeguards for the  protection of potential extraditees.   See S.\n                                                              \n\nExec. Rep. No. 17, supra, at  4-5.  On July 17, 1986, the  Senate\n                        \n\nratified the  proposed treaty subject  to the addition  of these,\n\nand  other,  amendments.    See  132  Cong.  Rec. 16,819  (1986).\n                               \n\nFollowing approval  of  the  modified version  by  the  House  of\n\nCommons, instruments of ratification  were exchanged on  December\n\n23, 1986.  See  Supplementary Treaty, supra, reprinted at  Hein's\n                                                         \n\nNo. KAV 2053; see also I.I. Kavass et al., Extradition:  Laws and\n                                                                 \n\nTreaties  920.20d-h  (1979 &amp;  Supp. 1989).    At that  point, the\n        \n\nSupplementary Treaty went into force.\n\n          An aspect  of the Senate-forged compromise  lies at the\n\ncore  of the instant case.  As ratified, the Supplementary Treaty\n\nprohibits  extradition \"if the person sought establishes . . . by\n\na preponderance of evidence that . .  . he would, if surrendered,\n\nbe prejudiced at his trial or punished, detained or restricted in\n\nhis   personal  liberty   by  reason   of  his   race,  religion,\n\nnationality, or political opinions.\"  Supplementary  Treaty, art.\n\n3(a).  Appellant's case rests squarely upon this proviso.\n\n                                5\n\nIII.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n          The  Supplementary Treaty  stipulates that  the trier's\n\nfindings with regard to an article 3(a) defense  are \"immediately\n\nappealable  by either party to  the United States district court,\n\nor  court of  appeals,  as appropriate.\"   Id.  art.  3(b).   The\n                                              \n\ninitial question that commands  our attention concerns the extent\n\nof our jurisdiction under  this provision.  We raised  this issue\n\nat oral  argument, as a court  must when it harbors  doubts about\n\nthe  existence of  its  subject matter  jurisdiction,  see In  re\n                                                                 \n\nRecticel  Foam  Corp.,  859  F.2d  1000,  1002  (1st  Cir.  1988)\n                     \n\n(emphasizing  that \"a  court  has an  obligation  to inquire  sua\n\nsponte into  its subject matter jurisdiction\"),  and directed the\n\nparties to furnish supplemental briefs.2\n\n                        A.  Past Practice.\n                                         \n\n          Ordinarily neither  party to an  extradition proceeding\n\nmay challenge a decision rendered therein by direct appeal.  This\n\ndisability developed  because the  relevant statute, 18  U.S.C.  \n\n3184, does not  contemplate hearings by United  States courts qua\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States courts, see In re  Mackin, 668 F.2d 122, 125-30 (2d\n                                       \n\nCir.   1981)  (collecting  authorities  and  tracing  history  of\n\nextradition proceedings), but,  instead, directs that extradition\n\nmatters be heard by \"any justice or  judge of the United States,\"\n\nany authorized  magistrate, or certain state  judges.  Therefore,\n\n                    \n\n     2It  is,  of  course,  settled that  parties  cannot  confer\nsubject matter jurisdiction on a federal court by acquiescence or\nagreement.   See Insurance Corp. of Ir. v. Compagnie Des Bauxites\n                                                                 \nDe Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982).\n         \n\n                                6\n\nan  officer who presides over such a proceeding is not exercising\n\n\"any  part of the  judicial power of  the United States.\"   In re\n                                                                 \n\nKaine,  55 U.S. (14  How.) 103, 120 (1852).   Rather, the officer\n     \n\nacts  in a  non-institutional capacity  by virtue  of  a \"special\n\nauthority.\"  In re Metzger, 46 U.S. (5 How.) 176, 191 (1847); see\n                                                                 \n\nalso  Shapiro  v. Ferrandina,  478 F.2d  894,  901 n.3  (2d Cir.)\n                            \n\n(applying same principle to  current statutory provision),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndismissed,  414  U.S. 884  (1973);  Mackin,  668  F.2d at  125-30\n                                          \n\n(same);  Jimenez v.

The officer's only tasks are to determine whether\n\nan   individual  is   extraditable,   and  if   so,  to   certify\n\nextraditability to  the ultimate decisionmaker  (the Secretary of\n\nState).  See 18 U.S.C.    3184, 3186 (1988 &amp; Supp. II 1990).\n            \n\n          In light of this  curious arrangement, numerous  courts\n\nhave  held that 28 U.S.C.   1291, which permits appeals of \"final\n\ndecisions of  the district courts\" (emphasis  supplied), does not\n                                 \n\ncontemplate appeals from  decisions of judicial officers  sitting\n\nin  extradition matters.   See,  e.g., Ahmad  v. Wigen,  910 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1063, 1065 (2d  Cir. 1990); Quinn v.

Given the\n                              \n\nabsence of  any other statutory  hook on which  jurisdiction over\n\nsuch  appeals can be hung,  a putative extraditee customarily can\n\nchallenge  an order  for extradition  only by  collateral attack,\n\ntypically through habeas corpus.  See Collins v. Miller, 252 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n364, 369 (1920); Koskotas v.

By the same  token, the  government, if it  fails in  an\n\n                                7\n\nextradition attempt,  cannot appeal,  but  must file  anew.

Article 3(b).\n                                        \n\n          Appellant   argues   that   the  Supplementary   Treaty\n\nrevolutionizes  this  praxis  insofar as  the  extradition target\n\nasserts defenses  cognizable under article 3(a).   The government\n\nargues the inverse, imploring that  neither the President nor the\n\nSenate intended to  work so  abrupt a tergiversation.   We  agree\n\nwith appellant that the Supplementary Treaty, which has the force\n\nof  law, U.S.  Const. art.  VI, cl.  2, effects  a sea  change in\n\nestablished policy.\n\n          The Supplementary  Treaty provides that a finding anent\n\na  so-called  article  3(a) defense,  involving  race,  religion,\n\nnationality,   or  political   opinion,  \"shall   be  immediately\n\nappealable by either  party to the United States  district court,\n\nor court of appeals, as appropriate.\"  Supplementary Treaty, art.\n\n3(b).  This appeal provision, which apparently finds its  genesis\n\nin an earlier (failed) attempt  to alter the protocol prohibiting\n\ndirect appeals in extradition matters, see 132 Cong.  Rec. 16,599\n                                          \n\n(1986),  is couched  in plain  language and,  in our  view, means\n\nprecisely  what it  says.   See Sumitomo  Shoji America,  Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nAvagliano, 457 U.S. 176,  180 (1982) (explaining that a  treaty's\n         \n\nliteral language must be given effect unless patently contrary to\n\nthe signatories'  intentions and expectations).   In crafting the\n\n                                8\n\nappeal  provision,  the  drafters carefully  drew  a  distinction\n\nbetween hearings held under 18 U.S.C.   3184 and appeals taken to\n\ncourts cloaked with the judicial power of the  United States.  In\n\ndiscussing  the former,  the  document refers  to \"the  competent\n\njudicial   authority\"   who   is   \"[i]n   the   United  States.\"\n\nSupplementary Treaty, art. 3(b); see also id. arts. 2,  3(a).  By\n                                             \n\ncontrast,  in discussing  appeals,  the treaty  refers to  United\n\nStates courts  by name.  See id. art. 3(b).  The same distinction\n                                \n\nrecurs in the legislative history.  See, e.g., S. Exec.  Rep. No.\n                                             \n\n17, supra,  at 8.    That is  a significant  datum,  for, if  the\n         \n\nlanguage of a  treaty is  at all  ambiguous, courts  may look  to\n\nlegislative   history  in   interpreting  its   provisions  under\n\nvirtually  the  same  rules  that obtain  when  courts  interpret\n\nstatutes.   See  Factor v.  Laubenheimer,  290 U.S.  276,  294-95\n                                        \n\n(1933).\n\n          The other straws in  the interpretive wind bend  in the\n\nsame  direction.   The Supplementary  Treaty stipulates  that the\n\n\"Federal  Rules of  Appellate  Procedure or  Civil Procedure,  as\n\nappropriate, shall  govern the appeals  process.\"   Supplementary\n\nTreaty,  art.   3(b).    And,  again,   the  legislative  history\n\nreinforces the point, indicating  that the disputed provision \"is\n\nnot intended to  make the Federal  rules generally applicable  to\n\nthe  extradition  hearing itself,  but only  to  the appeal  of a\n\ndecision under article 3(a).\"  S. Exec. Rep. No. 17, supra, at 8.\n                                                          \n\nIn  short, the text  of article 3(b), taken  as a whole, suggests\n\nnot only that an  appeal thereunder represents an entry  into the\n\n                                9\n\nfederal courts  but also  that extradition  proceedings involving\n\narticle 3 differ in  kind from those involving  only 18 U.S.C.   \n\n3184.\n\n          We rule, therefore, that the Supplementary Treaty marks\n\na clean break from  the ancient prohibition on direct  appeals in\n\nextradition   matters;  where   article  3  is   implicated,  the\n\nSupplementary  Treaty  contemplates at  least  one  appeal as  of\n\nright.  Accord In re  McMullen, 981 F.2d 603, 609 (2d  Cir. 1993)\n                              \n\n(en banc).  Moreover, because the Supplementary Treaty explicitly\n\nidentifies United  States courts, not judges or  justices, as the\n                                \n\nappellate authority,  see  Supplementary Treaty,  art.  3(b),  it\n                         \n\nunlocks  the  gate  which  has  historically  barred  extradition\n\nmatters from proceeding further through the federal courts in the\n\nsame manner as other cases.\n\n                     C.  Successive Appeals.\n                                           \n\n          Our jurisdictional  odyssey is  not yet ended.   Noting\n\nthat article 3(b) provides  for appeals to the district  court or\n                                                                 \n\ncourt  of  appeals,  the  government  asserted  below  that  this\n\ndisjunctive  language restricts  the parties to  one bite  of the\n\napple and rules  out successive appeals (such  as Howard essays).\n\nIn this  court, however, the government  backtracks, appearing to\n\nconcede that,  notwithstanding Howard's  earlier appeal,  we have\n\njurisdiction over this appeal.  But, since  this point implicates\n\nappellate jurisdiction and is non-frivolous,  see post (Campbell,\n                                                      \n\nJ.,  concurring),  we are  not at  liberty  simply to  accept the\n\ngovernment's concession.  See supra note 2.  We proceed to ponder\n                                   \n\n                                10\n\nthe point.\n\n          We  think  the  language  of article  3(b)  dictates  a\n\nconstruction antithetic to that which the government urged below.\n\nBecause  the Supplementary Treaty  contemplates the initiation of\n\nextradition  proceedings  before either  a  district  judge or  a\n\nmagistrate judge,  see S. Exec. Rep.  No. 17, supra, at  5, 6, 8,\n                                                   \n\narticle  3(b)  prudently provides  for  review  by the  \"district\n\ncourt, or court of appeals, as appropriate.\"  In other words, the\n\ndisjunctive  \"or\"  is  to   be  read  not  as  an   unusual,  but\n\nunderstated, restriction  on the  number of appeals;  rather, the\n                                        \n\nterm  specifies  that the  ordinary  sequence  of appeals  should\n                                             \n\napply.   This conclusion is supported by the reference in article\n\n3(b)  to the  \"appeals process,\"  as well  as by  the legislative\n\nhistory.  See S. Exec. Rep. No. 17, supra, at 8.\n                                         \n\n          We will not cart  coal to Newcastle.  Not  even so much\n\nas  a  solitary  word  or  phrase  in  the  Supplementary  Treaty\n\nintimates  an intent to prohibit  successive appeals    and it is\n\nnot   the  courts'   business  to   rewrite  a   treaty's  text.3\n\nAccordingly,  we  hold  that  article  3(b)  permits   successive\n\nappeals,  see, e.g., United States  v. Van Fossan,  899 F.2d 636,\n                                                 \n\n637-38  (7th Cir.  1990)  (holding that,  in  the absence  of  an\n\nexpress  provision prohibiting  successive appeals,  the criminal\n\nmisdemeanor  statute, 18  U.S.C.    3402  (1988), permits  them);\n\n                    \n\n     3We  appreciate  the  force  of  the  policy  considerations\nmentioned by Judge Campbell, see post (Campbell, J., concurring),\n                                     \nbut  we believe that such  matters must be  left to those charged\nwith negotiating, executing, and ratifying treaties.\n\n                                11\n\nUnited  States v.  Forcellati, 610  F.2d 25,  28 (1st  Cir. 1979)\n                             \n\n(similar),  cert.  denied,  445  U.S. 944  (1980),  to  be  given\n                         \n\nexpedited   consideration,  however,   as  article   3(b)  itself\n\nprovides, \"at every stage.\"\n\n                       D.  Recapitulation.\n                                         \n\n          To sum  up, the language and legislative history of the\n\nSupplementary Treaty make it clear that the appeal right provided\n\nby article 3(b)  implicates a \"decision[] of the  district court\"\n\nwithin the  meaning of 28  U.S.C.   1291.   In this  sense, then,\n\narticle  3(b)  breaks with  traditional  practice  by authorizing\n\ndirect appeals to the  federal courts from certain determinations\n\nregarding  extradition.    What  is more,  the  pertinent  treaty\n\nprovision  permits successive  appeals from a  magistrate judge's\n\ndecision to the  district court  and thereafter to  the court  of\n\nappeals.    Because  that   path  was  followed  here,  appellate\n\njurisdiction attaches.\n\nIV.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          Having cleared the jurisdictional hurdle, we  turn next\n\nto appellant's  asseveration that  the district court  employed a\n\nfaulty  standard of review.  Because this presents a purely legal\n\nquestion,  requiring  an   interpretation  of  the  Supplementary\n\nTreaty,  our  review is  plenary.   See,  e.g., United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nWashington,  969 F.2d 752, 754 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. 1945 (1993); Quinn, 783 F.2d at 791.\n                         \n\n                 A.  Principles Governing Review.\n                                                \n\n          Determinations concerning article 3(a)  defenses \"shall\n\n                                12\n\nbe   immediately  appealable   by  either   party\"  through   the\n\ninstrumentality of  \"filing a  notice of appeal.\"   Supplementary\n\nTreaty, art. 3(b).   But,  though this article  grants rights  of\n\nappeal,  it does  not  mention standards  of  review.   We  look,\n\ntherefore, to first principles.\n\n          Absent  a specific statutory directive to the contrary,\n\nappeals in the federal  court system are usually arrayed  along a\n\ndegree-of-deference continuum, stretching from plenary  review at\n\none  pole to  highly  deferential modes  of  review (e.g.,  clear\n                                                         \n\nerror, abuse  of discretion)  at the opposite  pole.  At  the \"no\n\ndeference\"  end   of   the  continuum   lie   appeals   involving\n\nunadulterated  questions   of  law,  the   resolution  of   which\n\ncustomarily entails de  novo review.   See, e.g., Liberty  Mutual\n                                                                 \n\nIns.  Co. v. Commercial  Union Ins. Co.,  978 F.2d  750, 757 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir.  1992).   At  the other  end  of the  continuum  lie appeals\n\ninvolving  straight factual  determinations,  the  resolution  of\n\nwhich customarily  entails acceptance of the  trier's judgment in\n\nthe  absence of  palpable error.   See,  e.g., Cumpiano  v. Banco\n                                                                 \n\nSantander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding\n                     \n\nthat appellate courts  \"ought not  to upset findings  of fact  or\n\nconclusions  drawn therefrom unless, on the  whole of the record,\n\n[the appellate judges]  form a strong,  unyielding belief that  a\n\nmistake has been made\"); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n                                 \n\n          There  are,  however,  difficulties in  classification.\n\nMany cases involve what courts term \"mixed\" questions   questions\n\nwhich, if they are to be properly resolved, necessitate combining\n\n                                13\n\nfactfinding  with  an elucidation  of  the applicable  law.   The\n\nstandard of review applicable  to mixed questions usually depends\n\nupon  where  they fall  along the  degree-of-deference continuum:\n\nthe  more fact-dominated the question, the more likely it is that\n\nthe trier's resolution of it will  be accepted unless shown to be\n\nclearly erroneous.  See, e.g., United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1150, 1158-59 (1st Cir.  1993); Roland M. v. Concord  Sch. Comm.,\n                                                                \n\n910 F.2d  983, 990-91 (1st Cir.  1990), cert. denied, 111  S.

See S.  Exec.  Rep. No.  17, supra,  at  8 (\"Nothing  in\n                                           \n\narticle 3(b) is to be interpreted as .  . . upsetting established\n\nrules  of  appellate procedure.\");  see  also  Gioiosa v.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 684 F.2d 176, 179 (1st Cir. 1982) (discussing standard of\n      \n\nreview in  appeal from  magistrate to district  court).   Because\n\nissues of the sort envisioned in article 3(a) are typically fact-\n\nspecific, appellate  review of  findings anent such  issues will,\n\nabsent  an error of law, most often proceed under the clear-error\n\nrubric.  See, e.g., Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 289-\n                                             \n\n90  (1982)   (reviewing  district   court  findings   anent  race\n\ndiscrimination  for clear  error); Beasley  v.

When a party\n\ncollaterally   challenges   a   magistrate's   determination   of\n\nextraditability, judicial review is sharply  circumscribed.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Fernandez v.

The most  prominent exception is\n      \n\nfor  a  claim  that  the  crime  constitutes  a  non-extraditable\n\npolitical offense.   Review  of political  offense determinations\n\nfollows the continuum analysis  described above.  See  Quinn, 783\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  790-91 &amp; n.9.   Because defenses under  article 3(a) are\n\nanalogous  to  political  offense  determinations    indeed,  the\n\nfundamental  compromise  undergirding  the  Supplementary  Treaty\n\ntreated the one  as a replacement  for the other    common  sense\n\nsuggests that the same standard of review should apply.\n\n          Last, but surely not least, appellant's contention that\n\ndistrict court review under  article 3(b) must always be  de novo\n                                                                 \n\nis  at war  with  the words  and  purposes of  the  Supplementary\n\nTreaty.  The  treaty expresses  a strong  interest in  expediting\n\nextradition  matters.    See  Supplementary  Treaty,  art.   3(b)\n                            \n\n                                15\n\n(providing  for  \"immediate[]\" appeals  and  requiring \"expedited\n\nconsideration at  every stage\").   The legislative history  is in\n\nthe  same  vein.    See,  e.g.,  132  Cong.  Rec.  16,607  (1986)\n                              \n\n(admonishing  that  the  treaty's  safeguards  should not  afford\n\n\"protracted sanctuary in the United States\").

As to  appellant's principal claim   that,  if extradited,\n\nhe would suffer prejudice on account of his race or nationality  \n\nwe endorse the district  court's choice of a standard  of review.\n\nThe  claim  in  question challenged  the  magistrate's underlying\n\nfactual determination  that, on  the evidence  adduced, appellant\n\nhad not proved meaningful prejudice.  This fact-intensive finding\n\nevokes clear-error review.4\n\n                    \n\n     4Since  this  is  a   successive  appeal,  we  evaluate  for\nourselves  whether  clear  error  characterized  the magistrate's\nfactual  finding that appellant failed  to prove the existence of\n\n                                16\n\n          There is, however, a second facet of appellant's claim,\n\nas  to which  the  district court  chose  the wrong  standard  of\n\nreview.    The  magistrate  held  that  article  3(a)   does  not\n\nnecessarily  bar  extradition  whenever  a  respondent shows  the\n\nexistence  of some preformed  ideas in the  requesting nation but\n\nthat  the biases  must  rise  to  a  level  where  they  actually\n\nprejudice  the respondent  before article  3(a)  affords relief.5\n\nThe soundness of this  analysis   which depends upon  whether the\n\nterms employed  in article  3(a) encompass  all nationality-based\n\nand  race-based  biases  or   only  those  directly  affecting  a\n\nparticular   respondent       involves   interpretation   of  the\n\nSupplementary Treaty.   Treaty  interpretation is a  purely legal\n\nexercise  as to which, under the criteria limned above, see supra\n                                                                 \n\nPart IV(A), no deference is  due to the trier.  Accordingly,  the\n\ndistrict court should have scrutinized the magistrate's ruling on\n\nthis issue de novo.\n                  \n\n          That the district court failed to afford plenary review\n\non this aspect of the case does not mean that we must remand.  To\n\ndo so  would needlessly throw the  helve after the hatchet.   See\n                                                                 \n\nGioiosa,  684 F.2d  at  179.   Rather,  because the  question  is\n       \n\n                    \n\ncognizable prejudice under article 3(a).  See infra Part VI.\n                                                   \n\n     5In  a second branch  of his analysis,  the magistrate found\nthat, in any event, the weight of the evidence against Howard was\nso great that  no decisionmaker  would be distracted  from it  by\nwhatever slight biases might exist.  We express no opinion on the\nappropriateness of this analytic  approach as appellant \"does not\nsuggest  that the [magistrate] was expected  to ignore the weight\nof  the  probable cause  evidence\"  in  making  his article  3(a)\ndetermination.

See, e.g., Societe  Des Produits\n                                                                 \n\nNestle,  S.A. v.

PREJUDICE UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTARY TREATY\n\n          With this  preface, we proceed directly  to the treaty-\n\ninterpretation question, affording plenary review.\n\n                    A.  Traditional Practice.\n                                            \n\n          A  sovereign's right  to obtain  the extradition  of an\n\naccused  is  created  by treaty;  where  there  is  no treaty,  a\n\nrequested nation has no duty to extradite.  See Factor, 290  U.S.\n                                                      \n\nat 287.   Indeed, federal  courts have stated  that no branch  of\n\ngovernment  has authority to  surrender an  accused to  a foreign\n\ncountry except in pursuance  of a statute or treaty.   See Quinn,\n                                                                \n\n783 F.2d at 782 (collecting cases).\n\n          An extradition  treaty does more than  bridge this gap.\n\nThe  existence of  such a  treaty between  the United  States and\n\nanother nation indicates that,  at least in a general  sense, the\n\nexecutive  and legislative branches consider the treaty partner's\n\njustice  system sufficiently  fair  to  justify  sending  accused\n\npersons there for trial.  See Glucksman  v. Henkel, 221 U.S. 508,\n                                                  \n\n512 (1911); Neely v.  Henkel (No. 1),  180 U.S. 109, 123  (1901).\n                                    \n\nIn  habeas corpus  proceedings, this  rationale has  produced the\n\nrule  of   noninquiry      a  doctrine  which   forbids  judicial\n\nauthorities  from  investigating  the  fairness  of  a requesting\n\n                                18\n\nnation's  justice  system  when  considering  whether  to  permit\n\nextradition  to that  nation.   See Glucksman,  221 U.S.  at 512;\n                                             \n\nManzi, 888 F.2d at 206 (collecting cases).6\n     \n\n          Of course, the signing of a treaty does not forever put\n\nto rest  questions concerning  the fairness of  another country's\n\nlegal framework.   For example, an extradition target may present\n\nsuch  issues to  the  Secretary  of  State     the  official  who\n\nultimately  decides whether  a  person found  to be  extraditable\n\nshould  in fact  be extradited.    See 18  U.S.C.    3186.   But,\n                                      \n\ntraditionally, in extradition cases, the  judiciary neither asks,\n\nnor  seeks  to  answer,  questions about  the  sensitivities  and\n\nsophistication of courts abroad.7\n\n                    B.  Scope of Article 3(a).\n                                             \n\n          The Supplementary Treaty openly alters this traditional\n\npractice.   It requires judges to shun extradition if the accused\n\n                    \n\n     6The government suggests that the  Constitution mandates the\nrule of noninquiry.  We disagree.  The rule did not spring from a\nbelief that courts, as an  institution, lack either the authority\nor the capacity to  evaluate foreign legal systems.   Rather, the\nrule  came   into  being  as  judges,   attempting  to  interpret\nparticular treaties, concluded that, absent a contrary indication\nin a specific instance, the ratification of an extradition treaty\nmandated  noninquiry  as a  matter of  international comity.   No\ndoubt  the  rule  exemplifies  judicial  deference  to  executive\nauthority, see Koskotas,  931 F.2d at 174, but it  is a deference\n                       \nstemming at least in part from the fact that the executive is the\nbranch which most likely has  written and negotiated the document\nbeing interpreted.\n\n     7The judiciary  has, however,  explicated a number  of other\nlimitations  on extradition.  See,  e.g., Manzi, 888  F.2d at 207\n                                               \n(explaining  that  the  principle  of  double   criminality  bars\nextradition unless  the offense is  a crime  in both  countries);\nQuinn,  783 F.2d at 792-810 (discussing origin of, and basis for,\n     \npolitical offense exception in extradition proceedings).\n\n                                19\n\neither establishes that the request \"has in fact been made with a\n\nview  to try  or punish  him on  account of  his  race, religion,\n\nnationality  or political  opinions,\"  or if  he proves  that \"he\n\nwould, if surrendered,  be prejudiced at  his trial or  punished,\n\ndetained or  restricted\"  on account  of  any of  these  factors.\n\nSupplementary Treaty, art. 3(a).  These phrases cannot be brushed\n\naside as  a series of scrivener's errors:  to the exact contrary,\n\nCongress  intended  the  words  to  authorize  inquiry  into  the\n\nattributes of  a country's  justice system  as that  system would\n\napply to a given individual.  See S. Exec. Rep. No. 17, supra, at\n                                                             \n\n4-5;  132  Cong.  Rec.  16,798-803 (1986).    Moreover,  Congress\n\nevidently  knew that  its command  reversed years  of extradition\n\npractice forbidding judicial investigation  into such areas.  See\n                                                                 \n\n132  Cong. Rec. 16,800 (1986) (describing article 3(a) as \"a very\n\nbroad,  and far  reaching provision\");  id. at  16,806 (labelling\n                                           \n\nthis aspect of the treaty \"historic\").  \n\n          Still, the article  3(a) defense,  though a  refreshing\n\nzephyr  to persons  resisting  extradition, is  not of  hurricane\n\nforce;  its mere invocation will  not sweep aside  all notions of\n\ninternational comity  and deference  to  the requesting  nation's\n\nsovereignty.    At least  four principles  rein  in the  winds of\n\nchange.  First, elementary rules of construction dictate that the\n\ndefense  not  be  construed  so  expansively  as  to  negate  the\n\nremainder of the treaty.   See, e.g., Factor, 290 U.S. at 292-93.\n                                            \n\nThe  rule  of noninquiry  developed from  the assumption  that an\n\nextradition treaty, by its  very existence, constitutes a general\n\n                                20\n\nacceptance  of another  country's legal system.   See  supra Part\n                                                            \n\nV(A).  By like  token, the existence of  an overall agreement  on\n\nextradition must inform the workings of the article 3(a) defense,\n\nlimiting  its applicability to  specific problems  encountered by\n\nspecific respondents, as opposed to general grievances concerning\n\nsystemic  weaknesses  inherent in  every  case.   Otherwise,  the\n\nextradition treaty actually becomes an impediment to extradition,\n\nin other words,  a non-extradition  treaty.  See  132 Cong.  Rec.\n                                                \n\n16,607 (1986).\n\n          Second,  controlling  precedent  requires  that,  where\n\npossible,   we   interpret   extradition   treaties   to  produce\n\nreciprocity  between,  and  expanded  rights on  behalf  of,  the\n\nsignatories:\n\n          [Treaties] should be  liberally construed  so\n          as  to effect the  apparent intention  of the\n          parties  to  secure equality  and reciprocity\n          between them.   For that reason,  if a treaty\n          fairly  admits  of  two   constructions,  one\n          restricting the  rights which may  be claimed\n          under  it,  and the  other enlarging  it, the\n          more liberal construction is to be preferred.\n\nFactor,  290 U.S. at 293-94.  These principles of reciprocity and\n      \n\nliberal  construction  have  particular force  here  because  the\n\nUnited  States, unlike the U.K. and certain other nations, has no\n\navailable  machinery  for  prosecuting  those  who commit  crimes\n\nabroad but who are, nonetheless, non-extraditable.  See 132 Cong.\n                                                       \n\nRec. 16,587 (1986).\n\n          Third, article  3(a) requires  an accused to  establish\n\nthat  he would,  if  surrendered, be  \"prejudiced\" on  account of\n\nparticular factors.   In our  view, this word  denotes that  only\n\n                                21\n\nthose preformed ideas relative to race, nationality, and the like\n\nwhich  are  of  sufficient   magnitude  actually  to  affect  the\n\naccused's  situation,  i.e.,  to  \"prejudice\"  him,  trigger  the\n                           \n\nspecial prophylactic protections of the Supplementary Treaty.\n\n          Finally,  the  legislative  history  suggests  that, in\n\ninsisting upon  the inclusion  of article  3(a),  the Senate  was\n\nconcerned  largely   with  the   special  Diplock  court   system\n\napplicable  to  those  accused  of  terrorist  acts  in  Northern\n\nIreland.   See 132  Cong.  Rec. 16,806-19  (1986).   There is  no\n              \n\nindication that the defense was meant  as a slur upon, much  less\n\nan indictment of, the British legal system.\n\n          For these  four reasons, we  conclude that the  soil of\n\nthis  case   is   particularly   inhospitable   to   a   rambling\n\ninterpretation  of article 3(a).   We  hold, therefore,  that, in\n\norder  to  avail  himself   of  the  article  3(a)  defense,   an\n\nextradition  target  must establish  by  a  preponderance of  the\n\ncredible  evidence that, if he were surrendered, the legal system\n\nof the requesting country would  treat him differently from other\n\nsimilarly  situated individuals  because  of his  race, religion,\n\nnationality, or political opinions.   It is not enough  simply to\n\nshow some  possibility that preformed ideas  might exist; rather,\n\nunder the terms of  the Supplementary Treaty, the bias  must rise\n\nto the level of  prejudicing the accused.  See  generally William\n                                                         \n\nM.  Hannay,  Committee  Report:   An  Analysis  of  the U.S.-U.K.\n                                                                 \n\nSupplementary Extradition Treaty, 21 Int'l Law. 925 (1987).\n                                \n\n           C.  Appellant's \"Per Se Prejudice\" Argument.\n                                                      \n\n                                22\n\n          We now face the task of applying the prejudice standard\n\nin  this case.    The record  reveals  that the  magistrate  paid\n\ncareful  attention to an array of facts that sometimes pointed in\n\ndifferent directions.   For  instance, he  found that there  were\n\nsome negative articles about Howard,  that some Britons might  be\n\nbiased  against  black  Americans, and  that  the  U.K.  does not\n\nutilize   a  voir   dire  procedure   to   screen  venirepersons.\n\nNonetheless,  in  the  magistrate's  eyes, these  facts  did  not\n\nestablish   an  article   3(a)  defense   because  countervailing\n\nconsiderations  mitigated  their negative  impact,  rendering any\n\nbias de minimis.   Appellant excoriates this finding, complaining\n               \n\nthat  it rests  upon a  faulty  legal premise.   He  asserts that\n\narticle  3 effectively eclipses the  rule of noninquiry; that the\n\nevidence he tendered constitutes per se proof  of prejudice which\n                                       \n\nirrebuttably establishes  an article  3(a) defense; and  that the\n\nSupplementary   Treaty  does  not  countenance  consideration  of\n\ncountervailing factors  in mulling  whether a defense  is extant.\n\nWe  concur  with the  magistrate  that  the Supplementary  Treaty\n\nstakes out a middle ground between the classic rule of noninquiry\n\nand  the total  abolition of that  rule:   the treaty  alters the\n\ntraditional   formulation  of   the  rule   while  simultaneously\n\npreserving many aspects  of it.   Any other interpretation  would\n\nrun afoul of the four constraining principles we have identified.\n\nSee supra at 20-21.\n         \n\n          One  manifestation  of  this  middle  position is  that\n\narticle  3(a),  as we  read it,  imposes  a de  minimis threshold\n                                                       \n\n                                23\n\nrequirement relative to the existence of prejudice.  For example,\n\nbecause  international  criminal  affairs  are   frequently  high\n\nprofile, a  per se rule  barring extradition  whenever there  has\n                  \n\nbeen any negative  publicity would undermine the entire treaty by\n\nmaking successful  article 3(a) defenses  virtually automatic and\n\nrelegating  extradition to  a few  fringe instances.   We  do not\n\nthink that the treaty partners intended so unproductive a result.\n\nSimilar reasoning rules out any per se prohibition on extradition\n                                      \n\nwhen  the accused  proffers evidence  suggesting discordant  race\n\nrelations in the U.K. or when he simply points to  the absence of\n\na specific procedural device.\n\n          Consequently,   we  hold   that,  while   a  magistrate\n\nconsidering the applicability  of article 3(a) must weigh each of\n\nthe  factors cited by  appellant if an  extradition target offers\n\nproof that  they exist, their  mere presence, without  more, does\n\nnot  conclusively  establish  an  article  3(a)  defense.8    The\n\nsomething \"more,\"  as  we have  indicated,  is prejudice  to  the\n\n                    \n\n     8This interpretation finds  analogies in prevailing  federal\ncourt  practice.  For instance,  we have routinely  held that the\nmere  presence   of   differing  procedural   devices,   pretrial\npublicity, or allegations  of community prejudice, without  more,\ndoes  not warrant overturning a criminal  conviction.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \nNeron v.  Tierney, 841  F.2d 1197, 1199  (1st Cir.)  (admonishing\n                 \nagainst  the   use  of  habeas  corpus   to  superimpose  federal\nprocedural choices  upon state courts merely  because the federal\ncourt  thinks some  \"other\" procedure  might be  \"better\"), cert.\n                                                                 \ndenied, 488  U.S. 832 (1988); United  States v.

Gullion, 575 F.2d 26,\n                                                   \n28  (1st  Cir.  1978)  (explaining  that  the  mere existence  of\ncommunity  prejudice,  in and  of  itself,  does not  necessitate\nrelief).\n\n                                24\n\nextradition  target.   It follows  that the  magistrate correctly\n\nconstrued  article   3(a)  to   require  a  showing   of  actual,\n\nrespondent-specific prejudice.9  Appellant's per  se challenge to\n                                                    \n\nthe magistrate's reasoning must, therefore, fail.\n\nVI.  THE MERITS OF THE ARTICLE 3(a) DEFENSE\n\n          This  brings us  to the  merits of  Howard's fact-based\n\nchallenge to  the decision below     an issue that  gives us some\n\npause.10   Nevertheless,  in seeking  to  secure an  article 3(a)\n\ndefense, an extradition  target bears  a heavy burden.   He  must\n\nestablish,  by a preponderance of the evidence, that he would, if\n                                                             \n\nsurrendered,  be prejudiced  on account  of a  proscribed factor.\n\nSee  Supplementary Treaty,  art.  3(a); see  also 132  Cong. Rec.\n                                                 \n\n16,607  (1986).  Having painstakingly  reviewed the papers in the\n\ncase in  light of the burden  of proof, we cannot  say that clear\n\nerror inheres.\n\n          Appellant   introduced  numerous   newspaper  articles,\n\naffidavits from several  people living in Great Britain,  and the\n\ntestimony  of  Paul  Stevenson,  a senior  executive  officer  of\n\nEngland's  Commission  for  Racial  Equality, in  an  attempt  to\n\n                    \n\n     9We  note, in  passing,  that the  rules governing  criminal\ntrials  in the federal courts  seem fully compatible  with such a\nrequirement.   See,  e.g., Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 52(a)  (\"Any error,\n                         \ndefect,   irregularity  or   variance   which  does   not  affect\nsubstantial rights shall be disregarded.\").\n\n     10We refer only to appellant's claim that, if extradited, he\nwould be prejudiced on account of his race.  He presented little,\nif  any, evidence suggesting  the existence  of nationality-based\nbiases in this  case, and we  cannot discern any error  (clear or\notherwise) in  the magistrate's finding that  appellant failed to\nprove cognizable prejudice of this genre.\n\n                                25\n\nestablish  that  widespread  publicity  would  prevent  him  from\n\nreceiving fair treatment abroad.   But, this evidence comprises a\n\nmixed bag.  It is true that some of the press clippings contained\n\nracial innuendo.  On the other hand, the publicity was mercifully\n\nbrief in  duration, for the most  part lasting less than  a week;\n\nthe U.K.'s  Contempt of Court  Act has been invoked  and will cut\n\noff  any  further  untoward publicity;  Howard's  counsel himself\n\ncreated  some  of the  notoriety in  his  rousing remarks  to the\n\nBritish  press;   the  media   coverage  was  not   uniformly  or\n\noverwhelmingly negative (indeed,  some of the newspaper  articles\n\ndescribe  appellant  favorably);  and,  finally,   the  publicity\n\noccurred over two years ago and will be very old news when and if\n\nappellant  eventually  comes  to  trial  in  England.    On  this\n\nconflicted record, the magistrate  did not perpetrate clear error\n\nin finding  that a spurt  of mixed publicity  created in part  by\n\nappellant's counsel and occurring years ago failed to rise to the\n\nlevel of prejudice necessary to sustain an article 3(a) defense.\n\n          The evidence  in  the record  concerning  the  supposed\n\nshortcomings  of the  requesting nation's  legal system  does not\n\nrequire  a different result for  it, too, is  mixed.  Admittedly,\n\nappellant  presented  affidavits  and testimony  suggesting  that\n\npreformed   ideas  constitute   a   particular   threat  in   the\n\ncircumstances  of this case  because the English  system does not\n\nprovide for American-style voir  dire of potential jurors.   But,\n\nevidence  submitted   by   the  government   and  elicited   from\n\nappellant's  witness  on  cross-examination  indicates  that  the\n\n                                26\n\nEnglish legal system has a host of other mechanisms which will be\n\navailable to  appellant and  which mitigate  the absence  of voir\n\ndire.  Appellant will be able to present his arguments concerning\n\nthe  impact  of  pretrial  publicity and  race  relations  during\n\ncommittal  proceedings in  the  U.K.    He  may  then  renew  the\n\narguments by requesting pretrial review at the Crown Court, again\n\nbefore  the trial  judge,  and still  again  on appeal  from  any\n\nconviction.  In  addition, the English system provides  for self-\n\nexcusal of  potentially biased jurors  and trial judges  are duty\n\nbound  to  offer   detailed  jury  instructions  concerning   the\n\nimpropriety  of grounding  defendants' convictions  on extraneous\n\nconsiderations.  Seen in this light, the absence of voir dire  in\n\nthe  English system is not of decretory significance.  After all,\n\ncourts must not let jingoism  run amok, but, rather, must turn  a\n\nsympathetic ear to other nations' independent judgments about how\n\nbest  to ensure fairness in  dealing with criminal  matters.  The\n\nUnited States has no monopoly on even-handed justice.\n\n          To  summarize,  the   evidence  concerning   prejudice,\n\nproperly decanted, is ambivalent.  The facts we have  catalogued,\n\nand  others in  the  record, comprise  adequate  support for  the\n\nmagistrate's  conclusion that  any evidence  of bias  relating to\n\nappellant's race is so  exiguous as not to animate  article 3(a).\n\nPut  another way, the magistrate weighed the proof, drew a series\n\nof  reasonable (albeit  not inevitable)  inferences from  it, and\n\nconcluded that appellant  had not carried  the burden of  proving\n\nprejudice.   We cannot say that this choice between two plausible\n\n                                27\n\nalternatives,  each  of  which   finds  support  in  the  record,\n\nconstitutes  clear error.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,\n                                                                \n\n470 U.S. 564, 573-74  (1985); United States v. Rodriguez-Morales,\n                                                                \n\n929  F.2d 780, 784 (1st Cir. 1991),  cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 868\n                                                 \n\n(1992).\n\nVII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need  go   no  further.11     Article   3  of   the\n\nSupplementary   Treaty  significantly   alters  the   pattern  of\n\nprocedural avenues and substantive rights traditionally available\n\nin extradition  cases.   While these alterations  reconfigure the\n\nextradition   landscape,  they  do   not  render  it  impassable.\n\nFollowing  the map that Article  3 supplies, we  conclude that we\n\nhave  jurisdiction  to  consider  appellant's  claims;  that  the\n\nstandard of review governing his legal challenge is de novo; that\n                                                           \n\nthe standard  of review governing his fact-based challenge is for\n\nclear error; that  appellant's arguments anent  the scope of  the\n\narticle 3(a) defense  envision a grandeur which lacks  support in\n\nthe treaty's language or in the applicable law; and, that, in the\n\nlast analysis,  the magistrate's  findings of fact  derive enough\n\nsupport from  the record to  withstand attack.   Accordingly, the\n\n                    \n\n     11We do  not tarry  over the assertion  that the  magistrate\nerred  in denying appellant's motions  to stay proceedings and to\nsupplement the  evidence.   These motions  were addressed  to the\nmagistrate's discretion, and he  provided ample reasons for their\ndenial.   In the same vein,  we see no error  in the magistrate's\ndiscretionary   decision   allowing   the  government   to   file\nconfirmatory  materials  out  of  time.     On  this  score,  the\nsockdolager is that appellant neither sought to reopen the record\nto  counter  or  contest  the  belated  evidentiary  proffer  nor\nrequested time for this specific purpose.  He cannot now be heard\nto complain that he had no chance to respond.\n\n                                28\n\ndistrict  court lawfully  upheld the  magistrate's issuance  of a\n\ncertification of extraditability.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    Concurring Opinion Follows  \n\n                                29\n\n            CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge (Concurring).  While\n                                                       \n\n  joining  in  the  court's  opinion,  I  am  troubled  by  our\n\n  resolution of  the \"successive appeals\" issue.   Article 3(b)\n\n  provides that  a finding concerning an  Article 3(a) defense,\n\n  involving race, religion, nationality, or  political opinion,\n\n  \"shall  be  immediately appealable  by  either  party to  the\n\n  United  States  district  court,  or  court  of  appeals,  as\n\n  appropriate.\"   We hold  that this unclear  language does not\n\n  indicate that  an appellant receives only one appeal    i.e.,\n                                               \n\n  an appeal to the  district court, if the  initial extradition\n\n  decision was  by a magistrate, or  an appeal to the  court of\n                                   \n\n  appeals if the initial extradition decision was by a district\n\n  judge     but rather was meant to  provide, however clumsily,\n\n  for  the full federal appellate process.  Thus, where as here\n\n  the  initial  extradition  decision  was by  the  magistrate,\n\n  appellant  can  appeal, (1)  to  the  United States  district\n\n  court; (2) from  the  district court  to this  court; and,  I\n\n  assume, (3) from  this court to the Supreme  Court by writ of\n\n  certiorari.\n\n            It  is sad but true that this interpretation of the\n\n  ambiguous language     while  seemingly what was  intended   \n\n  creates significant new  opportunities for  persons to  delay\n\n  their extradition.  Historically, extradition decisions  by a\n\n  judge or  magistrate were  not appealable, thus  avoiding the\n\n  potential  delays  which   often  attend  appellate   review.\n\n                               -29-\n                                29\n\n  Obviously,  the  more  extradition  is susceptible  to  being\n\n  bogged  down in endless  procedural maneuvering,  the greater\n\n  the danger that essential witnesses  to the charged crime may\n\n  die or disappear and their memories fade prior to trial.   It\n\n  used to  be thought  that the  interest of  another civilized\n\n  nation  in enforcing  its  criminal law  entitled  it to  the\n\n  reasonably  prompt  extradition  of  accused  persons.    The\n\n  present appeal to this court  has enabled appellant to  delay\n\n  trial in Great Britain by another year or more.\n\n            It would have been useful had  the United States of\n\n  America gone more deeply,  in its briefs before us,  into the\n\n  pros and cons  of the proper interpretation  of Article 3(b).\n\n  In  a Treaty  case  of first  impression, the  interpretation\n\n  espoused by  the Attorney  General can  be enlightening.   As\n\n  best I can tell, the Attorney General agrees with the court's\n                                              \n\n  reading of the  Treaty, i.e., that the full federal appellate\n\n  process, and not a truncated version, was intended.  However,\n\n  the alternative interpretation    what my colleagues call the\n\n  \"one bite of the  apple\" approach     has  some appeal  given\n\n  Article  3(b)'s  literal  language  and  the  long  tradition\n\n  divorcing extradition from the  normal appellate process.  We\n\n  could have  benefited from  a more considered  explication of\n\n  all this by the United States.\n\n            In  any  event,  I  write separately  in  order  to\n\n  emphasize  the  implications  of  Article  3(b),  as  we  now\n\n                               -30-\n                                30\n\n  interpret it, so that the drafters  of future provisions will\n\n  have no  illusions  concerning the  inevitable potential  for\n\n  delay,  and  may decide  whether  other  approaches would  be\n\n  desirable.\n\n                               -31-\n                                31\n",

We must determine,\n\ninter  alia, (1)  whether, under  the treaty,  the second  of two\n           \n\nsuccessive  appeals from  a certification  of  extraditability is\n\nwithin our  jurisdiction;  (2) if  so,  what standard  of  review\n\ngoverns such appeals; (3) whether the treaty alters the venerable\n\nrule  of  noninquiry; and  (4)  if  so, to  what  extent.   After\n\ngrappling with  these, and other, matters,  we eventually address\n\nthe merits of the  appeal and conclude that the  determination of\n\nextraditability must stand.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The seeds of  this appeal  were sown on  June 1,  1991,\n\nwhen  a  policeman discovered  the  mutilated  body of  Catherine\n\nElizabeth Ayling, a young white female, in the trunk  of a rental\n\ncar  abandoned   at   England's  Gatwick   Airport.     Suspicion\n\nimmediately  centered  on   respondent-appellant  Curtis   Andrew\n\nHoward,  a  United  States  citizen.    Charges  were  preferred.\n\nBecause  Howard   had  returned  to  his   native  land,  British\n\nauthorities sought to extradite him.  On June 5, 1991, the United\n\nStates Attorney  for the District of  Massachusetts requested and\n\nreceived from a federal  magistrate judge a warrant for  Howard's\n\nprovisional arrest.  See 18 U.S.C.   3184 (1988 &amp; Supp. II 1990);\n                        \n\nD. Mass. Loc. Mag. R. 1(e).  Howard was apprehended.  He appeared\n\n                                2\n\nfor  an  extradition  hearing  before  the  magistrate  judge  on\n\nSeptember 10, 1991.\n\n          At the hearing Howard did not dispute the  existence of\n\nprobable cause  to  believe  he had  murdered  Ayling.    Rather,\n\nHoward, who is black,  argued that he would be  prejudiced during\n\nlegal  proceedings  in  the  U.K.  by  reason  of  his  race  and\n\nnationality, a circumstance which, if true, constituted a defense\n\nto  extradition under  the  relevant treaty.   See  Supplementary\n                                                  \n\nExtradition  Treaty,   June  25,  1985,  U.S.-U.K.,   art.  3(a),\n\nreprinted in  S. Exec.  Rep. No. 17,  99th Cong., 2d  Sess. 15-17\n            \n\n(1986)  (Supplementary  Treaty).   In  support  of this  defense,\n\nHoward proffered evidence of flamboyant publicity surrounding his\n\ncase,  sought to  show that  Britons would  likely  be prejudiced\n\nagainst blacks    particularly  those accused of  murdering young\n\nwhite  females   and pointed out that England's legal system does\n\nnot  make  any provision  for  voir dire  of  prospective jurors.\n\nThese proffers did  not sufficiently impress the magistrate:   he\n\nruled  that  Howard  had  not  established  a  valid  defense  to\n\nextradition   and   thereupon    issued   a   certification    of\n\nextraditability, together with  an order of commitment.1   See 18\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.   3184.\n\n                    \n\n     1The magistrate  found that  all the basic  prerequisites to\nextradition  had been fulfilled in that the United States and the\nU.K. are parties to  an extradition treaty; a criminal  charge is\npending against Howard  in the  U.K.; the charged  offense is  an\nextraditable crime  under the treaty;  the person charged  is the\nsame  person  whom the  government  wants  extradited; an  arrest\nwarrant is outstanding; and probable cause exists to believe that\nHoward committed the crime.  None of these findings are contested\non appeal.\n\n                                3\n\n          Howard   appealed.     The  district   court  exercised\n\njurisdiction, reviewed the magistrate's findings for clear error,\n\nand affirmed.  See In re Howard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1503922\"><a href=\"/opinion/1503922/matter-of-extradition-of-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Mass. 1992).\n                               \n\nHoward appeals anew.\n\nII.  THE SUPPLEMENTARY TREATY\n\n          Because the Supplementary  Treaty departs from accepted\n\nextradition protocol, we trace its origins  and spotlight its key\n\nprovisions.\n\n          In 1972, the United States  and the U.K. negotiated new\n\nterms   governing  reciprocal   extradition  from   one  nation's\n\nterritory  of persons  accused or  convicted of  certain offenses\n\ncommitted in the other  nation.  See Extradition Treaty,  June 8,\n                                    \n\n1972, U.S.-U.K., art. I,  28 U.S.T. 227, 229 (Treaty).  Under the\n\nTreaty, murder was an extraditable offense.  See id. art. III(1).\n                                                    \n\nNonetheless, the Treaty allowed a signatory to refuse extradition\n\nif it regarded  the offense  \"as one of  a political  character.\"\n\nId.  art. V(c)(i).  This exception sired friction between the two\n   \n\ntraditional allies when federal judges in the United States began\n\ninterpreting it to bar extradition of members of the  Provisional\n\nIrish Republican  Army.

(1985).\n                             \n\nFollowing  many months  of  strident debate,  the opposing  camps\n\nreached  a compromise,  placing  most violent  crimes beyond  the\n\npolitical  offense exception's  reach  but  adding certain  novel\n\nsafeguards for the  protection of potential extraditees.   See S.\n                                                              \n\nExec. Rep. No. 17, supra, at  4-5.  On July 17, 1986, the  Senate\n                        \n\nratified the  proposed treaty subject  to the addition  of these,\n\nand  other,  amendments.    See  132  Cong.  Rec. 16,819  (1986).\n                               \n\nFollowing approval  of  the  modified version  by  the  House  of\n\nCommons, instruments of ratification  were exchanged on  December\n\n23, 1986.  See  Supplementary Treaty, supra, reprinted at  Hein's\n                                                         \n\nNo. KAV 2053; see also I.I. Kavass et al., Extradition:  Laws and\n                                                                 \n\nTreaties  920.20d-h  (1979 &amp;  Supp. 1989).    At that  point, the\n        \n\nSupplementary Treaty went into force.\n\n          An aspect  of the Senate-forged compromise  lies at the\n\ncore  of the instant case.  As ratified, the Supplementary Treaty\n\nprohibits  extradition \"if the person sought establishes . . . by\n\na preponderance of evidence that . .  . he would, if surrendered,\n\nbe prejudiced at his trial or punished, detained or restricted in\n\nhis   personal  liberty   by  reason   of  his   race,  religion,\n\nnationality, or political opinions.\"  Supplementary  Treaty, art.\n\n3(a).  Appellant's case rests squarely upon this proviso.\n\n                                5\n\nIII.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n          The  Supplementary Treaty  stipulates that  the trier's\n\nfindings with regard to an article 3(a) defense  are \"immediately\n\nappealable  by either party to  the United States district court,\n\nor  court of  appeals,  as appropriate.\"   Id.  art.  3(b).   The\n                                              \n\ninitial question that commands  our attention concerns the extent\n\nof our jurisdiction under  this provision.

The government\n\nargues the inverse, imploring that  neither the President nor the\n\nSenate intended to  work so  abrupt a tergiversation.   We  agree\n\nwith appellant that the Supplementary Treaty, which has the force\n\nof  law, U.S.  Const. art.  VI, cl.  2, effects  a sea  change in\n\nestablished policy.\n\n          The Supplementary  Treaty provides that a finding anent\n\na  so-called  article  3(a) defense,  involving  race,  religion,\n\nnationality,   or  political   opinion,  \"shall   be  immediately\n\nappealable by either  party to the United States  district court,\n\nor court of appeals, as appropriate.\"  Supplementary Treaty, art.\n\n3(b).  This appeal provision, which apparently finds its  genesis\n\nin an earlier (failed) attempt  to alter the protocol prohibiting\n\ndirect appeals in extradition matters, see 132 Cong.

See Sumitomo  Shoji America,  Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nAvagliano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110740\"><a href=\"/opinion/110740/sumitomo-shoji-america-inc-v-avagliano/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  180 (1982) (explaining that a  treaty's\n         \n\nliteral language must be given effect unless patently contrary to\n\nthe signatories'  intentions and expectations).

That is  a significant  datum,  for, if  the\n         \n\nlanguage of a  treaty is  at all  ambiguous, courts  may look  to\n\nlegislative   history  in   interpreting  its   provisions  under\n\nvirtually  the  same  rules  that obtain  when  courts  interpret\n\nstatutes.

And,  again,   the  legislative  history\n\nreinforces the point, indicating  that the disputed provision \"is\n\nnot intended to  make the Federal  rules generally applicable  to\n\nthe  extradition  hearing itself,  but only  to  the appeal  of a\n\ndecision under article 3(a).\"  S.

But, since  this point implicates\n\nappellate jurisdiction and is non-frivolous,  see post (Campbell,\n                                                      \n\nJ.,  concurring),  we are  not at  liberty  simply to  accept the\n\ngovernment's concession.

No. 17, supra, at  5, 6, 8,\n                                                   \n\narticle  3(b)  prudently provides  for  review  by the  \"district\n\ncourt, or court of appeals, as appropriate.\"  In other words, the\n\ndisjunctive  \"or\"  is  to   be  read  not  as  an   unusual,  but\n\nunderstated, restriction  on the  number of appeals;  rather, the\n                                        \n\nterm  specifies  that the  ordinary  sequence  of appeals  should\n                                             \n\napply.   This conclusion is supported by the reference in article\n\n3(b)  to the  \"appeals process,\"  as well  as by  the legislative\n\nhistory.  See S. Exec. Rep. No. 17, supra, at 8.\n                                         \n\n          We will not cart  coal to Newcastle.  Not  even so much\n\nas  a  solitary  word  or  phrase  in  the  Supplementary  Treaty\n\nintimates  an intent to prohibit  successive appeals    and it is\n\nnot   the  courts'   business  to   rewrite  a   treaty's  text.3\n\nAccordingly,  we  hold  that  article  3(b)  permits   successive\n\nappeals,  see, e.g., United States  v.

In this  sense, then,\n\narticle  3(b)  breaks with  traditional  practice  by authorizing\n\ndirect appeals to the  federal courts from certain determinations\n\nregarding  extradition.    What  is more,  the  pertinent  treaty\n\nprovision  permits successive  appeals from a  magistrate judge's\n\ndecision to the  district court  and thereafter to  the court  of\n\nappeals.

But,  though this article  grants rights  of\n\nappeal,  it does  not  mention standards  of  review.   We  look,\n\ntherefore, to first principles.\n\n          Absent  a specific statutory directive to the contrary,\n\nappeals in the federal  court system are usually arrayed  along a\n\ndegree-of-deference continuum, stretching from plenary  review at\n\none  pole to  highly  deferential modes  of  review (e.g.,  clear\n                                                         \n\nerror, abuse  of discretion)  at the opposite  pole.  At  the \"no\n\ndeference\"  end   of   the  continuum   lie   appeals   involving\n\nunadulterated  questions   of  law,  the   resolution  of   which\n\ncustomarily entails de  novo review.   See, e.g., Liberty  Mutual\n                                                                 \n\nIns.  Co. v. Commercial  Union Ins.

At  the other  end  of the  continuum  lie appeals\n\ninvolving  straight factual  determinations,  the  resolution  of\n\nwhich customarily  entails acceptance of the  trier's judgment in\n\nthe  absence of  palpable error.

The most  prominent exception is\n      \n\nfor  a  claim  that  the  crime  constitutes  a  non-extraditable\n\npolitical offense.   Review  of political  offense determinations\n\nfollows the continuum analysis  described above.  See  Quinn, 783\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  790-91 &amp; n.9.   Because defenses under  article 3(a) are\n\nanalogous  to  political  offense  determinations    indeed,  the\n\nfundamental  compromise  undergirding  the  Supplementary  Treaty\n\ntreated the one  as a replacement  for the other    common  sense\n\nsuggests that the same standard of review should apply.\n\n          Last, but surely not least, appellant's contention that\n\ndistrict court review under  article 3(b) must always be  de novo\n                                                                 \n\nis  at war  with  the words  and  purposes of  the  Supplementary\n\nTreaty.  The  treaty expresses  a strong  interest in  expediting\n\nextradition  matters.    See  Supplementary  Treaty,  art.   3(b)\n                            \n\n                                15\n\n(providing  for  \"immediate[]\" appeals  and  requiring \"expedited\n\nconsideration at  every stage\").   The legislative history  is in\n\nthe  same  vein.    See,  e.g.,  132  Cong.  Rec.  16,607  (1986)\n                              \n\n(admonishing  that  the  treaty's  safeguards  should not  afford\n\n\"protracted sanctuary in the United States\").   Wholesale de novo\n                                                                 \n\nreview not  only would  ignore the factfinder's  superior vantage\n\npoint  for judging the intricacies  of a contested  case but also\n\nwould  be   wasteful,  engendering  unwarranted  delays   in  the\n\nextradition process.\n\n          In  general,  then, reviewing  courts should  apply the\n\nclearly erroneous  standard to  the trier's  findings of  fact in\n\nsituations  where article  3  of the  Supplementary Treaty  is in\n\nplay.\n\n                   B.  Applying the Principles.\n                                              \n\n          In   this  case,   the  district   court  treated   the\n\nmagistrate's  finding that  no  cognizable  article 3(a)  defense\n\nexisted  as factual in  nature and applied  the clearly erroneous\n\ntest.  As to  appellant's principal claim   that,  if extradited,\n\nhe would suffer prejudice on account of his race or nationality  \n\nwe endorse the district  court's choice of a standard  of review.\n\nThe  claim  in  question challenged  the  magistrate's underlying\n\nfactual determination  that, on  the evidence  adduced, appellant\n\nhad not proved meaningful prejudice.  This fact-intensive finding\n\nevokes clear-error review.4\n\n                    \n\n     4Since  this  is  a   successive  appeal,  we  evaluate  for\nourselves  whether  clear  error  characterized  the magistrate's\nfactual  finding that appellant failed  to prove the existence of\n\n                                16\n\n          There is, however, a second facet of appellant's claim,\n\nas  to which  the  district court  chose  the wrong  standard  of\n\nreview.    The  magistrate  held  that  article  3(a)   does  not\n\nnecessarily  bar  extradition  whenever  a  respondent shows  the\n\nexistence  of some preformed  ideas in the  requesting nation but\n\nthat  the biases  must  rise  to  a  level  where  they  actually\n\nprejudice  the respondent  before article  3(a)  affords relief.5\n\nThe soundness of this  analysis   which depends upon  whether the\n\nterms employed  in article  3(a) encompass  all nationality-based\n\nand  race-based  biases  or   only  those  directly  affecting  a\n\nparticular   respondent       involves   interpretation   of  the\n\nSupplementary Treaty.

PREJUDICE UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTARY TREATY\n\n          With this  preface, we proceed directly  to the treaty-\n\ninterpretation question, affording plenary review.\n\n                    A.  Traditional Practice.\n                                            \n\n          A  sovereign's right  to obtain  the extradition  of an\n\naccused  is  created  by treaty;  where  there  is  no treaty,  a\n\nrequested nation has no duty to extradite.  See Factor, 290  U.S.\n                                                      \n\nat 287.   Indeed, federal  courts have stated  that no branch  of\n\ngovernment  has authority to  surrender an  accused to  a foreign\n\ncountry except in pursuance  of a statute or treaty.   See Quinn,\n                                                                \n\n783 F.2d at 782 (collecting cases).\n\n          An extradition  treaty does more than  bridge this gap.\n\nThe  existence of  such a  treaty between  the United  States and\n\nanother nation indicates that,  at least in a general  sense, the\n\nexecutive  and legislative branches consider the treaty partner's\n\njustice  system sufficiently  fair  to  justify  sending  accused\n\npersons there for trial.

See Glucksman,  221 U.S.  at 512;\n                                             \n\nManzi, 888 F.2d at 206 (collecting cases).6\n     \n\n          Of course, the signing of a treaty does not forever put\n\nto rest  questions concerning  the fairness of  another country's\n\nlegal framework.   For example, an extradition target may present\n\nsuch  issues to  the  Secretary  of  State     the  official  who\n\nultimately  decides whether  a  person found  to be  extraditable\n\nshould  in fact  be extradited.    See 18  U.S.C.    3186.   But,\n                                      \n\ntraditionally, in extradition cases, the  judiciary neither asks,\n\nnor  seeks  to  answer,  questions about  the  sensitivities  and\n\nsophistication of courts abroad.7\n\n                    B.  Scope of Article 3(a).\n                                             \n\n          The Supplementary Treaty openly alters this traditional\n\npractice.   It requires judges to shun extradition if the accused\n\n                    \n\n     6The government suggests that the  Constitution mandates the\nrule of noninquiry.  We disagree.  The rule did not spring from a\nbelief that courts, as an  institution, lack either the authority\nor the capacity to  evaluate foreign legal systems.   Rather, the\nrule  came   into  being  as  judges,   attempting  to  interpret\nparticular treaties, concluded that, absent a contrary indication\nin a specific instance, the ratification of an extradition treaty\nmandated  noninquiry  as a  matter of  international comity.   No\ndoubt  the  rule  exemplifies  judicial  deference  to  executive\nauthority, see Koskotas,  931 F.2d at 174, but it  is a deference\n                       \nstemming at least in part from the fact that the executive is the\nbranch which most likely has  written and negotiated the document\nbeing interpreted.\n\n     7The judiciary  has, however,  explicated a number  of other\nlimitations  on extradition.  See,  e.g., Manzi, 888  F.2d at 207\n                                               \n(explaining  that  the  principle  of  double   criminality  bars\nextradition unless  the offense is  a crime  in both  countries);\nQuinn,  783 F.2d at 792-810 (discussing origin of, and basis for,\n     \npolitical offense exception in extradition proceedings).\n\n                                19\n\neither establishes that the request \"has in fact been made with a\n\nview  to try  or punish  him on  account of  his  race, religion,\n\nnationality  or political  opinions,\"  or if  he proves  that \"he\n\nwould, if surrendered,  be prejudiced at  his trial or  punished,\n\ndetained or  restricted\"  on account  of  any of  these  factors.\n\nSupplementary Treaty, art. 3(a).  These phrases cannot be brushed\n\naside as  a series of scrivener's errors:  to the exact contrary,\n\nCongress  intended  the  words  to  authorize  inquiry  into  the\n\nattributes of  a country's  justice system  as that  system would\n\napply to a given individual.  See S. Exec. Rep. No. 17, supra, at\n                                                             \n\n4-5;  132  Cong.  Rec.  16,798-803 (1986).    Moreover,  Congress\n\nevidently  knew that  its command  reversed years  of extradition\n\npractice forbidding judicial investigation  into such areas.  See\n                                                                 \n\n132  Cong. Rec. 16,800 (1986) (describing article 3(a) as \"a very\n\nbroad,  and far  reaching provision\");  id. at  16,806 (labelling\n                                           \n\nthis aspect of the treaty \"historic\").  \n\n          Still, the article  3(a) defense,  though a  refreshing\n\nzephyr  to persons  resisting  extradition, is  not of  hurricane\n\nforce;  its mere invocation will  not sweep aside  all notions of\n\ninternational comity  and deference  to  the requesting  nation's\n\nsovereignty.    At least  four principles  rein  in the  winds of\n\nchange.  First, elementary rules of construction dictate that the\n\ndefense  not  be  construed  so  expansively  as  to  negate  the\n\nremainder of the treaty.   See, e.g., Factor, 290 U.S. at 292-93.\n                                            \n\nThe  rule  of noninquiry  developed from  the assumption  that an\n\nextradition treaty, by its  very existence, constitutes a general\n\n                                20\n\nacceptance  of another  country's legal system.   See  supra Part\n                                                            \n\nV(A).  By like  token, the existence of  an overall agreement  on\n\nextradition must inform the workings of the article 3(a) defense,\n\nlimiting  its applicability to  specific problems  encountered by\n\nspecific respondents, as opposed to general grievances concerning\n\nsystemic  weaknesses  inherent in  every  case.   Otherwise,  the\n\nextradition treaty actually becomes an impediment to extradition,\n\nin other words,  a non-extradition  treaty.  See  132 Cong.  Rec.\n                                                \n\n16,607 (1986).\n\n          Second,  controlling  precedent  requires  that,  where\n\npossible,   we   interpret   extradition   treaties   to  produce\n\nreciprocity  between,  and  expanded  rights on  behalf  of,  the\n\nsignatories:\n\n          [Treaties] should be  liberally construed  so\n          as  to effect the  apparent intention  of the\n          parties  to  secure equality  and reciprocity\n          between them.   For that reason,  if a treaty\n          fairly  admits  of  two   constructions,  one\n          restricting the  rights which may  be claimed\n          under  it,  and the  other enlarging  it, the\n          more liberal construction is to be preferred.\n\nFactor,  290 U.S. at 293-94.  These principles of reciprocity and\n      \n\nliberal  construction  have  particular force  here  because  the\n\nUnited  States, unlike the U.K. and certain other nations, has no\n\navailable  machinery  for  prosecuting  those  who commit  crimes\n\nabroad but who are, nonetheless, non-extraditable.  See 132 Cong.\n                                                       \n\nRec. 16,587 (1986).\n\n          Third, article  3(a) requires  an accused to  establish\n\nthat  he would,  if  surrendered, be  \"prejudiced\" on  account of\n\nparticular factors.   In our  view, this word  denotes that  only\n\n                                21\n\nthose preformed ideas relative to race, nationality, and the like\n\nwhich  are  of  sufficient   magnitude  actually  to  affect  the\n\naccused's  situation,  i.e.,  to  \"prejudice\"  him,  trigger  the\n                           \n\nspecial prophylactic protections of the Supplementary Treaty.\n\n          Finally,  the  legislative  history  suggests  that, in\n\ninsisting upon  the inclusion  of article  3(a),  the Senate  was\n\nconcerned  largely   with  the   special  Diplock  court   system\n\napplicable  to  those  accused  of  terrorist  acts  in  Northern\n\nIreland.   See 132  Cong.  Rec. 16,806-19  (1986).   There is  no\n              \n\nindication that the defense was meant  as a slur upon, much  less\n\nan indictment of, the British legal system.\n\n          For these  four reasons, we  conclude that the  soil of\n\nthis  case   is   particularly   inhospitable   to   a   rambling\n\ninterpretation  of article 3(a).   We  hold, therefore,  that, in\n\norder  to  avail  himself   of  the  article  3(a)  defense,   an\n\nextradition  target  must establish  by  a  preponderance of  the\n\ncredible  evidence that, if he were surrendered, the legal system\n\nof the requesting country would  treat him differently from other\n\nsimilarly  situated individuals  because  of his  race, religion,\n\nnationality, or political opinions.   It is not enough  simply to\n\nshow some  possibility that preformed ideas  might exist; rather,\n\nunder the terms of  the Supplementary Treaty, the bias  must rise\n\nto the level of  prejudicing the accused.  See  generally William\n                                                         \n\nM.  Hannay,  Committee  Report:   An  Analysis  of  the U.S.-U.K.\n                                                                 \n\nSupplementary Extradition Treaty, 21 Int'l Law. 925 (1987).\n                                \n\n           C.  Appellant's \"Per Se Prejudice\" Argument.\n                                                      \n\n                                22\n\n          We now face the task of applying the prejudice standard\n\nin  this case.    The record  reveals  that the  magistrate  paid\n\ncareful  attention to an array of facts that sometimes pointed in\n\ndifferent directions.   For  instance, he  found that there  were\n\nsome negative articles about Howard,  that some Britons might  be\n\nbiased  against  black  Americans, and  that  the  U.K.  does not\n\nutilize   a  voir   dire  procedure   to   screen  venirepersons.\n\nNonetheless,  in  the  magistrate's  eyes, these  facts  did  not\n\nestablish   an  article   3(a)  defense   because  countervailing\n\nconsiderations  mitigated  their negative  impact,  rendering any\n\nbias de minimis.   Appellant excoriates this finding, complaining\n               \n\nthat  it rests  upon a  faulty  legal premise.   He  asserts that\n\narticle  3 effectively eclipses the  rule of noninquiry; that the\n\nevidence he tendered constitutes per se proof  of prejudice which\n                                       \n\nirrebuttably establishes  an article  3(a) defense; and  that the\n\nSupplementary   Treaty  does  not  countenance  consideration  of\n\ncountervailing factors  in mulling  whether a defense  is extant.\n\nWe  concur  with the  magistrate  that  the Supplementary  Treaty\n\nstakes out a middle ground between the classic rule of noninquiry\n\nand  the total  abolition of that  rule:   the treaty  alters the\n\ntraditional   formulation  of   the  rule   while  simultaneously\n\npreserving many aspects  of it.   Any other interpretation  would\n\nrun afoul of the four constraining principles we have identified.\n\nSee supra at 20-21.\n         \n\n          One  manifestation  of  this  middle  position is  that\n\narticle  3(a),  as we  read it,  imposes  a de  minimis threshold\n                                                       \n\n                                23\n\nrequirement relative to the existence of prejudice.  For example,\n\nbecause  international  criminal  affairs  are   frequently  high\n\nprofile, a  per se rule  barring extradition  whenever there  has\n                  \n\nbeen any negative  publicity would undermine the entire treaty by\n\nmaking successful  article 3(a) defenses  virtually automatic and\n\nrelegating  extradition to  a few  fringe instances.   We  do not\n\nthink that the treaty partners intended so unproductive a result.\n\nSimilar reasoning rules out any per se prohibition on extradition\n                                      \n\nwhen  the accused  proffers evidence  suggesting discordant  race\n\nrelations in the U.K. or when he simply points to  the absence of\n\na specific procedural device.\n\n          Consequently,   we  hold   that,  while   a  magistrate\n\nconsidering the applicability  of article 3(a) must weigh each of\n\nthe  factors cited by  appellant if an  extradition target offers\n\nproof that  they exist, their  mere presence, without  more, does\n\nnot  conclusively  establish  an  article  3(a)  defense.8    The\n\nsomething \"more,\"  as  we have  indicated,  is prejudice  to  the\n\n                    \n\n     8This interpretation finds  analogies in prevailing  federal\ncourt  practice.  For instance,  we have routinely  held that the\nmere  presence   of   differing  procedural   devices,   pretrial\npublicity, or allegations  of community prejudice, without  more,\ndoes  not warrant overturning a criminal  conviction.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \nNeron v.

Having painstakingly  reviewed the papers in the\n\ncase in  light of the burden  of proof, we cannot  say that clear\n\nerror inheres.\n\n          Appellant   introduced  numerous   newspaper  articles,\n\naffidavits from several  people living in Great Britain,  and the\n\ntestimony  of  Paul  Stevenson,  a senior  executive  officer  of\n\nEngland's  Commission  for  Racial  Equality, in  an  attempt  to\n\n                    \n\n     9We  note, in  passing,  that the  rules governing  criminal\ntrials  in the federal courts  seem fully compatible  with such a\nrequirement.   See,  e.g., Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 52(a)  (\"Any error,\n                         \ndefect,   irregularity  or   variance   which  does   not  affect\nsubstantial rights shall be disregarded.\").\n\n     10We refer only to appellant's claim that, if extradited, he\nwould be prejudiced on account of his race.  He presented little,\nif  any, evidence suggesting  the existence  of nationality-based\nbiases in this  case, and we  cannot discern any error  (clear or\notherwise) in  the magistrate's finding that  appellant failed to\nprove cognizable prejudice of this genre.\n\n                                25\n\nestablish  that  widespread  publicity  would  prevent  him  from\n\nreceiving fair treatment abroad.   But, this evidence comprises a\n\nmixed bag.  It is true that some of the press clippings contained\n\nracial innuendo.  On the other hand, the publicity was mercifully\n\nbrief in  duration, for the most  part lasting less than  a week;\n\nthe U.K.'s  Contempt of Court  Act has been invoked  and will cut\n\noff  any  further  untoward publicity;  Howard's  counsel himself\n\ncreated  some  of the  notoriety in  his  rousing remarks  to the\n\nBritish  press;   the  media   coverage  was  not   uniformly  or\n\noverwhelmingly negative (indeed,  some of the newspaper  articles\n\ndescribe  appellant  favorably);  and,  finally,   the  publicity\n\noccurred over two years ago and will be very old news when and if\n\nappellant  eventually  comes  to  trial  in  England.    On  this\n\nconflicted record, the magistrate  did not perpetrate clear error\n\nin finding  that a spurt  of mixed publicity  created in part  by\n\nappellant's counsel and occurring years ago failed to rise to the\n\nlevel of prejudice necessary to sustain an article 3(a) defense.\n\n          The evidence  in  the record  concerning  the  supposed\n\nshortcomings  of the  requesting nation's  legal system  does not\n\nrequire  a different result for  it, too, is  mixed.  Admittedly,\n\nappellant  presented  affidavits  and testimony  suggesting  that\n\npreformed   ideas  constitute   a   particular   threat  in   the\n\ncircumstances  of this case  because the English  system does not\n\nprovide for American-style voir  dire of potential jurors.   But,\n\nevidence  submitted   by   the  government   and  elicited   from\n\nappellant's  witness  on  cross-examination  indicates  that  the\n\n                                26\n\nEnglish legal system has a host of other mechanisms which will be\n\navailable to  appellant and  which mitigate  the absence  of voir\n\ndire.  Appellant will be able to present his arguments concerning\n\nthe  impact  of  pretrial  publicity and  race  relations  during\n\ncommittal  proceedings in  the  U.K.    He  may  then  renew  the\n\narguments by requesting pretrial review at the Crown Court, again\n\nbefore  the trial  judge,  and still  again  on appeal  from  any\n\nconviction.  In  addition, the English system provides  for self-\n\nexcusal of  potentially biased jurors  and trial judges  are duty\n\nbound  to  offer   detailed  jury  instructions  concerning   the\n\nimpropriety  of grounding  defendants' convictions  on extraneous\n\nconsiderations.  Seen in this light, the absence of voir dire  in\n\nthe  English system is not of decretory significance.  After all,\n\ncourts must not let jingoism  run amok, but, rather, must turn  a\n\nsympathetic ear to other nations' independent judgments about how\n\nbest  to ensure fairness in  dealing with criminal  matters.  The\n\nUnited States has no monopoly on even-handed justice.\n\n          To  summarize,  the   evidence  concerning   prejudice,\n\nproperly decanted, is ambivalent.  The facts we have  catalogued,\n\nand  others in  the  record, comprise  adequate  support for  the\n\nmagistrate's  conclusion that  any evidence  of bias  relating to\n\nappellant's race is so  exiguous as not to animate  article 3(a).\n\nPut  another way, the magistrate weighed the proof, drew a series\n\nof  reasonable (albeit  not inevitable)  inferences from  it, and\n\nconcluded that appellant  had not carried  the burden of  proving\n\nprejudice.   We cannot say that this choice between two plausible\n\n                                27\n\nalternatives,  each  of  which   finds  support  in  the  record,\n\nconstitutes  clear error.

CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need  go   no  further.11     Article   3  of   the\n\nSupplementary   Treaty  significantly   alters  the   pattern  of\n\nprocedural avenues and substantive rights traditionally available\n\nin extradition  cases.   While these alterations  reconfigure the\n\nextradition   landscape,  they  do   not  render  it  impassable.\n\nFollowing  the map that Article  3 supplies, we  conclude that we\n\nhave  jurisdiction  to  consider  appellant's  claims;  that  the\n\nstandard of review governing his legal challenge is de novo; that\n                                                           \n\nthe standard  of review governing his fact-based challenge is for\n\nclear error; that  appellant's arguments anent  the scope of  the\n\narticle 3(a) defense  envision a grandeur which lacks  support in\n\nthe treaty's language or in the applicable law; and, that, in the\n\nlast analysis,  the magistrate's  findings of fact  derive enough\n\nsupport from  the record to  withstand attack.   Accordingly, the\n\n                    \n\n     11We do  not tarry  over the assertion  that the  magistrate\nerred  in denying appellant's motions  to stay proceedings and to\nsupplement the  evidence.   These motions  were addressed  to the\nmagistrate's discretion, and he  provided ample reasons for their\ndenial.   In the same vein,  we see no error  in the magistrate's\ndiscretionary   decision   allowing   the  government   to   file\nconfirmatory  materials  out  of  time.     On  this  score,  the\nsockdolager is that appellant neither sought to reopen the record\nto  counter  or  contest  the  belated  evidentiary  proffer  nor\nrequested time for this specific purpose.  He cannot now be heard\nto complain that he had no chance to respond.\n\n                                28\n\ndistrict  court lawfully  upheld the  magistrate's issuance  of a\n\ncertification of extraditability.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    Concurring Opinion Follows  \n\n                                29\n\n            CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge (Concurring).  While\n                                                       \n\n  joining  in  the  court's  opinion,  I  am  troubled  by  our\n\n  resolution of  the \"successive appeals\" issue.   Article 3(b)\n\n  provides that  a finding concerning an  Article 3(a) defense,\n\n  involving race, religion, nationality, or  political opinion,\n\n  \"shall  be  immediately appealable  by  either  party to  the\n\n  United  States  district  court,  or  court  of  appeals,  as\n\n  appropriate.\"   We hold  that this unclear  language does not\n\n  indicate that  an appellant receives only one appeal    i.e.,\n                                               \n\n  an appeal to the  district court, if the  initial extradition\n\n  decision was  by a magistrate, or  an appeal to the  court of\n                                   \n\n  appeals if the initial extradition decision was by a district\n\n  judge     but rather was meant to  provide, however clumsily,\n\n  for  the full federal appellate process.  Thus, where as here\n\n  the  initial  extradition  decision  was by  the  magistrate,\n\n  appellant  can  appeal, (1)  to  the  United States  district\n\n  court; (2) from  the  district court  to this  court; and,  I\n\n  assume, (3) from  this court to the Supreme  Court by writ of\n\n  certiorari.\n\n            It  is sad but true that this interpretation of the\n\n  ambiguous language     while  seemingly what was  intended   \n\n  creates significant new  opportunities for  persons to  delay\n\n  their extradition.  Historically, extradition decisions  by a\n\n  judge or  magistrate were  not appealable, thus  avoiding the\n\n  potential  delays  which   often  attend  appellate   review.\n\n                               -29-\n                                29\n\n  Obviously,  the  more  extradition  is susceptible  to  being\n\n  bogged  down in endless  procedural maneuvering,  the greater\n\n  the danger that essential witnesses  to the charged crime may\n\n  die or disappear and their memories fade prior to trial.   It\n\n  used to  be thought  that the  interest of  another civilized\n\n  nation  in enforcing  its  criminal law  entitled  it to  the\n\n  reasonably  prompt  extradition  of  accused  persons.    The\n\n  present appeal to this court  has enabled appellant to  delay\n\n  trial in Great Britain by another year or more.\n\n            It would have been useful had  the United States of\n\n  America gone more deeply,  in its briefs before us,  into the\n\n  pros and cons  of the proper interpretation  of Article 3(b).\n\n  In  a Treaty  case  of first  impression, the  interpretation\n\n  espoused by  the Attorney  General can  be enlightening.   As\n\n  best I can tell, the Attorney General agrees with the court's\n                                              \n\n  reading of the  Treaty, i.e., that the full federal appellate\n\n  process, and not a truncated version, was intended.  However,\n\n  the alternative interpretation    what my colleagues call the\n\n  \"one bite of the  apple\" approach     has  some appeal  given\n\n  Article  3(b)'s  literal  language  and  the  long  tradition\n\n  divorcing extradition from the  normal appellate process.  We\n\n  could have  benefited from  a more considered  explication of\n\n  all this by the United States.\n\n            In  any  event,  I  write separately  in  order  to\n\n  emphasize  the  implications  of  Article  3(b),  as  we  now\n\n                               -30-\n                                30\n\n  interpret it, so that the drafters  of future provisions will\n\n  have no  illusions  concerning the  inevitable potential  for\n\n  delay,  and  may decide  whether  other  approaches would  be\n\n  desirable.\n\n                               -31-\n                                31\n</pre>",
