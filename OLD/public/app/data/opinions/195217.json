The question  posed by this  appeal is  whether the\n\nestate  may deduct  the  settlement amount  for  purposes of  the\n\nfederal estate tax.   The answer depends upon  whether the mutual\n\nwill agreement was \"contracted bona  fide and for an adequate and\n\nfull consideration in money or  money's worth,\" as required by 26\n\nU.S.C.   2053(c)(1)(A).1   After careful review of  the facts and\n\nprecedent, we affirm the Tax Court's determination that the claim\n\nis not deductible.\n\n                    \n\n     1 Section 2053 provides in relevant part:\n\n          (a) General rule.--For purposes of the tax imposed\n                          \n     by section  2001, the value of the taxable estate shall\n     be determined by deducting from  the value of the gross\n     estate such amounts--\n          * * *\n          (3) for  claims against the  estate, . . .  as are\n     allowable by the  laws of the jurisdiction .  . . under\n     which the estate is being administered.\n          * * *\n          (c) Limitations.--\n                         \n          (1) Limitations applicable to subsections (a)\n                                                       \n          and (b).--\n                 \n          (A)  Consideration   for  claims.--The   deduction\n                                          \n     allowed  by this section in the  case of claims against\n     the estate .  . . shall,  when founded on a  promise or\n     agreement,  be limited  to the  extent  that they  were\n     contracted  bona  fide  and for  an  adequate  and full\n     consideration in money or money's worth . . . .\n\n                               -2-\n\n                               -3-\n\n                      I. Factual Background\n                                           \n\n     The decedent, Elizabeth Huntington, married Dana  Huntington\n\non October 15,  1955.   At that  time, Dana's two  sons from  his\n\nprevious  marriage, Charles and Myles, were, respectively, 30 and\n\n28 years old.  Elizabeth and Dana had one daughter, Nancy.\n\n     On January 3, 1978, Dana executed a will in which he devised\n\nto  Nancy, Charles and Myles $25,000 each.   The remainder of his\n\nestate would be held in trust for the  benefit of Elizabeth, and,\n\nupon her death, the trust would terminate and the corpus would be\n\ndistributed in equal shares to the three children.  This will was\n\nrevoked by Dana on May 8, 1979, when, during the illness that led\n\nto his death, he executed a new will.  The later will stated that\n\nDana intentionally was making no provision for Charles, Myles and\n\nNancy.   Instead,  Dana devised  his entire estate  to Elizabeth.\n\nDana  died  on April  6,  1980, and  his  May 8,  1979,  will was\n\nadmitted to probate.\n\n     Charles and  Myles maintain  that their  father changed  his\n\nwill in  1979 to  give everything to  Elizabeth only  because she\n\nagreed  to execute  a will  devising  her estate  in three  equal\n\nshares  to  Nancy, Charles  and  Myles.    They point  to  Dana's\n\nprevious  will to demonstrate his  intent to make direct bequests\n\nto his sons, and they refer to conversations through the years in\n\nwhich Dana acknowledged  a moral obligation to leave  part of his\n\nestate  to his  sons in  order to  compensate for  the inadequate\n\ndivorce settlement their mother received.\n\n                               -4-\n\n     They also offer direct evidence  of an agreement between the\n\ncouple.    Dana's  attorney, William  Beckett,  testified  in his\n\ndeposition that, shortly  before execution of the 1979 will, Dana\n\nand Elizabeth discussed the arrangement in which Dana would leave\n\neverything to her and  she shortly would draft a will  that would\n\ninclude Charles  and Myles.   Also in a deposition,  Myles's wife\n\ntestified that  at  the  family  luncheon  immediately  following\n\nDana's funeral, Elizabeth told her that \"`Dana left everything to\n\nme,' meaning herself, with the understanding that upon her death,\n\neverything would  be divided equally between  the boys . .  . and\n\nNancy . . . .\"  See App. at 133.\n                   \n\n     Charles and Myles  initially attempted to challenge  the May\n\n8, 1979 will based on their father's alleged mental incompetence.\n\nThey dropped  that lawsuit,2 and  on September 10, 1981,  filed a\n\npetition  in Rockingham County  (N.H.) Superior Court  seeking to\n\nimpose a  constructive trust on  all of the property  received by\n\nElizabeth from Dana's estate and on all of the property owned  by\n\nthe decedent on and  after May 8, 1979, the date  of Dana's final\n\nwill.   They alleged  that Dana and  decedent had  made a binding\n\noral  agreement to execute  reciprocal wills, and  that Elizabeth\n\nhad not yet executed a will in compliance with the agreement.\n\n     On November 12, 1981, the superior court  issued a temporary\n\nrestraining  order barring Elizabeth  from taking any  actions to\n\nencumber or transfer the property.  Five years later, on December\n\n                    \n\n     2 They abandoned  this effort because  of the difficulty  of\nproving that  the will  was the product  of undue  influence, see\n                                                                 \nDeposition of Myles Huntington, May 16, 1986, at 27.  \n\n                               -5-\n\n10, 1986, Elizabeth,  Charles and Myles settled  the constructive\n\ntrust  lawsuit.   The settlement  provided  that Elizabeth  would\n\nexecute a will in which she would devise 20 percent of her estate\n\nto each of  Dana's sons.  Two  weeks later, however,  on December\n\n24, 1986,  Elizabeth died intestate.   Charles and Myles  filed a\n\nnotice of claim against her estate  and, subsequently, they filed\n\na lawsuit to enforce the settlement terms.\n\n     Charles,   Myles,  and   their  stepsister,   Nancy   --  as\n\nadministratrix of her  mother's estate -- eventually  settled the\n\nlawsuit brought to enforce the  terms of the earlier constructive\n\ntrust  settlement.  Under the second  settlement, Nancy agreed to\n\npay  to  Charles  and  Myles  a  total  of  $425,000,  an  amount\n\nrepresenting 40 percent of Elizabeth's  estate.  Nancy made  that\n\npayment on April 14, 1989.\n\n     On   the  federal  tax  return  for  Elizabeth's  estate,  a\n\ndeduction was taken  for the settlement payment based  on section\n\n2053(a)(3)  of the Internal Revenue Code, which allows deductions\n\nfor  \"claims against the  estate.\"3  The  Commissioner disallowed\n\nthe deduction,  and calculated  a deficiency  of $117,067  in the\n\nestate tax.4\n\n                    \n\n     3 The estate return was  filed before the settlement reached\namong Charles, Myles and Nancy and the amount originally deducted\nwas $350,000.  The estate later claimed a deduction for the  full\namount of the $425,000 payment.\n\n     4 Both the Tax Court opinion and the Commissioner's brief on\nappeal state that the Commissioner rejected the deduction  on the\nground that  the payment  was a  testamentary disposition  rather\nthan a  claim against  the estate within  the meaning  of section\n2053(a).  The Commissioner's Notice of Deficiency did not specify\nthe basis of the rejection.  See App. at 73.\n                                \n\n                               -6-\n\n     The  Tax  Court  affirmed.    It  found  that  the  asserted\n\nreciprocal  will  agreement  between Dana  and  Elizabeth  lacked\n\nadequate  consideration to support a \"claim[] against the estate\"\n\nwithin the meaning of section 2053.  The court concluded that the\n\nonly consideration  underlying  the agreement  was  the  couple's\n\n\"donative   intent,\"   making   the   agreement  a   testamentary\n\narrangement rather than  an arms-length deal providing  the basis\n\nfor a deduction.  The  court further held that the lawsuit  filed\n\nby  Charles  and Myles  to  enforce the  alleged  reciprocal will\n\nagreement did not change the essence of the sons' claim so  as to\n\nrender their claim deductible. \n\n     On  appeal,  the  estate  argues  that   Elizabeth  received\n\nsubstantial  consideration in exchange for her promise to provide\n\nfor Charles and  Myles in her will -- the excess amount over what\n\nshe would  have received  under Dana's revoked  1978 will  -- and\n\nthat  this consideration made  the sons' claim  fully enforceable\n\nand deductible.  In addition,  the estate contends that Elizabeth\n\nalso  received valuable consideration when she agreed in December\n\n1986 to settle  the constructive trust lawsuit.   In exchange for\n\nher  promise to  execute  a will  in  which she  would  devise 40\n\npercent of her estate to Charles and Myles, her stepsons released\n\ntheir claim  to two-thirds  of her estate.   The  estate contends\n\nthat either  or both  of these  considerations  is sufficient  to\n\nsupport its claim to a deduction under section 2053.\n\n     As  there is no  material dispute concerning  the underlying\n\nfacts,  our task  is to  determine solely  whether the  Tax Court\n\n                               -7-\n\nproperly applied the statute in  these circumstances.  Our review\n\ntherefore is de novo. See LeBlanc  v. B.G.T. Corp., 992 F.2d 394,\n                                                  \n\n396 (1st Cir. 1993).  \n\n                               II. \n\n     At the risk of stating the obvious, we think it worth noting\n\nat the  outset that  any analysis of  estate tax  issues must  be\n\nsensitive  to \"the general polic[y] of taxing the transmission of\n\nwealth  at death,\"  United States  v.  Stapf, 375  U.S. 118,  134\n                                            \n\n(1963).  Section 2053 of  the Internal Revenue Code, which allows\n\ndeductions from a decedent's gross estate for certain claims, has\n\nbeen carefully  crafted to promote  that policy.  In  a series of\n\nrevisions  to  the  statutory  language  early  in  the  century,\n\nincreasingly  formal requirements were imposed on claims based on\n\npromises or agreements, see  Taft v. Commissioner, 304 U.S.  351,\n                                                 \n\n355-56 (1938);5 Estate  of Pollard, 52 T.C. 741,  744 (1969), \"to\n                                  \n\n                    \n\n     5  The history  of  section  2053 was  detailed  in Taft  as\n                                                             \nfollows:\n\n     The Revenue  Act of 1916 permitted the deduction of the\n     amount of  claims against  the estate  \"allowed by  the\n     laws of the  jurisdiction . . . under  which the estate\n     is  being administered.\" . . .  The Act of 1924 altered\n     existing  law and  authorized the  deduction of  claims\n     against an  estate only  to the  extent that they  were\n     \"incurred  or contracted  bona  fide  and  for  a  fair\n     consideration in money or money's worth.\"  Congress had\n     reason  to think that  the phrase  \"fair consideration\"\n     would be  held to comprehend  an instance of  a promise\n     which was  honest, reasonable, and  free from suspicion\n     whether or not  the consideration for it  was, strictly\n     speaking, adequate.    The  words  \"adequate  and  full\n     consideration\" were substituted  by   303(a)(1) of  the\n     Act of 1926.\n\n304 U.S. at 356 (footnotes omitted).\n\n                               -8-\n\nprevent deductions,  under the guise  of claims, of what  were in\n\nreality gifts or  testamentary dispositions,\" Carney v.  Benz, 90\n                                                             \n\nF.2d 747, 749 (1st Cir. 1937).\n\n     In other words, Congress wanted  to be sure that bequests to\n\nfamily members and other natural objects of the decedent's bounty\n\nwere not transformed into deductible claims through collaboration\n\nand creative contracting.  See Bank of New York v. United States,\n                                                                \n\n526  F.2d 1012, 1016-17  (3d Cir. 1975); Carney,  90 F.2d at 749;\n                                               \n\nEstate  of Satz  v.  Commissioner,  78  T.C. 1172,  1178  (1982);\n                                 \n\nPollard, 52  T.C. at 744.  Thus, a  \"claim against the estate\" is\n       \n\ndeductible only  if the  agreement giving rise  to the  claim was\n\n\"contracted bona fide  and for an adequate and full consideration\n\nin money or money's worth,\" 26 U.S.C.   2053(c)(1)(A).\n\n     Thus  far,  this  case  has  focused  primarily  on  whether\n\nElizabeth  Huntington received  sufficient consideration,  within\n\nthe meaning of  section 2053, for her promise  to include Charles\n\nand  Myles  in her  will.    The  Tax Court  concluded  that  the\n\nHuntingtons'  reciprocal  will agreement  was  supported  only by\n\ndonative  intent, and  that this  was not  enough to  establish a\n\ndeductible claim.   In its notice of appeal and in its brief, the\n\nestate  specifically challenges the Tax Court's failure to credit\n\nas   consideration  Elizabeth's   enhanced  inheritance   --  the\n\nimmediate $75,000 representing the bequests previously  earmarked\n\nfor Charles, Myles and Nancy, plus absolute rights in the balance\n\nof   Dana's  estate  (in  contrast  to  simply  a  life  estate).\n\nAlternatively, it offers as \"adequate and full\" consideration the\n\n                               -9-\n\nfinancial benefit conferred  on Elizabeth when Charles  and Myles\n\ndropped the constructive trust lawsuit in exchange for her second\n\npromise to include them in her will.\n\n     Our view of the caselaw,  reflected against the backdrop  of\n\nsection  2053(c)(1)(A)'s limiting purpose,  persuades us that the\n\nreal issue here  is not  whether Elizabeth  received a  financial\n\nbenefit from the reciprocal will agreement -- clearly, she did --\n\nbut  whether  the mutual  promises  made  by Dana  and  Elizabeth\n\ncreated the sort of \"bona fide\" contractual obligation for  which\n\nsection 2053  allows a deduction.   We have little  difficulty in\n\nconcluding that they did not.\n\n     Two  threshold  propositions  inform  our  inquiry.   First,\n\ntransactions  among  family  members  are  subject  to particular\n\nscrutiny, even  when they  apparently are  supported by  monetary\n\nconsideration, because that is the context in which a testator is\n\nmost likely to  be making a bequest  rather than repaying a  real\n\ncontractual obligation.  See Bank of New York, 526 F.2d at  1016;\n                                             \n\nEstate of Morse  v. Commissioner, 69 T.C. 408,  418 (1977), aff'd\n                                                                 \n\nper  curiam, 625 F.2d  133 (1980); Estate of  Woody, 36 T.C. 900,\n                                                   \n\n903 (1961).6  Second, we need not be concerned with whether a tax\n\navoidance  motive was present here,  \"because it is the substance\n\nof the arrangement as a potential device for defeating the estate\n\ntax that is of  controlling significance,\" Estate of Pollard,  52\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n     6 We  note,  however, that  a  close relationship  does  not\nnecessarily  preclude a deduction under  section 2053.  See infra\n                                                                 \nat 13-14.  It simply requires  close judicial review.  Estate  of\n                                                                 \nMorse, 69 T.C. at 418.\n     \n\n                               -10-\n\nT.C. at 745.   See also Young v. United States, 559 F.2d 695, 703\n                                              \n\n(D.C. Cir. 1977).\n\n     Thus, while  the record  in this  case provides no  evidence\n\nthat the Huntingtons sought to defeat estate  taxes through their\n\nreciprocal will agreement, this fact does not assist the estate's\n\neffort  to  overturn  the deficiency  judgment.    The record  is\n\nequally  barren of  evidence indicating  that  the agreement  was\n\nother than a collaborative effort to pass on the family's assets.\n\nFrom  all that appears in  the record, it  is most plausible that\n\nDana  and  Elizabeth  discussed   their  respective  desires  for\n\ndisposing  of their property, and concluded that everyone's needs\n\nwould be  met by the simple  will ultimately executed  by Dana on\n\nMay  8, 1979,  and the  will Elizabeth  was expected  to complete\n\nshortly  thereafter.    Such  a  purely  voluntary,  testamentary\n\narrangement  is not  the product  of  a bona  fide contract,  and\n\nconsequently does  not  provide a  basis  for a  deduction  under\n\nsection 2053.\n\n     The   estate  suggests  that,   because  Dana  had   a  firm\n\ncommitment,  evidenced  by  his  prior  wills,7  to  make  direct\n\nbequests to his  sons, the change in his last will must have been\n\nthe product of bona fide  bargaining between the couple.  Neither\n\nthe fact that Elizabeth received an immediate advantage, relative\n\nto the earlier wills,  nor Dana's longstanding intention to  make\n\n                    \n\n     7 The will in effect before 1978, which had been executed in\n1971, provided  for a bequest  of one-half of his  adjusted gross\nestate  to Elizabeth,  and for  the  rest to  pass  to Myles  and\nCharles.  \n\n                               -11-\n\nhis  sons beneficiaries  of  his estate  is  enough, however,  to\n\ntransform  an apparently cooperative  agreement into a  bona fide\n\ncontract.  See Estate of Morse, 69 T.C. at 418.\n                              \n\n     Dana simply may  have changed his mind about the best way to\n\nprovide for  his family, either  before or after  discussion with\n\nElizabeth.  By passing on his entire  estate to his wife, who was\n\nsubstantially  younger than  himself, he  could  ensure that  she\n\nwould be fully provided for  as long as she  lived.  He may  have\n\nfelt that  Charles and  Myles, both well  into adulthood,  had no\n\nimmediate need for  the money.  By securing  his wife's agreement\n\nthat  the balance  of  both  of their  estates  would be  divided\n\nequally among the couple's three children, he still could fulfill\n\nhis moral obligation to Charles and Myles.\n\n     There  is  no  evidence  that  Dana  and  Elizabeth  reached\n\nagreement on the asserted reciprocal wills only after a period of\n\ngive-and-take bargaining.   Indeed, Dana's sister  testified that\n\nher brother's  lawyer suggested that  \"he not discuss  every last\n\ndetail of  his estate  plan [with  Elizabeth] because  . . .  she\n\nwould  probably want  to argue  over every  point.\"   Elizabeth's\n\nwishes may have  played a substantial role in  Dana's decision to\n\nchange his will -- she was, after all, his wife -- but the record\n\nis silent as to any form of negotiations.8\n\n                    \n\n     8 In its brief, the estate points to comments allegedly made\nby Elizabeth and by Dana's sister, Marjorie, suggesting that Dana\nbecame increasingly vulnerable to Elizabeth's \"verbal onslaughts\"\nduring his  illness and  that Elizabeth was  aggressive on  money\nissues  after Dana's  death.   This evidence  does  not, however,\nreveal  why  and  how  Dana  and  Elizabeth  decided  to  execute\nreciprocal wills.\n\n                               -12-\n\n     This  is not  to say  that \"hard  bargaining as  would occur\n\nbetween  hostile parties  is  [] an  absolute  prerequisite to  a\n\ndeduction under section 2053,\" Estate of Morse, 69 T.C. at  419. \n                                              \n\nBut when family  members adopt a course of action whose object is\n\nto pass  on their collective  wealth, a deduction for  the amount\n\nultimately transferred is not permitted under section 2053 unless\n\nthere is  some showing  of a bargained-for  exchange.   Any other\n\nconclusion would  seriously undermine  the policy  of taxing  the\n\ntransfer of  wealth  at  death.   Where,  as here,  there  is  no\n\nevidence of any type of  negotiations, the claim to deductibility\n\nunquestionably fails for lack of proof.\n\n     The  language of  the Third Circuit  in Bank of  New York v.\n                                                              \n\nUnited States, 526 F.2d at 1017, is equally applicable here:\n             \n\n          When the  interests  of  family  members  are  not\n     divergent  but coincide  so  that  the  elements  of  a\n     transaction advance the separate  concerns of each,  we\n     are unable to find the arm's length bargain mandated by\n     the  Code.  This  Court has adhered  to the distinction\n     between  family  arrangements  bargained  for at  arm's\n     length and family arrangements that reflect a community\n     of interests.  Tax advantages are not permitted when an\n     agreement between members of a family could be regarded\n     as  a   cooperative  attempt  to  make  a  testamentary\n     disposition rather than as an arm's length bargain.\n\n     Indeed,  on the issue  of arm's-length bargaining,  the case\n\nbefore us is indistinguishable from Bank  of New York, in which a\n                                                     \n\nhusband  and wife executed reciprocal wills leaving their estates\n\nfirst to each other  and then to specifically identified  friends\n\nand relatives.  The wife later  made several changes in her will,\n\neliminating  one  of  the  husband's   chosen  beneficiaries  and\n\nlimiting the bequest to the  other.  The wife's estate eventually\n\n                               -13-\n\nsettled with the two disadvantaged beneficiaries, and then sought\n\nto deduct the settlement payment for estate tax purposes.\n\n     The Third Circuit upheld the Commissioner's rejection of the\n\ndeduction, concluding that \"the value of the claim settled by the\n\nestate may not  be deducted if the  agreement on which the  claim\n\nwas based was not bargained at arm's  length.\"  526 F.2d at 1016.\n\nThe court found that no  such bargaining took place there because\n\nthe  parties were  \"of one  mind\" when  they executed  the mutual\n\nwills for the purpose of fixing the ultimate disposition of their\n\nproperty.  Id.  at 1017.  \"There  is nothing in the  record,\" the\n              \n\ncourt observed, \"to support a  finding that the mutual wills here\n\nwere  executed as  the result of  an arm's length  bargain of any\n\nsort.\"  Id.\n           \n\n     The court  in Bank of  New York carefully  and appropriately\n                                    \n\ndistinguished  cases  involving  family   arrangements  in  which\n\ndeductions  were upheld, noting  that they involved  \"the sort of\n\nagreements  that arise  between  parties  separated by  divergent\n\ninterests,\" id. at 1016-17.  The clearest cases are those arising\n               \n\nin the  divorce setting,  where it is  likely that  the estranged\n\nspouses obtain advantages only by trading them for concessions on\n\nother issues.  See, e.g., Leopold v. United States, 510 F.2d 617,\n                                                  \n\n624 (9th  Cir. 1975); Estate  of Scholl v.

See In re Estate of  Hartshorne, 402\n                                                            \nF.2d 592,  596 (2d  Cir. 1968)  (deduction allowed for  ex-wife's\nlife interest  in property  but denied  for children's  remainder\ninterest).  \n\n                               -14-\n\n     In other instances,  courts have upheld deductions  when the\n\nunderlying  transactions demonstrated that the claim at issue was\n\nbased on a  \"purely commercial undertaking,\"  Carney, 90 F.2d  at\n                                                    \n\n749,  or  was  \"[i]n  no sense  .  .  .  a  device for  making  a\n\ntestamentary gift,\" Estate of Woody, 36 T.C. at 904.  In Woody, a\n                                                              \n\ndeduction  was  allowed for  a  father's $14,000  bequest  to his\n\ndaughter  that was intended  as reimbursement for  the daughter's\n\nearlier release of her brother -- at her father's request -- from\n\nan indebtedness  in that specific  amount.  In Carney,  the claim\n                                                     \n\nagainst the  decedent's estate was  based on a guaranty  given by\n\nthe decedent  on behalf of  his wife  and daughter  in a  regular\n\nbusiness context. \n\n     Some  courts have  suggested that  a  bona fide,  deductible\n\nclaim  can be  differentiated from  one  that fails  to meet  the\n\nrequirements  for deductibility by examining whether the claim is\n\nagainst  the estate or  to a portion  of the estate.   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nLatty v.

In  other\n                         \n\nwords, if  the  debt underlying  the claim  has its  origin in  a\n\ndiscretionary desire to pass on wealth to specific individuals --\n\ngiving those individuals a claim \"to\"  a portion of the estate --\n\nit  is  unlikely  to  be  the sort  of  bona  fide,  arm's-length\n\nobligation  that is  deductible under  the  statute.   Deductible\n\nclaims will have arisen from transactions that created true debts\n\n\"against\" the estate.\n\n                               -15-\n\n     The estate,  of course, insists  that there was a  debt here\n                                                    \n\nonce Elizabeth made her promise and received a financial benefit,\n\nbut  then reneged on the deal.  It  may be that, under state law,\n\nthe reciprocal will  agreement was an enforceable  contract that,\n\nwhen  violated, created  a debt  in  favor of  Charles and  Myles\n\nagainst the estate.  A  valid contract is not necessarily enough,\n\nhowever,  to establish a deductible claim for purposes of section\n\n2053.

The answer depends upon  whether the mutual\n\nwill agreement was \"contracted bona  fide and for an adequate and\n\nfull consideration in money or  money's worth,\" as required by 26\n\nU.S.C.   2053(c)(1)(A).1   After careful review of  the facts and\n\nprecedent, we affirm the Tax Court's determination that the claim\n\nis not deductible.\n\n                    \n\n     1 Section 2053 provides in relevant part:\n\n          (a) General rule.--For purposes of the tax imposed\n                          \n     by section  2001, the value of the taxable estate shall\n     be determined by deducting from  the value of the gross\n     estate such amounts--\n          * * *\n          (3) for  claims against the  estate, . . .  as are\n     allowable by the  laws of the jurisdiction .  . . under\n     which the estate is being administered.\n          * * *\n          (c) Limitations.--\n                         \n          (1) Limitations applicable to subsections (a)\n                                                       \n          and (b).--\n                 \n          (A)  Consideration   for  claims.--The   deduction\n                                          \n     allowed  by this section in the  case of claims against\n     the estate .  . . shall,  when founded on a  promise or\n     agreement,  be limited  to the  extent  that they  were\n     contracted  bona  fide  and for  an  adequate  and full\n     consideration in money or money's worth . . . .\n\n                               -2-\n\n                               -3-\n\n                      I. Factual Background\n                                           \n\n     The decedent, Elizabeth Huntington, married Dana  Huntington\n\non October 15,  1955.   At that  time, Dana's two  sons from  his\n\nprevious  marriage, Charles and Myles, were, respectively, 30 and\n\n28 years old.  Elizabeth and Dana had one daughter, Nancy.\n\n     On January 3, 1978, Dana executed a will in which he devised\n\nto  Nancy, Charles and Myles $25,000 each.   The remainder of his\n\nestate would be held in trust for the  benefit of Elizabeth, and,\n\nupon her death, the trust would terminate and the corpus would be\n\ndistributed in equal shares to the three children.  This will was\n\nrevoked by Dana on May 8, 1979, when, during the illness that led\n\nto his death, he executed a new will.  The later will stated that\n\nDana intentionally was making no provision for Charles, Myles and\n\nNancy.   Instead,  Dana devised  his entire estate  to Elizabeth.\n\nDana  died  on April  6,  1980, and  his  May 8,  1979,  will was\n\nadmitted to probate.\n\n     Charles and  Myles maintain  that their  father changed  his\n\nwill in  1979 to  give everything to  Elizabeth only  because she\n\nagreed  to execute  a will  devising  her estate  in three  equal\n\nshares  to  Nancy, Charles  and  Myles.    They point  to  Dana's\n\nprevious  will to demonstrate his  intent to make direct bequests\n\nto his sons, and they refer to conversations through the years in\n\nwhich Dana acknowledged  a moral obligation to leave  part of his\n\nestate  to his  sons in  order to  compensate for  the inadequate\n\ndivorce settlement their mother received.\n\n                               -4-\n\n     They also offer direct evidence  of an agreement between the\n\ncouple.    Dana's  attorney, William  Beckett,  testified  in his\n\ndeposition that, shortly  before execution of the 1979 will, Dana\n\nand Elizabeth discussed the arrangement in which Dana would leave\n\neverything to her and  she shortly would draft a will  that would\n\ninclude Charles  and Myles.   Also in a deposition,  Myles's wife\n\ntestified that  at  the  family  luncheon  immediately  following\n\nDana's funeral, Elizabeth told her that \"`Dana left everything to\n\nme,' meaning herself, with the understanding that upon her death,\n\neverything would  be divided equally between  the boys . .  . and\n\nNancy . . . .\"  See App. at 133.\n                   \n\n     Charles and Myles  initially attempted to challenge  the May\n\n8, 1979 will based on their father's alleged mental incompetence.\n\nThey dropped  that lawsuit,2 and  on September 10, 1981,  filed a\n\npetition  in Rockingham County  (N.H.) Superior Court  seeking to\n\nimpose a  constructive trust on  all of the property  received by\n\nElizabeth from Dana's estate and on all of the property owned  by\n\nthe decedent on and  after May 8, 1979, the date  of Dana's final\n\nwill.   They alleged  that Dana and  decedent had  made a binding\n\noral  agreement to execute  reciprocal wills, and  that Elizabeth\n\nhad not yet executed a will in compliance with the agreement.\n\n     On November 12, 1981, the superior court  issued a temporary\n\nrestraining  order barring Elizabeth  from taking any  actions to\n\nencumber or transfer the property.  Five years later, on December\n\n                    \n\n     2 They abandoned  this effort because  of the difficulty  of\nproving that  the will  was the product  of undue  influence, see\n                                                                 \nDeposition of Myles Huntington, May 16, 1986, at 27.  \n\n                               -5-\n\n10, 1986, Elizabeth,  Charles and Myles settled  the constructive\n\ntrust  lawsuit.   The settlement  provided  that Elizabeth  would\n\nexecute a will in which she would devise 20 percent of her estate\n\nto each of  Dana's sons.  Two  weeks later, however,  on December\n\n24, 1986,  Elizabeth died intestate.   Charles and Myles  filed a\n\nnotice of claim against her estate  and, subsequently, they filed\n\na lawsuit to enforce the settlement terms.\n\n     Charles,   Myles,  and   their  stepsister,   Nancy   --  as\n\nadministratrix of her  mother's estate -- eventually  settled the\n\nlawsuit brought to enforce the  terms of the earlier constructive\n\ntrust  settlement.  Under the second  settlement, Nancy agreed to\n\npay  to  Charles  and  Myles  a  total  of  $425,000,  an  amount\n\nrepresenting 40 percent of Elizabeth's  estate.  Nancy made  that\n\npayment on April 14, 1989.\n\n     On   the  federal  tax  return  for  Elizabeth's  estate,  a\n\ndeduction was taken  for the settlement payment based  on section\n\n2053(a)(3)  of the Internal Revenue Code, which allows deductions\n\nfor  \"claims against the  estate.\"3  The  Commissioner disallowed\n\nthe deduction,  and calculated  a deficiency  of $117,067  in the\n\nestate tax.4\n\n                    \n\n     3 The estate return was  filed before the settlement reached\namong Charles, Myles and Nancy and the amount originally deducted\nwas $350,000.  The estate later claimed a deduction for the  full\namount of the $425,000 payment.\n\n     4 Both the Tax Court opinion and the Commissioner's brief on\nappeal state that the Commissioner rejected the deduction  on the\nground that  the payment  was a  testamentary disposition  rather\nthan a  claim against  the estate within  the meaning  of section\n2053(a).  The Commissioner's Notice of Deficiency did not specify\nthe basis of the rejection.  See App. at 73.\n                                \n\n                               -6-\n\n     The  Tax  Court  affirmed.    It  found  that  the  asserted\n\nreciprocal  will  agreement  between Dana  and  Elizabeth  lacked\n\nadequate  consideration to support a \"claim[] against the estate\"\n\nwithin the meaning of section 2053.  The court concluded that the\n\nonly consideration  underlying  the agreement  was  the  couple's\n\n\"donative   intent,\"   making   the   agreement  a   testamentary\n\narrangement rather than  an arms-length deal providing  the basis\n\nfor a deduction.  The  court further held that the lawsuit  filed\n\nby  Charles  and Myles  to  enforce the  alleged  reciprocal will\n\nagreement did not change the essence of the sons' claim so  as to\n\nrender their claim deductible. \n\n     On  appeal,  the  estate  argues  that   Elizabeth  received\n\nsubstantial  consideration in exchange for her promise to provide\n\nfor Charles and  Myles in her will -- the excess amount over what\n\nshe would  have received  under Dana's revoked  1978 will  -- and\n\nthat  this consideration made  the sons' claim  fully enforceable\n\nand deductible.  In addition,  the estate contends that Elizabeth\n\nalso  received valuable consideration when she agreed in December\n\n1986 to settle  the constructive trust lawsuit.   In exchange for\n\nher  promise to  execute  a will  in  which she  would  devise 40\n\npercent of her estate to Charles and Myles, her stepsons released\n\ntheir claim  to two-thirds  of her estate.   The  estate contends\n\nthat either  or both  of these  considerations  is sufficient  to\n\nsupport its claim to a deduction under section 2053.\n\n     As  there is no  material dispute concerning  the underlying\n\nfacts,  our task  is to  determine solely  whether the  Tax Court\n\n                               -7-\n\nproperly applied the statute in  these circumstances.  Our review\n\ntherefore is de novo. See LeBlanc  v. B.G.T.

Thus, a  \"claim against the estate\" is\n       \n\ndeductible only  if the  agreement giving rise  to the  claim was\n\n\"contracted bona fide  and for an adequate and full consideration\n\nin money or money's worth,\" 26 U.S.C.   2053(c)(1)(A).\n\n     Thus  far,  this  case  has  focused  primarily  on  whether\n\nElizabeth  Huntington received  sufficient consideration,  within\n\nthe meaning of  section 2053, for her promise  to include Charles\n\nand  Myles  in her  will.    The  Tax Court  concluded  that  the\n\nHuntingtons'  reciprocal  will agreement  was  supported  only by\n\ndonative  intent, and  that this  was not  enough to  establish a\n\ndeductible claim.   In its notice of appeal and in its brief, the\n\nestate  specifically challenges the Tax Court's failure to credit\n\nas   consideration  Elizabeth's   enhanced  inheritance   --  the\n\nimmediate $75,000 representing the bequests previously  earmarked\n\nfor Charles, Myles and Nancy, plus absolute rights in the balance\n\nof   Dana's  estate  (in  contrast  to  simply  a  life  estate).\n\nAlternatively, it offers as \"adequate and full\" consideration the\n\n                               -9-\n\nfinancial benefit conferred  on Elizabeth when Charles  and Myles\n\ndropped the constructive trust lawsuit in exchange for her second\n\npromise to include them in her will.\n\n     Our view of the caselaw,  reflected against the backdrop  of\n\nsection  2053(c)(1)(A)'s limiting purpose,  persuades us that the\n\nreal issue here  is not  whether Elizabeth  received a  financial\n\nbenefit from the reciprocal will agreement -- clearly, she did --\n\nbut  whether  the mutual  promises  made  by Dana  and  Elizabeth\n\ncreated the sort of \"bona fide\" contractual obligation for  which\n\nsection 2053  allows a deduction.   We have little  difficulty in\n\nconcluding that they did not.\n\n     Two  threshold  propositions  inform  our  inquiry.   First,\n\ntransactions  among  family  members  are  subject  to particular\n\nscrutiny, even  when they  apparently are  supported by  monetary\n\nconsideration, because that is the context in which a testator is\n\nmost likely to  be making a bequest  rather than repaying a  real\n\ncontractual obligation.

Cir. 1977).\n\n     Thus, while  the record  in this  case provides no  evidence\n\nthat the Huntingtons sought to defeat estate  taxes through their\n\nreciprocal will agreement, this fact does not assist the estate's\n\neffort  to  overturn  the deficiency  judgment.    The record  is\n\nequally  barren of  evidence indicating  that  the agreement  was\n\nother than a collaborative effort to pass on the family's assets.\n\nFrom  all that appears in  the record, it  is most plausible that\n\nDana  and  Elizabeth  discussed   their  respective  desires  for\n\ndisposing  of their property, and concluded that everyone's needs\n\nwould be  met by the simple  will ultimately executed  by Dana on\n\nMay  8, 1979,  and the  will Elizabeth  was expected  to complete\n\nshortly  thereafter.    Such  a  purely  voluntary,  testamentary\n\narrangement  is not  the product  of  a bona  fide contract,  and\n\nconsequently does  not  provide a  basis  for a  deduction  under\n\nsection 2053.\n\n     The   estate  suggests  that,   because  Dana  had   a  firm\n\ncommitment,  evidenced  by  his  prior  wills,7  to  make  direct\n\nbequests to his  sons, the change in his last will must have been\n\nthe product of bona fide  bargaining between the couple.  Neither\n\nthe fact that Elizabeth received an immediate advantage, relative\n\nto the earlier wills,  nor Dana's longstanding intention to  make\n\n                    \n\n     7 The will in effect before 1978, which had been executed in\n1971, provided  for a bequest  of one-half of his  adjusted gross\nestate  to Elizabeth,  and for  the  rest to  pass  to Myles  and\nCharles.  \n\n                               -11-\n\nhis  sons beneficiaries  of  his estate  is  enough, however,  to\n\ntransform  an apparently cooperative  agreement into a  bona fide\n\ncontract.  See Estate of Morse, 69 T.C. at 418.\n                              \n\n     Dana simply may  have changed his mind about the best way to\n\nprovide for  his family, either  before or after  discussion with\n\nElizabeth.  By passing on his entire  estate to his wife, who was\n\nsubstantially  younger than  himself, he  could  ensure that  she\n\nwould be fully provided for  as long as she  lived.  He may  have\n\nfelt that  Charles and  Myles, both well  into adulthood,  had no\n\nimmediate need for  the money.  By securing  his wife's agreement\n\nthat  the balance  of  both  of their  estates  would be  divided\n\nequally among the couple's three children, he still could fulfill\n\nhis moral obligation to Charles and Myles.\n\n     There  is  no  evidence  that  Dana  and  Elizabeth  reached\n\nagreement on the asserted reciprocal wills only after a period of\n\ngive-and-take bargaining.   Indeed, Dana's sister  testified that\n\nher brother's  lawyer suggested that  \"he not discuss  every last\n\ndetail of  his estate  plan [with  Elizabeth] because  . . .  she\n\nwould  probably want  to argue  over every  point.\"   Elizabeth's\n\nwishes may have  played a substantial role in  Dana's decision to\n\nchange his will -- she was, after all, his wife -- but the record\n\nis silent as to any form of negotiations.8\n\n                    \n\n     8 In its brief, the estate points to comments allegedly made\nby Elizabeth and by Dana's sister, Marjorie, suggesting that Dana\nbecame increasingly vulnerable to Elizabeth's \"verbal onslaughts\"\nduring his  illness and  that Elizabeth was  aggressive on  money\nissues  after Dana's  death.   This evidence  does  not, however,\nreveal  why  and  how  Dana  and  Elizabeth  decided  to  execute\nreciprocal wills.\n\n                               -12-\n\n     This  is not  to say  that \"hard  bargaining as  would occur\n\nbetween  hostile parties  is  [] an  absolute  prerequisite to  a\n\ndeduction under section 2053,\" Estate of Morse, 69 T.C. at  419. \n                                              \n\nBut when family  members adopt a course of action whose object is\n\nto pass  on their collective  wealth, a deduction for  the amount\n\nultimately transferred is not permitted under section 2053 unless\n\nthere is  some showing  of a bargained-for  exchange.   Any other\n\nconclusion would  seriously undermine  the policy  of taxing  the\n\ntransfer of  wealth  at  death.   Where,  as here,  there  is  no\n\nevidence of any type of  negotiations, the claim to deductibility\n\nunquestionably fails for lack of proof.\n\n     The  language of  the Third Circuit  in Bank of  New York v.\n                                                              \n\nUnited States, 526 F.2d at 1017, is equally applicable here:\n             \n\n          When the  interests  of  family  members  are  not\n     divergent  but coincide  so  that  the  elements  of  a\n     transaction advance the separate  concerns of each,  we\n     are unable to find the arm's length bargain mandated by\n     the  Code.  This  Court has adhered  to the distinction\n     between  family  arrangements  bargained  for at  arm's\n     length and family arrangements that reflect a community\n     of interests.  Tax advantages are not permitted when an\n     agreement between members of a family could be regarded\n     as  a   cooperative  attempt  to  make  a  testamentary\n     disposition rather than as an arm's length bargain.\n\n     Indeed,  on the issue  of arm's-length bargaining,  the case\n\nbefore us is indistinguishable from Bank  of New York, in which a\n                                                     \n\nhusband  and wife executed reciprocal wills leaving their estates\n\nfirst to each other  and then to specifically identified  friends\n\nand relatives.  The wife later  made several changes in her will,\n\neliminating  one  of  the  husband's   chosen  beneficiaries  and\n\nlimiting the bequest to the  other.  The wife's estate eventually\n\n                               -13-\n\nsettled with the two disadvantaged beneficiaries, and then sought\n\nto deduct the settlement payment for estate tax purposes.\n\n     The Third Circuit upheld the Commissioner's rejection of the\n\ndeduction, concluding that \"the value of the claim settled by the\n\nestate may not  be deducted if the  agreement on which the  claim\n\nwas based was not bargained at arm's  length.\"  526 F.2d at 1016.\n\nThe court found that no  such bargaining took place there because\n\nthe  parties were  \"of one  mind\" when  they executed  the mutual\n\nwills for the purpose of fixing the ultimate disposition of their\n\nproperty.  Id.  at 1017.  \"There  is nothing in the  record,\" the\n              \n\ncourt observed, \"to support a  finding that the mutual wills here\n\nwere  executed as  the result of  an arm's length  bargain of any\n\nsort.\"  Id.\n           \n\n     The court  in Bank of  New York carefully  and appropriately\n                                    \n\ndistinguished  cases  involving  family   arrangements  in  which\n\ndeductions  were upheld, noting  that they involved  \"the sort of\n\nagreements  that arise  between  parties  separated by  divergent\n\ninterests,\" id. at 1016-17.  The clearest cases are those arising\n               \n\nin the  divorce setting,  where it is  likely that  the estranged\n\nspouses obtain advantages only by trading them for concessions on\n\nother issues.
