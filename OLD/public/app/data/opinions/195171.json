This  appeal seeks to  test the\n          SELYA, Circuit  Judge.\n                               \n\nconstitutionality  of Maine's Health Security Act, Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn.  tit. 24,     2851-2859  (West 1990)  (the Health  Act), the\n\nmechanics   of  its  application  in  diversity  suits,  and  the\n\nappropriateness of  sundry  evidentiary rulings  made during  the\n\ncourse of trial in the district court.  After assembling the test\n\nresults, we affirm.\n\n                                I.\n                                  \n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n          On or  about April 9,  1987, while in  her thirty-first\n\nweek  of  pregnancy,  plaintiff-appellant  Dawn   Daigle,  a  New\n\nHampshire resident, developed symptoms associated with pregnancy-\n\ninduced hypertension.   She sought treatment at  Frisbie Memorial\n\nHospital, Rochester,  New Hampshire.    There, Daigle's  treating\n\nobstetrician  advised her that she required an immediate cesarean\n\nsection.    Because  Frisbie Memorial  Hospital  maintained  only\n\nrudimentary neonatal facilities, the obstetrician suggested  that\n\nthe surgery be performed at a tertiary-care hospital.\n\n          Following  her  doctor's suggestion,  Daigle  presented\n\nherself at Maine Medical Center  (MMC) in the early morning hours\n\nof  April 10,  1987.   Examination  confirmed her  obstetrician's\n\ndiagnosis  and hospital  personnel  prepared  her  for  immediate\n\nsurgery.  The preparations did not go smoothly:  while a catheter\n\nwas  being  inserted  into  the  jugular vein  to  monitor  blood\n\npressure  and  provide access  to  medications,  Daigle's carotid\n\nartery was punctured.   A hematoma then formed  in Daigle's neck,\n\n                                2\n\ndeviating her trachea.   Consequently, although the  delivery was\n\notherwise  successful, the  attending physicians  were forced  to\n\nintubate Daigle while she was fully awake.  Daigle was discharged\n\nfrom the hospital on April 17, 1987.\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                          The Health Act\n                                        \n\n          Because many of  the arguments on appeal relate  to the\n\nHealth Act, we offer an overview of the statutory scheme.\n\n          The Maine legislature passed the Health Act in response\n\nto an emergent crisis that threatened the availability of medical\n\nmalpractice insurance.   The legislature designed the  Health Act\n\nin an  effort to  stem the  proliferation of medical  malpractice\n\nlitigation,  weed out  nonmeritorious  claims, and  promote early\n\nsettlement of meritorious  claims.  See Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann. tit.\n                                       \n\n24,   2851(1)(A)  &amp; (B); see also  Sullivan v. Johnson,  628 A.2d\n                                                      \n\n653, 655-56 (Me. 1993).   By its terms, the Act  requires parties\n\nto submit medical malpractice claims to a prelitigation screening\n\npanel as a condition precedent to court access, unless both sides\n\nagree to bypass the panel hearing.  See Me. Rev. Stat.  Ann. tit.\n                                       \n\n24,   2853.   Each screening panel  is composed of a  person with\n\njudicial experience (such  as a retired jurist), an attorney, and\n\neither  one or two  health care  professionals, depending  on the\n\ncircumstances of the particular case.  See id.   2852(2).\n                                              \n\n          A screening panel is  authorized to conduct evidentiary\n\nhearings and  render a decision.  See id.     2854-2855.  A party\n                                         \n\nwho submits to the screening  process is entitled to proceed with\n\n                                3\n\nher  court   case  regardless  of   the  outcome  of   the  panel\n\ndeliberations.   See id.    2858.   Withal, the  panel's findings\n                        \n\n(the  Findings)   are  admissible   as  evidence   in  subsequent\n\nlitigation if they  are unanimous.  See id.  When admissible, the\n                                           \n\nFindings  are to  be  introduced \"without  explanation.\"   Id.   \n                                                              \n\n2857(1)(B).\n\n                               III.\n                                   \n\n                        Proceedings Below\n                                         \n\n          On June 28,  1988 Daigle sued MMC in  the United States\n\nDistrict  Court for  the  District of  New  Hampshire.   Invoking\n\ndiversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C.   1332 (1988),  she alleged\n                           \n\nnegligence relating  to  treatment rendered  during her  hospital\n\nstay.  MMC challenged the court's in  personam jurisdiction, and,\n                                              \n\nfailing  in  its   jurisdictional  objection,  defended   on  the\n\nmerits.1\n\n          In due season, the district court determined that Maine\n\nlaw applied to Daigle's suit  and that, therefore, the Health Act\n\npertained.   Under  the compulsion of  that ruling,  Daigle first\n\npresented  her  case  to a  prelitigation  screening  panel which\n\nconsisted  of a retired jurist, two  physicians, and an attorney.\n\nAfter  an  evidentiary  hearing,  the  panel  found  no  acts  of\n\nnegligence  attributable either to  MMC or to  Daigle's attending\n\n                    \n\n     1MMC has  cross-appealed from the  denial of  its motion  to\ndismiss.   Given our  disposition of Daigle's  appeal, see infra,\n                                                                \nnothing  turns on  the cross-appeal.    Hence, we  dismiss it  by\nseparate order.   Cf.  Feinstein v.  Resolution Trust  Corp., 942\n                                                            \nF.2d 34, 40-41 (1st Cir. 1991). \n\n                                4\n\nphysicians at MMC,viz., Dr. Constance Taylor andDr. David Bryce.2\n                      \n\n          Notwithstanding  the panel's  adverse decision,  Daigle\n\ndecided to go forward.  At trial, the district court,  noting the\n\npanel's unanimity,  allowed the  Findings to  be introduced  into\n\nevidence.   Thereafter,  Daigle attempted  to  impeach the  panel\n\nproceedings,  but  to   no  avail;  the  court   sustained  MMC's\n\nobjections.  The jury  returned a verdict in MMC's favor on March\n\n10, 1993.  Daigle moved  unsuccessfully for a new trial and  then\n\nappealed.  We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.   1291 (1988).\n\n                               IV.\n                                  \n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\n                                A.\n                                  \n\n                  The Constitutional Challenges\n                                               \n\n          Appellant's  main   offensive  comprises   a  host   of\n\nchallenges  to  the constitutionality  of  the Health  Act.   She\n\nasserts,  inter alia,  that the  statute  violates principles  of\n                    \n\nequal protection and due process, and also impermissibly abridges\n\nher right to  trial by jury.  Despite  this asseverational array,\n\nthe constitutional sortie need not occupy us for long.\n\n          The short  of the matter  is that  appellant failed  to\n\nraise    these   claims    or   otherwise   to    challenge   the\n\nconstitutionality of the  Health Act in the district  court.  Our\n\nlaw is  clear that  a party  ordinarily may not  raise on  appeal\n\nissues  that were not seasonably advanced (and, hence, preserved)\n\n                    \n\n     2Although Daigle did not sue  either Dr. Taylor or Dr. Bryce\nin the federal court, she later sued them in a Maine state court.\nThat suit is still pending.\n\n                                5\n\nbelow.   See, e.g., United States v. Slade,  980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1993); Clauson  v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 666  (1st Cir. 1987)\n                             \n\n(collecting  cases).  The  raise-or-waive rule applies  with full\n\nforce  to constitutional challenges.   See  Cohen v.  President &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nFellows of  Harvard Coll., 729  F.2d 59, 60-61 (1st  Cir.), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 469 U.S. 874 (1984).\n      \n\n          To  be sure,  the raise-or-waive  rule  is not  totally\n\ninelastic; there  are exceptions to  it, but, for the  most part,\n\nthe exceptions  are narrowly configured and  sparingly dispensed.\n\nWe will,  for example,  relax the  rule upon  a showing  of plain\n\nerror, see  United States  v. Griffin, 818  F.2d 97,  99-100 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.),  cert.  denied,  484  U.S.  844  (1987),  but  appellant's\n                     \n\nconstitutional claims do not qualify for such  treatment.  \"Plain\n\nerror\" requires the proponent to  show that softening the rule is\n\nnecessary to prevent  a clear miscarriage of justice,  see id. at\n                                                              \n\n100, and the \"errors\" assigned here are, in all events, likely to\n\nprove a losing  proposition.3  We can  also relax the rule  in an\n\n\"exceptional case,\"  United States v. La Guardia,  902 F.2d 1010,\n                                                \n\n1013 (1st Cir. 1990), but we invoke that  exception only when, at\n\na bare minimum, the omitted  ground is so compelling as virtually\n\n                    \n\n     3At  initial  blush,   none  of  appellant's  constitutional\ncontentions are convincing.   With respect to her  claim that the\nHealth  Act violates equal  protection in requiring  only medical\nmalpractice claimants to submit to screening before proceeding to\ntrial, we believe  that the statute is rationally  related to the\nlegitimate   legislative   goal   of   containing   the    sudden\nproliferation of  medical malpractice  litigation.   See Houk  v.\n                                                             \nFurman, 613  F. Supp. 1022,  1030-33 (D. Me. 1985).   Appellant's\n      \ndue process and  Seventh Amendment claims appear to  be even more\nseverely flawed.\n\n                                6\n\nto  ensure an  appellant's success.   See Slade, 980  F.2d at 31.\n                                               \n\nObviously, Daigle cannot clear this hurdle.  See supra note 3.\n                                                      \n\n          We  hold,  therefore, that  appellant's  constitutional\n\nclaims are procedurally defaulted.4\n\n                                B.\n                                  \n\n                    The Section 2857 Challenge\n                                              \n\n          Next,  appellant  launches  a barrage  of  interrelated\n\nreasons  aimed  at  showing  why the  district  court  erred,  on\n\nevidentiary  grounds, in  admitting the  Findings into  evidence.\n\nThese theories do not withstand scrutiny.\n\n          1.    The  Meaning of  \"Without  Explanation\".   First,\n          1.    The  Meaning of  \"Without  Explanation\".\n                                                       \n\nappellant claims that  the district court erred in giving literal\n\neffect  to the Health  Act, which  provides that  unanimous panel\n\ndecisions, i.e.,  Findings, may be  admitted into evidence  at an\n               \n\nensuing trial \"without  explanation.\"  Me.  Rev. Stat. Ann.  tit.\n\n24,   2857.  The district court interpreted \"without explanation\"\n\nas preventing either side from eliciting testimony concerning the\n\ncircumstances of, and deliberative process at, the panel hearing,\n\nbut as  permitting counsel  for the parties  to comment  upon the\n\n                    \n\n     4In  connection with these claims, appellant also presses an\nargument that the panel as constituted was biased, resulting in a\nfundamentally  unfair hearing and,  hence, in a  violation of her\ndue  process rights.   Unlike  her  other constitutional  claims,\nappellant successfully  preserved this issue for review.  But the\nbottom  line remains unchanged.   Assuming, for  argument's sake,\nthat   the  district  court  possessed  the  power  to  entertain\nappellant's objection to the panel's  supposed bias   a matter on\nwhich we do not opine   our perscrutation of the record persuades\nus,  beyond serious  question, that  the district  court  did not\nabuse its discretion  in denying appellant's motion  to set aside\nthe Findings and order a fresh start.\n\n                                7\n\nFindings  in   opening  statements   and  closing  arguments   (a\n\nprerogative  which MMC desired  and which appellant  would sooner\n\nhave seen by the wayside).\n\n          In  arguing  that   this  protocol  constitutes  error,\n\nappellant  is whistling  past  the graveyard.    Her position  is\n\nentirely undone by the recent opinion in Sullivan v. Johnson, 628\n                                                            \n\nA.2d 653  (Me. 1993),  a case in  which Maine's  Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt interpreted \"without explanation\"  in precisely the  manner\n\nthat the district judge anticipated.  The Sullivan court  elected\n                                                  \n\nto read the  statute \"as a whole with a  view toward effectuating\n\nthe Legislature's purpose of encouraging  pre-trial resolution of\n\nthese claims.\"  Id. at  655-56.  Proceeding in this  fashion, the\n                   \n\ncourt found that because the \"Legislature's intent [was] to force\n\nfinal disposition  of .  . . claims  [that the  panel unanimously\n\ndetermines to be  without merit] short  of trial,\" the  statutory\n\nlanguage only barred  \"explanation of the panel  deliberations or\n\nproceedings.\"  Id. at 656.  In that vein, the court  specifically\n                  \n\nheld that  \"it is  permissible for the  [parties] to  utilize [in\n\nopening statements and-or closing arguments] the admissible panel\n\nfindings  as they would any other  piece of admissible evidence.\"\n\nId.\n   \n\n          A federal court sitting  in diversity jurisdiction  and\n\ncalled upon in that role  to apply state law is  absolutely bound\n\nby a current interpretation of that law formulated by the state's\n\nhighest tribunal.  See Commissioner  v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n456,  464-65 (1967).   So  it  is here.

Appellant also  contends that\n          2.  The Erie Initiative.\n                                 \n\nthe lower  court erred, as  a matter of federal  evidentiary law,\n\nboth in admitting the Findings  into evidence and in  foreclosing\n\nan  opportunity for impeachment.   Though  recondite, appellant's\n\ntheory appears  to be  that section 2857  is a  state evidentiary\n\nrule and, as such, must give way to the Federal Rules of Evidence\n\nin a diversity  suit.  See Fed. R. Evid. 101 (explaining that the\n                          \n\nfederal Evidence  Rules \"govern proceedings\" in  federal courts);\n\nsee  also Erie  R.R. Co.  v. Tompkins,  304 U.S.  64, 78  (1938).\n                                     \n\nSince the panel's determination is hearsay, this thesis goes, the\n\ndistrict court bumbled  in not requiring MMC first to demonstrate\n\nan applicable exclusion or exception to the hearsay rule in order\n\nto justify admission of  the evidence.  And, moreover,  appellant\n\nremonstrates, even  if the  Findings were appropriately  admitted\n\ninto  evidence,  she had  a right,  under Fed.  R. Evid.  806, to\n\nimpeach the panelists' credibility.5\n\n          The fatal weakness  in appellant's construct lies  with\n\nher premise that the Health Act's evidentiary strictures are mere\n\nprocedural  rules.   Authoritative  case  law  makes  clear  that\n\nfederal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction are obligated to\n\n                    \n\n     5Fed. R. Evid. 806 provides in pertinent part:\n\n               When  a hearsay statement . . . has been\n          admitted in evidence, the credibility of  the\n          declarant  may be  attacked, and  if attacked\n          may be supported, by any evidence which would\n          be admissible for those purposes if declarant\n          had testified as a witness.\n\n                                9\n\napply  state law unless  applicable federal procedural  rules are\n\nsufficiently  broad  to  control a  particular  issue  before the\n\ncourt.    See Walker  v.  Armco Steel  Corp.,  446 U.S.  740, 749\n                                            \n\n(1980); Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S.  460, 470-71 (1965).  In  Armco\n                                                                 \n\nSteel, for example, the  Supreme Court upheld the application  of\n     \n\nOklahoma's  tolling statute,  which  required actual  service  of\n\nprocess, in  lieu of  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 3,  which provided  that a\n\ncivil action  could be commenced  by filing a complaint  with the\n\ncourt.  See Armco Steel, 446 U.S. at 742-44.  The Court noted the\n                       \n\nstate's policy interest  in enforcing its statute  of limitations\n\nand in deferring tolling until a defendant had actual notice of a\n\nsuit.   See id. at 751.   On this basis,  the Court reasoned that\n               \n\nthe Oklahoma statute was a  \"statement of a substantive  decision\n\nby  that  state,\"  forming an  \"'integral'  part  of  the several\n\npolicies served by  the statute of limitations.\"   Id. at 751-52.\n                                                      \n\nThe Court concluded that \"[federal]  Rule 3 does not replace such\n\npolicy determinations,\" but,  rather, exists \"side by  side\" with\n\nthe state  statute, \"each controlling its own  intended sphere of\n\ncoverage without conflict.\"  Id. at 752.\n                                \n\n          The evidentiary  provisions of Maine's  Health Act  are\n\nsimilarly bound up with the state's substantive decision making -\n\nin   this  instance,  the  state's  choice  to  encourage  early,\n\ninexpensive  resolution  of  medical   malpractice  claims.    As\n\nobserved by  Maine's highest  court in  Sullivan, directing  that\n                                                \n\nunanimous  Findings be  admitted  \"without explanation,\"  thereby\n\ncircumventing a replay of the screening proceeding, is a rational\n\n                                10\n\nmeans of ensuring that panel proceedings will not become merely a\n\ndress rehearsal, but  will serve to encourage  final dispositions\n\nwithout the need for jury trials.  See Sullivan, 628 A.2d at 656.\n                                               \n\nSince   the   federal  Evidence   Rules  governing   hearsay  and\n\nimpeachment do  not seek to  displace the Health Act's  policy of\n\nlimiting frivolous malpractice  suits, the federal rules  and the\n\nstate statute can  peacefully coexist, each operating  within its\n\nown sphere of influence. \n\n          In short,  we see  no conflict.   Indeed, a  refusal to\n\ngive  effect to  the Health  Act's  evidentiary provisions  would\n\ndisserve Erie  principles by  undercutting Erie's  twin goals  of\n                                               \n\ndiscouraging   forum   shopping   and   eliminating   inequitable\n\nadministration of the law as  between federal and state  courts.6\n\nSee Hanna, 380 U.S. at 468; see also Armco Steel, 446 U.S. at 751\n                                                \n\n(explaining   that   a   federal  court   sitting   in  diversity\n\njurisdiction  ordinarily  should  give   effect  to  the  state's\n\n\"substantive decision[s]\").\n\n          3.  Form  of Presentation.  Appellant's  last objection\n          3.  Form  of Presentation.\n                                   \n\nto the Findings  centers on the form  of the proffer.

Since, by statute, screening panels are\nadministered through  the superior court, admitting  the Findings\nis analogous  to allowing into  evidence the report of  a master,\nFed. R. Civ. P. 53, or the  reports of public offices or agencies\nsetting forth factual findings resulting from investigations made\npursuant to  law, Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)(c),  or giving effect to a\npresumption respecting a  fact integral to a claim  or defense as\nto which state law supplies the  rule of decision, Fed. R.

R.  Evid. 403.8\n\nThis argument is unavailing.\n\n          District courts  possess wide  latitude  in striking  a\n\nbalance   under  Rule  403   between  the  probative   force  and\n\nprejudicial impact of relevant evidence.  See Onujiogu v.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 817 F.2d 3, 6 (1st  Cir. 1987) (collecting cases).  \"Only\n      \n\nrarely   and  in extraordinarily compelling circumstances    will\n\nwe, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district\n\ncourt's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing  of\n\nprobative  value and  unfair effect.\"   Freeman v.  Package Mach.\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 865 F.2d 1331,  1340 (1st Cir. 1988).  The test  is abuse of\n   \n\ndiscretion, see, e.g.,  Doty v. Sewall, 908 F.2d  1053, 1058 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1990), and we find no hint of abuse in this situation.\n\n          Given the issues in the case, the Findings were  highly\n\nrelevant.    The  district  court,  recognizing   the  evidence's\n\n                    \n\n     7The panel  made separate  written Findings  as to MMC,  Dr.\nTaylor, and Dr. Bryce.  MMC proffered all three documents.\n\n     8Fed. R. Evid. 403 provides in pertinent part:\n\n               Although  relevant,   evidence  may   be\n          excluded   if   its    probative   value   is\n          substantially  outweighed  by the  danger  of\n          unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\n          misleading the jury, or  by considerations of\n          undue  delay,  waste  of  time,  or  needless\n          presentation of cumulative evidence.\n\n                                12\n\ncapacity  for  prejudice,  handled  it  gingerly,  redacting  the\n\nproffered exhibits  by removing the  official seal  of the  state\n\nsuperior court and  the court caption.  Moreover,  the court gave\n\nan   appropriate  cautionary  instruction   to  the  jury      an\n\ninstruction  to which appellant  did not contemporaneously object\n\nand to  which she  does not  now assign  error.   And, because  a\n\nscreening panel's findings  do not have independent  legal effect\n\noutside the  paper on which  they are recorded, admitting  a duly\n\nauthenticated  writing  pays  appropriate  tribute  to  the  best\n\nevidence rule.  See Fed. R.  Evid. 1002; see also R &amp; R  Assocs.,\n                                                                 \n\nInc. v. Visual Scene, Inc., 726 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1984).\n                          \n\n          On  a related topic,  appellant also protests  that the\n\ncourt transgressed Rule 403 when it allowed MMC to introduce into\n\nevidence  the Findings  that concerned  Dr. Bryce and  Dr. Taylor\n\n(neither of whom was a defendant in the federal suit).  We do not\n\nthink  that  this ruling  constituted  an  abuse  of the  court's\n\ndiscretion.   Inasmuch as  appellant's case against  MMC included\n\ntheories of vicarious  liability, the acts  and omissions of  the\n\ntwo physicians   MMC's agents   were called into direct question,\n\nmaking the  disputed evidence  squarely relevant  to the  federal\n\nproceedings.\n\n          We  will not paint the lily.   All evidence is meant to\n\nbe  prejudicial; elsewise,  the proponent  would  be unlikely  to\n\noffer  it.   It is  a  necessary corollary  of this  conventional\n\nwisdom that evidence cannot be  kept from the jury merely because\n\nit hurts  a party's  chances.   See Freeman,  865  F.2d at  1339;\n                                           \n\n                                13\n\nOnujiogu,  817 F.2d at  6.

Second, she maintains that the testimony should\n\nhave been  excluded because the deposition was incomplete.  These\n\nincursions lack force.  \n\n          1.    Unavailability.    The  Civil  Rules  provide  in\n          1.    Unavailability.\n                              \n\nrelevant part that  \"[t]he deposition of a  witness . . .  may be\n\nused by any party  for any purpose if  the court finds . .  . the\n\nwitness is at a greater distance than one  hundred miles from the\n\nplace of  trial or hearing.\"   Fed. R.  Civ. P. 32(a)(3)(B).   In\n\ngeneral, the  district court  has discretion  in matters of  case\n\nmanagement, see, e.g., Thibeault v. Square D Corp., 960 F.2d 239,\n                                                  \n\n242  (1st Cir.  1992); In  re San  Juan  Dupont Plaza  Hotel Fire\n                                                                 \n\nLitig., 859  F.2d 1007, 1019  (1st Cir.  1988), and we  think the\n      \n\nsame deference  attaches to  the court's rulings  under Rule  32.\n\nSee Oostendorp  v. Khanna,  937 F.2d 1177,  1179 (7th  Cir. 1991)\n                         \n\n                                14\n\n(holding  that \"the  decision to  admit  deposition testimony  is\n\nwithin  the sound  discretion  of  the  district  court\"),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 112 S. Ct. 951 (1992); Reeg v. Shaughnessy, 570 F.2d 309,\n                                                  \n\n317 (10th Cir. 1978) (similar).   Hence, we will not disturb  the\n\ndistrict court's finding that a  witness is more than one hundred\n\nmiles away, or  otherwise unavailable for  trial, absent a  clear\n\nshowing of discretion misused.\n\n          Appellant   has  not  made  such  a  showing.    Before\n\nauthorizing  resort   to  the  deposition,  the   district  court\n\nconsidered  Dr. Bryce's  statement, made  during his  deposition,\n\nthat he was soon to move to Wisconsin.  The court also considered\n\na letter  sent by the doctor to his attorney shortly before trial\n\nin which  he indicated he would  be unable to leave  Wisconsin in\n\norder  to testify.   Appellant did  not then,  nor does  she now,\n\ndispute  that  Dr. Bryce  had  relocated, and  she  concedes that\n\nWisconsin is more  than one hundred miles from  the New Hampshire\n\nborder.  This  one-sided record is ample to  sustain the district\n\ncourt's finding that Rule 32(a)(3)(B) had been satisfied.\n\n          Appellant's  rejoinder  is  twofold.    Initially,  she\n\nsuggests that Rule 32(a)(3)(B) requires an evidentiary showing of\n\nunavailability.  But the rule  itself imposes no such condition  \n\nand we  see no reason  to read such a  condition into it.   Under\n\nordinary circumstances, a  district court possesses the  power to\n\naccept,  and  act upon,  a reliable  explanation of  a deponent's\n\n                                15\n\nwhereabouts  without convening  an  evidentiary  hearing.9    See\n                                                                 \n\nHartman v. United States, 538  F.2d 1336, 1345-46 (8th Cir. 1976)\n                        \n\n(upholding district  court's admission of deposition  solely upon\n\ndeponent's uncontradicted  statement, seven months  before trial,\n\nthat he  lived more than  one hundred miles form  the courthouse;\n\nnoting,  inter  alia, that  deponent  had no  apparent  reason to\n                    \n\nreturn for trial).  \n\n          Next, appellant intimates that a witness, though at the\n\nstated distance from  the place of trial, is  not unavailable if,\n\nwith reasonable  efforts, he might  be persuaded to attend.   But\n\nthe language  of the rule  does not permit  a court to  read this\n\nsort  of  qualification  into  it.    Distance  is  the  decisive\n\ncriterion:   so long as  a witness is shown  to be more  than one\n\nhundred  miles from  the  place of  trial,  the admissibility  of\n\ndeposition testimony under the  aegis of Rule 32(a)(3)(B)  is not\n\ncontingent  upon  a   showing  that  the  witness   is  otherwise\n\nunavailable.10   See   Carey  v. Bahama  Cruise Lines,  Inc., 864\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 201, 204 n.2 (1st Cir. 1988).      \n\n                    \n\n     9Appellant  relies heavily  on Moore  v. Mississippi  Valley\n                                                                 \nState Univ., 871  F.2d 545 (5th Cir.  1989), a case in  which the\n           \nFifth Circuit upheld  a district court's exclusion  of deposition\ntestimony  under  Rule  32(a)(3)  because  the  proffering  party\n\"offered nothing except  the plain assertion that  [the deponent]\nwas unavailable.\"  Id. at 552.  As recounted  above, however, the\n                      \nfacts in the  case at hand are crucially  different.  Whereas the\nattorney in Moore \"made  no effort to explain the  unavailability\n                 \nor offer some  explanation to the trial court,\"  id., MMC offered\n                                                    \nan uncontroverted, entirely plausible explanation.\n\n     10There is, of  course, an exception for cases  in which \"it\nappears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party\noffering the  deposition.\"   Fed. R. Civ.  P. 32(a)(3)(B).   This\ncase falls outside the boundaries of that exception.\n\n                                16\n\n          2.   Completeness.   Appellant's last  line of  fire is\n          2.   Completeness.\n                           \n\ntrained on the putative incompleteness of Dr. Bryce's deposition.\n\nBefore advancing  to the merits  of this assertion, we  note that\n\nthe  broad  discretionary  powers  to  manage  cases,  which  are\n\nnecessarily enjoyed by  district courts, apply to  the regulation\n\nof discovery disputes.  See Thibeault, 960 F.2d at 242; San  Juan\n                                                                 \n\nDupont Plaza, 859 F.2d  at 1019.  We believe that this discretion\n            \n\nextends  to   determining  whether  a  deposition  is  reasonably\n\ncomplete.  Moreover,  even if it is determined  that a deposition\n\nis not complete,  a court has the  power to allow all or  part of\n\nthe   testimony   into  evidence   if   customary   standards  of\n\nadmissibility have  been met and  if no unfairness inheres.   See\n                                                                 \n\nLentomyynti  Oy v.  Medivac, Inc.,  997 F.2d  364, 371  (7th Cir.\n                                 \n\n1993);  see also  Fed.  R. Evid.  611  (recognizing the  district\n                \n\ncourt's control over \"the manner in which deposition testimony is\n\npresented\"); Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 32(a) (providing  for use  of \"any\n\npart or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules\n\nof  evidence\"  and  directing  the  district  court  to  consider\n\n\"fairness\" if less than all of the deposition  testimony is to be\n\nadmitted). \n\n          In the instant case, the court made an implicit finding\n\nthat the deposition had been completed.  We think  such a finding\n\nis supportable.   Dr.  Bryce was examined  on November  29, 1989.\n\nThe examination was suspended after a  dispute arose anent access\n\nto two memoranda.  Appellant  thereafter filed a motion to compel\n\nproduction of the memoranda, which  the court granted on July 26,\n\n                                17\n\n1990.   MMC  promptly complied with  the turnover order.   A fair\n\nreading of the memoranda in  light of appellant's line of inquiry\n\nat the deposition  suggests that her attorneys declined to resume\n\nthe  deposition because  they  did  not  perceive  that  fruitful\n\nqueries remained to be posed.\n\n          Even  if the deposition properly could be classified as\n\nunfinished business, we would reject the assignment of error.  In\n\nthe  first place,  the  district  court  carefully  redacted  the\n\ndeposition to  prevent any cognizable unfairness.   In the second\n\nplace,  if appellant, after receiving the memoranda, thought that\n\nthey bore on Dr. Bryce's testimony, it was incumbent  upon her to\n\nrenotice  and  resume the  deposition  at some  point  during the\n\nnearly  three years  that intervened  between  production of  the\n\nmemoranda  and  the start  of  trial.   We  have held  in various\n\ncontexts that a  party who does  not actively pursue  perceptible\n\nrights in the district court is at grave risk of waiver,  and may\n\nwell be barred from asserting those rights on appeal.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nDow v.

We see no  reason to deviate\n\nhere from  our usual  practice of denying  relief to  parties who\n\n                                18\n\nhave slept too long upon their rights.11\n\nAffirmed.

After assembling the test results, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about April 9, 1987, while in her thirty-first week of pregnancy, plaintiff-appellant Dawn Daigle, a New Hampshire resident, developed symptoms associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension.  She sought treatment at Frisbie Memorial Hospital, Rochester, New Hampshire.  There, Daigle's treating obstetrician advised her that she required an immediate cesarean section.  Because Frisbie Memorial Hospital maintained only rudimentary neonatal facilities, the obstetrician suggested that the surgery be performed at a tertiary-care hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following her doctor's suggestion, Daigle presented herself at Maine Medical Center (MMC) in the early morning hours of April 10, 1987.  Examination confirmed her obstetrician's diagnosis and hospital personnel prepared her for immediate surgery.  The preparations did not go smoothly:  while a catheter was being inserted into the jugular vein to monitor blood pressure and provide access to medications, Daigle's carotid artery was punctured.  A hematoma then formed in Daigle's neck, deviating her trachea.  Consequently, although the delivery was otherwise successful, the attending physicians were forced to intubate Daigle while she was fully awake.  Daigle was discharged from the hospital on April 17, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>The Health Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because many of the arguments on appeal relate to the Health Act, we offer an overview of the statutory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine legislature passed the Health Act in response to an emergent crisis that threatened the availability of medical malpractice insurance.  The legislature designed the Health Act in an effort to stem the proliferation of medical malpractice litigation, weed out nonmeritorious claims, and promote early settlement of meritorious claims.  See Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, Sec. 2851(1)(A) &amp; (B);  see also Sullivan v. Johnson, 628 A.2d 653, 655-56 (Me.1993).  By its terms, the Act requires parties to submit medical malpractice claims to a prelitigation screening panel as a condition precedent to court access, unless both sides agree to bypass the panel hearing.  See Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, Sec. 2853.  Each screening panel is composed of a person with judicial experience (such as a retired jurist), an attorney, and either one or two health care professionals, depending on the circumstances of the particular case.  See id. Sec. 2852(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A screening panel is authorized to conduct evidentiary hearings and render a decision.  See id. Secs. 2854-2855.  A party who submits to the screening process is entitled to proceed with her court case regardless of the outcome of the panel deliberations.  See id. Sec. 2858.  Withal, the panel's findings (the Findings) are admissible as evidence in subsequent litigation if they are unanimous.  See id.   When admissible, the Findings are to be introduced \"without explanation.\"   Id. Sec. 2857(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1988 Daigle sued MMC in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.  Invoking diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (1988), she alleged negligence relating to treatment rendered during her hospital stay.  MMC challenged the court's in personam jurisdiction, and, failing in its jurisdictional objection, defended on the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, the district court determined that Maine law applied to Daigle's suit and that, therefore, the Health Act pertained.  Under the compulsion of that ruling, Daigle first presented her case to a prelitigation screening panel which consisted of a retired jurist, two physicians, and an attorney.  After an evidentiary hearing, the panel found no acts of negligence attributable either to MMC or to Daigle's attending physicians at MMC, viz., Dr. Constance Taylor and Dr. David Bryce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the panel's adverse decision, Daigle decided to go forward.  At trial, the district court, noting the panel's unanimity, allowed the Findings to be introduced into evidence.  Thereafter, Daigle attempted to impeach the panel proceedings, but to no avail;  the court sustained MMC's objections.  The jury returned a verdict in MMC's favor on March 10, 1993.  Daigle moved unsuccessfully for a new trial and then appealed.  We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>The Constitutional Challenges</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's main offensive comprises a host of challenges to the constitutionality of the Health Act.  She asserts, inter alia, that the statute violates principles of equal protection and due process, and also impermissibly abridges her right to trial by jury.  Despite this asseverational array, the constitutional sortie need not occupy us for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of the matter is that appellant failed to raise these claims or otherwise to challenge the constitutionality of the Health Act in the district court.  Our law is clear that a party ordinarily may not raise on appeal issues that were not seasonably advanced (and, hence, preserved) below.  See, e.g., United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1993);  Clauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 666 (1st Cir.1987) (collecting cases).  The raise-or-waive rule applies with full force to constitutional challenges.  See Cohen v. President &amp; Fellows of Harvard Coll., 729 F.2d 59, 60-61 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 874, 105 S.Ct. 233, 83 L.Ed.2d 161 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the raise-or-waive rule is not totally inelastic;  there are exceptions to it, but, for the most part, the exceptions are narrowly configured and sparingly dispensed.  We will, for example, relax the rule upon a showing of plain error, see United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 99-100 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844, 108 S.Ct. 137, 98 L.Ed.2d 94 (1987), but appellant's constitutional claims do not qualify for such treatment.  \"Plain error\" requires the proponent to show that softening the rule is necessary to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice, see id. at 100, and the \"errors\" assigned here are, in all events, likely to prove a losing proposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We can also relax the rule in an \"exceptional case,\" United States v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir.1990), but we invoke that exception only when, at a bare minimum, the omitted ground is so compelling as virtually to ensure an appellant's success.  See Slade, 980 F.2d at 31.   Obviously, Daigle cannot clear this hurdle.  See supra note 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that appellant's constitutional claims are procedurally defaulted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>The Section 2857 Challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, appellant launches a barrage of interrelated reasons aimed at showing why the district court erred, on evidentiary grounds, in admitting the Findings into evidence.  These theories do not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Meaning of \"Without Explanation\".   First, appellant claims that the district court erred in giving literal effect to the Health Act, which provides that unanimous panel decisions, i.e., Findings, may be admitted into evidence at an ensuing trial \"without explanation.\"   Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, Sec. 2857.  The district court interpreted \"without explanation\" as preventing either side from eliciting testimony concerning the circumstances of, and deliberative process at, the panel hearing, but as permitting counsel for the parties to comment upon the Findings in opening statements and closing arguments (a prerogative which MMC desired and which appellant would sooner have seen by the wayside).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that this protocol constitutes error, appellant is whistling past the graveyard.  Her position is entirely undone by the recent opinion in Sullivan v. Johnson, 628 A.2d 653 (Me.1993), a case in which Maine's Supreme Judicial Court interpreted \"without explanation\" in precisely the manner that the district judge anticipated.  The Sullivan court elected to read the statute \"as a whole with a view toward effectuating the Legislature's purpose of encouraging pre-trial resolution of these claims.\"  Id. at 655-56.   Proceeding in this fashion, the court found that because the \"Legislature's intent [was] to force final disposition of ... claims [that the panel unanimously determines to be without merit] short of trial,\" the statutory language only barred \"explanation of the panel deliberations or proceedings.\"  Id. at 656.   In that vein, the court specifically held that \"it is permissible for the [parties] to utilize [in opening statements and-or closing arguments] the admissible panel findings as they would any other piece of admissible evidence.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction and called upon in that role to apply state law is absolutely bound by a current interpretation of that law formulated by the state's highest tribunal.  See Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U.S. 456, 464-65, 87 S.Ct. 1776, 1782, 18 L.Ed.2d 886 (1967).  So it is here.  Sullivan categorically disposes of appellant's plaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Erie Initiative.   Appellant also contends that the lower court erred, as a matter of federal evidentiary law, both in admitting the Findings into evidence and in foreclosing an opportunity for impeachment.  Though recondite, appellant's theory appears to be that section 2857 is a state evidentiary rule and, as such, must give way to the Federal Rules of Evidence in a diversity suit.  See Fed.R.Evid. 101 (explaining that the federal Evidence Rules \"govern proceedings\" in federal courts);  see also Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 822, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938).  Since the panel's determination is hearsay, this thesis goes, the district court bumbled in not requiring MMC first to demonstrate an applicable exclusion or exception to the hearsay rule in order to justify admission of the evidence.  And, moreover, appellant remonstrates, even if the Findings were appropriately admitted into evidence, she had a right, under Fed.R.Evid. 806, to impeach the panelists' credibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fatal weakness in appellant's construct lies with her premise that the Health Act's evidentiary strictures are mere procedural rules.  Authoritative case law makes clear that federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction are obligated to apply state law unless applicable federal procedural rules are sufficiently broad to control a particular issue before the court.  See Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U.S. 740, 749, 100 S.Ct. 1978, 1984, 64 L.Ed.2d 659 (1980);   Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 470-71, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 1143-44, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965).  In Armco Steel, for example, the Supreme Court upheld the application of Oklahoma's tolling statute, which required actual service of process, in lieu of Fed.R.Civ.P. 3, which provided that a civil action could be commenced by filing a complaint with the court.   See Armco Steel, 446 U.S. at 742-44, 100 S.Ct. at 1981-82.   The Court noted the state's policy interest in enforcing its statute of limitations and in deferring tolling until a defendant had actual notice of a suit.  See id. at 751, 100 S.Ct. at 1985.   On this basis, the Court reasoned that the Oklahoma statute was a \"statement of a substantive decision by that state,\" forming an \" 'integral' part of the several policies served by the statute of limitations.\"   Id. at 751-52, 100 S.Ct. at 1985-86.   The Court concluded that \"[federal] Rule 3 does not replace such policy determinations,\" but, rather, exists \"side by side\" with the state statute, \"each controlling its own intended sphere of coverage without conflict.\"   Id. at 752, 100 S.Ct. at 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidentiary provisions of Maine's Health Act are similarly bound up with the state's substantive decision making--in this instance, the state's choice to encourage early, inexpensive resolution of medical malpractice claims.  As observed by Maine's highest court in Sullivan, directing that unanimous Findings be admitted \"without explanation,\" thereby circumventing a replay of the screening proceeding, is a rational means of ensuring that panel proceedings will not become merely a dress rehearsal, but will serve to encourage final dispositions without the need for jury trials.  See Sullivan, 628 A.2d at 656.   Since the federal Evidence Rules governing hearsay and impeachment do not seek to displace the Health Act's policy of limiting frivolous malpractice suits, the federal rules and the state statute can peacefully coexist, each operating within its own sphere of influence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we see no conflict.  Indeed, a refusal to give effect to the Health Act's evidentiary provisions would disserve Erie principles by undercutting Erie 's twin goals of discouraging forum shopping and eliminating inequitable administration of the law as between federal and state courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Hanna, 380 U.S. at 468, 85 S.Ct. at 1142;  see also Armco Steel, 446 U.S. at 751, 100 S.Ct. at 1985 (explaining that a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction ordinarily should give effect to the state's \"substantive decision[s]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Form of Presentation.   Appellant's last objection to the Findings centers on the form of the proffer.  She avers that the district court committed reversible error in allowing the Findings, in written form, to be introduced as full exhibits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Although appellant never articulates the theoretical basis for the objection, her central point is apparently that admitting the writings themselves, rather than merely eliciting testimony recounting the Findings, violated Fed.R.Evid. 403.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  This argument is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts possess wide latitude in striking a balance under Rule 403 between the probative force and prejudicial impact of relevant evidence.  See Onujiogu v. United States, 817 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir.1987) (collecting cases).  \"Only rarely--and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\"  Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988).  The test is abuse of discretion, see, e.g., Doty v. Sewall, 908 F.2d 1053, 1058 (1st Cir.1990), and we find no hint of abuse in this situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the issues in the case, the Findings were highly relevant.  The district court, recognizing the evidence's capacity for prejudice, handled it gingerly, redacting the proffered exhibits by removing the official seal of the state superior court and the court caption.  Moreover, the court gave an appropriate cautionary instruction to the jury--an instruction to which appellant did not contemporaneously object and to which she does not now assign error.  And, because a screening panel's findings do not have independent legal effect outside the paper on which they are recorded, admitting a duly authenticated writing pays appropriate tribute to the best evidence rule.  See Fed.R.Evid. 1002;  see also R &amp; R Assocs., Inc. v. Visual Scene, Inc., 726 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a related topic, appellant also protests that the court transgressed Rule 403 when it allowed MMC to introduce into evidence the Findings that concerned Dr. Bryce and Dr. Taylor (neither of whom was a defendant in the federal suit).  We do not think that this ruling constituted an abuse of the court's discretion.  Inasmuch as appellant's case against MMC included theories of vicarious liability, the acts and omissions of the two physicians--MMC's agents--were called into direct question, making the disputed evidence squarely relevant to the federal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  All evidence is meant to be prejudicial;  elsewise, the proponent would be unlikely to offer it.  It is a necessary corollary of this conventional wisdom that evidence cannot be kept from the jury merely because it hurts a party's chances.  See Freeman, 865 F.2d at 1339; Onujiogu, 817 F.2d at 6.   The element that triggers a need to exclude evidence under Rule 403 is not prejudice, but unfair prejudice.  See United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1989).  No such unfairness lurks in this record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>The Deposition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final foray is a two-pronged assault directed against the district court's ruling permitting Dr. Bryce's deposition testimony to be placed before the jury.  First, appellant argues that MMC failed to establish the doctor's unavailability.  Second, she maintains that the testimony should have been excluded because the deposition was incomplete.  These incursions lack force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Unavailability.  The Civil Rules provide in relevant part that \"[t]he deposition of a witness ... may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds ... the witness is at a greater distance than one hundred miles from the place of trial or hearing.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a)(3)(B).  In general, the district court has discretion in matters of case management, see, e.g., Thibeault v. Square D Corp., 960 F.2d 239, 242 (1st Cir.1992);  In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 859 F.2d 1007, 1019 (1st Cir.1988), and we think the same deference attaches to the court's rulings under Rule 32.  See Oostendorp v. Khanna, 937 F.2d 1177, 1179 (7th Cir.1991) (holding that \"the decision to admit deposition testimony is within the sound discretion of the district court\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 951, 117 L.Ed.2d 119 (1992);  Reeg v. Shaughnessy, 570 F.2d 309, 317 (10th Cir.1978) (similar).  Hence, we will not disturb the district court's finding that a witness is more than one hundred miles away, or otherwise unavailable for trial, absent a clear showing of discretion misused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has not made such a showing.  Before authorizing resort to the deposition, the district court considered Dr. Bryce's statement, made during his deposition, that he was soon to move to Wisconsin.  The court also considered a letter sent by the doctor to his attorney shortly before trial in which he indicated he would be unable to leave Wisconsin in order to testify.  Appellant did not then, nor does she now, dispute that Dr. Bryce had relocated, and she concedes that Wisconsin is more than one hundred miles from the New Hampshire border.  This one-sided record is ample to sustain the district court's finding that Rule 32(a)(3)(B) had been satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's rejoinder is twofold.  Initially, she suggests that Rule 32(a)(3)(B) requires an evidentiary showing of unavailability.  But the rule itself imposes no such condition--and we see no reason to read such a condition into it.  Under ordinary circumstances, a district court possesses the power to accept, and act upon, a reliable explanation of a deponent's whereabouts without convening an evidentiary hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See Hartman v. United States, 538 F.2d 1336, 1345-46 (8th Cir.1976) (upholding district court's admission of deposition solely upon deponent's uncontradicted statement, seven months before trial, that he lived more than one hundred miles from the courthouse;  noting, inter alia, that deponent had no apparent reason to return for trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, appellant intimates that a witness, though at the stated distance from the place of trial, is not unavailable if, with reasonable efforts, he might be persuaded to attend.  But the language of the rule does not permit a court to read this sort of qualification into it.  Distance is the decisive criterion:  so long as a witness is shown to be more than one hundred miles from the place of trial, the admissibility of deposition testimony under the aegis of Rule 32(a)(3)(B) is not contingent upon a showing that the witness is otherwise unavailable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Carey v. Bahama Cruise Lines, Inc., 864 F.2d 201, 204 n. 2 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Completeness.  Appellant's last line of fire is trained on the putative incompleteness of Dr. Bryce's deposition.  Before advancing to the merits of this assertion, we note that the broad discretionary powers to manage cases, which are necessarily enjoyed by district courts, apply to the regulation of discovery disputes.  See Thibeault, 960 F.2d at 242;  San Juan Dupont Plaza, 859 F.2d at 1019.   We believe that this discretion extends to determining whether a deposition is reasonably complete.  Moreover, even if it is determined that a deposition is not complete, a court has the power to allow all or part of the testimony into evidence if customary standards of admissibility have been met and if no unfairness inheres.  See Lentomyynti Oy v. Medivac, Inc., 997 F.2d 364, 371 (7th Cir.1993);  see also Fed.R.Evid. 611 (recognizing the district court's control over \"the manner in which deposition testimony is presented\");  Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a) (providing for use of \"any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence\" and directing the district court to consider \"fairness\" if less than all of the deposition testimony is to be admitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the court made an implicit finding that the deposition had been completed.  We think such a finding is supportable.  Dr. Bryce was examined on November 29, 1989.  The examination was suspended after a dispute arose anent access to two memoranda.  Appellant thereafter filed a motion to compel production of the memoranda, which the court granted on July 26, 1990.  MMC promptly complied with the turnover order.  A fair reading of the memoranda in light of appellant's line of inquiry at the deposition suggests that her attorneys declined to resume the deposition because they did not perceive that fruitful queries remained to be posed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the deposition properly could be classified as unfinished business, we would reject the assignment of error.  In the first place, the district court carefully redacted the deposition to prevent any cognizable unfairness.  In the second place, if appellant, after receiving the memoranda, thought that they bore on Dr. Bryce's testimony, it was incumbent upon her to renotice and resume the deposition at some point during the nearly three years that intervened between production of the memoranda and the start of trial.  We have held in various contexts that a party who does not actively pursue perceptible rights in the district court is at grave risk of waiver, and may well be barred from asserting those rights on appeal.  See, e.g., Dow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, 1 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that plaintiffs waived any right to complain of refused discovery because, after district court declined their initial discovery request with leave to renew, plaintiffs failed to make a second request);  Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 168 (1st Cir.1988) (finding waiver of right to challenge judge's appointment of technical advisor).  We see no reason to deviate here from our usual practice of denying relief to parties who have slept too long upon their rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.  Costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> MMC has cross-appealed from the denial of its motion to dismiss.  Given our disposition of Daigle's appeal, see infra, nothing turns on the cross-appeal.  Hence, we dismiss it by separate order.  Cf. Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 40-41 (1st Cir.1991)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although Daigle did not sue either Dr. Taylor or Dr. Bryce in the federal court, she later sued them in a Maine state court.  That suit is still pending</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> At initial blush, none of appellant's constitutional contentions are convincing.  With respect to her claim that the Health Act violates equal protection in requiring only medical malpractice claimants to submit to screening before proceeding to trial, we believe that the statute is rationally related to the legitimate legislative goal of containing the sudden proliferation of medical malpractice litigation.  See Houk v. Furman, 613 F.Supp. 1022, 1030-33 (D.Me.1985).  Appellant's due process and Seventh Amendment claims appear to be even more severely flawed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In connection with these claims, appellant also presses an argument that the panel as constituted was biased, resulting in a fundamentally unfair hearing and, hence, in a violation of her due process rights.  Unlike her other constitutional claims, appellant successfully preserved this issue for review.  But the bottom line remains unchanged.  Assuming, for argument's sake, that the district court possessed the power to entertain appellant's objection to the panel's supposed bias--a matter on which we do not opine--our perscrutation of the record persuades us, beyond serious question, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion to set aside the Findings and order a fresh start</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Evid. 806 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>When a hearsay statement ... has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We note in passing that, Erie principles to one side, admitting the Findings into evidence does not seem inconsistent with the Evidence Rules.  Since, by statute, screening panels are administered through the superior court, admitting the Findings is analogous to allowing into evidence the report of a master, Fed.R.Civ.P. 53, or the reports of public offices or agencies setting forth factual findings resulting from investigations made pursuant to law, Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(c), or giving effect to a presumption respecting a fact integral to a claim or defense as to which state law supplies the rule of decision, Fed.R.Evid. 302</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The panel made separate written Findings as to MMC, Dr. Taylor, and Dr. Bryce.

Mississippi Valley State Univ., 871 F.2d 545 (5th Cir.1989), a case in which the Fifth Circuit upheld a district court's exclusion of deposition testimony under Rule 32(a)(3) because the proffering party \"offered nothing except the plain assertion that [the deponent] was unavailable.\"  Id. at 552.   As recounted above, however, the facts in the case at hand are crucially different.  Whereas the attorney in Moore \"made no effort to explain the unavailability or offer some explanation to the trial court,\" id., MMC offered an uncontroverted, entirely plausible explanation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> There is, of course, an exception for cases in which \"it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a)(3)(B).  This case falls outside the boundaries of that exception</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> This practice seems fully compatible with Civil Rule 32.

Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2153, at 475 (1970);  cf.

After assembling the test results, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about April 9, 1987, while in her thirty-first week of pregnancy, plaintiff-appellant Dawn Daigle, a New Hampshire resident, developed symptoms associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension.  She sought treatment at Frisbie Memorial Hospital, Rochester, New Hampshire.  There, Daigle's treating obstetrician advised her that she required an immediate cesarean section.  Because Frisbie Memorial Hospital maintained only rudimentary neonatal facilities, the obstetrician suggested that the surgery be performed at a tertiary-care hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following her doctor's suggestion, Daigle presented herself at Maine Medical Center (MMC) in the early morning hours of April 10, 1987.  Examination confirmed her obstetrician's diagnosis and hospital personnel prepared her for immediate surgery.  The preparations did not go smoothly:  while a catheter was being inserted into the jugular vein to monitor blood pressure and provide access to medications, Daigle's carotid artery was punctured.  A hematoma then formed in Daigle's neck, deviating her trachea.  Consequently, although the delivery was otherwise successful, the attending physicians were forced to intubate Daigle while she was fully awake.  Daigle was discharged from the hospital on April 17, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>The Health Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because many of the arguments on appeal relate to the Health Act, we offer an overview of the statutory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine legislature passed the Health Act in response to an emergent crisis that threatened the availability of medical malpractice insurance.  The legislature designed the Health Act in an effort to stem the proliferation of medical malpractice litigation, weed out nonmeritorious claims, and promote early settlement of meritorious claims.  See Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, Sec. 2851(1)(A) &amp; (B);  see also Sullivan v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></span>, 655-56 (Me.1993).  By its terms, the Act requires parties to submit medical malpractice claims to a prelitigation screening panel as a condition precedent to court access, unless both sides agree to bypass the panel hearing.  See Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, Sec. 2853.  Each screening panel is composed of a person with judicial experience (such as a retired jurist), an attorney, and either one or two health care professionals, depending on the circumstances of the particular case.  See id. Sec. 2852(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A screening panel is authorized to conduct evidentiary hearings and render a decision.  See id. Secs. 2854-2855.  A party who submits to the screening process is entitled to proceed with her court case regardless of the outcome of the panel deliberations.  See id. Sec. 2858.  Withal, the panel's findings (the Findings) are admissible as evidence in subsequent litigation if they are unanimous.  See id.   When admissible, the Findings are to be introduced \"without explanation.\"   Id. Sec. 2857(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1988 Daigle sued MMC in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.  Invoking diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (1988), she alleged negligence relating to treatment rendered during her hospital stay.  MMC challenged the court's in personam jurisdiction, and, failing in its jurisdictional objection, defended on the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, the district court determined that Maine law applied to Daigle's suit and that, therefore, the Health Act pertained.  Under the compulsion of that ruling, Daigle first presented her case to a prelitigation screening panel which consisted of a retired jurist, two physicians, and an attorney.  After an evidentiary hearing, the panel found no acts of negligence attributable either to MMC or to Daigle's attending physicians at MMC, viz., Dr. Constance Taylor and Dr. David Bryce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the panel's adverse decision, Daigle decided to go forward.  At trial, the district court, noting the panel's unanimity, allowed the Findings to be introduced into evidence.  Thereafter, Daigle attempted to impeach the panel proceedings, but to no avail;  the court sustained MMC's objections.  The jury returned a verdict in MMC's favor on March 10, 1993.  Daigle moved unsuccessfully for a new trial and then appealed.  We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>The Constitutional Challenges</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's main offensive comprises a host of challenges to the constitutionality of the Health Act.  She asserts, inter alia, that the statute violates principles of equal protection and due process, and also impermissibly abridges her right to trial by jury.  Despite this asseverational array, the constitutional sortie need not occupy us for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of the matter is that appellant failed to raise these claims or otherwise to challenge the constitutionality of the Health Act in the district court.  Our law is clear that a party ordinarily may not raise on appeal issues that were not seasonably advanced (and, hence, preserved) below.  See, e.g., United States v. Slade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1993);  Clauson v.

The raise-or-waive rule applies with full force to constitutional challenges.  See Cohen v. President &amp; Fellows of Harvard Coll., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"432001\"><a href=\"/opinion/432001/phin-cohen-md-v-president-and-fellows-of-harvard-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 60-61 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We will, for example, relax the rule upon a showing of plain error, see United States v. Griffin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488020\"><a href=\"/opinion/488020/united-states-v-barry-j-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 99-100 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></span> (1987), but appellant's constitutional claims do not qualify for such treatment.  \"Plain error\" requires the proponent to show that softening the rule is necessary to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice, see id. at 100, and the \"errors\" assigned here are, in all events, likely to prove a losing proposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We can also relax the rule in an \"exceptional case,\" United States v.

The Meaning of \"Without Explanation\".   First, appellant claims that the district court erred in giving literal effect to the Health Act, which provides that unanimous panel decisions, i.e., Findings, may be admitted into evidence at an ensuing trial \"without explanation.\"   Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, Sec. 2857.  The district court interpreted \"without explanation\" as preventing either side from eliciting testimony concerning the circumstances of, and deliberative process at, the panel hearing, but as permitting counsel for the parties to comment upon the Findings in opening statements and closing arguments (a prerogative which MMC desired and which appellant would sooner have seen by the wayside).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that this protocol constitutes error, appellant is whistling past the graveyard.  Her position is entirely undone by the recent opinion in Sullivan v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></span> (Me.1993), a case in which Maine's Supreme Judicial Court interpreted \"without explanation\" in precisely the manner that the district judge anticipated.  The Sullivan court elected to read the statute \"as a whole with a view toward effectuating the Legislature's purpose of encouraging pre-trial resolution of these claims.\"  Id. at 655-56.   Proceeding in this fashion, the court found that because the \"Legislature's intent [was] to force final disposition of ... claims [that the panel unanimously determines to be without merit] short of trial,\" the statutory language only barred \"explanation of the panel deliberations or proceedings.\"  Id. at 656.   In that vein, the court specifically held that \"it is permissible for the [parties] to utilize [in opening statements and-or closing arguments] the admissible panel findings as they would any other piece of admissible evidence.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction and called upon in that role to apply state law is absolutely bound by a current interpretation of that law formulated by the state's highest tribunal.  See Commissioner v.

Appellant also contends that the lower court erred, as a matter of federal evidentiary law, both in admitting the Findings into evidence and in foreclosing an opportunity for impeachment.  Though recondite, appellant's theory appears to be that section 2857 is a state evidentiary rule and, as such, must give way to the Federal Rules of Evidence in a diversity suit.  See Fed.R.Evid. 101 (explaining that the federal Evidence Rules \"govern proceedings\" in federal courts);  see also Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103012\"><a href=\"/opinion/103012/erie-r-co-v-tompkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 78, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></span> (1938).  Since the panel's determination is hearsay, this thesis goes, the district court bumbled in not requiring MMC first to demonstrate an applicable exclusion or exception to the hearsay rule in order to justify admission of the evidence.  And, moreover, appellant remonstrates, even if the Findings were appropriately admitted into evidence, she had a right, under Fed.R.Evid. 806, to impeach the panelists' credibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fatal weakness in appellant's construct lies with her premise that the Health Act's evidentiary strictures are mere procedural rules.  Authoritative case law makes clear that federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction are obligated to apply state law unless applicable federal procedural rules are sufficiently broad to control a particular issue before the court.

Armco Steel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110274\"><a href=\"/opinion/110274/walker-v-armco-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span>, 749, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110274\"><a href=\"/opinion/110274/walker-v-armco-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span> (1965).  In Armco Steel, for example, the Supreme Court upheld the application of Oklahoma's tolling statute, which required actual service of process, in lieu of Fed.R.Civ.P. 3, which provided that a civil action could be commenced by filing a complaint with the court.   See Armco Steel, 446 U.S. at 742-44, 100 S.Ct. at 1981-82.   The Court noted the state's policy interest in enforcing its statute of limitations and in deferring tolling until a defendant had actual notice of a suit.  See id. at 751, 100 S.Ct. at 1985.   On this basis, the Court reasoned that the Oklahoma statute was a \"statement of a substantive decision by that state,\" forming an \" 'integral' part of the several policies served by the statute of limitations.\"   Id. at 751-52, 100 S.Ct. at 1985-86.   The Court concluded that \"[federal] Rule 3 does not replace such policy determinations,\" but, rather, exists \"side by side\" with the state statute, \"each controlling its own intended sphere of coverage without conflict.\"   Id. at 752, 100 S.Ct. at 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidentiary provisions of Maine's Health Act are similarly bound up with the state's substantive decision making--in this instance, the state's choice to encourage early, inexpensive resolution of medical malpractice claims.  As observed by Maine's highest court in Sullivan, directing that unanimous Findings be admitted \"without explanation,\" thereby circumventing a replay of the screening proceeding, is a rational means of ensuring that panel proceedings will not become merely a dress rehearsal, but will serve to encourage final dispositions without the need for jury trials.  See Sullivan, 628 A.2d at 656.   Since the federal Evidence Rules governing hearsay and impeachment do not seek to displace the Health Act's policy of limiting frivolous malpractice suits, the federal rules and the state statute can peacefully coexist, each operating within its own sphere of influence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we see no conflict.  Indeed, a refusal to give effect to the Health Act's evidentiary provisions would disserve Erie principles by undercutting Erie 's twin goals of discouraging forum shopping and eliminating inequitable administration of the law as between federal and state courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Hanna, 380 U.S. at 468, 85 S.Ct. at 1142;  see also Armco Steel, 446 U.S. at 751, 100 S.Ct. at 1985 (explaining that a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction ordinarily should give effect to the state's \"substantive decision[s]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Form of Presentation.   Appellant's last objection to the Findings centers on the form of the proffer.  She avers that the district court committed reversible error in allowing the Findings, in written form, to be introduced as full exhibits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Although appellant never articulates the theoretical basis for the objection, her central point is apparently that admitting the writings themselves, rather than merely eliciting testimony recounting the Findings, violated Fed.R.Evid. 403.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  This argument is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts possess wide latitude in striking a balance under Rule 403 between the probative force and prejudicial impact of relevant evidence.  See Onujiogu v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487236\"><a href=\"/opinion/487236/anne-onujiogu-etc-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">817</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1987) (collecting cases).  \"Only rarely--and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\"  Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517427\"><a href=\"/opinion/517427/49-fair-emplpraccas-1139-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38456-27-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1340 (1st Cir.1988).  The test is abuse of discretion, see, e.g., Doty v. Sewall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545153\"><a href=\"/opinion/545153/arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall-arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span>, 1058 (1st Cir.1990), and we find no hint of abuse in this situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the issues in the case, the Findings were highly relevant.  The district court, recognizing the evidence's capacity for prejudice, handled it gingerly, redacting the proffered exhibits by removing the official seal of the state superior court and the court caption.  Moreover, the court gave an appropriate cautionary instruction to the jury--an instruction to which appellant did not contemporaneously object and to which she does not now assign error.  And, because a screening panel's findings do not have independent legal effect outside the paper on which they are recorded, admitting a duly authenticated writing pays appropriate tribute to the best evidence rule.  See Fed.R.Evid. 1002;  see also R &amp; R Assocs., Inc. v. Visual Scene, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430615\"><a href=\"/opinion/430615/r-r-associates-inc-v-visual-scene-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a related topic, appellant also protests that the court transgressed Rule 403 when it allowed MMC to introduce into evidence the Findings that concerned Dr. Bryce and Dr. Taylor (neither of whom was a defendant in the federal suit).  We do not think that this ruling constituted an abuse of the court's discretion.  Inasmuch as appellant's case against MMC included theories of vicarious liability, the acts and omissions of the two physicians--MMC's agents--were called into direct question, making the disputed evidence squarely relevant to the federal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  All evidence is meant to be prejudicial;  elsewise, the proponent would be unlikely to offer it.  It is a necessary corollary of this conventional wisdom that evidence cannot be kept from the jury merely because it hurts a party's chances.  See Freeman, 865 F.2d at 1339; Onujiogu, 817 F.2d at 6.   The element that triggers a need to exclude evidence under Rule 403 is not prejudice, but unfair prejudice.  See United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 156 (1st Cir.1989).  No such unfairness lurks in this record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>The Deposition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final foray is a two-pronged assault directed against the district court's ruling permitting Dr. Bryce's deposition testimony to be placed before the jury.  First, appellant argues that MMC failed to establish the doctor's unavailability.  Second, she maintains that the testimony should have been excluded because the deposition was incomplete.  These incursions lack force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Unavailability.  The Civil Rules provide in relevant part that \"[t]he deposition of a witness ... may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds ... the witness is at a greater distance than one hundred miles from the place of trial or hearing.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a)(3)(B).  In general, the district court has discretion in matters of case management, see, e.g., Thibeault v. Square D Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580699\"><a href=\"/opinion/580699/charles-m-thibeault-v-square-d-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, 242 (1st Cir.1992);  In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513182\"><a href=\"/opinion/513182/in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire-litigation-petition-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span>, 1019 (1st Cir.1988), and we think the same deference attaches to the court's rulings under Rule 32.  See Oostendorp v. Khanna, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564363\"><a href=\"/opinion/564363/debra-oostendorp-v-trilok-s-khanna-janesville-medical-center-ltd-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span>, 1179 (7th Cir.1991) (holding that \"the decision to admit deposition testimony is within the sound discretion of the district court\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hence, we will not disturb the district court's finding that a witness is more than one hundred miles away, or otherwise unavailable for trial, absent a clear showing of discretion misused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has not made such a showing.  Before authorizing resort to the deposition, the district court considered Dr. Bryce's statement, made during his deposition, that he was soon to move to Wisconsin.  The court also considered a letter sent by the doctor to his attorney shortly before trial in which he indicated he would be unable to leave Wisconsin in order to testify.  Appellant did not then, nor does she now, dispute that Dr. Bryce had relocated, and she concedes that Wisconsin is more than one hundred miles from the New Hampshire border.  This one-sided record is ample to sustain the district court's finding that Rule 32(a)(3)(B) had been satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's rejoinder is twofold.  Initially, she suggests that Rule 32(a)(3)(B) requires an evidentiary showing of unavailability.  But the rule itself imposes no such condition--and we see no reason to read such a condition into it.  Under ordinary circumstances, a district court possesses the power to accept, and act upon, a reliable explanation of a deponent's whereabouts without convening an evidentiary hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See Hartman v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"337791\"><a href=\"/opinion/337791/george-d-hartman-jr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1336</span></a></span>, 1345-46 (8th Cir.1976) (upholding district court's admission of deposition solely upon deponent's uncontradicted statement, seven months before trial, that he lived more than one hundred miles from the courthouse;  noting, inter alia, that deponent had no apparent reason to return for trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, appellant intimates that a witness, though at the stated distance from the place of trial, is not unavailable if, with reasonable efforts, he might be persuaded to attend.  But the language of the rule does not permit a court to read this sort of qualification into it.  Distance is the decisive criterion:  so long as a witness is shown to be more than one hundred miles from the place of trial, the admissibility of deposition testimony under the aegis of Rule 32(a)(3)(B) is not contingent upon a showing that the witness is otherwise unavailable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Carey v. Bahama Cruise Lines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516164\"><a href=\"/opinion/516164/thomas-carey-v-bahama-cruise-lines/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 204 n. 2 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Completeness.  Appellant's last line of fire is trained on the putative incompleteness of Dr. Bryce's deposition.  Before advancing to the merits of this assertion, we note that the broad discretionary powers to manage cases, which are necessarily enjoyed by district courts, apply to the regulation of discovery disputes.  See Thibeault, 960 F.2d at 242;  San Juan Dupont Plaza, 859 F.2d at 1019.   We believe that this discretion extends to determining whether a deposition is reasonably complete.  Moreover, even if it is determined that a deposition is not complete, a court has the power to allow all or part of the testimony into evidence if customary standards of admissibility have been met and if no unfairness inheres.  See Lentomyynti Oy v. Medivac, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610638\"><a href=\"/opinion/610638/lentomyynti-oy-a-finnish-corporation-individually-gan-incendie/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 371 (7th Cir.1993);  see also Fed.R.Evid. 611 (recognizing the district court's control over \"the manner in which deposition testimony is presented\");  Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a) (providing for use of \"any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence\" and directing the district court to consider \"fairness\" if less than all of the deposition testimony is to be admitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the court made an implicit finding that the deposition had been completed.  We think such a finding is supportable.  Dr. Bryce was examined on November 29, 1989.  The examination was suspended after a dispute arose anent access to two memoranda.  Appellant thereafter filed a motion to compel production of the memoranda, which the court granted on July 26, 1990.  MMC promptly complied with the turnover order.  A fair reading of the memoranda in light of appellant's line of inquiry at the deposition suggests that her attorneys declined to resume the deposition because they did not perceive that fruitful queries remained to be posed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the deposition properly could be classified as unfinished business, we would reject the assignment of error.  In the first place, the district court carefully redacted the deposition to prevent any cognizable unfairness.  In the second place, if appellant, after receiving the memoranda, thought that they bore on Dr. Bryce's testimony, it was incumbent upon her to renotice and resume the deposition at some point during the nearly three years that intervened between production of the memoranda and the start of trial.  We have held in various contexts that a party who does not actively pursue perceptible rights in the district court is at grave risk of waiver, and may well be barred from asserting those rights on appeal.  See, e.g., Dow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194847\"><a href=\"/opinion/194847/dow-v-ubc/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 61 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that plaintiffs waived any right to complain of refused discovery because, after district court declined their initial discovery request with leave to renew, plaintiffs failed to make a second request);  Reilly v.

We see no reason to deviate here from our usual practice of denying relief to parties who have slept too long upon their rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Resolution Trust Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566797\"><a href=\"/opinion/566797/william-c-feinstein-v-resolution-trust-corporation-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 40-41 (1st Cir.1991)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although Daigle did not sue either Dr. Taylor or Dr. Bryce in the federal court, she later sued them in a Maine state court.  That suit is still pending</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> At initial blush, none of appellant's constitutional contentions are convincing.  With respect to her claim that the Health Act violates equal protection in requiring only medical malpractice claimants to submit to screening before proceeding to trial, we believe that the statute is rationally related to the legitimate legislative goal of containing the sudden proliferation of medical malpractice litigation.  See Houk v. Furman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2156102\"><a href=\"/opinion/2156102/houk-v-furman/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span>, 1030-33 (D.Me.1985).  Appellant's due process and Seventh Amendment claims appear to be even more severely flawed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In connection with these claims, appellant also presses an argument that the panel as constituted was biased, resulting in a fundamentally unfair hearing and, hence, in a violation of her due process rights.  Unlike her other constitutional claims, appellant successfully preserved this issue for review.  But the bottom line remains unchanged.  Assuming, for argument's sake, that the district court possessed the power to entertain appellant's objection to the panel's supposed bias--a matter on which we do not opine--our perscrutation of the record persuades us, beyond serious question, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion to set aside the Findings and order a fresh start</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Evid. 806 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>When a hearsay statement ... has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We note in passing that, Erie principles to one side, admitting the Findings into evidence does not seem inconsistent with the Evidence Rules.  Since, by statute, screening panels are administered through the superior court, admitting the Findings is analogous to allowing into evidence the report of a master, Fed.R.Civ.P. 53, or the reports of public offices or agencies setting forth factual findings resulting from investigations made pursuant to law, Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(c), or giving effect to a presumption respecting a fact integral to a claim or defense as to which state law supplies the rule of decision, Fed.R.Evid. 302</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The panel made separate written Findings as to MMC, Dr. Taylor, and Dr. Bryce.  MMC proffered all three documents</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Evid. 403 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Appellant relies heavily on Moore v. Mississippi Valley State Univ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520618\"><a href=\"/opinion/520618/rachel-moore-v-mississippi-valley-state-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1989), a case in which the Fifth Circuit upheld a district court's exclusion of deposition testimony under Rule 32(a)(3) because the proffering party \"offered nothing except the plain assertion that [the deponent] was unavailable.\"  Id. at 552.   As recounted above, however, the facts in the case at hand are crucially different.  Whereas the attorney in Moore \"made no effort to explain the unavailability or offer some explanation to the trial court,\" id., MMC offered an uncontroverted, entirely plausible explanation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> There is, of course, an exception for cases in which \"it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a)(3)(B).  This case falls outside the boundaries of that exception</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> This practice seems fully compatible with Civil Rule 32.  The rule's \"general principle is to require defects in the taking of depositions to be pointed out promptly on pain of waiver\" so as to \"give the erring party an opportunity to correct the mistake, and to prevent waste of time and money by a subsequent claim that a deposition must be suppressed because of some technical error long ago.\"   8 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2153, at 475 (1970);  cf. Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(d)(3) (ordaining that \"errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless seasonable objection thereto is made at the taking of the deposition\")</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
