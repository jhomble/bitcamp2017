Shawn Poellnitz was indicted in the United\n\nStates District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on\n\nfive counts of wire fraud.            Shortly after his indictment, he\n\nexpressed his desire to plead guilty and consented to the transfer\n\nof his case to the District of Massachusetts (where he was then\n\nserving a sentence for a prior federal offense)1 for his guilty\n\nplea and sentencing, as permitted by Rule 20(a) of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure.          Once the case was transferred to\n\nMassachusetts, he pled guilty and was sentenced to 18 months'\n\nimprisonment, the bottom of the applicable guidelines range as\n\ndetermined by the district court, consecutive to the federal\n\nsentence    he   was   already    serving.     He   now    appeals   from   his\n\nconviction and sentence.         For the following reasons, we grant the\n\ngovernment's     motion   for     summary    disposition    and   affirm    the\n\nsentence.\n\n            On appeal, defendant argues, for the first time, that his\n\nguilty plea was involuntary because it was motivated by his desire\n\nto remain at FMC Devens, where he could receive needed medical\n\ncare, and because he was not aware when he pled guilty that he\n\ncould have sought a transfer to Massachusetts \"for convenience\"\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      See United States v. Poellnitz, No. 06-3027, 257 F. App'x 523\n(3d Cir. Dec. 6, 2007) (unpublished) (affirming defendant's\nconviction for the prior offense). Remarkably, the instant offense\nwas committed the day before and several days after defendant was\nsentenced for the immediately prior one.\n\n                                      -2-\n\funder Rule 21 without pleading guilty and waiving his right to a\n\ntrial.\n\n           Where, as here, defendant did not seek to withdraw his\n\nguilty   plea   in   the   district    court,   this    court   reviews   the\n\nsufficiency of the plea colloquy only for plain error.                United\n\nStates v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 58-59 (2002); United States v.\n\nBorrero-Acevedo, 533 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2008).                Under that\n\nstandard, defendant must show that there is \"(1) error, (2) that is\n\nplain, and (3) that affect[s] substantial rights.               If all three\n\nconditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its\n\ndiscretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error\n\nseriously affect[s] the fairness integrity or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"      Borrero-Acevedo, 533 F.3d at 15 (quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted). That \"tough[] standard,\" id., is not\n\nsatisfied here.\n\n           Although the district court did not advise defendant that\n\nhe could have sought a transfer under Rule 21 without pleading\n\nguilty, nothing in Rule 11 or elsewhere required it to do so.\n\nIndeed, as the district court acknowledged, its jurisdiction, as\n\nthe receiving district under Rule 20, was limited to accepting\n\ndefendant's guilty plea and sentencing him.            If defendant decided\n\nnot to plead guilty, then the court's only option was to transfer\n\nthe case back to the Western District of Pennsylvania.                    The\n\ndistrict court in Massachusetts had no power to transfer the case\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fto itself under Rule 21; any motion under that rule would have had\n\nto have been made in the court where the proceeding began.\n\n            The district court did, however, take pains to ensure\n\nthat defendant's guilty plea was voluntary.           At a hearing on\n\ndefense counsel's motion to withdraw, which preceded the Rule 11\n\nhearing, defense counsel assured the court that the breakdown\n\nbetween him and his client had nothing to do with the guilty plea\n\nand that defendant still wanted to plead guilty.             Nevertheless,\n\nafter denying the motion to withdraw, rather than proceed to the\n\nRule 11 hearing, which had been scheduled for the same day, the\n\ncourt gave defendant three weeks to consult with his counsel and\n\nthink about whether he wanted to plead guilty or to have the case\n\ntransferred back to Pennsylvania.         At the outset of the ensuing\n\nRule 11 hearing, the court confirmed that defendant still wanted to\n\nplead guilty.    At the end of the plea colloquy, the court again\n\nconfirmed defendant's desire to plead guilty and, finding defendant\n\nto be competent and to be acting knowingly and voluntarily, the\n\ncourt accepted his plea.         We therefore see no error, plain or\n\notherwise, in the plea colloquy. Indeed, if the court had rejected\n\ndefendant's plea simply because it was motivated by his desire to\n\nremain in Massachusetts, that would conflict with the very purpose\n\nof Rule 20, i.e., \"to benefit defendants by sparing them the\n\nhardships    associated   with    appearance   and   trial    in   another\n\njurisdiction.\"   In re Arvedon, 523 F.2d 914, 916 (1st Cir. 1975).\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            Moreover, any error that occurred would not satisfy the\n\nthird prong of the plain-error standard, i.e., \"'a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for the error, [defendant] would not have\n\nentered the plea.'\"            Borrero-Acevedo, 533 F.3d at 16 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, 78 (2004)). Given\n\ndefendant's       unwavering    determination    to   plead    guilty,    despite\n\nseveral opportunities to change his mind, there is no indication\n\nthat, had he been aware of the possibility of seeking a transfer\n\nunder Rule 21, he would not have pled guilty.\n\n            Defendant      next     argues     that    the     district    court\n\nmiscalculated the loss amount by failing to credit him with the\n\nvalue of the property returned to the victim of the wire fraud\n\nbefore defendant was arrested.         If such a credit had been applied,\n\nthe loss amount would have fallen below $5,000 and no enhancement\n\nwould apply under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(1)(a) (providing for no increase\n\nin the base offense level where the amount of loss is $5,000 or\n\nless).\n\n            This argument was first made in defendant's pro se post-\n\njudgment motion to correct his sentence under Rule 35(a) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which the district court\n\ndenied without explanation. Whether viewed as an argument that the\n\ndistrict court erred or abused its discretion in denying the Rule\n\n35(a)    motion    or   plainly   erred   in   applying      the   guidelines   at\n\nsentencing, this argument fails.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f           Assuming--without     deciding--that   this    court     has\n\njurisdiction to review the district court's denial of relief under\n\nRule 35(a) despite the absence of a notice of appeal from that\n\nruling, but see United States v. Cartwright, 413 F.3d 1295, 1300\n\n(11th    Cir.   2005)   (under   those   circumstances,   finding    no\n\njurisdiction to review the district court's denial of a Rule 35(a)\n\nmotion), the district court did not err or abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying the motion.      The district court's authority under Rule\n\n35(a) \"to correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical,\n\ntechnical, or other clear error\"2 was \"intended to be very narrow\n\nand to extend only to those cases in which an obvious error or\n\nmistake has occurred in the sentence, that is, errors which would\n\nalmost certainly result in a remand of the case to the trial court\n\nfor further action.\"     Fed. R. Crim. P. 35, advisory comm. notes\n\n(1991 amends.); see also United States v. Aqua-Leisure Indus.,\n\nInc., 150 F.3d 95, 96 (1st Cir. 1998).     The guidelines application\n\nerror alleged here is not of that ilk; Rule 35(a) was \"not intended\n\nto afford the court the opportunity to reconsider the application\n\nor interpretation of the sentencing guidelines.\"     Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n35, advisory comm. notes (1991 amends.).\n\n           Nor did the district court plainly err at sentencing in\n\nfailing to credit defendant for the value of the returned property.\n\n\n\n     2\n      That authority formerly appeared in Rule 35(c).         Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 35, advisory comm. notes (2002 amends.).\n\n                                  -6-\n\fIn arguing that he was entitled to such a credit, defendant relies\n\non application note 3(E)(i) to U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, which allows the\n\namount of loss to be reduced only by the value of property returned\n\n\"before the offense was detected.\" Under that note, \"[t]he time of\n\ndetection of the offense is the earlier of (I) the time the offense\n\nwas discovered by a victim or government agency; or (II) the time\n\nthe defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the offense\n\nwas detected or about to be detected by a victim or government\n\nagency.\"    U.S.S.G.   §   2B1.1,   comment.   (n.3(E)(i)).     Based   on\n\ndefendant's admissions that he purchased equipment from the victim\n\nusing a wire transfer of funds, knowing that the account from which\n\nthe transfer was made was closed and contained no funds, and that\n\nhe returned a portion of the equipment shipped to him by the victim\n\nonly after the wire transfer was reversed by the bank and the\n\nvictim called him to complain, the district court could reasonably\n\ninfer that at the time that defendant returned the equipment, he\n\nknew or reasonably should have known that the offense was detected\n\nor about to be detected by the victim.         Therefore, the district\n\ncourt committed no error, plain or otherwise, in not crediting\n\ndefendant for the value of the returned equipment.\n\n           Finally,    defendant      challenges     the      substantive\n\nreasonableness of his sentence.      Particularly after Rita v. United\n\nStates, 127 S. Ct. 2456 (2007), \"[a] defendant who wishes to attack\n\n'an in-guideline-range sentence as excessive' must 'adduce fairly\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fpowerful mitigating reasons and persuade [this court] that the\n\ndistrict judge was unreasonable in balancing pros and cons despite\n\nthe    latitude    implicit    in   saying    that   a   sentence   must   be\n\n\"reasonable.\"'\"        United States v. Beatty, 538 F.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting United States v. Navedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d 54, 59\n\n(1st Cir. 2006)).        Here, the gist of defendant's argument is that\n\nthe district court should have given more weight to his medical\n\nproblems and the relatively minor nature of the instant offense and\n\nless    weight    to    his   apparently     uncontrollable   penchant     for\n\ncommitting similar offenses.        However, given the deference due to\n\nthe district court's balancing of the applicable factors, United\n\nStates v. Deppe, 509 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v.\n\nDixon, 449 F.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 2006), such an argument is\n\nusually unavailing, see, e.g., id., and this case is no exception.\n\n           Affirmed.       See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f",

Whether viewed as an argument that the\n\ndistrict court erred or abused its discretion in denying the Rule\n\n35(a)    motion    or   plainly   erred   in   applying      the   guidelines   at\n\nsentencing, this argument fails.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f           Assuming--without     deciding--that   this    court     has\n\njurisdiction to review the district court's denial of relief under\n\nRule 35(a) despite the absence of a notice of appeal from that\n\nruling, but see United States v. Cartwright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76975\"><a href=\"/opinion/76975/united-states-v-joel-cartwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1295</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1300\n\n(11th    Cir.   2005)   (under   those   circumstances,   finding    no\n\njurisdiction to review the district court's denial of a Rule 35(a)\n\nmotion), the district court did not err or abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying the motion.      The district court's authority under Rule\n\n35(a) \"to correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical,\n\ntechnical, or other clear error\"2 was \"intended to be very narrow\n\nand to extend only to those cases in which an obvious error or\n\nmistake has occurred in the sentence, that is, errors which would\n\nalmost certainly result in a remand of the case to the trial court\n\nfor further action.\"     Fed.

Aqua-Leisure Indus.,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198090\"><a href=\"/opinion/198090/united-states-v-aqua-leisure/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 (1st Cir. 1998).     The guidelines application\n\nerror alleged here is not of that ilk; Rule 35(a) was \"not intended\n\nto afford the court the opportunity to reconsider the application\n\nor interpretation of the sentencing guidelines.\"     Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n35, advisory comm. notes (1991 amends.).\n\n           Nor did the district court plainly err at sentencing in\n\nfailing to credit defendant for the value of the returned property.\n\n\n\n     2\n      That authority formerly appeared in Rule 35(c).         Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 35, advisory comm. notes (2002 amends.).\n\n                                  -6-\n\fIn arguing that he was entitled to such a credit, defendant relies\n\non application note 3(E)(i) to U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1, which allows the\n\namount of loss to be reduced only by the value of property returned\n\n\"before the offense was detected.\" Under that note, \"[t]he time of\n\ndetection of the offense is the earlier of (I) the time the offense\n\nwas discovered by a victim or government agency; or (II) the time\n\nthe defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the offense\n\nwas detected or about to be detected by a victim or government\n\nagency.\"    U.S.S.G.   §   2B1.1,   comment.   (n.3(E)(i)).     Based   on\n\ndefendant's admissions that he purchased equipment from the victim\n\nusing a wire transfer of funds, knowing that the account from which\n\nthe transfer was made was closed and contained no funds, and that\n\nhe returned a portion of the equipment shipped to him by the victim\n\nonly after the wire transfer was reversed by the bank and the\n\nvictim called him to complain, the district court could reasonably\n\ninfer that at the time that defendant returned the equipment, he\n\nknew or reasonably should have known that the offense was detected\n\nor about to be detected by the victim.         Therefore, the district\n\ncourt committed no error, plain or otherwise, in not crediting\n\ndefendant for the value of the returned equipment.\n\n           Finally,    defendant      challenges     the      substantive\n\nreasonableness of his sentence.

Here, the gist of defendant's argument is that\n\nthe district court should have given more weight to his medical\n\nproblems and the relatively minor nature of the instant offense and\n\nless    weight    to    his   apparently     uncontrollable   penchant     for\n\ncommitting similar offenses.
