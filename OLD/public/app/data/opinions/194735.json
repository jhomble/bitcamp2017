Plaintiff-appellant  Carmen\n          SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                                \n\nFragoso de  Conway (Fragoso),  a citizen  of New  Jersey, appeals\n\nfrom  an order of the district court granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor  of certain defendants,  including an  insurer, Corporacion\n\nInsular  de  Seguros (CIS),  which  became  insolvent during  the\n\npendency of  the appeal.   We now conclude  (1) that there  is no\n\ncompelling reason, based on either Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 64 (1938), or Burford  v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S.  315 (1943),\n                                          \n\nfor us to  abstain in favor  of the liquidator's forum,  (2) that\n\nthe appeal  may proceed  in the ordinary  course, notwithstanding\n\nCIS's financial plight, and (3) that appellant's arguments on the\n\nmerits  are unavailing.    Consequently, we  affirm the  judgment\n\nbelow.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Dr. Maria  A. Lopez  first treated  appellant's mother,\n\nMilagros Rodriguez de Fragoso,  as an outpatient.   She diagnosed\n\nMrs. Rodriguez's condition as transient  cerebrovascular ischemic\n\nactivity  and  referred her  to  Dr.  Mojica for  a  neurological\n\nconsultation.   On October 13, 1984, Mrs.  Rodriguez was admitted\n\nto Doctor's Hospital complaining  of numbness in her limbs.   Dr.\n\nLopez performed a cardiology evaluation the next day.  On October\n\n18, Mrs. Rodriguez  complained of  tightness in her  chest.   Dr.\n\nLopez sharply  reduced the  prescribed medication and  ordered an\n\nelectrocardiogram.   Later that  evening, Mrs. Rodriguez  died of\n\nheart failure.\n\n          Plaintiff's   cousin,   Nilda  Fragoso   de  Rodriguez,\n\n                                3\n\nsuspected medical malpractice.  In December 1984, she relayed her\n\nsuspicions  to  appellant.     On  January  16,  1985,  appellant\n\ncontacted   Attorney  Hector   Alvarado-Tizol   to  explore   the\n\npossibility of a suit.  That same day, appellant hand-delivered a\n\nletter  to  Doctor's  Hospital  requesting  her  mother's medical\n\nrecords.1    Appellant  then  returned  to  New  Jersey,  leaving\n\nmatters in her attorney's hands.\n\n          On  April  5, 1989    over  four  full years  after her\n\nmother's death      appellant invoked diversity  jurisdiction, 28\n\nU.S.C.    1332  (1988), and  sued Lopez,  CIS, and  several other\n\nhealth-care  providers in Puerto  Rico's federal  district court.\n\n(CIS was joined as  a defendant pursuant to Puerto  Rico's direct\n\naction  statute,   P.R.  Laws  Ann.  tit.  26,     2003  (1990).)\n\nFollowing  a lengthy  period  devoted to  discovery and  pretrial\n\nskirmishing,  and   marked  by  settlement  of   the  plaintiff's\n\ndifferences  with other  named defendants,  Lopez and  CIS sought\n\nsummary judgment.  On July 13, 1992, the district court found the\n\nsuit  to  be   barred  by  Puerto  Rico's   one-year  statute  of\n\nlimitations   governing  negligence   actions  and   granted  the\n\ndefendants' motion.  The court thereafter denied Fragoso's motion\n\nfor reconsideration.  This appeal ensued.2\n\nII.  THE REQUEST TO DISMISS THE APPEAL OR STAY PROCEEDINGS\n\n                    \n\n     1In her  deposition, Fragoso speculated that  the letter may\nhave been delivered during  the spring of 1985.  She now concedes\nthat it was delivered on January 16, 1985.\n\n     2When  summary judgment was entered, Lopez  and CIS were the\nsole  remaining  defendants.    They  are,  therefore,  the  sole\nappellees. \n\n                                4\n\n          On  December 23,  1992, shortly  after this  appeal had\n\nbeen  assigned for  hearing,  appellees filed  a motion  relating\n\nthat,   on  December   21,  1992,   the  Puerto   Rico  Insurance\n\nCommissioner   (the  Commissioner)   had   petitioned   for   the\n\nliquidation  of CIS; that  a superior  court judge,  discerning a\n\n$28,000,000 capital insufficiency,  appointed the Commissioner as\n\nliquidator of  CIS under P.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 26,    4004 (1976);\n\nand  that  the judge  had issued  an  order remitting  all claims\n\nagainst  CIS   to  the  claims  process   demarcated  within  the\n\nliquidation  proceedings.3   Appellees  requested that  the claim\n\nunderlying the  instant appeal  be so  forwarded (and  the appeal\n\ndismissed), or, alternatively, that proceedings herein be  stayed\n\npendente lite pursuant  to a provision of Puerto Rico's Insurance\n             \n\nCode.4  We granted an  interim stay of  proceedings and requested\n\n                    \n\n     3The  original order was soon amended and we refer herein to\nthe  amended version as the  Liquidation Order.   Paragraph 25 of\nthe  Liquidation Order provides that \"any claims against [CIS] or\nits insurers under  an insurance  policy or any[]  other kind  of\nclaim, be remitted to the Liquidator . . . . \"\n\n     4The statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n          Judicial proceedings to which  [an] insolvent\n          insurer is an  interested party  or in  which\n          [it] is bound to represent a party in a court\n          of  competent  jurisdiction  in  Puerto  Rico\n          shall  be temporarily  suspended for  six (6)\n          months or that period  in addition to the six\n          (6)   months   granted   by   a   court  with\n          jurisdiction,  from  the date  the insolvency\n          was determined to  permit the [liquidator] an\n          adequate  defense  of   all  causes   pending\n          action.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26,   3818 (Supp. 1989).\n\n                                5\n\nsupplemental briefing from the parties and the Commissioner.  The\n\nbriefing period having passed, we now consider appellees' and the\n\nCommissioner's requests that we remit the underlying claim to the\n\nliquidator's  claims process  or, at  least, stay  proceedings in\n\nthis case pending the expiration  of the full cooling-off  period\n\nstipulated in the Insurance Code.\n\n                     A.  The Erie Doctrine.  \n                     A.  The Erie Doctrine.\n                                           \n\n          We start  with bedrock:   a state  court cannot  enjoin\n\nfederal  proceedings.  See General Atomic Co. v. Felter, 434 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n12,  17  (1977); Donovan  v. Dallas,  377  U.S. 408,  413 (1964).\n                                   \n\nThus, the prohibitions contained in  the Liquidation Order do not\n\nbind this court.\n\n          The truism, however,  does not end the matter.  Relying\n\non the  Rules of Decision Act,  see 28 U.S.C.    1652 (1988), and\n                                   \n\nthe familiar  Erie doctrine,  304 U.S.  at  78, the  Commissioner\n                  \n\nposits  that, in  the  exercise of  diversity jurisdiction,  this\n\ncourt must  apply several  provisions of Puerto  Rico's Insurance\n\nCode collectively  requiring dismissal  of the claim  against CIS\n\nand  a six-month stay of the claim  against Lopez.  See P.R. Laws\n                                                       \n\nAnn. tit. 26,    3818, 3819, 4021, 4032.  We disagree.\n\n          A federal  court sitting  in diversity is  not required\n\nautomatically  to  follow  all  particulars of  a  state  court's\n\nprocess  for dispute resolution.   Rather,  Erie and  its progeny\n                                                \n\nidentify  certain principles that must be used to cull wheat from\n\nchaff.    The  \"twin  aims\"  animating   the  Erie  doctrine  are\n                                                  \n\n\"discouragement  of forum-shopping  and avoidance  of inequitable\n\n                                6\n\nadministration of the laws.\"  Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460,  468\n                                             \n\n(1965).    These goals  are intertwined  with  the policy  that a\n\nfederal forum \"should conform as near  as may be   in the absence\n\nof other considerations    to state rules even of  form and mode\"\n\nwhen those rules \"may  bear substantially\" on the outcome  of the\n\nlitigation.  Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Coop., Inc., 356 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n525, 536 (1958); see Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 109\n                                               \n\n(1945);  Feinstein v. Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., 643 F.2d 880, 884\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir.  1981).  After  giving respectful consideration  to the\n\nCommissioner's views, we believe that processing Fragoso's appeal\n\nwithout regard to Puerto Rico's  legal framework for dealing with\n\ninsolvent insurers will not offend the Erie rule.\n                                           \n\n          For one  thing, it is inconceivable  that a defendant's\n\ndifferential ability, depending upon  whether the suit is brought\n\nin  a federal or in a commonwealth court, to invoke Puerto Rico's\n\nprocedural law anent insolvent insurers after  trial and entry of\n\njudgment will influence  a litigant's  choice of forum.   When  a\n\nplaintiff selects a forum at  the commencement of litigation, she\n\nis unlikely  to weigh the possibility that  a defendant's insurer\n\nmight  become  insolvent   years  later,  thus   influencing  the\n\nprocedural  status of pending appeals.   We think,  too, that the\n\nuncertainty as to how  a Puerto Rico appellate court  might apply\n\nthe  laws  in  question would  stymie  attempted  forum-shopping.\n\nAlthough  the  Commissioner maintains  that a  commonwealth court\n\nwould dismiss the appeal against CIS, the forecasted result is by\n\nno means certain.   The Insurance Code  directs  a six-month stay\n\n                                7\n\nof  all proceedings against the insolvent insurer.  See P.R. Laws\n                                                       \n\nAnn.  tit.  26,      3818,  quoted  supra  note  4.    While  the\n                                         \n\nCommissioner  assumes that  P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit.  26,    4021(1)\n\nmandates dismissal  of the  appeal,5 he  neither suggests how  to\n\nreconcile  this provision with  section 3818 nor  explains how an\n\nappellate   proceeding  filed  against  the  insurer  before  the\n\nissuance of a liquidation order comes within the contemplation of\n\nsection 4021.  The first Erie consideration, then, does not favor\n                             \n\napplication  of Puerto  Rico's Insurance  Code provisions  to the\n\ninstant appeal.\n\n          For    another   thing,   declining    to   apply   the\n\nCommonwealth's procedural laws here will not advantage Fragoso as\n\ncompared  with similarly  situated, non-diverse plaintiffs.   Cf.\n                                                                 \n\nErie, 304 U.S. at 74-75.   A principal function of the  Insurance\n    \n\nCode provisions is to allow adequate time for defense preparation\n\nand  minimize   expense.     Here,  additional  time   is  wholly\n\nunnecessary; the case was fully briefed prior to the entry of the\n\nLiquidation  Order  and  the  merits  are   straightforward,  not\n\nrequiring  oral argument.  See  Fed. R. App.  P. 34(a) (providing\n                              \n\nfor  eschewal  of  oral  argument  where  \"the  facts  and  legal\n\narguments  are adequately presented in the  briefs and record and\n\nthe  decisional process would not  be significantly aided by oral\n\nargument\");  1st  Cir. Loc.  R.  34.1(a)(2)(iii)  (same).   Thus,\n\n                    \n\n     5The language  upon which the Commissioner  relies states in\npertinent part that \"no action at law or  equity shall be brought\nagainst  the insurer  or  liquidator, whether  in Puerto  Rico or\nelsewhere, nor shall  any such existing actions be  maintained or\nfurther presented after issuance [of a liquidation order].\" \n\n                                8\n\nrefusal to remit the action against CIS to the liquidator's forum\n\nor to stay the  action against Lopez works  no inequity from  the\n\nstandpoint of either preparation or defense costs.\n\n          What  is  more,    Puerto  Rico's  insolvent  insurers'\n\nliquidation  provisions  do  not  bear in  the  slightest  on the\n\nsubstantive  outcome  of  the  appeal.    These  laws  provide  a\n\nprocedure  through  which  claims  against  the  insurer  can  be\n\nresolved and  its  assets equitably  distributed.   They  do  not\n\nabsolve  the insurer of any  substantive liability.   There is no\n\nbasis  for  concluding  that  this  court  will  reach  a  result\n\nregarding the underlying  merits of Fragoso's appeal  that is any\n\ndifferent from the result  that a Puerto Rico court  would reach,\n\nhad  it stayed the action,  or that the  liquidator's forum would\n\nreach, had the action been forwarded there.\n\n          Thus, we  reject the  Commissioner's argument  that the\n\nErie  doctrine compels us to  dismiss the appeal  against CIS and\n    \n\nstay the proceeding against Lopez.\n\n               B.  Relevancy of Burford Abstention.\n                                                   \n\n          In  the alternative,  the  Commissioner urges  that  we\n\nabstain from hearing the instant appeal under the rule of Burford\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Thus, the  Puerto  Rico  Insurance  Code\nfashions   a  format   for  regulating   insurers'  insolvencies,\nrehabilitations, and liquidations, centralizing  proceedings into\na  single court analogous  to a federal  bankruptcy court wherein\nthe  Commissioner, as  an  agent of  the  court, functions  as  a\n\n                                11\n\nwhich deference under Burford  may be paid.  While  the Insurance\n                             \n\nCode regulates insolvent insurers  doing business in Puerto Rico,\n              \n\nit is not at all clear  that it sets up the functional equivalent\n\nof an administrative agency.\n\n          In the  third place, Burford  abstention is  implicated\n                                      \n\nwhen  the federal  courts  are  asked  to  interfere  with  state\n\nprocesses  by  reviewing  the  proceedings  or  orders  of  state\n                        \n\nadministrative  agencies, ergo,  the requirement  of \"timely  and\n\nadequate  state-court review.\"    NOPSI, 491  U.S.  at 361.

Burford, as  explicated by the  NOPSI Court, involves\n                                                 \nthe protection  of \"complex  state administrative  processes from\nundue federal interference, [but]  it does not require abstention\nwhenever there exists such a process, or even in all cases  where\nthere  is a potential for  conflict with state  regulatory law or\npolicy.\"  NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 362 (citation and internal quotation\n               \nmarks  omitted); see also Chemerinsky, supra, at 112.  Indeed, we\n                                            \nread  the Third  Circuit's post-NOPSI  caselaw as  signalling the\n                                     \ndemise of  Lac D'Amiante.  See University  of Md. v. Peat Marwick\n                                                                 \nMain &amp; Co., 923 F.2d 265, 272  (3d Cir. 1991); see also Melahn v.\n                                                              \nPennock  Ins.,  Inc.,   965  F.2d  1497,  1505  (8th  Cir.  1992)\n                    \n\n                                15\n\nthe  instant case for a number of  reasons.  First, in nearly all\n\nof those cases, insolvency intervened  before the trial court had\n\nentered  final judgment.  Ordinarily, the  more embryonic a case,\n\nthe more significant an interference with the state framework for\n\nhandling insurance  liquidation if the federal  tribunal does not\n\nyield.  A  case such as Fragoso's, where a  trial is complete and\n\nsolely legal  questions suitable for federal appellate resolution\n\nare pending on appeal,  is a very weak candidate  for abstention.\n\nAs we have remarked before,  abstention serves \"the interests not\n\nonly  of  federalism, but  of  comity  and judicial  efficiency.\"\n\nMedical Malpractice  Joint  Underwriting Ass'n  v. Pfeiffer,  832\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 240, 244 (1st Cir. 1987).  Once a federal court has rendered\n\na final  judgment, it  is questionable  whether abstention is  an\n\nefficient or practical move.   After all, the liquidator's  forum\n\nhas  no mechanism for reviewing  a federal court  decision.  What\n\nwould become  of the original judgment  is a puzzle.   In Bilden,\n                                                                \n\nwhere  the  district  court  rendered  its  judgment  before  the\n\ninsurance  company entered  liquidation proceedings,  see Bilden,\n                                                                \n\n921 F.2d at 824, the Eighth  Circuit held that an appeals court's\n\ndecision   on   the  merits   would   not   interfere  with   the\n\nrehabilitator's  control of  the  insurance company  or with  the\n\nproper  operation of the state's  regulatory format.   See id. at\n                                                              \n\n826.  It is difficult to fault so level-headed an approach.\n\n          Second,  the  concerns  animating abstention  in  Media\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n(observing \"that the Third Circuit has cast doubt on the vitality\nof [Lac D'Amiante] as a result of the Supreme Court's more recent\n                 \nholding in NOPSI\") (citing Peat Marwick Main).   \n                                            \n\n                                16\n\nElements, the one case cited supra where the Burford issue became\n                                                    \n\nrelevant only on appeal and  the court nevertheless abstained, do\n\nnot apply here.  The appeal in Media Elements involved a coverage\n                                             \n\nissue and,  therefore, the  court reasoned that  abstention would\n\nlessen the  risk of  inconsistent coverage interpretations.   See\n                                                                 \n\nMedia Elements,  946 F.2d  at 157.    Fragoso's appeal,  however,\n              \n\nrequires  that we decide a question of law unrelated to coverage.\n\nThe case is idiocratic and fact-specific.  Passing on this appeal\n\ncould  not possibly  impair uniformity  in the  interpretation of\n\nCIS's  insurance  policies,  nor  could  doing  so  obstruct  the\n\nadjudication  of claims  against CIS  in the  liquidator's forum.\n\nThis is a singularly  important difference.  See Grimes  v. Crown\n                                                                 \n\nLife  Ins. Co., 857 F.2d 699, 704  (10th Cir. 1988) (stating that\n              \n\nabstention  is less desirable where  a suit does  not require the\n\ncourt to  determine issues  which are  directly  relevant to  the\n\nliquidation proceeding  or to state policies),  cert. denied, 489\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 1096 (1989).  In fact, it seems more  likely that processing\n\nthe appeal,  with the result  that the district  court's judgment\n\nwill  be affirmed or vacated, would help the Commissioner, for it\n\nis totally unclear  how the commonwealth forum  would resolve the\n\nappellate matter, or that it could.\n\n          The Media Elements panel  also observed that compliance\n                            \n\nwith Puerto  Rico's  process would  reduce  the funds  which  the\n\ninsurer would have to spend on  litigation.  See 946 F.2d at 157.\n                                                \n\nResolving this appeal in the ordinary  course, however, would not\n\ncost CIS money.  The briefs are already filed, and, as previously\n\n                                17\n\npointed out, see  supra p.7, there is no  need for oral argument.\n                       \n\nTherefore,  the concerns  that may  have warranted  abstention in\n\nMedia  Elements  are  not  present  here.    We  are,  therefore,\n               \n\ncomfortable in limiting Media Elements to its own facts.10\n                                      \n\n          We need go no further.  NOPSI makes clear that  Burford\n                                                                 \n\nabstention   requires  more   than  a   desire  to   avoid  every\n\ninconvenience to, or disruption of, a state's regulatory systems.\n\nOtherwise,  abstention would be  proper \"in any  instance where a\n\nmatter  was   within  an  administrative   body's  jurisdiction.\"\n\nChemerinsky,  supra,  at 112.    That  cannot be  the  rule.   It\n                   \n\nfollows, then,  that the mere  existence of state  procedures, or\n\neven  the existence  of  a complex  state  apparatus designed  to\n\nhandle a specific class of problems, does not necessarily justify\n\nabstention.  See  Melahn v.  Pennock Ins., Inc.,  965 F.2d  1497,\n                                               \n\n1505 (8th Cir.  1992).   In the final  analysis, abstention  here\n\nwould   be  inconsistent   with  the   policies  underlying   the\n\nconstitutional grant of diversity jurisdiction and would render a\n\nsubstantial  injustice  to  those  litigants  seeking   to  avail\n\nthemselves  of their  statutory right  to a  federal forum.   See\n                                                                 \n\nAllegheny County, 360 U.S. at  188 (observing that abstention \"is\n                \n\nan extraordinary and narrow  exception to the duty of  a District\n\nCourt  to adjudicate  a controversy  properly before  it\").   We,\n\n                    \n\n     10We note in passing that, while Media Elements  was decided\n                                                    \nafter NOPSI,  the order  for abstention neither  cited NOPSI  nor\n                                                            \nacknowledged its suzerainty.\n\n                                18\n\ntherefore, decline the invitation to abstain.11   \n\nIII.  THE ENTRY OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n          The merits of the  appeal need not detain us.   Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers\n\nto  interrogatories, and  admissions on  file, together  with the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that  the moving party is entitled  to judgment\n\nas a  matter  of law.\"    Fed. R.  Civ.  P.  56(c).   The  rule's\n\nmechanics  are well  known.   Once  the  movant demonstrates  \"an\n\nabsence  of  evidence to  support  the  nonmoving party's  case,\"\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986), the nonmovant\n                        \n\nmust establish the  existence of  at least one  genuine issue  of\n\nmaterial fact.   See Anderson  v. Liberty Lobby,  Inc., 477  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n242, 248 (1986).  Where,  as here, a motion for summary  judgment\n\nhas  been granted, appellate review  is plenary.   Hence, we must\n\nevaluate the entire record in the ambiance most flattering to the\n\nsummary judgment loser,  indulging all  reasonable inferences  in\n\nher favor, in order to determine the propriety of the order.  See\n                                                                 \n\nMesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950  F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991),\n                            \n\ncert. denied, 112 S.  Ct. 2965 (1992); Griggs-Ryan v.  Smith, 904\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990); Mack v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co.,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     11Neither the Commissioner nor the appellees have  contended\nthat  any idiosyncracy  in Puerto  Rico's direct  action statute,\nP.R.  Laws  Ann. tit.  26,    2003,  compels a  different result.\nBecause of this fact,  and because of the utter lack of prejudice\nto the  insurer in the posture of this  case, we do not reach the\nquestion  of  whether a  liquidator of  an insolvent  Puerto Rico\ninsurance  company may have greater rights to insist upon a local\nforum when the company  is a party to the  underlying suit solely\nby virtue of the direct action statute.\n\n                                19\n\n871 F.2d 179, 181 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          In this diversity action, the substantive law of Puerto\n\nRico  controls.   See  Erie, 304  U.S.  at 78.    The statute  of\n                           \n\nlimitations  governing negligence actions is \"one year . . . from\n\nthe time the aggrieved person has knowledge of the injury.\"  P.R.\n\nLaws Ann.  tit. 31,    5298 (1990).   \"Knowledge of  the injury,\"\n\nunder Puerto  Rico law, is a term of art.   It requires a showing\n\nof both  \"notice of  the injury\"  and \"notice  of the  person who\n\ncaused  it.\"   Colon Prieto v.  Geigel, 115  D.P.R. 232,  247, 15\n                                      \n\nOfficial  Translations  313,   330  (1985)  (citation   omitted).\n\nLimitations defenses may appropriately be resolved at the summary\n\njudgment stage  if reasonable minds  could not  differ about  the\n\nlegal effect of the properly documented facts of record, taken in\n\nthe light most  favorable to  the nonmovant.   See Kali  Seafood,\n                                                                 \n\nInc. v. Howe Corp., 887 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1989); Mack, 871 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 181. \n\n          In this case,  Fragoso admittedly knew of the  injury  \n\nher  mother's demise   and she was informed shortly thereafter of\n\nthe  possible link  between the  injury and  medical malpractice.\n\nShe  treated this  information  as credible  and  acted upon  it,\n\npromptly retaining an attorney  to explore that very nexus.   The\n\nquestion in this  case, then, is  whether appellant's failure  to\n\nacquire notice of  the person  or persons who  caused the  injury\n\ntolled the limitations period.\n\n          We, like other courts, recognize that  it is unfair, by\n\nand large, to  bar a tort action by the mere passage of time if a\n\n                                20\n\nplaintiff,  exercising  due   diligence,  cannot  ascertain   the\n\ntortfeasor's  identity.   Because self-induced  ignorance of  the\n\ntortfeasor's identity will not interrupt the limitations period, \n\n\"[t]he  key   inquiry  under   this  prong  of   the  `knowledge'\n\nrequirement is  whether  plaintiff knew  or `with  the degree  of\n\ndiligence required by law' would have known whom to sue.\"  Kaiser\n                                                                 \n\nv.

This means that  an inquiring court\n\nmust  ascertain   whether  ignorance  of  a   fact  reflects  the\n\nplaintiff's  negligence,  because, if  it  does,  the limitations\n\nclock will continue to tick.  See Santiago Hodge v. Parke Davis &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 833 F.2d  6, 8 (1st Cir. 1987); Colon  Prieto, 115 D.P.R. at\n                                                  \n\n244,   15  Official  Translations  at   327-28.    Just  as  \"the\n\nlimitations period will be suspended only upon a clear showing of\n\ndiligent efforts to discover  the cause of the injury  or death,\"\n\nAldahonda-Rivera v. Parke  Davis &amp;  Co., 882 F.2d  590, 594  (1st\n                                       \n\nCir.  1989),  so the  law requires  a  clear showing  of diligent\n\nefforts  to discover  the  identity of  likely defendants  before\n\nsuspending the prescriptive period.\n\n          Under Puerto Rico law, if a plaintiff sues in tort more\n\nthan a year after the injury  took place, she bears the devoir of\n\npersuasion with respect  to proving that she lacked the knowledge\n\nwhich would  have  enabled her  to  sue within  the  prescriptive\n\nperiod.  See Kaiser, 872 F.2d at 516; Santiago Hodge, 833 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n7.   Here, appellant,  who sued long  after the  year had passed,\n\nwholly failed to carry her corollary burden.  The record reflects\n\n                                21\n\nan extraordinary delay   well over four years   between the  time\n\nappellant first  had reason to believe  that someone's negligence\n\nhad caused her mother's death and the time  she actually took aim\n\nat a particular cadre of defendants.  \n\n          Moreover,  the  delay  was  never  credibly  explained.\n\nAlthough  appellant  argued   before  the  district   court  that\n\ndifficulties in  procuring the hospital record  caused the delay,\n\nher  argument  was based  on  freestanding  allegations and  was,\n\ntherefore, appropriately rejected.  We have made it crystal clear\n\nthat, in opposing summary judgment, a litigant \"may not rest upon\n\nmere  allegations in,  say, an  unverified complaint  or lawyer's\n\nbrief, but  must produce evidence  which would  be admissible  at\n\ntrial  to make out the requisite issue  of material fact.\"  Kelly\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Because   the  record  evinced  no  credible  basis  for\n\nconcluding  anything  other  than  that  the  prescriptive period\n\nexpired  due  to       some  unexplained  cause  (not   excluding\n\nappellant's inattentiveness), summary judgment  was appropriately\n\nentered.\n\nIV.  THE REFUSAL TO RETRACT\n\n           In a last-ditch effort  to salvage her case, appellant\n\nassigns  error  to the  lower court's  denial  of her  motion for\n\nreconsideration.      In   this   instance,   the   motion    for\n\nreconsideration added one  new ingredient  to the mix:   a  sworn\n\nstatement from  appellant's cousin,  Nilda Fragoso de  Rodriguez.\n\nThe  affidavit relates  that Nilda  accompanied appellant  to the\n\nlawyer's office in  December, 1984;  that the  lawyer wanted  the\n\ndecedent's medical records so that he could have them scrutinized\n\nby  an expert;  that Nilda  requested the  records from  Doctor's\n\nHospital in January of 1985; that  she returned twice more to the\n\nhospital (on  unspecified dates)  before receiving the  record on\n\nher third trip  (the date of which is also unspecified); that she\n\ntook the record  to the attorney;  that, later,  on a date  again\n\nunspecified,  she returned to  the hospital  to get  \"a certified\n\ncopy of the full record\"; that, after a few telephone inquires on\n\nunspecified dates, she received the complete record; and that she\n\ndelivered it  to  the lawyer  the  same day  (date  unspecified).\n\n                                23\n\nBereft,  as it is, of  even approximate dates,  this affidavit is\n\nmanifestly insufficient to  turn the  tide.  It  shows, at  most,\n\ndesultory   efforts  inadequate   to  demonstrate   diligence  in\n\nobtaining the records;  and, moreover, it wholly fails to suggest\n\nany good reason why appellant  and her attorney sat  complacently\n\nby for so long a period of time.\n\n          Where, as here, a motion for  summary judgment has been\n\ngranted,  \"the  district  court  has  substantial  discretion  in\n\ndeciding  whether to reopen the proceedings in order to allow the\n\nunsuccessful  party  to introduce  new  material or  argue  a new\n\ntheory.\"  Mackin v.

Consequently, we  affirm the  judgment\n\nbelow.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Dr. Maria  A. Lopez  first treated  appellant's mother,\n\nMilagros Rodriguez de Fragoso,  as an outpatient.   She diagnosed\n\nMrs. Rodriguez's condition as transient  cerebrovascular ischemic\n\nactivity  and  referred her  to  Dr.  Mojica for  a  neurological\n\nconsultation.   On October 13, 1984, Mrs.  Rodriguez was admitted\n\nto Doctor's Hospital complaining  of numbness in her limbs.   Dr.\n\nLopez performed a cardiology evaluation the next day.  On October\n\n18, Mrs. Rodriguez  complained of  tightness in her  chest.   Dr.\n\nLopez sharply  reduced the  prescribed medication and  ordered an\n\nelectrocardiogram.   Later that  evening, Mrs. Rodriguez  died of\n\nheart failure.\n\n          Plaintiff's   cousin,   Nilda  Fragoso   de  Rodriguez,\n\n                                3\n\nsuspected medical malpractice.  In December 1984, she relayed her\n\nsuspicions  to  appellant.     On  January  16,  1985,  appellant\n\ncontacted   Attorney  Hector   Alvarado-Tizol   to  explore   the\n\npossibility of a suit.  That same day, appellant hand-delivered a\n\nletter  to  Doctor's  Hospital  requesting  her  mother's medical\n\nrecords.1    Appellant  then  returned  to  New  Jersey,  leaving\n\nmatters in her attorney's hands.\n\n          On  April  5, 1989    over  four  full years  after her\n\nmother's death      appellant invoked diversity  jurisdiction, 28\n\nU.S.C.    1332  (1988), and  sued Lopez,  CIS, and  several other\n\nhealth-care  providers in Puerto  Rico's federal  district court.\n\n(CIS was joined as  a defendant pursuant to Puerto  Rico's direct\n\naction  statute,   P.R.  Laws  Ann.  tit.  26,     2003  (1990).)\n\nFollowing  a lengthy  period  devoted to  discovery and  pretrial\n\nskirmishing,  and   marked  by  settlement  of   the  plaintiff's\n\ndifferences  with other  named defendants,  Lopez and  CIS sought\n\nsummary judgment.  On July 13, 1992, the district court found the\n\nsuit  to  be   barred  by  Puerto  Rico's   one-year  statute  of\n\nlimitations   governing  negligence   actions  and   granted  the\n\ndefendants' motion.  The court thereafter denied Fragoso's motion\n\nfor reconsideration.  This appeal ensued.2\n\nII.  THE REQUEST TO DISMISS THE APPEAL OR STAY PROCEEDINGS\n\n                    \n\n     1In her  deposition, Fragoso speculated that  the letter may\nhave been delivered during  the spring of 1985.  She now concedes\nthat it was delivered on January 16, 1985.\n\n     2When  summary judgment was entered, Lopez  and CIS were the\nsole  remaining  defendants.    They  are,  therefore,  the  sole\nappellees. \n\n                                4\n\n          On  December 23,  1992, shortly  after this  appeal had\n\nbeen  assigned for  hearing,  appellees filed  a motion  relating\n\nthat,   on  December   21,  1992,   the  Puerto   Rico  Insurance\n\nCommissioner   (the  Commissioner)   had   petitioned   for   the\n\nliquidation  of CIS; that  a superior  court judge,  discerning a\n\n$28,000,000 capital insufficiency,  appointed the Commissioner as\n\nliquidator of  CIS under P.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 26,    4004 (1976);\n\nand  that  the judge  had issued  an  order remitting  all claims\n\nagainst  CIS   to  the  claims  process   demarcated  within  the\n\nliquidation  proceedings.3   Appellees  requested that  the claim\n\nunderlying the  instant appeal  be so  forwarded (and  the appeal\n\ndismissed), or, alternatively, that proceedings herein be  stayed\n\npendente lite pursuant  to a provision of Puerto Rico's Insurance\n             \n\nCode.4  We granted an  interim stay of  proceedings and requested\n\n                    \n\n     3The  original order was soon amended and we refer herein to\nthe  amended version as the  Liquidation Order.   Paragraph 25 of\nthe  Liquidation Order provides that \"any claims against [CIS] or\nits insurers under  an insurance  policy or any[]  other kind  of\nclaim, be remitted to the Liquidator . . . . \"\n\n     4The statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n          Judicial proceedings to which  [an] insolvent\n          insurer is an  interested party  or in  which\n          [it] is bound to represent a party in a court\n          of  competent  jurisdiction  in  Puerto  Rico\n          shall  be temporarily  suspended for  six (6)\n          months or that period  in addition to the six\n          (6)   months   granted   by   a   court  with\n          jurisdiction,  from  the date  the insolvency\n          was determined to  permit the [liquidator] an\n          adequate  defense  of   all  causes   pending\n          action.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26,   3818 (Supp. 1989).\n\n                                5\n\nsupplemental briefing from the parties and the Commissioner.  The\n\nbriefing period having passed, we now consider appellees' and the\n\nCommissioner's requests that we remit the underlying claim to the\n\nliquidator's  claims process  or, at  least, stay  proceedings in\n\nthis case pending the expiration  of the full cooling-off  period\n\nstipulated in the Insurance Code.\n\n                     A.

Relying\n\non the  Rules of Decision Act,  see 28 U.S.C.    1652 (1988), and\n                                   \n\nthe familiar  Erie doctrine,  304 U.S.  at  78, the  Commissioner\n                  \n\nposits  that, in  the  exercise of  diversity jurisdiction,  this\n\ncourt must  apply several  provisions of Puerto  Rico's Insurance\n\nCode collectively  requiring dismissal  of the claim  against CIS\n\nand  a six-month stay of the claim  against Lopez.  See P.R. Laws\n                                                       \n\nAnn. tit. 26,    3818, 3819, 4021, 4032.  We disagree.\n\n          A federal  court sitting  in diversity is  not required\n\nautomatically  to  follow  all  particulars of  a  state  court's\n\nprocess  for dispute resolution.   Rather,  Erie and  its progeny\n                                                \n\nidentify  certain principles that must be used to cull wheat from\n\nchaff.    The  \"twin  aims\"  animating   the  Erie  doctrine  are\n                                                  \n\n\"discouragement  of forum-shopping  and avoidance  of inequitable\n\n                                6\n\nadministration of the laws.\"  Hanna v.

After  giving respectful consideration  to the\n\nCommissioner's views, we believe that processing Fragoso's appeal\n\nwithout regard to Puerto Rico's  legal framework for dealing with\n\ninsolvent insurers will not offend the Erie rule.\n                                           \n\n          For one  thing, it is inconceivable  that a defendant's\n\ndifferential ability, depending upon  whether the suit is brought\n\nin  a federal or in a commonwealth court, to invoke Puerto Rico's\n\nprocedural law anent insolvent insurers after  trial and entry of\n\njudgment will influence  a litigant's  choice of forum.   When  a\n\nplaintiff selects a forum at  the commencement of litigation, she\n\nis unlikely  to weigh the possibility that  a defendant's insurer\n\nmight  become  insolvent   years  later,  thus   influencing  the\n\nprocedural  status of pending appeals.   We think,  too, that the\n\nuncertainty as to how  a Puerto Rico appellate court  might apply\n\nthe  laws  in  question would  stymie  attempted  forum-shopping.\n\nAlthough  the  Commissioner maintains  that a  commonwealth court\n\nwould dismiss the appeal against CIS, the forecasted result is by\n\nno means certain.   The Insurance Code  directs  a six-month stay\n\n                                7\n\nof  all proceedings against the insolvent insurer.  See P.R. Laws\n                                                       \n\nAnn.  tit.  26,      3818,  quoted  supra  note  4.    While  the\n                                         \n\nCommissioner  assumes that  P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit.  26,    4021(1)\n\nmandates dismissal  of the  appeal,5 he  neither suggests how  to\n\nreconcile  this provision with  section 3818 nor  explains how an\n\nappellate   proceeding  filed  against  the  insurer  before  the\n\nissuance of a liquidation order comes within the contemplation of\n\nsection 4021.  The first Erie consideration, then, does not favor\n                             \n\napplication  of Puerto  Rico's Insurance  Code provisions  to the\n\ninstant appeal.\n\n          For    another   thing,   declining    to   apply   the\n\nCommonwealth's procedural laws here will not advantage Fragoso as\n\ncompared  with similarly  situated, non-diverse plaintiffs.   Cf.\n                                                                 \n\nErie, 304 U.S. at 74-75.   A principal function of the  Insurance\n    \n\nCode provisions is to allow adequate time for defense preparation\n\nand  minimize   expense.     Here,  additional  time   is  wholly\n\nunnecessary; the case was fully briefed prior to the entry of the\n\nLiquidation  Order  and  the  merits  are   straightforward,  not\n\nrequiring  oral argument.  See  Fed. R. App.  P. 34(a) (providing\n                              \n\nfor  eschewal  of  oral  argument  where  \"the  facts  and  legal\n\narguments  are adequately presented in the  briefs and record and\n\nthe  decisional process would not  be significantly aided by oral\n\nargument\");  1st  Cir. Loc.  R.  34.1(a)(2)(iii)  (same).   Thus,\n\n                    \n\n     5The language  upon which the Commissioner  relies states in\npertinent part that \"no action at law or  equity shall be brought\nagainst  the insurer  or  liquidator, whether  in Puerto  Rico or\nelsewhere, nor shall  any such existing actions be  maintained or\nfurther presented after issuance [of a liquidation order].\" \n\n                                8\n\nrefusal to remit the action against CIS to the liquidator's forum\n\nor to stay the  action against Lopez works  no inequity from  the\n\nstandpoint of either preparation or defense costs.\n\n          What  is  more,    Puerto  Rico's  insolvent  insurers'\n\nliquidation  provisions  do  not  bear in  the  slightest  on the\n\nsubstantive  outcome  of  the  appeal.    These  laws  provide  a\n\nprocedure  through  which  claims  against  the  insurer  can  be\n\nresolved and  its  assets equitably  distributed.   They  do  not\n\nabsolve  the insurer of any  substantive liability.   There is no\n\nbasis  for  concluding  that  this  court  will  reach  a  result\n\nregarding the underlying  merits of Fragoso's appeal  that is any\n\ndifferent from the result  that a Puerto Rico court  would reach,\n\nhad  it stayed the action,  or that the  liquidator's forum would\n\nreach, had the action been forwarded there.\n\n          Thus, we  reject the  Commissioner's argument  that the\n\nErie  doctrine compels us to  dismiss the appeal  against CIS and\n    \n\nstay the proceeding against Lopez.\n\n               B.  Relevancy of Burford Abstention.\n                                                   \n\n          In  the alternative,  the  Commissioner urges  that  we\n\nabstain from hearing the instant appeal under the rule of Burford\n                                                                 \n\nv.

A  case such as Fragoso's, where a  trial is complete and\n\nsolely legal  questions suitable for federal appellate resolution\n\nare pending on appeal,  is a very weak candidate  for abstention.\n\nAs we have remarked before,  abstention serves \"the interests not\n\nonly  of  federalism, but  of  comity  and judicial  efficiency.\"\n\nMedical Malpractice  Joint  Underwriting Ass'n  v.

Once a federal court has rendered\n\na final  judgment, it  is questionable  whether abstention is  an\n\nefficient or practical move.   After all, the liquidator's  forum\n\nhas  no mechanism for reviewing  a federal court  decision.  What\n\nwould become  of the original judgment  is a puzzle.   In Bilden,\n                                                                \n\nwhere  the  district  court  rendered  its  judgment  before  the\n\ninsurance  company entered  liquidation proceedings,  see Bilden,\n                                                                \n\n921 F.2d at 824, the Eighth  Circuit held that an appeals court's\n\ndecision   on   the  merits   would   not   interfere  with   the\n\nrehabilitator's  control of  the  insurance company  or with  the\n\nproper  operation of the state's  regulatory format.

The appeal in Media Elements involved a coverage\n                                             \n\nissue and,  therefore, the  court reasoned that  abstention would\n\nlessen the  risk of  inconsistent coverage interpretations.   See\n                                                                 \n\nMedia Elements,  946 F.2d  at 157.    Fragoso's appeal,  however,\n              \n\nrequires  that we decide a question of law unrelated to coverage.\n\nThe case is idiocratic and fact-specific.  Passing on this appeal\n\ncould  not possibly  impair uniformity  in the  interpretation of\n\nCIS's  insurance  policies,  nor  could  doing  so  obstruct  the\n\nadjudication  of claims  against CIS  in the  liquidator's forum.\n\nThis is a singularly  important difference.

The briefs are already filed, and, as previously\n\n                                17\n\npointed out, see  supra p.7, there is no  need for oral argument.\n                       \n\nTherefore,  the concerns  that may  have warranted  abstention in\n\nMedia  Elements  are  not  present  here.

That  cannot be  the  rule.   It\n                   \n\nfollows, then,  that the mere  existence of state  procedures, or\n\neven  the existence  of  a complex  state  apparatus designed  to\n\nhandle a specific class of problems, does not necessarily justify\n\nabstention.

In   this   instance,   the   motion    for\n\nreconsideration added one  new ingredient  to the mix:   a  sworn\n\nstatement from  appellant's cousin,  Nilda Fragoso de  Rodriguez.\n\nThe  affidavit relates  that Nilda  accompanied appellant  to the\n\nlawyer's office in  December, 1984;  that the  lawyer wanted  the\n\ndecedent's medical records so that he could have them scrutinized\n\nby  an expert;  that Nilda  requested the  records from  Doctor's\n\nHospital in January of 1985; that  she returned twice more to the\n\nhospital (on  unspecified dates)  before receiving the  record on\n\nher third trip  (the date of which is also unspecified); that she\n\ntook the record  to the attorney;  that, later,  on a date  again\n\nunspecified,  she returned to  the hospital  to get  \"a certified\n\ncopy of the full record\"; that, after a few telephone inquires on\n\nunspecified dates, she received the complete record; and that she\n\ndelivered it  to  the lawyer  the  same day  (date  unspecified).\n\n                                23\n\nBereft,  as it is, of  even approximate dates,  this affidavit is\n\nmanifestly insufficient to  turn the  tide.  It  shows, at  most,\n\ndesultory   efforts  inadequate   to  demonstrate   diligence  in\n\nobtaining the records;  and, moreover, it wholly fails to suggest\n\nany good reason why appellant  and her attorney sat  complacently\n\nby for so long a period of time.\n\n          Where, as here, a motion for  summary judgment has been\n\ngranted,  \"the  district  court  has  substantial  discretion  in\n\ndeciding  whether to reopen the proceedings in order to allow the\n\nunsuccessful  party  to introduce  new  material or  argue  a new\n\ntheory.\"  Mackin v.
