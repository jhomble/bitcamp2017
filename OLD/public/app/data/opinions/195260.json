Claimant Sonia Moret Rivera appeals a \r                                \n\ndistrict  court judgment  that affirmed  the decision  of the\n\nSecretary  of Health  and  Human Services  denying claimant's\n\napplication for  Social Security  disability  benefits.   The\n\ndiscrete question before us  is whether substantial  evidence\n\nsupports  the Secretary's  conclusion that  claimant retained\n\nthe residual  functional capacity  (RFC) to perform  her past\n\nwork  as  a  secretary  before her  insured  status  expired.\n\nFinding  substantial evidence to  support this conclusion, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     On  October  18, 1990,  at  age  49, claimant  filed  an\n\ninitial application  for disability  benefits with  a Florida\n\ndistrict office of the  Social Security Administration (SSA).\n\nClaimant  alleged that she had been  disabled from work since\n\nDecember 15, 1985  due to  the surgical removal  of two  left\n\nribs, left arm numbness  and pain and back pains.   (Tr. 61).\n\nClaimant's insured  status  expired  on  December  31,  1989.\n\nClaimant graduated from high  school and received  additional\n\ntraining as a secretary  around 1961.  (Tr.65)   Between 1963\n\nand 1985, she worked as a secretary, receptionist, and office\n\nclerk at various companies  in her native Puerto Rico.   (Tr.\n\n66).   Her responsibilities  included typing letters, filing,\n\nanswering  the telephone,  using  calculators, taking  orders\r\n\nfrom customers,  and other office procedures.  (Tr. 33, 66).1\n\n     The  medical  evidence  discloses  that  claimant  began\n\nexperiencing left  wrist pain  with paresthesias of  the left\n\nupper extremity in December, 1983.  (Tr. 86).  In early 1984,\n\nclaimant was evaluated by Dr. Jose Lozada-Roman for recurrent\n\nanterior chest pain and numbness of the left arm.  (Tr. 136).\n\nX-rays of claimant's cervical spine taken on February 6, 1984\n\ndisclosed   the  presence   of  a   left  cervical   rib  and\n\nosteophytosis  (bony  growths) of  the  mid-dorsal vertebrae.\n\n(Tr. 85).  Vascular studies from that period further revealed\n\nthat  claimant  experienced  severe compression  of  the sub-\n\nclavian artery  with her  arms overhead and  mild vasospastic\n\nflow with the  arms at rest.  (Tr. 83-84).   Dr. Lozada-Roman\n\nopined that claimant's evaluation, which  included a positive\n\nAdson's test,  \"was  strongly suggestive  of thoracic  outlet\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Claimant's disability report indicated that her past work\nrequired her to perform the light exertional tasks of lifting\nweights  of  up  to  10  pounds   frequently  and  20  pounds\noccasionally,  sitting   for  four  hours  and   walking  and\nstanding, respectively, for two  hours each.  (Tr. 66).   See\r                                                                         \n20 C.F.R.  404.1567(b). \n\n                             -3-\r\n\nsyndrome.\"  (Tr. 136).2   He referred claimant to  a vascular\n\nsurgeon, Dr. Raul Garcia-Rinaldi.\n\n     On March 25, 1984, claimant was admitted to the Houston,\n\nTexas Memorial Hospital under the care of Dr. Garcia-Rinaldi.\n\nShe again reported that in  December 1983 she experienced the\n\nonset  of  left wrist  pain that  radiated  to her  elbow and\n\nassociated  numbness of  the left  hand.   Her  condition was\n\naggravated  by  physical  activity.   (Tr.  106).    She also\n\ncomplained   of  left-sided  neck   and  shoulder  pain  with\n\nparesthesias of the left upper extremity, tachycardia,  light\n\nheadedness,  palpitations,  diaphoresis,  neck,  facial,  and\n\nanterior chest flushing, diarrhea, a sensation that there was\n\na lump in her  throat, and generalized anxiety.   Dr. Garcia-\n\nRinaldi found no  increase of left wrist  pain upon sustained\n\nhyperextension  of the wrist and that  the distal pulses were\n\nsymmetrical at rest.  (Tr. 107).   His initial impression was\n\nthat  claimant suffered from  a left  cervical rib,  rule out\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  Thoracic outlet syndrome is \"compression of  the brachial\nplexus  nerve   trunks,  characterized   by  pain   in  arms,\nparesthesia of  fingers, vasomotor symptoms  ... and weakness\nand wasting of small muscles of the hand; it may be caused by\ndrooping shoulder girdle, a cervical rib or fibrous band,  an\nabnormal first  rib, continual hyperabduction of  the arm, or\n(rarely)  compression of  the edge  of the  scalenus anterior\nmuscle.\"   R. Sloane,  The Sloane-Dorland  Annotated Medical-\r                                                                         \nLegal  Dictionary (1987), p. 697.  Adson's test is one method\r                             \nof   diagnosing   thoracic   outlet   syndrome.     Dorland's\r                                                                         \nIllustrated Medical Dictionary, (27th ed. 1988), p. 1674.\r                                          \n\n                             -4-\r\n\nthoracic  outlet  syndrome, and  generalized  anxiety  with a\n\nhistory of acute anxiety attacks.  (Tr. 107.)3\n\n     On  March  26,  1984,  Dr.  William  Fleming   evaluated\n\nclaimant as a consultant to Dr. Garcia-Rinaldi.  Dr.  Fleming\n\nfound that claimant exhibited  a full range of motion  of the\n\ncervical  spine,   although  she  complained  of   a  popping\n\nsensation  when  she turned  her  neck.    Tinel's  sign  was\n\npositive  at both wrists,  the left greater  than the right.4\n\nThere  was moderate  weakness of  the left  abductor pollicis\n\nbrevis muscle (i.e.,  the muscle  between the  wrist and  the\r                               \n\nfirst  joint of  the thumb)  and  decreased sensation  in the\n\nfirst  three  fingers  of  the   left  arm.    Dr.  Fleming's\n\nimpression was  that claimant  had left median  neuropathy of\n\nthe  wrist   (carpal  tunnel  syndrome).5     Other  possible\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Claimant  does not argue that she is disabled as a result\nof anxiety or any other mental impairment.\n\n4.  Tinel's sign is  \"a tingling sensation in  the distal end\nof a  limb when percussion is made over the site of a divided\nnerve.   It  indicates  a  partial  lesion or  the  beginning\nregeneration of  the nerve.\"   Dorland's  Illustrated Medical\r                                                                         \nDictionary,  at  1526. \"The  sign  is  often present  in  the\r                      \nabnormal  tingling  sensation in  the  fingers  and the  hand\n(carpal tunnel syndrome).\"   The Mosby Medical  Encyclopedia,\r                                                                        \n(1985), p. 730.\n\n5.  Carpal  tunnel   syndrome  is  \"a   complex  of  symptoms\nresulting from compression of the median nerve  in the carpal\ntunnel, with pain and burning or tingling paresthesias in the\nfingers  and  hand,   sometimes  extending  to  the   elbow.\"\nDorland's  Illustrated Medical  Dictionary, at  1632.   \"This\r                                                      \ncompression produces paresthesias in the radial-palmar aspect\nof the hand plus pain in the wrist, in the palm, or sometimes\nproximal to the compression site in the forearm and shoulder.\nSensory deficit  in the  first 3  digits and/or weakness  and\n\n                             -5-\r\n\nconditions  to be  ruled out  were thoracic  outlet syndrome,\n\nleft  brachial plexopathy,  and cervical  radiculopathy. (Tr.\n\n103).    Dr.  Fleming  recommended  an  electromyogram, nerve\n\nconduction  studies,  and  x-rays  of  both  wrists  and  the\n\ncervical spine.  \n\n     A March  27, 1984  electromyogram was normal.  (Tr. 86).\n\nIn  addition, cervical spine films  and x-rays of both wrists\n\nwere within normal limits except for the presence of the left\n\ncervical rib that had been previously found.   (Tr. 86).  The\n\nrecord suggests that no nerve conduction studies were done in\n\n1984.    On  March  29, 1984,  Dr.  Garcia-Rinaldi  diagnosed\n\nclaimant to be suffering from thoracic outlet syndrome due to\n\ncompression  of the  subclavian arteries  caused by  the left\n\ncervical  and  first  ribs.    (Tr.  93).    He  performed  a\n\ntransaxillary resection of these  ribs.  His operative report\n\nindicates  that  when the  rib  sections  were removed,  \"the\n\nsubclavian   artery  and   its   veins  were   released\"  and\n\n\"[e]xcellent   distal  pulsations   were   obtained  in   all\n\npositions.\" (Tr. 93).6 \n\n                    \r                                \n\natrophy  in  the  muscles  controlling  thumb  abduction  and\napposition may  follow.\"   The Merck Manual,  (Robert Berkow,\r                                                       \nM.D., et al., eds., 16th ed. 1992), p. 1519.\n\n6.  Dr.  Garcia-Rinaldi  later  submitted  a  letter  to  the\nFlorida  disability  evaluation  service in  connection  with\nclaimant's  initial application.   There  he stated  that the\ndiagnosis of  thoracic outlet syndrome resulting  from a left\ncervical rib  \"was quite clear\" and that,  to the best of his\nknowledge,  claimant had  satisfactory results  following the\nMarch  1984  surgery.   (Tr.  132).    During  the course  of\n\n                             -6-\r\n\n     Claimant was  discharged from  the hospital on  April 3,\n\n1984.  She returned  to work after the surgery  and continued\n\nto work until December 1985.  Claimant alleges that while she\n\nexperienced  some  improvement  following  the  surgery,  she\n\ncontinued to experience arm pain and numbness that eventually\n\nadversely affected her work performance and caused her  to be\n\nfired.7  Claimant has  not worked since the alleged  onset of\n\nher disability on December 15, 1985. \n\n     There are no medical  records from 1985, 1986, or  1987.\n\nBetween  August 12, 1988 and April 1991, Dr. Tomas Jordan saw\n\nclaimant five times  per year for various conditions.   While\n\nDr.  Jordan's office  records  are  largely  illegible,  they\n\nindicate  that  claimant had  a  history  of thoracic  outlet\n\nsyndrome  that was  treated with  the surgical  removal of  a\n\ncervical  rib.  (Tr. 108).   Dr. Jordan  treated claimant for\n\nnumbness of the left arm, cervical spasm and hematuria during\n\nAugust and September 1988.  He prescribed  Decadron, an anti-\n\ninflammatory drug,  and other medications.  (Tr. 124-27).  X-\n\nrays  from  that time  disclosed  mild  straightening of  the\n\n                    \r                                \n\nclaimant's  1984  hospitalization  claimant   also  underwent\ntesting for chest pain and other problems.  She  was found to\nhave  chronic  esophagitis  and bladder  polyps,  which  were\nremoved.  (Tr. 86, 89). \n\n7.  Claimant's  disability report states  that the operation,\nwhich  was  performed  under   her  left  arm,  caused  \"slow\nmovement\"  of her arm.   Claimant reported that  as a result,\nshe  kept getting slower at work and that she did not perform\nher work with accuracy.  (Tr. 61). \n\n                             -7-\r\n\ncervical spine  and mild  osteophytes of the  thoracic spine.\n\n(Tr. 131).  Dr.  Jordan indicated that claimant's impairments\n\nincluded  carpal tunnel  syndrome, cervical  myositis, hiatal\n\nhernia,  microhematuria,  gastritis,   and  irritable   colon\n\nsyndrome.  (Tr. 112).  However,  he did not specify when  she\n\nsuffered from symptoms associated  with these conditions, nor\n\ndid  he state  that any  of these  conditions  were disabling\n\neither  during  or after  the insured  period.     Dr. Jordan\n\nreferred claimant  to a  physiatrist for her  thoracic outlet\n\nsyndrome  and prescribed  medications, physical  therapy, and\n\ndiet for her other symptoms. (Tr. 108, 112). \n\n     On  December  17, 1990,  claimant  was  examined by  Dr.\n\nPercival Tamayo, a Florida internist and SSA consultant.   At\n\nthat  time claimant  reported that  she could  still do  some\n\nhousework and  lift weights less  than ten pounds.   Physical\n\nexamination disclosed  that  claimant's neck  was supple  and\n\nthat  claimant   exhibited  no  pain   on  hyperextension  or\n\nrotation.   The  back  showed  no  significant  paravertebral\n\nmuscle spasm and no  spine deformity.  Her  lower extremities\n\nwere normal.  There was no significant reduction in the range\n\nof motion in claimant's cervical or lumbar spine, and no pain\n\nwas   produced   during   the   range  of   motion   testing.\n\nNeurological examination was grossly unremarkable.  Palpation\n\nof the chest wall  elicited tenderness over the costochondral\n\njunction at the  second and third  rib levels, especially  on\n\n                             -8-\r\n\nthe left side.   Dr. Tamayo concluded that  claimant suffered\n\nfrom  non-cardiac chest pain  consistent with costochondritis\n\n(an inflammation of the cartilage  connecting the ribs to the\n\nsternum)  and that  her residual left  arm discomfort  may be\n\nsecondary to her previous thoracic outlet syndrome.  No other\n\nsignificant abnormalities were noted.  (Tr. 133-34).  \n\n     Dr. Lozada-Roman also submitted a report dated 12/20/90.\n\nIn  addition to  the aforementioned  history, he  stated that\n\nclaimant was then experiencing  \"some discomfort\" in the left\n\narm  and   difficulty  writing  and  lifting   objects.    He\n\nrecommended  that she again see a vascular surgeon and have a\n\nneurological evaluation.  (Tr. 136).  \n\n     On January  2, 1991, claimant's initial  application was\n\ndenied.  She immediately  filed a request for reconsideration\n\nwhich  was also  denied.   Claimant  filed  a request  for  a\n\nhearing   before  an  administrative   law  judge  (ALJ)  and\n\nsubmitted  additional medical  evidence.   On April  9, 1991,\n\nclaimant saw  Dr. Victor  Gonzalez, a specialist  in physical\n\nmedicine and rehabilitation.  (Tr. 137-38).   His records are\n\nalso largely illegible.   Nevertheless, Dr. Gonzalez reported\n\nthat claimant was  experiencing pain in her  chest and elbows\n\nin 1991, as  well as numbness  of both arms,  more so on  the\n\nleft.   Claimant also alleged  that she had pain  in her left\n\nhip.  Physical examination disclosed tenderness on  palpation\n\nof the cervical resection area.  A 4/10/91 note suggests that\n\n                             -9-\r\n\nclaimant's   symptoms  were  consistent  with  carpal  tunnel\n\nsyndrome and thoracic outlet syndrome.  (Tr. 138).\n\n     An  April 17,  1991  electromyogram of  claimant's upper\n\nlimbs was  normal.   (Tr.  113).   However, nerve  conduction\n\nstudies from  that date showed  early signs of  carpal tunnel\n\nsyndrome  and entrapment  neuropathy  of the  ulnar nerve  at\n\nGuyon's canal.   April 1991 x-rays of claimant's lumbar spine\n\nwere normal.  (Tr. 151-53).   On May 24,  1991, claimant  had\n\nanother vascular  study.  This disclosed  mild compression of\n\nthe right subclavian artery  with the arm to side  and arm to\n\nback maneuvers and severe compression with the arms overhead.\n\nThe left  subclavian artery  also exhibited mild  compression\n\nwith the  arms overhead.   Claimant's circulation  was normal\n\nwith  her  arms  at   rest,  although  she  experienced  mild\n\nvasospastic flow in both hands.     Dr. Ivette Matos Serrano,\n\na  neurologist, began  treating claimant  around 1991.   (Tr.\n\n28).   On  June  20,  1991,  one  and  one-half  years  after\n\nclaimant's  insured status  expired, Dr. Matos  reported that\n\nclaimant was  experiencing numbness in the  posterior part of\n\nthe head,  frequent headaches,  paresthesias, cramps  of both\n\nupper extremities, and \"an  electric-like sensation along the\n\nposterior aspect  of the  left  upper extremity  down to  the\n\nfingers[.]\"    The  remainder  of her  report  suggests  that\n\nclaimant's  condition was  considerably  more dire  than that\n\ndescribed by Dr.  Tamayo, the SSA's consultant.  For example,\n\n                             -10-\r\n\nDr. Matos indicated  that claimant had  muscle spasms in  her\n\ncervical,  paravertebral,  and  trapezius  muscles,  that her\n\nrange of motion testing revealed significant limitations  and\n\npain, and that claimant exhibited diminished sensation in her\n\nleft arm  and leg  and \"slight  weakness\" of  both handgrips.\n\nBased  on her  examination  and the  1991 vascular  and nerve\n\nconduction  studies,  Dr.  Matos  diagnosed  claimant  to  be\n\nsuffering from  severe  bilateral thoracic  outlet  syndrome,\n\nchronic cervical syndrome,  bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome,\n\nbilateral  entrapment neuropathy  of  the ulnar  nerves,  and\n\nchronic  lumbar  syndrome with  clinical  signs and  symptoms\n\nsuggesting  radicular   involvement.    She   concluded  that\n\nclaimant had suffered from bilateral thoracic outlet syndrome\n\nsince 1983,  and that while she  experienced some improvement\n\non her  left side following  surgery in  1984, her  condition\n\nbecame   progressively aggravated.   Dr. Matos opined that it\n\nwas   understandable  for   claimant's  symptoms   to  remain\n\nfollowing surgery as in many patients symptoms do recur.  She\n\nadvised that claimant would continue to need treatment for an\n\nindefinite time  and that  her labor prognosis  was extremely\n\npoor.    However, Dr.  Matos did  not  express an  opinion on\n\nwhether  claimant  was disabled  during  the  insured period.\n\n(Tr. 142-47).\n\n     Claimant and her attorney  appeared for a hearing before\n\nan ALJ on August 1, 1991.   Claimant testified that she could\n\n                             -11-\r\n\nno  longer work  as  a  result  of  her  1984  operation  and\n\ncontinuing pain and  numbness.  She explained that  after her\n\noperation, her \"ability to work  decreased\" and she was fired\n\nas a result.  (Tr. 25).8  Claimant asserted that  she did not\n\ngo back  to work  because she  felt \"ill\"  and \"demoralized\",\n\nnoting  that she  experienced  \"lots of  pains  in the  neck,\n\nmuscular  spasms which  continued after  the operation[,  and\n\nher]  arms got numb.\"  (Tr. 26).  While claimant acknowledged\n\nthat  she experienced some  improvement after  the operation,\n\npains  and  numbness  of   both  arms  continued.    Claimant\n\ntestified that she  is incapacitated because of the  pain she\n\nconstantly feels.  (Tr. 26, 32.)9 \n\n     On August 27,  1991, the ALJ  issued a decision  denying\n\nclaimant's application  for benefits.   The  ALJ specifically\n\nfound  that  during  the  relevant insured  period,  claimant\n\nsuffered from severe cervical myositis and status post trans-\n\naxillary  resection  of her  left  cervical  and first  ribs.\n\nAlthough  these conditions  did not  meet or equal  the SSA's\n\n                    \r                                \n\n8.  We note that claimant indicated that her employer did not\nadmit that her  health problems cause her to be  fired.  (Tr.\n61).    Moreover,  Dr.   Matos  reported  that  claimant  was\ndismissed from  her job because  of a nervous  condition, not\nbecause of her physical complaints.  (Tr. 143). \n\n9.  Claimant  also  stated that  she had  problems swallowing\nrelated to her esophagus and hiatal hernia, and cramps in her\narms and legs.  (Tr. 26).  She testified that she experienced\nstrong neck and back pain which is only  temporarily relieved\nwith  medication and that she  can only sit  and stand for 10\nminutes at a time.  (Tr. 34-37).\n\n                             -12-\r\n\nlistings  of impairments,  the  ALJ found  that they  imposed\n\nsignificant limitations  on  claimant's ability  to lift  and\n\ncarry.   With respect  to claimant's  complaints of  pain and\n\nnumbness, the ALJ found:                                     \n\n          ... the claimant's neck pain is sustained\n          as  being  secondary   to  her   cervical\n          myositis evidenced  by mild straightening\n          of   the   cervical   spine.     However,\n          subsequent to the  claimant's surgery  on\n          March  29,  1984,  she  did  not  present\n          objective clinical findings  in which  to\n          sustain  her allegations of chest pain or\n          left arm numbness until subsequent to the\n          critical  period  in   issue.     Through\n          December 31, 1989,  the claimant was  not\n          prescribed strong analgesics and there is\n          no  evidence of  significant restrictions\n          in  her  daily   activities  and   social\n          functioning  suggestive of  her inability\n          to perform within all exertional levels.\n\nBased  on these  findings,  the ALJ  concluded that  claimant\n\nretained   the  residual   functional  capacity   to  perform\n\nsedentary  work through December 31, 1989.  (Tr. 15, 16).  He\n\nthen went on to conclude  that claimant's impairments did not\n\ndisable  her  from  performing  her  past  light  work  as  a\r                                                            \n\nsecretary.  (Tr. 15,  16).10   Consequently,  the ALJ  denied\n\n                    \r                                \n\n10.  The  ALJ specifically  found that  claimant's  past work\n\"involved sitting four hours, standing and walking two hours,\nrespectively, frequent  bending and reaching and  lifting and\ncarrying  10 pounds  frequently  and 20  pounds occasionally.\n(Tr.  14).    As  noted  above  at  n.  1,  these  exertional\nrequirements are  consistent with light work.   Moreover, the\nALJ also found  that claimant  has the RFC  \"to perform  work\nrelated  activities  except  for work  involving  lifting and\ncarrying   over   10   pounds   frequently   and  20   pounds\r                           \noccasionally.\"   (Tr. 16).  Implicit in this statement is the\nassertion that claimant  can lift up to 10  pounds frequently\nand 20 pounds occasionally. \n\n                             -13-\r\n\nbenefits at  step four of the  sequential evaluation process.\n\nSee Goodermote v.

The Appeals  Council denied\n\nreview, thus  rendering the  ALJ's decision final.   Claimant\n\nsought judicial review pursuant  to 42 U.S.C.  405(g).    The\n\ndistrict court summarily affirmed the Secretary.  This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                             II.\n\n     On appeal,  claimant argues  that the ALJ's  decision is\n\nnot  supported  by substantial  evidence on  the record  as a\n\nwhole because the ALJ  ignored the uncontroverted evidence of\n\ndisability  provided by  Drs. Jordan,  Tamayo, and  Matos and\n\nsubstituted his own, unqualified  medical opinion in place of\n\nthe  evidence provided  by these  physicians.   Claimant says\n\nthat  the  medical  evidence  provided  by  these  physicians\n\nestablished that she is at least disabled from performing her\n\npast secretarial work due to thoracic outlet syndrome, carpal\n\ntunnel  syndrome,  left arm  numbness,  and  pain.   Claimant\n\nfurther  argues that the ALJ erred in concluding that she has\n\nthe residual  functional capacity  (RFC) to perform  her past\n\nrelevant  work  absent  an  RFC assessment  by  a  physician.\n\nFinally,  claimant  contends  that  the ALJ  failed  to  give\n\nappropriate  consideration  to  her  complaints  of disabling\n\npain.\n\n                             -14-\r\n\n     We  must  affirm  the  Secretary's  decision  if  it  is\n\nsupported by substantial  evidence on the record as  a whole.\n\nRodriguez v.

Secretary  of  Health  and  Human\r                                                                         \n\nServices,  818 F.2d 96, 97 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 497 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n1042  (1987).   It  is  not  sufficient  for  a  claimant  to\n\nestablish that her impairment  had its roots before  the date\n\nthat her insured  status expired.  Rather, the  claimant must\n\nshow  that her  impairment(s)  reached a  disabling level  of\n\nseverity  by that date.   See, e.g., Deblois  v. Secretary of\r                                                                         \n\nHealth and Human Services,  686 F.2d 76, 79 (1st  Cir. 1982);\r                                     \n\nTremblay v.

This  does not mean,  however, that\n\nmedical  evidence  from  the  post-insured  period  is always\n\nwholly  irrelevant.    Medical  evidence  generated  after  a\n\nclaimant's insured status expires  may be considered for what\n\nlight  (if any) it  sheds on the  question whether claimant's\n\nimpairment(s)  reached  disabling severity  before claimant's\r                                                              \n\ninsured  status expired.

Supp. 669, 672-73 (D.P.R. 1985).    \r                    \n\n     While we  think claimant overstates the  strength of the\n\nevidence from Drs. Jordan, Tamayo, and Matos, we are troubled\n\nby the ALJ's finding that  claimant did not present objective\n\nclinical  findings to  sustain  her allegations  of left  arm\n\nnumbness until after her insured status expired in 1989.  Dr.\n\nJordan  recorded  that  claimant  was experiencing  left  arm\n\nnumbness in  connection with  cervical spasm in  August 1988.\n\n(Tr.  127).   And  while claimant  was not  prescribed strong\n\nanalgesics through December 31 1989, Dr. Jordan did prescribe\n\nDecadron,  an anti-inflammatory  medication, in  August 1988.\n\n(Tr.  126).   The record  as a  whole suggests  that claimant\n\nsuffered  from  symptoms  associated  with   thoracic  outlet\n\nsyndrome both  before and  after her insured  status expired.\n\nArguably, the  ALJ should  have considered this  condition in\n\nevaluating claimant's RFC.    \n\n     Nevertheless,  we  cannot  say  that the  ALJ  erred  in\n\ndiscounting the  evidence from the post-insured  period.  The\n\nrecord  discloses that for at  least three of  the five years\n\nafter the alleged date of onset (i.e., 1985, 1986, and 1987),\n\nclaimant sought no medical  treatment.  A gap in  the medical\n\nevidence may itself be evidence that claimant's condition was\n\nnot as  dire as alleged.   See Irlanda Ortiz  v. Secretary of\r                                                                         \n\nHealth and  Human  Services,  955 F.2d  765,  769  (1st  Cir.\r                                       \n\n                             -16-\r\n\n1991)(gaps  in  record supported  conclusion  that claimant's\n\npain  was not  as intense as  alleged).  Apart  from one 1988\n\ncomplaint of  numbness and cervical spasm,  which was treated\n\nwith Decadron, there is no evidence that claimant's condition\n\nwas  particularly troubling  during the  insured  period that\n\nremained after  her surgery, much  less disabling.   We think\n\nthat a  single  complaint  of numbness  and  spasm  does  not\n\nundermine the ALJ's conclusion that claimant retained the RFC\n\nto  perform sedentary  work during  the insured period.   See\r                                                                         \n\nGordils v. Secretary of  Health and Human Services,  921 F.2d\r                                                              \n\n327, 329 (1st Cir. 1990)(\"if the only medical findings in the\n\nrecord suggest that a claimant exhibited little in the way of\n\nphysical  impairments,  but nowhere  in  the  record did  any\n\nphysician state in functional terms that the claimant had the\n\nexertional  capacity  to meet  the requirements  of sedentary\n\nwork, the  ALJ would  be permitted  to reach that  functional\n\nconclusion himself\").   This conclusion  is further supported\n\nby the ALJ's finding that there is no evidence of significant\n\nrestrictions   in  claimant's  daily  activities  and  social\n\nfunctioning during the insured period.11  We  recognize  that\n\n                    \r                                \n\n11.  To be sure,  claimant testified that she  had not driven\nin 3 or 4 years, that her daughter did most of the housework,\nand  that while  she goes to  church, she spends  most of her\ntime lying down due  to her various ailments.   (Tr. 24,  33,\n39).   But  it is  clear that  claimant was  speaking of  her\ncondition  at the present, and did not focus on her condition\nbetween 1985 and 1989.  As it was claimant's burden  to prove\nthat  she was  disabled  before her  insured status  expired,\nclaimant  was required  to adduce  evidence on  her condition\n\n                             -17-\r\n\nthe ALJ did not stop there, however, and went  on to conclude\n\nthat claimant retained the RFC to perform her past light work\r                                                                    \n\nas  a secretary.

See 921  F.2d  at 329.12   Claimant\r                                         \n\nargues that the ALJ erred  by concluding that claimant  could\n\nperform light work without  an RFC from a physician.  We have\n\nrepeatedly admonished  that ALJs generally  are not qualified\n\nto  assess RFC  based on  a bare  medical record.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nGordils,  921  F.2d at  329;  Rivera-Torres  v.

(Tr. 64).\nGiven  the  gap in  the  medical  evidence from  the  insured\nperiod, this supports the ALJ's conclusion that the sedentary\nbase was intact during that time.\n\n12.  We note  that in  Gordils, a nonexamining  physician had\r                                          \nindicated that claimant could do light work.

However, in  order to trigger\n\nthis requirement,  the claimant  must  first put  her RFC  in\n\nissue.   Thus, in Santiago  v. Secretary of  Health and Human\r                                                                         \n\nServices, 944 F.2d 1,  4 (1st Cir. 1992), we upheld  an ALJ's\r                    \n\ndetermination that a claimant retained the RFC to perform her\n\npast, light  work  as a  sewing  machine operator  absent  an\n\nexpert's  RFC because the  record demonstrated  that claimant\n\nhad \"only  relatively mild mental  and physical  impairments\"\n\nand claimant never clarified the particular respects in which\n\nher impairments prevented her  from performing her past work.\n\nWe  emphasized that to meet the burden  of proof at step 4, a\n\nclaimant  must produce  evidence of  the physical  and mental\n\ndemands of her prior work and describe how  her impairment(s)\n\nprecluded  the  performance of  that  work  \"in the  relevant\r                                                                         \n\nperiod.\" Id. at 5.  \r                        \n\n     Here, while  the claimant described both  her duties and\n\nher  present  impairments,  neither  her  testimony  nor  the\r                        \n\nmedical evidence explained how  her impairments precluded the\n\nperformance of work-related tasks  during the insured period.\n\nRather,  the  record  as   a  whole  suggests  that  claimant\n\nrecovered from her surgery and did not seek treatment for the\n\nthree  years that ensued (1985,  1986, and 1987).   And while\n\nclaimant  sought  treatment  again  in  1988,  there  was  no\n\n                             -19-\r\n\nevidence  as  to the  frequency or  duration of  her symptoms\n\nduring  the relevant period, nor did claimant explain how her\n\nsymptoms  precluded  the  performance  of  the  various tasks\n\nassociated  with her past work during that time.  Thus, where\n\nclaimant failed  to focus her  proof on the  relevant insured\n\nperiod,  and the  medical  evidence from  that time  does not\n\nsuggest  that claimant  continuously suffered  from disabling\n\nsymptoms,  we  think  the  ALJ   supportably  concluded  that\n\nclaimant  retained  the RFC  to perform  her  past work  as a\n\nsecretary notwithstanding the absence of a physician's RFC. \n\n     Finally,  claimant  argues that  the  ALJ  did not  give\n\nsufficient weight to her complaints  of disabling pain.  Once\n\nagain,  this  argument fails  because  the  claimant did  not\n\nspecify how her pain limited her functions during the insured\n\nperiod.

The discrete question before us is whether substantial evidence supports the Secretary's conclusion that claimant retained the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform her past work as a secretary before her insured status expired.  Finding substantial evidence to support this conclusion, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 18, 1990, at age 49, claimant filed an initial application for disability benefits with a Florida district office of the Social Security Administration (SSA).  Claimant alleged that she had been disabled from work since December 15, 1985 due to the surgical removal of two left ribs, left arm numbness and pain and back pains.  (Tr. 61).  Claimant's insured status expired on December 31, 1989.  Claimant graduated from high school and received additional training as a secretary around 1961.  (Tr.65) Between 1963 and 1985, she worked as a secretary, receptionist, and office clerk at various companies in her native Puerto Rico.  (Tr. 66).  Her responsibilities included typing letters, filing, answering the telephone, using calculators, taking orders from customers, and other office procedures.  (Tr. 33, 66).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical evidence discloses that claimant began experiencing left wrist pain with paresthesias of the left upper extremity in December, 1983.  (Tr. 86).  In early 1984, claimant was evaluated by Dr. Jose Lozada-Roman for recurrent anterior chest pain and numbness of the left arm.  (Tr. 136).  X-rays of claimant's cervical spine taken on February 6, 1984 disclosed the presence of a left cervical rib and osteophytosis (bony growths) of the mid-dorsal vertebrae.  (Tr. 85).  Vascular studies from that period further revealed that claimant experienced severe compression of the sub-clavian artery with her arms overhead and mild vasospastic flow with the arms at rest.  (Tr. 83-84).  Dr. Lozada-Roman opined that claimant's evaluation, which included a positive Adson's test, \"was strongly suggestive of thoracic outlet syndrome.\"  (Tr. 136).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He referred claimant to a vascular surgeon, Dr. Raul Garcia-Rinaldi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 25, 1984, claimant was admitted to the Houston, Texas Memorial Hospital under the care of Dr. Garcia-Rinaldi.  She again reported that in December 1983 she experienced the onset of left wrist pain that radiated to her elbow and associated numbness of the left hand.  Her condition was aggravated by physical activity.  (Tr. 106).  She also complained of left-sided neck and shoulder pain with paresthesias of the left upper extremity, tachycardia, light headedness, palpitations, diaphoresis, neck, facial, and anterior chest flushing, diarrhea, a sensation that there was a lump in her throat, and generalized anxiety.  Dr. Garcia- Rinaldi found no increase of left wrist pain upon sustained hyperextension of the wrist and that the distal pulses were symmetrical at rest.  (Tr. 107).  His initial impression was that claimant suffered from a left cervical rib, rule out thoracic outlet syndrome, and generalized anxiety with a history of acute anxiety attacks.  (Tr. 107.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 1984, Dr. William Fleming evaluated claimant as a consultant to Dr. Garcia-Rinaldi.  Dr. Fleming found that claimant exhibited a full range of motion of the cervical spine, although she complained of a popping sensation when she turned her neck.  Tinel's sign was positive at both wrists, the left greater than the right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  There was moderate weakness of the left abductor pollicis brevis muscle (i.e., the muscle between the wrist and the first joint of the thumb) and decreased sensation in the first three fingers of the left arm.  Dr. Fleming's impression was that claimant had left median neuropathy of the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Other possible conditions to be ruled out were thoracic outlet syndrome, left brachial plexopathy, and cervical radiculopathy.  (Tr. 103).  Dr. Fleming recommended an electromyogram, nerve conduction studies, and x-rays of both wrists and the cervical spine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A March 27, 1984 electromyogram was normal.  (Tr. 86).  In addition, cervical spine films and x-rays of both wrists were within normal limits except for the presence of the left cervical rib that had been previously found.  (Tr. 86).  The record suggests that no nerve conduction studies were done in 1984.  On March 29, 1984, Dr. Garcia-Rinaldi diagnosed claimant to be suffering from thoracic outlet syndrome due to compression of the subclavian arteries caused by the left cervical and first ribs.  (Tr. 93).  He performed a transaxillary resection of these ribs.  His operative report indicates that when the rib sections were removed, \"the subclavian artery and its veins were released\" and \"[e]xcellent distal pulsations were obtained in all positions.\"  (Tr. 93).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant was discharged from the hospital on April 3, 1984.  She returned to work after the surgery and continued to work until December 1985.  Claimant alleges that while she experienced some improvement following the surgery, she continued to experience arm pain and numbness that eventually adversely affected her work performance and caused her to be fired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Claimant has not worked since the alleged onset of her disability on December 15, 1985.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no medical records from 1985, 1986, or 1987.  Between August 12, 1988 and April 1991, Dr. Tomas Jordan saw claimant five times per year for various conditions.  While Dr. Jordan's office records are largely illegible, they indicate that claimant had a history of thoracic outlet syndrome that was treated with the surgical removal of a cervical rib.  (Tr. 108).  Dr. Jordan treated claimant for numbness of the left arm, cervical spasm and hematuria during August and September 1988.  He prescribed Decadron, an anti-inflammatory drug, and other medications.  (Tr. 124-27).  X-rays from that time disclosed mild straightening of the cervical spine and mild osteophytes of the thoracic spine.  (Tr. 131).  Dr. Jordan indicated that claimant's impairments included carpal tunnel syndrome, cervical myositis, hiatal hernia, microhematuria, gastritis, and irritable colon syndrome.  (Tr. 112).  However, he did not specify when she suffered from symptoms associated with these conditions, nor did he state that any of these conditions were disabling either during or after the insured period.  Dr. Jordan referred claimant to a physiatrist for her thoracic outlet syndrome and prescribed medications, physical therapy, and diet for her other symptoms.  (Tr. 108, 112).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1990, claimant was examined by Dr. Percival Tamayo, a Florida internist and SSA consultant.  At that time claimant reported that she could still do some housework and lift weights less than ten pounds.  Physical examination disclosed that claimant's neck was supple and that claimant exhibited no pain on hyperextension or rotation.  The back showed no significant paravertebral muscle spasm and no spine deformity.  Her lower extremities were normal.  There was no significant reduction in the range of motion in claimant's cervical or lumbar spine, and no pain was produced during the range of motion testing.  Neurological examination was grossly unremarkable.  Palpation of the chest wall elicited tenderness over the costochondral junction at the second and third rib levels, especially on the left side.  Dr. Tamayo concluded that claimant suffered from non-cardiac chest pain consistent with costochondritis (an inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the sternum) and that her residual left arm discomfort may be secondary to her previous thoracic outlet syndrome.  No other significant abnormalities were noted.  (Tr. 133-34).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Lozada-Roman also submitted a report dated 12/20/90.  In addition to the aforementioned history, he stated that claimant was then experiencing \"some discomfort\" in the left arm and difficulty writing and lifting objects.  He recommended that she again see a vascular surgeon and have a neurological evaluation.  (Tr. 136).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 1991, claimant's initial application was denied.  She immediately filed a request for reconsideration which was also denied.  Claimant filed a request for a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) and submitted additional medical evidence.  On April 9, 1991, claimant saw Dr. Victor Gonzalez, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation.  (Tr. 137-38).  His records are also largely illegible.  Nevertheless, Dr. Gonzalez reported that claimant was experiencing pain in her chest and elbows in 1991, as well as numbness of both arms, more so on the left.  Claimant also alleged that she had pain in her left hip.  Physical examination disclosed tenderness on palpation of the cervical resection area.  A 4/10/91 note suggests that claimant's symptoms were consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome and thoracic outlet syndrome.  (Tr. 138).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An April 17, 1991 electromyogram of claimant's upper limbs was normal.  (Tr. 113).  However, nerve conduction studies from that date showed early signs of carpal tunnel syndrome and entrapment neuropathy of the ulnar nerve at Guyon's canal.  April 1991 x-rays of claimant's lumbar spine were normal.  (Tr. 151-53).  On May 24, 1991, claimant had another vascular study.  This disclosed mild compression of the right subclavian artery with the arm to side and arm to back maneuvers and severe compression with the arms overhead.  The left subclavian artery also exhibited mild compression with the arms overhead.  Claimant's circulation was normal with her arms at rest, although she experienced mild vasospastic flow in both hands.  Dr. Ivette Matos Serrano, a neurologist, began treating claimant around 1991.  (Tr. 28).  On June 20, 1991, one and one-half years after claimant's insured status expired, Dr. Matos reported that claimant was experiencing numbness in the posterior part of the head, frequent headaches, paresthesias, cramps of both upper extremities, and \"an electric-like sensation along the posterior aspect of the left upper extremity down to the fingers[.]\"  The remainder of her report suggests that claimant's condition was considerably more dire than that described by Dr. Tamayo, the SSA's consultant.  For example, Dr. Matos indicated that claimant had muscle spasms in her cervical, paravertebral, and trapezius muscles, that her range of motion testing revealed significant limitations and pain, and that claimant exhibited diminished sensation in her left arm and leg and \"slight weakness\" of both handgrips.  Based on her examination and the 1991 vascular and nerve conduction studies, Dr. Matos diagnosed claimant to be suffering from severe bilateral thoracic outlet syndrome, chronic cervical syndrome, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral entrapment neuropathy of the ulnar nerves, and chronic lumbar syndrome with clinical signs and symptoms suggesting radicular involvement.  She concluded that claimant had suffered from bilateral thoracic outlet syndrome since 1983, and that while she experienced some improvement on her left side following surgery in 1984, her condition became progressively aggravated.  Dr. Matos opined that it was understandable for claimant's symptoms to remain following surgery as in many patients symptoms do recur.  She advised that claimant would continue to need treatment for an indefinite time and that her labor prognosis was extremely poor.  However, Dr. Matos did not express an opinion on whether claimant was disabled during the insured period.  (Tr. 142-47).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant and her attorney appeared for a hearing before an ALJ on August 1, 1991.  Claimant testified that she could no longer work as a result of her 1984 operation and continuing pain and numbness.  She explained that after her operation, her \"ability to work decreased\" and she was fired as a result.  (Tr. 25).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Claimant asserted that she did not go back to work because she felt \"ill\" and \"demoralized\", noting that she experienced \"lots of pains in the neck, muscular spasms which continued after the operation[, and her] arms got numb.\"  (Tr. 26).  While claimant acknowledged that she experienced some improvement after the operation, pains and numbness of both arms continued.  Claimant testified that she is incapacitated because of the pain she constantly feels.  (Tr. 26, 32.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 27, 1991, the ALJ issued a decision denying claimant's application for benefits.  The ALJ specifically found that during the relevant insured period, claimant suffered from severe cervical myositis and status post trans- axillary resection of her left cervical and first ribs.  Although these conditions did not meet or equal the SSA's listings of impairments, the ALJ found that they imposed significant limitations on claimant's ability to lift and carry.  With respect to claimant's complaints of pain and numbness, the ALJ found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>... the claimant's neck pain is sustained as being secondary to her cervical myositis evidenced by mild straightening of the cervical spine.  However, subsequent to the claimant's surgery on March 29, 1984, she did not present objective clinical findings in which to sustain her allegations of chest pain or left arm numbness until subsequent to the critical period in issue.  Through December 31, 1989, the claimant was not prescribed strong analgesics and there is no evidence of significant restrictions in her daily activities and social functioning suggestive of her inability to perform within all exertional levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these findings, the ALJ concluded that claimant retained the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work through December 31, 1989.  (Tr. 15, 16).  He then went on to conclude that claimant's impairments did not disable her from performing her past light work as a secretary.  (Tr. 15, 16).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Consequently, the ALJ denied benefits at step four of the sequential evaluation process.   See Goodermote v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 690 F. 2d 5, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1982).  The Appeals Council denied review, thus rendering the ALJ's decision final.  Claimant sought judicial review pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 405(g).  The district court summarily affirmed the Secretary.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, claimant argues that the ALJ's decision is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole because the ALJ ignored the uncontroverted evidence of disability provided by Drs. Jordan, Tamayo, and Matos and substituted his own, unqualified medical opinion in place of the evidence provided by these physicians.  Claimant says that the medical evidence provided by these physicians established that she is at least disabled from performing her past secretarial work due to thoracic outlet syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, left arm numbness, and pain.  Claimant further argues that the ALJ erred in concluding that she has the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform her past relevant work absent an RFC assessment by a physician.  Finally, claimant contends that the ALJ failed to give appropriate consideration to her complaints of disabling pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must affirm the Secretary's decision if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.   Rodriguez v.  Secretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981).  \"Claimant is not entitled to disability benefits unless [s]he can demonstrate that h[er] disability existed prior to the expiration of h[er] insured status.\"  Cruz Rivera v.  Secretary of Health and Human Services, 818 F.2d 96, 97 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1042 (1987).  It is not sufficient for a claimant to establish that her impairment had its roots before the date that her insured status expired.  Rather, the claimant must show that her impairment(s) reached a disabling level of severity by that date.  See, e.g., Deblois v.  Secretary of Health and Human Services, 686 F.2d 76, 79 (1st Cir. 1982);   Tremblay v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 676 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 1982).  This does not mean, however, that medical evidence from the post-insured period is always wholly irrelevant.  Medical evidence generated after a claimant's insured status expires may be considered for what light (if any) it sheds on the question whether claimant's impairment(s) reached disabling severity before claimant's insured status expired.   See, e.g., Smith v. Bowen, 849 F.2d 1222, 1225 (9th Cir. 1988);   Basinger v. Heckler, 725 F.2d 1166, 1169 (8th Cir. 1984)(collecting cases);   Gonzalez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 757 F. Supp. 130, 134 (D.P.R. 1991);   Alcaide v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 601 F. Supp. 669, 672-73 (D.P.R. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we think claimant overstates the strength of the evidence from Drs. Jordan, Tamayo, and Matos, we are troubled by the ALJ's finding that claimant did not present objective clinical findings to sustain her allegations of left arm numbness until after her insured status expired in 1989.  Dr. Jordan recorded that claimant was experiencing left arm numbness in connection with cervical spasm in August 1988.  (Tr. 127).  And while claimant was not prescribed strong analgesics through December 31 1989, Dr. Jordan did prescribe Decadron, an anti-inflammatory medication, in August 1988.  (Tr. 126).  The record as a whole suggests that claimant suffered from symptoms associated with thoracic outlet syndrome both before and after her insured status expired.  Arguably, the ALJ should have considered this condition in evaluating claimant's RFC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we cannot say that the ALJ erred in discounting the evidence from the post-insured period.  The record discloses that for at least three of the five years after the alleged date of onset (i.e., 1985, 1986, and 1987), claimant sought no medical treatment.  A gap in the medical evidence may itself be evidence that claimant's condition was not as dire as alleged.   See Irlanda Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 955 F.2d 765, 769 (1st Cir. 1991)(gaps in record supported conclusion that claimant's pain was not as intense as alleged).  Apart from one 1988 complaint of numbness and cervical spasm, which was treated with Decadron, there is no evidence that claimant's condition was particularly troubling during the insured period that remained after her surgery, much less disabling.  We think that a single complaint of numbness and spasm does not undermine the ALJ's conclusion that claimant retained the RFC to perform sedentary work during the insured period.   See Gordils v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 921 F.2d 327, 329 (1st Cir. 1990)(\"if the only medical findings in the record suggest that a claimant exhibited little in the way of physical impairments, but nowhere in the record did any physician state in functional terms that the claimant had the exertional capacity to meet the requirements of sedentary work, the ALJ would be permitted to reach that functional conclusion himself\").  This conclusion is further supported by the ALJ's finding that there is no evidence of significant restrictions in claimant's daily activities and social functioning during the insured period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the ALJ did not stop there, however, and went on to conclude that claimant retained the RFC to perform her past light work as a secretary.  We expressly limited our holding in Gordils to sedentary work, noting that the evidence that the claimant had a \"weaker back\" was not sufficient to support the conclusion that the claimant could do the more physically demanding light work.  See 921 F.2d at 329.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Claimant argues that the ALJ erred by concluding that claimant could perform light work without an RFC from a physician.  We have repeatedly admonished that ALJs generally are not qualified to assess RFC based on a bare medical record.  See,  e.g., Gordils, 921 F.2d at 329;   Rivera-Torres v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 837 F.2d 4, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1988).  And while this principle does not preclude ALJs from rendering \"common sense judgments about functional capacity\" that do not overstep the bounds of a lay person's competence,  Gordils, 921 F.2d at 329, where significant exertional limitations are present, an exertional RFC is required.   See Perez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 958 F.2d 445, 446-47 (1st Cir. 1991).  However, in order to trigger this requirement, the claimant must first put her RFC in issue.  Thus, in Santiago v.  Secretary of Health and Human Services, 944 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1992), we upheld an ALJ's determination that a claimant retained the RFC to perform her past, light work as a sewing machine operator absent an expert's RFC because the record demonstrated that claimant had \"only relatively mild mental and physical impairments\" and claimant never clarified the particular respects in which her impairments prevented her from performing her past work.  We emphasized that to meet the burden of proof at step 4, a claimant must produce evidence of the physical and mental demands of her prior work and describe how her impairment(s) precluded the performance of that work \"in the relevant period.\"   Id. at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, while the claimant described both her duties and her present impairments, neither her testimony nor the medical evidence explained how her impairments precluded the performance of work-related tasks during the insured period.  Rather, the record as a whole suggests that claimant recovered from her surgery and did not seek treatment for the three years that ensued (1985, 1986, and 1987).  And while claimant sought treatment again in 1988, there was no evidence as to the frequency or duration of her symptoms during the relevant period, nor did claimant explain how her symptoms precluded the performance of the various tasks associated with her past work during that time.  Thus, where claimant failed to focus her proof on the relevant insured period, and the medical evidence from that time does not suggest that claimant continuously suffered from disabling symptoms, we think the ALJ supportably concluded that claimant retained the RFC to perform her past work as a secretary notwithstanding the absence of a physician's RFC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, claimant argues that the ALJ did not give sufficient weight to her complaints of disabling pain.  Once again, this argument fails because the claimant did not specify how her pain limited her functions during the insured period.  The ALJ supportably found that claimant was not prescribed strong analgesics during the insured period (indeed, we cannot discern that claimant was prescribed any analgesics during this time).  Claimant initially reported that she could drive, shop, cook, tend flowers, and maintain social contacts.

(Tr. 132).  During the course of claimant's 1984 hospitalization claimant also underwent testing for chest pain and other problems.

Moreover, the ALJ also found that claimant has the RFC \"to perform work related activities except for work involving lifting and carrying over 10 pounds frequently and 20 pounds occasionally.\"  (Tr. 16).

(Tr. 24, 33, 39).  But it is clear that claimant was speaking of her condition at the present, and did not focus on her condition between 1985 and 1989.  As it was claimant's burden to prove that she was disabled before her insured status expired, claimant was required to adduce evidence on her condition during that period.  And, in contrast to claimant's testimony, the evidence in her 1990 disability report, which was prepared only ten months after claimant's insured status expired, indicated that claimant could drive, cook, do \"some\" cleaning and shopping, and take care of flowers.

Claimant alleged that she had been disabled from work since December 15, 1985 due to the surgical removal of two left ribs, left arm numbness and pain and back pains.  (Tr. 61).  Claimant's insured status expired on December 31, 1989.  Claimant graduated from high school and received additional training as a secretary around 1961.  (Tr.65) Between 1963 and 1985, she worked as a secretary, receptionist, and office clerk at various companies in her native Puerto Rico.  (Tr. 66).  Her responsibilities included typing letters, filing, answering the telephone, using calculators, taking orders from customers, and other office procedures.  (Tr. 33, 66).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical evidence discloses that claimant began experiencing left wrist pain with paresthesias of the left upper extremity in December, 1983.  (Tr. 86).  In early 1984, claimant was evaluated by Dr. Jose Lozada-Roman for recurrent anterior chest pain and numbness of the left arm.  (Tr. 136).  X-rays of claimant's cervical spine taken on February 6, 1984 disclosed the presence of a left cervical rib and osteophytosis (bony growths) of the mid-dorsal vertebrae.  (Tr. 85).  Vascular studies from that period further revealed that claimant experienced severe compression of the sub-clavian artery with her arms overhead and mild vasospastic flow with the arms at rest.  (Tr. 83-84).  Dr. Lozada-Roman opined that claimant's evaluation, which included a positive Adson's test, \"was strongly suggestive of thoracic outlet syndrome.\"  (Tr. 136).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He referred claimant to a vascular surgeon, Dr. Raul Garcia-Rinaldi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 25, 1984, claimant was admitted to the Houston, Texas Memorial Hospital under the care of Dr. Garcia-Rinaldi.  She again reported that in December 1983 she experienced the onset of left wrist pain that radiated to her elbow and associated numbness of the left hand.  Her condition was aggravated by physical activity.  (Tr. 106).  She also complained of left-sided neck and shoulder pain with paresthesias of the left upper extremity, tachycardia, light headedness, palpitations, diaphoresis, neck, facial, and anterior chest flushing, diarrhea, a sensation that there was a lump in her throat, and generalized anxiety.  Dr. Garcia- Rinaldi found no increase of left wrist pain upon sustained hyperextension of the wrist and that the distal pulses were symmetrical at rest.  (Tr. 107).  His initial impression was that claimant suffered from a left cervical rib, rule out thoracic outlet syndrome, and generalized anxiety with a history of acute anxiety attacks.  (Tr. 107.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 1984, Dr. William Fleming evaluated claimant as a consultant to Dr. Garcia-Rinaldi.  Dr. Fleming found that claimant exhibited a full range of motion of the cervical spine, although she complained of a popping sensation when she turned her neck.  Tinel's sign was positive at both wrists, the left greater than the right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  There was moderate weakness of the left abductor pollicis brevis muscle (i.e., the muscle between the wrist and the first joint of the thumb) and decreased sensation in the first three fingers of the left arm.  Dr. Fleming's impression was that claimant had left median neuropathy of the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Other possible conditions to be ruled out were thoracic outlet syndrome, left brachial plexopathy, and cervical radiculopathy.  (Tr. 103).  Dr. Fleming recommended an electromyogram, nerve conduction studies, and x-rays of both wrists and the cervical spine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A March 27, 1984 electromyogram was normal.  (Tr. 86).  In addition, cervical spine films and x-rays of both wrists were within normal limits except for the presence of the left cervical rib that had been previously found.  (Tr. 86).  The record suggests that no nerve conduction studies were done in 1984.  On March 29, 1984, Dr. Garcia-Rinaldi diagnosed claimant to be suffering from thoracic outlet syndrome due to compression of the subclavian arteries caused by the left cervical and first ribs.  (Tr. 93).  He performed a transaxillary resection of these ribs.  His operative report indicates that when the rib sections were removed, \"the subclavian artery and its veins were released\" and \"[e]xcellent distal pulsations were obtained in all positions.\"  (Tr. 93).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant was discharged from the hospital on April 3, 1984.  She returned to work after the surgery and continued to work until December 1985.  Claimant alleges that while she experienced some improvement following the surgery, she continued to experience arm pain and numbness that eventually adversely affected her work performance and caused her to be fired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Claimant has not worked since the alleged onset of her disability on December 15, 1985.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no medical records from 1985, 1986, or 1987.  Between August 12, 1988 and April 1991, Dr. Tomas Jordan saw claimant five times per year for various conditions.  While Dr. Jordan's office records are largely illegible, they indicate that claimant had a history of thoracic outlet syndrome that was treated with the surgical removal of a cervical rib.  (Tr. 108).  Dr. Jordan treated claimant for numbness of the left arm, cervical spasm and hematuria during August and September 1988.  He prescribed Decadron, an anti-inflammatory drug, and other medications.  (Tr. 124-27).  X-rays from that time disclosed mild straightening of the cervical spine and mild osteophytes of the thoracic spine.  (Tr. 131).  Dr. Jordan indicated that claimant's impairments included carpal tunnel syndrome, cervical myositis, hiatal hernia, microhematuria, gastritis, and irritable colon syndrome.  (Tr. 112).  However, he did not specify when she suffered from symptoms associated with these conditions, nor did he state that any of these conditions were disabling either during or after the insured period.  Dr. Jordan referred claimant to a physiatrist for her thoracic outlet syndrome and prescribed medications, physical therapy, and diet for her other symptoms.  (Tr. 108, 112).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1990, claimant was examined by Dr. Percival Tamayo, a Florida internist and SSA consultant.  At that time claimant reported that she could still do some housework and lift weights less than ten pounds.  Physical examination disclosed that claimant's neck was supple and that claimant exhibited no pain on hyperextension or rotation.  The back showed no significant paravertebral muscle spasm and no spine deformity.  Her lower extremities were normal.  There was no significant reduction in the range of motion in claimant's cervical or lumbar spine, and no pain was produced during the range of motion testing.  Neurological examination was grossly unremarkable.  Palpation of the chest wall elicited tenderness over the costochondral junction at the second and third rib levels, especially on the left side.  Dr. Tamayo concluded that claimant suffered from non-cardiac chest pain consistent with costochondritis (an inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the sternum) and that her residual left arm discomfort may be secondary to her previous thoracic outlet syndrome.  No other significant abnormalities were noted.  (Tr. 133-34).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Lozada-Roman also submitted a report dated 12/20/90.  In addition to the aforementioned history, he stated that claimant was then experiencing \"some discomfort\" in the left arm and difficulty writing and lifting objects.  He recommended that she again see a vascular surgeon and have a neurological evaluation.  (Tr. 136).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 1991, claimant's initial application was denied.  She immediately filed a request for reconsideration which was also denied.  Claimant filed a request for a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) and submitted additional medical evidence.  On April 9, 1991, claimant saw Dr. Victor Gonzalez, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation.  (Tr. 137-38).  His records are also largely illegible.  Nevertheless, Dr. Gonzalez reported that claimant was experiencing pain in her chest and elbows in 1991, as well as numbness of both arms, more so on the left.  Claimant also alleged that she had pain in her left hip.  Physical examination disclosed tenderness on palpation of the cervical resection area.  A 4/10/91 note suggests that claimant's symptoms were consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome and thoracic outlet syndrome.  (Tr. 138).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An April 17, 1991 electromyogram of claimant's upper limbs was normal.  (Tr. 113).  However, nerve conduction studies from that date showed early signs of carpal tunnel syndrome and entrapment neuropathy of the ulnar nerve at Guyon's canal.  April 1991 x-rays of claimant's lumbar spine were normal.  (Tr. 151-53).  On May 24, 1991, claimant had another vascular study.  This disclosed mild compression of the right subclavian artery with the arm to side and arm to back maneuvers and severe compression with the arms overhead.  The left subclavian artery also exhibited mild compression with the arms overhead.  Claimant's circulation was normal with her arms at rest, although she experienced mild vasospastic flow in both hands.  Dr. Ivette Matos Serrano, a neurologist, began treating claimant around 1991.  (Tr. 28).  On June 20, 1991, one and one-half years after claimant's insured status expired, Dr. Matos reported that claimant was experiencing numbness in the posterior part of the head, frequent headaches, paresthesias, cramps of both upper extremities, and \"an electric-like sensation along the posterior aspect of the left upper extremity down to the fingers[.]\"  The remainder of her report suggests that claimant's condition was considerably more dire than that described by Dr. Tamayo, the SSA's consultant.  For example, Dr. Matos indicated that claimant had muscle spasms in her cervical, paravertebral, and trapezius muscles, that her range of motion testing revealed significant limitations and pain, and that claimant exhibited diminished sensation in her left arm and leg and \"slight weakness\" of both handgrips.  Based on her examination and the 1991 vascular and nerve conduction studies, Dr. Matos diagnosed claimant to be suffering from severe bilateral thoracic outlet syndrome, chronic cervical syndrome, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral entrapment neuropathy of the ulnar nerves, and chronic lumbar syndrome with clinical signs and symptoms suggesting radicular involvement.  She concluded that claimant had suffered from bilateral thoracic outlet syndrome since 1983, and that while she experienced some improvement on her left side following surgery in 1984, her condition became progressively aggravated.  Dr. Matos opined that it was understandable for claimant's symptoms to remain following surgery as in many patients symptoms do recur.  She advised that claimant would continue to need treatment for an indefinite time and that her labor prognosis was extremely poor.  However, Dr. Matos did not express an opinion on whether claimant was disabled during the insured period.  (Tr. 142-47).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant and her attorney appeared for a hearing before an ALJ on August 1, 1991.  Claimant testified that she could no longer work as a result of her 1984 operation and continuing pain and numbness.  She explained that after her operation, her \"ability to work decreased\" and she was fired as a result.  (Tr. 25).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Claimant asserted that she did not go back to work because she felt \"ill\" and \"demoralized\", noting that she experienced \"lots of pains in the neck, muscular spasms which continued after the operation[, and her] arms got numb.\"  (Tr. 26).  While claimant acknowledged that she experienced some improvement after the operation, pains and numbness of both arms continued.  Claimant testified that she is incapacitated because of the pain she constantly feels.  (Tr. 26, 32.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 27, 1991, the ALJ issued a decision denying claimant's application for benefits.  The ALJ specifically found that during the relevant insured period, claimant suffered from severe cervical myositis and status post trans- axillary resection of her left cervical and first ribs.  Although these conditions did not meet or equal the SSA's listings of impairments, the ALJ found that they imposed significant limitations on claimant's ability to lift and carry.  With respect to claimant's complaints of pain and numbness, the ALJ found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>... the claimant's neck pain is sustained as being secondary to her cervical myositis evidenced by mild straightening of the cervical spine.  However, subsequent to the claimant's surgery on March 29, 1984, she did not present objective clinical findings in which to sustain her allegations of chest pain or left arm numbness until subsequent to the critical period in issue.  Through December 31, 1989, the claimant was not prescribed strong analgesics and there is no evidence of significant restrictions in her daily activities and social functioning suggestive of her inability to perform within all exertional levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these findings, the ALJ concluded that claimant retained the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work through December 31, 1989.  (Tr. 15, 16).  He then went on to conclude that claimant's impairments did not disable her from performing her past light work as a secretary.  (Tr. 15, 16).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Consequently, the ALJ denied benefits at step four of the sequential evaluation process.   See Goodermote v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409370\"><a href=\"/opinion/409370/william-edward-goodermote-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1982).  The Appeals Council denied review, thus rendering the ALJ's decision final.  Claimant sought judicial review pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 405(g).  The district court summarily affirmed the Secretary.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, claimant argues that the ALJ's decision is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole because the ALJ ignored the uncontroverted evidence of disability provided by Drs. Jordan, Tamayo, and Matos and substituted his own, unqualified medical opinion in place of the evidence provided by these physicians.  Claimant says that the medical evidence provided by these physicians established that she is at least disabled from performing her past secretarial work due to thoracic outlet syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, left arm numbness, and pain.  Claimant further argues that the ALJ erred in concluding that she has the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform her past relevant work absent an RFC assessment by a physician.  Finally, claimant contends that the ALJ failed to give appropriate consideration to her complaints of disabling pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must affirm the Secretary's decision if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.

It is not sufficient for a claimant to establish that her impairment had its roots before the date that her insured status expired.  Rather, the claimant must show that her impairment(s) reached a disabling level of severity by that date.  See, e.g., Deblois v.  Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"407758\"><a href=\"/opinion/407758/maurice-deblois-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">686</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir. 1982);   Tremblay v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402520\"><a href=\"/opinion/402520/lucienne-j-tremblay-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir. 1982).  This does not mean, however, that medical evidence from the post-insured period is always wholly irrelevant.  Medical evidence generated after a claimant's insured status expires may be considered for what light (if any) it sheds on the question whether claimant's impairment(s) reached disabling severity before claimant's insured status expired.   See, e.g., Smith v. Bowen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507854\"><a href=\"/opinion/507854/22-socsecrepser-146-unemplinsrep-cch-14014a-wyatt-q-smith-v-otis/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1222</span></a></span>, 1225 (9th Cir. 1988);   Basinger v.

Jordan, Tamayo, and Matos, we are troubled by the ALJ's finding that claimant did not present objective clinical findings to sustain her allegations of left arm numbness until after her insured status expired in 1989.  Dr. Jordan recorded that claimant was experiencing left arm numbness in connection with cervical spasm in August 1988.  (Tr. 127).  And while claimant was not prescribed strong analgesics through December 31 1989, Dr. Jordan did prescribe Decadron, an anti-inflammatory medication, in August 1988.  (Tr. 126).  The record as a whole suggests that claimant suffered from symptoms associated with thoracic outlet syndrome both before and after her insured status expired.  Arguably, the ALJ should have considered this condition in evaluating claimant's RFC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we cannot say that the ALJ erred in discounting the evidence from the post-insured period.  The record discloses that for at least three of the five years after the alleged date of onset (i.e., 1985, 1986, and 1987), claimant sought no medical treatment.  A gap in the medical evidence may itself be evidence that claimant's condition was not as dire as alleged.   See Irlanda Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577108\"><a href=\"/opinion/577108/victor-j-irlanda-ortiz-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 769 (1st Cir. 1991)(gaps in record supported conclusion that claimant's pain was not as intense as alleged).  Apart from one 1988 complaint of numbness and cervical spasm, which was treated with Decadron, there is no evidence that claimant's condition was particularly troubling during the insured period that remained after her surgery, much less disabling.  We think that a single complaint of numbness and spasm does not undermine the ALJ's conclusion that claimant retained the RFC to perform sedentary work during the insured period.   See Gordils v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553161\"><a href=\"/opinion/553161/32-socsecrepser-101-unemplinsrep-cch-15802a-jose-l-gordils-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 329 (1st Cir. 1990)(\"if the only medical findings in the record suggest that a claimant exhibited little in the way of physical impairments, but nowhere in the record did any physician state in functional terms that the claimant had the exertional capacity to meet the requirements of sedentary work, the ALJ would be permitted to reach that functional conclusion himself\").  This conclusion is further supported by the ALJ's finding that there is no evidence of significant restrictions in claimant's daily activities and social functioning during the insured period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the ALJ did not stop there, however, and went on to conclude that claimant retained the RFC to perform her past light work as a secretary.  We expressly limited our holding in Gordils to sedentary work, noting that the evidence that the claimant had a \"weaker back\" was not sufficient to support the conclusion that the claimant could do the more physically demanding light work.  See 921 F.2d at 329.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Claimant argues that the ALJ erred by concluding that claimant could perform light work without an RFC from a physician.  We have repeatedly admonished that ALJs generally are not qualified to assess RFC based on a bare medical record.  See,  e.g., Gordils, 921 F.2d at 329;   Rivera-Torres v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500039\"><a href=\"/opinion/500039/20-socsecrepser-260-unemplinsrep-cch-17887-juan-rivera-torres-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1988).  And while this principle does not preclude ALJs from rendering \"common sense judgments about functional capacity\" that do not overstep the bounds of a lay person's competence,  Gordils, 921 F.2d at 329, where significant exertional limitations are present, an exertional RFC is required.   See Perez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579197\"><a href=\"/opinion/579197/ramonita-cintron-perez-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span>, 446-47 (1st Cir. 1991).  However, in order to trigger this requirement, the claimant must first put her RFC in issue.  Thus, in Santiago v.  Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1992), we upheld an ALJ's determination that a claimant retained the RFC to perform her past, light work as a sewing machine operator absent an expert's RFC because the record demonstrated that claimant had \"only relatively mild mental and physical impairments\" and claimant never clarified the particular respects in which her impairments prevented her from performing her past work.  We emphasized that to meet the burden of proof at step 4, a claimant must produce evidence of the physical and mental demands of her prior work and describe how her impairment(s) precluded the performance of that work \"in the relevant period.\"   Id. at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, while the claimant described both her duties and her present impairments, neither her testimony nor the medical evidence explained how her impairments precluded the performance of work-related tasks during the insured period.  Rather, the record as a whole suggests that claimant recovered from her surgery and did not seek treatment for the three years that ensued (1985, 1986, and 1987).  And while claimant sought treatment again in 1988, there was no evidence as to the frequency or duration of her symptoms during the relevant period, nor did claimant explain how her symptoms precluded the performance of the various tasks associated with her past work during that time.  Thus, where claimant failed to focus her proof on the relevant insured period, and the medical evidence from that time does not suggest that claimant continuously suffered from disabling symptoms, we think the ALJ supportably concluded that claimant retained the RFC to perform her past work as a secretary notwithstanding the absence of a physician's RFC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, claimant argues that the ALJ did not give sufficient weight to her complaints of disabling pain.  Once again, this argument fails because the claimant did not specify how her pain limited her functions during the insured period.  The ALJ supportably found that claimant was not prescribed strong analgesics during the insured period (indeed, we cannot discern that claimant was prescribed any analgesics during this time).  Claimant initially reported that she could drive, shop, cook, tend flowers, and maintain social contacts.  Thus, the record does not suggest that claimant's pain was disabling during the relevant period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Claimant's disability report indicated that her past work required her to perform the light exertional tasks of lifting weights of up to 10 pounds frequently and 20 pounds occasionally, sitting for four hours and walking and standing, respectively, for two hours each.

There he stated that the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome resulting from a left cervical rib \"was quite clear\" and that, to the best of his knowledge, claimant had satisfactory results following the March 1984 surgery.  (Tr. 132).  During the course of claimant's 1984 hospitalization claimant also underwent testing for chest pain and other problems.  She was found to have chronic esophagitis and bladder polyps, which were removed.

(Tr. 61).  Moreover, Dr. Matos reported that claimant was dismissed from her job because of a nervous condition, not because of her physical complaints.

(Tr. 26).  She testified that she experienced strong neck and back pain which is only temporarily relieved with medication and that she can only sit and stand for 10 minutes at a time.

(Tr. 14).  As noted above at n. 1, these exertional requirements are consistent with light work.  Moreover, the ALJ also found that claimant has the RFC \"to perform work related activities except for work involving lifting and carrying over 10 pounds frequently and 20 pounds occasionally.\"  (Tr. 16).  Implicit in this statement is the assertion that claimant can lift up to 10 pounds frequently and 20 pounds occasionally</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> To be sure, claimant testified that she had not driven in 3 or 4 years, that her daughter did most of the housework, and that while she goes to church, she spends most of her time lying down due to her various ailments.  (Tr. 24, 33, 39).  But it is clear that claimant was speaking of her condition at the present, and did not focus on her condition between 1985 and 1989.  As it was claimant's burden to prove that she was disabled before her insured status expired, claimant was required to adduce evidence on her condition during that period.  And, in contrast to claimant's testimony, the evidence in her 1990 disability report, which was prepared only ten months after claimant's insured status expired, indicated that claimant could drive, cook, do \"some\" cleaning and shopping, and take care of flowers.  (Tr. 64).  Given the gap in the medical evidence from the insured period, this supports the ALJ's conclusion that the sedentary base was intact during that time</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> We note that in Gordils, a nonexamining physician had indicated that claimant could do light work.
