In its complaint, Northeast\n                              \n\nDoran, Inc. (\"Doran\") alleged that Key Bank of Maine (\"Key\"),\n\nmortgagee and subsequent vendor of the property at issue, was\n\nliable   for   clean-up   costs   under   the   Comprehensive\n\nEnvironmental  Response,   Compensation  and   Liability  Act\n\n(\"CERCLA\"),  as  amended  by  the  Superfund  Amendments  and\n\nReauthorization Act  of 1986  (\"SARA\").   The district  court\n\ndismissed  the  complaint  for  failure  to  state  a  claim,\n\nreasoning that Key's knowledge of potential contamination did\n\nnot render it liable under CERCLA.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          In December 1989, Ed Harmon &amp; Sons, Inc. (\"Harmon\")\n\npurchased property  located at the Skowhegan  Industrial Park\n\nin  Skowhegan,  Maine  (\"the property\").    The  purchase was\n\nfinanced with  a mortgage from  Key Bank.   In June  of 1990,\n\nDoran leased the property from Harmon.  \n\n          In July of  1991, with  Harmon unable  to meet  its\n\nmortgage payments, Key Bank sought and received a Judgment of\n\nForeclosure and Order of Sale  from the Superior Court of the\n\nState of Maine  and made plans to  auction the property.   On\n\nOctober  21, 1991,  Key hired  an  independent consultant  to\n\nconduct a Maine Superlien Site  Assessment (\"the assessment\")\n\nof  the property.   Two  weeks  later, on  November 7,  1991,\n\nwithout  having received the  results of the  assessment, Key\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\ncompleted its  disclosure statement  for use  in the  auction\n\nprospectus.   Key  stated in  that  document that  it had  no\n\nknowledge of any hazardous materials on the property.\n\n          On November 18,  1991, Key received the  results of\n\nthe   assessment,   which    showed   potential   groundwater\n\ncontamination on the property.  Key took no steps to make the\n\nresults of  the  assessment known  to  bidders prior  to  the\n\nauction.\n\n          At the  auction on  November 21,  1991, Doran,  who\n\nremained in possession  of the property, entered  the highest\n\nbid  and  signed  a  purchase  and  sale  agreement  for  the\n\nproperty.    When Doran  sought  financing from  Key  for its\n\npurchase of the  property, Key refused, citing  for the first\n\ntime the result of the assessment.  Doran, apparently able to\n\nobtain other financing,  purchased the property from  Key via\n\nquitclaim deed on December 17, 1991.\n\n          After purchasing  the property, Doran  notified the\n\nMaine  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (\"DEP\")  of\n\npotential  contamination on the property.  DEP assessed costs\n\nagainst  Doran, the  \"owner\" of  the  property under  CERCLA.\n\nDoran brought  an action in the United  States District Court\n\nfor the  District of  Maine, seeking  a declaratory  judgment\n\nthat  Key was  liable  for clean-up  costs  on the  property.\n\nAmong other things,  Doran argued that Key,  unlike similarly\n\nsituated  secured creditors,  was  not entitled  to  CERCLA's\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n\"security  interest holder\"  exemption and  that  a right  of\n\naction   existed   due  to   Key's  knowledge   of  potential\n\ncontamination prior to and at the time of sale.  The district\n\ncourt  dismissed Doran's  complaint for  failure  to state  a\n\nclaim upon  which relief could  be granted, finding  that Key\n\nwas  not  a  liable  party  under  CERCLA  and  its  relevant\n\namendments.  We affirm.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          \"We  review  a  Rule  12(b)(6)  dismissal de  novo,\n                                                            \n\ncrediting  all allegations in  the complaint and  drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences favorable  to the plaintiff.\"   Heno v.\n                                                          \n\nFDIC, 996 F.2d 429,  430 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Scheuer v.\n                                                          \n\nRhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974).  \n      \n\n          Our  analysis  begins with  CERCLA's  definition of\n\nliable parties.  CERCLA, 42  U.S.C.   9607(a), provides  that\n\nliability for  environmental  clean-up  shall  attach,  inter\n                                                             \n\nalia, to:\n    \n\n          (1) the owner and operator of a vessel or\n          a facility,\n\n          (2)  any  person  who  at  the   time  of\n          disposal of any hazardous substance owned\n          or operated  any facility  at which  such\n          hazardous substances were disposed of . .\n          . .\n\n          While   Key,   having   obtained  a   judgment   of\n\nforeclosure on the property, might  appear at first glance to\n\nbe an \"owner\"  or \"operator\" of the property  for purposes of\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nsection  9607(a),  CERCLA's   definition  provisions  clearly\n\ndictate otherwise.  Under 42  U.S.C.   9601(20)(A), the terms\n\n\"owner\" or \"operator\" \"do not include a person, who,  without\n\nparticipating  in the  management of  a  vessel or  facility,\n\nholds  indicia of ownership primarily to protect his security\n\ninterest in the  vessel or facility.\"  As  we recently stated\n\nin  Waterville Indus., Inc.  v. Finance  Auth. of  Maine, 984\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 549, 552 (1st Cir.  1993), \"the purpose of the statutory\n\nexception, apparent from its language  and statutory context,\n\nis to shield from liability those `owners' who are in essence\n\nlenders holding  title to  the property  as security  for the\n\ndebt.\"   Moreover,  \"[s]o  long  as  the  [security  interest\n\nholder] makes a reasonably prompt  effort to divest itself of\n\nits unwelcome  ownership, we  think continued  coverage under\n\nthe exception serves its basic  policy:  to protect bona fide\n\nlenders and to avoid imposing liability on owners who are not\n\nin fact  seeking to  profit from  the investment  opportunity\n\nnormally presented by prolonged ownership.\"  Id. at 553.\n                                                \n\n          Doran  does not allege, nor could it on the record,\n\nthat Key's effort  to divest itself of title  to the property\n\nwas  anything less  than  \"reasonably  prompt.\"   Id.    More\n                                                     \n\nimportantly, in support  of its allegation that  Key held the\n\nproperty  for  a  purpose  other  than  as  security for  its\n                                      \n\nmortgage  on the property, Doran  cites only the existence of\n\nthe  assessment,  and  Key's  withholding  of  its   results.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nStanding  alone, however, the existence of a site assessment,\n\neven   one   which   reveals   the  existence   of   possible\n\nenvironmental  contamination and which  is concealed from the\n\neventual purchaser, is  insufficient to remove a  holder from\n\nthe   \"security  interest   holder\"   exception  in   section\n\n9601(20)(A).  See Waterville Indus., 984 F.2d at 554 (holding\n                                   \n\nthat   security   interest   holder  exception   in   section\n\n9601(20)(A) applied  despite fact  that security  holder sold\n\nthe property \"without making full disclosure of the hazardous\n\nwastes or  of  notices of  violation  sent to  [the  security\n\ninterest holder]\"); see also United  States v. McLamb, 5 F.3d\n                                                     \n\n69, 70-74 (4th  Cir. 1993) (similar, where  security interest\n\nholder \"learned of the previous oil spill at [property] after\n\nthe  foreclosure  but  prior   to  selling  the  property\").1\n\nAccordingly, Doran's  complaint fails  to allege  any set  of\n\nfacts under which Key could be liable under CERCLA.\n\n          Doran  also  argues  that  the  security   interest\n\nexception  should  not   apply  in  view   of  42  U.S.C.    \n\n                    \n\n1.  Recent  regulations  promulgated  by  the  United  States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), though prospective and\nnot  dispositive  in  the instant  case,  also  indicate that\nsecurity interest holders do not compromise their eligibility\nfor section  9601(20)(A) status  by conducting  environmental\naudits.   See  40  C.F.R.  300.1100;  Final  Rule  on  Lender\n             \nLiability Under CERCLA, 57 Fed. Reg. 18,344, 18,353 (Apr. 29,\n1992).   See also  McLamb, 5  F.3d at  73  &amp; n.8;  Waterville\n                                                             \nIndus., 984 F.2d at 553 &amp; n.6.\n      \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n9601(35)(C),2  which   holds  liable  those   defendants  who\n\n\"owned\" and then transferred property with \"actual knowledge\"\n\nof contamination.  As noted  above, however, Key was never an\n\n\"owner\" as that term is defined by CERCLA.  See supra  at pp.\n                                                     \n\n4-6.   Nor do we find  any support for Doran's  argument that\n\nsection 9601(35)(C)  somehow renders liable parties who would\n\notherwise fall  under the security interest  holder exception\n\nof  section  9601(20)(A).3    Thus,  we  find  no  means  for\n\napplying section 9601(35)(C) to Key.\n\n                    \n\n2.  Section 9601(35) provides:\n\n          Nothing in  this paragraph or  in section\n          9607(b)(3) of  this title  shall diminish\n          the liability  of any  previous owner  or\n          operator  of  such   facility  who  would\n          otherwise be  liable under  this chapter.\n          Notwithstanding  this  paragraph,  if the\n          defendant  obtained  actual  knowledge of\n          the  release or  threatened release  of a\n          hazardous substance at such facility when\n          the defendant owned the real property and\n          then  subsequently transferred  ownership\n          of the property to another person without\n          disclosing such knowledge, such defendant\n          shall be treated  as liable under section\n          9607(a)(1) of this  title and no  defense\n          under  section 9607(b)(3)  of this  title\n          shall be available to such defendant.\n\n3.  Rather,   the   cases  cited   by  Doran   apply  section\n9601(35)(C)  solely to  parties who  were  otherwise \"owners\"\nunder section 9607(a).  See, e.g.,  Westwood Pharmaceuticals,\n                                                             \nInc. v. National Fuel Gas  Distrib.

Corp. v. Strunk,\n                                                            \n1993 WL 157723,  *5 (E.D. Pa.)

In its complaint, Northeast\n                              \n\nDoran, Inc. (\"Doran\") alleged that Key Bank of Maine (\"Key\"),\n\nmortgagee and subsequent vendor of the property at issue, was\n\nliable   for   clean-up   costs   under   the   Comprehensive\n\nEnvironmental  Response,   Compensation  and   Liability  Act\n\n(\"CERCLA\"),  as  amended  by  the  Superfund  Amendments  and\n\nReauthorization Act  of 1986  (\"SARA\").   The district  court\n\ndismissed  the  complaint  for  failure  to  state  a  claim,\n\nreasoning that Key's knowledge of potential contamination did\n\nnot render it liable under CERCLA.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          In December 1989, Ed Harmon &amp; Sons, Inc. (\"Harmon\")\n\npurchased property  located at the Skowhegan  Industrial Park\n\nin  Skowhegan,  Maine  (\"the property\").    The  purchase was\n\nfinanced with  a mortgage from  Key Bank.   In June  of 1990,\n\nDoran leased the property from Harmon.  \n\n          In July of  1991, with  Harmon unable  to meet  its\n\nmortgage payments, Key Bank sought and received a Judgment of\n\nForeclosure and Order of Sale  from the Superior Court of the\n\nState of Maine  and made plans to  auction the property.   On\n\nOctober  21, 1991,  Key hired  an  independent consultant  to\n\nconduct a Maine Superlien Site  Assessment (\"the assessment\")\n\nof  the property.   Two  weeks  later, on  November 7,  1991,\n\nwithout  having received the  results of the  assessment, Key\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\ncompleted its  disclosure statement  for use  in the  auction\n\nprospectus.   Key  stated in  that  document that  it had  no\n\nknowledge of any hazardous materials on the property.\n\n          On November 18,  1991, Key received the  results of\n\nthe   assessment,   which    showed   potential   groundwater\n\ncontamination on the property.  Key took no steps to make the\n\nresults of  the  assessment known  to  bidders prior  to  the\n\nauction.\n\n          At the  auction on  November 21,  1991, Doran,  who\n\nremained in possession  of the property, entered  the highest\n\nbid  and  signed  a  purchase  and  sale  agreement  for  the\n\nproperty.    When Doran  sought  financing from  Key  for its\n\npurchase of the  property, Key refused, citing  for the first\n\ntime the result of the assessment.  Doran, apparently able to\n\nobtain other financing,  purchased the property from  Key via\n\nquitclaim deed on December 17, 1991.\n\n          After purchasing  the property, Doran  notified the\n\nMaine  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (\"DEP\")  of\n\npotential  contamination on the property.  DEP assessed costs\n\nagainst  Doran, the  \"owner\" of  the  property under  CERCLA.\n\nDoran brought  an action in the United  States District Court\n\nfor the  District of  Maine, seeking  a declaratory  judgment\n\nthat  Key was  liable  for clean-up  costs  on the  property.\n\nAmong other things,  Doran argued that Key,  unlike similarly\n\nsituated  secured creditors,  was  not entitled  to  CERCLA's\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n\"security  interest holder\"  exemption and  that  a right  of\n\naction   existed   due  to   Key's  knowledge   of  potential\n\ncontamination prior to and at the time of sale.  The district\n\ncourt  dismissed Doran's  complaint for  failure  to state  a\n\nclaim upon  which relief could  be granted, finding  that Key\n\nwas  not  a  liable  party  under  CERCLA  and  its  relevant\n\namendments.  We affirm.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          \"We  review  a  Rule  12(b)(6)  dismissal de  novo,\n                                                            \n\ncrediting  all allegations in  the complaint and  drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences favorable  to the plaintiff.\"   Heno v.\n                                                          \n\nFDIC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609731\"><a href=\"/opinion/609731/floyd-v-heno-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  430 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Scheuer v.\n                                                          \n\nRhodes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109009\"><a href=\"/opinion/109009/scheuer-v-rhodes/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236 (1974).  \n      \n\n          Our  analysis  begins with  CERCLA's  definition of\n\nliable parties.

Recent  regulations  promulgated  by  the  United  States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), though prospective and\nnot  dispositive  in  the instant  case,  also  indicate that\nsecurity interest holders do not compromise their eligibility\nfor section  9601(20)(A) status  by conducting  environmental\naudits.
