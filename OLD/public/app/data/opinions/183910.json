Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, Rosa\nEmilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division,\non brief for appellees Erickson, Marrero, and López.\n\n\n                           January 31, 2011\n\f              Per Curiam.     Plaintiff José E. Natal-Rosario (\"Natal\")\n\nappeals the district court's dismissal, under Rule 12(b)(6), of his\n\nclaims against the defendants, Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\n(\"FBI\") agents and Puerto Rico Police Department (\"PRPD\") officers.\n\nNatal alleges that the defendants (1) violated his Fourth Amendment\n\nrights   by    conducting     an    illegal     search   and    seizure    and    (2)\n\ninfringed     upon   his    Fifth   and    Fourteenth    Amendment    rights      to\n\nsubstantive and procedural due process.\n\n              Natal's Fourth Amendment argument has two components.\n\nFirst, Natal contends that when one FBI agent questioned him about\n\npersonal matters that were unrelated to the corruption charge about\n\nwhich he had agreed to be questioned, the agent was conducting an\n\nillegal search of Natal's private affairs.                This claim is waived\n\nbecause it was not raised below.            See, e.g., Martex Farms, S.E. v.\n\nEPA, 559 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n              Second, Natal argues that he was subjected to an illegal\n\nseizure because he felt compelled to agree to undergo a polygraph\n\nexamination and, once seated for the exam, felt he was not at\n\nliberty to leave.      Natal contends that he could not terminate the\n\ninterrogation or the encounter because he felt he needed to clear\n\nhis name, both to protect his reputation in general and to retain\n\nhis position as a deputized federal agent.                     We agree with the\n\ndistrict    court    that   Natal's    complaint     cannot      survive    a    Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion under the standard articulated in Ashcroft v.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fIqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949-50 (2009).          \"If an officer, by means\n\nof show of authority, even briefly restrains the liberty of a\n\ncitizen, we may conclude that a seizure has occurred,\" so long as\n\nwe are \"able to conclude that coercion, not voluntary compliance,\n\nmost accurately describes the encounter.\"          United States v. Smith,\n\n423 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 2005).            The facts pled here do not\n\n\"plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief,\" Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at\n\n1951, given this standard.         Here, even assuming that Natal's\n\ncomplaint allowed us to infer that he felt it was necessary to\n\nundergo the polygraph exam and answer the FBI agent's questions in\n\norder to maintain his position, we could not conclude that these\n\nfacts plausibly suggest that he was a victim of coercion.                  See\n\nFournier v. Reardon, 160 F.3d 754, 757 (1st Cir. 1998) (concluding,\n\nwhere plaintiff was handcuffed and put under \"house arrest\" as\n\npunishment    during   police    training   course,    that   even    though\n\nplaintiff    might   have   suffered   \"negative    consequences     for   his\n\ncontinued employment\" if he had not submitted to \"house arrest,\"\n\nthe punishment did not constitute a seizure because a reasonable\n\nobserver would conclude that plaintiff was free to end it).\n\n            Finally,   because   Natal    only   mentions   his   Fifth    and\n\nFourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process claims\n\nin a cursory manner on appeal, these arguments are deemed waived.\n\nSee United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f          For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court's\n\ndismissal of Natal's claims.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
