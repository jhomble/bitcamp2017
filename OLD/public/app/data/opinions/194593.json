In a  previous appeal  we\n                                   \n\naffirmed the convictions of Carlos Valencia-Lucena, Edwin Carpio-\n\nV lez,  and  Jos   Basti n-Cortijo  under  21  U.S.C.    846  for\n\nconspiring to  possess with intent to  distribute 137.2 kilograms\n\nof cocaine  and under 21  U.S.C.    963 for conspiring  to import\n\ninto the United States 137.2 kilograms of cocaine and we affirmed\n\nthe conviction  of Roberto  Laboy-Delgado on the  latter offense.\n\nHowever, we  vacated the sentences and  remanded for resentencing\n\nbecause  the district  court failed  to determine  the amount  of\n\ncocaine involved for  the purpose of sentencing.  In so doing, we\n\ndirected the district court to  conduct an evidentiary hearing on\n\nthat  issue. United States v. Valencia-Lucena,  925 F.2d 506 (1st\n                                             \n\nCir. 1991).\n\n          On  remand, the  parties stipulated  that  the evidence\n\nwould  be  the  same as  heard  at  trial.   The  district  court\n\ndetermined  that the amount of cocaine for the purpose of setting\n\nthe base  offense  level  was  137.2  kilograms  of  cocaine  and\n\nresentenced the defendants.  This appeal followed.\n\n          Appellants   claim   that  the   new   factual  finding\n\nconstitutes clear error.   They argue that the district  court is\n\nbound  by   its  prior   determination  that  the   evidence  was\n\ninsufficient and  unreliable to  sentence on  the basis of  137.2\n\nkilograms since  the  government offered  no new  evidence as  to\n\namount.  Appellants Basti n-Cortijo,  Laboy-Delgado, Carpio-V lez\n\nargue that the district court failed to give specific reasons for\n\nits finding  that  the amount  of  cocaine was  foreseeable,  and\n\n                               -3-\n\nfurther that  the evidence  was  insufficient to  support such  a\n\nfinding.   Finally, appellants  maintain that the  district court\n\nimproperly denied appellant Valencia-Lucena's document request at\n\nthe resentencing hearing, given  the court's new determination on\n\nthe  amount involved.   We affirm  the district  court's findings\n\nwith respect to the amount of cocaine used to  determine the base\n\noffense  level  as  well  as  its   denial  of  further  document\n\ndiscovery, but remand for specific findings on foreseeability.\n\n                      I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          As this appeal  concerns the district court's  findings\n\nupon  resentencing, we provide only  a summary of  the facts; our\n\nearlier  opinion recounts the history more  fully.  See Valencia-\n                                                                 \n\nLucena,  925 F.2d  506.   The four  appellants  participated with\n      \n\nothers  not part of  this appeal in  a scheme to  fly cocaine via\n\nprivate  aircraft  from Colombia,  South  America  to the  United\n\nStates through  the Virgin Islands.   Valencia-Lucena piloted the\n\naircraft from Puerto Rico to Colombia, returning with the cocaine\n\nto the drop point in the Virgin Islands.  Basti n-Cortijo was the\n\n\"kicker\"; he acted as the bombardier, allegedly dropping ten (10)\n\nigloo  coolers containing  twenty  (20) kilograms  of cocaine  to\n\nretrieval boats waiting below.   Carpio-V lez appeared at various\n\ntimes during  the conspiracy; he apparently  repaired some wiring\n\non one of the retrieval  boats and was alleged to have  owned the\n\ncocaine at one point.  Laboy-Delgado repaired mechanical problems\n\nwith  the boats.    The  government  foiled  the  plot  with  the\n\nassistance of a coconspirator turned confidential informant.\n\n                               -4-\n\n          Initially the government  indicted appellants based  on\n\nthe coconspirator,  confidential  informant's estimate  that  the\n\nobject  of the conspiracy was the importation of 200 kilograms of\n\ncocaine.  A  first superseding indictment  reduced the amount  to\n\n173.2 kilograms.  A second superseding indictment further reduced\n\nthe amount to 137.2 kilograms, the amount of cocaine recovered by\n\nthe  government some  days  after the  arrests.   At  trial,  the\n\ndistrict court  refused  to admit  into  evidence the  amount  of\n\ncocaine involved  in the conspiracy  because it viewed  the links\n\nbetween  the seized  cocaine  and  the  defendants as  weak,  and\n\nbelieved admission  of the evidence would  unfairly prejudice the\n\ndefendants.   The district court understood  that determining the\n\nactual  amount was  not necessary  to convict  on  the conspiracy\n\ncharges.   \n\n          The  district court  sentenced codefendant  Jos  Llad -\n\nOrtiz  first.1   The  district judge  subsequently clarified  the\n\nfindings  made  at  that hearing  in  its  opinion  and order  of\n\nDecember  28,  1989.    The district  court  then  applied  these\n\nfindings to appellants.  \n\n          It  was unclear to us how the district court arrived at\n\nhis initial  sentences.  When  challenged by the  government, the\n\ndistrict  court  adopted  the government's  position  that  137.2\n\nkilograms were to  be used  for calculation of  the base  offense\n\nlevel,  but  then  proceeded to  depart  downward  based  \"on the\n\ngovernment's failure to adequately prove that the 137.2 kilograms\n\n                    \n\n1  Llad -Ortiz is not part of this appeal.\n\n                               -5-\n\nof  cocaine,  found in  coolers  the government  seized,  was the\n\ncocaine the  defendants conspired to  import.\"  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nJos   Llad -Ortiz, Crim. No. 89-002,  slip op. at  5 (D.P.R. Dec.\n                 \n\n28, 1989).   The  district court  further supported the  downward\n\ndeparture  by stating  that the  government's case  agent falsely\n\ntestified  before the grand jury.   This latter reason was in the\n\nmanner of punishment.  The court concluded that \"[u]pon reviewing\n\nthe evidence at  trial, we do not find it  sufficient to sentence\n\nthe  defendants  according  to  a quantity  based  on  the  137.2\n\nfigure.\"  Id.\n             \n\n          Under   the   applicable   United   States   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  at the time of sentencing, the base offense level for\n\n137.2  kilograms of  cocaine was  36.   United  States Sentencing\n\nGuidelines,  Guidelines Manual,     2D1.4 &amp;  2D1.1(a)(3)  (Nov. 1\n                              \n\n1989) (Drug  Quantity Table).   The district court  increased the\n\ntotal offense  level of Valencia-Lucena  to 38  for his use  of a\n\nspecial skill  in piloting  the aircraft, U.S.S.G.    3B1.3,  and\n\nreduced  the offense levels  of Carpio-V lez, Basti n-Cortijo and\n\nLaboy-Delgado to  34 for  their  minor roles  in the  conspiracy,\n\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.2(b).  As a result of the downward  departure, the\n\ndistrict   court   sentenced   all  appellants   to   120  months\n\nimprisonment. \n\n          In the previous appeal we rejected the district court's\n\ndeparture  based   on  its  \"perceived  need   to  reprimand  the\n\ngovernment,\"  holding  that departure  is  not  warranted by  the\n\nconduct  of third  parties.   More important  to this  appeal, we\n\n                               -6-\n\nremanded for resentencing because the district court purported to\n\naccept  the government's  contention  that  137.2 kilograms  were\n\ninvolved for purposes of determining the base offense  level, but\n\nthen  departed  downward  because   it  deemed  the  evidence  an\n\ninsufficient  basis upon  which to  sentence.   We said  that the\n\ndistrict court \n\n            expressly  stated that it did not believe\n            the  government's  contention that  137.2\n            kilograms  was  involved,  which  clearly\n            indicates  that  the   court  was   never\n            convinced  of  the  reliability   of  the\n            government's evidence.  The amount set by\n            the  government  should  not,  therefore,\n            have  been adopted  by the  court  in the\n            first  instance without  having conducted\n            an  evidentiary hearing in order to reach\n            a reliable determination as to the amount\n            of cocaine.\n\nValencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d at 516.\n               \n\n          On  remand,  the  district  court  held  a  hearing  on\n\nSeptember 10, 1991 to determine the amount of cocaine involved in\n\nthe conspiracy  to be used  to set the  base offense level.   The\n\nparties stipulated that  the evidence was to be  the same as that\n\ngiven at trial.   On October 28, 1991, appellants jointly filed a\n\npro  se motion requesting the district court to subpoena a number\n       \n\nof items  relating to  the amount.2    On October  30, 1991,  the\n\n                    \n\n2  The  documents requested included the following: (1) Certified\nlogbook from U.S. Coast Guard; (2) certified logbook from British\nVirgin Islands  police vessel  St. Ursula; (3)  certified logbook\nfrom Tortola Harbor; and (4) certified logbook from Spanish  Town\nHarbor from December 31, 1988 to  January 10, 1989; (5) a copy of\nDEA  Form  473  describing   the  government's  agreements   with\nconfidential informant Rafael Manuel V zquez, a/k/a Robert Victor\n(\"V zquez\"); (6) FBI and NCE reports on V zquez; (7) all criminal\ncomplaints and records on V zquez in Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, and\nthe United  States; (8) Drug rehabilitation  services and centers\n\n                               -7-\n\ndistrict court found that the government had sustained its burden\n\nof proving that 137.2 kilograms were involved on the basis of the\n\ntestimony of the confidential  informant and because evidence not\n\nadmissible  at  trial  may  be  considered  for  the  purpose  of\n\nsentencing.\n\n          Apparently  this finding  took appellants  by surprise.\n\nAt the January  15, 1992  sentencing hearing,  the attorneys  for\n\nappellants  argued that the district court was bound by its prior\n\ndetermination that the evidence as to amount was insufficient and\n\nunreliable for  the purpose  of sentencing.   Alternatively, they\n\nrequested  that resentencing  be postponed  and that  the renewed\n\ndiscovery  request be granted to enable  appellants to offer more\n\nevidence  rebutting the  government's evidence  on the  amount of\n\ncocaine.  \n\n          The district  court denied  the motion  and resentenced\n\nthe appellants based on a finding that 137.2 kilograms of cocaine\n\nwere involved in the conspiracy.  Under the applicable Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  the  base  offense  level was  36.    Valencia-Lucena\n\nreceived  a two  level increase  for the  use of  his skill  as a\n\npilot.   The Guidelines  provide a  term of  imprisonment ranging\n\nfrom  235  to  293  months  for  that  offense  level.    He  was\n\nresentenced to 235 months imprisonment.  Basti n-Cortijo, Carpio-\n\nV lez, and Laboy-Delgado had their base offense  level reduced to\n\n34 for their  minor roles in the offense.  The  range of terms of\n\n                    \n\nattended  by V zquez; and (9) any polygraph test taken by V zquez\nand related data.\n\n                               -8-\n\nimprisonment was 151 to 181 months.  They were resentenced to 151\n\nmonths.\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\n\nA.  Base Offense Level\n                      \n\n          The crux  of appellants' argument is  that the district\n\ncourt was bound by  its prior determination that the  evidence as\n\nto the amount was insufficient and unreliable, and therefore, the\n\ndistrict  court should have based  the base offense  level on the\n\nminimum amount.  We disagree.\n\n          We thought our  earlier ruling rather  straight-forward\n\nand clear.   We held that the district court never made a factual\n                                                       \n\ndetermination  as  to  the  amount involved  in  the  conspiracy.\n\nValencia-Lucena, 925  F.2d at 515-16.   Consequently, we directed\n               \n\nthe  district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on that issue.\n\nThe  district court followed our  mandate.  It  held a hearing at\n\nwhich  the parties stipulated that the evidence would be the same\n\nas at  trial.   That stipulation was  appellants' fatal  mistake.\n\nThey  assert on  appeal that the  district court is  bound by its\n\nprevious finding on  the same evidence.

We review the district court's determination of the\n\nquantity of drugs  for which the  defendant is responsible,  like\n\nother  factual   findings  in  the  context   of  the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines,  for clear error.

The district\n                               \n\ncourt's  finding  that  137.2  kilograms were  involved  for  the\n\npurpose of calculating the base offense level did  not constitute\n\nclear error.   The  coconspirator  turned confidential  informant\n\ntestified that  appellants conspired to possess  200 kilograms of\n\ncocaine.    Appellants  failed   to  contradict  the  informant's\n\ntestimony.  Indeed,  they offered  no additional  evidence as  to\n\namount at the evidentiary hearing.  \n\n          In  addition,  the   government  recovered  only  137.2\n\nkilograms  because the coolers of cocaine were dropped in the sea\n\nfor retrieval; some  of the  coolers were apparently  lost.   The\n\ndistrict  court  could  properly  consider  the  137.2  kilograms\n\nretrieved for the  purposes of sentencing  despite the fact  that\n\nthe physical evidence of the coolers and cocaine was not admitted\n\nat  trial  because  it was  deemed  unfairly  prejudicial.   This\n\nevidence, without any alternative evidence as  to amount from the\n\nappellants,  was  a more  than  sufficient  basis  upon which  to\n\n                               -11-\n\nresentence, as the district court did.\n\nB.

They made  this new request a month  and a\n\nhalf after the September 10, 1991 evidentiary hearing mandated by\n\nthis  court.  Appellants  renewed the request  after the district\n\ncourt  found 137.2  kilograms  to have  been  the object  of  the\n\nconspiracy.  The district court denied the request.  \n\n          In effect,  appellants request two bites  at the apple.\n\nLike the district court, we are disinclined to oblige.  We review\n\nthe district court's denial of further discovery for clear error.\n\nPavao,  948 F.2d at  77; Wright, 873  F.2d at 444.   The district\n                               \n\ncourt  enjoys   wide  discretion  in  determining   relevance  at\n\nsentencing hearings.   Iguaran-Palmar, 926  F.2d at  10.   First,\n                                     \n\nappellants  had  their opportunity  to  contest  the government's\n\nevidence at the September  10, 1991 hearing; they failed  to take\n\nadvantage of it.   They cannot resuscitate that right  so late in\n\nthe  proceedings.  See Zuleta-Alvarez,  922 F.2d at  36.  Second,\n                                     \n\nthe  district  court  properly  could  find  that  the  documents\n\nrequested  ultimately  would not  affect  its  decision that  the\n\ngovernment's evidence on the  amount was sufficient and reliable.\n\nAppellants  failed  to demonstrate  how  the  documents requested\n\nwould undermine  the government's evidence.   Both defendants and\n\nthe  government  presented  testimony  and  cross  examined   the\n\n                               -12-\n\ncommanders  of  the Coast  Guard  vessel and  the  British Virgin\n\nIslands police  vessel at  trial; we  cannot see,  and appellants\n\nhave failed to show,  how the logbooks would have  added anything\n\nto the  testimony already received.   The same  can be said  with\n\nrespect  to the  documents  requested regarding  the government's\n\nconfidential informant V zquez;  appellants had ample opportunity\n\nto  assail his credibility both  at trial and  at the evidentiary\n\nhearing.    We cannot  say that  the  district court  was clearly\n\nerroneous in denying appellants' discovery request.\n\n                               -13-\n\nC.

It argues that once an amount is\n\ndetermined   for  a   temporally  limited,   small,  and   simple\n\nconspiracy, all defendants associated  with the conspiracy should\n\nbe held to foresee that amount.   Edwards involved a complex  and\n                                         \n\nsophisticated  heroin  retailing business  that  had  a chain  of\n\nsuppliers,  mid-level managers,  street vendors  and wholesalers.\n\nThe  Seventh  Circuit  required  specific  findings  as  to  each\n\ndefendant since they had  joined at different times and  may have\n\nintended to  enter a more limited  agreement.  Id. at  1397.  The\n                                                  \n\ngovernment contends  that the  foreseeability inquiry  has always\n\nfocused  upon whether the disputed conduct fell outside the scope\n                                                                 \n\nof the conspiracy in factually complicated cases.  We do not read\n\nEdwards   to  limit   the   foreseeability  inquiry   to  complex\n       \n\nconspiracies.  Nor do we find a principle that would sustain such\n\n                    \n\n5   We  garner  further  support  from  later  clarification  and\nexpansion  of   the  application  notes  to   U.S.S.G.     1B1.3.\nApplication  Note  2 currently  states  that  \"[w]ith respect  to\noffenses involving contraband (including  controlled substances),\nthe  defendant is  accountable for  all quantities  of contraband\nwith which he was directly involved  and in the case of a jointly\nundertaken   criminal   activity,   all  reasonably   foreseeable\nquantities  of  contraband  that were  within  the  scope of  the\ncriminal activity that he jointly undertook.\"  U.S.S.G.    3B1.3,\ncomment.

The criminal conspiracy net is often cast widely.\n\nIndividuals may be involved who know that the agreement they have\n\nentered  is illegal but  have no way to  foresee the magnitude or\n\nambition of the enterprise, as in the case of an individual hired\n\nto remedy  an unexpected  complication in the  main conspirators'\n\nplot.   The  Guidelines require  that the  government prove  by a\n\npreponderance  of  the  evidence   that  such  individual   could\n\nreasonably  foresee the  amount contemplated  by the  conspiracy.\n\nU.S.S.G.    2D1.4(a), 1B1.3.\n\n          Appellants  Carpio-V lez,  Basti n-Cortijo, and  Laboy-\n\nDelgado contend that  18 U.S.C.   3553(c)  (Supp. 1992)6 requires\n\nthat the district court make a specific finding of foreseeability\n\nsupported by reasoning and  facts in the record.  They argue that\n\nthe district  court's cursory  rejection of their  objection that\n\nthe government  failed to prove foreseeability runs afoul of this\n\nprovision.  The government contends that  the district court made\n\na specific  finding  on  foreseeability,  and  that  it  was  not\n\nrequired  to  provide specific,  fact  intensive  reasons as  the\n\nrecord  amply showed that appellants knew that in excess of fifty\n\n                    \n\n6  18 U.S.C.   3553(c) requires that \"[t]he court, at the time of\nsentencing,  shall  state  in  open  court  the  reasons for  its\nimposition of the  particular sentence . . . .\"   Appellants also\nargue  that Fed. R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D) imposes  that burden as\nwell.   We think that the  appellants fare better under   3553(c)\nas  Rule 32(c)(3)(D) only requires that the court make a finding.\nThe  commentary to  the Rule notes  that this does  not impose an\nonerous  burden.  \"It does not even  require the preparation of a\ntranscript.\"    Just a  finding  is  required; thus,  appellants'\nreliance on Rule 32 is misplaced.

No. 89-002, at 32 (Jan. 15, 1991).   The court then\n      \n\nrelied  on this  statement  with respect  to Basti n-Cortijo  and\n\nLaboy-Delgado.\n\n          Despite the  paucity of words from  the district court,\n\nthe record provides a sufficient  basis for the district  court's\n\nfinding  of  foreseeability   with  respect  to  Basti n-Cortijo.\n\nAppellant Basti n-Cortijo was found by the district court to have\n\nacted  as the \"kicker,\" which  means that he  flew with Valencia-\n\nLucena from Colombia, South America transporting 10 igloo coolers\n\nfilled with twenty  (20) kilograms of  cocaine each, and  dropped\n\nthe  cocaine from the plane when the pilot reached the designated\n\narea.   We  note  that Valencia-Lucena  did  not appeal  on  this\n\nground, indeed it  would have been  as frivolous  as we now  find\n\nBasti n-Cortijo's  appeal.  As  the \"kicker,\" there  is simply no\n\n                    \n\n8  We  do not address appellant's argument with  respect to which\nparty  bears  the  burden  on  the  foreseeability  issue  as  we\nunderstand the  government to believe  that it  met that  burden.\nSee Negr n, 967  F.2d at  72-73 (placing burden  on defendant  to\n          \nestablish lack of foreseeability).\n\n                               -18-\n\nway  that he could not have known  that he was dropping in excess\n\nof 50 kilograms to his coconspirators below. \n\n          Appellants'  Laboy-Delgado  and Carpio-V lez  present a\n\nbetter case.  With respect to them, the district court only found\n\nthat:   \"The  coolers  [dropped by  Valencia-Lucena and  Basti n-\n\nCortijo]  were to  be  subsequently retrieved  and imported  into\n\nPuerto Rico with  the assistance  of defendants Carpio-V lez  and\n\nLaboy[-Delgado].\"  United States  v.

This statement  is an\n\ninsufficient basis for a  finding of foreseeability.  As  we read\n\nthe  record, it is not strictly accurate as the evidence suggests\n\nthat Carpio-V lez and Laboy-Delgado  were recruited to repair the\n\nretrieval boats.  \n\n          The district  court's failure  to more fully  state the\n\nevidence  upon which it based its finding of foreseeability as to\n\nthe amount of  cocaine with  respect to  Carpio-V lez and  Laboy-\n\nDelgado  at  the sentencing  stage  has  frustrated this  court's\n\nappellate task.

The  district  court\n\ndetermined  that the amount of cocaine for the purpose of setting\n\nthe base  offense  level  was  137.2  kilograms  of  cocaine  and\n\nresentenced the defendants.  This appeal followed.\n\n          Appellants   claim   that  the   new   factual  finding\n\nconstitutes clear error.   They argue that the district  court is\n\nbound  by   its  prior   determination  that  the   evidence  was\n\ninsufficient and  unreliable to  sentence on  the basis of  137.2\n\nkilograms since  the  government offered  no new  evidence as  to\n\namount.  Appellants Basti n-Cortijo,  Laboy-Delgado, Carpio-V lez\n\nargue that the district court failed to give specific reasons for\n\nits finding  that  the amount  of  cocaine was  foreseeable,  and\n\n                               -3-\n\nfurther that  the evidence  was  insufficient to  support such  a\n\nfinding.   Finally, appellants  maintain that the  district court\n\nimproperly denied appellant Valencia-Lucena's document request at\n\nthe resentencing hearing, given  the court's new determination on\n\nthe  amount involved.   We affirm  the district  court's findings\n\nwith respect to the amount of cocaine used to  determine the base\n\noffense  level  as  well  as  its   denial  of  further  document\n\ndiscovery, but remand for specific findings on foreseeability.\n\n                      I.

The four  appellants  participated with\n      \n\nothers  not part of  this appeal in  a scheme to  fly cocaine via\n\nprivate  aircraft  from Colombia,  South  America  to the  United\n\nStates through  the Virgin Islands.   Valencia-Lucena piloted the\n\naircraft from Puerto Rico to Colombia, returning with the cocaine\n\nto the drop point in the Virgin Islands.  Basti n-Cortijo was the\n\n\"kicker\"; he acted as the bombardier, allegedly dropping ten (10)\n\nigloo  coolers containing  twenty  (20) kilograms  of cocaine  to\n\nretrieval boats waiting below.   Carpio-V lez appeared at various\n\ntimes during  the conspiracy; he apparently  repaired some wiring\n\non one of the retrieval  boats and was alleged to have  owned the\n\ncocaine at one point.  Laboy-Delgado repaired mechanical problems\n\nwith  the boats.    The  government  foiled  the  plot  with  the\n\nassistance of a coconspirator turned confidential informant.\n\n                               -4-\n\n          Initially the government  indicted appellants based  on\n\nthe coconspirator,  confidential  informant's estimate  that  the\n\nobject  of the conspiracy was the importation of 200 kilograms of\n\ncocaine.  A  first superseding indictment  reduced the amount  to\n\n173.2 kilograms.  A second superseding indictment further reduced\n\nthe amount to 137.2 kilograms, the amount of cocaine recovered by\n\nthe  government some  days  after the  arrests.   At  trial,  the\n\ndistrict court  refused  to admit  into  evidence the  amount  of\n\ncocaine involved  in the conspiracy  because it viewed  the links\n\nbetween  the seized  cocaine  and  the  defendants as  weak,  and\n\nbelieved admission  of the evidence would  unfairly prejudice the\n\ndefendants.   The district court understood  that determining the\n\nactual  amount was  not necessary  to convict  on  the conspiracy\n\ncharges.   \n\n          The  district court  sentenced codefendant  Jos  Llad -\n\nOrtiz  first.1   The  district judge  subsequently clarified  the\n\nfindings  made  at  that hearing  in  its  opinion  and order  of\n\nDecember  28,  1989.    The district  court  then  applied  these\n\nfindings to appellants.  \n\n          It  was unclear to us how the district court arrived at\n\nhis initial  sentences.  When  challenged by the  government, the\n\ndistrict  court  adopted  the government's  position  that  137.2\n\nkilograms were to  be used  for calculation of  the base  offense\n\nlevel,  but  then  proceeded to  depart  downward  based  \"on the\n\ngovernment's failure to adequately prove that the 137.2 kilograms\n\n                    \n\n1  Llad -Ortiz is not part of this appeal.\n\n                               -5-\n\nof  cocaine,  found in  coolers  the government  seized,  was the\n\ncocaine the  defendants conspired to  import.\"  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nJos   Llad -Ortiz, Crim. No. 89-002,  slip op. at  5 (D.P.R. Dec.\n                 \n\n28, 1989).   The  district court  further supported the  downward\n\ndeparture  by stating  that the  government's case  agent falsely\n\ntestified  before the grand jury.   This latter reason was in the\n\nmanner of punishment.  The court concluded that \"[u]pon reviewing\n\nthe evidence at  trial, we do not find it  sufficient to sentence\n\nthe  defendants  according  to  a quantity  based  on  the  137.2\n\nfigure.\"  Id.\n             \n\n          Under   the   applicable   United   States   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  at the time of sentencing, the base offense level for\n\n137.2  kilograms of  cocaine was  36.   United  States Sentencing\n\nGuidelines,  Guidelines Manual,     2D1.4 &amp;  2D1.1(a)(3)  (Nov. 1\n                              \n\n1989) (Drug  Quantity Table).   The district court  increased the\n\ntotal offense  level of Valencia-Lucena  to 38  for his use  of a\n\nspecial skill  in piloting  the aircraft, U.S.S.G.    3B1.3,  and\n\nreduced  the offense levels  of Carpio-V lez, Basti n-Cortijo and\n\nLaboy-Delgado to  34 for  their  minor roles  in the  conspiracy,\n\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.2(b).  As a result of the downward  departure, the\n\ndistrict   court   sentenced   all  appellants   to   120  months\n\nimprisonment. \n\n          In the previous appeal we rejected the district court's\n\ndeparture  based   on  its  \"perceived  need   to  reprimand  the\n\ngovernment,\"  holding  that departure  is  not  warranted by  the\n\nconduct  of third  parties.   More important  to this  appeal, we\n\n                               -6-\n\nremanded for resentencing because the district court purported to\n\naccept  the government's  contention  that  137.2 kilograms  were\n\ninvolved for purposes of determining the base offense  level, but\n\nthen  departed  downward  because   it  deemed  the  evidence  an\n\ninsufficient  basis upon  which to  sentence.   We said  that the\n\ndistrict court \n\n            expressly  stated that it did not believe\n            the  government's  contention that  137.2\n            kilograms  was  involved,  which  clearly\n            indicates  that  the   court  was   never\n            convinced  of  the  reliability   of  the\n            government's evidence.  The amount set by\n            the  government  should  not,  therefore,\n            have  been adopted  by the  court  in the\n            first  instance without  having conducted\n            an  evidentiary hearing in order to reach\n            a reliable determination as to the amount\n            of cocaine.\n\nValencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d at 516.\n               \n\n          On  remand,  the  district  court  held  a  hearing  on\n\nSeptember 10, 1991 to determine the amount of cocaine involved in\n\nthe conspiracy  to be used  to set the  base offense level.   The\n\nparties stipulated that  the evidence was to be  the same as that\n\ngiven at trial.   On October 28, 1991, appellants jointly filed a\n\npro  se motion requesting the district court to subpoena a number\n       \n\nof items  relating to  the amount.2    On October  30, 1991,  the\n\n                    \n\n2  The  documents requested included the following: (1) Certified\nlogbook from U.S. Coast Guard; (2) certified logbook from British\nVirgin Islands  police vessel  St. Ursula; (3)  certified logbook\nfrom Tortola Harbor; and (4) certified logbook from Spanish  Town\nHarbor from December 31, 1988 to  January 10, 1989; (5) a copy of\nDEA  Form  473  describing   the  government's  agreements   with\nconfidential informant Rafael Manuel V zquez, a/k/a Robert Victor\n(\"V zquez\"); (6) FBI and NCE reports on V zquez; (7) all criminal\ncomplaints and records on V zquez in Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, and\nthe United  States; (8) Drug rehabilitation  services and centers\n\n                               -7-\n\ndistrict court found that the government had sustained its burden\n\nof proving that 137.2 kilograms were involved on the basis of the\n\ntestimony of the confidential  informant and because evidence not\n\nadmissible  at  trial  may  be  considered  for  the  purpose  of\n\nsentencing.\n\n          Apparently  this finding  took appellants  by surprise.\n\nAt the January  15, 1992  sentencing hearing,  the attorneys  for\n\nappellants  argued that the district court was bound by its prior\n\ndetermination that the evidence as to amount was insufficient and\n\nunreliable for  the purpose  of sentencing.   Alternatively, they\n\nrequested  that resentencing  be postponed  and that  the renewed\n\ndiscovery  request be granted to enable  appellants to offer more\n\nevidence  rebutting the  government's evidence  on the  amount of\n\ncocaine.  \n\n          The district  court denied  the motion  and resentenced\n\nthe appellants based on a finding that 137.2 kilograms of cocaine\n\nwere involved in the conspiracy.  Under the applicable Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  the  base  offense  level was  36.    Valencia-Lucena\n\nreceived  a two  level increase  for the  use of  his skill  as a\n\npilot.   The Guidelines  provide a  term of  imprisonment ranging\n\nfrom  235  to  293  months  for  that  offense  level.    He  was\n\nresentenced to 235 months imprisonment.  Basti n-Cortijo, Carpio-\n\nV lez, and Laboy-Delgado had their base offense  level reduced to\n\n34 for their  minor roles in the offense.  The  range of terms of\n\n                    \n\nattended  by V zquez; and (9) any polygraph test taken by V zquez\nand related data.\n\n                               -8-\n\nimprisonment was 151 to 181 months.  They were resentenced to 151\n\nmonths.\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\n\nA.  Base Offense Level\n                      \n\n          The crux  of appellants' argument is  that the district\n\ncourt was bound by  its prior determination that the  evidence as\n\nto the amount was insufficient and unreliable, and therefore, the\n\ndistrict  court should have based  the base offense  level on the\n\nminimum amount.  We disagree.\n\n          We thought our  earlier ruling rather  straight-forward\n\nand clear.   We held that the district court never made a factual\n                                                       \n\ndetermination  as  to  the  amount involved  in  the  conspiracy.\n\nValencia-Lucena, 925  F.2d at 515-16.   Consequently, we directed\n               \n\nthe  district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on that issue.\n\nThe  district court followed our  mandate.  It  held a hearing at\n\nwhich  the parties stipulated that the evidence would be the same\n\nas at  trial.   That stipulation was  appellants' fatal  mistake.\n\nThey  assert on  appeal that the  district court is  bound by its\n\nprevious finding on  the same evidence.  But there  simply was no\n\nfinding by  which the district court could  be bound.  We plainly\n\nsaid so in  the previous appeal:  \"[t]he district court failed to\n\ndetermine the reliability of  the evidence as to the  quantity of\n\ncocaine which was used.\"  Id. at 515.\n                             \n\n          When the  quantity of drugs  used for the  base offense\n\nlevel  is in dispute, the district court must make an independent\n\nfinding  at an evidentiary hearing  as to the  reliability of the\n\n                               -9-\n\nevidence.

The district\n                               \n\ncourt's  finding  that  137.2  kilograms were  involved  for  the\n\npurpose of calculating the base offense level did  not constitute\n\nclear error.   The  coconspirator  turned confidential  informant\n\ntestified that  appellants conspired to possess  200 kilograms of\n\ncocaine.    Appellants  failed   to  contradict  the  informant's\n\ntestimony.  Indeed,  they offered  no additional  evidence as  to\n\namount at the evidentiary hearing.  \n\n          In  addition,  the   government  recovered  only  137.2\n\nkilograms  because the coolers of cocaine were dropped in the sea\n\nfor retrieval; some  of the  coolers were apparently  lost.   The\n\ndistrict  court  could  properly  consider  the  137.2  kilograms\n\nretrieved for the  purposes of sentencing  despite the fact  that\n\nthe physical evidence of the coolers and cocaine was not admitted\n\nat  trial  because  it was  deemed  unfairly  prejudicial.   This\n\nevidence, without any alternative evidence as  to amount from the\n\nappellants,  was  a more  than  sufficient  basis  upon which  to\n\n                               -11-\n\nresentence, as the district court did.\n\nB.

They made  this new request a month  and a\n\nhalf after the September 10, 1991 evidentiary hearing mandated by\n\nthis  court.  Appellants  renewed the request  after the district\n\ncourt  found 137.2  kilograms  to have  been  the object  of  the\n\nconspiracy.  The district court denied the request.  \n\n          In effect,  appellants request two bites  at the apple.\n\nLike the district court, we are disinclined to oblige.

The district\n                               \n\ncourt  enjoys   wide  discretion  in  determining   relevance  at\n\nsentencing hearings.   Iguaran-Palmar, 926  F.2d at  10.   First,\n                                     \n\nappellants  had  their opportunity  to  contest  the government's\n\nevidence at the September  10, 1991 hearing; they failed  to take\n\nadvantage of it.   They cannot resuscitate that right  so late in\n\nthe  proceedings.  See Zuleta-Alvarez,  922 F.2d at  36.  Second,\n                                     \n\nthe  district  court  properly  could  find  that  the  documents\n\nrequested  ultimately  would not  affect  its  decision that  the\n\ngovernment's evidence on the  amount was sufficient and reliable.\n\nAppellants  failed  to demonstrate  how  the  documents requested\n\nwould undermine  the government's evidence.   Both defendants and\n\nthe  government  presented  testimony  and  cross  examined   the\n\n                               -12-\n\ncommanders  of  the Coast  Guard  vessel and  the  British Virgin\n\nIslands police  vessel at  trial; we  cannot see,  and appellants\n\nhave failed to show,  how the logbooks would have  added anything\n\nto the  testimony already received.   The same  can be said  with\n\nrespect  to the  documents  requested regarding  the government's\n\nconfidential informant V zquez;  appellants had ample opportunity\n\nto  assail his credibility both  at trial and  at the evidentiary\n\nhearing.

(n.2).  We may consider this clarifying language at the\nappeal stage.  Isabel, 980 F.2d at 62.\n                     \n\n                               -15-\n\na  limitation.  The criminal conspiracy net is often cast widely.\n\nIndividuals may be involved who know that the agreement they have\n\nentered  is illegal but  have no way to  foresee the magnitude or\n\nambition of the enterprise, as in the case of an individual hired\n\nto remedy  an unexpected  complication in the  main conspirators'\n\nplot.   The  Guidelines require  that the  government prove  by a\n\npreponderance  of  the  evidence   that  such  individual   could\n\nreasonably  foresee the  amount contemplated  by the  conspiracy.\n\nU.S.S.G.    2D1.4(a), 1B1.3.\n\n          Appellants  Carpio-V lez,  Basti n-Cortijo, and  Laboy-\n\nDelgado contend that  18 U.S.C.   3553(c)  (Supp. 1992)6 requires\n\nthat the district court make a specific finding of foreseeability\n\nsupported by reasoning and  facts in the record.  They argue that\n\nthe district  court's cursory  rejection of their  objection that\n\nthe government  failed to prove foreseeability runs afoul of this\n\nprovision.  The government contends that  the district court made\n\na specific  finding  on  foreseeability,  and  that  it  was  not\n\nrequired  to  provide specific,  fact  intensive  reasons as  the\n\nrecord  amply showed that appellants knew that in excess of fifty\n\n                    \n\n6  18 U.S.C.   3553(c) requires that \"[t]he court, at the time of\nsentencing,  shall  state  in  open  court  the  reasons for  its\nimposition of the  particular sentence . . . .\"   Appellants also\nargue  that Fed. R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(D) imposes  that burden as\nwell.   We think that the  appellants fare better under   3553(c)\nas  Rule 32(c)(3)(D) only requires that the court make a finding.\nThe  commentary to  the Rule notes  that this does  not impose an\nonerous  burden.  \"It does not even  require the preparation of a\ntranscript.\"    Just a  finding  is  required; thus,  appellants'\nreliance on Rule 32 is misplaced.

[i]n\n\nlight  of  common  experience,  the evidence  showed  that  there\n\nexisted on Carpio[-V lez]'s part  foreseeability of the amount of\n\ncocaine involved  in this  case.\"  Sentencing  Hearing, Valencia-\n                                                                 \n\nLucena, Crim. No. 89-002, at 32 (Jan. 15, 1991).   The court then\n      \n\nrelied  on this  statement  with respect  to Basti n-Cortijo  and\n\nLaboy-Delgado.\n\n          Despite the  paucity of words from  the district court,\n\nthe record provides a sufficient  basis for the district  court's\n\nfinding  of  foreseeability   with  respect  to  Basti n-Cortijo.\n\nAppellant Basti n-Cortijo was found by the district court to have\n\nacted  as the \"kicker,\" which  means that he  flew with Valencia-\n\nLucena from Colombia, South America transporting 10 igloo coolers\n\nfilled with twenty  (20) kilograms of  cocaine each, and  dropped\n\nthe  cocaine from the plane when the pilot reached the designated\n\narea.   We  note  that Valencia-Lucena  did  not appeal  on  this\n\nground, indeed it  would have been  as frivolous  as we now  find\n\nBasti n-Cortijo's  appeal.  As  the \"kicker,\" there  is simply no\n\n                    \n\n8  We  do not address appellant's argument with  respect to which\nparty  bears  the  burden  on  the  foreseeability  issue  as  we\nunderstand the  government to believe  that it  met that  burden.\nSee Negr n, 967  F.2d at  72-73 (placing burden  on defendant  to\n          \nestablish lack of foreseeability).\n\n                               -18-\n\nway  that he could not have known  that he was dropping in excess\n\nof 50 kilograms to his coconspirators below. \n\n          Appellants'  Laboy-Delgado  and Carpio-V lez  present a\n\nbetter case.  With respect to them, the district court only found\n\nthat:   \"The  coolers  [dropped by  Valencia-Lucena and  Basti n-\n\nCortijo]  were to  be  subsequently retrieved  and imported  into\n\nPuerto Rico with  the assistance  of defendants Carpio-V lez  and\n\nLaboy[-Delgado].\"  United States  v.

This statement  is an\n\ninsufficient basis for a  finding of foreseeability.  As  we read\n\nthe  record, it is not strictly accurate as the evidence suggests\n\nthat Carpio-V lez and Laboy-Delgado  were recruited to repair the\n\nretrieval boats.  \n\n          The district  court's failure  to more fully  state the\n\nevidence  upon which it based its finding of foreseeability as to\n\nthe amount of  cocaine with  respect to  Carpio-V lez and  Laboy-\n\nDelgado  at  the sentencing  stage  has  frustrated this  court's\n\nappellate task.
