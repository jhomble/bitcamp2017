Edward F. Harrington, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                      Lipez, Howard and Thompson,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Timothy McGee on brief pro se.\n     Gordon P. Katz, Benjamin M. McGovern and Holland & Knight\nLLP, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                               July 8, 2010\n\f            Per   Curiam.        Appellant-plaintiff          Timothy      McGee\n\nappeals pro se from the district court's order summarily\n\ngranting defendant's motion to enforce an agreement to settle\n\nan   action    claiming     that     defendants         misappropriated     and\n\ninfringed his copyrights and other intellectual property in\n\nconnection with their production and broadcast of an animated\n\ntelevision series.         The district court, following a non-\n\nevidentiary hearing at which neither McGee nor his counsel\n\n(whose motion to withdraw had been granted several weeks\n\nearlier)    appeared,     determined       that    an   agreement    had   been\n\nreached in an e-mail exchange between plaintiff's counsel and\n\ndefendants'     counsel    and     entered    an    order     enforcing     \"the\n\nfollowing     three   essential     elements       of   the   June   10,    2009\n\nsettlement agreement: 1) payment of $12,000 to the plaintiff;\n\n2) a general release of all of the defendants and their\n\naffiliates; and 3) dismissal with prejudice of this action in\n\nits entirety.\"\n\n            On appeal, McGee disputes that a binding agreement\n\nwas ever reached on all material terms, conceding that he had\n\nagreed to the dollar figure for settlement, but that non-\n\npecuniary terms of equal importance to him (concerning his\n\nrights to royalties, credits, and continuing rights in his\n\ncopyrighted material) were never agreed upon.                     He further\n\ndisputes the court's finding that his attorney had actual or\n\n                                     -2-\n\fapparent authority to enter into any settlement agreement\n\nevidenced by the exchange of e-mails between counsel on June\n\n10, 2009.\n\n            We need not resolve whether the June 10, 2009 e-mail\n\nexchange relied upon by appellees evinces a final agreement on\n\nall material terms because we conclude that the district court\n\nerred in summarily determining that McGee's attorney had actual\n\nor apparent authority to enter into that agreement.                Because a\n\ngenuinely disputed question of material fact existed regarding\n\nsuch authority, the court erred in deciding the question\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing. See Fidelity and Guaranty Ins.\n\nCo. v. Star Equipment Corp., 541 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            The evidence before the district court did not compel\n\na finding that McGee's attorney had authority to enter a\n\nbinding settlement agreement on his behalf.                  See Malave v.\n\nCarney Hospital, 170 F.3d 217, 221 (1st Cir. 1999).                         The\n\ndistrict court's reliance upon the fact that McGee's attorney\n\nwas the attorney-of-record on this matter is misplaced.                    \"[A]\n\ngeneral     retainer,     standing      alone,    does     not    permit    an\n\nunauthorized attorney to settle claims on his client's behalf.\"\n\nMalave, 170 F.3d at 221.         That principle placed defendants on\n\nnotice that McGee's attorney's statements about his authority\n\n\"did not suffice, without more to bind [McGee] to a settlement\n\nagreement.\"    Id.   at    221   n.6;      see   also    United   States     v.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fInternational Bhd. of Teamsters, 986 F.2d 15, 20 (2d Cir. 1993)\n\n(\"customarily only the representation of the principal to the\n\nthird   party       can   create    apparent    authority,     not     the\n\nrepresentation of the agent alone\").\n\n             The district court relied upon McGee's attorney's\n\nrepresentation to the magistrate judge that he had actual\n\nauthority to settle the case on the terms communicated in the\n\nJune 10 e-mail exchange.           But, at the same hearing, McGee\n\nrepresented that his attorney did not possess authority to\n\nenter   a   final    settlement    agreement    on   those   terms.     He\n\nmaintained that \"the only thing we had agreed on that's in that\n\nemail was a dollar amount of $12,000.\"          \"We cannot conceive of\n\na more fundamental dispute concerning the existence vel non of\n\na settlement agreement than occurs when a litigant and her\n\nlawyer wrangle over whether the former imbued the latter with\n\nauthority to settle.\" Malave, 170 F.3d at 221; see also Michaud\n\nv. Michaud, 932 F.2d 77, 81 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"In circumstances\n\nwhere a former attorney and his client dispute the giving of\n\nauthority,     courts     generally   require    the    holding   of   an\n\nevidentiary hearing on the question of authorization\").\n\n             The district court relied upon McGee's affidavit as\n\nevidence that his attorney had actual authority to enter into\n\nthe settlement agreement. Specifically, it relied upon McGee's\n\nstatement that he was represented by his counsel, and that he\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fhad \"had settlement discussions with [him] about settling the\n\ncase for twelve thousand dollars ($12,000).\"                     As discussed\n\nabove, \"the retainer alone does not suffice to vest a lawyer\n\nwith settlement authority.\" Malave, 170 F.3d at 221 n. 6.                   And\n\nthe fact that McGee and his attorney may have discussed and\n\nagreed   upon   one    of   the   material   terms     of    a    preliminary\n\nsettlement offer is not sufficient to establish that McGee\n\nauthorized him to enter a final settlement agreement where\n\nother material terms had not been agreed upon.\n\n            Finally, in concluding that McGee's attorney had\n\napparent authority to enter the settlement agreement on June\n\n10,   the   district   court      stated   that   it   was       adopting   the\n\nreasoning in Bistany v. PNC Bank, NA, 585 F.Supp.2d 179, 183-84\n\n(D Mass. 2008). Reliance upon that district court case appears\n\nto be misplaced. Bistany refers to the following definition of\n\n\"apparent authority\" under Massachusetts law:\n\n            Apparent authority \"results from conduct\n            by the principal which causes a third\n            person reasonably to believe that a\n            particular person . . . has authority to\n            enter    into   negotiations   or   make\n            representations as his agent.\"\n\nId. at 182 (quoting Hudson v. Mass. Property Ins. Underwriting\n\nAss'n, 386 Mass. 450, 436 (1982)).                However, neither the\n\ndefendants, in their memorandum in support of their motion to\n\nenforce settlement, nor the district court identified any\n\n\"conduct by the principal [McGee]\" which caused the defendants\n\n                                    -5-\n\fto believe that his attorney had authority to enter a binding\n\nsettlement agreement on his client's behalf.\n\n           The legal authority cited in Bistany is inapposite.\n\nIn In re the Petition of Mal de Mer Fisheries, Inc., 884\n\nF.Supp. 635, 639 (D. Mass. 1995), the court specifically found\n\nthat the attorney acted with his client's authorization when he\n\ninformed defendant's counsel that his client accepted its offer\n\nand that \"this is not a case where a former attorney and client\n\ndispute   the   giving    of   authority   thereby    necessitating   an\n\nevidentiary hearing.\"      And in Petty v. Timken Corp., 849 F.2d\n\n130, 132-33 (4th Cir. 1988) the court stated that it was\n\n\"undisputed that [the defendant] made an offer of settlement,\n\nthat the offer was communicated to [the plaintiff] by his\n\ncounsel, that [the plaintiff] agreed to accept the settlement\n\nafter conference with his attorney, and that [the plaintiff]\n\nreaffirmed his acceptance in open court.\"            Therefore, Bistany\n\ndoes not identify any legal support for the proposition that an\n\nattorney's representation that (as an agent) he has authority\n\nto settle a case on behalf of his client (the principal) is\n\nalone sufficient to establish apparent authority.\n\n           The evidence before the district court did not compel\n\nthe   conclusion   that    McGee's   attorney   possessed    actual   or\n\napparent authority to enter into a binding settlement agreement\n\nwith defendants on the terms that they now seek to enforce.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fTherefore, the district court erred in summarily granting the\n\nmotion to enforce the settlement agreement without taking\n\nevidence and resolving the disputed issues of material fact.\n\nSee Malave, 170 F.3d at 222-223.\n\n          The district court's judgment is vacated and the case\n\nis remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nAppellant's motion to file an appendix to his reply brief is\n\ndenied as moot.   His other pending motions are denied without\n\nprejudice to his filing them in district court on remand.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f",

Timken Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507374\"><a href=\"/opinion/507374/47-fair-emplpraccas-177-46-empl-prac-dec-p-38052-robert-a-petty-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132-33 (4th Cir. 1988) the court stated that it was\n\n\"undisputed that [the defendant] made an offer of settlement,\n\nthat the offer was communicated to [the plaintiff] by his\n\ncounsel, that [the plaintiff] agreed to accept the settlement\n\nafter conference with his attorney, and that [the plaintiff]\n\nreaffirmed his acceptance in open court.\"            Therefore, Bistany\n\ndoes not identify any legal support for the proposition that an\n\nattorney's representation that (as an agent) he has authority\n\nto settle a case on behalf of his client (the principal) is\n\nalone sufficient to establish apparent authority.\n\n           The evidence before the district court did not compel\n\nthe   conclusion   that    McGee's   attorney   possessed    actual   or\n\napparent authority to enter into a binding settlement agreement\n\nwith defendants on the terms that they now seek to enforce.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fTherefore, the district court erred in summarily granting the\n\nmotion to enforce the settlement agreement without taking\n\nevidence and resolving the disputed issues of material fact.\n\nSee Malave, 170 F.3d at 222-223.\n\n          The district court's judgment is vacated and the case\n\nis remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nAppellant's motion to file an appendix to his reply brief is\n\ndenied as moot.   His other pending motions are denied without\n\nprejudice to his filing them in district court on remand.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f</pre>",
