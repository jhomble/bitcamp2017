Petitioner Nestor\n                                        \n\nOmar  Barreiro, a 40 year old citizen of Argentina, moves for\n\na  stay  of  deportation.   He  has  been  a legal  permanent\n\nresident since December  1980, is married to a  United States\n\ncitizen, and has a  ten year old son.  In October 1984 he was\n\nconvicted in the  Massachusetts Superior Court  of possession\n\nof a sizeable amount of a controlled substance with intent to\n\ndistribute and was sentenced  to the mandatory term of  10 to\n\n15 years.  He was released in April 1992, having served seven\n\nyears.   Meanwhile, in  June 1986 respondent  Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service  (INS) issued  an order to  show cause\n\nwhy   petitioner  should   not   be  deported   pursuant   to\n\n  241(a)(11) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA),\n\n8  U.S.C.   1251(a)(11)  (Supp.  1986), as  amended 8  U.S.C.\n                                                   \n\n  1251(a)(2)(B)(i) (Supp. 1992),  because of his  conviction.\n\nThis case  involves three  recent enactments:   the Anti-Drug\n\nAbuse  Act of  1988 (ADAA),  Pub. L.  No. 100-690,  102 Stat.\n\n4181;  the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Pub. L. No. 101-\n\n649,  104 Stat.  4978;  and the  Miscellaneous and  Technical\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (TINA) Pub.\n\nL. No. 102-232, 105 Stat. 1733.\n\n          In 1992  petitioner sought a waiver  of deportation\n\npursuant to INA   212(c), 8  U.S.C.   1182(c) (Supp. 1992) as\n\na seven year domiciliate.  This  was denied, and the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals affirmed, applying the final  sentence of\n\nthe section,  inserted on November  29, 1990,  that reads  as\n\nfollows:\n\n                             -2-\n\n          The  first  sentence  of this  subsection\n          shall not apply to  an alien who has been\n          convicted  of  one  or   more  aggravated\n          felonies and has  served for such  felony\n          or felonies a term of imprisonment of  at\n          least 5 years.\n\nIMMACT     511(a).     The   Board  held   that  petitioner's\n\nimprisonment,   though  largely   completed  prior   to  this\n\namendment, was comprehended therein.  We agree.\n\n          There is no question but that petitioner's offense,\n\nthough  he  was  convicted  in  a  state  proceeding,  is  an\n\naggravated   felony,  within   INA    101(a)(43),   8  U.S.C.\n\n  1101(a)(43) (Supp. 1992).1   Also, although   1182(c) reads\n\n                    \n\n1.             (43)  The  term \"aggravated  felony\"\n          means murder, any illicit  trafficking in\n          any controlled substance  (as defined  in\n          section 102 of the  Controlled Substances\n          Act),  including   any  drug  trafficking\n          crime as defined in section  924(c)(2) of\n          title  18, United  States  Code,  or  any\n          illicit  trafficking  in any  firearms or\n          destructive devices as defined in section\n          921  of such title, any offense described\n          in  section  1956  of  title  18,  United\n          States  Code  (relating to  laundering of\n          monetary  instruments),  or any  crime of\n          violence  (as defined  in  section 16  of\n          title   18,   United  States   Code,  not\n          including a purely political offense) for\n          which  the  term of  imprisonment imposed\n          (regardless  of  any  suspension of  such\n          imprisonment) is at least 5 years, or any\n          attempt or conspiracy  to commit any such\n          act.    Such  term  applies  to  offenses\n          described   in   the  previous   sentence\n          whether in violation  of Federal or State\n          law,   and   also  applies   to  offenses\n          described  in  the  previous sentence  in\n          violation  of foreign  law for  which the\n          term of imprisonment was completed within\n          the previous fifteen years.\n\n                             -3-\n\nas  limited  to  aliens  who  are  returning  from  voluntary\n\nabsences  abroad,  concededly  the  statute,  apart from  the\n\namendment, applies equally to  resident aliens who are sought\n\nto be deported.   This was established by Francis  v. I.N.S.,\n                                                            \n\n532 F.2d  268 (2d Cir. 1976).  The court there noted that the\n\nmanifest purpose was to qualify certain aliens who  had lived\n\nhere seven years  to seek a waiver, in  the discretion of the\n\nAttorney General, of the exclusionary  consequence of various\n\nprohibitions in   1182(a).  The court held that it would be a\n\ndenial  of equal  protection  to distinguish  between  aliens\n\nseeking readmission and those resisting deportation, and that\n\nconsequently   212(c) must be  applied to include the latter.\n\nThe  limited wording of the statute has not been changed, but\n\nthe Second  Circuit's ruled  enlargement has  been recognized\n\never  since.  Tapia-Acuna v.  I.N.S., 640 F.2d  223 (9th Cir.\n                                    \n\n1981).    E.g., Gouveia  v. I.N.S.,  980  F.2d 814  (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1992).   Petitioner's contention that this  ruling should not\n\napply to the  amendment is frivolous.  He  may seek a waiver,\n\nbut must fail if  his seven year imprisonment was  within the\n\nstatute.\n\n          In  addition  to  this permanent  waiver,  the  INA\n\ncontained a presumption of  a temporary stay pending judicial\n\nappeal,   106(a)(3), 8 U.S.C.   1105a(a)(3) (Supp. 1992), the\n\nunderlined words  having been  added by IMMACT    513(a), and\n\nare to \"apply to petitions to  review filed more than 60 days\n\n                             -4-\n\nafter  the  date  of  enactment  of  the  statute.\"    IMMACT\n\n  513(b).\n\n          The  service of  the petition  for review\n          . . .  shall stay the  deportation of the\n          alien   pending   determination  of   the\n          petition by  the court, unless  the court\n          otherwise directs or unless the  alien is\n                                                   \n          convicted  of  an  aggravated felony,  in\n                                                   \n          which case the Service shall not stay the\n                                                   \n          deportation   of    the   alien   pending\n                                                   \n          determination  of  the  petition  of  the\n                                                   \n          court unless the court otherwise directs.\n                                                  \n\n          Finally,  on  December  12,   1991  by  the   TINA,\n\n  306(a)(11)(B), it  was provided  that the  IMMACT amendment\n\n\"shall apply to convictions entered before, on, or after such\n\ndate,\"  and by    310(1), that  this latter  amendment \"shall\n\ntake  effect  as  if  included   in  the  enactment  of   the\n\nImmigration Act of 1990.\"\n\n          The  Board's  opinion sustaining  the  denial of  a\n\nwaiver relied  on  Matter of  A-A-,  Interim Dec.  3176  (BIA\n                                  \n\n1992),  which in  turn is  so persuasive  that we  could well\n\nsimply  agree,  but  we  will  further  comment  in  light of\n\npetitioner's persistent  complaint.  There is,  of course, no\n\nconstitutional issue,  United States  v. Bodre, 948  F.2d 28,\n                                              \n\n31-32  (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1487 (1992);\n                                    \n\nthe only question is  that of Congressional intent.   While a\n\npresumption against  retroactivity prevails in the absence of\n\nclearly contrary  indicia, Dion  v. Secretary of  H.H.S., 823\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 669, 671  (1st Cir.  1987), one must  look at the  whole\n\npicture.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          In Ayala-Chavez  v. I.N.S., 945 F.2d  288 (9th Cir.\n                                    \n\n1991) the court held  that only aggravated offenses committed\n\nafter November  18, 1988 receive the  negative presumption of\n\nno  temporary  waiver  pending  appeal.   The  TINA  followed\n\npromptly,    and   the   Ninth    Circuit   recognized   that\n\n  306(a)(11)(B)  was  intended   to  overrule   Ayala-Chavez.\n                                                            \n\nArthurs v. I.N.S., 959  F.2d 142 (9th  Cir. 1992).  See  also\n                                                             \n\nIgnacio v. I.N.S., 955 F.2d 295 (5th Cir. 1992); Matter of A-\n                                                             \n\nA-, supra.  The legislative history makes clear that this was\n         \n\nfully recognized as a technical amendment for  clarification.\n\nActually  the amendment was introduced into and passed by the\n\nSenate on August 1,  1991, prior to Ayala-Chavez.   137 Cong.\n                                                \n\nRec.  S11,799-804.    Offering   the  bill,  Senator  Simpson\n\ndescribed  it  as  \"truly  technical. . . .    The  Bill  was\n\ndeveloped  under  the following  rule:   If  any of  the four\n\nImmigration Subcommittee's staffs [Republican and Democrat of\n\nthe House and Senate] found a provision controversial or non-\n\ntechnical,  then  it  was removed.\"    Id  at  S11,799.   The\n                                         \n\nfollowing November  25, post Ayala-Chavez, an identical House\n                                         \n\nbill  passed.  Id.  at H11,245-251.  The  next day the Senate\n                 \n\nmade minor  amendments, id.  at S18,506-514, which  the House\n                          \n\npromptly accepted.  Id. at H11,485-493.  One of these changes\n                      \n\nwas the addition of  the 'before, on, or after'  amendment to\n\n  513(b).\n\n                             -6-\n\n          We have  two reasons  for agreeing with  the Board.\n\nIn  the  first place,  we  believe  Ayala-Chavez was  wrongly\n                                                \n\ndecided.    If  Congress  believed  seven  years'   residence\n\ninsufficient to entitle aliens to waivers if they had  served\n\nfive or more years  imprisonment for committing an aggravated\n\nfelony, it makes small sense that so substantial  a stricture\n\nshould not go into effect for five years from enactment.  The\n\npresumption against a  retroactive interpretation is to  give\n\nfair warning so that a party may avoid consequences.  This is\n\nscarcely  a situation calling for  any such a  warning.  Five\n\nyears   free  time  would   be  extraordinarily  considerate,\n\nparticularly for the undeserving.\n\n          In addition,  as we  study the legislation  and the\n\nlegislative  history,  we  believe  that   although  Congress\n\namended  only    513(b),   its  failure  to  amend     511(b)\n\ncorrespondingly was a simple oversight.  We do not believe it\n\nnecessary, however, to detail  further the several steps that\n\nlead us to that conclusion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -7-\n",

Petitioner Nestor\n                                        \n\nOmar  Barreiro, a 40 year old citizen of Argentina, moves for\n\na  stay  of  deportation.   He  has  been  a legal  permanent\n\nresident since December  1980, is married to a  United States\n\ncitizen, and has a  ten year old son.  In October 1984 he was\n\nconvicted in the  Massachusetts Superior Court  of possession\n\nof a sizeable amount of a controlled substance with intent to\n\ndistribute and was sentenced  to the mandatory term of  10 to\n\n15 years.  He was released in April 1992, having served seven\n\nyears.   Meanwhile, in  June 1986 respondent  Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service  (INS) issued  an order to  show cause\n\nwhy   petitioner  should   not   be  deported   pursuant   to\n\n  241(a)(11) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA),\n\n8  U.S.C.   1251(a)(11)  (Supp.  1986), as  amended 8  U.S.C.\n                                                   \n\n  1251(a)(2)(B)(i) (Supp. 1992),  because of his  conviction.\n\nThis case  involves three  recent enactments:   the Anti-Drug\n\nAbuse  Act of  1988 (ADAA),  Pub. L.  No. 100-690,  102 Stat.\n\n4181;  the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Pub. L. No. 101-\n\n649,  104 Stat.  4978;  and the  Miscellaneous and  Technical\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (TINA) Pub.\n\nL. No. 102-232, 105 Stat. 1733.\n\n          In 1992  petitioner sought a waiver  of deportation\n\npursuant to INA   212(c), 8  U.S.C.   1182(c) (Supp. 1992) as\n\na seven year domiciliate.  This  was denied, and the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals affirmed, applying the final  sentence of\n\nthe section,  inserted on November  29, 1990,  that reads  as\n\nfollows:\n\n                             -2-\n\n          The  first  sentence  of this  subsection\n          shall not apply to  an alien who has been\n          convicted  of  one  or   more  aggravated\n          felonies and has  served for such  felony\n          or felonies a term of imprisonment of  at\n          least 5 years.\n\nIMMACT     511(a).     The   Board  held   that  petitioner's\n\nimprisonment,   though  largely   completed  prior   to  this\n\namendment, was comprehended therein.  We agree.\n\n          There is no question but that petitioner's offense,\n\nthough  he  was  convicted  in  a  state  proceeding,  is  an\n\naggravated   felony,  within   INA    101(a)(43),   8  U.S.C.\n\n  1101(a)(43) (Supp. 1992).1   Also, although   1182(c) reads\n\n                    \n\n1.             (43)  The  term \"aggravated  felony\"\n          means murder, any illicit  trafficking in\n          any controlled substance  (as defined  in\n          section 102 of the  Controlled Substances\n          Act),  including   any  drug  trafficking\n          crime as defined in section  924(c)(2) of\n          title  18, United  States  Code,  or  any\n          illicit  trafficking  in any  firearms or\n          destructive devices as defined in section\n          921  of such title, any offense described\n          in  section  1956  of  title  18,  United\n          States  Code  (relating to  laundering of\n          monetary  instruments),  or any  crime of\n          violence  (as defined  in  section 16  of\n          title   18,   United  States   Code,  not\n          including a purely political offense) for\n          which  the  term of  imprisonment imposed\n          (regardless  of  any  suspension of  such\n          imprisonment) is at least 5 years, or any\n          attempt or conspiracy  to commit any such\n          act.    Such  term  applies  to  offenses\n          described   in   the  previous   sentence\n          whether in violation  of Federal or State\n          law,   and   also  applies   to  offenses\n          described  in  the  previous sentence  in\n          violation  of foreign  law for  which the\n          term of imprisonment was completed within\n          the previous fifteen years.\n\n                             -3-\n\nas  limited  to  aliens  who  are  returning  from  voluntary\n\nabsences  abroad,  concededly  the  statute,  apart from  the\n\namendment, applies equally to  resident aliens who are sought\n\nto be deported.   This was established by Francis  v. I.N.S.,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334136\"><a href=\"/opinion/334136/ernest-francis-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1976).  The court there noted that the\n\nmanifest purpose was to qualify certain aliens who  had lived\n\nhere seven years  to seek a waiver, in  the discretion of the\n\nAttorney General, of the exclusionary  consequence of various\n\nprohibitions in   1182(a).  The court held that it would be a\n\ndenial  of equal  protection  to distinguish  between  aliens\n\nseeking readmission and those resisting deportation, and that\n\nconsequently   212(c) must be  applied to include the latter.\n\nThe  limited wording of the statute has not been changed, but\n\nthe Second  Circuit's ruled  enlargement has  been recognized\n\never  since.

The legislative history makes clear that this was\n         \n\nfully recognized as a technical amendment for  clarification.\n\nActually  the amendment was introduced into and passed by the\n\nSenate on August 1,  1991, prior to Ayala-Chavez.   137 Cong.\n                                                \n\nRec.  S11,799-804.    Offering   the  bill,  Senator  Simpson\n\ndescribed  it  as  \"truly  technical. . . .    The  Bill  was\n\ndeveloped  under  the following  rule:   If  any of  the four\n\nImmigration Subcommittee's staffs [Republican and Democrat of\n\nthe House and Senate] found a provision controversial or non-\n\ntechnical,  then  it  was removed.\"    Id  at  S11,799.   The\n                                         \n\nfollowing November  25, post Ayala-Chavez, an identical House\n                                         \n\nbill  passed.  Id.  at H11,245-251.  The  next day the Senate\n                 \n\nmade minor  amendments, id.  at S18,506-514, which  the House\n                          \n\npromptly accepted.  Id. at H11,485-493.  One of these changes\n                      \n\nwas the addition of  the 'before, on, or after'  amendment to\n\n  513(b).\n\n                             -6-\n\n          We have  two reasons  for agreeing with  the Board.\n\nIn  the  first place,  we  believe  Ayala-Chavez was  wrongly\n                                                \n\ndecided.    If  Congress  believed  seven  years'   residence\n\ninsufficient to entitle aliens to waivers if they had  served\n\nfive or more years  imprisonment for committing an aggravated\n\nfelony, it makes small sense that so substantial  a stricture\n\nshould not go into effect for five years from enactment.  The\n\npresumption against a  retroactive interpretation is to  give\n\nfair warning so that a party may avoid consequences.  This is\n\nscarcely  a situation calling for  any such a  warning.  Five\n\nyears   free  time  would   be  extraordinarily  considerate,\n\nparticularly for the undeserving.\n\n          In addition,  as we  study the legislation  and the\n\nlegislative  history,  we  believe  that   although  Congress\n\namended  only    513(b),   its  failure  to  amend     511(b)\n\ncorrespondingly was a simple oversight.  We do not believe it\n\nnecessary, however, to detail  further the several steps that\n\nlead us to that conclusion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -7-\n</pre>",
