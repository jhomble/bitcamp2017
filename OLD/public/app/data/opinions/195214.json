The judgment of the district court is\n                     \n\naffirmed.  The court, essentially, adopts the language of the\n\ndistrict court's  order  dated August  11,  1993,  reproduced\n\nherein.\n\n                          O R D E R\n                                   \n\n          Like  most   other  states,1   New  Hampshire   has\n\n\"recreational  use\" laws limiting the common law liability of\n\ncertain  owners   and  occupants  who  make   their  property\n\navailable for recreational  use by  others.   In the  present\n\ncase,  Sean Collins  has sued  the owners  and managers  of a\n\nprivate beach to  recover for injuries suffered  when he dove\n\ninto  shallow water  from  a  dock  installed at  the  beach.\n\nSeveral of  the defendants  have moved  for summary  judgment\n\nclaiming the  protection of the  recreational use laws.   The\n\nsuccess  of  these motions  depends  upon:   (i)  whether the\n\nrecreational use statutes are inapplicable  because the beach\n\nwas developed land  that was not open to  the general public;\n\n(ii)  whether any of  the defendants willfully  disregarded a\n\ndangerous condition that  resulted in Collins'  injuries; and\n\n(iii) whether either  \"consideration\" or a \"charge\"  was paid\n\nfor access to the beach.\n\n                    \n\n1.  See Klepper v. City of Milford, 825 F.2d 1440, 1444 (10th\n                                  \nCir. 1987) (\"Similar  legislation has been enacted  in nearly\nall  of the  fifty states\");  see also  Robin  Cheryl Miller,\n                                      \nEffect of Statute Limiting Landowner's Liability for Personal\n                                                             \nInjury to Recreational User, 47 A.L.R. 4th 262 (1986).\n                           \n\n                             -2-\n\n          For  the reasons  that  follow,  I  hold  that  the\n\nrecreational  use laws are  applicable here.   Accordingly, I\n\ngrant defendants' motions for summary judgment.\n\n                          I.  FACTS\n                                   \n\n          On  August  5,  1989, Collins  was  invited  by his\n\ncousin  to  swim at  the  Cobbett's  Pond  Park beach.    The\n\ninjuries giving  rise to  this action  occurred when  Collins\n\ndove from a  dock at the  beach into shallow water  and broke\n\nhis neck.\n\n          Title to  the beach is  held by the  Cobbett's Pond\n\nCommunity  Trust (\"Trust\").   The beneficiaries of  the Trust\n\nare the  residents of Cobbett's  Pond Park, all of  whom also\n\nhave  a deeded  right of  access  to the  beach.   Defendants\n\nWilliam  Donovan,  William  Benkoski, and  Oliver  Tarr  were\n\nappointed  trustees  of  the  Trust in  1958.    Although the\n\ntrustees have  not been  involved in  the  management of  the\n\nbeach  for  several years,  the Trust  has not  been formally\n\ndissolved.  Nor  have any of the defendants  been replaced as\n\ntrustees.\n\n          When  Collins was injured, the beach was managed by\n\nan unincorporated association known as The Community Group of\n\nCobbett's   Pond,  Inc.   (\"Association\").     Although   the\n\nAssociation  at one  time had  been an  active  New Hampshire\n\ncorporation,  the corporation was  dissolved in 1977  and was\n\n                             -3-\n\nnot reinstated until 1992.  Membership in the Association was\n\nlimited to residents  of Cobbett's Pond Park.   The Bylaws of\n\nthe  Association  required  members to  pay  annual  dues and\n\nstated  that membership privileges  would be revoked  if dues\n\nwere not paid.\n\n          The Association  was responsible for setting up and\n\nmaintaining the dock Collins dove  from when he was  injured.\n\nThe  Association was  also responsible  for establishing  and\n\nenforcing beach  rules.   The beach was  posted as  a private\n\nbeach and  only residents  of Cobbett's Pond  Park and  their\n\nguests were allowed to use it.\n\n                       II.  DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          New  Hampshire has  two  recreational use  statutes\n\nthat may limit the liability  of the defendants in this case.\n\nN.H.  Rev. Stat.  Ann. (\"RSA\")    212:34  (1989) provides  in\n\npertinent part:\n\n          I.    An  owner,  lessee  or  occupant of\n          premises  owes no  duty of  care to  keep\n          such  premises safe  for entry or  use by\n          others  for  hunting,  fishing, trapping,\n          camping, water  sports, winter  sports or\n          OHRVs  as defined  in RSA  215-A, hiking,\n          sightseeing, or  removal of  fuelwood, or\n          to   give   any  warning   of   hazardous\n          conditions,  uses   of,  structures,   or\n          activities  on such  premises to  persons\n          entering  for  such purposes,  except  as\n          provided in paragraph III hereof. . . .\n\n          III.   This  section does  not limit  the\n          liability which otherwise exists:\n\n                             -4-\n\n               (a)    For   willful,  or  malicious\n          failure  to  guard  or   warn  against  a\n          dangerous condition,  use, structure,  or\n          activity; or\n\n               (b)  For injury suffered in any case\n          where  permission  to hunt,  fish,  trap,\n          camp, hike, use for  water sports, winter\n          sports  or use of OHRVs as defined in RSA\n          215-A, sightsee,  or remove  fuelwood was\n          granted for consideration  other than the\n          consideration,  if  any,   paid  to  said\n          landowner by the state . . . .\n\n          RSA 508:14 (Supp. 1992) provides in pertinent part:\n\n          I.    An owner,  occupant,  or  lessee of\n          land,   including   the  state   or   any\n          political subdivision, who without charge\n          permits  any  person  to   use  land  for\n          recreational purposes  or as  a spectator\n          of  recreational activity,  shall not  be\n          liable  for personal  injury or  property\n          damage  in the  absence of  intentionally\n          caused injury or damage.\n\n          The  trustee defendants  have  been  sued in  their\n\ncapacity   as  owners  of  the  beach,  and  the  Association\n\ndefendants have been sued as occupants.   Because Collins was\n\ninjured while engaged in  a \"water sport\" within the  meaning\n\nof RSA 212:34 and a  \"recreational use\" within the meaning of\n\nRSA  508:14, the defendants  claim that they  are entitled to\n\ninvoke both recreational use statutes.2\n\n                    \n\n2.  Plaintiff  half-heartedly  argues  that   RSA  580:14  is\ninapplicable here  because he was injured in the water rather\nthan on  land.   Although the court  in Kanter  v. Combustion\n                                                             \nEngineering, 701 F. Supp. 943, 946  (D.N.H. 1988) declined on\n           \nthis basis to apply RSA 508:14 to claims brought on behalf of\ntwo men who  drowned while swimming and canoeing  at the base\nof a dam,  that case is  distinguishable because Collins  was\ninjured while diving  from a dock attached to  the land owned\nand operated  by the  defendants, whereas  the plaintiffs  in\n\n                             -5-\n\n          Collins  attacks   these  arguments   from  several\n\nperspectives.  First,  he contends that the  recreational use\n\nstatutes  only protect owners of large, undeveloped tracts of\n\nland who make their property available to the general public.\n\nSince the  beach, in contrast,  is a developed tract  of land\n\nthat is open only to members of Cobbett's Pond Park and their\n\nguests, Collins  argues that  the statutes  are inapplicable.\n\nSecond, Collins  contends that a factual dispute exists as to\n\nwhether  any of the defendants willfully caused his injuries.\n\nAccordingly,   he  argues  that   the  applicability  of  the\n\nrecreational use laws  cannot be determined through  a motion\n\nfor  summary judgment.   Finally,  Collins  argues that  both\n\nstatutes  are inapplicable  because  the  dues  paid  by  the\n\nAssociation  members and  the  payments  Cobbett's Pond  Park\n\nlandowners  made  to  purchase  their  lots  constitute  both\n\n\"consideration\" under  RSA 212:34  and a  \"charge\" under  RSA\n\n508:14.  I address each argument in turn.3\n\n                    \n\nKanter did not gain access  to the water from the defendant's\n      \nproperty.\n\n3.  In  assessing the parties' motions, I apply the following\nprinciples.    Summary   judgment  is  appropriate  \"if   the\npleadings,  depositions,  answers   to  interrogatories,  and\nadmissions on  file, together  with the  affidavits, if  any,\nshow that there is no  genuine issue as to any  material fact\nand that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law.\"  Fed.  R. Civ. P. 56(c).   A \"genuine\" issue is  one\n\"that  properly can  be resolved  only  by a  finder of  fact\nbecause  [it] may reasonably  be resolved in  favor of either\nparty.\"  Anderson  v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477  U.S. 242, 250\n                                         \n(1986); accord  Garside v.

See Hallacker v. National Bank &amp;\n                                                             \n\nTrust Co. of  Gloucester, 806 F.2d 488, 491  (3rd Cir. 1986);\n                        \n\nMiller v.

Although\n               \n\nI   accept   Collins'   contention   that   New   Hampshire's\n\nrecreational  use  statutes  should  be  narrowly   construed\n\nbecause they are in derogation  of the common law, see, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nKanter v.

Hemsdorf, 135  N.H. 360, 363 (1992),  I will\n                         \n\nnot   read  into  these   statutes  a  limitation   that  the\n\nlegislature  left  out.   Unlike  similar  statutes  in other\n\njurisdictions and the model recreational use statute proposed\n\nby  the Council  of  State  Governments,  the  New  Hampshire\n\nrecreational   use  statutes  do  not  contain  any  language\n\n                    \n\nthe outcome of the suit . . . .\"   Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.\n                                           \nThe  burden is upon  the moving party  to aver the  lack of a\ngenuine,  material factual issue,  Finn v.

However,  when\n\ninterpreting  RSA 275:42  IV, which  provides for  liquidated\n\ndamages against an  employer who \"willfully and  without good\n\n                             -8-\n\ncause\" failed to pay wages  within 72 hours of discharging an\n\nemployee, the Court  defined \"willfully\" as \"a  voluntary act\n\ncommitted  with an  intent to  cause its  results.\"   Ives v.\n                                                          \n\nManchester Subaru, Inc.,  126 N.H. 796, 801  (1985) (citation\n                       \n\nomitted);  see  also  Appeal  of  New  Hampshire  Sweepstakes\n                                                             \n\nComm'n, 130 N.H. 659, 664 (1988) (declaring that \"willful\" is\n      \n\nsynonymous with intentional or deliberate).\n\n          Collins  argues  for  a  somewhat  more   expansive\n\ndefinition of willfully.  Specifically, he urges the adoption\n\nof the definition used by  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nwhen it  construed  California's  recreational  use  statute.\n\nUnder  the California  statute, the Ninth  Circuit determined\n\nthat landowners will be found to have acted willfully if they\n\nacted with \"(1) actual or constructive knowledge of the peril\n\nto  be apprehended; (2) actual or constructive knowledge that\n\ninjury was is  a probable, as opposed to  possible, result of\n\nthe danger;  and (3) conscious  failure to avoid  the peril.\"\n\nSpires v.  United States, 805  F.2d 832, 834 (9th  Cir. 1986)\n                        \n\n(citing Cal. Civ. Code   846 (West 1985)).\n\n          Even using the Ninth Circuit's definition,  Collins\n\nhas presented  insufficient evidence of willfulness  to allow\n\nthis issue  to be decided by a jury.   Collins notes that the\n\ndock was installed in shallow  water and from this fact alone\n\nasks the court  to infer  that one or  more of the  defendant\n\nconsciously disregarded  a probability that  someone would be\n\n                             -9-\n\ninjured by diving from  the dock.   I decline to accept  this\n\nargument.   At best,  such evidence  establishes a  basis for\n\nCollins'  claim that  the defendants were  negligent.   It is\n\nsimply  insufficient,   standing  alone,  to   establish  the\n\nexistence  of a genuine dispute as  to whether defendants had\n\nactual  knowledge  that an  injury  such as  the  one Collins\n\nsuffered was a probable result of the installation and use of\n\nthe dock.\n\n          C.   Was Either \"Consideration\" or  a \"Charge\" Paid\n                                                             \n               for Access to the Beach?\n                                       \n\n          Collins argues  that dues  paid by  members of  the\n\nAssociation  and the payments  made by residents  of the Park\n\nwhen  they purchased  their  lots constitute  \"consideration\"\n\nunder RSA  212:34 and a  \"charge\" under  RSA 508:14.   I find\n\nneither argument persuasive.\n\n          Although  Collins contends  that  residents of  the\n\nPark were required to pay dues to the Association in order to\n\nuse the  beach, he  has failed to  point to  any evidence  to\n\nsupport  this claim.   The  deed conveying  the beach  to the\n\nTrust provides that the beach \"is to be kept open forever for\n\nthe benefit  of lot owners  and their guests.\"   None of  the\n\ndocuments produced  by either side suggest that access to the\n\nbeach may be denied to lot owners who fail to pay dues to the\n\nAssociation.   Although the Bylaws of the Association provide\n\nthat a failure  to pay dues will result in  the suspension of\n\nmembership privileges,  access to the beach is  a right which\n\n                             -10-\n\nresidents  of Cobbett's Pond  Park enjoy whether  or not they\n\nare members of the Association.   Accordingly, the payment of\n\nAssociation dues cannot  be either consideration or  a charge\n\npaid in  exchange for access  to the beach.   Cf. Simchuk  v.\n                                                         \n\nAngel Island  Community Ass'n, 253  Mont. 221, 226,  833 P.2d\n                             \n\n158, 161 (1992)  (dues charged by Homeowners  Association for\n\naccess  to  recreational  areas managed  by  the  Association\n\nconstitutes consideration barring application of recreational\n\nuse statute to claim brought by an injured guest of  a member\n\nof the association).\n\n          While it is undisputed that  access to the beach is\n\nlimited to  residents of  the Park and  their guests,  I also\n\ncannot  accept Collins'  argument  that  the  price  paid  to\n\npurchase a lot  in the Park constitutes  either consideration\n\nor a charge  for access to the  beach.  If the  price paid to\n\nbecome an owner of property  devoted in part to  recreational\n\nuses  also  constitutes  consideration  for  access   to  the\n\nproperty   that  prevents   the   owner  from   invoking  the\n\nrecreational use  statutes, the  statutes  would be  rendered\n\nmeaningless because every owner would  be deemed to have paid\n\nconsideration for access to the property by virtue of  having\n\npaid to  purchase the  property.   The New  Hampshire Supreme\n\nCourt  would not interpret these exceptions  so broadly as to\n\nrender  the statutes meaningless.   New  England Brickmaster,\n                                                             \n\nInc. v. Salem, 133 N.H. 655, 663 (1990).  Moreover, I  see no\n             \n\n                             -11-\n\nreason why a different result would apply here simply because\n\nthe landowners paid for a  deeded right of access rather than\n\nan ownership interest in the beach.\n\n          Finally,  even if payments  made to purchase  a lot\n\nwith deeded access rights to the beach could in some sense be\n\ndeemed consideration  or a  charge for  access to the  beach,\n\nsuch payments  do not  render the  recreational use  statutes\n\ninapplicable because  none of the defendants  benefitted from\n\nthe payments.  The  obvious purpose of the  consideration and\n\ncharge  exceptions  is  to prevent  owners  and  occupants of\n\nproperty  from avoiding liability for their own negligence if\n\nthey receive a benefit in exchange for making their  property\n\navailable for recreational  uses by others.   This purpose is\n\nnot served by denying owners and occupants the  protection of\n\nthe recreational  use statutes  simply because  a benefit  is\n\npaid to  an unconnected  third party.   Accordingly,  Collins\n\ncannot  rely on  the consideration  and  charge exception  to\n\navoid the application of the recreational use statutes.\n\n                        I.

In the present case, Sean Collins has sued the owners and managers of a private beach to recover for injuries suffered when he dove into shallow water from a dock installed at the beach.  Several of the defendants have moved for summary judgment claiming the protection of the recreational use laws.  The success of these motions depends upon:  (i) whether the recreational use statutes are inapplicable because the beach was developed land that was not open to the general public;  (ii) whether any of the defendants willfully disregarded a dangerous condition that resulted in Collins' injuries;  and (iii) whether either \"consideration\" or a \"charge\" was paid for access to the beach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons that follow, I hold that the recreational use laws are applicable here.  Accordingly, I grant defendants' motions for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 5, 1989, Collins was invited by his cousin to swim at the Cobbett's Pond Park beach.  The injuries giving rise to this action occurred when Collins dove from a dock at the beach into shallow water and broke his neck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title to the beach is held by the Cobbett's Pond Community Trust (\"Trust\").  The beneficiaries of the Trust are the residents of Cobbett's Pond Park, all of whom also have a deeded right of access to the beach.  Defendants William Donovan, William Benkoski, and Oliver Tarr were appointed trustees of the Trust in 1958.  Although the trustees have not been involved in the management of the beach for several years, the Trust has not been formally dissolved.  Nor have any of the defendants been replaced as trustees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Collins was injured, the beach was managed by an unincorporated association known as The Community Group of Cobbett's Pond, Inc.  (\"Association\").  Although the Association at one time had been an active New Hampshire corporation, the corporation was dissolved in 1977 and was not reinstated until 1992.  Membership in the Association was limited to residents of Cobbett's Pond Park.  The Bylaws of the Association required members to pay annual dues and stated that membership privileges would be revoked if dues were not paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Association was responsible for setting up and maintaining the dock Collins dove from when he was injured.  The Association was also responsible for establishing and enforcing beach rules.  The beach was posted as a private beach and only residents of Cobbett's Pond Park and their guests were allowed to use it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Hampshire has two recreational use statutes that may limit the liability of the defendants in this case.  N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. (\"RSA\") Sec. 212:34 (1989) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>I.  An owner, lessee or occupant of premises owes no duty of care to keep such premises safe for entry or use by others for hunting, fishing, trapping, camping, water sports, winter sports or OHRVs as defined in RSA 215-A, hiking, sightseeing, or removal of fuelwood, or to give any warning of hazardous conditions, uses of, structures, or activities on such premises to persons entering for such purposes, except as provided in paragraph III hereof....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>III.  This section does not limit the liability which otherwise exists:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) For willful, or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) For injury suffered in any case where permission to hunt, fish, trap, camp, hike, use for water sports, winter sports or use of OHRVs as defined in RSA 215-A, sightsee, or remove fuelwood was granted for consideration other than the consideration, if any, paid to said landowner by the state....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RSA 508:14 (Supp.1992) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>I.  An owner, occupant, or lessee of land, including the state or any political subdivision, who without charge permits any person to use land for recreational purposes or as a spectator of recreational activity, shall not be liable for personal injury or property damage in the absence of intentionally caused injury or damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee defendants have been sued in their capacity as owners of the beach, and the Association defendants have been sued as occupants.  Because Collins was injured while engaged in a \"water sport\" within the meaning of RSA 212:34 and a \"recreational use\" within the meaning of RSA 508:14, the defendants claim that they are entitled to invoke both recreational use statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins attacks these arguments from several perspectives.  First, he contends that the recreational use statutes only protect owners of large, undeveloped tracts of land who make their property available to the general public.  Since the beach, in contrast, is a developed tract of land that is open only to members of Cobbett's Pond Park and their guests, Collins argues that the statutes are inapplicable.  Second, Collins contends that a factual dispute exists as to whether any of the defendants willfully caused his injuries.  Accordingly, he argues that the applicability of the recreational use laws cannot be determined through a motion for summary judgment.  Finally, Collins argues that both statutes are inapplicable because the dues paid by the Association members and the payments Cobbett's Pond Park landowners made to purchase their lots constitute both \"consideration\" under RSA 212:34 and a \"charge\" under RSA 508:14.  I address each argument in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Do the Recreational Use Statutes Apply Only to Large, Undeveloped Tracts of Land That Are Open to the General Public?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins cites various cases in other jurisdictions for the proposition that recreational use statutes are applicable only to large, undeveloped tracts of land that are open to the general public.  See Hallacker v. National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Gloucester, 806 F.2d 488, 491 (3rd Cir.1986);  Miller v. United States, 597 F.2d 614, 617 (7th Cir.1979);  Wymer v. Holmes, 429 Mich. 66, 412 N.W.2d 213, 217 (1987).  Although I accept Collins' contention that New Hampshire's recreational use statutes should be narrowly construed because they are in derogation of the common law, see, e.g., Kantner v. Combustion Eng'g, 701 F.Supp. 943, 946 (D.N.H.1988);  State v. Hermsdorf, 135 N.H. 360, 363, 605 A.2d 1045 (1992), I will not read into these statutes a limitation that the legislature left out.  Unlike similar statutes in other jurisdictions and the model recreational use statute proposed by the Council of State Governments, the New Hampshire recreational use statutes do not contain any language suggesting a requirement that the land at issue must be either undeveloped or open to the general public.  Compare RSA 508:14 and 212:34 with Conn.Gen.Stat. Sec. 52-557(g)(a) (\"an owner of land who makes all or any part of the land available to the public ... owes no duty of care....\") and The Council of State Governments, Public Recreation on Private Lands:  Limitations on Liability, Suggested State Legislation, Volume XXIV (1965) (\"the purpose of this act is to encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes....\").  Accordingly, Collins cannot rely on this argument to avoid summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Did Any of Defendants Wilfully Cause the Plaintiff's Injuries?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An owner or occupant may not invoke RSA 212:34 if plaintiff's injury was caused by a \"willful\" or \"malicious\" failure to warn or guard against the activity that resulted in the injury.  Collins argues that a factual dispute exists as to whether the defendants in this case acted wilfully.  Accordingly, he contends that the applicability of RSA 212:34 cannot be determined through a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RSA 212:34 does not define \"willfully,\" and the New Hampshire Supreme Court has not yet determined what the word means in the context of this statute.  However, when interpreting RSA 275:44 IV, which provides for liquidated damages against an employer who \"willfully and without good cause\" failed to pay wages within 72 hours of discharging an employee, the Court defined \"willfully\" as \"a voluntary act committed with an intent to cause its results.\"  Ives v. Manchester Subaru, Inc., 126 N.H. 796, 801, 498 A.2d 297 (1985) (citation omitted);  see also Appeal of New Hampshire Sweepstakes Comm'n, 130 N.H. 659, 664, 547 A.2d 241 (1988) (declaring that \"willful\" is synonymous with intentional or deliberate).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins argues for a somewhat more expansive definition of willfully.  Specifically, he urges the adoption of the definition used by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals when it construed California's recreational use statute.  Under the California statute, the Ninth Circuit determined that landowners will be found to have acted willfully if they acted with \"(1) actual or constructive knowledge of the peril to be apprehended;  (2) actual or constructive knowledge that injury was is a probable, as opposed to possible, result of the danger;  and (3) conscious failure to avoid the peril.\"  Spires v. United States, 805 F.2d 832, 834 (9th Cir.1986) (citing Cal.Civ.Code Sec. 846 (West 1985)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even using the Ninth Circuit's definition, Collins has presented insufficient evidence of willfulness to allow this issue to be decided by a jury.  Collins notes that the dock was installed in shallow water and from this fact alone asks the court to infer that one or more of the defendant consciously disregarded a probability that someone would be injured by diving from the dock.  I decline to accept this argument.  At best, such evidence establishes a basis for Collins' claim that the defendants were negligent.  It is simply insufficient, standing alone, to establish the existence of a genuine dispute as to whether defendants had actual knowledge that an injury such as the one Collins suffered was a probable result of the installation and use of the dock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Was Either \"Consideration\" or a \"Charge\" Paid for Access to the Beach?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins argues that dues paid by members of the Association and the payments made by residents of the Park when they purchased their lots constitute \"consideration\" under RSA 212:34 and a \"charge\" under RSA 508:14.  I find neither argument persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Collins contends that residents of the Park were required to pay dues to the Association in order to use the beach, he has failed to point to any evidence to support this claim.  The deed conveying the beach to the Trust provides that the beach \"is to be kept open forever for the benefit of lot owners and their guests.\"   None of the documents produced by either side suggest that access to the beach may be denied to lot owners who fail to pay dues to the Association.  Although the Bylaws of the Association provide that a failure to pay dues will result in the suspension of membership privileges, access to the beach is a right which residents of Cobbett's Pond Park enjoy whether or not they are members of the Association.  Accordingly, the payment of Association dues cannot be either consideration or a charge paid in exchange for access to the beach.  Cf. Simchuk v. Angel Island Community Ass'n, 253 Mont. 221, 226, 833 P.2d 158, 161 (1992) (dues charged by Homeowners Association for access to recreational areas managed by the Association constitutes consideration barring application of recreational use statute to claim brought by an injured guest of a member of the association).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is undisputed that access to the beach is limited to residents of the Park and their guests, I also cannot accept Collins' argument that the price paid to purchase a lot in the Park constitutes either consideration or a charge for access to the beach.  If the price paid to become an owner of property devoted in part to recreational uses also constitutes consideration for access to the property that prevents the owner from invoking the recreational use statutes, the statutes would be rendered meaningless because every owner would be deemed to have paid consideration for access to the property by virtue of having paid to purchase the property.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court would not interpret these exceptions so broadly as to render the statutes meaningless.  New England Brickmaster, Inc. v. Salem, 133 N.H. 655, 663, 582 A.2d 601 (1990).  Moreover, I see no reason why a different result would apply here simply because the landowners paid for a deeded right of access rather than an ownership interest in the beach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if payments made to purchase a lot with deeded access rights to the beach could in some sense be deemed consideration or a charge for access to the beach, such payments do not render the recreational use statutes inapplicable because none of the defendants benefitted from the payments.  The obvious purpose of the consideration and charge exceptions is to prevent owners and occupants of property from avoiding liability for their own negligence if they receive a benefit in exchange for making their property available for recreational uses by others.  This purpose is not served by denying owners and occupants the protection of the recreational use statutes simply because a benefit is paid to an unconnected third party.  Accordingly, Collins cannot rely on the consideration and charge exception to avoid the application of the recreational use statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

A \"genuine\" issue is one \"that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because [it] may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986);  accord Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990).  A \"material\" issue is one that \"affect[s] the outcome of the suit....\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510.   The burden is upon the moving party to aver the lack of a genuine, material factual issue, Finn v.

In the present case, Sean Collins has sued the owners and managers of a private beach to recover for injuries suffered when he dove into shallow water from a dock installed at the beach.  Several of the defendants have moved for summary judgment claiming the protection of the recreational use laws.  The success of these motions depends upon:  (i) whether the recreational use statutes are inapplicable because the beach was developed land that was not open to the general public;  (ii) whether any of the defendants willfully disregarded a dangerous condition that resulted in Collins' injuries;  and (iii) whether either \"consideration\" or a \"charge\" was paid for access to the beach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons that follow, I hold that the recreational use laws are applicable here.  Accordingly, I grant defendants' motions for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 5, 1989, Collins was invited by his cousin to swim at the Cobbett's Pond Park beach.  The injuries giving rise to this action occurred when Collins dove from a dock at the beach into shallow water and broke his neck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title to the beach is held by the Cobbett's Pond Community Trust (\"Trust\").  The beneficiaries of the Trust are the residents of Cobbett's Pond Park, all of whom also have a deeded right of access to the beach.  Defendants William Donovan, William Benkoski, and Oliver Tarr were appointed trustees of the Trust in 1958.  Although the trustees have not been involved in the management of the beach for several years, the Trust has not been formally dissolved.  Nor have any of the defendants been replaced as trustees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Collins was injured, the beach was managed by an unincorporated association known as The Community Group of Cobbett's Pond, Inc.  (\"Association\").  Although the Association at one time had been an active New Hampshire corporation, the corporation was dissolved in 1977 and was not reinstated until 1992.  Membership in the Association was limited to residents of Cobbett's Pond Park.  The Bylaws of the Association required members to pay annual dues and stated that membership privileges would be revoked if dues were not paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Association was responsible for setting up and maintaining the dock Collins dove from when he was injured.  The Association was also responsible for establishing and enforcing beach rules.  The beach was posted as a private beach and only residents of Cobbett's Pond Park and their guests were allowed to use it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Hampshire has two recreational use statutes that may limit the liability of the defendants in this case.  N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. (\"RSA\") Sec. 212:34 (1989) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>I.  An owner, lessee or occupant of premises owes no duty of care to keep such premises safe for entry or use by others for hunting, fishing, trapping, camping, water sports, winter sports or OHRVs as defined in RSA 215-A, hiking, sightseeing, or removal of fuelwood, or to give any warning of hazardous conditions, uses of, structures, or activities on such premises to persons entering for such purposes, except as provided in paragraph III hereof....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>III.  This section does not limit the liability which otherwise exists:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) For willful, or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) For injury suffered in any case where permission to hunt, fish, trap, camp, hike, use for water sports, winter sports or use of OHRVs as defined in RSA 215-A, sightsee, or remove fuelwood was granted for consideration other than the consideration, if any, paid to said landowner by the state....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RSA 508:14 (Supp.1992) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>I.  An owner, occupant, or lessee of land, including the state or any political subdivision, who without charge permits any person to use land for recreational purposes or as a spectator of recreational activity, shall not be liable for personal injury or property damage in the absence of intentionally caused injury or damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee defendants have been sued in their capacity as owners of the beach, and the Association defendants have been sued as occupants.  Because Collins was injured while engaged in a \"water sport\" within the meaning of RSA 212:34 and a \"recreational use\" within the meaning of RSA 508:14, the defendants claim that they are entitled to invoke both recreational use statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins attacks these arguments from several perspectives.  First, he contends that the recreational use statutes only protect owners of large, undeveloped tracts of land who make their property available to the general public.  Since the beach, in contrast, is a developed tract of land that is open only to members of Cobbett's Pond Park and their guests, Collins argues that the statutes are inapplicable.  Second, Collins contends that a factual dispute exists as to whether any of the defendants willfully caused his injuries.  Accordingly, he argues that the applicability of the recreational use laws cannot be determined through a motion for summary judgment.  Finally, Collins argues that both statutes are inapplicable because the dues paid by the Association members and the payments Cobbett's Pond Park landowners made to purchase their lots constitute both \"consideration\" under RSA 212:34 and a \"charge\" under RSA 508:14.  I address each argument in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Do the Recreational Use Statutes Apply Only to Large, Undeveloped Tracts of Land That Are Open to the General Public?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins cites various cases in other jurisdictions for the proposition that recreational use statutes are applicable only to large, undeveloped tracts of land that are open to the general public.  See Hallacker v. National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Gloucester, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480187\"><a href=\"/opinion/480187/elaine-hallacker-individually-and-as-administratrix-and-administratrix-ad/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 491 (3rd Cir.1986);  Miller v.

Although I accept Collins' contention that New Hampshire's recreational use statutes should be narrowly construed because they are in derogation of the common law, see, e.g., Kantner v. Combustion Eng'g, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1474029\"><a href=\"/opinion/1474029/kantner-v-combustion-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Unlike similar statutes in other jurisdictions and the model recreational use statute proposed by the Council of State Governments, the New Hampshire recreational use statutes do not contain any language suggesting a requirement that the land at issue must be either undeveloped or open to the general public.  Compare RSA 508:14 and 212:34 with Conn.Gen.Stat. Sec. 52-557(g)(a) (\"an owner of land who makes all or any part of the land available to the public ... owes no duty of care....\") and The Council of State Governments, Public Recreation on Private Lands:  Limitations on Liability, Suggested State Legislation, Volume XXIV (1965) (\"the purpose of this act is to encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes....\").  Accordingly, Collins cannot rely on this argument to avoid summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Did Any of Defendants Wilfully Cause the Plaintiff's Injuries?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An owner or occupant may not invoke RSA 212:34 if plaintiff's injury was caused by a \"willful\" or \"malicious\" failure to warn or guard against the activity that resulted in the injury.  Collins argues that a factual dispute exists as to whether the defendants in this case acted wilfully.  Accordingly, he contends that the applicability of RSA 212:34 cannot be determined through a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RSA 212:34 does not define \"willfully,\" and the New Hampshire Supreme Court has not yet determined what the word means in the context of this statute.  However, when interpreting RSA 275:44 IV, which provides for liquidated damages against an employer who \"willfully and without good cause\" failed to pay wages within 72 hours of discharging an employee, the Court defined \"willfully\" as \"a voluntary act committed with an intent to cause its results.\"  Ives v. Manchester Subaru, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></span>, 801, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></span> (1985) (citation omitted);  see also Appeal of New Hampshire Sweepstakes Comm'n, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></span>, 664, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></span> (1988) (declaring that \"willful\" is synonymous with intentional or deliberate).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins argues for a somewhat more expansive definition of willfully.  Specifically, he urges the adoption of the definition used by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals when it construed California's recreational use statute.  Under the California statute, the Ninth Circuit determined that landowners will be found to have acted willfully if they acted with \"(1) actual or constructive knowledge of the peril to be apprehended;  (2) actual or constructive knowledge that injury was is a probable, as opposed to possible, result of the danger;  and (3) conscious failure to avoid the peril.\"  Spires v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479430\"><a href=\"/opinion/479430/john-spires-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span>, 834 (9th Cir.1986) (citing Cal.Civ.Code Sec. 846 (West 1985)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even using the Ninth Circuit's definition, Collins has presented insufficient evidence of willfulness to allow this issue to be decided by a jury.  Collins notes that the dock was installed in shallow water and from this fact alone asks the court to infer that one or more of the defendant consciously disregarded a probability that someone would be injured by diving from the dock.  I decline to accept this argument.  At best, such evidence establishes a basis for Collins' claim that the defendants were negligent.  It is simply insufficient, standing alone, to establish the existence of a genuine dispute as to whether defendants had actual knowledge that an injury such as the one Collins suffered was a probable result of the installation and use of the dock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Was Either \"Consideration\" or a \"Charge\" Paid for Access to the Beach?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins argues that dues paid by members of the Association and the payments made by residents of the Park when they purchased their lots constitute \"consideration\" under RSA 212:34 and a \"charge\" under RSA 508:14.  I find neither argument persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Collins contends that residents of the Park were required to pay dues to the Association in order to use the beach, he has failed to point to any evidence to support this claim.  The deed conveying the beach to the Trust provides that the beach \"is to be kept open forever for the benefit of lot owners and their guests.\"   None of the documents produced by either side suggest that access to the beach may be denied to lot owners who fail to pay dues to the Association.  Although the Bylaws of the Association provide that a failure to pay dues will result in the suspension of membership privileges, access to the beach is a right which residents of Cobbett's Pond Park enjoy whether or not they are members of the Association.  Accordingly, the payment of Association dues cannot be either consideration or a charge paid in exchange for access to the beach.  Cf. Simchuk v. Angel Island Community Ass'n, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></span>, 226, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"882514\"><a href=\"/opinion/882514/simchuk-v-angel-island-community-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 161 (1992) (dues charged by Homeowners Association for access to recreational areas managed by the Association constitutes consideration barring application of recreational use statute to claim brought by an injured guest of a member of the association).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is undisputed that access to the beach is limited to residents of the Park and their guests, I also cannot accept Collins' argument that the price paid to purchase a lot in the Park constitutes either consideration or a charge for access to the beach.  If the price paid to become an owner of property devoted in part to recreational uses also constitutes consideration for access to the property that prevents the owner from invoking the recreational use statutes, the statutes would be rendered meaningless because every owner would be deemed to have paid consideration for access to the property by virtue of having paid to purchase the property.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court would not interpret these exceptions so broadly as to render the statutes meaningless.  New England Brickmaster, Inc. v. Salem, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></span>, 663, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></span> (1990).  Moreover, I see no reason why a different result would apply here simply because the landowners paid for a deeded right of access rather than an ownership interest in the beach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if payments made to purchase a lot with deeded access rights to the beach could in some sense be deemed consideration or a charge for access to the beach, such payments do not render the recreational use statutes inapplicable because none of the defendants benefitted from the payments.  The obvious purpose of the consideration and charge exceptions is to prevent owners and occupants of property from avoiding liability for their own negligence if they receive a benefit in exchange for making their property available for recreational uses by others.  This purpose is not served by denying owners and occupants the protection of the recreational use statutes simply because a benefit is paid to an unconnected third party.  Accordingly, Collins cannot rely on the consideration and charge exception to avoid the application of the recreational use statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.
