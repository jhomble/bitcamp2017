Petitioner Pablo Santana-Medina, a\n\nnative and citizen of the Dominican Republic, seeks review of a\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision denying his application\n\nfor cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b).                 That\n\nprovision requires an alien to show, inter alia, \"that removal\n\nwould result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the\n\nalien's spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United\n\nStates or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\"             8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(D).\n\n            Santana-Medina claims that he satisfies this requirement\n\nbecause his thirteen-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, would face\n\nexceptional and extremely unusual hardship if Santana-Medina were\n\ndeported.    The BIA relied on the IJ's reasoning and rejected this\n\nargument.     Santana-Medina   now    argues   that   the   IJ   applied   an\n\nincorrect legal standard by failing to consider his son's best\n\ninterests as the primary criterion in its analysis, which Santana-\n\nMedina claims is required under the United Nations Convention on\n\nthe Rights of the Child.\n\n            By statute, orders regarding cancellation of removal are\n\nnot subject to judicial review, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(I),\n\nunless the appeal raises a question of law or a constitutional\n\nclaim, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).       Santana-Medina's legal claim\n\non appeal was not made before the IJ or BIA, and his other claims\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fmerely challenge the IJ's factual determinations.               We hold that we\n\nlack jurisdiction to review the denial of his application.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            In 1989, Santana-Medina arrived in the United States\n\nwithout inspection.       He has lived in San Juan, Puerto Rico since\n\n1990.   In 1991, he married a U.S. citizen, and his then-wife filed\n\nan   immediate     relative   visa   petition      for   him.    The   visa   was\n\napproved,    and    on   December    8,    1992,    Santana-Medina     obtained\n\nconditional resident status.\n\n            On September 30, 1994, Santana-Medina and his then-wife\n\nfiled a joint I-751 petition to remove the conditions on his\n\npermanent residence. However, numerous inconsistencies in Santana-\n\nMedina's interview with an immigration official on June 15, 1995\n\ndrew into question whether he and his wife had entered into a good\n\nfaith marriage.      On August 11, 1995, the I-751 petition was denied\n\nand Santana-Medina's status as a permanent resident was terminated.\n\n            In 1996, Santana-Medina had a son as a result of an\n\naffair with another woman.       The son was born in Puerto Rico and is\n\nnow in his early teens.        He is a U.S. citizen and lives with his\n\nmother, step-father, and three half-siblings in San Juan.\n\n            On August 27, 2001, Santana-Medina's marriage ended, and\n\non January 15, 2004, he filed an I-751 petition to remove the\n\nconditions on his residence; he filed this as a waiver application,\n\nclaiming that he had entered into a good faith marriage.                       On\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fOctober 5, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denied\n\nthe petition and terminated Santana-Medina's conditional resident\n\nstatus.\n\n            On January 30, 2007, DHS initiated removal proceedings\n\nand filed a Notice to Appear, charging that Santana-Medina was\n\nremovable because his conditional permanent resident status had\n\nbeen terminated.     Santana-Medina responded by reapplying for a\n\nwaiver under I-751, but at a October 12, 2007 hearing before an IJ,\n\nhe confirmed that he would instead pursue only cancellation of\n\nremoval and, in the alternative, voluntary departure.\n\n            In two hearings before an IJ on May 14, 2008, and May 28,\n\n2008, Santana-Medina argued that he was entitled to cancellation of\n\nremoval because his son, who was eleven at the time, would face\n\nexceptional and extremely unusual hardship if Santana-Medina were\n\ndeported.   In support of his claim, Santana-Medina testified about\n\nhis relationship with his son and introduced a report from a\n\npsychologist and a letter from a social worker at his son's school.\n\nThe child and the child's mother also testified.\n\n            Santana-Medina testified that if he were deported back to\n\nthe Dominican Republic, the child's mother would not let him take\n\nhis son with him.     He said that although his son lives with his\n\nmother, he presently has custody of his son from Friday at 5 p.m.\n\nto Sunday at 5 p.m.    He explained that when he and his son spend\n\ntime together, they frequently play baseball, and Santana-Medina\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fpurchases many necessities for his son.     Santana-Medina concluded\n\nthat if he were deported, it would be traumatic for his son and\n\nwould likely prevent his son from becoming a professional athlete,\n\nas Santana-Medina hopes for him.\n\n            The psychologist's report suggested that if Santana-\n\nMedina were deported, his son would likely suffer severe emotional\n\nharm because \"[w]hen the child lo[ses] contact with his father it\n\ncan be infer[red] that he could be affected emotionally suffering\n\nsevere depression.\" But some of the statements in this report were\n\ndenied by Santana-Medina in his testimony.\n\n            The social worker's letter stated that Santana-Medina\n\nregularly spent time with his son, provided for him, and played\n\nbaseball with him often, and that his son expressed a desire to be\n\nwith him.    The letter concluded that it would be better for the son\n\nif his father were close enough to stay in frequent contact.\n\n            The son's mother testified that Santana-Medina is a good\n\nfather who spends time with him frequently and takes care of all of\n\nhis needs, except for lodging and food during the week.      She added\n\nthat Santana-Medina was able to take his son out for entertainment\n\nand to play baseball, which she could not do because of her three\n\nother   small   children.    She   suggested   that   Santana-Medina's\n\ndeportation would be traumatic to her son because of his closeness\n\nto his father and his father's ability to give his son undivided\n\nattention.    The child testified that he enjoyed spending time with\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fhis father and that they frequently played baseball and went places\n\ntogether.       In addition, Santana-Medina's employers, who employed\n\nhim   for   a    period   of    years    as    a   handyman,    attested    to   his\n\ntrustworthiness and reliability.\n\n              In an oral decision at the end of the May 28, 2008,\n\nhearing, the IJ found Santana-Medina ineligible for cancellation of\n\nremoval. The IJ held that Santana-Medina had satisfied some of the\n\nrequirements for cancellation because he had been continuously\n\npresent in the United States for no less than ten years, was a\n\nperson of good moral character, and had not been convicted of\n\nrelevant offenses.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(A)-(C).               However,\n\nafter   the     IJ   weighed    the     relevant    testimony    and   supporting\n\ndocumentation, the IJ held that Santana-Medina had not established\n\nthe   statutory      standard    of   \"exceptional     and     extremely    unusual\n\nhardship\" to his son as a result of his removal.                       See id. §\n\n1229b(b)(1)(D).\n\n              The IJ stated that the relevant standard was whether the\n\nalien's son \"would suffer hardship that is substantially beyond\n\nthat which ordinarily would be expected to result from a person's\n\ndeparture,\" but not necessarily \"unconscionable\" hardship.                   The IJ\n\nfound that Santana-Medina had not satisfied this standard because,\n\nalthough the evidence clearly showed Santana-Medina was a good\n\nfather who provided for and spent time with his son, \"[t]he\n\nhardship that the respondent's son will suffer is a hardship that\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fis typical of any child who would have a father transfer from one\n\nstate to another state.\" The IJ cited the fact that Santana-Medina\n\ncould likely remain in close contact with his son even after\n\ndeportation,       since     Santana-Medina      would    be   in   the    Dominican\n\nRepublic, not far from Puerto Rico.                The IJ also questioned the\n\ncredibility of the psychologist's report, deeming it \"a little bit\n\ntailor made\" and noting numerous inaccuracies in the report.\n\n              On October 23, 2009, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision\n\nand   adopted      its    reasoning.       The   BIA   specifically       found   that\n\nalthough Santana-Medina had shown his son would be adversely\n\naffected by his removal, he had failed to show exceptional and\n\nextremely     unusual      hardship    substantially      beyond    the    hardships\n\nordinarily associated with deportation.                The BIA also affirmed the\n\nIJ's order granting voluntary departure.\n\n                                           II.\n\n              Ordinarily, by statute, \"no court shall have jurisdiction\n\nto review . . . any judgment regarding the granting of relief under\n\nsection   .    .   .     1229b,\"   which   governs     cancellation       of   removal\n\ndecisions. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(I); see also Kucana v. Holder,\n\n130 S. Ct. 827, 831-32, 837 (2010).              Jurisdiction may be restored,\n\nhowever, if an appeal of a decision regarding cancellation of\n\nremoval raises \"constitutional claims or questions of law,\" as\n\nopposed to factual issues.             8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D); Parvez v.\n\nKeisler, 506 F.3d 93, 96 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f            Santana-Medina claims that he falls under this exception\n\nbecause his appeal raises a question of law regarding the legal\n\nstandard the IJ applied for cancellation of removal.              He argues\n\nthat because his petition is based on hardship to his child, the IJ\n\nwas required to apply the \"exceptional and extremely unusual\n\nhardship\"   standard,   8   U.S.C.    §    1229b(b)(1)(D),   in   a   manner\n\nconsistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the\n\nChild, adopted Nov. 20, 1989, 1577 U.N.T.S. 3, reprinted in 28\n\nI.L.M. 1448, which Santana-Medina takes as \"customary international\n\nlaw.\"   He specifically argues that when the IJ considered whether\n\nSantana-Medina's removal would result in exceptional and extremely\n\nunusual hardship to his son, the IJ ignored the Convention's\n\nArticle 3(1) requirement that \"the best interests of the child\" be\n\nmade a \"primary consideration.\" See id., 1577 U.N.T.S. at 46, 28\n\nI.L.M. at 1459.\n\n            We need not determine whether the Convention is binding\n\nlaw or whether it even applies in the removal context.             Santana-\n\nMedina never made this argument before the IJ or the BIA.             It is\n\ntherefore waived, and Santana-Medina cannot invoke it as a basis\n\nfor jurisdiction.\n\n            Santana-Medina also argues that the psychologist's report\n\nand the facts he presented regarding his son's current family\n\nsituation   and   emotional   needs    satisfied   the   exceptional     and\n\nextremely unusual hardship standard, and that the IJ erred in\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdetermining otherwise.     This is a plain challenge to the IJ's\n\nfactual determination; indeed, Santana-Medina does not even style\n\nthis as a claim of legal error.    As the government argues, this is\n\nat best a   challenge to the way the IJ weighed the evidence\n\npresented, not to the standards it applied in doing so.                 \"To\n\ntrigger our jurisdiction\" under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D), \"the\n\nputative constitutional or legal challenge must be more than a\n\ndisguised challenge to factual findings.\"         Pan v. Gonzales, 489\n\nF.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 2007); see also Parvez, 506 F.3d at 97.\n\n          The   petition   for   review   is   dismissed   for   lack    of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

That\n\nprovision requires an alien to show, inter alia, \"that removal\n\nwould result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the\n\nalien's spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United\n\nStates or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\"             8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(D).\n\n            Santana-Medina claims that he satisfies this requirement\n\nbecause his thirteen-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, would face\n\nexceptional and extremely unusual hardship if Santana-Medina were\n\ndeported.

However, numerous inconsistencies in Santana-\n\nMedina's interview with an immigration official on June 15, 1995\n\ndrew into question whether he and his wife had entered into a good\n\nfaith marriage.      On August 11, 1995, the I-751 petition was denied\n\nand Santana-Medina's status as a permanent resident was terminated.\n\n            In 1996, Santana-Medina had a son as a result of an\n\naffair with another woman.

She   suggested   that   Santana-Medina's\n\ndeportation would be traumatic to her son because of his closeness\n\nto his father and his father's ability to give his son undivided\n\nattention.    The child testified that he enjoyed spending time with\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fhis father and that they frequently played baseball and went places\n\ntogether.       In addition, Santana-Medina's employers, who employed\n\nhim   for   a    period   of    years    as    a   handyman,    attested    to   his\n\ntrustworthiness and reliability.\n\n              In an oral decision at the end of the May 28, 2008,\n\nhearing, the IJ found Santana-Medina ineligible for cancellation of\n\nremoval. The IJ held that Santana-Medina had satisfied some of the\n\nrequirements for cancellation because he had been continuously\n\npresent in the United States for no less than ten years, was a\n\nperson of good moral character, and had not been convicted of\n\nrelevant offenses.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(A)-(C).               However,\n\nafter   the     IJ   weighed    the     relevant    testimony    and   supporting\n\ndocumentation, the IJ held that Santana-Medina had not established\n\nthe   statutory      standard    of   \"exceptional     and     extremely    unusual\n\nhardship\" to his son as a result of his removal.                       See id. §\n\n1229b(b)(1)(D).\n\n              The IJ stated that the relevant standard was whether the\n\nalien's son \"would suffer hardship that is substantially beyond\n\nthat which ordinarily would be expected to result from a person's\n\ndeparture,\" but not necessarily \"unconscionable\" hardship.                   The IJ\n\nfound that Santana-Medina had not satisfied this standard because,\n\nalthough the evidence clearly showed Santana-Medina was a good\n\nfather who provided for and spent time with his son, \"[t]he\n\nhardship that the respondent's son will suffer is a hardship that\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fis typical of any child who would have a father transfer from one\n\nstate to another state.\" The IJ cited the fact that Santana-Medina\n\ncould likely remain in close contact with his son even after\n\ndeportation,       since     Santana-Medina      would    be   in   the    Dominican\n\nRepublic, not far from Puerto Rico.                The IJ also questioned the\n\ncredibility of the psychologist's report, deeming it \"a little bit\n\ntailor made\" and noting numerous inaccuracies in the report.\n\n              On October 23, 2009, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision\n\nand   adopted      its    reasoning.       The   BIA   specifically       found   that\n\nalthough Santana-Medina had shown his son would be adversely\n\naffected by his removal, he had failed to show exceptional and\n\nextremely     unusual      hardship    substantially      beyond    the    hardships\n\nordinarily associated with deportation.                The BIA also affirmed the\n\nIJ's order granting voluntary departure.\n\n                                           II.\n\n              Ordinarily, by statute, \"no court shall have jurisdiction\n\nto review . . . any judgment regarding the granting of relief under\n\nsection   .    .   .     1229b,\"   which   governs     cancellation       of   removal\n\ndecisions. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(I); see also Kucana v.

He argues\n\nthat because his petition is based on hardship to his child, the IJ\n\nwas required to apply the \"exceptional and extremely unusual\n\nhardship\"   standard,   8   U.S.C.    §    1229b(b)(1)(D),   in   a   manner\n\nconsistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the\n\nChild, adopted Nov. 20, 1989, 1577 U.N.T.S. 3, reprinted in 28\n\nI.L.M. 1448, which Santana-Medina takes as \"customary international\n\nlaw.\"   He specifically argues that when the IJ considered whether\n\nSantana-Medina's removal would result in exceptional and extremely\n\nunusual hardship to his son, the IJ ignored the Convention's\n\nArticle 3(1) requirement that \"the best interests of the child\" be\n\nmade a \"primary consideration.\" See id., 1577 U.N.T.S. at 46, 28\n\nI.L.M. at 1459.\n\n            We need not determine whether the Convention is binding\n\nlaw or whether it even applies in the removal context.             Santana-\n\nMedina never made this argument before the IJ or the BIA.             It is\n\ntherefore waived, and Santana-Medina cannot invoke it as a basis\n\nfor jurisdiction.\n\n            Santana-Medina also argues that the psychologist's report\n\nand the facts he presented regarding his son's current family\n\nsituation   and   emotional   needs    satisfied   the   exceptional     and\n\nextremely unusual hardship standard, and that the IJ erred in\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdetermining otherwise.     This is a plain challenge to the IJ's\n\nfactual determination; indeed, Santana-Medina does not even style\n\nthis as a claim of legal error.    As the government argues, this is\n\nat best a   challenge to the way the IJ weighed the evidence\n\npresented, not to the standards it applied in doing so.                 \"To\n\ntrigger our jurisdiction\" under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D), \"the\n\nputative constitutional or legal challenge must be more than a\n\ndisguised challenge to factual findings.\"         Pan v.
