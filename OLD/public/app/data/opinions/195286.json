Petitioner  seeks  a  writ  of  mandamus\n                \n\ndirecting the district court to set aside its order, pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b),  separating the trial of the claims\n\nbrought by plaintiffs against petitioner from the third party\n\nclaims brought by petitioner for contribution and indemnity. \n\n     To be  entitled to  the writ,  a petitioner must,  inter\n                                                             \n\nalia, \"ordinarily demonstrate that something about the order,\n    \n\nor  its  circumstances  would  make  an   end-of-case  appeal\n\nineffectual or  leave legitimate interests unduly  at risk.\" \n\nIn re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653,  656 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting In\n                                                             \n\nre  Recticel Foam  Corp., 859  F.2d 1000,  1005-06 (1st  Cir.\n                       \n\n1988)).  Petitioner has failed to show make such a showing.  \n\n     The  order  for  separate  trials,  rather  than  ending\n\npetitioner's  right to  pursue its  claims against  the third\n\nparty  defendants,  establishes   petitioner's  right  to   a\n\nseparate trial and judgment.  See 6 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M.\n                                 \n\nKane, Federal Practice and  Procedure   1463, at 473  (1990).\n                                     \n\nFurthermore,  unless a  lesser judgment  is certified  by the\n\ncourt, there will be  no final judgment until all  the issues\n\nin  the whole  case have  been determined.   Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n\n54(b).    In  either  case,  upon  entry  of  final judgment,\n\npetitioner  has the  right to  appeal the  grant of  separate\n\ntrials  and to secure a new trial should the separation prove\n\nto  have been  an abuse  of discretion.   See,  e.g., Franchi\n                                                             \n\n                             -2-\n\nConstr.  Co. v. Combined Ins.

The fact  that a  separate\n\ntrial will entail delay in any possible recovery against  the\n\nthird  party defendants  and more  burdensome  litigation for\n\npetitioner is insufficient, by  itself, to justify the remedy\n\nof mandamus.  See In re Pearson, 990 F.2d at 661.  \n                               \n\n     Petitioner's request for a writ of mandamus is denied.1\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n1.  For similar reasons, we decline  to consider petitioner's\nchallenge  to the  separation  order  under  the  \"collateral\norder\"  doctrine.
