Lopez  Romo, United  States  Attorney,  was  on brief  for\n                     \nappellees.\n\n                                           \n\n                                           \n\n                   \n\n*Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\n          FUSTE, District Judge.   The main question presented in\n                               \n\nthis appeal is whether appellant properly notified the agency for\n\nwhich she  worked,  the  Army  and Air  Force  Exchange  Service,\n\n(AAFES), of her potential federal tort claim.  The district court\n\nfound  the  letter  sent  to  the  agency by  appellant's  lawyer\n\ndeficient for purposes of  the statutory notice provision of  the\n\nFederal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.   2675(a).  We find that under\n\nthis circuit's  flexible rule  regarding notice  requirements for\n\nfederal tort claims, the letter was sufficient as to part  of the\n\nclaim.\n\n                                I.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Appellant, Lynette Santiago-Ram rez,  was removed  from\n\nher  post at  the  cash register  of  Fort Buchanan's  Army  Post\n\nExchange  store on June 29, 1990, under suspicion of having taken\n\npart in an  employee theft ring.  She was  interrogated for about\n\nforty-five  minutes in  her supervisor's  office.   She  was then\n\ntaken to the office of Mr. Jacques Zayde, the Safety and Security\n\nManager  of  the Exchange,  where she  was  again subjected  to a\n\nforty-five-minute  interrogation.  Appellant  alleges that, among\n\nother  things, she was threatened with  investigation by the FBI.\n\nAfter what  she alleges  was considerable harassment  in complete\n\ndisregard  for her  pregnant condition,  she eventually  signed a\n\ntypewritten  statement.  She was  then returned to  the office of\n\nher supervisor, who  informed her  that she  had been  terminated\n\nfrom her job.  Upon concluding the investigation, no charges were\n\npressed against plaintiff.\n\n          On  September  25, 1990,  appellant's  attorney  sent a\n\nletter to the  Director of Administration  of the AAFES,  stating\n\nthat  appellant  was filing  an  administrative  complaint.   The\n\nletter  specifically mentioned  that appellant was  mistreated by\n\nofficers and agents of the  agency in a manner which  resulted in\n\n\"emotional distress  and mental  suffering.\"  The  letter further\n\nstated the exact  remedy which appellant was  requesting from the\n\nagency:  \"reinstallation of  Mrs. Santiago  to her  position, the\n\npayment of any salaries and benefits and the reinstatement of any\n\nrights she would have earned if not improperly discharged and the\n\namount of $50,000.00.\"   The  agency replied with  a letter  that\n\nindicated it was treating  the case as a routine  dismissal under\n\nmilitary  regulations.   The letter  stated that  \"Ms. Santiago's\n\nrights to reinstatement were  governed by the provisions  of Army\n\nRegulation (AR) 60-21/Air Force  Regulation (AFR) 147-15.\"  These\n\nregulations  require  that an  appeal  of  an adverse  action  be\n\nbrought  within twenty-one  days.   Since appellant's  letter had\n\nbeen sent  after the twenty-one-day period,  the agency indicated\n\nthat  it could  take no  action because  she lacked  a regulatory\n\nbasis for a  review of her complaint.   The agency letter,  while\n\naddressing the reinstatement and  back-pay claim, did not respond\n\nto the claim for damages for emotional distress.  \n\n          After   receiving  this  letter,  appellant  filed  the\n\npresent  suit in the United  States District Court.   She brought\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nsuit  against her  employer,  AAFES,  as  well as  her  immediate\n\nsupervisor, Mayra Moore, and the security manager, Jacques Zayde,\n\nunder the Tucker  Act, 28  U.S.C.   1346(a)(2),  and the  Federal\n\nTort  Claims Act,  28 U.S.C.     1346, 2671-2680.    The district\n\ncourt dismissed the suit after substituting the  United States as\n\nthe proper  party.   The district  court  found that  appellant's\n\nletter did not give  the agency sufficient notice  of appellant's\n\nclaim and that appellant's complaint stated a cause of action for\n\nfalse imprisonment, a cause of action excepted under the statute.\n\n28 U.S.C.   2680(h).  Appellant now appeals the dismissal  of the\n\nclaims under the Federal Tort Claims Act. \n\n                               II.\n\n                     FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT\n                                            \n\nA.  Administrative Requirements of the FTCA\n                                           \n\n          The Federal  Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.    1346,\n\n2671-2680, waives the sovereign immunity of  the United States to\n\nsuits in tort.  The prerequisite for liability under the Act is a\n\n\"negligent or wrongful  act or  omission of any  employee of  the\n\nGovernment  while  acting  within  the  scope  of  his  office or\n\nemployment,  under circumstances  where the  United States,  if a\n\nprivate person,  would be liable  to the  claimant in  accordance\n\nwith the law  of the place where  the act or omission  occurred.\"\n\n28 U.S.C.   1346(b).   However, unlike  a suit against a  private\n\nperson, the Congress has created an administrative procedure that\n\nclaimants must follow  and exhaust.   This  procedure allows  the\n\nagency  involved to  receive  a claim,  investigate, and  perhaps\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nsettle the dispute  before a suit  is filed.   28 U.S.C.    2675.\n\nSection 2675 provides  that \"[a]n action shall  not be instituted\n\nupon a claim against the United  States . . . unless the claimant\n\nshall  have first presented the  claim to the appropriate Federal\n\nagency and his claim shall have been finally denied.\"  The stated\n\nlegislative  purpose of  this administrative prerequisite  was to\n\nbalance the  goal of  efficiently encouraging settlement  between\n\nthe agency and the claimant with  the desire to provide \"fair and\n\nequitable  treatment of  private individuals  and claimants  when\n\nthey  deal with the Government or are involved in litigation with\n\ntheir  Government.\"   S.Rep. No.  1327, 89th  Cong., 2d  Sess. 2,\n\nreprinted in 1966 USCCAN 2515, 2516.\n            \n\n          Section 2675 requires that the potential plaintiff give\n\nnotice to  the  government of  the nature  of the  claim and  the\n\ndamages  requested.   28 U.S.C.    2675(a).1   Failure  to timely\n\n                       \n\n   1Section 2675(a) states:\n\n             (a)  An action  shall not  be instituted\n             upon a  claim against the  United States\n             for money damages for  injury or loss of\n             property  or  personal  injury or  death\n             caused by the  negligent or wrongful act\n             or  omission  of  any  employee  of  the\n             Government while acting within the scope\n             of his office  or employment, unless the\n             claimant shall have first  presented the\n             claim to the agency  in writing and sent\n             by  certified or  registered mail.   The\n             failure  of  an  agency  to  make  final\n             disposition of a claim within six months\n             after it is  filed shall, at the  option\n             of the claimant any time  thereafter, be\n             deemed  a final denial  of the claim for\n             purposes   of   this   section.      The\n             provisions of this subsection  shall not\n             apply to such claims  as may be asserted\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nfile an administrative claim  with the appropriate federal agency\n\nresults in dismissal  of the plaintiff's claim,  since the filing\n\nof  an  administrative  claim  is a  non-waivable  jurisdictional\n\nrequirement.

Only\n                      \n\nafter  the process  of  settlement has  been  initiated does  the\n\nadditional  information  required   by  the  regulations   become\n\nrelevant.   All that  is needed  for notice  is what  the statute\n\nspecifies.\n\n          We understand a plaintiff  to have satisfied the notice\n\nrequirement of section 2675 if he or she provides a claim form or\n\n\"other  written  notification\"   which  includes  (1)  sufficient\n\ninformation for the agency to investigate the claims, and (2) the\n\namount of damages sought.  L pez, 758 F.2d at 809-10  (citing the\n                                \n\nstandard  in Adams,  615 F.2d  at 289,  with approval);  see also\n                                                                 \n\nCorte-Real, 949 F.2d at  485 (claim should not be thrown  out for\n          \n\nfailure to  specify  sum certain  with absolute  clarity).   This\n\ncircuit approaches the notice requirement leniently, \"recognizing\n\nthat individuals wishing to  sue the government must  comply with\n\nthe details of the law, but also keeping in mind that the law was\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nnot  intended to  put up  a barrier  of technicalities  to defeat\n\ntheir claims.\"  L pez, 758  F.2d at 809.  A flexible  approach to\n                     \n\nthe notice  requirement is in  keeping with the  original purpose\n\nbehind the filing  of an administrative  claim: that of  allowing\n\nthe efficient  investigation  of a  claim by  the agency  without\n\nsacrificing the entitlement of a claimant to his or  her cause of\n\naction  against  the government.    This approach  to  the notice\n\nrequirement  recognizes  that  Congress  intended  to  leave  the\n\nultimate choice between settlement  and suit in the hands  of the\n\nclaimant.  GAF Corp., 818 F.2d at 918.  In the context of section\n                    \n\n2675,  the emphasis is on the agency's receipt of information: it\n\nmust  have enough  information  that it  may reasonably  begin an\n\ninvestigation  of  the  claim.2    \"Our  decision  in  Corte-Real\n                                                                 \n\nsupports  saving a claim  that is  flawed, when  the government's\n\ninvestigatory needs  are satisfied.\"   Kokaras v.  United States,\n                                                                \n\nNo. 92-1616, slip op. (1st Cir. Nov. 23, 1992).\n\n          The  district  court   found  that   the  letter   from\n\nappellant's  counsel to  the  Director of  Administration of  the\n\nAAFES failed  to fulfill the requirements of  the statute because\n\nit did not  mention either the  FTCA, negligence or  tort.   This\n\nfailure  to mention the basis  of any potential  claim, the court\n\nfound,  meant that the agency  did not have  sufficient notice of\n\nthe  nature  of the  appellant's  complaint  against the  agency.\n\nHowever,  it  is  clear  that  appellant's  letter  fulfills  the\n\n                       \n\n   2In Corte-Real,  we emphasized  that it was  the information\n                 \n   available  in the notice supplied to the agency, and not the\n   form in which it was presented, that was crucial.\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nstatutory   requirement.     The   letter   provides   sufficient\n\ninformation  to allow the agency  to investigate:   it states the\n\nidentity  of appellant, the date of the incident, the location of\n\nthe incident,  the government  agents involved,  and the type  of\n\ninjury alleged.   It also  states the  amount of the  damages the\n\nappellant is  requesting.   The letter adequately  indicated that\n\nappellant's complaint was premised  on her emotional distress and\n\nmental suffering.  The language put  the agency on notice that it\n\nshould investigate the possibility of potential tortious behavior\n\non  the  part  of  its  agents.     The  fact  that  the   agency\n\nmisunderstood appellant's letter, choosing to interpret it solely\n\nas  a  belated  appeal  of an  adverse  administrative  personnel\n\naction,  should not  prejudice appellant's  suit.   The appellant\n\nsatisfied the statutory requirements  and under the current state\n\nof the law  is not  required to give  any additional  information\n\nunless it is requested.3  \n\n          The  court  has subject  matter  jurisdiction  over the\n\nappellant's claims under the FTCA.  However, appellant's claim is\n\nlimited to the information she included  in the letter.  In other\n\nwords,  she   alone,  and  not   her  husband  or   the  conjugal\n\npartnership, may bring  a claim for damages  up to $50,000.   Nor\n\nare appellant's claims for  reinstatement and back pay cognizable\n\n                       \n\n   3The  court  in L pez  distinguishes  between  the situation\n                        \n   where the agency is simply being given notice of a claim and\n   the situation embodied in  an earlier case, Swift  v. United\n                                                               \n   States, 614 F.2d 812  (1st Cir. 1980), where the  agency, in\n         \n   an attempt to further settlement, requested more information\n   which the claimant ignored.  L pez, 758 F.2d at 810.\n                                     \n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nunder   the  FTCA,   which  provides   only  for   tort  monetary\n\ncompensation.     The  appellant's   claim  is  limited   to  the\n\ninformation  included in the letter which  gave the agency notice\n\nof her claim.\n\nB.  The Intentional Tort Exception to the FTCA\n                                              \n\n          The Federal Tort Claims Act excepts certain intentional\n\ntorts from its general  waiver of sovereign immunity.   28 U.S.C.\n\n  2680.   One of these  exceptions is  \"any claim arising  out of\n\nassault,  battery, false  imprisonment,  false arrest,  malicious\n\nprosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation,\n\ndeceit  or  interference with  contract  rights.\"   28  U.S.C.   \n\n2680(h).    The  district  court correctly  determined  that  the\n\nexceptions  in  28 U.S.C.     2680 are  interpreted  according to\n\nfederal law in order  to avoid any dependence of  federal subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction upon state law.  Hydrogen Technology Corp. v.\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.,  831  F.2d 1155,  1161 (1st  Cir.  1987); United  States v.\n                                                                 \n\nNeustadt,  366 U.S. 696 (1961).   However, while  this might mean\n        \n\nthat  the district court could  properly decide that  a claim for\n\nfalse  imprisonment  or  false  arrest is  precluded  by  section\n\n2680(h), this does  not mean that appellant's  complaint does not\n\ngive rise to another cause of action which is available under the\n\nFTCA.  \n\n          The  appellant's complaint  might  be read  to plead  a\n\ncause  of  action  for  intentional or  negligent  infliction  of\n\nemotional  distress.  There is no exception in section 2680 which\n\ndisallows a  claim for  the infliction of  emotional distress  by\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\ngovernment agents.  Claims against the government for intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress are  not excepted from the FTCA.\n\nSheehan v. United States, 896 F.2d 1168 (9th Cir. 1990).  Nor has\n                        \n\nsuch  an exception been read into the statute.  The Supreme Court\n\nhas taken a very strict approach  to the reading of section 2680.\n\nIt  has held that \"[t]here is  no justification for this Court to\n\nread exemptions into the Act beyond  those provided by Congress.\"\n\nRayonier, Inc. v.  United States, 352 U.S. 315, 321  (1957).  And\n                                \n\neven in the case where the facts of the complaint might give rise\n\nto similar  torts, \"the  partial overlap between  . . .  two tort\n\nactions does not support  the conclusion that if one  is excepted\n\nunder the Tort Claims Act the other  must be as well.\"  Block  v.\n                                                                 \n\nNeal, 460 U.S.  289, 298 (1983).  Therefore, although appellant's\n    \n\nclaim  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  may\n\noverlap with a claim  for false imprisonment, which is  excepted,\n\nit does not follow that the first claim is also excepted.  \n\n                               III.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          Appellant  has adequately  informed  the agency  of her\n\nintention to file  suit for her alleged  harassment by government\n\nagents.   The  dismissal  of appellant's  suit as  excepted under\n\nsection 2680 was premature.  Because the complaint can be read as\n\nstating  a  claim  for  intentional or  negligent  infliction  of\n\nemotional distress, the plaintiff may go forward on that theory. \n\nThe present  disposition is  without prejudice of  further motion\n\ndisposition under Fed.

Lopez  Romo, United  States  Attorney,  was  on brief  for\n                     \nappellees.\n\n                                           \n\n                                           \n\n                   \n\n*Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\n          FUSTE, District Judge.   The main question presented in\n                               \n\nthis appeal is whether appellant properly notified the agency for\n\nwhich she  worked,  the  Army  and Air  Force  Exchange  Service,\n\n(AAFES), of her potential federal tort claim.  The district court\n\nfound  the  letter  sent  to  the  agency by  appellant's  lawyer\n\ndeficient for purposes of  the statutory notice provision of  the\n\nFederal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.   2675(a).  We find that under\n\nthis circuit's  flexible rule  regarding notice  requirements for\n\nfederal tort claims, the letter was sufficient as to part  of the\n\nclaim.\n\n                                I.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Appellant, Lynette Santiago-Ram rez,  was removed  from\n\nher  post at  the  cash register  of  Fort Buchanan's  Army  Post\n\nExchange  store on June 29, 1990, under suspicion of having taken\n\npart in an  employee theft ring.  She was  interrogated for about\n\nforty-five  minutes in  her supervisor's  office.   She  was then\n\ntaken to the office of Mr. Jacques Zayde, the Safety and Security\n\nManager  of  the Exchange,  where she  was  again subjected  to a\n\nforty-five-minute  interrogation.  Appellant  alleges that, among\n\nother  things, she was threatened with  investigation by the FBI.\n\nAfter what  she alleges  was considerable harassment  in complete\n\ndisregard  for her  pregnant condition,  she eventually  signed a\n\ntypewritten  statement.  She was  then returned to  the office of\n\nher supervisor, who  informed her  that she  had been  terminated\n\nfrom her job.  Upon concluding the investigation, no charges were\n\npressed against plaintiff.\n\n          On  September  25, 1990,  appellant's  attorney  sent a\n\nletter to the  Director of Administration  of the AAFES,  stating\n\nthat  appellant  was filing  an  administrative  complaint.   The\n\nletter  specifically mentioned  that appellant was  mistreated by\n\nofficers and agents of the  agency in a manner which  resulted in\n\n\"emotional distress  and mental  suffering.\"  The  letter further\n\nstated the exact  remedy which appellant was  requesting from the\n\nagency:  \"reinstallation of  Mrs. Santiago  to her  position, the\n\npayment of any salaries and benefits and the reinstatement of any\n\nrights she would have earned if not improperly discharged and the\n\namount of $50,000.00.\"   The  agency replied with  a letter  that\n\nindicated it was treating  the case as a routine  dismissal under\n\nmilitary  regulations.   The letter  stated that  \"Ms. Santiago's\n\nrights to reinstatement were  governed by the provisions  of Army\n\nRegulation (AR) 60-21/Air Force  Regulation (AFR) 147-15.\"  These\n\nregulations  require  that an  appeal  of  an adverse  action  be\n\nbrought  within twenty-one  days.   Since appellant's  letter had\n\nbeen sent  after the twenty-one-day period,  the agency indicated\n\nthat  it could  take no  action because  she lacked  a regulatory\n\nbasis for a  review of her complaint.   The agency letter,  while\n\naddressing the reinstatement and  back-pay claim, did not respond\n\nto the claim for damages for emotional distress.  \n\n          After   receiving  this  letter,  appellant  filed  the\n\npresent  suit in the United  States District Court.   She brought\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nsuit  against her  employer,  AAFES,  as  well as  her  immediate\n\nsupervisor, Mayra Moore, and the security manager, Jacques Zayde,\n\nunder the Tucker  Act, 28  U.S.C.   1346(a)(2),  and the  Federal\n\nTort  Claims Act,  28 U.S.C.     1346, 2671-2680.    The district\n\ncourt dismissed the suit after substituting the  United States as\n\nthe proper  party.   The district  court  found that  appellant's\n\nletter did not give  the agency sufficient notice  of appellant's\n\nclaim and that appellant's complaint stated a cause of action for\n\nfalse imprisonment, a cause of action excepted under the statute.\n\n28 U.S.C.   2680(h).  Appellant now appeals the dismissal  of the\n\nclaims under the Federal Tort Claims Act. \n\n                               II.\n\n                     FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT\n                                            \n\nA.  Administrative Requirements of the FTCA\n                                           \n\n          The Federal  Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.    1346,\n\n2671-2680, waives the sovereign immunity of  the United States to\n\nsuits in tort.  The prerequisite for liability under the Act is a\n\n\"negligent or wrongful  act or  omission of any  employee of  the\n\nGovernment  while  acting  within  the  scope  of  his  office or\n\nemployment,  under circumstances  where the  United States,  if a\n\nprivate person,  would be liable  to the  claimant in  accordance\n\nwith the law  of the place where  the act or omission  occurred.\"\n\n28 U.S.C.   1346(b).   However, unlike  a suit against a  private\n\nperson, the Congress has created an administrative procedure that\n\nclaimants must follow  and exhaust.   This  procedure allows  the\n\nagency  involved to  receive  a claim,  investigate, and  perhaps\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nsettle the dispute  before a suit  is filed.   28 U.S.C.    2675.\n\nSection 2675 provides  that \"[a]n action shall  not be instituted\n\nupon a claim against the United  States . . . unless the claimant\n\nshall  have first presented the  claim to the appropriate Federal\n\nagency and his claim shall have been finally denied.\"  The stated\n\nlegislative  purpose of  this administrative prerequisite  was to\n\nbalance the  goal of  efficiently encouraging settlement  between\n\nthe agency and the claimant with  the desire to provide \"fair and\n\nequitable  treatment of  private individuals  and claimants  when\n\nthey  deal with the Government or are involved in litigation with\n\ntheir  Government.\"   S.Rep.

Only\n                      \n\nafter  the process  of  settlement has  been  initiated does  the\n\nadditional  information  required   by  the  regulations   become\n\nrelevant.   All that  is needed  for notice  is what  the statute\n\nspecifies.\n\n          We understand a plaintiff  to have satisfied the notice\n\nrequirement of section 2675 if he or she provides a claim form or\n\n\"other  written  notification\"   which  includes  (1)  sufficient\n\ninformation for the agency to investigate the claims, and (2) the\n\namount of damages sought.  L pez, 758 F.2d at 809-10  (citing the\n                                \n\nstandard  in Adams,  615 F.2d  at 289,  with approval);  see also\n                                                                 \n\nCorte-Real, 949 F.2d at  485 (claim should not be thrown  out for\n          \n\nfailure to  specify  sum certain  with absolute  clarity).   This\n\ncircuit approaches the notice requirement leniently, \"recognizing\n\nthat individuals wishing to  sue the government must  comply with\n\nthe details of the law, but also keeping in mind that the law was\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nnot  intended to  put up  a barrier  of technicalities  to defeat\n\ntheir claims.\"  L pez, 758  F.2d at 809.  A flexible  approach to\n                     \n\nthe notice  requirement is in  keeping with the  original purpose\n\nbehind the filing  of an administrative  claim: that of  allowing\n\nthe efficient  investigation  of a  claim by  the agency  without\n\nsacrificing the entitlement of a claimant to his or  her cause of\n\naction  against  the government.    This approach  to  the notice\n\nrequirement  recognizes  that  Congress  intended  to  leave  the\n\nultimate choice between settlement  and suit in the hands  of the\n\nclaimant.  GAF Corp., 818 F.2d at 918.  In the context of section\n                    \n\n2675,  the emphasis is on the agency's receipt of information: it\n\nmust  have enough  information  that it  may reasonably  begin an\n\ninvestigation  of  the  claim.2    \"Our  decision  in  Corte-Real\n                                                                 \n\nsupports  saving a claim  that is  flawed, when  the government's\n\ninvestigatory needs  are satisfied.\"   Kokaras v.  United States,\n                                                                \n\nNo. 92-1616, slip op. (1st Cir. Nov. 23, 1992).\n\n          The  district  court   found  that   the  letter   from\n\nappellant's  counsel to  the  Director of  Administration of  the\n\nAAFES failed  to fulfill the requirements of  the statute because\n\nit did not  mention either the  FTCA, negligence or  tort.   This\n\nfailure  to mention the basis  of any potential  claim, the court\n\nfound,  meant that the agency  did not have  sufficient notice of\n\nthe  nature  of the  appellant's  complaint  against the  agency.\n\nHowever,  it  is  clear  that  appellant's  letter  fulfills  the\n\n                       \n\n   2In Corte-Real,  we emphasized  that it was  the information\n                 \n   available  in the notice supplied to the agency, and not the\n   form in which it was presented, that was crucial.\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nstatutory   requirement.     The   letter   provides   sufficient\n\ninformation  to allow the agency  to investigate:   it states the\n\nidentity  of appellant, the date of the incident, the location of\n\nthe incident,  the government  agents involved,  and the type  of\n\ninjury alleged.   It also  states the  amount of the  damages the\n\nappellant is  requesting.   The letter adequately  indicated that\n\nappellant's complaint was premised  on her emotional distress and\n\nmental suffering.  The language put  the agency on notice that it\n\nshould investigate the possibility of potential tortious behavior\n\non  the  part  of  its  agents.     The  fact  that  the   agency\n\nmisunderstood appellant's letter, choosing to interpret it solely\n\nas  a  belated  appeal  of an  adverse  administrative  personnel\n\naction,  should not  prejudice appellant's  suit.   The appellant\n\nsatisfied the statutory requirements  and under the current state\n\nof the law  is not  required to give  any additional  information\n\nunless it is requested.3  \n\n          The  court  has subject  matter  jurisdiction  over the\n\nappellant's claims under the FTCA.  However, appellant's claim is\n\nlimited to the information she included  in the letter.  In other\n\nwords,  she   alone,  and  not   her  husband  or   the  conjugal\n\npartnership, may bring  a claim for damages  up to $50,000.   Nor\n\nare appellant's claims for  reinstatement and back pay cognizable\n\n                       \n\n   3The  court  in L pez  distinguishes  between  the situation\n                        \n   where the agency is simply being given notice of a claim and\n   the situation embodied in  an earlier case, Swift  v. United\n                                                               \n   States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"374297\"><a href=\"/opinion/374297/avis-e-swift-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1st Cir. 1980), where the  agency, in\n         \n   an attempt to further settlement, requested more information\n   which the claimant ignored.  L pez, 758 F.2d at 810.\n                                     \n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nunder   the  FTCA,   which  provides   only  for   tort  monetary\n\ncompensation.     The  appellant's   claim  is  limited   to  the\n\ninformation  included in the letter which  gave the agency notice\n\nof her claim.\n\nB.  The Intentional Tort Exception to the FTCA\n                                              \n\n          The Federal Tort Claims Act excepts certain intentional\n\ntorts from its general  waiver of sovereign immunity.   28 U.S.C.\n\n  2680.   One of these  exceptions is  \"any claim arising  out of\n\nassault,  battery, false  imprisonment,  false arrest,  malicious\n\nprosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation,\n\ndeceit  or  interference with  contract  rights.\"   28  U.S.C.   \n\n2680(h).    The  district  court correctly  determined  that  the\n\nexceptions  in  28 U.S.C.     2680 are  interpreted  according to\n\nfederal law in order  to avoid any dependence of  federal subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction upon state law.  Hydrogen Technology Corp. v.\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496586\"><a href=\"/opinion/496586/hydrogen-technology-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1161 (1st  Cir.  1987); United  States v.\n                                                                 \n\nNeustadt,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106257\"><a href=\"/opinion/106257/united-states-v-neustadt/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1961).   However, while  this might mean\n        \n\nthat  the district court could  properly decide that  a claim for\n\nfalse  imprisonment  or  false  arrest is  precluded  by  section\n\n2680(h), this does  not mean that appellant's  complaint does not\n\ngive rise to another cause of action which is available under the\n\nFTCA.  \n\n          The  appellant's complaint  might  be read  to plead  a\n\ncause  of  action  for  intentional or  negligent  infliction  of\n\nemotional  distress.  There is no exception in section 2680 which\n\ndisallows a  claim for  the infliction of  emotional distress  by\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\ngovernment agents.  Claims against the government for intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress are  not excepted from the FTCA.\n\nSheehan v.

Nor has\n                        \n\nsuch  an exception been read into the statute.  The Supreme Court\n\nhas taken a very strict approach  to the reading of section 2680.\n\nIt  has held that \"[t]here is  no justification for this Court to\n\nread exemptions into the Act beyond  those provided by Congress.\"\n\nRayonier, Inc. v.  United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105447\"><a href=\"/opinion/105447/rayonier-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321  (1957).  And\n                                \n\neven in the case where the facts of the complaint might give rise\n\nto similar  torts, \"the  partial overlap between  . . .  two tort\n\nactions does not support  the conclusion that if one  is excepted\n\nunder the Tort Claims Act the other  must be as well.\"  Block  v.\n                                                                 \n\nNeal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110883\"><a href=\"/opinion/110883/block-v-neal/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298 (1983).  Therefore, although appellant's\n    \n\nclaim  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  may\n\noverlap with a claim  for false imprisonment, which is  excepted,\n\nit does not follow that the first claim is also excepted.  \n\n                               III.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          Appellant  has adequately  informed  the agency  of her\n\nintention to file  suit for her alleged  harassment by government\n\nagents.   The  dismissal  of appellant's  suit as  excepted under\n\nsection 2680 was premature.  Because the complaint can be read as\n\nstating  a  claim  for  intentional or  negligent  infliction  of\n\nemotional distress, the plaintiff may go forward on that theory. \n\nThe present  disposition is  without prejudice of  further motion\n\ndisposition under Fed. R. Civ.
