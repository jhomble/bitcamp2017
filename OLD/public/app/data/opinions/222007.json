D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge,\n          and Hon. John H. Rich III, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n            Torruella, Ripple,* and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     John S. Whitman, with whom Richardson, Whitman, Large & Badger\nwas on brief, for appellants.\n     Jeffrey T. Edwards, with whom Preti, Flaherty, Beliveau &\nPachios, LLP was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            July 27, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          LIPEZ,   Circuit   Judge.     This   appeal   requires   us   to\n\ndetermine which of two commercial general liability (CGL) insurance\n\npolicies should be considered \"primary\" for coverage of a claim\n\narising from an accident at a construction site in Portland, Maine.\n\nAt the time of the subject claim, Wright-Ryan Construction, Inc.\n\n(Wright-Ryan) was insured under its own CGL insurance policy,\n\nissued by Acadia Insurance Company (Acadia), and appeared as an\n\n\"Additional Insured\" on a subcontractor's CGL policy, issued by AIG\n\nCommercial Insurance of Canada (AIG). Wright-Ryan and Acadia filed\n\na complaint for a declaratory judgment that AIG was obligated to\n\ndefend Wright-Ryan and for compensation of costs incurred by Acadia\n\nin Wright-Ryan's defense.    On cross-motions for summary judgment,\n\nthe district court granted judgment in AIG's favor, holding that\n\nAcadia's CGL policy provided primary coverage for the accident\n\nclaim, with the AIG policy affording solely excess coverage.\n\n          Appealing from this grant of summary judgment, Wright-\n\nRyan and Acadia contend that the district court erred as a matter\n\nof law in its interpretation of the \"Other Insurance\" clauses of\n\nthe two CGL policies, which govern priority of coverage between\n\noverlapping insurance policies.    According to plaintiffs, a proper\n\nreading of these \"Other Insurance\" clauses dictates that the AIG\n\npolicy be deemed primary.    We agree and therefore reverse.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                                            I.\n\n             The    salient    details       of    this   insurance   dispute    are\n\nuncontested.       Wright-Ryan, a Maine construction company, was hired\n\nby the University of Southern Maine as the general contractor for\n\nthe construction of a building known as University Commons.\n\nWright-Ryan in turn subcontracted with the Canadian company Norgate\n\nMetal,     Inc.    (Norgate)    for    the        fabrication   and   erection    of\n\nstructural steel for the project. Although Wright-Ryan had its own\n\nCGL insurance policy, Wright-Ryan required Norgate, as a condition\n\nof the subcontract, to obtain CGL insurance for the University\n\nCommons project in the amount of $2 million and name Wright-Ryan as\n\nan   additional     insured    on     the    policy.       Norgate    procured   the\n\nrequisite coverage through AIG,1 which issued a certificate of\n\nliability insurance to Wright-Ryan and the University of Southern\n\nMaine     naming   them   \"Additional        Insureds\"     to   Norgate's   policy,\n\nproviding insurance coverage on a primary and non-contributory\n\nbasis for all liability \"arising out of [Norgate's] premises or\n\noperations.\"\n\n             In August 2007, Thomas Behrens, an employee of a company\n\nhired by Norgate to assist with the erection of structural steel,\n\ntripped while dismounting from a ladder at the construction site\n\n\n      1\n       To avoid confusion and as a matter of convenience, we refer\nto Norgate's insurer as AIG throughout the opinion. This shorthand\nobscures the fact that the CGL policy at issue was initially\npurchased from Commerce & Industry Insurance Company of Canada,\nwhom AIG subsequently succeeded in interest.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fand fell through an unguarded stair opening.       Behrens fell four\n\nstories and landed on wet pavement at ground level, suffering\n\nserious injuries.   A little over six months later, Behrens filed\n\nsuit against Wright-Ryan in Maine's Superior Court for negligence\n\nin connection with the accident.     Norgate and Behrens's employer\n\nwere joined as defendants in a later amended complaint.\n\n          Upon receipt of the complaint, Wright-Ryan sent a letter\n\nto Norgate and AIG tendering to them the defense of the Behrens\n\nsuit under Norgate's CGL policy. With no response forthcoming from\n\neither AIG or Norgate, Wright-Ryan's CGL carrier, Acadia, assumed\n\nresponsibility for the company's defense.        Acadia succeeded in\n\nsettling the suit against all three defendants for $150,000 in\n\n2009.\n\n          Wright-Ryan and Acadia filed a complaint for declaratory\n\njudgment against AIG in late 2008 in the federal court for the\n\nDistrict of Maine, seeking a declaration that AIG was obligated to\n\ndefend Wright-Ryan in the Behrens lawsuit. Following settlement of\n\nthe Behrens lawsuit, Wright-Ryan and Acadia amended their complaint\n\nto seek reimbursement for the $150,000 settlement payment and over\n\n$40,000 of attorney's fees incurred in Wright-Ryan's defense.\n\n          The parties each moved for summary judgment, and the\n\nmatter was submitted to a magistrate judge for review.            The\n\nmagistrate   judge's   recommended    decision    reached   two   key\n\nconclusions. First, it concluded that Behrens's accident arose out\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fof Norgate's \"premises or operations,\" and thus Wright-Ryan was\n\nentitled to coverage under Norgate's AIG policy.                  Second, it\n\nconcluded that the AIG policy was excess to Wright-Ryan's Acadia\n\npolicy for purposes of the Behrens claim.               Because the amount\n\nexpended to defend and settle the Behrens suit was well within the\n\nlimits of the Acadia policy -- which the magistrate judge concluded\n\nto be primary coverage for the Behrens claim -- the magistrate\n\njudge   recommended   that     AIG's    motion   for   summary   judgment    be\n\ngranted.   Adopting the magistrate judge's recommended decision in\n\nits entirety, the district court judge entered judgment against\n\nAcadia and Wright-Ryan.\n\n           This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           The issue in this appeal is straightforward. AIG has not\n\nchallenged    the   district    court's      holding   that   Wright-Ryan   is\n\nentitled to coverage for the Behrens claim under its policy.                The\n\nsole and determinative question is whether the district court\n\ncorrectly held Wright-Ryan's Acadia CGL policy to be primary and\n\nthe AIG policy excess. Reviewing the court's legal construction of\n\nthe insurance contracts de novo, see Penn-Am. Ins. Co. v. Lavigne,\n\n617 F.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir. 2010), we arrive at the opposite\n\nconclusion.\n\n           Under Maine law, which the parties agree governs the\n\ninterpretation of the insurance policies here, the \"paramount\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fprinciple in the construction of contracts is to give effect to the\n\nintention of the parties as gathered from the language of the\n\nagreement viewed in the light of all the circumstances under which\n\nit was made.\"      Greenly v. Mariner Mgmt. Group, Inc., 192 F.3d 22,\n\n26 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Whit Shaw Assocs. v. Wardwell, 494 A.2d\n\n1385,   1387   (Me.    1985))   (internal     quotation   marks     omitted).\n\nUnambiguous provisions in insurance contracts, as with any other\n\ncontract, must be interpreted as written, \"giving force to their\n\nplain meaning.\"       Id. (citing   Jack v. Tracy, 722 A.2d 869, 871 (Me.\n\n1999)).      The   mere   fact of a    dispute     over the   meaning     of    a\n\nparticular provision does not render that provision ambiguous; it\n\nwill be so deemed only when an ordinary person would not understand\n\nthat the provision has a single accepted meaning.             Id.\n\n            To untangle the priority of the Acadia and AIG policies,\n\nwe focus on a provision entitled \"Other Insurance,\" present in near\n\nidentical form in both contracts.           These provisions are not unique\n\nto the insurance contracts at issue here.                 \"Other Insurance\"\n\nprovisions are a standard element of liability insurance policies,\n\nintended to govern the relationship between and obligations of\n\ninsurers whose policies provide overlapping coverage for the same\n\nclaim or loss.      See 15 Lee R. Russ & Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on\n\nInsurance § 219:1 (3d ed. 2011).            There is just such an overlap\n\nhere.     Wright-Ryan has coverage for the Behrens claim under both\n\nthe Acadia policy and the AIG policy.            Wright-Ryan is a party to\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fand appears as the Named Insured on the Acadia policy, and, while\n\nnot a party to the AIG policy, Wright-Ryan has been added as an\n\n\"Additional Insured\" to that policy for all liability \"arising out\n\nof [Norgate's] premises or operations.\"                Thus, we look to the\n\npolicies' \"Other Insurance\" provisions to determine which of these\n\ncoverages is primary.\n\n              \"Other Insurance\" provisions typically take one of three\n\nforms: an \"escape\" clause, which completely denies coverage when\n\nother insurance is available; a \"pro rata\" clause, which operates\n\nto share coverage of a claimed loss with other available insurance\n\npolicies; or an \"excess\" clause, which extends coverage for a claim\n\nonly   when    other    insurance   available    for    the   claim   has   been\n\nexhausted.      See Home Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co.,\n\n229 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 2000).        The provisions at issue here are\n\nof the third, \"excess\" variety.        The relevant portions of the two\n\nprovisions read as follows:\n\n                       a.   Primary Insurance\n\n              This insurance is primary         except   when b.,\n              below, applies. . . .\n\n                       b.   Excess Insurance\n\n              This insurance is excess over:\n\n                     (1) Any of the other insurance, whether\n              primary, excess, contingent, or on any other\n              basis . . . (a) That is . . . coverage for\n              \"your work\"; . . .\n\n                     (2) Any other primary insurance\n              available to you covering liability for\n\n                                     -7-\n\f          damages arising out of the premises or\n          operations for which you have been added as an\n          additional insured by attachment of an\n          endorsement.\n\n          When this insurance is excess, we will have no\n          duty . . . to defend the insured against any\n          \"suit\" if any other insurer has a duty to\n          defend the insured against that \"suit\".\n\nThe above language renders the policies excess in two situations:\n\n(1) where there exists another insurance policy covering \"your\n\nwork,\" a term defined in both the AIG and Acadia policies as\n\n\"[w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf\"; and (2)\n\nwhere there exists another liability insurance policy for the\n\npremises or operations that is \"available to you\" and on which \"you\n\nhave been added as an additional insured.\" Inescapably, the key to\n\ninterpreting and applying these provisions is the definition of\n\n\"you.\"\n\n          The parties have given us two choices of definition, each\n\nof which produces a different answer to the priority inquiry.\n\nAppellants Wright-Ryan and Acadia argue that \"you\" means only the\n\n\"Named Insured\" identified in each policy.    Read in this manner,\n\nthe terms of the policies produce complementary results: the Acadia\n\npolicy indicates that its coverage must be excess to AIG's, and the\n\nAIG policy that its coverage is primary.\n\n          Not surprisingly, appellee AIG rejects this reading.   It\n\nchampions instead a broader definition of \"you\" adopted by the\n\ndistrict court, which equates \"you\" with the Named Insured as well\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fas any Additional Insureds added to the respective policies.             AIG\n\nappears to argue, as it did before the district court, that this\n\ncoverage dispute can be resolved merely by plugging the definition\n\nof \"you\" it advocates into the AIG policy, which, thus interpreted,\n\nprovides that its coverage must be excess to the Acadia policy.2\n\n            To resolve this definitional dispute, we begin with the\n\nplain language of the policies.               See Bristol W. Ins. Co. v.\n\nWawanesa Mut. Ins. Co., 570 F.3d 461, 463 (1st Cir. 2009).               The\n\nvery first page of each policy states, \"Throughout this policy the\n\nwords 'you' and 'your' refer to the Named Insured shown in the\n\nDeclarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a\n\nNamed Insured under this policy.\" Turning to the Declarations page\n\nof   the   AIG   policy,   we   find    the    Named   Insured   prominently\n\nidentified, under the header \"Item 1. Named Insured and Address,\"\n\nas Norgate Metal Inc.      No other individual or entity is listed.\n\n\n     2\n        In reality, this is an incomplete argument. Under AIG's\nproposed interpretation of \"you,\" the Acadia policy would also\nindicate that its coverage must be construed as excess to AIG's.\nAIG's reading therefore results in direct conflict between the\nterms of the two policies, as each policy's \"Other Insurance\"\nclause is triggered and requires that its policy be treated as\nexcess over the other. To avoid this sort of \"logical logjam,\"\nwell-established Maine law instructs that the conflicting \"Other\nInsurance\" clauses be disregarded as mutually repugnant. See\nCarriers Ins. Co. v. Am. Policyholders' Ins. Co., 404 A.2d 216, 220\n(Me. 1979). A finding of mutual repugnancy would typically result\nin the two insurers sharing coverage of the claimed loss pro-rata.\nSee Carriers, 404 A.2d at 220.     However, the appellant did not\nargue for mutual repugnancy and request proration below, and thus\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment left AIG with no\nobligation to contribute to the Behrens settlement and costs of\nWright-Ryan's defense.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fLikewise, the Acadia policy's Declarations identify only Wright-\n\nRyan   Construction,      Inc.    and    Wright-Ryan     Real      Estate      LLC   (an\n\nassociated entity with no relation to this lawsuit) as the Named\n\nInsureds.\n\n            The Declarations pages do not themselves define the class\n\nof other \"person[s] or organization[s] qualifying as a Named\n\nInsured\"    who   are    not     specifically       listed   in     the     policies'\n\nDeclarations.     That task is left to Section II of each policy,\n\ndescriptively titled \"WHO IS AN INSURED.\"                    Appearing in near\n\nidentical form in the two policies, Section II provides a roadmap\n\nto   the   insurance     coverage       extended    automatically         to   various\n\nindividuals and entities not expressly listed in the respective\n\npolicies'    Declarations        and    Endorsements.        For    example,         both\n\npolicies    provide     that   the     executive    officers,      directors,        and\n\nemployees of a Named Insured company automatically qualify as\n\n\"insureds,\" though with certain limitations on the scope of their\n\ncoverage.     Relevant to the question here, both policies also\n\nspecify that \"[a]ny organization you newly acquire or form, . . .\n\nand over which you maintain ownership or majority interest, will\n\nqualify as a Named Insured if there is no other similar insurance\n\navailable to that organization.\"                Section II identifies no other\n\npersons or entities who may qualify as a Named Insured, nor is\n\nthere mention of others so qualifying anywhere else throughout the\n\npolicies.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f           Reading these provisions together, we find the definition\n\nof \"you\" to be unambiguous: it refers solely to a person or\n\norganization listed as a Named Insured in the policy Declarations\n\nor \"qualifying as Named Insured\" by virtue of being newly formed or\n\nacquired by a Named Insured.      Where, as here, \"a term is expressly\n\ndefined   within   the   four   corners   of    an   insurance   policy,   an\n\ninquiring court must defer to that definition and thereby give\n\neffect to the intent of the parties.\"          Med. Mut. Ins. Co. of Me. v.\n\nIndian Harbor Ins. Co., 583 F.3d 57, 60 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           The parties have not disclosed the existence of any newly\n\nformed or acquired organizations that might qualify as Named\n\nInsured under the above provision; we must therefore conclude that\n\nthe term \"you\" means solely Norgate in the AIG policy and Wright-\n\nRyan in the Acadia policy.         A substitution of Wright-Ryan and\n\nNorgate for \"you\" in their respective policies readily establishes\n\nthe priority of coverage between the two.            With the substitution,\n\nthe pertinent section of the Acadia policy reads as follows:\n\n           This insurance is excess over:\n\n                  (2) Any other primary insurance\n           available to [Wright-Ryan] covering liability\n           for damages arising out of the premises or\n           operations for which [Wright-Ryan has] been\n           added as an additional insured by attachment\n           of an endorsement.\n\nAs Wright-Ryan has primary insurance under the AIG policy for\n\nliability arising out of Norgate's work at the University Commons\n\nsite, having been added as an Additional Insured on the AIG policy\n\n                                   -11-\n\fby means of an endorsement, the above provision clearly applies.\n\nThe Acadia policy thus requires that it be treated as excess over\n\nthe AIG policy.\n\n          Making the corresponding substitution of Norgate for\n\n\"you\" in the AIG policy, a different result obtains:\n\n          This insurance is excess over:\n\n                 (2) Any other primary insurance\n          available to [Norgate] covering liability for\n          damages arising out of the premises or\n          operations for which [Norgate has] been added\n          as an additional insured by attachment of an\n          endorsement.\n\nOn the record before us, this provision has no application: Norgate\n\nis not an additional insured on the Acadia policy.       Moreover, the\n\nAIG policy unambiguously states that \"[t]his insurance is primary\n\nexcept when\" the excess coverage provisions, including the above,\n\napply.   Reading the two policies together, then, the AIG policy\n\nmust be treated as primary and the Acadia policy as excess.\n\n          Because   we   consider   the   operative   language   of   the\n\ninsurance contracts here to be unambiguous, resort to extrinsic\n\nevidence of the parties' intentions is wholly unnecessary.            Cf.\n\nPine Ridge Realty, Inc. v. Mass. Bay Ins. Co., 752 A.2d 595, 601\n\nn.11 (Me. 2000) (noting that extrinsic evidence may considered\n\nwhere language of insurance contract is ambiguous).       Nonetheless,\n\nwe note that our interpretation is consistent with the design\n\nmanifest in the parties' course of dealing.      Wright-Ryan required\n\nas a condition of its subcontract with Norgate that Norgate procure\n\n                                -12-\n\fCGL insurance and name Wright-Ryan an additional insured on the\n\npolicy.      Wright-Ryan, of course, already had its own CGL insurance\n\npolicy through Acadia; the only plausible explanation for the\n\nsubcontract's insurance requirement would be the desire to shift\n\nthe   risk    to    Norgate   for   liability    arising     out   of   Norgate's\n\nsubcontract work for Wright-Ryan, ensuring that claims related to\n\nthat work were paid out of Norgate's CGL insurance before Wright-\n\nRyan's    was     reached.    This    arrangement      and   the   risk-shifting\n\nmotivation underlying it appear to be typical of subcontracting\n\nrelationships:\n\n              Contracting parties that have required insured\n              status    [under   an    additional    insured\n              endorsement] will want the endorsed policy to\n              respond to their losses on a primary basis,\n              leaving their own general liability insurance\n              limits untouched (or called upon only as\n              excess coverage).\n\n              . . . .\n\n              [T]he CGL policy makes special provisions for\n              coordinating coverages available to these\n              \"endorsed\" additional insureds, reflecting the\n              risk transfer intentions that the named and\n              additional insureds will have -- that is, that\n              additional insured coverage will pay first,\n              before the additional insured['s] . . . own\n              CGL policy is called upon to pay.\n\nW. Jeffrey Woodward et al., Commercial Liability Insurance §\n\nVI.H.1,      14    (2009).    By    giving    effect   to    the   Acadia   \"Other\n\nInsurance\" clause and finding the AIG policy primary, we have no\n\ndoubt that we are properly effectuating the intent of the parties.\n\nSee Greenly, 192 F.3d at 26.\n\n                                       -13-\n\f                                          III.\n\n               Because     the    district      court's         construction      of    the\n\ninsurance contracts here differs so sharply from our own, we\n\nbriefly address the basis for its decision.                       The district court\n\nrelied for its rationale almost exclusively on our decision in\n\nWyner v. North American Specialty Insurance Co., 78 F.3d 752 (1st\n\nCir. 1996), another case in which we had occasion to construe the\n\nterm \"you\" in the context of an insurance policy.                        There, applying\n\nMassachusetts law to interpret a provision excluding coverage for\n\nproperty \"you own, rent or occupy,\" we held \"you\" to include not\n\njust     the     \"Named    Insured\"      but     also     anyone        constituting     an\n\n\"Additional       Insured.\"       Id.    at    755-56.          Because     the   language\n\ndefining \"you\"        in   the    Acadia      and   AIG      policies      is apparently\n\nidentical to the policy language in Wyner, the district court felt,\n\nnot    surprisingly,       that    our    reading       in    Wyner      controlled     the\n\ninterpretation here.\n\n               The relative ease of the interpretive question before us,\n\nalong    with     corroborative,        extrinsic       evidence      of    the   parties'\n\nintent, presents us with no pressing need to look to authority\n\ninterpreting other contracts.              If we were to seek such guidance,\n\nthough, Wyner is neither the sole nor most relevant authority on\n\nthe     point.

These terms are typically defined as\n               referring to the named insured shown in the\n               declarations of the policy, and any other\n               person or organization qualifying as a named\n               insured under the policy. Accordingly, \"you\"\n               and \"your\" do[] not encompass individuals or\n               entities added as an additional insured to the\n               policy.\n\n3   Russ   &    Segalla,   supra,   §    40:26   (footnote   omitted).   The\n\nmainstream of opinions interpreting this or similar definitions has\n\nheld \"you\" to be unambiguous and to refer solely to the individual\n\nor organization identified as the \"Named Insured\" in the policy\n\nDeclarations. See, e.g., Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut.\n\nIns. Co., 234 F. App'x 190, 193 (5th Cir. 2007) (taking \"as a\n\ngiven\" that, under definition of \"you\" identical to the definition\n\nhere, \"you\" was limited to the named insured and did not encompass\n\nan additional insured); Alexander v. Nat'l Fire Ins., 454 F.3d 214,\n\n226-27 (3d Cir. 2006) (same); Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, 300\n\nF.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir. 2002) (holding that definition of \"you\" was\n\nunambiguous and referred only to named insured).\n\n               Numerous factors counsel against looking to Wyner for aid\n\nin interpreting the language here, among them its focus on a\n\ndifferent type of insurance provision (an exclusionary provision),3\n\n\n      3\n       Specifically, the provision at issue in Wyner excluded\ncoverage for property \"you own, rent or occupy.\" 78 F.3d at 755.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fthe dissimilarity of the parties and their contracting intentions\n\n(there, the policy was formed to provide coverage for a tenant and\n\nits landlord), and the rather idiosyncratic posture of the case.4\n\nIndeed, a closer fit can be found in at least two other cases from\n\nthis circuit that have interpreted \"you\" and \"your\" in the precise\n\nfactual setting here: CGL policies obtained by a subcontractor as\n\na condition of work for a general contractor on a construction\n\nproject.    See Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas.\n\nCo., 385 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir. 2004) (interpreting \"your work\" to\n\nrefer to Named Insured subcontractor's work for Additional Insured\n\ngeneral contractor); Merchants Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co.,\n\n143 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1998) (stating that it was \"clear indeed\"\n\nthat \"you\" referred to Named Insured subcontractor). If we had any\n\ndoubt about the proper interpretation of the language here, we\n\nmight    also   find   more   helpful    guidance   in   cases   from   other\n\njurisdictions interpreting \"you\" in the context of an \"Other\n\nInsurance\" provision, as here.          See, e.g., Alexander, 454 F.3d at\n\n226-27 (holding, in interpreting \"Other Insurance\" provision, that\n\n\"you\" means only \"Named Insured,\" and noting that the fact \"[t]hat\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       The typical CGL case involves a third party suing an insured\nfor injury or property damage; this is precisely what CGL insurance\npolicies are meant to cover. Wyner did not fit the typical mold,\nbut involved instead a suit by an insured against its own CGL\npolicy for damage to property it owned, requiring that we consider\nwhether the CGL policy at issue could be read to cover damage\nsuffered by the insured.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fsomeone may be an additional insured does not mean they are a Named\n\nInsured -- the two terms are not interchangeable\").\n\n          Given the weight of the authority interpreting a CGL\n\npolicy's use of the defined term \"you\" in circumstances similar to\n\nours to mean solely the Named Insured, we see no reason to apply\n\nthe interpretation adopted -- on very different facts -- in Wyner.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          Upon careful review, we conclude that the plain language\n\nof the policies at issue here requires the Acadia policy to be\n\ntreated as excess over the AIG policy.   We therefore reverse the\n\njudgment of the district court.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f",

At the time of the subject claim, Wright-Ryan Construction, Inc. (Wright-Ryan) was insured under its own CGL insurance policy, issued by Acadia Insurance Company (Acadia), and appeared as an \"Additional Insured\" on a subcontractor's CGL policy, issued by AIG Commercial Insurance of Canada (AIG). Wright-Ryan and Acadia filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that AIG was obligated to defend Wright-Ryan and for compensation of costs incurred by Acadia in Wright-Ryan's defense. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted judgment in AIG's favor, holding that Acadia's CGL policy provided primary coverage for the accident claim, with the AIG policy affording solely excess coverage.</p>\n<p>Appealing from this grant of summary judgment, Wright-Ryan and Acadia contend that the district court erred as a matter of law in its interpretation of the \"Other Insurance\" clauses of the two CGL policies, which govern priority of coverage between overlapping insurance policies. According to plaintiffs, a proper reading of these \"Other Insurance\" clauses dictates that the AIG policy be deemed primary. We agree and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The salient details of this insurance dispute are uncontested. Wright-Ryan, a Maine construction company, was hired by the University of Southern Maine as the general contractor for the construction of a building known as University Commons. Wright-Ryan in turn subcontracted with the Canadian company Norgate Metal, Inc. (Norgate) for the fabrication and erection of structural steel for the project. Although Wright-Ryan had its own CGL insurance policy, Wright-Ryan required Norgate, as a condition of the subcontract, to obtain CGL insurance for the University Commons project in the amount of $2 million and name Wright-Ryan as an additional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*413</span> insured on the policy. Norgate procured the requisite coverage through AIG,<sup>[1]</sup> which issued a certificate of liability insurance to Wright-Ryan and the University of Southern Maine naming them \"Additional Insureds\" to Norgate's policy, providing insurance coverage on a primary and non-contributory basis for all liability \"arising out of [Norgate's] premises or operations.\"</p>\n<p>In August 2007, Thomas Behrens, an employee of a company hired by Norgate to assist with the erection of structural steel, tripped while dismounting from a ladder at the construction site and fell through an unguarded stair opening. Behrens fell four stories and landed on wet pavement at ground level, suffering serious injuries. A little over six months later, Behrens filed suit against Wright-Ryan in Maine's Superior Court for negligence in connection with the accident. Norgate and Behrens's employer were joined as defendants in a later amended complaint.</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of the complaint, Wright-Ryan sent a letter to Norgate and AIG tendering to them the defense of the Behrens suit under Norgate's CGL policy. With no response forthcoming from either AIG or Norgate, Wright-Ryan's CGL carrier, Acadia, assumed responsibility for the company's defense. Acadia succeeded in settling the suit against all three defendants for $150,000 in 2009.</p>\n<p>Wright-Ryan and Acadia filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against AIG in late 2008 in the federal court for the District of Maine, seeking a declaration that AIG was obligated to defend Wright-Ryan in the Behrens lawsuit. Following settlement of the Behrens lawsuit, Wright-Ryan and Acadia amended their complaint to seek reimbursement for the $150,000 settlement payment and over $40,000 of attorney's fees incurred in Wright-Ryan's defense.</p>\n<p>The parties each moved for summary judgment, and the matter was submitted to a magistrate judge for review. The magistrate judge's recommended decision reached two key conclusions. First, it concluded that Behrens's accident arose out of Norgate's \"premises or operations,\" and thus Wright-Ryan was entitled to coverage under Norgate's AIG policy. Second, it concluded that the AIG policy was excess to Wright-Ryan's Acadia policy for purposes of the Behrens claim. Because the amount expended to defend and settle the Behrens suit was well within the limits of the Acadia policywhich the magistrate judge concluded to be primary coverage for the Behrens claimthe magistrate judge recommended that AIG's motion for summary judgment be granted. Adopting the magistrate judge's recommended decision in its entirety, the district court judge entered judgment against Acadia and Wright-Ryan.</p>\n<p>This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The issue in this appeal is straightforward. AIG has not challenged the district court's holding that Wright-Ryan is entitled to coverage for the Behrens claim under its policy. The sole and determinative question is whether the district court correctly held Wright-Ryan's Acadia CGL policy to be primary and the AIG policy excess. Reviewing the court's legal construction of the insurance contracts de <span class=\"star-pagination\">*414</span> novo, <i>see </i><i>Penn-Am. Ins. Co. v. Lavigne,</i> 617 F.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir.2010), we arrive at the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p>Under Maine law, which the parties agree governs the interpretation of the insurance policies here, the \"paramount principle in the construction of contracts is to give effect to the intention of the parties as gathered from the language of the agreement viewed in the light of all the circumstances under which it was made.\" <i>Greenly v. Mariner Mgmt. Group, Inc.,</i> 192 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>Whit Shaw Assocs. v. Wardwell,</i> 494 A.2d 1385, 1387 (Me.1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Unambiguous provisions in insurance contracts, as with any other contract, must be interpreted as written, \"giving force to their plain meaning.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Jack v. Tracy,</i> 722 A.2d 869, 871 (Me.1999)). The mere fact of a dispute over the meaning of a particular provision does not render that provision ambiguous; it will be so deemed only when an ordinary person would not understand that the provision has a single accepted meaning. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>To untangle the priority of the Acadia and AIG policies, we focus on a provision entitled \"Other Insurance,\" present in near identical form in both contracts. These provisions are not unique to the insurance contracts at issue here. \"Other Insurance\" provisions are a standard element of liability insurance policies, intended to govern the relationship between and obligations of insurers whose policies provide overlapping coverage for the same claim or loss. <i>See</i> 15 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, <i>Couch on Insurance</i> § 219:1 (3d ed. 2011). There is just such an overlap here. Wright-Ryan has coverage for the Behrens claim under both the Acadia policy and the AIG policy. Wright-Ryan is a party to and appears as the Named Insured on the Acadia policy, and, while not a party to the AIG policy, Wright-Ryan has been added as an \"Additional Insured\" to that policy for all liability \"arising out of [Norgate's] premises or operations.\" Thus, we look to the policies' \"Other Insurance\" provisions to determine which of these coverages is primary.</p>\n<p>\"Other Insurance\" provisions typically take one of three forms: an \"escape\" clause, which completely denies coverage when other insurance is available; a \"pro rata\" clause, which operates to share coverage of a claimed loss with other available insurance policies; or an \"excess\" clause, which extends coverage for a claim only when other insurance available for the claim has been exhausted. <i>See </i><i>Home Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 229 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir.2000). The provisions at issue here are of the third, \"excess\" variety. The relevant portions of the two provisions read as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Primary Insurance</h2>\n<blockquote>This insurance is primary except when b., below, applies....</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Excess Insurance</h2>\n<blockquote>This insurance is excess over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) Any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent, or on any other basis ... (a) That is ... coverage for \"your work\"; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Any other primary insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which you have been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty ... to defend the insured against any \"suit\" if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that \"suit\".</blockquote>\n<p>The above language renders the policies excess in two situations: (1) where there exists another insurance policy covering \"your work,\" a term defined in both the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*415</span> AIG and Acadia policies as \"[w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf\"; and (2) where there exists another liability insurance policy for the premises or operations that is \"available to you\" and on which \"you have been added as an additional insured.\" Inescapably, the key to interpreting and applying these provisions is the definition of \"you.\"</p>\n<p>The parties have given us two choices of definition, each of which produces a different answer to the priority inquiry. Appellants Wright-Ryan and Acadia argue that \"you\" means only the \"Named Insured\" identified in each policy. Read in this manner, the terms of the policies produce complementary results: the Acadia policy indicates that its coverage must be excess to AIG's, and the AIG policy that its coverage is primary.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, appellee AIG rejects this reading. It champions instead a broader definition of \"you\" adopted by the district court, which equates \"you\" with the Named Insured as well as any Additional Insureds added to the respective policies. AIG appears to argue, as it did before the district court, that this coverage dispute can be resolved merely by plugging the definition of \"you\" it advocates into the AIG policy, which, thus interpreted, provides that its coverage must be excess to the Acadia policy.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>To resolve this definitional dispute, we begin with the plain language of the policies. <i>See </i><i>Bristol W. Ins. Co. v. Wawanesa Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 570 F.3d 461, 463 (1st Cir. 2009). The very first page of each policy states, \"Throughout this policy the words `you' and `your' refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.\" Turning to the Declarations page of the AIG policy, we find the Named Insured prominently identified, under the header \"Item 1. Named Insured and Address,\" as Norgate Metal Inc. No other individual or entity is listed. Likewise, the Acadia policy's Declarations identify only Wright-Ryan Construction, Inc. and Wright-Ryan Real Estate LLC (an associated entity with no relation to this lawsuit) as the Named Insureds.</p>\n<p>The Declarations pages do not themselves define the class of other \"person[s] or organization[s] qualifying as a Named Insured\" who are not specifically listed in the policies' Declarations. That task is left to Section II of each policy, descriptively titled \"WHO IS AN INSURED.\" Appearing in near identical form in the two policies, Section II provides a roadmap to the insurance coverage extended automatically to various individuals and entities not expressly listed in the respective policies' Declarations and Endorsements. For example, both policies provide that the executive officers, directors, and employees of a Named Insured company automatically qualify as \"insureds,\" though with certain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*416</span> limitations on the scope of their coverage. Relevant to the question here, both policies also specify that \"[a]ny organization you newly acquire or form, ... and over which you maintain ownership or majority interest, will qualify as a Named Insured if there is no other similar insurance available to that organization.\" Section II identifies no other persons or entities who may qualify as a Named Insured, nor is there mention of others so qualifying anywhere else throughout the policies.</p>\n<p>Reading these provisions together, we find the definition of \"you\" to be unambiguous: it refers solely to a person or organization listed as a Named Insured in the policy Declarations or \"qualifying as Named Insured\" by virtue of being newly formed or acquired by a Named Insured. Where, as here, \"a term is expressly defined within the four corners of an insurance policy, an inquiring court must defer to that definition and thereby give effect to the intent of the parties.\" <i>Med. Mut. Ins. Co. of Me. v. Indian Harbor Ins. Co.,</i> 583 F.3d 57, 60 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>The parties have not disclosed the existence of any newly formed or acquired organizations that might qualify as Named Insured under the above provision; we must therefore conclude that the term \"you\" means solely Norgate in the AIG policy and Wright-Ryan in the Acadia policy. A substitution of Wright-Ryan and Norgate for \"you\" in their respective policies readily establishes the priority of coverage between the two. With the substitution, the pertinent section of the Acadia policy reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>This insurance is excess over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Any other primary insurance available to [Wright-Ryan] covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which [Wright-Ryan has] been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.</blockquote>\n<p>As Wright-Ryan has primary insurance under the AIG policy for liability arising out of Norgate's work at the University Commons site, having been added as an Additional Insured on the AIG policy by means of an endorsement, the above provision clearly applies. The Acadia policy thus requires that it be treated as excess over the AIG policy.</p>\n<p>Making the corresponding substitution of Norgate for \"you\" in the AIG policy, a different result obtains:</p>\n<blockquote>This insurance is excess over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Any other primary insurance available to [Norgate] covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which [Norgate has] been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.</blockquote>\n<p>On the record before us, this provision has no application: Norgate is not an additional insured on the Acadia policy. Moreover, the AIG policy unambiguously states that \"[t]his insurance is primary except when\" the excess coverage provisions, including the above, apply. Reading the two policies together, then, the AIG policy must be treated as primary and the Acadia policy as excess.</p>\n<p>Because we consider the operative language of the insurance contracts here to be unambiguous, resort to extrinsic evidence of the parties' intentions is wholly unnecessary. <i>Cf. </i><i>Pine Ridge Realty, Inc. v. Mass. Bay Ins. Co.,</i> 752 A.2d 595, 601 n. 11 (Me.2000) (noting that extrinsic evidence may considered where language of insurance contract is ambiguous). Nonetheless, we note that our interpretation is consistent with the design manifest in the parties' course of dealing. Wright-Ryan required as a condition of its subcontract with Norgate that Norgate procure CGL insurance and name Wright-Ryan an additional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*417</span> insured on the policy. Wright-Ryan, of course, already had its own CGL insurance policy through Acadia; the only plausible explanation for the subcontract's insurance requirement would be the desire to shift the risk to Norgate for liability arising out of Norgate's subcontract work for Wright-Ryan, ensuring that claims related to that work were paid out of Norgate's CGL insurance before Wright-Ryan's was reached. This arrangement and the risk-shifting motivation underlying it appear to be typical of subcontracting relationships:</p>\n<blockquote>Contracting parties that have required insured status [under an additional insured endorsement] will want the endorsed policy to respond to their losses on a primary basis, leaving their own general liability insurance limits untouched (or called upon only as excess coverage).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[T]he CGL policy makes special provisions for coordinating coverages available to these \"endorsed\" additional insureds, reflecting the risk transfer intentions that the named and additional insureds will havethat is, that additional insured coverage will pay first, before the additional insured['s]... own CGL policy is called upon to pay.</blockquote>\n<p>W. Jeffrey Woodward et al., <i>Commercial Liability Insurance</i> § VI.H.1, 14 (2009). By giving effect to the Acadia \"Other Insurance\" clause and finding the AIG policy primary, we have no doubt that we are properly effectuating the intent of the parties. <i>See </i><i>Greenly,</i> 192 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Because the district court's construction of the insurance contracts here differs so sharply from our own, we briefly address the basis for its decision. The district court relied for its rationale almost exclusively on our decision in <i>Wyner v. North American Specialty Insurance Co.,</i> 78 F.3d 752 (1st Cir.1996), another case in which we had occasion to construe the term \"you\" in the context of an insurance policy. There, applying Massachusetts law to interpret a provision excluding coverage for property \"you own, rent or occupy,\" we held \"you\" to include not just the \"Named Insured\" but also anyone constituting an \"Additional Insured.\" <i>Id.</i> at 755-56. Because the language defining \"you\" in the Acadia and AIG policies is apparently identical to the policy language in <i>Wyner,</i> the district court felt, not surprisingly, that our reading in <i>Wyner</i> controlled the interpretation here.</p>\n<p>The relative ease of the interpretive question before us, along with corroborative, extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent, presents us with no pressing need to look to authority interpreting other contracts. If we were to seek such guidance, though, <i>Wyner</i> is neither the sole nor most relevant authority on the point. Decisions interpreting the use of \"you\" and distinguishing between the \"Named Insured\" and \"Additional Insured\" are common, due to the ubiquitous use of those terms in insurance policies:</p>\n<blockquote>Insurance carriers often employ the terms \"you\" and \"your\" throughout the language of a policy. These terms are typically defined as referring to the named insured shown in the declarations of the policy, and any other person or organization qualifying as a named insured under the policy. Accordingly, \"you\" and \"your\" do[] not encompass individuals or entities added as an additional insured to the policy.</blockquote>\n<p>3 Russ &amp; Segalla, <i>supra,</i> § 40:26 (footnote omitted). The mainstream of opinions interpreting this or similar definitions has held \"you\" to be unambiguous and to refer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*418</span> solely to the individual or organization identified as the \"Named Insured\" in the policy Declarations. <i>See, e.g., Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 234 Fed.Appx. 190, 193 (5th Cir.2007) (taking \"as a given\" that, under definition of \"you\" identical to the definition here, \"you\" was limited to the named insured and did not encompass an additional insured); <i>Alexander v. Nat'l Fire Ins.,</i> 454 F.3d 214, 226-27 (3d Cir.2006) (same); <i>Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish,</i> 300 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir.2002) (holding that definition of \"you\" was unambiguous and referred only to named insured).</p>\n<p>Numerous factors counsel against looking to <i>Wyner</i> for aid in interpreting the language here, among them its focus on a different type of insurance provision (an exclusionary provision),<sup>[3]</sup> the dissimilarity of the parties and their contracting intentions (there, the policy was formed to provide coverage for a tenant and its landlord), and the rather idiosyncratic posture of the case.<sup>[4]</sup> Indeed, a closer fit can be found in at least two other cases from this circuit that have interpreted \"you\" and \"your\" in the precise factual setting here: CGL policies obtained by a subcontractor as a condition of work for a general contractor on a construction project. <i>See </i><i>Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co.,</i> 385 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir. 2004) (interpreting \"your work\" to refer to Named Insured subcontractor's work for Additional Insured general contractor); <i>Merchants Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> 143 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1998) (stating that it was \"clear indeed\" that \"you\" referred to Named Insured subcontractor). If we had any doubt about the proper interpretation of the language here, we might also find more helpful guidance in cases from other jurisdictions interpreting \"you\" in the context of an \"Other Insurance\" provision, as here. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Alexander,</i> 454 F.3d at 226-27 (holding, in interpreting \"Other Insurance\" provision, that \"you\" means only \"Named Insured,\" and noting that the fact \"[t]hat someone may be an additional insured does not mean they are a Named Insuredthe two terms are not interchangeable\").</p>\n<p>Given the weight of the authority interpreting a CGL policy's use of the defined term \"you\" in circumstances similar to ours to mean solely the Named Insured, we see no reason to apply the interpretation adoptedon very different factsin <i>Wyner.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Upon careful review, we conclude that the plain language of the policies at issue here requires the Acadia policy to be treated as excess over the AIG policy. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  To avoid confusion and as a matter of convenience, we refer to Norgate's insurer as AIG throughout the opinion. This shorthand obscures the fact that the CGL policy at issue was initially purchased from Commerce &amp; Industry Insurance Company of Canada, whom AIG subsequently succeeded in interest.</p>\n<p>[2]  In reality, this is an incomplete argument. Under AIG's proposed interpretation of \"you,\" the Acadia policy would <i>also</i> indicate that its coverage must be construed as excess to AIG's. AIG's reading therefore results in direct conflict between the terms of the two policies, as each policy's \"Other Insurance\" clause is triggered and requires that its policy be treated as excess over the other. To avoid this sort of \"logical logjam,\" well-established Maine law instructs that the conflicting \"Other Insurance\" clauses be disregarded as mutually repugnant. <i>See </i><i>Carriers Ins. Co. v. Am. Policyholders' Ins. Co.,</i> 404 A.2d 216, 220 (Me. 1979). A finding of mutual repugnancy would typically result in the two insurers sharing coverage of the claimed loss pro-rata. <i>See </i><i>Carriers,</i> 404 A.2d at 220. However, the appellant did not argue for mutual repugnancy and request proration below, and thus the district court's grant of summary judgment left AIG with no obligation to contribute to the Behrens settlement and costs of Wright-Ryan's defense.</p>\n<p>[3]  Specifically, the provision at issue in <i>Wyner</i> excluded coverage for property \"you own, rent or occupy.\" 78 F.3d at 755.</p>\n<p>[4]  The typical CGL case involves a third party suing an insured for injury or property damage; this is precisely what CGL insurance policies are meant to cover. <i>Wyner</i> did not fit the typical mold, but involved instead a suit by an insured against <i>its own</i> CGL policy for damage to property it owned, requiring that we consider whether the CGL policy at issue could be read to cover damage suffered by the insured.</p>\n\n</div>",

At the time of the subject claim, Wright-Ryan Construction, Inc. (Wright-Ryan) was insured under its own CGL insurance policy, issued by Acadia Insurance Company (Acadia), and appeared as an \"Additional Insured\" on a subcontractor's CGL policy, issued by AIG Commercial Insurance of Canada (AIG). Wright-Ryan and Acadia filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that AIG was obligated to defend Wright-Ryan and for compensation of costs incurred by Acadia in Wright-Ryan's defense. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted judgment in AIG's favor, holding that Acadia's CGL policy provided primary coverage for the accident claim, with the AIG policy affording solely excess coverage.</p>\n<p>Appealing from this grant of summary judgment, Wright-Ryan and Acadia contend that the district court erred as a matter of law in its interpretation of the \"Other Insurance\" clauses of the two CGL policies, which govern priority of coverage between overlapping insurance policies. According to plaintiffs, a proper reading of these \"Other Insurance\" clauses dictates that the AIG policy be deemed primary. We agree and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The salient details of this insurance dispute are uncontested. Wright-Ryan, a Maine construction company, was hired by the University of Southern Maine as the general contractor for the construction of a building known as University Commons. Wright-Ryan in turn subcontracted with the Canadian company Norgate Metal, Inc. (Norgate) for the fabrication and erection of structural steel for the project. Although Wright-Ryan had its own CGL insurance policy, Wright-Ryan required Norgate, as a condition of the subcontract, to obtain CGL insurance for the University Commons project in the amount of $2 million and name Wright-Ryan as an additional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*413</span> insured on the policy. Norgate procured the requisite coverage through AIG,<sup>[1]</sup> which issued a certificate of liability insurance to Wright-Ryan and the University of Southern Maine naming them \"Additional Insureds\" to Norgate's policy, providing insurance coverage on a primary and non-contributory basis for all liability \"arising out of [Norgate's] premises or operations.\"</p>\n<p>In August 2007, Thomas Behrens, an employee of a company hired by Norgate to assist with the erection of structural steel, tripped while dismounting from a ladder at the construction site and fell through an unguarded stair opening. Behrens fell four stories and landed on wet pavement at ground level, suffering serious injuries. A little over six months later, Behrens filed suit against Wright-Ryan in Maine's Superior Court for negligence in connection with the accident. Norgate and Behrens's employer were joined as defendants in a later amended complaint.</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of the complaint, Wright-Ryan sent a letter to Norgate and AIG tendering to them the defense of the Behrens suit under Norgate's CGL policy. With no response forthcoming from either AIG or Norgate, Wright-Ryan's CGL carrier, Acadia, assumed responsibility for the company's defense. Acadia succeeded in settling the suit against all three defendants for $150,000 in 2009.</p>\n<p>Wright-Ryan and Acadia filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against AIG in late 2008 in the federal court for the District of Maine, seeking a declaration that AIG was obligated to defend Wright-Ryan in the Behrens lawsuit. Following settlement of the Behrens lawsuit, Wright-Ryan and Acadia amended their complaint to seek reimbursement for the $150,000 settlement payment and over $40,000 of attorney's fees incurred in Wright-Ryan's defense.</p>\n<p>The parties each moved for summary judgment, and the matter was submitted to a magistrate judge for review. The magistrate judge's recommended decision reached two key conclusions. First, it concluded that Behrens's accident arose out of Norgate's \"premises or operations,\" and thus Wright-Ryan was entitled to coverage under Norgate's AIG policy. Second, it concluded that the AIG policy was excess to Wright-Ryan's Acadia policy for purposes of the Behrens claim. Because the amount expended to defend and settle the Behrens suit was well within the limits of the Acadia policywhich the magistrate judge concluded to be primary coverage for the Behrens claimthe magistrate judge recommended that AIG's motion for summary judgment be granted. Adopting the magistrate judge's recommended decision in its entirety, the district court judge entered judgment against Acadia and Wright-Ryan.</p>\n<p>This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The issue in this appeal is straightforward. AIG has not challenged the district court's holding that Wright-Ryan is entitled to coverage for the Behrens claim under its policy. The sole and determinative question is whether the district court correctly held Wright-Ryan's Acadia CGL policy to be primary and the AIG policy excess. Reviewing the court's legal construction of the insurance contracts de <span class=\"star-pagination\">*414</span> novo, <i>see </i><i>Penn-Am. Ins. Co. v. Lavigne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"173954\"><a href=\"/opinion/173954/penn-america-ins-co-v-lavigne/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2010), we arrive at the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p>Under Maine law, which the parties agree governs the interpretation of the insurance policies here, the \"paramount principle in the construction of contracts is to give effect to the intention of the parties as gathered from the language of the agreement viewed in the light of all the circumstances under which it was made.\" <i>Greenly v. Mariner Mgmt. Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198646\"><a href=\"/opinion/198646/greenly-v-mariner-management/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>Whit Shaw Assocs. v. Wardwell,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1385</span></span>, 1387 (Me.1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Unambiguous provisions in insurance contracts, as with any other contract, must be interpreted as written, \"giving force to their plain meaning.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Jack v. Tracy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></span>, 871 (Me.1999)). The mere fact of a dispute over the meaning of a particular provision does not render that provision ambiguous; it will be so deemed only when an ordinary person would not understand that the provision has a single accepted meaning. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>To untangle the priority of the Acadia and AIG policies, we focus on a provision entitled \"Other Insurance,\" present in near identical form in both contracts. These provisions are not unique to the insurance contracts at issue here. \"Other Insurance\" provisions are a standard element of liability insurance policies, intended to govern the relationship between and obligations of insurers whose policies provide overlapping coverage for the same claim or loss. <i>See</i> 15 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, <i>Couch on Insurance</i> § 219:1 (3d ed. 2011). There is just such an overlap here. Wright-Ryan has coverage for the Behrens claim under both the Acadia policy and the AIG policy. Wright-Ryan is a party to and appears as the Named Insured on the Acadia policy, and, while not a party to the AIG policy, Wright-Ryan has been added as an \"Additional Insured\" to that policy for all liability \"arising out of [Norgate's] premises or operations.\" Thus, we look to the policies' \"Other Insurance\" provisions to determine which of these coverages is primary.</p>\n<p>\"Other Insurance\" provisions typically take one of three forms: an \"escape\" clause, which completely denies coverage when other insurance is available; a \"pro rata\" clause, which operates to share coverage of a claimed loss with other available insurance policies; or an \"excess\" clause, which extends coverage for a claim only when other insurance available for the claim has been exhausted. <i>See </i><i>Home Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199123\"><a href=\"/opinion/199123/home-insurance-v-st-paul-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 61 (1st Cir.2000). The provisions at issue here are of the third, \"excess\" variety. The relevant portions of the two provisions read as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Primary Insurance</h2>\n<blockquote>This insurance is primary except when b., below, applies....</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Excess Insurance</h2>\n<blockquote>This insurance is excess over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) Any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent, or on any other basis ... (a) That is ... coverage for \"your work\"; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Any other primary insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which you have been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty ... to defend the insured against any \"suit\" if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that \"suit\".</blockquote>\n<p>The above language renders the policies excess in two situations: (1) where there exists another insurance policy covering \"your work,\" a term defined in both the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*415</span> AIG and Acadia policies as \"[w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf\"; and (2) where there exists another liability insurance policy for the premises or operations that is \"available to you\" and on which \"you have been added as an additional insured.\" Inescapably, the key to interpreting and applying these provisions is the definition of \"you.\"</p>\n<p>The parties have given us two choices of definition, each of which produces a different answer to the priority inquiry. Appellants Wright-Ryan and Acadia argue that \"you\" means only the \"Named Insured\" identified in each policy. Read in this manner, the terms of the policies produce complementary results: the Acadia policy indicates that its coverage must be excess to AIG's, and the AIG policy that its coverage is primary.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, appellee AIG rejects this reading. It champions instead a broader definition of \"you\" adopted by the district court, which equates \"you\" with the Named Insured as well as any Additional Insureds added to the respective policies. AIG appears to argue, as it did before the district court, that this coverage dispute can be resolved merely by plugging the definition of \"you\" it advocates into the AIG policy, which, thus interpreted, provides that its coverage must be excess to the Acadia policy.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>To resolve this definitional dispute, we begin with the plain language of the policies. <i>See </i><i>Bristol W. Ins. Co. v. Wawanesa Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></span>, 463 (1st Cir. 2009). The very first page of each policy states, \"Throughout this policy the words `you' and `your' refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy.\" Turning to the Declarations page of the AIG policy, we find the Named Insured prominently identified, under the header \"Item 1. Named Insured and Address,\" as Norgate Metal Inc. No other individual or entity is listed. Likewise, the Acadia policy's Declarations identify only Wright-Ryan Construction, Inc. and Wright-Ryan Real Estate LLC (an associated entity with no relation to this lawsuit) as the Named Insureds.</p>\n<p>The Declarations pages do not themselves define the class of other \"person[s] or organization[s] qualifying as a Named Insured\" who are not specifically listed in the policies' Declarations. That task is left to Section II of each policy, descriptively titled \"WHO IS AN INSURED.\" Appearing in near identical form in the two policies, Section II provides a roadmap to the insurance coverage extended automatically to various individuals and entities not expressly listed in the respective policies' Declarations and Endorsements. For example, both policies provide that the executive officers, directors, and employees of a Named Insured company automatically qualify as \"insureds,\" though with certain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*416</span> limitations on the scope of their coverage. Relevant to the question here, both policies also specify that \"[a]ny organization you newly acquire or form, ... and over which you maintain ownership or majority interest, will qualify as a Named Insured if there is no other similar insurance available to that organization.\" Section II identifies no other persons or entities who may qualify as a Named Insured, nor is there mention of others so qualifying anywhere else throughout the policies.</p>\n<p>Reading these provisions together, we find the definition of \"you\" to be unambiguous: it refers solely to a person or organization listed as a Named Insured in the policy Declarations or \"qualifying as Named Insured\" by virtue of being newly formed or acquired by a Named Insured. Where, as here, \"a term is expressly defined within the four corners of an insurance policy, an inquiring court must defer to that definition and thereby give effect to the intent of the parties.\" <i>Med. Mut. Ins. Co. of Me. v. Indian Harbor Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204032\"><a href=\"/opinion/204032/medical-mut-ins-co-of-maine-v-indian-harbor/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>The parties have not disclosed the existence of any newly formed or acquired organizations that might qualify as Named Insured under the above provision; we must therefore conclude that the term \"you\" means solely Norgate in the AIG policy and Wright-Ryan in the Acadia policy. A substitution of Wright-Ryan and Norgate for \"you\" in their respective policies readily establishes the priority of coverage between the two. With the substitution, the pertinent section of the Acadia policy reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>This insurance is excess over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Any other primary insurance available to [Wright-Ryan] covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which [Wright-Ryan has] been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.</blockquote>\n<p>As Wright-Ryan has primary insurance under the AIG policy for liability arising out of Norgate's work at the University Commons site, having been added as an Additional Insured on the AIG policy by means of an endorsement, the above provision clearly applies. The Acadia policy thus requires that it be treated as excess over the AIG policy.</p>\n<p>Making the corresponding substitution of Norgate for \"you\" in the AIG policy, a different result obtains:</p>\n<blockquote>This insurance is excess over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Any other primary insurance available to [Norgate] covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which [Norgate has] been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.</blockquote>\n<p>On the record before us, this provision has no application: Norgate is not an additional insured on the Acadia policy. Moreover, the AIG policy unambiguously states that \"[t]his insurance is primary except when\" the excess coverage provisions, including the above, apply. Reading the two policies together, then, the AIG policy must be treated as primary and the Acadia policy as excess.</p>\n<p>Because we consider the operative language of the insurance contracts here to be unambiguous, resort to extrinsic evidence of the parties' intentions is wholly unnecessary. <i>Cf. </i><i>Pine Ridge Realty, Inc. v. Mass. Bay Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></span>, 601 n. 11 (Me.2000) (noting that extrinsic evidence may considered where language of insurance contract is ambiguous). Nonetheless, we note that our interpretation is consistent with the design manifest in the parties' course of dealing. Wright-Ryan required as a condition of its subcontract with Norgate that Norgate procure CGL insurance and name Wright-Ryan an additional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*417</span> insured on the policy. Wright-Ryan, of course, already had its own CGL insurance policy through Acadia; the only plausible explanation for the subcontract's insurance requirement would be the desire to shift the risk to Norgate for liability arising out of Norgate's subcontract work for Wright-Ryan, ensuring that claims related to that work were paid out of Norgate's CGL insurance before Wright-Ryan's was reached. This arrangement and the risk-shifting motivation underlying it appear to be typical of subcontracting relationships:</p>\n<blockquote>Contracting parties that have required insured status [under an additional insured endorsement] will want the endorsed policy to respond to their losses on a primary basis, leaving their own general liability insurance limits untouched (or called upon only as excess coverage).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[T]he CGL policy makes special provisions for coordinating coverages available to these \"endorsed\" additional insureds, reflecting the risk transfer intentions that the named and additional insureds will havethat is, that additional insured coverage will pay first, before the additional insured['s]... own CGL policy is called upon to pay.</blockquote>\n<p>W. Jeffrey Woodward et al., <i>Commercial Liability Insurance</i> § VI.H.1, 14 (2009). By giving effect to the Acadia \"Other Insurance\" clause and finding the AIG policy primary, we have no doubt that we are properly effectuating the intent of the parties. <i>See </i><i>Greenly,</i> 192 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Because the district court's construction of the insurance contracts here differs so sharply from our own, we briefly address the basis for its decision. The district court relied for its rationale almost exclusively on our decision in <i>Wyner v. North American Specialty Insurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196642\"><a href=\"/opinion/196642/wyner-v-north-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996), another case in which we had occasion to construe the term \"you\" in the context of an insurance policy. There, applying Massachusetts law to interpret a provision excluding coverage for property \"you own, rent or occupy,\" we held \"you\" to include not just the \"Named Insured\" but also anyone constituting an \"Additional Insured.\" <i>Id.</i> at 755-56. Because the language defining \"you\" in the Acadia and AIG policies is apparently identical to the policy language in <i>Wyner,</i> the district court felt, not surprisingly, that our reading in <i>Wyner</i> controlled the interpretation here.</p>\n<p>The relative ease of the interpretive question before us, along with corroborative, extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent, presents us with no pressing need to look to authority interpreting other contracts. If we were to seek such guidance, though, <i>Wyner</i> is neither the sole nor most relevant authority on the point. Decisions interpreting the use of \"you\" and distinguishing between the \"Named Insured\" and \"Additional Insured\" are common, due to the ubiquitous use of those terms in insurance policies:</p>\n<blockquote>Insurance carriers often employ the terms \"you\" and \"your\" throughout the language of a policy. These terms are typically defined as referring to the named insured shown in the declarations of the policy, and any other person or organization qualifying as a named insured under the policy. Accordingly, \"you\" and \"your\" do[] not encompass individuals or entities added as an additional insured to the policy.</blockquote>\n<p>3 Russ &amp; Segalla, <i>supra,</i> § 40:26 (footnote omitted). The mainstream of opinions interpreting this or similar definitions has held \"you\" to be unambiguous and to refer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*418</span> solely to the individual or organization identified as the \"Named Insured\" in the policy Declarations. <i>See, e.g., Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 234 Fed.Appx. 190, 193 (5th Cir.2007) (taking \"as a given\" that, under definition of \"you\" identical to the definition here, \"you\" was limited to the named insured and did not encompass an additional insured); <i>Alexander v.

Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201258\"><a href=\"/opinion/201258/national-union-fire-v-lumbermens-mutual/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir. 2004) (interpreting \"your work\" to refer to Named Insured subcontractor's work for Additional Insured general contractor); <i>Merchants Ins.

If we had any doubt about the proper interpretation of the language here, we might also find more helpful guidance in cases from other jurisdictions interpreting \"you\" in the context of an \"Other Insurance\" provision, as here. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Alexander,</i> 454 F.3d at 226-27 (holding, in interpreting \"Other Insurance\" provision, that \"you\" means only \"Named Insured,\" and noting that the fact \"[t]hat someone may be an additional insured does not mean they are a Named Insuredthe two terms are not interchangeable\").</p>\n<p>Given the weight of the authority interpreting a CGL policy's use of the defined term \"you\" in circumstances similar to ours to mean solely the Named Insured, we see no reason to apply the interpretation adoptedon very different factsin <i>Wyner.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Upon careful review, we conclude that the plain language of the policies at issue here requires the Acadia policy to be treated as excess over the AIG policy.

Under AIG's proposed interpretation of \"you,\" the Acadia policy would <i>also</i> indicate that its coverage must be construed as excess to AIG's. AIG's reading therefore results in direct conflict between the terms of the two policies, as each policy's \"Other Insurance\" clause is triggered and requires that its policy be treated as excess over the other. To avoid this sort of \"logical logjam,\" well-established Maine law instructs that the conflicting \"Other Insurance\" clauses be disregarded as mutually repugnant. <i>See </i><i>Carriers Ins. Co. v. Am. Policyholders' Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></span>, 220 (Me. 1979). A finding of mutual repugnancy would typically result in the two insurers sharing coverage of the claimed loss pro-rata. <i>See </i><i>Carriers,</i> 404 A.2d at 220. However, the appellant did not argue for mutual repugnancy and request proration below, and thus the district court's grant of summary judgment left AIG with no obligation to contribute to the Behrens settlement and costs of Wright-Ryan's defense.</p>\n<p>[3]  Specifically, the provision at issue in <i>Wyner</i> excluded coverage for property \"you own, rent or occupy.\" 78 F.3d at 755.</p>\n<p>[4]  The typical CGL case involves a third party suing an insured for injury or property damage; this is precisely what CGL insurance policies are meant to cover. <i>Wyner</i> did not fit the typical mold, but involved instead a suit by an insured against <i>its own</i> CGL policy for damage to property it owned, requiring that we consider whether the CGL policy at issue could be read to cover damage suffered by the insured.</p>\n\n</div>",
