The Westfall Act provides a\n                             \n\nfederal employee with immunity from an ordinary tort suit if\n                                                            \n\nthe  suit arises out of acts performed \"within the scope of\"\n\nthe  defendant  employee's  \"office  or  employment.\"    The\n\nimmunity attaches  when the Attorney General  files with the\n\ncourt a certificate stating that\n\n          the defendant employee was acting within\n                                           \n          the scope of his office or employment at\n                                                  \n          the  time of  the incident out  of which\n                                                  \n          the claim arose.\n                          \n\n28 U.S.C.    2679(d)(1) (emphasis added).   Upon filing this\n\ncertificate,  the Attorney  General can  remove the  case to\n\nfederal court (if it started in state court), substitute the\n\nUnited States as defendant,  and, effectively, immunize  the\n\nemployee from any personal liability.  28 U.S.C.   2679(d).\n\n          This   appeal  focuses  on  whether  the  Attorney\n\nGeneral  may issue  a Westfall  Act certificate  that simply\n\ndenies that  any injury-causing action occurred.   Suppose a\n\nplaintiff  claims that  a  federal employee  committed  acts\n\nclearly outside the scope of  employment, as here, where the\n\nplaintiff  has   alleged  sexual  harassment   amounting  to\n\n\"assault  and battery.\"   Can  the Attorney  General certify\n\nthat  there  simply was  no such  event?   To  rephrase this\n\nquestion using the statutory terms underlined above: Can the\n\ncertificate grant immunity simply by denying  the occurrence\n\n                            -4-\n\nof any \"incident out of which  the claim arose?\"  Would such\n\na certificate fall within the scope of the immunity statute?\n\n          The  legal question  is  important,  for, where  a\n\nplaintiff alleges a serious intentional tort, say assault or\n\nrape, and also presents enough evidence to survive a summary\n\njudgment  motion, the  answer  will affect  the  plaintiff's\n\nright  to a  jury  trial.   A  \"yes\" answer  means  that the\n\nAttorney  General  and  the   trial  judge  (reviewing   the\n\ncertificate) will decide whether  or not the alleged assault\n\noccurred.  A  \"no\" answer reserves the basic  factual issues\n\nfor a  jury, in effect, maintaining  the plaintiff's Seventh\n\nAmendment right to a trial by jury in \"Suits at common law.\"\n\nU.S. Const. amend. VII. \n\n          In our view, the answer is \"no.\"  This \"no\" answer\n\nfinds support in the  statutory language, read together with\n\nrelated  provisions; the  legislative history;  the relevant\n\ncase  law  background;  and   direct  precedent  from  other\n\ncircuits.  We find nothing to suggest that Congress intended\n\na  contrary result.  We therefore conclude that the Westfall\n\nAct certificate  cannot deny the  basic \"incident\"  charged,\n\nthough  (as we  shall explain in  Part III)  the certificate\n\nneed  not accept  the  plaintiff's version  of  just how  it\n                                                        \n\n                            -5-\n\noccurred.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          Theresa  Wood, the plaintiff,  worked as secretary\n\nto the  federal employee  defendant, Charles Owens,  an Army\n\nMajor.   She  filed a  federal court  complaint  against the\n\nUnited States and Major Owens.   The complaint alleges  that\n\nin October 1987 Major Owens told Mrs. Wood that he wanted to\n\ngo to a  hotel with her;  that later in  1987 he called  her\n\ninto  his office, \"grabbed  her arm, pulled  her toward him,\n\ncaressed her arm,  took lint  from her blouse  and said,  'I\n\nlike you, I like you  a lot and I  want to be intimate  with\n\nyou;'\" that in January 1988, he told her that he \"would like\n\nto have a relationship  together -- a sexual one;\"  and that\n\nin February 1988 he told her that she was not  right for the\n\njob  and would have to  leave.  Eventually,  for reasons not\n\nhere relevant,  the district  court dismissed  the complaint\n\ninsofar as it  charged violations  by the  United States  of\n\nvarious  specified provisions of federal and state law.  The\n\ncomplaint,  however,  also set  forth  state  law claims  of\n\nassault and  battery, and  civil  rights violations  against\n\nMajor Owens.  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 12,   11I.  The district\n                 \n\n                            -6-\n\ncourt  did not dismiss these state law claims, over which it\n\nretained diversity jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C.   1332.\n\n          The United States Attorney then filed (in what had\n\nbecome  a  state  law,  diversity  action)  a  Westfall  Act\n\ncertificate.   See  28  C.F.R.    15.3 (delegating  Attorney\n                  \n\nGeneral's  certification  authority  to  the  United  States\n\nAttorney).   It said that Owens, \"at all times referenced in\n\nthe  . . . Complaint,\"  was \"acting within  the scope of his\n\noffice  as a commissioned officer of the Armed forces of the\n\nUnited States.\"  In  an accompanying affidavit, Owens simply\n\ndenied Wood's factual allegations.  He said,\n\n          I never  spoke in a  sexually suggestive\n          manner  to plaintiff  nor did  I  at any\n          time ever proposition or  otherwise make\n          any sexual advances towards plaintiff.\n\nThe  United  States  Attorney,  denying  that  any  relevant\n\nincident  had occurred,  asked the  court to  substitute the\n\nUnited  States   for  Owens   as  defendant,  28   U.S.C.   \n\n2679(d)(1),  and (because  of  federal preemption  of  state\n\ncivil  rights law  and  a special  law preserving  sovereign\n\nimmunity  for intentional  torts) to  dismiss  the resulting\n\nclaims against the United States.  See 42 U.S.C.   2000e-16;\n                                      \n\n28 U.S.C.   2680(h).\n\n          The   district   court   would  not   permit   the\n\nsubstitution   because  it   believed   the   Westfall   Act\n\n                            -7-\n\ncertificate  was  inadequate.    It  pointed  out  that  the\n\ncomplaint  alleged facts,  which  (if  true)  showed  Owens'\n                  \n\nactions fell  outside his  \"scope of office  or employment.\"\n\nSee  28  U.S.C.     2671  (defining  \"scope  of  office   or\n   \n\nemployment\" to  mean a  military officer's \"line  of duty\");\n\nLutz v.

And,\n      \n\nthe court added, the  government did not deny that  the acts\n\nwould have fallen outside the \"scope of employment\" had they\n\noccurred.\n\n          On  appeal, a  panel  of this  court affirmed  the\n\ndistrict court, for  similar reasons.  Sitting  en banc, we,\n\ntoo,  affirm  the district  court's  determination, but  for\n\nsomewhat different reasons.\n\n                            -8-\n\n                             II\n\n                   Denying the \"Incident\"\n                                         \n\n          Congress  did not  directly consider  the question\n\nbefore  us:     whether   or  not  the   Attorney  General's\n\ncertificate can simply  deny that  any \"incident\"  occurred.\n\nThe  statute's language,  history,  and precedent,  however,\n\nconvince us that the  certificate cannot deny the occurrence\n\nof the basic incident charged.\n\n                             A\n\n                     The Statute Itself\n                                       \n\n          1.   The  Provision's Language.   The Westfall Act\n                                        \n\nitself says that, to  provide immunity, the Attorney General\n\nmust certify that the  defendant employee was \"acting within\n                                                     \n\nthe scope  of his  office or employment  at the time  of the\n                                                            \n\nincident  out  of  which  the  claim  arose.\"     28  U.S.C.\n        \n\n  2679(d)(1).   The dissent reads these  words as permitting\n\nthe  Attorney General  to  obtain immunity  for any  alleged\n                                                   \n\nworking-hour tort  simply by  denying that  anything unusual\n\noccurred \"at the time.\"  But, it seems to us more natural to\n                     \n\nread these  words as speaking of  an action \"at the  time of\n                                                            \n\nthe  incident,\"  thus  assuming  some  kind  of   \"incident\"\n             \n\noccurred.\n\n          After all, the basic point of immunity doctrine is\n\n                            -9-\n\nto provide  government employees with a  defense for conduct\n\nthat  falls into  certain categories.    See, e.g.,  Barr v.\n                                                         \n\nMatteo, 360  U.S. 564,  573-74 (1959); Mitchell  v. Forsyth,\n                                                           \n\n472  U.S. 511,  525 (1985); Harlow  v. Fitzgerald,  457 U.S.\n                                                 \n\n800, 818 (1982).  The doctrine normally comes into play, not\n\nwhen the defendant denies the conduct charged, but  when the\n\ndefendant asks  a court  to characterize  the conduct.   The\n                                        \n\npoint   of   the   certificate   is   to   assert   such   a\n\ncharacterization,  namely to  claim  that a  (hypothetically\n\nconceded) \"incident\" involved activity  that was \"within the\n\nscope of employment.\"\n\n          2.   The  Statutory  Scheme.     The   surrounding\n                                     \n\nstatutory provisions  support  our natural  reading  of  the\n\nprovision's language, for they reveal that Congress intended\n\nthe  Westfall  Act  to  immunize employees  from  claims  of\n\nwrongdoing of a particular type, not claims of wrongdoing at\n                               \n\na  particular  time.   The \"type\"  consists  of the  sort of\n                   \n\nwrongdoing for  which employers, typically,  are vicariously\n\nliable  under  principles  of  respondeat   superior.    The\n                                                    \n\nstatutory  scheme does not  concern claimed  wrongdoing that\n\nfalls  outside  respondeat  superior's  traditional  bounds,\n                                    \n\nregardless of when the wrongdoing allegedly occurred.\n                  \n\n          The statutory  scheme  involves both  the  Federal\n                                              \n\n                            -10-\n\nTort  Claims  Act's waiver  of  sovereign  immunity and  the\n\nWestfall Act's  creation of  employee immunity.   The waiver\n\nenables tort plaintiffs to bring against a special employer,\n\nnamely  the federal  government, the  same kind  of ordinary\n                               \n\ntort  action  that plaintiffs  often  bring  against private\n                                                            \n\nemployers,  namely  an  action  claiming  that  an  employee\n\nwrongfully  hurt  the plaintiff  and  that  the employer  is\n\nliable under  the doctrine of respondeat  superior.  Section\n                                                  \n\n1346(b) of the Federal  Tort Claims Act, which is  a general\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, seeks to permit just this type\n\nof action.  It says:\n\n          [T]he  [federal] district  courts .  . .\n          shall  have  exclusive  jurisdiction  of\n          civil  actions  on  claims  against  the\n          United States, for money  damages, . . .\n          for injury . . . caused by the negligent\n          or  wrongful  act  or  omission  of  any\n          employee . .  . while acting  within the\n                                                  \n          scope of his office or employment, under\n                                                  \n          circumstances  where the  United States,\n                                                  \n          if a private person, would be  liable to\n                                                  \n          the claimant in accordance with  the law\n                      \n          of the  place where the  act or omission\n          occurred.\n\n28 U.S.C.    1346(b) (emphasis  added).  But  see 28  U.S.C.\n                                                 \n\n  2680 (limiting the waiver in various ways).\n\n          The  Westfall Act  goes  on to  create  a type  of\n\nrespondeat  superior immunity  for  federal  employees  that\n                    \n\nroughly tracks the federal government's  respondeat superior\n                                                            \n\n                            -11-\n\nliability.  The Westfall Act sets forth a Basic Statement of\n\nemployee  immunity  which  (edited to  emphasize  our point)\n\nsays,\n\n          [1] The remedy against the United States\n          provided by section [] 1346(b) . . . \n                                        \n\n          [2]  for  injury  .   .  .  arising   or\n          resulting from the negligent or wrongful\n          act or  omission of  any employee .  . .\n          while  acting  within the  scope  of his\n                                                  \n          office or employment\n                              \n\n          [3]  is exclusive  of  any  other  civil\n          action . . . for money damages by reason\n          of  the same subject  matter against the\n                                      \n          employee whose act or omission gave rise\n          to the claim . . . .\n\n28 U.S.C.    2679(b)(1) (emphasis  added).  Part  1 of  this\n\nstatement  cross-references  Section  1346(b)'s   waiver  of\n\nsovereign immunity.   Part 2 uses  language almost identical\n\nto that in Section  1346(b).  And, Part 3's  operative words\n\ngranting immunity from actions  seeking damages by reason of\n\nthe \"same subject matter\" would  therefore seem to refer, in\n\na  general way,  to  the respondeat  superior  circumstances\n                                             \n\nfound in the kind of suit that Section 1346(b) describes. \n\n          The  Westfall Act  subsection now  before  us uses\n\nsimilar language.   It  provides for substitution  where the\n\nAttorney General certifies that\n\n          the defendant employee was acting within\n          the scope of his office or employment at\n          the  time of the  incident out  of which\n\n                            -12-\n\n          the claim arose . . . \n                   \n\n28  U.S.C.    2679(d)(1)  (emphasis  added).   The  language\n\n\"acting within the scope of his office or employment\" tracks\n\nthe language  of Section  1346(b).   The  reference to  \"the\n\nclaim,\" appearing right after  the Basic Statement, seems to\n\nrefer to the Basic  Statement's kind of claim.   And, as  we\n\nhave  said, the Basic Statement,  in turn, refers to Section\n\n1346(b), which creates liability if there is  1) an \"injury\"\n\n2) \"caused by\" 3)  an employee's \"negligent or wrongful  act\n\nor omission,\" where 4) the employee  acted \"within the scope\n\nof office or employment,\" and 5) \"under circumstances\" where\n\nstate  law  would make  a  private  employer liable  for  an\n\nemployee's \"act or omission.\"\n\n          The  federal  government's  liability   under  the\n\nFederal Tort Claims Act is not perfectly congruent  with the\n\nfederal  employee's immunity  under the  Westfall Act.   The\n\nsovereign   immunity   waiver   contains    exceptions   and\n\nlimitations  that the  Westfall  Act does  not contain  (but\n\noutside of Section  1346(b)).  See,  e.g., United States  v.\n                                                        \n\nSmith, 111  S.

And,  the  federal government  may\n\nescape liability under Section 1346(b), even if the employee\n\nis immune, by asserting  state or federal law defenses.   28\n\nU.S.C.    2674.    Nonetheless, the  language  of the  basic\n\n\"government-liability-creating\"   and   \"employee-liability-\n\nremoving\"  provisions   makes  clear   that  both   sets  of\n\nprovisions involve  the same  basic kind  of case,  namely a\n                                        \n\nrespondeat superior kind of case.  And that fact is critical\n                   \n\nhere.  Since  Congress intended to limit  grants of immunity\n\nto job-related, respondeat  superior, kinds of  cases, there\n                                    \n\nis  no  reason  to apply  the  Westfall  Act  in cases  that\n\nconcededly do  not involve any kind  of potential respondeat\n                                                            \n\nsuperior liability.  Nor,  is there any reason to  interpret\n        \n\nthat  Act as  taking from  the jury  its traditional  job of\n\ndeciding whether an egregious  tort (well outside the \"scope\n\nof employment\"), in fact, occurred.\n\n          There  is, then,  no  reason to  give the  statute\n\nbefore us  other than  its natural  reading, a  reading that\n\n                            -14-\n\nrequires the  Attorney  General  to  assume  (for  immunity-\n                                           \n\nasserting  purposes), not  to deny,  the occurrence  of some\n                                  \n\n\"incident\" underlying  the plaintiff's claim.   The Attorney\n\nGeneral need not  deny the  incident to obtain  the kind  of\n            \n\njob-related immunity the statute seeks  to bestow.  And, the\n\nAttorney  General  should  not   be  able,  by  denying  the\n                         \n\nincident, to obtain  employee immunity for a tort claim that\n\nis not  job-related,  regardless  of  whether  the  Attorney\n\nGeneral believes the claim to be true or false.  \n\n          3.   Purpose.     One  can  imagine  why  Congress\n                      \n\ndecided  to link  employee immunity  to respondeat  superior\n                                                            \n\nprinciples as described.  Federal employee tort immunity has\n\na public,  not a  private,  objective, namely  the need  for\n\npublic employees faithfully to  discharge their duties.  See\n                                                            \n\nGregoire v. Biddle, 177  F.2d 579, 581 (2d Cir.  1949); Barr\n                                                            \n\nv.  Matteo, 360 U.S. 564, 571 (1959); Westfall v. Erwin, 484\n                                                       \n\nU.S. 292, 296  (1988).   It aims at  avoiding \"exposure\"  to\n\n\"personal  liability\" in  order  to  prevent \"a  substantial\n\ndiminution  in  the vigor  of  Federal  law enforcement  and\n\nimplementation.\"    H.R. Rep. No. 700, 100th Cong., 2d Sess.\n\n3, reprinted  in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 5947.   The resulting\n                \n\nimmunity reflects a balancing of judgments, on the one hand,\n\nabout  the  likelihood  that potential  tort  liability will\n\n                            -15-\n\nadversely affect  job performance  and, on the  other, about\n\nthe potential harm such  immunity might cause potential tort\n\nplaintiffs.    That  balance  may differ  as  between  cases\n\ninside, and outside,  the scope of  employment.  After  all,\n\none might believe that employees  often can change their job\n\nperformance to  avoid, even unfounded, suits  based on, say,\n\nnegligent  performance of  that job,  but that  they  lack a\n\ncomparable ability to avoid, in a similar way, false charges\n\nof  an egregious tort (e.g.,  murder or assault).   And, the\n\npossible  effect  of  such  non-duty-related  suits  on  job\n\nperformance  might  seem  too  uncertain,  or  too  weak,  a\n\njustification for  depriving a plaintiff  of her right  to a\n\njury  trial  in cases  involving  non-duty-related egregious\n\ntorts.  Cf.  Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg,  492 U.S. 33,\n                                             \n\n53  (1989) (Congress may substitute statutory non-jury trial\n\naction for common law jury trial action where former \"action\n\ninheres in, or lies against,  the Federal Government in  its\n\nsovereign  capacity.\").   Hence,  the  statute, as  enacted,\n\nsimply   reflects   different  Congressional   judgments  in\n\ndifferent circumstances.\n\n          As the  dissent suggests,  pp. 31, 34,  infra, our\n                                                       \n\ninterpretation means  that sometimes  Driver  A, who  admits\n\nnegligence will receive immunity, while less culpable Driver\n\n                            -16-\n\nB,  who denies the existence  of any accident  at all, would\n\nnot  receive immunity.   But,  this could  be so  only where\n\nDriver  A can  claim that  the underlying  incident is  job-\n\nrelated,  while  Driver  B  cannot  make  this  claim,  even\n\nhypothetically, for  argument's sake.  This  result does not\n\nseem anomalous given  immunity's job-related public purpose.\n\nAnd, it  is that  public purpose, not  relative culpability,\n\nthat controls the shape of the legal doctrine.\n\n                            -17-\n\n                             B\n\n                          History\n                                 \n\n          The Westfall  Act's history offers  direct support\n\nfor  our  reading  of   the  Act.    First,  the   House  of\n\nRepresentatives Report suggests that Congress did not intend\n\nthe Westfall Act to confer immunity for tort  claims outside\n\nthe respondeat superior  context.  It  simply says that  the\n                       \n\nAct  permits  substitution  of  the United  States  for  the\n\ndefendant employee \n\n          whenever the Attorney General determines\n          that the act or omission alleged to have\n          caused   the  claimant's   injuries  was\n          within  the  scope  of   the  employee's\n          office or employment.\n\nH.R. Rep. No.  700, 100th  Cong., 2d Sess.  9, reprinted  in\n                                                            \n\n1988  U.S.C.C.A.N. at  5952.   The Report  thereby seems  to\n\nassume the Section 1346(b) elements of an act that caused an\n\ninjury. \n\n          Second,  the Report  says  that the  Act does  not\n\npermit   substitution   where   the   conduct   alleged   is\n\n\"egregious:\"\n\n          [T]he United States will incur vicarious\n          liability only  for .  . .  torts . .  .\n          committed  within the  \"scope  of .  . .\n          employment.\"  If an employee  is accused\n          of  egregious  misconduct,  rather  than\n                                   \n          mere negligence or  poor judgment,  then\n          the United States may not be substituted\n          as  the  defendant,  and the  individual\n\n                            -18-\n\n          employee remains liable.\n\nId.  at 5, 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5949 (emphasis added).  This\n   \n\nlanguage suggests  that the Act  does not allow  an immunity\n                                         \n\ncertificate simply  to deny, say, an  alleged killing, rape,\n\nassault, or some  other \"egregious  misconduct\" that  occurs\n\nduring working hours.  It suggests that the Act requires the\n\ncertificate to explain, instead, why the alleged  misconduct\n\nwas not so \"egregious\" as to place it outside the employee's\n\n\"scope of employment.\"   The dissent's interpretation of the\n\nAct is inconsistent with this statement in the Report.\n\n          Third,  Congress  intended  the  Westfall  Act  to\n\nrestore  approximately the  federal  employee tort  immunity\n\nthat  existed prior to the Supreme Court case of Westfall v.\n                                                         \n\nErwin, 484 U.S.  292 (1988).

Nothing  in the  Westfall Act's  history suggests\n\nthat Congress wanted to  change the pre-existing practice in\n\nthis respect.\n\n          Fourth,   the   Westfall  Act   changed  \"official\n\nimmunity\"  by overriding  the Supreme Court's  limitation of\n\nthe doctrine to \"discretionary  functions,\" 484 U.S. at 296-\n\n97, and by extending to  all federal employees a  procedural\n\nprotection   (the    certification   procedure)   previously\n\navailable only to government  drivers.  28 U.S.C.    2679(d)\n\n(1982) (amended by the Westfall Act).  The former purpose is\n\nirrelevant  here.   The  latter  offers  added support,  for\n\nDriver's Act  immunity cases, like common  law cases, turned\n\non  whether the  \"incident\" (essentially  an  auto accident)\n\n                            -20-\n\nfell within the  \"scope of employment,\"  not on whether  any\n\nbasic  incident occurred.   See,  e.g., Henderson  v. United\n                                                            \n\nStates, 429 F.2d 588, 590 (10th Cir. 1970) (looking at \"time\n      \n\nof  the accident\").    Moreover, those  cases indicate  that\n\nDriver's Act \"immunity,\" like Westfall Act \"immunity,\" arose\n\nin a respondeat superior context.  See id. \n                                          \n\n          We recognize  that the Driver's  Act tied employee\n\nimmunity to  the  government's Section  1346(b),  respondeat\n                                                            \n\nsuperior liability  more explicitly  than does the  Westfall\n        \n\nAct,  for, in the context  of removal, the  Drivers Act said\n\nthat  if the  federal court  finds  (before trial)  that the\n\nplaintiff would  have no Section 1346(b)  remedy against the\n\nUnited States,  the \"case  shall  be remanded  to the  State\n\ncourt.\"    28  U.S.C.     2679(d)  (1982).    This  language\n\nindicates  that the  Driver's Act  would not  have protected\n                                            \n\ndrivers against claims of  \"egregious torts,\" whether or not\n\nthey allegedly occurred during the driver's work hours.

The Westfall  Act, while copying much Driver's\n\nAct  language, leaves  out this  specific remand  provision.\n\nBut  it apparently does so  for a reason  not here relevant,\n\nnamely  to   make  clear  that  the   United  States,  after\n\nsubstitution, can  assert various defenses that  may, or may\n\nnot, have been available  to the employee.  See  28 U.S.C.  \n                                               \n\n2674;  H.R. Rep.

We therefore do  not see\n\nhow one could find much of significance in this difference.\n\n                             C\n\n                      Direct Precedent\n                                      \n\n          We  have  found one  circuit  court  case and  one\n\ndistrict  court  case directly  on  point.    In  McHugh  v.\n                                                        \n\nUniversity of  Vermont,  966 F.2d  67  (2d Cir.  1992),  the\n                      \n\nplaintiff  claimed  that  a federal  employee  had  sexually\n\nharassed her.   The Attorney  General filed  a Westfall  Act\n\ncertificate.   The Second  Circuit overruled the certificate\n\nbecause the  Act does not  permit the government  to certify\n\nthat  the   alleged  incident   is  \"within  the   scope  of\n\nemployment\" simply \"by denying that the acts occurred.\"  Id.\n                                                            \n\n                            -22-\n\nat 74.  It added (as do we, in Part III) that the Government\n\nneed  not  accept the  plaintiff's  version  of the  alleged\n                                           \n\nincident,  for it can argue that the \"context of the alleged\n\nacts\"  places them  within the \"scope  of employment.\"   Id.\n                                                            \n\nThe  trial  court,  it   explained,  may  hold  a  pre-trial\n\nevidentiary hearing to resolve factual disputes  relevant to\n\n\"context.\"  Id.   Our holding  here essentially follows  the\n               \n\nSecond Circuit.\n\n          In Jackson  v. United States, 751 F. Supp. 911 (D.\n                                      \n\nColo. 1990),  the plaintiff  alleged that the  defendant, an\n\nArmy psychotherapist had engaged  in sexual intercourse with\n\nher during  treatment.   The district  court held  invalid a\n\nWestfall Act certificate that simply denied that the alleged\n\nevent had taken place.  See id. at 913.  \n                               \n\n          Language,  context, history, and precedent lead to\n\nthe same  general  conclusions.   1) The  immunity that  the\n\nWestfall Act  confers upon federal employees  arises in, and\n\nis confined  to, a  certain context, namely  the \"respondeat\n                                                            \n\nsuperior\"  context, described roughly  in Section 1346(b) of\n        \n\nthe Federal  Tort Claims Act.   2) To permit  a Westfall Act\n\ncertificate  simply  to deny  that  anything occurred  would\n\nextend a form of this  immunity well outside the \"respondeat\n                                                            \n\n                            -23-\n\nsuperior\" context to  \"egregious\" torts allegedly  committed\n        \n\nat  work.   It would  permit, to  a significant  degree, the\n\nAttorney General  and district judge (rather  than the jury)\n\nto decide whether allegations of such non-work-related torts\n\nwere  true  or false.   3)  We  therefore conclude  that the\n\ncertificate cannot assert \"immunity\" simply by  denying that\n\nanything occurred.   We read  the statute to  mean what  its\n\nwords  naturally  say, namely  that  the Attorney  General's\n\ncertificate must assume the existence of an \"incident out of\n\nwhich the claim arose.\"  \n\n                            III\n\n        What \"Incident\" Must the Certificate Assume?\n                                                   \n\n          We  are aware  of one  important question  that we\n\nhave not yet  asked or answered.   Given our interpretation,\n\ncould a plaintiff, through artful pleading, transform a job-\n\nrelated tort into a non-job-related tort simply by alleging,\n\nsay an \"off-duty\" state of mind (such as \"malicious\" intent)\n\nor  by alleging  that  a negligent  action  was carried  out\n\nintentionally?    If so,  will  federal  employees lose,  in\n\npractice, the  job-related  immunity that  Congress  clearly\n\nintended the Westfall Act to provide?\n\n          Consider,  for example,  an  accident  victim  who\n\nmight  normally file  a suit  charging negligence.   Suppose\n\n                            -24-\n\nthat such a victim also claimed  that the defendant employee\n\nacted  with   a  state  of  mind   that,  under  traditional\n\nrespondeat superior doctrine, would place the action outside\n                   \n\nthe  \"scope   of  employment,\"  say,  an   \"intentional\"  or\n\n\"deliberate\" state of  mind.  See Miller  v. Federated Dep't\n                                                            \n\nStores, 364  Mass. at 348,  304 N.E.2d  at 579  (intentional\n      \n\ntort  is  normally  outside  \"scope  of  employment\"  unless\n\ncommitted   to   prevent   victim   interference   with  job\n\nperformance).  Or, suppose  that the victim alleged detailed\n\nfacts  indicating that, at the  time, the employee  was on a\n\n\"frolic of his own.\"   Weiner v. Mairs, 234 Mass.  156, 158,\n                                      \n\n125 N.E. 149, 150 (1919).   To force the Attorney General to\n\naccept  all such facts as valid might often prevent her from\n\nremoving the  case from  state court, from  substituting the\n\nUnited States  as defendant,  and from freeing  the employee\n\nfrom the burden of the lawsuit.  \n\n          This   problem,  however,  does   not  require  an\n\ninterpretation  that would  permit the  Attorney General  to\n\ndeny the basic \"incident.\"   Rather, we can (and  do) insist\n\nthat  the  certificate  assume  some  kind  of  harm-causing\n                                                            \n\nincident, while leaving the Attorney General free to dispute\n        \n\ncharacterizations of the  incident and subsidiary  immunity-\n\nrelated facts.   The Second Circuit held  precisely the same\n\n                            -25-\n\nin McHugh.   966 F.2d at  74.  Moreover, we  previously held\n         \n\nthat  the  Attorney  General's  certificate  may  contest  a\n\nplaintiff's incident-describing  and incident-characterizing\n\nfacts  and that  the  court  may  resolve any  such  factual\n\nconflicts, relevant to immunity, prior  to trial.  In Nasuti\n                                                            \n\nv. Scannell,  906 F.2d 802  (1st Cir. 1990),  the plaintiff,\n           \n\ninjured  while  riding in  the  back of  a  government truck\n\ndriven by federal employee Scannell, sued Scannell, claiming\n\nthat Scannell had intentionally injured him by driving fast,\n                               \n\nthereby jostling him,  and throwing him  from side to  side,\n\n\"in spite  of\" Nasuti's  \"entreaties\" to stop.   We  assumed\n\nthat these  factual allegations, if true,  would have placed\n\nScannell's  actions outside the  \"scope of  his employment.\"\n\nSee Miller, 364 Mass. at 348, 304 N.E.2d at 579 (intentional\n          \n\ntorts normally outside \"scope of employment\").  But, we held\n\nthe   immunity  certificate   valid,  pending   a  pre-trial\n\nevidentiary  hearing that  would resolve  the key  immunity-\n\nrelated factual dispute, namely whether Scannell intended to\n                                                         \n\nharm  Nasuti.   See  id. at  808.   The  Attorney  General's\n                        \n\ncertificate  in Nasuti did not deny the existence of a harm-\n                      \n\ncausing  incident.    It  denied  related  descriptions  and\n\ncharacterizations of that incident.  By way of contrast  the\n\ncertificate  before us  denies  the existence  of any  harm-\n\n                            -26-\n\ncausing incident at all.\n\n          We recognize an obvious problem with the line that\n\nwe, like the  Second Circuit, have tried to draw.  How clear\n\nis the line?   Will  we later  have to  answer questions  in\n\nparticular  factual  circumstances   about  the   difference\n\nbetween denying facts that amount to a \"characterization\" or\n\n\"description\"  and  denying that  any  harm-causing incident\n\noccurred at all?   Compare Unwin v. Campbell, 863  F.2d 124,\n                                            \n\n133 (1st Cir. 1988)  (extent of defendant's participation in\n\nincident is part of qualified immunity inquiry) with Domegan\n                                                            \n\nv.

Campbell, 863  F.2d  at 132.   We\n                                   \n\nconcede this kind of administrative problem would likely not\n\narise  were we to read  the statute either  1) as permitting\n\nthe certificate to deny the  \"incident\" in its entirety,  or\n\n2) as insisting that  the certificate accept the plaintiff's\n\nalleged  account  as totally  valid.    But, we  nonetheless\n\nbelieve  the  problem is  the  least  potential  evil.   The\n\nadministrative problem is not insuperable.  Cases that raise\n\nthis kind of  issue seem  rare.  Moreover,  we have  already\n\npointed  out  the more  serious  harm  that would  accompany\n\n                            -27-\n\neither  of the  other choices,  namely unduly  expanding, or\n\nconstricting,  the practical  scope  of  the  immunity  that\n\nCongress  intended to confer.   And, we cannot  find in this\n\nadministrative  consideration  justification for  imposing a\n\nmajor restraint upon the plaintiff's  right to a jury trial.\n\nConsequently,  we believe that  our \"middle  ground\" adheres\n\nmore faithfully to the statute itself.\n\n                            -28-\n\n                             IV\n\n                       Other Matters\n                                    \n\n          We add two final,  unrelated points.  First, after\n\noral  argument  in  this  case the  Fourth  Circuit  decided\n\nJohnson v. Carter, No. 90-3077 (4th Cir., Jan. 15, 1993), in\n                 \n\nwhich  it held  that  courts cannot  review the  validity of\n\nWestfall  Act certificates.  Id.  at 7.   We previously have\n                                \n\nheld to the contrary.   Kelly v. United States,  924 F.2d at\n                                              \n\n357; Nasuti, 906  F.2d at 812.  The Government  has asked us\n           \n\nnot   to  assess   our  previous   holding  in   respect  to\n\nreviewability.  And, we shall not do so.\n\n          Second,  the  Government  originally   appealed  a\n\ntotally separate issue, whether or not federal law preempted\n\ncertain  of Wood's state law  claims.  The  panel refused to\n\nconsider that aspect  of the  appeal on the  ground that  an\n\ninterlocutory appeal  did not lie from  the district court's\n\ndecision of that question.  See Zayas-Green  v. Casaine, 906\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 18, 22 (1st Cir.  1990).  We have accepted the  panel's\n\ndecision  on that matter in this en banc proceeding.  Hence,\n\nwe have not decided the preemption issue on the merits.  The\n\nGovernment  remains free to raise the issue on appeal from a\n\nfinal judgment.\n\n                            -29-\n\n          Applying our basic determination of the law to the\n\ncase  before   us,  we   find  that  the   Government  here,\n\nimpermissibly,  has rested  its  certificate  simply upon  a\n\ndenial that any \"incident\" took place.  We do not see how it\n\ncould  characterize the  incidents at  issue in  a way  that\n\nwould  bring them within defendant's \"line  of duty,\" and it\n\nhas  not tried to  do so.  We  consequently believe that the\n\ndistrict court's decision denying substitution and dismissal\n\nwas correct, and that decision is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                            -30-\n\n    COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge, SELYA  and BOUDIN, Circuit\n                                                            \n\nJudges,  dissenting.1    In  this  case  a  federal  employee\n     \n\ncharged  with  an  intentional  tort said  that  the  alleged\n\nincidents never  occurred, and the Attorney  General issued a\n\n\"scope of employment\" certificate  under the Westfall Act, 28\n\nU.S.C.    2679, accepting  the employee's version  of events.\n\nIn  our  view, the  Attorney  General's  scope of  employment\n\ncertificate must be respected unless  and until set aside  by\n\nthe district court; and the certificate can be set aside only\n\nif the  judge determines--in this case,  after an evidentiary\n            \n\nhearing  to decide  whether the incidents  occurred--that the\n\nemployee engaged in improper conduct outside the scope of his\n\nemployment.\n\n                             I.\n\n    In the Westfall Act,  Congress told the Attorney General\n\nto  determine whether  to  certify that  a federal  employee,\n\nagainst  whom a civil suit has been filed, was acting \"within\n\nthe scope  of his  office or employment  at the  time of  the\n\nincident out  of which the claim arose . .  . .\"  28 U.S.C.  \n\n2679(d)(1), (2).  Where  this certificate issues, the statute\n\ndirects that the  case, if initially brought  in state court,\n\nshall be removed to federal court  and in any event that \"the\n\nUnited States  shall be substituted as  the party defendant.\"\n\n                   \n\n    1This opinion represents the work, as well as the views,\nof all three judges so we have signed it jointly.\n\n                            -28-\n                             28\n\nId.   The  statute makes the certificate \"conclusive\"  so far\n \n\nas it  is used to remove  a case to federal  court.     Id.  \n                                                         \n\n2679(d)(2).  The statute does not address, and thereby leaves\n\nopen, the possibility that  where the Attorney General grants\n\na  certificate, it may be  reviewed so far  as it substitutes\n\nthe United States for the employee. \n\n    On   February   8,   1990,   the   U.S.   Attorney   for\n\nMassachusetts,  who  is  delegated  authority to  issue  such\n\ncertificates,  28  C.F.R.     15.3,  issued  a  Westfall  Act\n\ncertificate in this  case affirming that  Owens at all  times\n\nreferenced in the complaint was \"acting with the scope of his\n\noffice . . . .\"   The  United States then  substituted itself\n\nfor Owens.  Needless to say, the government has never claimed\n\nthat the incidents,  if they occurred as  Wood alleged, would\n\nbe behavior within the  scope of Owens' duties.   Rather, the\n\ncertificate amounts  to an  assertion that  Owens was at  all\n\ntimes acting within the scope  of his employment because,  in\n                                                       \n\nthe Attorney General's view,  the incidents did not occur  as\n\nalleged by Wood.\n\n    Accordingly,  we  now  face  a situation  in  which  the\n\nAttorney General's delegate has  issued a certificate and the\n\nplaintiff  has sought to set  it aside.   One option--that of\n\nsimply  assuming   the  certificate  to  be   true  (and  the\n\ncomplaint's allegations  false)--we reject.   This court  has\n\nheld that the grant  of a scope certificate is  reviewable as\n\n                            -29-\n                             29\n\nto substitution because any other reading could foreclose the\n\nplaintiff's  claim without a  judicial determination.  Nasuti\n                                                            \n\nv.  Scannell, 906 F.2d 802 (1st Cir. 1990).2  The government,\n           \n\nafter initially resisting such district court review, has now\n\naccepted its necessity.\n\n    We are  equally confident that the  opposite alternative\n\nmust be rejected: the district court cannot proceed merely by\n\nassuming  the  complaint's allegations  to  be  true and  the\n\ncertificate  false.    Such  an  assumption  would  give  the\n\nplaintiff complete control over the certification process and\n\npermit the  certificate to be nullified  without any judicial\n\nfinding.    The  statute  permits a  certificate  where  \"the\n\ndefendant employee was acting within the scope of his  office\n\nor employment at  the time of the  incident . . . .\"   In our\n\nview, this language speaks not to what plaintiff or defendant\n\nmay  allege  but  rather  to  the  actual  events  and  their\n          \n\nconnection to the employee's office or employment.\n\n    Finally,  to  us it  is of  no  moment that  the statute\n\nrefers to \"the incident out of which the claim arose.\"  It is\n\nan  accident of  language--a  reflection of  the most  common\n\ncase--that the  statute posits a  \"happening.\"  In  this case\n\nthe  Attorney  General   concluded,  as   evidenced  by   the\n\ncertificate,  that the  events claimed  by plaintiff  did not\n\n                   \n\n    2That  is  so,  for  example,  where  the  Westfall  Act\nmandates substitution  but  the tort  is  one for  which  the\nUnited States has not waived its sovereign immunity.\n\n                            -30-\n                             30\n\noccur, at least in the form alleged  by Wood.  But it is  not\n\ndifficult  to find here  a set of  \"incidents\" or occurrences\n\nconceded  by   everyone:    Owens  did   have  a  supervisory\n\nrelationship with Wood,  met and talked  with her on  various\n\noccasions  and danced with her at an official function.  What\n\nis  disputed is  precisely what  was said  and done  on these\n\noccasions,  much  as  a   government  driver  and  a  private\n\nplaintiff  might  give two  quite  different  versions of  an\n\naccident.\n\n    Indeed, we think  the Westfall Act  would apply even  if\n\nthere were less of an \"incident\" than is indisputably present\n              \n\nin this case.   For example, surely the statute  applies with\n\nthe same force whether  a postal service driver says  that he\n\ndid not hit the plaintiff's car or that he did so but was not\n\nat fault.   \"Incident,\" in  other words,  must encompass  the\n\npossibility  that something  did not  happen as  well  as the\n\npossibility that it did.\n\n    Against  this background, we confront a single question:\n\nshould the judge or  the jury make the  initial determination\n\nas to  what  did or  did not  occur and  its relationship  to\n\nOwens'  office or  employment?   The  case  is peculiar  only\n\nbecause  the  same issue  happens to  be  common both  to the\n\nvalidity  of  the  certificate  and  to  the  merits  of  the\n\ncontroversy  between  plaintiff  and  defendant.    If  Owens\n\nmolested  Wood, the certificate is  invalid and he is liable;\n                                              \n\n                            -31-\n                             31\n\nif it never happened  and he maintained a  proper supervisor-\n\nemployee relationship,  then  his behavior  toward  Wood  was\n\nwithin the scope of his employment and he has no liability.\n                                     \n\n                            II.\n\n    Although the question  of who should decide  is not free\n\nfrom doubt, we believe that the Attorney General's\n\ncertificate cannot be set aside unless and until the district\n\njudge concludes that Wood's version of events  is correct and\n\ntherefore that  Owens could not  have been acting  within the\n\nscope of his employment.  This course appears to us to be the\n\none most consistent  with statutory language,  with Congress'\n\npolicy,  with Supreme  Court  and other  precedent, and  with\n\nsound administration of the statute.  Each of these points is\n\naddressed in turn.\n\n    We  start  with   the  statute's  language,  as   proper\n\ninterpretation   requires.    See   Landreth  Timber  Co.  v.\n                                                       \n\nLandreth,  471  U.S.  681,  685  (1985).   The  Westfall  Act\n       \n\noperates automatically, upon the  filing of a certificate, to\n\nremove the case and  to substitute the United States  for the\n\nemployee.   The  statute provides  that \"upon  certification,\n\n[the]  action . . . shall proceed\" against the United States,\n\n28  U.S.C.   2679(d)(4).  The certificate, in other words, is\n\nan official act  with legal consequences unless  and until it\n\nis  set   aside.    The   official  act  is   reviewable,  by\n\nimplication,   but  it  is  operative  until  found  invalid,\n\n                            -32-\n                             32\n\nprotected by the same presumption of validity that ordinarily\n\nattaches  to  official  action.   See  Citizens  to  Preserve\n                                                            \n\nOverton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415 (1971); United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v.  Chemical  Foundation,  Inc., 272  U.S.  1,  14-15\n                                     \n\n(1926).  \n\n    The certificate  filed by  the Attorney General  in this\n\ncase  is not facially  invalid.  As  we have noted,  there is\n\nnothing in the statute that requires the  Attorney General or\n\nthe court to accept the plaintiff's version of events as true\n\nwithout   scrutiny  (and   such   a  requirement   would   be\n\nsufficiently  odd that a  court could not  lightly infer it).\n\nNor  is  there  anything  that prevents  a  certificate  from\n\nissuing where the \"incident\" charged in the complaint did not\n\noccur  and  the defendant  engaged  only  in proper  behavior\n\noccurring  wholly   within  the   scope  of  his   office  or\n\nemployment.  In sum, so far as the statute is concerned, this\n                                         \n\nis a proper certificate, unless  and until a factual  finding\n\nin Wood's favor undermines the premise of the certificate.\n\n    It  is even  clearer  that  the  congressional  policies\n\nunderlying the statute support the government's position.  At\n\npresent,  Owens is  not presumed  to be a  molester; he  is a\n\nmilitary  officer who  has  been accused  of making  improper\n\nadvances to an employee  whom he supervised in the  course of\n\nhis official duties.  To issue his certificate,  the Attorney\n\nGeneral must have  concluded that in  this case the  advances\n\n                            -33-\n                             33\n\nwere not  made.    Where the  Attorney General  has issued  a\n\nscope  certificate, Congress intended  to spare employees not\n\nonly from liability for  misconduct related to their official\n\nduties but also from the burden and expense of defending such\n              \n\nsuits.3 \n\n    In  other  words,  the  Westfall  Act  is  not a  simple\n\nimmunity statute saying that  certain misconduct is protected\n\nagainst  liability and  leaving the  employee to  assert that\n\nimmunity in litigation.  Rather, by its precise terms and its\n\nunderlying  policy, the statute meant to lift the case into a\n\nfederal  forum and  relieve the  employee  from the  cost and\n\neffort of defending  the case if the  Attorney General issues\n                               \n\nthe certificate.4  A certificate having issued in this  case,\n\nsurely  Owens should  not  be deprived  of  the advantage  of\n\nhaving the  government defend the  case, a protection  that a\n\nnegligent postal employee would gain as a matter of course.\n\n    Turning  to precedent,  the  Supreme Court  has not  yet\n\n                   \n\n    3The  Supreme  Court  has  been  equally  concerned,  in\nfashioning  immunity  doctrine, with  \"the  general costs  of\nsubjecting officials to  the risks  of trial--distraction  of\nofficials  from  their  governmental  duties,  inhibition  of\ndiscretionary action,  and  deterrence of  able  people  from\npublic service.\"   Harlow  v.

If the  certificate in  this case is\n\ninvalidated without  a factual  finding, Owens will  face the\n\nburden  of going to trial even though the evidentiary hearing\n\nmight show  that at all  times he conducted  himself properly\n\nand within the scope of his office.\n\n    As for circuit court  precedent relating to the Westfall\n\nAct  itself, our  own Nasuti  decision directly  supports the\n                           \n\nview that  \"where the facts underlying  the scope certificate\n\nare  disputed,  .  .  . the  matter  [must]  be independently\n\nresolved by the court . . . .\"  906 F.2d at 813.

Other\n\ncircuits,  in accord with  Nasuti, have held  or assumed that\n                                \n\nthe district judge may resolve facts that arise in the course\n\nof  a challenge  to  a certificate.    See, e.g.,  Schrob  v.\n                                                        \n\nCatterson,  967  F.2d  929,  936 (3d  Cir.  1992);  Brown  v.\n                                                        \n\nArmstrong, 949 F.2d 1007, 1012 (8th Cir. 1991).   \n        \n\n    The  only circuit \"precedent\" to  the contrary is a very\n\nbrief statement in McHugh v. University of  Vermont, 966 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n67 (2d Cir. 1992).  With respect, this statement is buried at\n\nthe end of a  long opinion addressed to different  issues and\n\nmay  well  be  qualified  by the  sentence  that  immediately\n\nfollows.  Id. at 74.   It is by no means clear that the court\n           \n\nthought it was deciding the issue presented in this case, and\n\nit certainly gave  no reasons for deciding it one  way or the\n\nother, which  strongly reinforces  the inference that  it did\n\nnot intend to decide the issue at all.\n\n    Finally, while this is the least weighty  of reasons, we\n\nthink that the  reading urged  by the government  is the  one\n\nmost consistent with sound administration of the statute.  It\n\nseems quite  likely that  the evidentiary hearing  before the\n\ndistrict  judge  would  be  an efficient  course:  if  Owens'\n\nversion  of  events were  accepted  after  the hearing,  that\n\nfinding would  sustain  the certificate  and  (by  collateral\n\nestoppel) dispose of Wood's  claim on the merits at  the same\n\ntime.  If instead Wood's version were accepted, then we think\n\n                            -36-\n                             36\n\nOwens would similarly  be bound  by the result;  he would  be\n\nresubstituted  as a  defendant,  and the  case would  proceed\n\nbefore  a jury  on other  unadjudicated issues,  such as  the\n\nissue of damages.6\n\n    By contrast,  under  the majority's  approach,  district\n\ncourts--and ultimately this court--will continue to engage in\n\ndifficult, time-wasting controversies  (like this one)  about\n\nprecisely which  facts pertaining to the  scope of employment\n                     \n\nissue are for the district judge and which  are for the jury.\n\nHair   splitting  distinctions  and  anomalous  results  will\n\nmultiply.7    If  Congress  commanded this  course,  then  it\n\nshould be  obeyed.  But  there is no reason  to inflict these\n\nhardships  upon  ourselves  and  the  judicial  process  when\n\nCongress' statute  and its policy  both look in  the opposite\n\ndirection.\n\n                            III.\n\n                   \n\n    6If  the  employee is  content  to  have the  government\nsubstitute itself  for him  to  defend his  conduct, then  we\nthink   that  his   interests   and   the  government's   are\nsufficiently  aligned  for  collateral  estoppel  to  operate\nagainst him.  See Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 154\n                                         \n(1979) (one who assists  in the prosecution or defense  of an\naction  in aid  of  some  interest  of  his  own  is  bound);\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments   39.\n\n    7For example, suppose Wood said she had been offensively\ntouched but Owens said he touched her only accidentally as he\nwas handing her a  stack of correspondence.  If  the Attorney\nGeneral  then  granted  a  certificate,  there  would  be  an\n\"incident\" and a clear scope of employment issue.  Presumably\nthe certificate  could not be  set aside  without a  district\ncourt factual  finding.    Why  this  case  should  follow  a\ndifferent procedural course is hard to understand.\n\n                            -37-\n                             37\n\n         The  arguments  against the  resolution  we propose\n\nshould be  faced  head on.    The main  adverse  consequence,\n\nperhaps the  only practical argument against  our reading, is\n\nthat it  deprives the plaintiff of trial  by jury on an issue\n\nthat  goes to  the heart  of the  merits, as  well as  to the\n\nvalidity  of the  certificate.   That  common issue,  turning\n\ndirectly  on credibility in this case, may be well suited for\n\njury resolution.  This is not a small objection; the right to\n\njury  trial  as at  common law  is  preserved by  the Seventh\n\nAmendment  itself.   While the  Seventh Amendment  ex proprio\n                                                            \n\nvigore  does not apply in this case, courts are protective of\n     \n\njury trial,  e.g., Pernell v.  Southall Realty, 416  U.S. 363\n                                             \n\n(1974), and do not  lightly read an ambiguous statute  to cut\n\noff the opportunity of a litigant to obtain a jury.8\n\n    Yet under the Westfall Act the inevitable and deliberate\n\neffect of what  Congress has done is to supplant the jury for\n                                   \n\nall  cases within the  ken of  that statute,  including cases\n\nwhere the scope question goes to the heart of the merits.  In\n\nthe  ordinary tort  claim  arising when  a government  driver\n\nnegligently runs  into another  car, jury trial  is precisely\n\nwhat  is  lost   to  a  plaintiff  when   the  government  is\n\nsubstituted  for the  employee.   Because claims  against the\n\n                   \n\n    8The Seventh  Amendment does not apply  because there is\nno constitutional right to a trial by jury against the United\nStates.   See Lehman v.  Nakshian, 453 U.S.  156, 160 (1981).\n                                \nThrough the  statute and  the certificate, Congress  has made\nthis suit at present one against the United States.\n\n                            -38-\n                             38\n\nUnited  States  are not  normally subject  to jury  trial, 28\n\nU.S.C.    2402, neither  the plaintiff's claim  of negligence\n\nnor the question  of damages is submitted to a  jury.  A case\n\nof \"deliberate\" harm, such  as might arise if a  prison guard\n\nor an FBI agent  were sued for assault, could  equally result\n\nin a bench trial on the merits.  See 28 U.S.C.   2680(h).\n                                   \n\n    Policy concerns would be quite different if the Attorney\n\nGeneral's certificate were  allowed to preclude any  judicial\n\nadjudication of  Wood's claim.   However, the  government has\n\nabandoned its earlier position  (which we rejected in Nasuti)\n                                                           \n\nthat its certificate  is conclusive and now disowns  a recent\n\ncircuit  decision  that reaches  such  a  result, Johnson  v.\n                                                        \n\nCarter, 983  F.2d 1316 (4th Cir. 1993).  Under our reading of\n     \n\nthe statute, the plaintiff simply gets an adjudication on one\n\nissue by the  trial judge  instead of a  jury, with  adequate\n\ndiscovery  and full opportunity  to present and cross-examine\n\nwitnesses, which is the  way that plaintiffs normally proceed\n\nagainst  the government.    And given  that substitution  has\n\noccurred, this is  a case against  the government unless  and\n                \n\nuntil the certificate is set aside.  \n\n    With  respect,  the  more  technical  arguments  of  the\n\nmajority seem to  us unpersuasive.   In framing the  Westfall\n\nAct, Congress no doubt had in mind the classic  case in which\n\n\"the  wrongdoing\" (if it occurred) was the type for which the\n\ngovernment  would  be responsible  under  respondeat superior\n                                                            \n\n                            -39-\n                             39\n\ndoctrine.    But  a claim  of  perfect  symmetry between  the\n\ncertifiable  conduct (under the  Westfall Act) and government\n\nliability (under the Federal Tort Claims Act) is refuted, and\n\ndefinitively so, by United  States v. Smith, 111 S.  Ct. 1180\n                                          \n\n(1991).   Smith  held  that the  Westfall  Act immunizes  the\n              \n\nemployee  for conduct within the scope  of employment even if\n                                                            \n\nthere is no  remedy against the United States.   Id. at 1185.\n                                                  \n\nAccord, H. Rep. No. 700, supra, p. 6.\n                             \n\n    Similarly, it seems to us beside the point that Congress\n\nplainly did not intend to grant immunity to employees who act\n\negregiously.   Owens  has not  been  found to  have  molested\n                                         \n\nanyone;  he is  charged  with misconduct,  just  as a  postal\n                      \n\nemployee might  be accused  of  negligent driving  or an  FBI\n\nagent of assault during the arrest of a suspect.  If Owens is\n\nfound by the district judge to have engaged in harassment, he\n\nwill  not have immunity and will be personally liable.  Until\n\nthat  happens, the  certificate  affords him  the  procedural\n\nadvantages of government substitution and representation.\n\n    The majority also  relies upon the  House Report on  the\n\nWestfall  Act, which states that \"[i]f an employee is accused\n\nof  egregious  misconduct,  rather than  negligence  or  poor\n\njudgment, then the  United States may  not be substituted  as\n\nthe  defendant, and the  individual employee remains liable.\"\n\nH. Rep. No. 700, supra, p. 5.  There is no hint that Congress\n                     \n\nmeant to  place any weight on  the word \"accused.\"   From the\n\n                            -40-\n                             40\n\nprior  and succeeding  sentences, it  appears that  the House\n\nReport  was simply  assuring readers  that the  United States\n\nwould  not take  on the  burden of  paying for  the egregious\n\ntorts  of employees  plainly committed  outside the  scope of\n\nemployment.   See id.   That result will  be achieved whether\n                    \n\nthe judge  or jury makes  the initial  determination of  what\n\nhappened.\n\n    Finally,  the  majority's broadest  but  we  think least\n\npersuasive argument is its  intimation that Congress would be\n\ndismayed  to  discover that  its  statute  applied to  Owens.\n\nCertainly Congress  would be shocked if  harassment were held\n\nto  be covered by official immunity, but no one is suggesting\n\nthat it is.  Congress  could not be shocked to  discover that\n\nits statute  might apply where intentional  harm was charged,\n\nsince intentional  harm clearly is  covered in some  cases.9 \n\nThe  reality  is that  Congress in  this  case, as  with many\n\nstatutes, probably did not  think one way or the  other about\n\nunusual applications, and it is an illusion to think that one\n\nknows just what Congress  would have thought if it  had faced\n\nthe precise issue in this case.\n\n    In such cases, the court's job is not to speculate about\n\n                   \n\n    9Notably, the Federal Tort  Claims Act itself waives the\ngovernment's  sovereign  immunity  for  claims   of  assault,\nbattery  and false imprisonment  by law enforcement officers.\n28  U.S.C.     2679(h).    It  must  be  undisputed  that  an\nindividual FBI agent,  if sued for assault during  an arrest,\ncould obtain a valid Westfall Act certificate.\n\n                            -41-\n                             41\n\nlegislative intent that never  existed.  Rather, our  task is\n\nto  piece out the statutory edifice as best we can, \"giv[ing]\n\ncoherence to what Congress has done within the bounds imposed\n\nby a fair reading  of [the] legislation.\"  Achilli  v. United\n                                                            \n\nStates,  353  U.S.  373, 379  (1957).    And  if Congress  is\n     \n\ndispleased when it sees how its general language  and purpose\n\nhave been fitted  to the case, it is  always open to Congress\n\nto refine its statute.\n\n  Having stated our view as to what the statute requires, we\n\nwant to make clear that the charge made by Wood against Owens\n\nis a very serious one involving--if the allegations are true-\n\n-multiple abuses of Owens'  position as a government official\n\nas  well as  continuing sexual harassment.   Nothing  in this\n\nopinion  should  suggest that  Wood's  version  of events  is\n\nunsubstantial  or implausible.  We  simply do not  know:  The\n\nAttorney General's certificate  may be well founded or it may\n\nrest on a faulty  factual premise.  Our concern is  simply to\n\nhave the validity of  the certificate and the correctness  of\n\nits  premise  determined  swiftly   and  at  the  outset,  in\n\naccordance with Congress' statutory plan.\n\n  For the reasons stated,  we would vacate the order  of the\n\ndistrict court and remand the case for an evidentiary hearing\n\nto  determine whether Owens, in  his conduct vis  a vis Wood,\n\nacted solely within the scope of his office or employment.\n\n                            -42-\n                             42\n",

The Westfall Act provides a\n                             \n\nfederal employee with immunity from an ordinary tort suit if\n                                                            \n\nthe  suit arises out of acts performed \"within the scope of\"\n\nthe  defendant  employee's  \"office  or  employment.\"    The\n\nimmunity attaches  when the Attorney General  files with the\n\ncourt a certificate stating that\n\n          the defendant employee was acting within\n                                           \n          the scope of his office or employment at\n                                                  \n          the  time of  the incident out  of which\n                                                  \n          the claim arose.\n                          \n\n28 U.S.C.    2679(d)(1) (emphasis added).   Upon filing this\n\ncertificate,  the Attorney  General can  remove the  case to\n\nfederal court (if it started in state court), substitute the\n\nUnited States as defendant,  and, effectively, immunize  the\n\nemployee from any personal liability.  28 U.S.C.   2679(d).\n\n          This   appeal  focuses  on  whether  the  Attorney\n\nGeneral  may issue  a Westfall  Act certificate  that simply\n\ndenies that  any injury-causing action occurred.   Suppose a\n\nplaintiff  claims that  a  federal employee  committed  acts\n\nclearly outside the scope of  employment, as here, where the\n\nplaintiff  has   alleged  sexual  harassment   amounting  to\n\n\"assault  and battery.\"   Can  the Attorney  General certify\n\nthat  there  simply was  no such  event?   To  rephrase this\n\nquestion using the statutory terms underlined above: Can the\n\ncertificate grant immunity simply by denying  the occurrence\n\n                            -4-\n\nof any \"incident out of which  the claim arose?\"  Would such\n\na certificate fall within the scope of the immunity statute?\n\n          The  legal question  is  important,  for, where  a\n\nplaintiff alleges a serious intentional tort, say assault or\n\nrape, and also presents enough evidence to survive a summary\n\njudgment  motion, the  answer  will affect  the  plaintiff's\n\nright  to a  jury  trial.   A  \"yes\" answer  means  that the\n\nAttorney  General  and  the   trial  judge  (reviewing   the\n\ncertificate) will decide whether  or not the alleged assault\n\noccurred.  A  \"no\" answer reserves the basic  factual issues\n\nfor a  jury, in effect, maintaining  the plaintiff's Seventh\n\nAmendment right to a trial by jury in \"Suits at common law.\"\n\nU.S. Const. amend. VII. \n\n          In our view, the answer is \"no.\"  This \"no\" answer\n\nfinds support in the  statutory language, read together with\n\nrelated  provisions; the  legislative history;  the relevant\n\ncase  law  background;  and   direct  precedent  from  other\n\ncircuits.  We find nothing to suggest that Congress intended\n\na  contrary result.  We therefore conclude that the Westfall\n\nAct certificate  cannot deny the  basic \"incident\"  charged,\n\nthough  (as we  shall explain in  Part III)  the certificate\n\nneed  not accept  the  plaintiff's version  of  just how  it\n                                                        \n\n                            -5-\n\noccurred.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          Theresa  Wood, the plaintiff,  worked as secretary\n\nto the  federal employee  defendant, Charles Owens,  an Army\n\nMajor.   She  filed a  federal court  complaint  against the\n\nUnited States and Major Owens.   The complaint alleges  that\n\nin October 1987 Major Owens told Mrs. Wood that he wanted to\n\ngo to a  hotel with her;  that later in  1987 he called  her\n\ninto  his office, \"grabbed  her arm, pulled  her toward him,\n\ncaressed her arm,  took lint  from her blouse  and said,  'I\n\nlike you, I like you  a lot and I  want to be intimate  with\n\nyou;'\" that in January 1988, he told her that he \"would like\n\nto have a relationship  together -- a sexual one;\"  and that\n\nin February 1988 he told her that she was not  right for the\n\njob  and would have to  leave.  Eventually,  for reasons not\n\nhere relevant,  the district  court dismissed  the complaint\n\ninsofar as it  charged violations  by the  United States  of\n\nvarious  specified provisions of federal and state law.  The\n\ncomplaint,  however,  also set  forth  state  law claims  of\n\nassault and  battery, and  civil  rights violations  against\n\nMajor Owens.  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 12,   11I.  The district\n                 \n\n                            -6-\n\ncourt  did not dismiss these state law claims, over which it\n\nretained diversity jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C.   1332.\n\n          The United States Attorney then filed (in what had\n\nbecome  a  state  law,  diversity  action)  a  Westfall  Act\n\ncertificate.   See  28  C.F.R.    15.3 (delegating  Attorney\n                  \n\nGeneral's  certification  authority  to  the  United  States\n\nAttorney).   It said that Owens, \"at all times referenced in\n\nthe  . . . Complaint,\"  was \"acting within  the scope of his\n\noffice  as a commissioned officer of the Armed forces of the\n\nUnited States.\"  In  an accompanying affidavit, Owens simply\n\ndenied Wood's factual allegations.  He said,\n\n          I never  spoke in a  sexually suggestive\n          manner  to plaintiff  nor did  I  at any\n          time ever proposition or  otherwise make\n          any sexual advances towards plaintiff.\n\nThe  United  States  Attorney,  denying  that  any  relevant\n\nincident  had occurred,  asked the  court to  substitute the\n\nUnited  States   for  Owens   as  defendant,  28   U.S.C.   \n\n2679(d)(1),  and (because  of  federal preemption  of  state\n\ncivil  rights law  and  a special  law preserving  sovereign\n\nimmunity  for intentional  torts) to  dismiss  the resulting\n\nclaims against the United States.  See 42 U.S.C.   2000e-16;\n                                      \n\n28 U.S.C.   2680(h).\n\n          The   district   court   would  not   permit   the\n\nsubstitution   because  it   believed   the   Westfall   Act\n\n                            -7-\n\ncertificate  was  inadequate.    It  pointed  out  that  the\n\ncomplaint  alleged facts,  which  (if  true)  showed  Owens'\n                  \n\nactions fell  outside his  \"scope of office  or employment.\"\n\nSee  28  U.S.C.     2671  (defining  \"scope  of  office   or\n   \n\nemployment\" to  mean a  military officer's \"line  of duty\");\n\nLutz v.

The  Provision's Language.   The Westfall Act\n                                        \n\nitself says that, to  provide immunity, the Attorney General\n\nmust certify that the  defendant employee was \"acting within\n                                                     \n\nthe scope  of his  office or employment  at the time  of the\n                                                            \n\nincident  out  of  which  the  claim  arose.\"     28  U.S.C.\n        \n\n  2679(d)(1).

The Westfall Act sets forth a Basic Statement of\n\nemployee  immunity  which  (edited to  emphasize  our point)\n\nsays,\n\n          [1] The remedy against the United States\n          provided by section [] 1346(b) . . . \n                                        \n\n          [2]  for  injury  .   .  .  arising   or\n          resulting from the negligent or wrongful\n          act or  omission of  any employee .  . .\n          while  acting  within the  scope  of his\n                                                  \n          office or employment\n                              \n\n          [3]  is exclusive  of  any  other  civil\n          action . . . for money damages by reason\n          of  the same subject  matter against the\n                                      \n          employee whose act or omission gave rise\n          to the claim . . . .\n\n28 U.S.C.    2679(b)(1) (emphasis  added).  Part  1 of  this\n\nstatement  cross-references  Section  1346(b)'s   waiver  of\n\nsovereign immunity.   Part 2 uses  language almost identical\n\nto that in Section  1346(b).  And, Part 3's  operative words\n\ngranting immunity from actions  seeking damages by reason of\n\nthe \"same subject matter\" would  therefore seem to refer, in\n\na  general way,  to  the respondeat  superior  circumstances\n                                             \n\nfound in the kind of suit that Section 1346(b) describes. \n\n          The  Westfall Act  subsection now  before  us uses\n\nsimilar language.   It  provides for substitution  where the\n\nAttorney General certifies that\n\n          the defendant employee was acting within\n          the scope of his office or employment at\n          the  time of the  incident out  of which\n\n                            -12-\n\n          the claim arose . . . \n                   \n\n28  U.S.C.    2679(d)(1)  (emphasis  added).   The  language\n\n\"acting within the scope of his office or employment\" tracks\n\nthe language  of Section  1346(b).   The  reference to  \"the\n\nclaim,\" appearing right after  the Basic Statement, seems to\n\nrefer to the Basic  Statement's kind of claim.   And, as  we\n\nhave  said, the Basic Statement,  in turn, refers to Section\n\n1346(b), which creates liability if there is  1) an \"injury\"\n\n2) \"caused by\" 3)  an employee's \"negligent or wrongful  act\n\nor omission,\" where 4) the employee  acted \"within the scope\n\nof office or employment,\" and 5) \"under circumstances\" where\n\nstate  law  would make  a  private  employer liable  for  an\n\nemployee's \"act or omission.\"\n\n          The  federal  government's  liability   under  the\n\nFederal Tort Claims Act is not perfectly congruent  with the\n\nfederal  employee's immunity  under the  Westfall Act.   The\n\nsovereign   immunity   waiver   contains    exceptions   and\n\nlimitations  that the  Westfall  Act does  not contain  (but\n\noutside of Section  1346(b)).

And,  the  federal government  may\n\nescape liability under Section 1346(b), even if the employee\n\nis immune, by asserting  state or federal law defenses.   28\n\nU.S.C.    2674.    Nonetheless, the  language  of the  basic\n\n\"government-liability-creating\"   and   \"employee-liability-\n\nremoving\"  provisions   makes  clear   that  both   sets  of\n\nprovisions involve  the same  basic kind  of case,  namely a\n                                        \n\nrespondeat superior kind of case.  And that fact is critical\n                   \n\nhere.  Since  Congress intended to limit  grants of immunity\n\nto job-related, respondeat  superior, kinds of  cases, there\n                                    \n\nis  no  reason  to apply  the  Westfall  Act  in cases  that\n\nconcededly do  not involve any kind  of potential respondeat\n                                                            \n\nsuperior liability.  Nor,  is there any reason to  interpret\n        \n\nthat  Act as  taking from  the jury  its traditional  job of\n\ndeciding whether an egregious  tort (well outside the \"scope\n\nof employment\"), in fact, occurred.\n\n          There  is, then,  no  reason to  give the  statute\n\nbefore us  other than  its natural  reading, a  reading that\n\n                            -14-\n\nrequires the  Attorney  General  to  assume  (for  immunity-\n                                           \n\nasserting  purposes), not  to deny,  the occurrence  of some\n                                  \n\n\"incident\" underlying  the plaintiff's claim.   The Attorney\n\nGeneral need not  deny the  incident to obtain  the kind  of\n            \n\njob-related immunity the statute seeks  to bestow.  And, the\n\nAttorney  General  should  not   be  able,  by  denying  the\n                         \n\nincident, to obtain  employee immunity for a tort claim that\n\nis not  job-related,  regardless  of  whether  the  Attorney\n\nGeneral believes the claim to be true or false.  \n\n          3.   Purpose.     One  can  imagine  why  Congress\n                      \n\ndecided  to link  employee immunity  to respondeat  superior\n                                                            \n\nprinciples as described.  Federal employee tort immunity has\n\na public,  not a  private,  objective, namely  the need  for\n\npublic employees faithfully to  discharge their duties.

The resulting\n                \n\nimmunity reflects a balancing of judgments, on the one hand,\n\nabout  the  likelihood  that potential  tort  liability will\n\n                            -15-\n\nadversely affect  job performance  and, on the  other, about\n\nthe potential harm such  immunity might cause potential tort\n\nplaintiffs.    That  balance  may differ  as  between  cases\n\ninside, and outside,  the scope of  employment.  After  all,\n\none might believe that employees  often can change their job\n\nperformance to  avoid, even unfounded, suits  based on, say,\n\nnegligent  performance of  that job,  but that  they  lack a\n\ncomparable ability to avoid, in a similar way, false charges\n\nof  an egregious tort (e.g.,  murder or assault).   And, the\n\npossible  effect  of  such  non-duty-related  suits  on  job\n\nperformance  might  seem  too  uncertain,  or  too  weak,  a\n\njustification for  depriving a plaintiff  of her right  to a\n\njury  trial  in cases  involving  non-duty-related egregious\n\ntorts.

Hence,  the  statute, as  enacted,\n\nsimply   reflects   different  Congressional   judgments  in\n\ndifferent circumstances.\n\n          As the  dissent suggests,  pp. 31, 34,  infra, our\n                                                       \n\ninterpretation means  that sometimes  Driver  A, who  admits\n\nnegligence will receive immunity, while less culpable Driver\n\n                            -16-\n\nB,  who denies the existence  of any accident  at all, would\n\nnot  receive immunity.   But,  this could  be so  only where\n\nDriver  A can  claim that  the underlying  incident is  job-\n\nrelated,  while  Driver  B  cannot  make  this  claim,  even\n\nhypothetically, for  argument's sake.  This  result does not\n\nseem anomalous given  immunity's job-related public purpose.\n\nAnd, it  is that  public purpose, not  relative culpability,\n\nthat controls the shape of the legal doctrine.\n\n                            -17-\n\n                             B\n\n                          History\n                                 \n\n          The Westfall  Act's history offers  direct support\n\nfor  our  reading  of   the  Act.    First,  the   House  of\n\nRepresentatives Report suggests that Congress did not intend\n\nthe Westfall Act to confer immunity for tort  claims outside\n\nthe respondeat superior  context.  It  simply says that  the\n                       \n\nAct  permits  substitution  of  the United  States  for  the\n\ndefendant employee \n\n          whenever the Attorney General determines\n          that the act or omission alleged to have\n          caused   the  claimant's   injuries  was\n          within  the  scope  of   the  employee's\n          office or employment.\n\nH.R. Rep. No.  700, 100th  Cong., 2d Sess.  9, reprinted  in\n                                                            \n\n1988  U.S.C.C.A.N. at  5952.   The Report  thereby seems  to\n\nassume the Section 1346(b) elements of an act that caused an\n\ninjury. \n\n          Second,  the Report  says  that the  Act does  not\n\npermit   substitution   where   the   conduct   alleged   is\n\n\"egregious:\"\n\n          [T]he United States will incur vicarious\n          liability only  for .  . .  torts . .  .\n          committed  within the  \"scope  of .  . .\n          employment.\"  If an employee  is accused\n          of  egregious  misconduct,  rather  than\n                                   \n          mere negligence or  poor judgment,  then\n          the United States may not be substituted\n          as  the  defendant,  and the  individual\n\n                            -18-\n\n          employee remains liable.\n\nId.  at 5, 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5949 (emphasis added).  This\n   \n\nlanguage suggests  that the Act  does not allow  an immunity\n                                         \n\ncertificate simply  to deny, say, an  alleged killing, rape,\n\nassault, or some  other \"egregious  misconduct\" that  occurs\n\nduring working hours.  It suggests that the Act requires the\n\ncertificate to explain, instead, why the alleged  misconduct\n\nwas not so \"egregious\" as to place it outside the employee's\n\n\"scope of employment.\"   The dissent's interpretation of the\n\nAct is inconsistent with this statement in the Report.\n\n          Third,  Congress  intended  the  Westfall  Act  to\n\nrestore  approximately the  federal  employee tort  immunity\n\nthat  existed prior to the Supreme Court case of Westfall v.\n                                                         \n\nErwin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111980\"><a href=\"/opinion/111980/westfall-v-erwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988).

Nothing  in the  Westfall Act's  history suggests\n\nthat Congress wanted to  change the pre-existing practice in\n\nthis respect.\n\n          Fourth,   the   Westfall  Act   changed  \"official\n\nimmunity\"  by overriding  the Supreme Court's  limitation of\n\nthe doctrine to \"discretionary  functions,\" 484 U.S. at 296-\n\n97, and by extending to  all federal employees a  procedural\n\nprotection   (the    certification   procedure)   previously\n\navailable only to government  drivers.  28 U.S.C.    2679(d)\n\n(1982) (amended by the Westfall Act).

Moreover, those  cases indicate  that\n\nDriver's Act \"immunity,\" like Westfall Act \"immunity,\" arose\n\nin a respondeat superior context.  See id. \n                                          \n\n          We recognize  that the Driver's  Act tied employee\n\nimmunity to  the  government's Section  1346(b),  respondeat\n                                                            \n\nsuperior liability  more explicitly  than does the  Westfall\n        \n\nAct,  for, in the context  of removal, the  Drivers Act said\n\nthat  if the  federal court  finds  (before trial)  that the\n\nplaintiff would  have no Section 1346(b)  remedy against the\n\nUnited States,  the \"case  shall  be remanded  to the  State\n\ncourt.\"    28  U.S.C.     2679(d)  (1982).

The district  court held  invalid a\n\nWestfall Act certificate that simply denied that the alleged\n\nevent had taken place.  See id. at 913.  \n                               \n\n          Language,  context, history, and precedent lead to\n\nthe same  general  conclusions.   1) The  immunity that  the\n\nWestfall Act  confers upon federal employees  arises in, and\n\nis confined  to, a  certain context, namely  the \"respondeat\n                                                            \n\nsuperior\"  context, described roughly  in Section 1346(b) of\n        \n\nthe Federal  Tort Claims Act.   2) To permit  a Westfall Act\n\ncertificate  simply  to deny  that  anything occurred  would\n\nextend a form of this  immunity well outside the \"respondeat\n                                                            \n\n                            -23-\n\nsuperior\" context to  \"egregious\" torts allegedly  committed\n        \n\nat  work.   It would  permit, to  a significant  degree, the\n\nAttorney General  and district judge (rather  than the jury)\n\nto decide whether allegations of such non-work-related torts\n\nwere  true  or false.   3)  We  therefore conclude  that the\n\ncertificate cannot assert \"immunity\" simply by  denying that\n\nanything occurred.   We read  the statute to  mean what  its\n\nwords  naturally  say, namely  that  the Attorney  General's\n\ncertificate must assume the existence of an \"incident out of\n\nwhich the claim arose.\"  \n\n                            III\n\n        What \"Incident\" Must the Certificate Assume?\n                                                   \n\n          We  are aware  of one  important question  that we\n\nhave not yet  asked or answered.   Given our interpretation,\n\ncould a plaintiff, through artful pleading, transform a job-\n\nrelated tort into a non-job-related tort simply by alleging,\n\nsay an \"off-duty\" state of mind (such as \"malicious\" intent)\n\nor  by alleging  that  a negligent  action  was carried  out\n\nintentionally?    If so,  will  federal  employees lose,  in\n\npractice, the  job-related  immunity that  Congress  clearly\n\nintended the Westfall Act to provide?\n\n          Consider,  for example,  an  accident  victim  who\n\nmight  normally file  a suit  charging negligence.

First, after\n\noral  argument  in  this  case the  Fourth  Circuit  decided\n\nJohnson v. Carter, No. 90-3077 (4th Cir., Jan. 15, 1993), in\n                 \n\nwhich  it held  that  courts cannot  review the  validity of\n\nWestfall  Act certificates.  Id.  at 7.   We previously have\n                                \n\nheld to the contrary.   Kelly v. United States,  924 F.2d at\n                                              \n\n357; Nasuti, 906  F.2d at 812.

And, we shall not do so.\n\n          Second,  the  Government  originally   appealed  a\n\ntotally separate issue, whether or not federal law preempted\n\ncertain  of Wood's state law  claims.  The  panel refused to\n\nconsider that aspect  of the  appeal on the  ground that  an\n\ninterlocutory appeal  did not lie from  the district court's\n\ndecision of that question.

We do not see how it\n\ncould  characterize the  incidents at  issue in  a way  that\n\nwould  bring them within defendant's \"line  of duty,\" and it\n\nhas  not tried to  do so.  We  consequently believe that the\n\ndistrict court's decision denying substitution and dismissal\n\nwas correct, and that decision is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                            -30-\n\n    COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge, SELYA  and BOUDIN, Circuit\n                                                            \n\nJudges,  dissenting.1    In  this  case  a  federal  employee\n     \n\ncharged  with  an  intentional  tort said  that  the  alleged\n\nincidents never  occurred, and the Attorney  General issued a\n\n\"scope of employment\" certificate  under the Westfall Act, 28\n\nU.S.C.    2679, accepting  the employee's version  of events.\n\nIn  our  view, the  Attorney  General's  scope of  employment\n\ncertificate must be respected unless  and until set aside  by\n\nthe district court; and the certificate can be set aside only\n\nif the  judge determines--in this case,  after an evidentiary\n            \n\nhearing  to decide  whether the incidents  occurred--that the\n\nemployee engaged in improper conduct outside the scope of his\n\nemployment.\n\n                             I.\n\n    In the Westfall Act,  Congress told the Attorney General\n\nto  determine whether  to  certify that  a federal  employee,\n\nagainst  whom a civil suit has been filed, was acting \"within\n\nthe scope  of his  office or employment  at the  time of  the\n\nincident out  of which the claim arose . .  . .\"  28 U.S.C.  \n\n2679(d)(1), (2).  Where  this certificate issues, the statute\n\ndirects that the  case, if initially brought  in state court,\n\nshall be removed to federal court  and in any event that \"the\n\nUnited States  shall be substituted as  the party defendant.\"\n\n                   \n\n    1This opinion represents the work, as well as the views,\nof all three judges so we have signed it jointly.\n\n                            -28-\n                             28\n\nId.

The statute does not address, and thereby leaves\n\nopen, the possibility that  where the Attorney General grants\n\na  certificate, it may be  reviewed so far  as it substitutes\n\nthe United States for the employee. \n\n    On   February   8,   1990,   the   U.S.   Attorney   for\n\nMassachusetts,  who  is  delegated  authority to  issue  such\n\ncertificates,  28  C.F.R.     15.3,  issued  a  Westfall  Act\n\ncertificate in this  case affirming that  Owens at all  times\n\nreferenced in the complaint was \"acting with the scope of his\n\noffice . . . .\"   The  United States then  substituted itself\n\nfor Owens.  Needless to say, the government has never claimed\n\nthat the incidents,  if they occurred as  Wood alleged, would\n\nbe behavior within the  scope of Owens' duties.   Rather, the\n\ncertificate amounts  to an  assertion that  Owens was at  all\n\ntimes acting within the scope  of his employment because,  in\n                                                       \n\nthe Attorney General's view,  the incidents did not occur  as\n\nalleged by Wood.\n\n    Accordingly,  we  now  face  a situation  in  which  the\n\nAttorney General's delegate has  issued a certificate and the\n\nplaintiff  has sought to set  it aside.   One option--that of\n\nsimply  assuming   the  certificate  to  be   true  (and  the\n\ncomplaint's allegations  false)--we reject.   This court  has\n\nheld that the grant  of a scope certificate is  reviewable as\n\n                            -29-\n                             29\n\nto substitution because any other reading could foreclose the\n\nplaintiff's  claim without a  judicial determination.

Such  an  assumption  would  give  the\n\nplaintiff complete control over the certification process and\n\npermit the  certificate to be nullified  without any judicial\n\nfinding.    The  statute  permits a  certificate  where  \"the\n\ndefendant employee was acting within the scope of his  office\n\nor employment at  the time of the  incident . . . .\"   In our\n\nview, this language speaks not to what plaintiff or defendant\n\nmay  allege  but  rather  to  the  actual  events  and  their\n          \n\nconnection to the employee's office or employment.\n\n    Finally,  to  us it  is of  no  moment that  the statute\n\nrefers to \"the incident out of which the claim arose.\"  It is\n\nan  accident of  language--a  reflection of  the most  common\n\ncase--that the  statute posits a  \"happening.\"  In  this case\n\nthe  Attorney  General   concluded,  as   evidenced  by   the\n\ncertificate,  that the  events claimed  by plaintiff  did not\n\n                   \n\n    2That  is  so,  for  example,  where  the  Westfall  Act\nmandates substitution  but  the tort  is  one for  which  the\nUnited States has not waived its sovereign immunity.\n\n                            -30-\n                             30\n\noccur, at least in the form alleged  by Wood.  But it is  not\n\ndifficult  to find here  a set of  \"incidents\" or occurrences\n\nconceded  by   everyone:    Owens  did   have  a  supervisory\n\nrelationship with Wood,  met and talked  with her on  various\n\noccasions  and danced with her at an official function.  What\n\nis  disputed is  precisely what  was said  and done  on these\n\noccasions,  much  as  a   government  driver  and  a  private\n\nplaintiff  might  give two  quite  different  versions of  an\n\naccident.\n\n    Indeed, we think  the Westfall Act  would apply even  if\n\nthere were less of an \"incident\" than is indisputably present\n              \n\nin this case.   For example, surely the statute  applies with\n\nthe same force whether  a postal service driver says  that he\n\ndid not hit the plaintiff's car or that he did so but was not\n\nat fault.   \"Incident,\" in  other words,  must encompass  the\n\npossibility  that something  did not  happen as  well  as the\n\npossibility that it did.\n\n    Against  this background, we confront a single question:\n\nshould the judge or  the jury make the  initial determination\n\nas to  what  did or  did not  occur and  its relationship  to\n\nOwens'  office or  employment?   The  case  is peculiar  only\n\nbecause  the  same issue  happens to  be  common both  to the\n\nvalidity  of  the  certificate  and  to  the  merits  of  the\n\ncontroversy  between  plaintiff  and  defendant.    If  Owens\n\nmolested  Wood, the certificate is  invalid and he is liable;\n                                              \n\n                            -31-\n                             31\n\nif it never happened  and he maintained a  proper supervisor-\n\nemployee relationship,  then  his behavior  toward  Wood  was\n\nwithin the scope of his employment and he has no liability.\n                                     \n\n                            II.\n\n    Although the question  of who should decide  is not free\n\nfrom doubt, we believe that the Attorney General's\n\ncertificate cannot be set aside unless and until the district\n\njudge concludes that Wood's version of events  is correct and\n\ntherefore that  Owens could not  have been acting  within the\n\nscope of his employment.  This course appears to us to be the\n\none most consistent  with statutory language,  with Congress'\n\npolicy,  with Supreme  Court  and other  precedent, and  with\n\nsound administration of the statute.  Each of these points is\n\naddressed in turn.\n\n    We  start  with   the  statute's  language,  as   proper\n\ninterpretation   requires.

As  we have noted,  there is\n\nnothing in the statute that requires the  Attorney General or\n\nthe court to accept the plaintiff's version of events as true\n\nwithout   scrutiny  (and   such   a  requirement   would   be\n\nsufficiently  odd that a  court could not  lightly infer it).\n\nNor  is  there  anything  that prevents  a  certificate  from\n\nissuing where the \"incident\" charged in the complaint did not\n\noccur  and  the defendant  engaged  only  in proper  behavior\n\noccurring  wholly   within  the   scope  of  his   office  or\n\nemployment.  In sum, so far as the statute is concerned, this\n                                         \n\nis a proper certificate, unless  and until a factual  finding\n\nin Wood's favor undermines the premise of the certificate.\n\n    It  is even  clearer  that  the  congressional  policies\n\nunderlying the statute support the government's position.  At\n\npresent,  Owens is  not presumed  to be a  molester; he  is a\n\nmilitary  officer who  has  been accused  of making  improper\n\nadvances to an employee  whom he supervised in the  course of\n\nhis official duties.  To issue his certificate,  the Attorney\n\nGeneral must have  concluded that in  this case the  advances\n\n                            -33-\n                             33\n\nwere not  made.    Where the  Attorney General  has issued  a\n\nscope  certificate, Congress intended  to spare employees not\n\nonly from liability for  misconduct related to their official\n\nduties but also from the burden and expense of defending such\n              \n\nsuits.3 \n\n    In  other  words,  the  Westfall  Act  is  not a  simple\n\nimmunity statute saying that  certain misconduct is protected\n\nagainst  liability and  leaving the  employee to  assert that\n\nimmunity in litigation.  Rather, by its precise terms and its\n\nunderlying  policy, the statute meant to lift the case into a\n\nfederal  forum and  relieve the  employee  from the  cost and\n\neffort of defending  the case if the  Attorney General issues\n                               \n\nthe certificate.4  A certificate having issued in this  case,\n\nsurely  Owens should  not  be deprived  of  the advantage  of\n\nhaving the  government defend the  case, a protection  that a\n\nnegligent postal employee would gain as a matter of course.\n\n    Turning  to precedent,  the  Supreme Court  has not  yet\n\n                   \n\n    3The  Supreme  Court  has  been  equally  concerned,  in\nfashioning  immunity  doctrine, with  \"the  general costs  of\nsubjecting officials to  the risks  of trial--distraction  of\nofficials  from  their  governmental  duties,  inhibition  of\ndiscretionary action,  and  deterrence of  able  people  from\npublic service.\"   Harlow  v.

With respect, this statement is buried at\n\nthe end of a  long opinion addressed to different  issues and\n\nmay  well  be  qualified  by the  sentence  that  immediately\n\nfollows.  Id. at 74.   It is by no means clear that the court\n           \n\nthought it was deciding the issue presented in this case, and\n\nit certainly gave  no reasons for deciding it one  way or the\n\nother, which  strongly reinforces  the inference that  it did\n\nnot intend to decide the issue at all.\n\n    Finally, while this is the least weighty  of reasons, we\n\nthink that the  reading urged  by the government  is the  one\n\nmost consistent with sound administration of the statute.  It\n\nseems quite  likely that  the evidentiary hearing  before the\n\ndistrict  judge  would  be  an efficient  course:  if  Owens'\n\nversion  of  events were  accepted  after  the hearing,  that\n\nfinding would  sustain  the certificate  and  (by  collateral\n\nestoppel) dispose of Wood's  claim on the merits at  the same\n\ntime.  If instead Wood's version were accepted, then we think\n\n                            -36-\n                             36\n\nOwens would similarly  be bound  by the result;  he would  be\n\nresubstituted  as a  defendant,  and the  case would  proceed\n\nbefore  a jury  on other  unadjudicated issues,  such as  the\n\nissue of damages.6\n\n    By contrast,  under  the majority's  approach,  district\n\ncourts--and ultimately this court--will continue to engage in\n\ndifficult, time-wasting controversies  (like this one)  about\n\nprecisely which  facts pertaining to the  scope of employment\n                     \n\nissue are for the district judge and which  are for the jury.\n\nHair   splitting  distinctions  and  anomalous  results  will\n\nmultiply.7    If  Congress  commanded this  course,  then  it\n\nshould be  obeyed.  But  there is no reason  to inflict these\n\nhardships  upon  ourselves  and  the  judicial  process  when\n\nCongress' statute  and its policy  both look in  the opposite\n\ndirection.\n\n                            III.\n\n                   \n\n    6If  the  employee is  content  to  have the  government\nsubstitute itself  for him  to  defend his  conduct, then  we\nthink   that  his   interests   and   the  government's   are\nsufficiently  aligned  for  collateral  estoppel  to  operate\nagainst him.  See Montana v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110022\"><a href=\"/opinion/110022/montana-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154\n                                         \n(1979) (one who assists  in the prosecution or defense  of an\naction  in aid  of  some  interest  of  his  own  is  bound);\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments   39.\n\n    7For example, suppose Wood said she had been offensively\ntouched but Owens said he touched her only accidentally as he\nwas handing her a  stack of correspondence.  If  the Attorney\nGeneral  then  granted  a  certificate,  there  would  be  an\n\"incident\" and a clear scope of employment issue.  Presumably\nthe certificate  could not be  set aside  without a  district\ncourt factual  finding.    Why  this  case  should  follow  a\ndifferent procedural course is hard to understand.\n\n                            -37-\n                             37\n\n         The  arguments  against the  resolution  we propose\n\nshould be  faced  head on.    The main  adverse  consequence,\n\nperhaps the  only practical argument against  our reading, is\n\nthat it  deprives the plaintiff of trial  by jury on an issue\n\nthat  goes to  the heart  of the  merits, as  well as  to the\n\nvalidity  of the  certificate.   That  common issue,  turning\n\ndirectly  on credibility in this case, may be well suited for\n\njury resolution.  This is not a small objection; the right to\n\njury  trial  as at  common law  is  preserved by  the Seventh\n\nAmendment  itself.   While the  Seventh Amendment  ex proprio\n                                                            \n\nvigore  does not apply in this case, courts are protective of\n     \n\njury trial,  e.g., Pernell v.  Southall Realty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109014\"><a href=\"/opinion/109014/pernell-v-southall-realty/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                                             \n\n(1974), and do not  lightly read an ambiguous statute  to cut\n\noff the opportunity of a litigant to obtain a jury.8\n\n    Yet under the Westfall Act the inevitable and deliberate\n\neffect of what  Congress has done is to supplant the jury for\n                                   \n\nall  cases within the  ken of  that statute,  including cases\n\nwhere the scope question goes to the heart of the merits.

Under our reading of\n     \n\nthe statute, the plaintiff simply gets an adjudication on one\n\nissue by the  trial judge  instead of a  jury, with  adequate\n\ndiscovery  and full opportunity  to present and cross-examine\n\nwitnesses, which is the  way that plaintiffs normally proceed\n\nagainst  the government.    And given  that substitution  has\n\noccurred, this is  a case against  the government unless  and\n                \n\nuntil the certificate is set aside.  \n\n    With  respect,  the  more  technical  arguments  of  the\n\nmajority seem to  us unpersuasive.   In framing the  Westfall\n\nAct, Congress no doubt had in mind the classic  case in which\n\n\"the  wrongdoing\" (if it occurred) was the type for which the\n\ngovernment  would  be responsible  under  respondeat superior\n                                                            \n\n                            -39-\n                             39\n\ndoctrine.    But  a claim  of  perfect  symmetry between  the\n\ncertifiable  conduct (under the  Westfall Act) and government\n\nliability (under the Federal Tort Claims Act) is refuted, and\n\ndefinitively so, by United  States v. Smith, 111 S.  Ct. 1180\n                                          \n\n(1991).   Smith  held  that the  Westfall  Act immunizes  the\n              \n\nemployee  for conduct within the scope  of employment even if\n                                                            \n\nthere is no  remedy against the United States.

No. 700, supra, p. 6.\n                             \n\n    Similarly, it seems to us beside the point that Congress\n\nplainly did not intend to grant immunity to employees who act\n\negregiously.   Owens  has not  been  found to  have  molested\n                                         \n\nanyone;  he is  charged  with misconduct,  just  as a  postal\n                      \n\nemployee might  be accused  of  negligent driving  or an  FBI\n\nagent of assault during the arrest of a suspect.  If Owens is\n\nfound by the district judge to have engaged in harassment, he\n\nwill  not have immunity and will be personally liable.  Until\n\nthat  happens, the  certificate  affords him  the  procedural\n\nadvantages of government substitution and representation.\n\n    The majority also  relies upon the  House Report on  the\n\nWestfall  Act, which states that \"[i]f an employee is accused\n\nof  egregious  misconduct,  rather than  negligence  or  poor\n\njudgment, then the  United States may  not be substituted  as\n\nthe  defendant, and the  individual employee remains liable.\"\n\nH.

There is no hint that Congress\n                     \n\nmeant to  place any weight on  the word \"accused.\"   From the\n\n                            -40-\n                             40\n\nprior  and succeeding  sentences, it  appears that  the House\n\nReport  was simply  assuring readers  that the  United States\n\nwould  not take  on the  burden of  paying for  the egregious\n\ntorts  of employees  plainly committed  outside the  scope of\n\nemployment.   See id.   That result will  be achieved whether\n                    \n\nthe judge  or jury makes  the initial  determination of  what\n\nhappened.\n\n    Finally,  the  majority's broadest  but  we  think least\n\npersuasive argument is its  intimation that Congress would be\n\ndismayed  to  discover that  its  statute  applied to  Owens.\n\nCertainly Congress  would be shocked if  harassment were held\n\nto  be covered by official immunity, but no one is suggesting\n\nthat it is.  Congress  could not be shocked to  discover that\n\nits statute  might apply where intentional  harm was charged,\n\nsince intentional  harm clearly is  covered in some  cases.9 \n\nThe  reality  is that  Congress in  this  case, as  with many\n\nstatutes, probably did not  think one way or the  other about\n\nunusual applications, and it is an illusion to think that one\n\nknows just what Congress  would have thought if it  had faced\n\nthe precise issue in this case.\n\n    In such cases, the court's job is not to speculate about\n\n                   \n\n    9Notably, the Federal Tort  Claims Act itself waives the\ngovernment's  sovereign  immunity  for  claims   of  assault,\nbattery  and false imprisonment  by law enforcement officers.\n28  U.S.C.     2679(h).    It  must  be  undisputed  that  an\nindividual FBI agent,  if sued for assault during  an arrest,\ncould obtain a valid Westfall Act certificate.\n\n                            -41-\n                             41\n\nlegislative intent that never  existed.  Rather, our  task is\n\nto  piece out the statutory edifice as best we can, \"giv[ing]\n\ncoherence to what Congress has done within the bounds imposed\n\nby a fair reading  of [the] legislation.\"  Achilli  v. United\n                                                            \n\nStates,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105506\"><a href=\"/opinion/105506/achilli-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 379  (1957).    And  if Congress  is\n     \n\ndispleased when it sees how its general language  and purpose\n\nhave been fitted  to the case, it is  always open to Congress\n\nto refine its statute.\n\n  Having stated our view as to what the statute requires, we\n\nwant to make clear that the charge made by Wood against Owens\n\nis a very serious one involving--if the allegations are true-\n\n-multiple abuses of Owens'  position as a government official\n\nas  well as  continuing sexual harassment.   Nothing  in this\n\nopinion  should  suggest that  Wood's  version  of events  is\n\nunsubstantial  or implausible.  We  simply do not  know:  The\n\nAttorney General's certificate  may be well founded or it may\n\nrest on a faulty  factual premise.  Our concern is  simply to\n\nhave the validity of  the certificate and the correctness  of\n\nits  premise  determined  swiftly   and  at  the  outset,  in\n\naccordance with Congress' statutory plan.\n\n  For the reasons stated,  we would vacate the order  of the\n\ndistrict court and remand the case for an evidentiary hearing\n\nto  determine whether Owens, in  his conduct vis  a vis Wood,\n\nacted solely within the scope of his office or employment.\n\n                            -42-\n                             42\n</pre>",
