The district court entered summary\n\njudgment for defendants due to plaintiff's failure to meet the\n\nCopyright Act's three-year statute of limitations in this dispute\n\nover   profits   from   the   sale   of    Hummel   figurines    and   images.\n\nCambridge Literary Properties, Ltd. v. W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik\n\nG.m.b.H. & Co. Kg. (Cambridge II), 448 F. Supp. 2d 244 (D. Mass.\n\n2006).   We affirm.\n\n           The key facts are set forth here and in our earlier\n\nopinion on a different issue in this case.              Cambridge Literary\n\nProperties, Ltd. v. W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. & Co. Kg.\n\n(Cambridge I), 295 F.3d 59, 61-62 (1st Cir. 2002).                 Plaintiff\n\nCambridge Literary Properties, Ltd. seeks a share of the profits\n\nreaped by defendants W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. & Co. Kg.\n\nand Goebel Art G.m.b.H. (collectively, \"Goebel\") for the use of\n\nimages taken from a German book published in 1934, Das Hummel-Buch,\n\nin which Cambridge asserts a copyright interest.                Specifically,\n\nCambridge, which acquired its purported \"rights\" from two sets of\n\nheirs of a putative joint author of the book, seeks an accounting\n\nand imposition of trust on past and future profits Goebel realizes\n\nfrom the distribution of figurines derived from the book, Goebel's\n\nuse of the particular figure of \"The Merry Wanderer\" as its\n\ntrademark or logo, the membership fees in the M. I. Hummel Club in\n\nthe United States, and the like.           Whether Cambridge in fact is a\n\nco-owner, through co-authorship, of any of its asserted rights is\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fhotly contested by Goebel in its summary judgment papers and its\n\nbrief on appeal.          Indeed, Cambridge's complaint asserts facts\n\nacknowledging Goebel's claims of sole ownership.\n\n            The federal courts clearly have jurisdiction over this\n\ncase.     Cambridge chose to file the action in federal district\n\ncourt, and jurisdiction has never been at issue.                    We affirm the\n\ndistrict    court's      grant    of   summary    judgment,         affirming     the\n\nrecommendation of the magistrate judge.            Plaintiff's ownership of\n\nany interest, as we have said, is hotly disputed, and is an issue\n\ngoverned    by   the    Copyright      Act.     There    is    no    agreement     or\n\nstipulation      of    ownership.       Yet   Cambridge       did    not   seek    an\n\nadjudication of its ownership rights before seeking whatever remedy\n\nit may have if it has any ownership rights.             Thus, this case is not\n\na dispute between admitted co-owners.                   Rather, the complaint\n\nattempts to evade the issue of whether Cambridge has any ownership\n\nrights by simply asserting that Cambridge is a co-owner and then\n\nalleging that Cambridge, as a co-owner, is entitled under state law\n\nto an accounting and equitable trust.               As a result, Cambridge\n\nargues,    the   federal    statute     of    limitations      that    applies     to\n\nestablishing copyright ownership under the Copyright Act does not\n\napply; rather, the state statute of limitations for an accounting\n\napplies.\n\n            The accounting and equitable trust claims created by\n\nstate law are premature.         Such claims may well be governed by state\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\flaw, but they are not ripe and necessarily rest upon plaintiff\n\nhaving met the antecedent showing that it has ownership rights\n\nunder the Copyright Act.    Plaintiff may not assert the state-law\n\nclaims for accounting or equitable trust without establishing that\n\nit is a co-owner.   Whether Cambridge is a co-owner in turn depends,\n\non the facts of this case,1 upon the federal Copyright Act.     This\n\nin turn requires that Cambridge have asserted its ownership claims\n\nwithin that statute's limitations period. The congressional intent\n\nthat the Act's limitations period applies to claims of ownership\n\nunder the Act may not be undercut by Cambridge's subterfuge.2\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          Not all claims of co-ownership will arise under the\nCopyright Act, and our decision does not affect such cases. For\nexample, at times, whether there is co-ownership may be determined\nby the terms of a contract governed by state law or through other\nownership interests governed by state law and thus not require\napplication of the Copyright Act. See, e.g., Royal v. Leading Edge\nProds., Inc., 833 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1987) (rejecting federal\nquestion jurisdiction where claim of co-ownership, \"in its very\nnature and essence, [was] one for breach of contract\" under state\nlaw).   In other cases, such as where co-ownership results from\npurported statutory co-authorship, the question of co-ownership is\ngoverned by the Copyright Act. See 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer\non Copyright § 12.01[A][1][b] (2007) (endorsing view that in an\naction seeking declaratory judgment of plaintiff as co-author and\nfor an accounting, federal jurisdiction is exclusive because\n\"copyright ownership by reason of one's status as co-author arises\ndirectly from the terms of the Copyright Act itself\"); see also\nGaiman v. McFarlane, 360 F.3d 644, 652-53 (7th Cir. 2004)\n(collecting cases).\n     2\n          We do not hold, nor is it a ramification of our holding,\nthat federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to\nadjudicate all accounting claims between the co-owners of a\ncopyrighted work.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f            Under    the    Act,    the   cause   of   action     accrues   when   a\n\nplaintiff \"knows or has reason to know of the act which is the\n\nbasis of the claim.\"         Santa-Rosa v. Combo Records, 471 F.3d 224,\n\n227 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 2265 (2007) (internal\n\nquotation omitted).          We reject plaintiff's novel approach to\n\naccrual.     Cambridge may not escape the limitations bar if the\n\nstatute barred the claims of the heirs from which it acquired the\n\n\"rights.\"        Young v. Lepone, 305 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nCambridge is also barred if it failed to timely act within the\n\nlimitations period after it acquired the rights.                  Here, Cambridge\n\nand the heirs, on the undisputed facts, were put on sufficient\n\nnotice to result in accrual more than three years before plaintiff\n\ninstituted suit.      Further, there is no basis for equitable tolling\n\nof the three-year limitations period.\n\n                                          I.\n\n            In describing the facts of the dispute, we make all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of Cambridge, the party opposing\n\nsummary judgment.        T-Peg, Inc. v. Vermont Timber Works, Inc., 459\n\nF.3d 97, 102 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Berta Hummel, as a young woman in Germany in the early\n\n20th century, had a talent for drawing images of children in folk\n\ndress.      In   1931,     Hummel   took    her   vows   as   a   member    of   the\n\nCongregation of Franciscan Sisters at the Convent of Siessen\n\n(\"Convent\") and became Sister Maria Innocentia Hummel.                      Sister\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fHummel and the Convent published some of Sister Hummel's drawings\n\nas postcards and devotional pictures.\n\n          In 1934, a German publishing company, Emil Fink Verlag\n\n(\"Fink\"), approached Sister Hummel and the Convent about publishing\n\nsome of Sister Hummel's artworks in a book.       In May of that year,\n\nSister Hummel, the Superior of the Convent, and Fink entered into\n\nan agreement authorizing Fink to reproduce forty of Sister Hummel's\n\nworks in Das Hummel-Buch.      The contract specified that the book\n\nwould include, in addition to the drawings, poems and other text.\n\nAbout six months later, Fink contracted with Margarete Seemann, a\n\nViennese poet, for the production of an introduction and fifty\n\npoems for use in the book.\n\n          Fink   first   published   Das   Hummel-Buch   in   Germany   in\n\nDecember 1934.   Fink applied to the United States Copyright Office\n\nfor a copyright in the book in June 1936.     Fink's application lists\n\nEmil Fink Verlag as the \"copyright owner,\" and Hummel and Seemann\n\nas \"author[s] or translator[s].\"\n\n          Back in Germany, Fink was not the only firm seeking to\n\ncommercialize Sister Hummel's drawings.        Franz Goebel, then the\n\nhead of Goebel, also entered into a contract with Sister Hummel and\n\nthe Convent in January 1935.    In that contract, Sister Hummel and\n\nthe Convent assigned to Goebel the exclusive right to manufacture\n\nand market porcelain figurines based on Sister Hummel's drawings.\n\nGoebel continues to produce its line of \"M. I. Hummel figurines\" to\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthis day.   Goebel Art, a wholly owned subsidiary of Goebel, acts as\n\nthe exclusive distributor and licensing agent for Goebel's United\n\nStates copyright interests derived from the 1935 contract.                  In\n\naddition to the sale of figurines, Goebel also profits from the\n\nHummel copyrights through Goebel Art's \"M. I. Hummel Club,\" which\n\ngenerates substantial income from membership fees.\n\n            In June 1962, Fink applied for a renewal copyright in\n\n\"Das Hummel-Buch, by Berta Hummel . . . [preface and verses by]\n\nMargarete   Seemann.\"       The    publishing     house   listed   itself   as\n\n\"proprietor of copyright in a work made for hire.\"           In 1971, Goebel\n\npurchased   all   of   Fink's     copyrights     in   Hummel-related   works,\n\nincluding the American copyright in Das Hummel-Buch. That sale was\n\nalso memorialized in documents filed with the Copyright Office.\n\n            Goebel was not always the sole American distributor of\n\nHummel figurines.       Until the mid-1990s, Goebel contracted with\n\nSchmid Brothers, Inc. (\"Schmid\") to distribute the figurines in the\n\nUnited States.    Schmid and Goebel quarreled repeatedly over their\n\nbusiness arrangement in the courts of Germany and the United\n\nStates.     Sometime in the late 1960s, an attorney named Henry\n\nHerrmann began working for Schmid on matters related to disputes\n\nwith   Goebel.    By    1971,   Herrmann   had    obtained   for   Schmid   an\n\nassignment of copyrights from Sister Hummel's family; Sister Hummel\n\nhad died in 1946.      Herrmann also represented Schmid in a number of\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\flawsuits pertaining to the Hummel rights.             Herrman is the driving\n\nforce behind Cambridge in the present dispute.\n\n           In 1992, during a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District\n\nof New York, Schmid and Goebel entered into a consent judgment that\n\nstated that the two parties owned \"respective undivided one-half\n\ninterests in the United States renewal copyright in [Das Hummel-\n\nBuch].\"   Herrmann executed the agreement on behalf of Schmid.\n\n           Schmid, which held interests in Das Hummel-Buch, filed\n\nfor bankruptcy in 1993.      Herrmann, as a creditor in the bankruptcy\n\nproceedings,    filed   a   claim    for    over    $10,000,000    based      on   a\n\ncontingency fee agreement with his former client. Herrmann settled\n\nhis claim for $3,750,000.       Goebel, for its part, acquired Schmid's\n\nrights to the book in the wake of Schmid's bankruptcy.                  With that\n\nacquisition, Goebel's ownership interest in the United States\n\ncopyright to Das Hummel-Buch appeared to be perfected.\n\n           At   some    point   during      the    Goebel-Schmid    litigation,\n\nHerrmann came to think that Margarete Seemann's heirs might retain\n\nan interest in the United States copyright for Das Hummel-Buch\n\nbecause Seemann's poems appear in the book.              In order to exploit\n\nthat interest, Herrmann sought an assignment of copyright interests\n\nfrom Seemann's heirs.       Herrmann formed Cambridge in August 1995 to\n\neffectuate   that   purpose.        Herrmann      continues   to   be   the   sole\n\nshareholder in Cambridge in addition to representing the company in\n\nthis litigation.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           Also in 1995, Herrmann identified Seemann's heirs and\n\nassignees of Seemann's alleged United States copyright interests in\n\nDas Hummel-Buch. They were Maria Romanowicz, a resident of Vienna,\n\nand Dr. Alexandrine Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic, a resident of Belgrade.\n\nHerrmann approached both heirs in August and September of 1995 with\n\noffers to purchase such United States copyright interests as they\n\nheld in the book.\n\n           On September 6, 1995, Maria Romanowicz signed a contract\n\nassigning to Cambridge all of her \"right, title and interest in and\n\nto any and all United States Copyright Renewals in any of the works\n\nauthored   and/or    co-authored    by     [Seemann],   including,    without\n\nlimitation,   the    work   'Das   Hummel-Buch.'\"       The    contract   also\n\nspecified that \"included in this assignment are any and all of my\n\nlegal and/or equitable monetary claims and causes of action I may\n\nhave under American laws as of the date hereof for payments . . .\n\nand/or accountings against third parties\" for their exploitation of\n\nthe United States copyright to Das Hummel-Buch.               As to the other\n\nheir, although Herrmann first approached Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic in\n\n1995, he did not obtain an assignment from her to Cambridge until\n\nFebruary 1999.      The terms of the second assignment were identical\n\nto the first.\n\n           Having thus assembled what it represented to be a fifty-\n\npercent interest (based on any interest held by the poet Seemann)\n\nin the United States copyright to Das Hummel-Buch, Cambridge filed\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthe current action in the District of Massachusetts in February\n\n2000, basing jurisdiction on diversity and, conditionally, on\n\nfederal question jurisdiction.3          Cambridge's complaint pleaded two\n\n\"claims\":    one for \"an accounting from [Goebel] of their profits\n\nfrom their use and benefit of said book and the two and three\n\ndimensional works derived therefrom\"; and a separate claim for\n\nunjust enrichment seeking as a remedy \"restitution and [] a decree\n\nimposing a constructive trust . . . on [Goebel's] intellectual\n\nproperty relating to the works derived from the [b]ook.\"                  The\n\ncomplaint states, in conclusory fashion, that Cambridge is entitled\n\nto   these   remedies   due   to   its   status   as   \"joint   legal   and/or\n\nbeneficial owner[] of the United States Renewal Copyright\" in Das\n\nHummel-Buch.4\n\n\n      3\n          The complaint states that the District of Massachusetts\n\"has diversity jurisdiction . . . pursuant to [28 U.S.C.\n§ 1332(a)]\" and \"[f]urther, if this action were determined to be\narising under Federal copyright statutes, this Court has\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1338.\" Am. Compl.\n¶¶ 16-17.\n      4\n          At the same time, however, the complaint concedes that\nGoebel and other parties had previously asserted the ownership\nrights to the United States copyright in Das Hummel-Buch without\never acknowledging any ownership interest by Seemann or her heirs.\nSee, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 44-45 (\"Goebel, claiming as alleged owner\nof the Book Renewal . . . has previously, in a United States\nDistrict Court, made claim for alleged infringement of the Book\nRenewal.\"); id. ¶ 66 (alleging that a 1992 federal court consent\ndecree named Schmid and a Goebel subsidiary \"undivided joint owners\nof the Book Renewal\").     Similarly, the complaint reveals that\nGoebel had previously represented the contents of the book as\n\"works for hire\" rather than \"joint works,\" which would mean that\neven if Seemann held the copyright in her poems, her rights would\nnot extend to Hummel's illustrations. Am. Compl. ¶ 44.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            Cambridge   does    not    claim     it   owns     any   independent\n\ncopyright   interests   in     any    images    created   by    Sister   Hummel.\n\nRather, it says its rights are derivative from Seemann.5                 Seemann,\n\nCambridge alleges, obtained an interest in the United States\n\ncopyright for Das Hummel-Buch by virtue of her co-author status\n\nwith Hummel and/or Fink.       Cambridge alleges the book was a \"joint\n\nwork\" between Hummel and Seemann, and that the copyright in the\n\nbook therefore granted Seemann rights in all the contents of the\n\nbook, including Hummel's illustrations.           Cambridge further alleges\n\nthat Goebel based the designs of at least some of the Hummel\n\nfigurines on particular images from the book, and not on Hummel\n\nartworks of independent provenance.            Those figurines, according to\n\nCambridge, represented works derivative of the book.                  Cambridge,\n\nassignee of Seemann's heirs and half-owner, along with Goebel, of\n\nthe book copyright, would thus be entitled to half of the proceeds\n\nof all exploitation of the book copyright in the United States.\n\nFrom these co-ownership rights, Cambridge argues, it is owed an\n\naccounting for Goebel's profits from the sale of at least some of\n\nits figurines and other uses of Hummel imagery in the United\n\nStates.     Goebel has disputed these contentions throughout this\n\nlitigation.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n          At no time has Cambridge alleged that Goebel exploited\nSeemann's written contributions to Das Hummel-Buch.\n\n                                      -11-\n\f             The district court initially dismissed Cambridge's suit\n\nfor   want    of   personal   jurisdiction.         This    court   reversed   and\n\nremanded.     Cambridge I, 295 F.3d at 66-68.         On remand, the district\n\ncourt again did not reach the merits of Cambridge's accounting or\n\nunjust enrichment claims.       Instead, it granted Goebel's motion for\n\nsummary judgment on the grounds that the Copyright Act's three-year\n\nstatute of limitations barred Cambridge's suit.               Cambridge II, 448\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 247; see also 17 U.S.C. § 507(b).\n\n                                      II.\n\n             We review de novo the entry of summary judgment in the\n\ndistrict court.        T-Peg, 459 F.3d at 111.             Summary judgment is\n\nproper here if the record, read favorably to Cambridge, reflects no\n\ngenuine      issues   of   material    fact   and     the     undisputed   facts\n\ndemonstrate that Goebel is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nT-Peg, 459 F.3d at 111; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n             Cambridge     contends   on   appeal    that    Massachusetts     law\n\ngoverns a claim for accounting for profits, and that consequently\n\nthe Copyright Act's statute of limitations does not apply.                     The\n\nissue is more complicated than that.          This framing of the argument\n\nassumes that the question of ownership had been resolved, by\n\nagreement or by a court judgment, before the state-law remedy of\n\naccounting was sought.        An action brought by a copyright co-owner\n\nseeking equitable remedies from another co-owner, even if those\n\nremedies are governed by state law, requires that the plaintiff\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\ffirst establish the existence of the right giving rise to the\n\nremedy.     See, e.g., MacDonald v. Page Co., 146 N.E. 727 (Mass.\n\n1925); 1A C.J.S. Accounting § 23 (2007).               In the case of an\n\naccounting for profits by a co-owner of a copyright where ownership\n\nis in dispute, that means the claimant must first establish it has\n\nownership as a predicate to an award of an accounting for profits.\n\nThe ownership question may be one of state law or of federal law,\n\ndepending on the facts of a case.         In cases involving rights such\n\nas those at issue here, plaintiffs usually raise this threshold\n\nissue by seeking a declaratory judgment for ownership.          See Santa-\n\nRosa, 471 F.3d at 225-26; Royal v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc., 833\n\nF.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987); see also, e.g., Gaiman v. McFarlane, 360\n\nF.3d 644, 648 (7th Cir. 2004); Merchant v. Levy, 92 F.3d 51, 53 (2d\n\nCir. 1996); Zuill v. Shanahan, 80 F.3d 1366, 1368 (9th Cir. 1996);\n\nGoodman v. Lee (Goodman II), 78 F.3d 1007, 1009 (5th Cir. 1996).\n\n            Cambridge's complaint does not request a declaration of\n\nits co-ownership of the United States copyright in Das Hummel-Buch.\n\nIt   both   asserts   ownership   and    acknowledges   that   Cambridge's\n\nownership is in controversy.        The omission does not remove the\n\npredicate    question   of   ownership    from   the   case,   and   whether\n\nCambridge has any ownership interest is in dispute, even on the\n\nface of the complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fA.             Applicability of the Copyright Act\n\n               Copyright cases may raise different issues, some of which\n\nare controlled by federal law and some of which may refer to and be\n\ncontrolled by state law.          We noted as much about this very case in\n\nCambridge I.      See 295 F.3d at 64 n.4 (recognizing that Cambridge's\n\nclaims might necessitate reference to \"federal copyright law and\n\nGerman contract law as to whether Hummel, Seemann, and Fink are co-\n\nowners;    Austrian        inheritance       law    if    the    Seemann      rights      are\n\ndisputed; federal copyright law as to whether the figurines are\n\nderivative works; and to the law of any of several jurisdictions as\n\nto the rights and defenses among co-owners\").\n\n               Here the necessary initial question -- ownership of\n\ncopyright interests -- is governed by the Copyright Act.                            Because\n\nthat   question       is   governed     by    the   Act,    the      Act's    statute      of\n\nlimitations applies as well.                 See 17 U.S.C. § 507(b) (\"No civil\n\naction shall be maintained under the provisions of this title\n\nunless    it    is    commenced    within       three      years      after    the    claim\n\naccrued.\").          It would be anomalous and, we think, contrary to\n\ncongressional         language    and    intent      not        to   apply    the     Act's\n\nlimitations period when the Act governs the question of ownership\n\ninterest.\n\n               Our view that a single copyright case can raise different\n\nissues    governed      by   different       laws    is   well       accepted.       In    an\n\ninstructive if not directly parallel case, the Supreme Court\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\faddressed the applicability of federal and state law in actions\n\nasserting copyright interests. In De Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U.S.\n\n570 (1956), the mother of the illegitimate child of a deceased\n\ncomposer sued for a declaratory judgment that the child possessed\n\nan interest in the renewal copyrights of the composer's works; the\n\nmother also sought an accounting for past profits.   Id. at 571-72.\n\nThe ownership determination hinged on a provision in the Copyright\n\nAct, then in effect, which was ambiguous on two issues:      whether\n\nchildren of authors could inherit copyright renewal rights during\n\nthe lifetime of the author's widow; and whether \"children,\" as used\n\nwithin the Copyright Act, included illegitimate offspring.    Id. at\n\n572.\n\n           The Court held that \"[t]he scope of a federal right is,\n\nof course, a federal question,\" and interpreted the ambiguous\n\nCopyright Act provision to resolve the ownership issue.      Id. at\n\n580.   The Court did reference state law in the course of construing\n\nthe Act.   As to the discrete issue of whether the term \"children\"\n\nincluded illegitimate offspring, the Court noted that \"there is no\n\nfederal law of domestic relations, which is primarily a matter of\n\nstate concern.\"   Id.   Because the federal Act did not address the\n\nissue at hand, which was \"really a question of the descent of\n\nproperty,\" the Court looked to the California Probate Code, the\n\nsource of law that would govern descent of the composer's estate,\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fto give content to the term \"children\" as used in the Copyright\n\nAct.   Id. at 581-82.\n\n              The current Copyright Act treats determinations of the\n\nrights at issue here as questions of authorship status and initial\n\nownership of copyrights.      Section 101 of the current Act expressly\n\ndefines terms such as \"copyright owner,\" \"joint work,\" and \"work\n\nmade for hire.\"         17 U.S.C. § 101.            Section 201 of the Act\n\nexplicitly controls vesting of copyright in authors; sets out the\n\nownership status of authors and co-authors of joint works; and\n\nestablishes copyright ownership by employers who commission works\n\nmade for hire.      17 U.S.C. § 201.        There is a substantial federal\n\ninterest in having the federal statute of limitations applied to\n\nthese determinations.\n\n              Indeed, the Act also contains a provision that expressly\n\npreempts state common-law copyright protection and all other \"legal\n\nor equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive\n\nrights within the general scope of copyright . . . .\"               17 U.S.C.\n\n§   301(a).      That   provision,   while     by   its   terms   governs   the\n\npreemption of causes of action, presupposes the existence of \"legal\n\nor equitable rights\" which are, in turn, defined elsewhere in the\n\nAct.\n\n              Our concern is thus not, as Cambridge suggests, with\n\nwhether the Act preempts a state accounting cause of action.                That\n\nis a hypothetical question on the facts of this case, and we do not\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fgive advisory opinions.    Our concern is only with whether the\n\nfederal statute of limitations applies to the prerequisite issues\n\nof ownership which are governed by the Act.\n\n          All of the federal circuit courts of appeal that have\n\naddressed the issue, including this one, agree that a determination\n\nof copyright ownership based on a disputed allegation of co-\n\nauthorship presents a federal question that arises under, and must\n\nbe determined according to, the Copyright Act. See Santa-Rosa, 471\n\nF.3d at 227; see also, e.g., Gaiman, 360 F.3d at 652-53; Merchant,\n\n92 F.3d at 55-56; Goodman II, 78 F.3d at 1010.6   Where an ownership\n\nclaim arises under the Copyright Act, the Act's three-year statute\n\nof limitations likewise applies. Gaiman, 360 F.3d at 653; see also\n\nSanta-Rosa, 471 F.3d at 227; Merchant, 92 F.3d at 56.    Some cases\n\naddress the question in the context of performing an \"arising\n\nunder\" analysis to determine whether there is federal jurisdiction.\n\nSee, e.g., Merchant, 92 F.3d at 55; see also Royal, 833 F.2d at 2-3\n\n(adopting test for original federal subject matter jurisdiction in\n\nT. B. Harms v. Eliscu, 339 F.2d 823 (2d Cir. 1964)).    Here, there\n\n\n     6\n          Nothing in our decision in Royal is inconsistent,\ncontrary to Cambridge's argument. In Royal, we upheld dismissal of\na claim for declaration of copyright ownership because that claim\ndid not create federal question jurisdiction.      833 F.2d at 2.\nHere, jurisdiction is not at issue.        In addition, the Royal\nclaimant's theory of ownership turned not on his status as a co-\nauthor, but on an alleged breach of a royalty agreement between the\nclaimant and his employer. Id. at 1-3. Because \"[the claimant's]\nassertions gr[e]w out of his purported contract rights,\" state law\ncontrolled their resolution and failed to create federal subject\nmatter jurisdiction. Id. at 3.\n\n                               -17-\n\fis diversity jurisdiction, but the question of whether there is a\n\nfederal question under the Copyright Act as to the prerequisite of\n\nco-ownership involves parallel reasoning.\n\n          Cambridge attempts to avoid this conclusion by arguing\n\nthat \"the Act's limitations do not apply to actions for accounting\n\nbetween co-owners.\"    As we have said, that is not the issue.\n\nCambridge argues that it is the fact that the action is one which\n\nthe complaint labels as being for an accounting that makes the\n\ndifference.7   If co-ownership were conceded and the only question\n\nwas a claim for accounting of profits from the other joint owner,\n\nthen Cambridge could argue the suit was only for an accounting of\n\nprofits under state law.   Gaiman, 360 F.3d at 652.     But under a\n\nlong line of federal cases, Cambridge must first establish that it\n\nis a co-owner, and the answer to that lies in the application of\n\nthe Copyright Act and subjects that claim to the Act's statute of\n\nlimitations.   See id. at 652-53.     Cambridge cannot avoid this by\n\nthe stratagem of failing to ask for a declaration of ownership as\n\n\n     7\n          Our holding is that the federal period of limitations,\nand not a state limitations period, applies to the predicate\nquestion of co-authorship rights,       which is governed by the\nCopyright Act. We see no need to address the defense of preemption\nraised by Goebel, see 17 U.S.C. § 301, or Cambridge's argument that\nthere is no preemption. In particular, Cambridge argues that a\ngrandfathering provision saves the accounting claim from preemption\nbecause it involves \"undertakings commenced before January 1,\n1978,\" i.e., Goebel's exploitation of Hummel imagery from 1935 to\nthe present. Id. § 301(b)(2). Our holding rests on the fact that\nthe issue of ownership must be addressed first and is controlled by\nthe Copyright Act's limitations period. This is true whether or\nnot the claim for an accounting under state law is preempted.\n\n                               -18-\n\fa   method   of   avoiding   the   federal    limitations   period   for    an\n\nownership claim governed by the federal Act.8\n\n             Cambridge cites Goodman II, 78 F.3d 1007, as support for\n\nits argument.     That case does not support Cambridge's position; it\n\ndoes support our view of the case.         In Goodman, a musician sued the\n\nheirs of her former performing partner for a declaration of co-\n\nauthorship and an accounting for royalties from the song \"Let the\n\nGood Times Roll.\"     Goodman v. Lee (Goodman I), 815 F.2d 1030, 1031\n\n(5th Cir. 1987). The district court granted defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. The\n\nFifth Circuit reversed \"[b]ecause . . . exclusive federal district\n\ncourt jurisdiction exists in an action for a declaratory judgment\n\nto establish joint authorship of a copyrighted work . . . .\"               Id.\n\nat 1032.\n\n             After trial, the Goodman jury found that the plaintiff\n\n\"was a co-author of [the song]\" and that her claim was timely\n\nbecause \"she 'did not know or should not have known'\" until the\n\nyear before filing suit that her co-author had listed himself as\n\nthe sole author on the copyright registration. Goodman II, 78 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n      8\n          If Cambridge is arguing that the grandfathering clause in\nsection 301(b)(2) somehow makes the co-authorship issue not an\nissue of federal law under the Act, then Cambridge is wrong. By\nits own terms, section 301(b) is limited in its application only to\n\"rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any State.\"\nId. § 301(b). Pre-1978 claims of co-author status are governed by\nthe Copyright Act of 1909. Cf. De Sylva, 351 U.S. at 580.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fat 1010.    Only after the co-authorship issue was resolved did the\n\ncourt address the issue of an accounting.\n\n            On   appeal    in   Goodman,    the   defendants      contested   the\n\ndistrict court's remedial award of an accounting.                       The Fifth\n\nCircuit held that the remedy of an accounting did not itself\n\npresent    any   federal   questions,      unlike    the     resolved   predicate\n\nquestion of ownership, and that Louisiana law, including the state\n\nstatute of limitations, governed the accounting issues.                    Id. at\n\n1012-13.\n\n            The Goodman decisions are entirely consistent with the\n\nprevailing view that disputed claims about whether there is co-\n\nauthorship require application of the Copyright Act and the Act's\n\nstatute of limitations.         The portion of the opinion that applied\n\nstate law is inapposite here, because it dealt with accounting\n\nissues    that   only   arose    following    a     proper    determination    of\n\ncopyright ownership under the Copyright Act.                  Cambridge has not\n\ncleared that hurdle of establishing ownership.9\n\n            The controversy over Cambridge's copyright interests\n\ndirectly involves Seemann's authorship status and her initial\n\nownership of the copyright in Das Hummel-Buch, as well as the\n\neffect of various registration documents and transfers.                       The\n\n\n\n     9\n          The question of whether a claim for an accounting for\nprofits realized from exploitation of a jointly-owned copyright --\nonce that ownership is established -- is subject to state-law\nlimitations is not one that we need decide. See supra note 7.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fCopyright Act clearly covers these issues.     See 17 U.S.C. §§ 101,\n\n201, 204-05, 410.    We hold as a matter of law that on the facts of\n\nthis case, Cambridge's allegations of co-ownership present an issue\n\nsubject to the Copyright Act and that the Act's three-year statute\n\nof limitations applies to that issue, which must be resolved before\n\nthe issue of an accounting arises.\n\nB.        Application of the Act's Accrual Rules to These Claims\n\n          The Copyright Act bars lawsuits premised on a copyright\n\nclaim brought after three years from accrual of that claim.       17\n\nU.S.C. § 507(b).     A claim accrues when a plaintiff \"knows or has\n\nreason to know of the act which is the basis for the claim.\"\n\nSanta-Rosa, 471 F.3d at 227 (internal quotation omitted).         If\n\nCambridge's claims accrued earlier than February 24, 1997, three\n\nyears before Cambridge filed the present suit, the suit is barred.\n\n          In Santa-Rosa, we applied the accrual test to a 2004 suit\n\nby a renowned salsa musician requesting a declaration of co-\n\nownership in several recordings he allegedly co-authored in the\n\nmid-1980s.   471 F.3d at 225-26.   We affirmed dismissal of the suit\n\nas time-barred.     Id. at 228.\n\n          Santa-Rosa held that the plaintiff knew or should have\n\nknown of the basis for his claim to co-authorship of the songs at\n\nthe moment of their creation.       Id.   After all, \"'[a] co-author\n\nknows that he or she jointly created a work from the moment of its\n\ncreation,'\" and thus would have been aware at that time of a claim\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\ffor co-ownership.    Id. (quoting Merchant, 92 F.3d at 56); cf. 17\n\nU.S.C. § 101 (defining \"joint work\" as \"a work prepared by two or\n\nmore authors with the intention that their contributions be merged\n\ninto inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole\"\n\n(emphasis added)).   \"Thus,\" Santa-Rosa reasoned, \"there is little\n\nquestion that [plaintiff's] claims for co-ownership accrued as soon\n\nas he finished recording each album.\"     471 F.3d at 228.   In Santa-\n\nRosa the claimant was the co-author, and not an heir.\n\n           Santa-Rosa acknowledged, however, that other courts have\n\napplied the accrual test differently.        For instance, the Ninth\n\nCircuit has held that a claim for a declaration of ownership under\n\nthe Copyright Act does not accrue until \"a 'plain and express\n\nrepudiation of co-ownership is communicated to the claimant.'\" Id.\n\n(quoting Zuill, 80 F.3d at 1369).      Even under this more claimant-\n\nfriendly standard, however, the Santa-Rosa plaintiff could not\n\nprevail, because there was plain and express repudiation of co-\n\nownership from the fact that the defendant record company \"openly,\n\nand quite notoriously, sold [plaintiff's] records without providing\n\npayment to him\" more than three years before the plaintiff filed\n\nsuit.   Id.\n\n           Under the reasoning of Santa-Rosa, the accrual inquiry in\n\nthis case would initially be directed at Margarete Seemann and her\n\nknowledge of potential ownership claims in the 1930s.          If, as\n\nCambridge claims, Seemann had co-authored Das Hummel-Buch as a\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fjoint work, she would by definition have been aware of her status\n\nas joint owner of the book and all of its contents.                 Seemann also\n\nconceivably received notice of a repudiation of her ownership\n\nstatus when Goebel began marketing Hummel figurines in the 1930s\n\nand failed to pay Seemann any royalties.              Under a literal reading\n\nof Santa-Rosa, Seemann's claims for a declaration of co-authorship\n\nof the book would have accrued long before her death in 1949.\n\n              The Santa-Rosa model for accrual does not work well here\n\nbecause the Copyright Act did not contain a statute of limitations\n\nfor civil actions until 1957.           See 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer\n\non Copyright § 12.05[A] (2007).           We also do not reach the question\n\nof whether the claims based on Seemann's work accrued within three\n\nyears after a statute of limitations was added to the Copyright\n\nAct.    Instead, we ask whether any claims held by Cambridge and/or\n\nthe assignors of the rights Cambridge alleges descended from\n\nSeemann accrued before the case was brought.\n\n              1.          The Romanowicz Assignment\n\n              Maria Romanowicz, Seemann's heir in Vienna, assigned\n\nwhatever rights she may have had in the book's United States\n\ncopyright to Cambridge by September 6, 1995.                 We do not address\n\nwhether Romanowicz's rights were time-barred at that time.\n\n              Cambridge     did   not   file   suit   within   three   years      of\n\nacquisition of those rights, and based on its knowledge at the\n\ntime,   the    claim   is    barred.      Cambridge    was     on   notice   of   a\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\frepudiation         of    those    rights     by     the    time    of    the    assignment.\n\nHerrmann, Cambridge's sole shareholder and negotiating adversary to\n\nRomanowicz, was privy to the Schmid-Goebel settlement agreement\n\nstipulating that those two companies owned all rights to the book\n\nin the United States.              Moreover, Herrmann knew that Romanowicz was\n\nnot    receiving         royalties     from     Goebel      on     the    sale    of   Hummel\n\nfigurines.\n\n               The most cogent evidence of accrual is Cambridge's own\n\nmotivation for approaching Romanowicz.                      What Cambridge sought to\n\npurchase      was    essentially          a   cause    of    action       against      Goebel.\n\nCambridge was aware of whatever potential claims against Goebel the\n\npurchase would bolster, and even ensured that the assignment\n\ncontract specified a transfer of any and all claims for accountings\n\nunder       United       States    law.       With     respect       to   the    Romanowicz\n\nassignment, the statute of limitations under the Copyright Act\n\nstarted running against Cambridge no later than September 1995.\n\nBecause there was no tolling (as we explain below), section 507(b)\n\nof    the    Copyright       Act    barred    Cambridge's          claims   based      on   the\n\nRomanowicz assignment before this suit was filed in 2000.\n\n               2.             The Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic Assignment\n\n               On the undisputed facts, Dr. Alexandrine Cermanovic-\n\nKuzmanovic, Margarete Seemann's heir in Belgrade, knew -- or\n\nreasonably should have known -- about the basis for a claim of co-\n\nownership of the United States copyright to Das Hummel-Buch before\n\n\n                                              -24-\n\fFebruary 1997.     In making this determination, we do not decide\n\nwhether Seemann co-authored the book, whether Goebel's figurines\n\nwere derivatives of the book, or whether any rights that descended\n\nfrom Seemann to the heirs entitled the heirs to share in profits\n\nderived from sales of the figurines.       The accrual test looks to the\n\nexistence of a claim, not its resolution.\n\n           Herrmann first contacted Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic's attorney\n\nin Vienna, Dr. Theodor Petter, in 1995.           Petter referred Herrmann\n\ndirectly to Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic to discuss an assignment of\n\ncopyrights.     Herrmann testified that in a conversation that same\n\nyear, Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic indicated that \"she was very interested\n\nin gaining some income based upon an assignment of her American\n\nrights . . . .\"    She referred Herrmann back to Petter, and the two\n\nattorneys commenced negotiations.10         At that time, Cermanovic-\n\nKuzmanovic knew she was not receiving any payments on any inherited\n\nco-author ownership right in Das Hummel-Buch.             She also was aware\n\nthat Fink had not paid her royalties on the original German book,\n\nin   contrast   with   Fink's   payment   until    1973   to   the   heirs   of\n\nroyalties on an English-language The Hummel Book.11\n\n\n      10\n          Petter died soon thereafter. In 1996, Petter's daughter,\nDr. Elizabeth Fetcher-Petter, took over her father's law practice\nand resumed negotiations with Herrmann. Fetcher-Petter described\nthose negotiations as \"productive but extremely lengthy\"; the\nassignment from Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic to Cambridge was finally\nexecuted on February 9, 1999.\n      11\n          A stipulation between the parties indicates that Fink\npaid book royalties to the heirs until 1973. Cambridge argues that\n\n                                   -25-\n\f          Starting at the latest in 1995, when she was contacted by\n\nHerrmann, Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic had every motivation to ascertain\n\nthe existence and potential value of her rights in the book, and\n\nshe had counsel in Vienna to assist her in that task.   Yet she did\n\nnot bring suit within three years, even though readily available\n\ninquiries would have revealed numerous repudiations of the \"rights\"\n\nCambridge sought to purchase.\n\n          There were a number of different signs of repudiation,\n\nwhich in total require the conclusion that the claims had accrued.\n\nPublicly available documents in the United States Copyright Office\n\nraised issues about Seemann's purported ownership of Das Hummel-\n\nBuch.   First, the original 1936 application for a United States\n\ncopyright in the book lists the publishing house Emil Fink Verlag\n\nas the \"copyright owner.\"   Second, the 1962 application for the\n\nrenewal copyright lists the publisher as \"proprietor of copyright\n\n\n\n\"[t]hese payments constituted an affirmation of [Cermanovic-\nKuzmanovic's] interests [in the book] both by Fink and [Goebel] .\n. . .\" Cambridge's argument fails. The stipulation states that\nFink paid royalties to Seemann and her heirs for sales of The\nHummel Book, the English translation of Das Hummel-Buch. The 1934\ncontract between Fink and Seemann treated these as two separate\nproperties. Fink was to pay Seemann three lump sums in 1934 for\nthe use of her poems in Das Hummel-Buch. Fink could, according to\nthe contract, prepare translations of the German book only by\nmutual agreement with Seemann, and the poet would receive a 4%\nroyalty on the retail price of any translated books.          As a\ntranslation, The Hummel Book itself is a derivative work, the\nownership of which \"does not imply any exclusive right in the\npreexisting material.\" 17 U.S.C. §§ 101, 103. Any rights in a\ntranslation of Das Hummel-Buch would therefore not extend to any of\nthe images contained in the original German edition.\n\n                                -26-\n\fin a work made for hire.\"       Third, a 1971 transfer document,\n\nrecorded in accordance with 17 U.S.C. § 205, expressly names Fink\n\nas owner of the copyright and describes an assignment of the\n\ncopyright to Goebel. Fourth, due diligence, including questions to\n\nCambridge, may well have led to information about the litigation\n\nwhich resulted in the 1992 Consent Decree.    There is another point\n\nas well.   Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic openly expressed to Herrmann when\n\nhe telephoned her in 1995 that she was interested in obtaining\n\nincome from whatever rights she might hold.\n\n           Beyond that, if Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic indeed possessed a\n\njoint interest in the book's United States copyright as an heir to\n\nSeemann, then she would have been entitled to the exclusive right\n\n\"to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.\"   17\n\nU.S.C. § 106(2).    Goebel, meanwhile, had been \"openly[] and quite\n\nnotoriously\" exploiting works for decades that appeared in Das\n\nHummel-Buch.12     Santa-Rosa, 471 F.3d at 228.    At least one of\n\nGoebel's much-used and apparently profitable images appears in Das\n\nHummel-Buch. Cambridge's complaint points out that Goebel has \"for\n\ndecades utilized, in a particular and crucial fashion, one specific\n\npicture . . . popularly known as 'The Merry Wanderer,'\" which\n\n\n\n\n     12\n          Goebel does not argue that the mere manufacturing and\nmarketing of Hummel figurines put the heirs on notice, regardless\nof the heirs' knowledge of the source for the figurines.\n\n                                -27-\n\f\"'ultimately became the symbol for the entire M. I. Hummel line.'\"\n\nYet Goebel never paid the heirs for its use of The Merry Wanderer.13\n\n          The sum, by 1995, of all of this was to start the\n\nlimitations period running.   Publicly available documents in the\n\nCopyright Office and prior litigation cast doubt on Cermanovic-\n\nKuzmanovic's rights in Das Hummel-Buch.   Moreover, Goebel engaged\n\nin widespread exploitation of at least some portion of those\n\nrights, such as its use of The Merry Wanderer, without remuneration\n\nto Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic.   Such circumstances constituted a \"plain\n\nand express repudiation\" of Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic's purported co-\n\nownership rights in Das Hummel-Buch sufficient to trigger the\n\nCopyright Act's three-year statute of limitations. Santa-Rosa, 471\n\nF.3d at 228 (internal quotation omitted).\n\n          Whether Seemann co-authored Das Hummel-Buch or not, the\n\nright to contest that status lay with the poet's heirs until they\n\nassigned them to Cambridge.    Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic did not file\n\nsuit by 1998. Cambridge did not resurrect that claim by purchasing\n\nan assignment from Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic in 1999.    \"[A]n assignee\n\ncannot maintain a claim in the face of a limitations defense that\n\n\n     13\n          Cambridge argues that the apparent repudiation of any\nrights held by Seemann in The Merry Wanderer and other images from\nDas Hummel-Buch was insufficient because Seemann's heirs could not\npossibly have known for certain that Goebel was exploiting\nderivatives of the book. Cambridge maintains this is so because\nGoebel, if asked, would have denied that it was exploiting\nderivative works. The heirs, as with any other rights-holder with\na potential claim, need not have obtained an admission of liability\nfrom Goebel in order for accrual to occur.\n\n                               -28-\n\fwould have trumped the same claim had it been brought by the\n\nassignor.\"     Young, 305 F.3d at 17.\n\n            3.          Tolling\n\n            Cambridge argues that a \"legal disability\" tolled the\n\nstatute of limitations against its claims based on the assignment\n\nfrom Romanowicz in 1995.      Cambridge could not have filed this case\n\nuntil 1999, it claims, because \"until then the sole basis for\n\nalleging Goebel's exploitation was documents classified as 'SECRET'\n\nby a federal court in another earlier matter -- the content of\n\nwhich [Herrmann] was duty bound not to disclose.\"\n\n            Cambridge's position, even taken on its own terms, is\n\nbaseless.    Just as all the reasons we have outlined would have put\n\nCermanovic-Kuzmanovic on notice of a repudiation of Seemann's\n\nstatus as co-author, those reasons provided more than adequate\n\ngrounds for Cambridge to allege that Goebel had prepared works\n\nderivative of the book.       Cambridge need not have relied on any\n\ndocuments under protective order to file this lawsuit.           There was\n\nno   tolling     of   Cambridge's   claims   based   on   the   Romanowicz\n\nassignment.\n\n            We affirm summary judgment in favor of defendants. Costs\n\nare awarded to defendants.\n\n\n\n                       -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\f           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.             The majority\n\nopinion holds that since the Cambridge state-law accounting claim\n\nmight require it to establish as a threshold matter that its\n\npredecessor-in-interest, Margarete Seemann, was an original co-\n\nowner of the copyright in Das Hummelbuch, the Cambridge claim thus\n\n“arises under” the Copyright Act for purposes of both subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction and, by logical extension, the Act’s three-year\n\nstatute of limitations.        Inasmuch as the ramifications of this\n\nholding – viz., that the federal courts have exclusive subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction to adjudicate all accounting claims between the\n\nco-owners of a copyrighted work, see 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a) – are both\n\nunprecedented and potentially pernicious, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                    I\n\n           The majority relies principally on decisions such as De\n\nSylva v. Ballentine, 351 U.S. 570 (1956), for the proposition that\n\nany   state-law   cause   of   action   which   potentially    involves   a\n\nthreshold determination of the plaintiff’s copyright ownership must\n\nbe said to “arise under” the Copyright Act (viz., a de facto\n\nfederal cause of action), and thus is governed by the Act and\n\nsubject to its three-year statute of limitations, thereby rendering\n\nany discrete inquiry into the scope of the Act’s preemptive effect\n\nimmaterial.   However, De Sylva was a non-diversity case in which\n\nthe plaintiff expressly filed a claim pursuant to the Copyright\n\nAct, demanding a declaratory judgment that she was a co-owner of a\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fcopyrighted work, and consequently the Court assumed that the\n\nCopyright       Act’s       substantive    definitions      concerning    copyright\n\nownership governed any decision on the merits of the plaintiff’s\n\nfederal-law claim.           See id. at 975.14      To establish subject matter\n\njurisdiction,         a    declaratory     judgment      plaintiff   normally     must\n\ndemonstrate more than its desire to settle its rights under federal\n\nlaw, but must show “a real and reasonable apprehension” that the\n\ndefendant plans to sue to establish that the plaintiff is not so\n\nentitled, viz., that Goebel planned to litigate a dispute as to\n\nwhether the Cambridge chain of title originated with a person who\n\nwas a “co-owner” of the copyright as defined by the Copyright Act\n\nof 1909.    See generally, 3-12 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer,\n\nNimmer on Copyright § 12.01 (2005) (noting that “the [federal]\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act [28 U.S.C. § 2201(a)] does not, of its own\n\nforce, confer subject matter jurisdiction on the federal courts”;\n\n“[o]nce    an    action       for   declaratory    relief     is    instituted,    the\n\ndefendant       can       attempt   to    negate   the    element    of   reasonable\n\napprehension of litigation by entering a binding covenant not to\n\nsue.”).    When the plaintiff himself pleads a claim for declaratory\n\n\n\n     14\n          The Cambridge complaint sufficiently invoked the district\ncourt’s diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1332, and thus does\nnot depend on the existence vel non of federal-question\njurisdiction. The jurisdictional analysis is relevant only to the\nquestion whether the claim is “maintained” under the Copyright Act,\nsee infra note 21, and thus subject to its three-year statute of\nlimitations, rather than the applicable state-law limitations\nperiod.\n\n                                           -31-\n\fjudgment, the ownership of the Copyright Act title is not merely a\n\npotential focus of dispute, it is the only issue relevant to an\n\nadjudication of the declaratory action.15\n\n               In stark contrast, Cambridge filed no federal-law claim\n\nfor a declaration of copyright ownership under the Copyright Act,\n\nbut merely a claim in equity for an accounting between tenants in\n\ncommon of property, which is premised entirely on state-created\n\ncommon law. See, e.g., Arsenault v. Arsenault, 148 N.E.2d 662, 663\n\n(Mass. 1958); see also Nimmer on Copyright § 6.12 (noting that a\n\njoint owner of a copyrighted work is under an equitable duty to\n\naccount to other joint owners for a rateable share of the profits\n\nrealized from his use of the work).          For jurisdictional purposes,\n\nthe plaintiff normally is the “master” of his complaint, and if he\n\npleads a claim purely based in state law, the claim cannot be\n\ndeemed    to    have   “arise[n]   under”   federal   law,   even   if   it   is\n\nanticipated that the defendant’s answer will deny the plaintiff’s\n\nfactual allegations or will raise federal-law defenses to that\n\nstate-law claim. See Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation\n\nSys., Inc., 535 U.S. 826, 831 (2002) (“[S]ince the plaintiff is\n\n\n     15\n          All the other cases cited by the majority are cut from\nthis same cloth, and involve a straightforward holding that a claim\nwhich the plaintiff expressly denominates as a federal-law claim\nobviously must be said to “arise under” the federal statute that it\ninvokes.

Such a claim might\n\nbe considered to “arise under” federal law for jurisdictional\n\npurposes if: (i) an adjudication of the state-law claim necessarily\n\nwill involve the determination of a “substantial federal question,”\n\nsee Almond v. Capital Props., Inc., 212 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); or (ii) a federal statute (e.g., the Copyright Act) can be\n\nsaid to exert such a pervasive and overpowering preemptive force\n\nthat all state-law claims of the type pleaded are “completely\n\npreempted,” see Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation\n\nTrust, 463 U.S. 1, 22, 24 (1983) (noting that plaintiff cannot, by\n\n“artful pleading,” escape complete preemption); SPGGC, LLC v.\n\nAyotte, 488 F.3d 525, 530 n.4 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting that complete\n\npreemption “converts the state claim into a federal claim”). In my\n\nview, the Cambridge accounting claim satisfies neither exception.\n\nA.   “Substantial Federal Question” (\"SFQ\") Jurisdiction\n\n          Goebel   suggests    that,      even    though   the   Cambridge\n\naccounting claim makes no mention of the Copyright Act, it “arises\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\funder” the Act in that Cambridge obviously would not be entitled to\n\na state-law accounting if it were not a co-owner of the Das\n\nHummelbuch copyright, a status which in turn depends, inter alia,\n\non Cambridge establishing that Margarete Seemann originally fit the\n\nco-ownership definitions of the Act.   See 17 U.S.C. § 101 (noting\n\nthat “joint work” is “a work prepared by two or more authors with\n\nthe intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable\n\nor interdependent parts of a unitary whole”); id. § 201(a) (“The\n\nauthors of a joint work are co-owners of copyright in the work.”).16\n\n\n     16\n          Oddly enough, given the fact that the case has proceeded\nto the summary judgment stage, Goebel has yet to file an answer to\nthe Cambridge complaint, see Wolf v. Reliance Standard Life Ins.\nCo., 71 F.3d 444, 449 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that affirmative\ndefenses normally are waived if not filed in initial responsive\npleadings), has yet to deny the Cambridge allegation that Cambridge\nis a valid copyright co-owner (via descent and contract) of\nSeemann’s original title, and has not produced a Rule 56\nevidentiary proffer which would call the Seemann joint ownership\ninto doubt. See H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, 120, 121 (1976), reprinted\nin 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5736 (noting that co-ownership inquiry\nmust focus on “the intention at the time the writing is done that\nthe parts be absorbed or combined into an integrated unit”);\nThomson v. Larson, 147 F.3d 195, 199 (2d Cir. 1998).        Rather,\nGoebel simply maintains on appeal that the mere possibility of such\na factual dispute satisfies the SFQ exception to the well-pleaded\ncomplaint. Goebel would face three considerable hurdles, however,\nif it were to pursue such a denial: (i) Das Hummelbuch, on its\nface, appears to be a unitary and fully integrated creation of\nartwork and poetry, viz., a “joint work” as defined by § 101 and §\n201(a), see Lulirama Ltd., Inc. v. Axcess Broad. Servs., Inc., 128\nF.3d 872, 877 (5th Cir. 1997) (noting that the contribution of an\nindependent contractor will not be deemed a “work for hire” unless\nit fits into “one of the nine narrowly drawn categories of works”);\n(ii) Seemann’s listing as an author on the certificate of\nregistration creates a rebuttable presumption of her joint\nauthorship and ownership, see Brown v. Latin Am. Music Co., 498\nF.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 410(c) (“In any\njudicial proceedings the certificate of a registration made before\n\n                               -35-\n\f            Admittedly, “[d]etermining precisely which [state-law]\n\nactions ‘arise under’ copyright law, and therefore fall within\n\nexclusive     federal     jurisdiction,        ‘poses    among    the    knottiest\n\nprocedural problems in copyright jurisprudence.’” Gener-Villar v.\n\nAd-Com Group, Inc., 417 F.3d 201, 203 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting\n\nNimmer on Copyright § 12.01[A]).           Nonetheless, since the “federal\n\ncourts are courts of limited jurisdiction, . . . [they] must\n\n‘monitor    their   jurisdictional       boundaries      vigilantly.’”      Diaz-\n\nRodriguez v. Pep Boys Corp., 410 F.3d 56, 62 n.5 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(emphasis    added;     citation    omitted).      The    “controversial”     SFQ\n\nexception thus “endures in principle but should be applied with\n\ncaution     and   various     qualifications.”           Rossello-Gonzalez     v.\n\nCalderon-Serra,     398     F.3d   1,   11-12    (1st    Cir.    2004)   (“Federal\n\ningredient jurisdiction remains ‘controversial,’ because ‘[t]he\n\nSupreme Court has periodically affirmed this basis for jurisdiction\n\nin the abstract . . . , occasionally cast doubt upon it, rarely\n\napplied it in practice, and left the very scope of the concept\n\n\n\n\nor within five years after first publication of the work shall\nconstitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright\nand of the facts stated in the certificate.”)); and (iii) any\nrebuttal of this presumption would depend on Goebel’s proof of the\ncontrary intention of persons long since deceased, see, e.g.,\nStuart & Sons, L.P. v. Curtis Publ’g. Co., 456 F. Supp. 2d 336, 348\n(D. Conn. 2006).\n\n                                        -36-\n\funclear.’”)(quoting Almond, 212 F.3d at 23); see Metheny v. Becker,\n\n352 F.3d 458, 460 (1st Cir. 2003).17\n\n             Such special caution is necessary in the instant case\n\nbecause if the SFQ exception were found to have been satisfied\n\nmerely    because     the    Goebel   answer   might   deny   and   dispute   the\n\nplaintiff’s copyright co-ownership as a “defense” to the Cambridge\n\nstate-law accounting claim, see supra note 16, then all state-law\n\naccounting claims between copyright co-owners must “arise under”\n\nthe Copyright Act, even where there is no genuine factual dispute\n\nunder 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 and 201(a) regarding the provenance of the\n\nplaintiff’s title.          In the vast majority of accounting cases, the\n\nparties are likely to stipulate the plaintiff’s co-ownership under\n\nthese     Copyright    Act    definitions,     hence   state-law    issues    will\n\npredominate the adjudication of the accounting claim.                 Since the\n\nfederal courts have exclusive jurisdiction to decide Copyright Act\n\ncases, however, see 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a), all such claims would be\n\nremovable as of right from state to federal court, thus effecting\n\na significant expansion of our “federal question” jurisdiction.18\n\n\n     17\n          Although most cases discussing the SFQ jurisdictional\nexception have involved general federal question jurisdiction, 28\nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441, the exception is equally available to\nestablish “copyright” jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a). See\nChristianson v. Colt Indus.

Darue Eng’g &\n\nMfg., 545 U.S. 308, 312-14 (2005), the Supreme Court recently\n\nelaborated on the inherent limitations of the SFQ exception to the\n\nwell-pleaded complaint rule, which it originally pronounced more\n\nbroadly in Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180\n\n(1921).19     “[T]he mere need to apply federal law in a state-law\n\nclaim will [not] suffice to open the ‘arising under’ door. . . .\n\n[T]his Court [has] confined [it] to those [state-law claims] that\n\n‘really     and   substantially   involv[e]   a   dispute   or   controversy\n\nrespecting the validity, construction or effect of [federal] law.’”\n\nGrable, 545 U.S. at 313 (noting that the SFQ exception “demands not\n\nonly a contested federal issue, but a substantial one, indicating\n\na serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be\n\n\npreempted by the Copyright Act (viz., those which include an “extra\nelement” beyond mere infringement) nonetheless would be deemed to\n“arise under” federal law. See infra Section II.C.\n     19\n          In Smith, plaintiff sought to enjoin corporate directors\nfrom investing in a federally chartered land bank, pursuant to a\nstate law which prohibited directors from investing in any\ngovernment bonds that were issued in violation of the law.   Smith,\n255 U.S. at 195-96.      Plaintiff’s complaint alleged that the\ndirectors had breached their fiduciary duty to the shareholders\nbecause the federal law which authorized the directors of a federal\nland bank to issue bonds was unconstitutional and invalid. Id. at\n197-98. The Court found SFQ jurisdiction because the plaintiff\ncould only prevail on his statutory claim for breach of fiduciary\nduty by proving his federal constitutional claim. Id. at 201.\n\n                                    -38-\n\finherent in a federal forum”) (emphasis added; citation omitted);\n\nsee Merrell Dow Pharm. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 813 (1986)\n\n(“[T]he mere presence of a federal issue in a state cause of action\n\ndoes not automatically confer federal-question jurisdiction.”);\n\nDunlap v. G&L Holding Group, Inc., 381 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.\n\n2004).     In other words, “the question is, does a state-law claim\n\nnecessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and\n\nsubstantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing\n\nany congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial\n\nresponsibilities.”        Grable, 545 U.S. at 314 (emphasis added).                 The\n\nCourt admonished that the federal courts should invoke the SFQ\n\nexception only if it is “consistent with congressional judgment\n\nabout    the    sound   division      of   labor    between     state    and    federal\n\ncourts.”        Id. at 313-14.        Further, “the presence of a disputed\n\nfederal issue and the ostensible importance of a federal forum are\n\nnever necessarily dispositive; there must always be an assessment\n\nof any disruptive portent in exercising federal jurisdiction.” Id.\n\nat 314.\n\n               The   Grable   Court    found      the    SFQ   exception       satisfied\n\nbecause the plaintiff’s state-law complaint, which sought to quiet\n\ntitle to property which the Internal Revenue Service seized and\n\nsold at auction to a third party, depended entirely on a dispute\n\nabout     the    adequacy     of   the      IRS’s       compliance      with    seizure\n\nnotification procedures set forth in the federal tax code, see 26\n\n\n                                           -39-\n\fU.S.C. § 6335.   Grable, 545 U.S. at 315 (“Whether Grable was given\n\n[adequate] notice within the meaning of the federal statute is thus\n\nan essential element of its quiet title claim, and the meaning of\n\nthe federal statute is actually in dispute; it appears to be the\n\nonly legal and factual dispute.”) (emphasis added).\n\n          Grable thus requires us to undertake two inquiries:\n\nwhether (i) the Cambridge state-law complaint, on its face, and\n\nwithout reference to any possible defenses, “necessarily” discloses\n\nan “actual” and “substantial” dispute concerning the interpretation\n\nof the Copyright Act; and (ii) invocation of the SFQ exception\n\nwould be consistent with any congressional policy in enacting the\n\nCopyright Act as to the proper balancing of jurisdiction between\n\nthe federal and state courts.20\n\n\n     20\n          We often cite the principle set forth in T.B. Harms Co.\nv. Eliscu, 339 F.2d 823, 828 (2d Cir. 1964) (noting that a claim\n“arises under” the Copyright Act if, inter alia, it “asserts a\nclaim requiring construction of the Act”), as a device to establish\nthe absence of federal question jurisdiction, see, e.g., id. at 827\n(noting that “if any aspect of the suit requires an interpretation\nof the Copyright Act, the complaint does not reveal it”) (emphasis\nadded), but we have been reluctant to embrace the test as a\nreliable means to establish the presence of SFQ jurisdiction. See,\ne.g., Genar-Villar, 417 F.3d at 206 n.5 (“We need not decide\nwhether the Puerto Rico court’s analysis of federal copyright\npreemption law [viz., that it lacked jurisdiction to decide\ncopyright ownership interests] was precisely correct because, in\nany event, the [] court viewed its jurisdiction as limited to\nPuerto Rico claims.”); First Fed. Sav. and Loan Ass’n v. Greenwald,\n591 F.2d 417, 423 (1st Cir. 1979) (noting that “some circuits have\ntaken a broader view of federal question jurisdiction, namely that\n‘(e)ven though the claim is created by state law, a case may “arise\nunder” a law of the United States if the complaint discloses a need\nfor determining the meaning or application of such a law,’” but\nthen refusing to decide whether or not to adopt that rule as\n\n                                  -40-\n\f     2.     The “Actual” and “Substantial” Dispute Criterion\n\n            Like the plaintiff’s complaint in De Sylva, 351 U.S. 570,\n\nsupra, the Grable complaint – on its face – placed the meaning of\n\na federal statute in active dispute.         If the Grable defendant\n\neventually did not challenge the plaintiff’s interpretation of the\n\nfederal seizure-notification statute, it necessarily would lose the\n\nlawsuit, because it would thereby concede its violation of its\n\nfiduciary   duty   under   state   corporation   law.   Thus,   it   was\n\nreasonable to anticipate, from the complaint itself, that the\n\nfederal constitutional issue was substantial and that it would have\n\nto be adjudicated.\n\n            By contrast, although the Cambridge complaint may depend\n\nin the abstract on Seemann’s original copyright co-ownership, that\n\nfact alone is insufficient to satisfy Grable’s heightened “active\n\ndispute” test. The ultimate success of the Cambridge complaint may\n\ndepend on an actual adjudication of any number of issues, federal\n\nand non-federal, which are not yet apparent at the pleading stage.\n\nSee Royal v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc., 833 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (finding no jurisdiction, even though, if plaintiff succeeded\n\nin obtaining contract rescission, the court would need to apply 17\n\nU.S.C. § 201(b) to defeat his claim; “[t]he work-made-for-hire\n\n\n\ncircuit law) (citation omitted); see also Royal v. Leading Edge\nProds., Inc., 833 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987) (referring to the T.B.\nHarms test as merely “the most frequently cited test,” but finding\nno federal jurisdiction).\n\n                                   -41-\n\fdoctrine is, at best, only tangentially implicated [and] [i]ndeed,\n\nit is not even mentioned in the complaint”); see also Cambridge\n\nLiterary, 295 F.3d at 64 n.4 (“It is possible to imagine a\n\nMassachusetts court looking to federal copyright law and German\n\ncontract law as to whether Hummel, Seemann, and Fink are co-owners;\n\nAustrian inheritance law if the Seemann rights are disputed;\n\nfederal copyright law as to whether the figurines are derivative\n\nworks; and to the law of any of several jurisdictions as to rights\n\nand defenses among co-owners and available remedies.”); Derminer v.\n\nKramer, 386 F. Supp. 2d 905, 912 (E.D. Mich. 2005).              For example,\n\nGoebel   itself    notes   that,   if    Goebel   denies   the   allegation,\n\nCambridge eventually may need to prove as well that the Hummel\n\nfigurines were “derivative works” from the illustrations contained\n\nin Das Hummelbuch, see 17 U.S.C. § 101, and failure to establish\n\nthat   fact    might   prove   equally   dispositive   and   fatal    to   the\n\naccounting claim.        Grable makes clear, however, that the mere\n\npresence of these potential federal issues is insufficient to\n\ncreate SFQ jurisdiction.\n\n              Unlike the plaintiff in De Sylva, who expressly included\n\nin his complaint a request for a declaration of his co-ownership\n\nrights in the copyright, the Cambridge complaint does not place its\n\nco-ownership of the copyright in “active dispute.”           Such an active\n\ndispute would arise, if at all, at the time Goebel files its answer\n\nto the complaint, see supra note 16, and pursuant to the well-\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\fpleaded   complaint   rule,      this    is   insufficient       to       invoke      SFQ\n\njurisdiction.    Further, it simply is not the case that Goebel\n\nnecessarily will forfeit its chances of winning the case if it\n\nchooses not to contest the Cambridge co-ownership interests.                          If\n\nGoebel stipulates to the Cambridge co-ownership rights under 17\n\nU.S.C. §§ 101 and 201(a), it will have done no more than concede\n\nCambridge’s standing to bring suit under state law.\n\n     3.    The “Congressional Intent” Requirement\n\n           Application     of    the    SFQ   exception     to    this         type    of\n\naccounting claim between copyright co-owners also would serve no\n\napparent congressional policy concerning the proper allocation of\n\njurisdictional labor between the federal and state courts in cases\n\nwhich happen to involve copyrighted material. See Templeton Bd. of\n\nSewer Comm’rs v. Am. Tissue Mills of Mass., Inc., 352 F.3d 33, 40-\n\n41 (1st Cir. 2003) (“We do not believe that merely because a court\n\nwill have to interpret the federal regulations, it necessarily\n\nfollows   that   federal        jurisdiction      exists.    .        .    .    ‘[T]he\n\ndetermination    of   whether      a    federal    issue     is       sufficiently\n\nsubstantial should be informed by a sensitive judgment about\n\nwhether the existence of federal judicial power is both appropriate\n\nand pragmatic,’ and . . . ‘at bottom, we must determine whether the\n\ndispute is one that Congress intended federal courts to resolve.’”)\n\n(citations omitted); Nimmer on Copyright § 12.01.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -43-\n\f            The Copyright Act and its preemption provision expressly\n\napply to acts of copyright infringement, viz., the unauthorized use\n\nand exploitation of copyrighted materials by a person who neither\n\nowns the copyright nor has a valid license.           See 17 U.S.C. § 301(a)\n\n(preempting    only   those   “legal   and    equitable    rights   that   are\n\nequivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope\n\nof copyright as specified in § 106”) (emphasis added); id. § 106\n\n(providing that “the owner of copyright under this title has the\n\nexclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following\n\n[acts].”) (emphasis added). By definition, however, a co-owner who\n\nprofits from the copyright cannot “infringe” or make “unauthorized\n\nuse” of the copyright, as that concept is defined in 17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 106.     See Weissmann v. Freeman, 868 F.2d 1313, 1318 (2nd Cir.\n\n1989) (“[A]n action for infringement between joint owners will not\n\nlie because an individual cannot infringe his own copyright”);\n\nQuintanilla v. Tex. Television, Inc., 3 F. Supp. 2d 747, 753 (S.D.\n\nTex. 1997), aff’d, 139 F.3d 494 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n            Instead, the Copyright Act, which sets forth express\n\nremedies    available   to    copyright      owners    against   infringers,\n\ndeliberately omits any comparable express or implied remedy for a\n\nco-owner seeking an accounting from a joint copyright owner who has\n\nprofited from use of the copyright.          The Act’s legislative history\n\nunambiguously explains the reason for this omission: “[t]here is .\n\n. . no need for a specific statutory provision concerning [the]\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\frights and duties of the coowners of a work; court-made law on this\n\npoint is left undisturbed.”        H.R. Rep. No. 94-1676, at 121,\n\nreprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5736. To the extent that this\n\nresidual court-made law involves the common-law rights of tenants\n\nin common, the primary source always has been state (and not\n\nfederal) law, and the Copyright Act contains no hint that Congress\n\nintended to usurp the state courts’ traditional jurisdiction to\n\nadjudicate these types of claims. See Nimmer on Copyright § 6.10;\n\nGoodman, 78 F.3d at 1012 (“The applicability of federal law ends\n\nwith that determination [of non-preemption], as Goodman's claim for\n\nan accounting is governed in all respects by state law. It is\n\nwidely recognized that ‘[a] co-owner of a copyright must account to\n\nother co-owners for any profits he earns from the licensing or use\n\nof the copyright . . . .’    Significantly, ‘the duty to account does\n\nnot derive from the copyright law's proscription of infringement.\n\nRather, it comes from “. . . general principles of law governing\n\nthe rights of co-owners.”’    As those general principles are rooted\n\nin state law, we look to the law of Louisiana for answers to the\n\nremaining issues presented by this appeal.”) (citations omitted);\n\nOddo v. Ries, 743 F.2d 630, 633 n.2 (9th Cir. 1984) (same,\n\nconcluding that “a suit to bring the co-owner of a copyright to\n\naccount does not fall within the district court’s jurisdiction over\n\nactions arising under [§ 1338]\"); Dead Kennedys v. Biafra, 37 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1151, 1153 (N.D.

See, e.g., Merrell Dow, 478 U.S. at 817\n\n(“[A]      [state-law      negligence]         complaint     [against    a     drug\n\nmanufacturer] alleging a violation of a federal statute [viz., a\n\nfederal statute banning misbranding of prescription drugs] as an\n\nelement of a state cause of action, when Congress has determined\n\nthat there should be no private, federal cause of action for the\n\nviolation, does not state a claim ‘arising under’” § 1331.”).21\n\n                Because Cambridge’s state-law accounting meets neither of\n\nthe two SFQ jurisdictional criteria elaborated in Grable, it cannot\n\nbe said to “arise under” the Copyright Act.\n\nB.    Complete Preemption\n\n                 Similarly, the complete preemption doctrine does not\n\npermit     us    to   disregard    the    well-pleaded      complaint   rule    and\n\n\n\n      21\n          Further evidence of a lack of congressional intention can\nbe seen in the Copyright Act’s statute-of-limitations provision.\nRather than stating, in typical fashion, that the limitations\nperiod applies to all actions “arising under” the Act, the\nlimitations apply only to those claims “maintained under” the Act.\n17 U.S.C. § 507(b) (emphasis added); see Goodman, 78 F.3d at 1013\n(noting that even though state-law accounting claim arises under\nCopyright Act for jurisdictional purposes, the Act’s three-year\nlimitations period is not triggered, because the Act contains no\nremedy as between copyright co-owners, and thus the accounting\nclaim cannot be said to be “maintained” under the Act, but instead\nis maintained under state law).\n\n                                         -46-\n\frecharacterize – as mere “artful pleading” – the Cambridge state-\n\nlaw accounting claim as a federal-law claim “arising under” the\n\nCopyright      Act.22     The     Act   plainly     does    not   exert    such   an\n\noverpowering preemptive force as to bring under the federal courts’\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction all state-law causes of action between\n\nco-owners of a copyrighted work.           See Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 393\n\n(observing      that    federal    statute’s      preemptive      effect   must   be\n\n“extraordinary” to trigger complete preemption); Metro. Life Ins.\n\nCo. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 64 (1987).              Federal courts, as courts\n\nof   limited    jurisdiction,       should     implement     federal    preemption\n\ndoctrines as narrowly as possible.              See Lontz v. Tharp, 413 F.3d\n\n435, 440 (4th Cir. 2005) (noting that there is a rebuttable\n\npresumption      against     finding      complete        preemption,      so   that\n\n“[d]efendants' burden is to demonstrate that a federal statute\n\nindisputably displaces any state cause of action over a given\n\nsubject matter”) (citation omitted); see also Charles A.

Complete preemption analysis thus depends on the\n\nexistence of palpable evidence that Congress intended to displace\n\ncompletely a particular category of state-law causes of action, as\n\nmanifested by the federal statute’s language, overall structure,\n\nand legislative history.    See Metro. Life, 481 U.S. at 65; Magee v.\n\nExxon Corp., 135 F.3d 599, 601-02 (8th Cir. 1998).\n\n            Unlike the few federal statutes which have been found to\n\neffect complete preemption (e.g., the governance of the Employee\n\nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) over all plan-“related”\n\ncauses of action, see Metro. Life, 481 U.S. at 67; Hotz v. Blue\n\nCross and Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 292 F.3d 57, 59 (1st Cir.\n\n2002)), the Copyright Act does not encompass all claims simply\n\nbecause the parties’ dispute happens to involve a copyrighted work.\n\nSee Venegas-Hernández v. Asociación de Compositores y Editores de\n\nMúsica Latinoamericana, 424 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2005) (“The\n\nCopyright Act does not draw into federal court all matters that\n\npertain to copyright.”); Royal, 833 F.2d at 2.            Further, although\n\nthe Copyright Act (unlike ERISA, for example) gives the federal\n\ncourts exclusive (rather than concurrent) jurisdiction over any\n\nclaims which arise under the Act, see 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a), this\n\njurisdictional canon necessarily presupposes an antecedent inquiry\n\nas to whether a particular state-law cause of action involving a\n\n\n\n\n                                   -48-\n\fcopyrighted work can be said to “arise under” the Act in the first\n\ninstance.\n\n            Unlike ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a) (providing that ERISA\n\n“shall supersede any and all State laws” to the extent that those\n\nlaws “relate to any employee benefit plan”) (emphasis added), the\n\nCopyright   Act’s   preemption   provisions      are    not   even   remotely\n\npanoptic.     The   Copyright   Act   preempts   only    those   “legal   and\n\nequitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights\n\nwithin the general scope of copyright as specified in § 106.”              17\n\nU.S.C. § 301(a) (emphasis added). Further, “[n]othing in [the Act]\n\nannuls or limits any rights or remedies under the common law or\n\nstatutes of any State with respect to – . . . activities violating\n\nlegal or equitable rights that are not the equivalent to any of the\n\nexclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified\n\nin section 106A with respect to works of visual art.”                     Id.\n\n§ 301(b)(3) (emphasis added); see Blab T.V. of Mobile, Inc. v.\n\nComcast Cable Commc'ns, Inc., 182 F.3d 851, 857 (11th Cir. 1999)\n\n(finding no complete preemption because the federal Cable Act\n\ncontained language which “preserv[ed] state authority except in\n\nareas in which the exercise of this authority would be inconsistent\n\nwith federal law”); cf.

Congress must have intended that\n\nco-authors may claim for an accounting or otherwise proceed under\n\ncommon law principles.”).    Indeed, as previously noted, the Act’s\n\nlegislative history plainly discloses Congress’ intent to leave\n\nsuch disputes outside the federal court’s exclusive copyright\n\njurisdiction. See H.R. Rep. No. 94-1676, at 121, reprinted in 1976\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5736.\n\n           As the Cambridge state-law accounting claim runs afoul of\n\nneither   the   SFQ   jurisdictional    criterion,   nor   the   complete\n\n\n\n\n                                 -51-\n\fpreemption criterion, it does not “arise under” the Copyright Act.24\n\nHence, the Act’s three-year limitations period is not applicable.25\n\n\n\n     24\n          Assuming arguendo that the Copyright Act’s limitations\nperiod applied to the Cambridge accounting claim, I would be\ncompelled to dissent. In my view, Cambridge has demonstrated on\nappeal that several material factual disputes remain as to when its\naccounting claim accrued, thus precluding, as a matter of law, any\nRule 56 determination of the accrual date. See Massey v. United\nStates, 312 F.3d 272, 276 (7th Cir. 2002) (“Summary judgment is\nproperly granted on the basis of a statute of limitations defense\nif . . . there exist no genuine issues of material fact regarding\nthe time at which plaintiff's claim has accrued.”).\n     25\n          The district court held, in the alternative, that even if\nthe Copyright Act’s three-year limitations period did not apply to\nthe Cambridge accounting claim, the claim still would be governed\nby the state’s three-year limitations period applicable to tort\nactions. This alternative holding is demonstrably wrong, for two\nreasons.   First, Goebel would be estopped from asserting this\nargument by its previous statement, in its first appeal on the\npersonal jurisdiction issue, that Cambridge “does not assert a\ncause of action based on tortious activity either within or outside\nMassachusetts.” See Cadle Co. v. Schlichtmann, Conway, Crowley &\nHugo, 338 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2003) (“‘We generally will not\npermit litigants to assert contradictory positions at different\nstages of a lawsuit in order to advance their interests.’”)\n(citation omitted). Second, the Cambridge accounting claim does\nnot allege that Goebel wrongly retained or converted profits that\nit derived from Das Hummelbuch, nor could it do so because, as a\nco-owner of the copyrighted work, Goebel is free to use the\ncopyright to its fullest. See Goodman, 78 F.3d at 1012. Only once\nits co-owners make a suitable demand for an accounting would Goebel\nhave an equitable duty to account to all of its co-owners for their\nrespective shares of those profits. See Bacon v. Bacon, 165 N.E.\n485, 488 (Mass. 1929); Dapkus v. Dapkus, No. 269521-KFS, 2007 WL\n1229399, at *3 (Mass. Land Ct. Apr. 26, 2007) (unpublished); see\nalso Goodman, 78 F.3d at 1013 (“Under Louisiana law, an action by\na co-owner for an accounting is governed by a ten-year prescriptive\nperiod (statute of limitations), which ‘d[oes] not begin to run\nuntil demand is made . . . for an accounting.’”) (citation\nomitted); Bushner v. Bushner, 307 P.2d 204, 208 (Colo. 1957);\nGoergen v. Maar, 153 N.Y.S.2d 826, 831 (N.Y. App. Div. 1956);\nHarrell v. Samson Res. Co., 980 P.2d 99, 107 (Okla. 1998); Hallmark\nv.

The Affirmative Defense of Preemption\n\n           The district court dismissed the Cambridge complaint on\n\nthe   ground    that   the   Copyright       Act   preempted     the   Cambridge\n\naccounting claim.        Many of the same factors that preclude our\n\nfinding that the Copyright Act completely preempts the Cambridge\n\nstate-law accounting claim likewise would militate against any\n\nfinding for Goebel at summary judgment on its preemption defense.\n\nSee Fifth Third Bank, 415 F.3d at 745 (noting that preemption is an\n\naffirmative offense upon which defendant bears the burden of\n\nproof); see also Brown v. Earthboard Sports USA, 481 F.3d 901, 913\n\n(6th Cir. 2007).       With respect to the preemption of state-law\n\ncauses of action involving copyrighted works, we have applied the\n\ntwo-pronged “subject matter”/“extra-element” test, Data Gen. Corp.\n\nv. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147, 1164-65 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (finding no Copyright Act preemption of state-law claim for\n\ntrade   secrets   misappropriation      because     latter      involved   “extra\n\nelement” – viz., breach of a fiduciary duty – not found in a\n\ncopyright infringement claim); see also Dun & Bradstreet Software\n\nServs., Inc. v. Grace Consulting, Inc., 307 F.3d 197, 217-19 (3d\n\nCir. 2002); Computer Mgmt. Assistance Co. v. Robert F. DeCastro,\n\nInc., 220 F.3d 396, 404-05 (5th Cir. 2000), and again inquire\n\nwhether   the   particular    state    law    at   issue   is    the   functional\n\nequivalent of a federal copyright infringement action, or instead\n\nis qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim.\n\n\n                                      -53-\n\fSee 17 U.S.C. § 301(a) (preempting state causes of action which are\n\npremised on rights “equivalent to” copyright-holder’s exclusive\n\nrights of use set forth in § 106\"); Stromback v. New Line Cinema,\n\n384 F.3d 283, 301 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\n              Under the Data General test, the state-law accounting\n\nclaim between co-owners of a copyrighted work, which sounds neither\n\nin contract nor tort, but in equitable principles of trust as\n\nbetween joint property owners, see, e.g., Bacon v. Bacon, 165 N.E.\n\n485,    473    (Mass.   1929)   (describing    co-owner   relationship   as\n\nfiduciary in nature); supra note 25, is not preempted because it is\n\nnot the qualitative equivalent of a copyright infringement claim\n\nunder   the    Copyright   Act.     Further,    the   Cambridge   state-law\n\naccounting claim requires an extra element not found in a copyright\n\ninfringement case: an existing equitable trust relationship between\n\nthe parties.       In Data General, the relationship was fiduciary;\n\nhere, the relationship is joint ownership of property giving rise\n\nto an equitable duty to provide an accounting of profits.                The\n\nCopyright Act does not preempt the state-law accounting claim, and\n\nthus it cannot be dismissed on preemption grounds.\n\n                                     III\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n              In order to bring the Cambridge state-law cause of action\n\nunder the Copyright Act’s three-year limitations provision, the\n\nmajority announces a blanket jurisdictional rule which threatens to\n\n\n                                     -54-\n\fdraw into the federal courts many copyright-related claims over\n\nwhich Congress deliberately intended to give the state courts\n\nconcurrent   jurisdiction.   As    the   state   courts   are   perfectly\n\ncompetent to interpret Copyright Act definitions that may be\n\ntangentially relevant to their disposition of state-law causes of\n\naction, the mere possibility that they may need to consult those\n\nstatutory definitions should not convert claims which essentially\n\narise under state law into federal claims, particularly where the\n\ncorresponding federal statute has eschewed comparable remedies.\n\nTherefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -55-\n\f",

W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. &amp; Co. Kg. (Cambridge II),</i> 448 F.Supp.2d 244 (D.Mass.2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p>The key facts are set forth here and in our earlier opinion on a different issue in this case. <i>Cambridge Literary Properties, Ltd. v. W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. &amp; Co. Kg. (Cambridge I),</i> 295 F.3d 59, 61-62 (1st Cir.2002). Plaintiff Cambridge Literary Properties, Ltd. seeks a share of the profits reaped by defendants W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. &amp; Co. Kg. and Goebel Art G.m.b.H. (collectively, \"Goebel\") for the use of images taken from a German book published in 1934, <i>Das Hummel-Buch,</i> in which Cambridge asserts a copyright interest. Specifically, Cambridge, which acquired its purported \"rights\" from two sets of heirs of a putative joint author of the book, seeks an accounting and imposition of trust on past and future profits Goebel realizes from the distribution of figurines derived from the book, Goebel's use of the particular figure of \"The Merry Wanderer\" as its trademark or logo, the membership fees in the M.I. Hummel Club in the United States, and the like. Whether Cambridge in fact is a co-owner, through co-authorship, of any of its asserted rights is hotly contested by Goebel in its summary judgment papers and its brief on appeal. Indeed, Cambridge's complaint asserts facts acknowledging Goebel's claims of sole ownership.</p>\n<p>The federal courts clearly have jurisdiction over this case. Cambridge chose to file the action in federal district court, and jurisdiction has never been at issue. We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment, affirming the recommendation of the magistrate judge. Plaintiff's ownership of any interest, as we have said, is hotly disputed, and is an issue governed by the Copyright Act. There is no agreement or stipulation of ownership. Yet Cambridge did not seek an adjudication of its ownership rights before seeking whatever remedy it may have if it has any ownership rights. Thus, this case is not a dispute between admitted co-owners. Rather, the complaint attempts to evade the issue of whether Cambridge has any ownership rights by simply asserting that Cambridge is a co-owner and then alleging that Cambridge, as a co-owner, is entitled under state law to an accounting and equitable trust. As a result, Cambridge argues, the federal statute of limitations that applies to establishing copyright ownership under the Copyright Act does not apply; rather, the state statute of limitations for an accounting applies.</p>\n<p>The accounting and equitable trust claims created by state law are premature. Such claims may well be governed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> by state law, but they are not ripe and necessarily rest upon plaintiff having met the antecedent showing that it has ownership rights under the Copyright Act. Plaintiff may not assert the state-law claims for accounting or equitable trust without establishing that it is a co-owner. Whether Cambridge is a co-owner in turn depends, on the facts of this case,<sup>[1]</sup> upon the federal Copyright Act. This in turn requires that Cambridge have asserted its ownership claims within that statute's limitations period. The congressional intent that the Act's limitations period applies to claims of ownership under the Act may not be undercut by Cambridge's subterfuge.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the Act, the cause of action accrues when a plaintiff \"knows or has reason to know of the act which is the basis of the claim.\" <i>Santa-Rosa v. Combo Records,</i> 471 F.3d 224, 227 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2265, 167 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2007) (internal quotation omitted). We reject plaintiff's novel approach to accrual. Cambridge may not escape the limitations bar if the statute barred the claims of the heirs from which it acquired the \"rights.\" <i>Young v. Lepone,</i> 305 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir.2002). Cambridge is also barred if it failed to timely act within the limitations period after it acquired the rights. Here, Cambridge and the heirs, on the undisputed facts, were put on sufficient notice to result in accrual more than three years before plaintiff instituted suit. Further, there is no basis for equitable tolling of the three-year limitations period.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>In describing the facts of the dispute, we make all reasonable inferences in favor of Cambridge, the party opposing summary judgment. <i>T-Peg, Inc. v. Vermont Timber Works, Inc.,</i> 459 F.3d 97, 102 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Berta Hummel, as a young woman in Germany in the early 20th century, had a talent for drawing images of children in folk dress. In 1931, Hummel took her vows as a member of the Congregation of Franciscan Sisters at the Convent of Siessen (\"Convent\") and became Sister Maria Innocentia Hummel. Sister Hummel and the Convent published some of Sister Hummel's drawings as postcards and devotional pictures.</p>\n<p>In 1934, a German publishing company, Emil Fink Verlag (\"Fink\"), approached Sister Hummel and the Convent about publishing some of Sister Hummel's artworks in a book. In May of that year, Sister Hummel, the Superior of the Convent, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> and Fink entered into an agreement authorizing Fink to reproduce forty of Sister Hummel's works in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> The contract specified that the book would include, in addition to the drawings, poems and other text. About six months later, Fink contracted with Margarete Seemann, a Viennese poet, for the production of an introduction and fifty poems for use in the book.</p>\n<p>Fink first published <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> in Germany in December 1934. Fink applied to the United States Copyright Office for a copyright in the book in June 1936. Fink's application lists Emil Fink Verlag as the \"copyright owner,\" and Hummel and Seemann as \"author[s] or translator[s].\"</p>\n<p>Back in Germany, Fink was not the only firm seeking to commercialize Sister Hummel's drawings. Franz Goebel, then the head of Goebel, also entered into a contract with Sister Hummel and the Convent in January 1935. In that contract, Sister Hummel and the Convent assigned to Goebel the exclusive right to manufacture and market porcelain figurines based on Sister Hummel's drawings. Goebel continues to produce its line of \"M.I. Hummel figurines\" to this day. Goebel Art, a wholly owned subsidiary of Goebel, acts as the exclusive distributor and licensing agent for Goebel's United States copyright interests derived from the 1935 contract. In addition to the sale of figurines, Goebel also profits from the Hummel copyrights through Goebel Art's \"M.I. Hummel Club,\" which generates substantial income from membership fees.</p>\n<p>In June 1962, Fink applied for a renewal copyright in \"<i>Das Hummel-Buch,</i> by Berta Hummel . . . [preface and verses by] Margarete Seemann.\" The publishing house listed itself as \"proprietor of copyright in a work made for hire.\" In 1971, Goebel purchased all of Fink's copyrights in Hummel-related works, including the American copyright in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> That sale was also memorialized in documents filed with the Copyright Office.</p>\n<p>Goebel was not always the sole American distributor of Hummel figurines. Until the mid-1990s, Goebel contracted with Schmid Brothers, Inc. (\"Schmid\") to distribute the figurines in the United States. Schmid and Goebel quarreled repeatedly over their business arrangement in the courts of Germany and the United States. Sometime in the late 1960s, an attorney named Henry Herrmann began working for Schmid on matters related to disputes with Goebel. By 1971, Herrmann had obtained for Schmid an assignment of copyrights from Sister Hummel's family; Sister Hummel had died in 1946. Herrmann also represented Schmid in a number of lawsuits pertaining to the Hummel rights. Herrman is the driving force behind Cambridge in the present dispute.</p>\n<p>In 1992, during a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of New York, Schmid and Goebel entered into a consent judgment that stated that the two parties owned \"respective undivided one-half interests in the United States renewal copyright in [<i>Das Hummel-Buch</i>].\" Herrmann executed the agreement on behalf of Schmid.</p>\n<p>Schmid, which held interests in <i>Das Hummel-Buch,</i> filed for bankruptcy in 1993. Herrmann, as a creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings, filed a claim for over $10,000,000 based on a contingency fee agreement with his former client. Herrmann settled his claim for $3,750,000. Goebel, for its part, acquired Schmid's rights to the book in the wake of Schmid's bankruptcy. With that acquisition, Goebel's ownership interest in the United States copyright to <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> appeared to be perfected.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> At some point during the Goebel-Schmid litigation, Herrmann came to think that Margarete Seemann's heirs might retain an interest in the United States copyright for <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> because Seemann's poems appear in the book. In order to exploit that interest, Herrmann sought an assignment of copyright interests from Seemann's heirs. Herrmann formed Cambridge in August 1995 to effectuate that purpose. Herrmann continues to be the sole shareholder in Cambridge in addition to representing the company in this litigation.</p>\n<p>Also in 1995, Herrmann identified Seemann's heirs and assignees of Seemann's alleged United States copyright interests in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> They were Maria Romanowicz, a resident of Vienna, and Dr. Alexandrine Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic, a resident of Belgrade. Herrmann approached both heirs in August and September of 1995 with offers to purchase such United States copyright interests as they held in the book.</p>\n<p>On September 6, 1995, Maria Romanowicz signed a contract assigning to Cambridge all of her \"right, title and interest in and to any and all United States Copyright Renewals in any of the works authored and/or co-authored by [Seemann], including, without limitation, the work `Das Hummel-Buch.'\" The contract also specified that \"included in this assignment are any and all of my legal and/or equitable monetary claims and causes of action I may have under American laws as of the date hereof for payments . . . and/or accountings against third parties\" for their exploitation of the United States copyright to <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> As to the other heir, although Herrmann first approached Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic in 1995, he did not obtain an assignment from her to Cambridge until February 1999. The terms of the second assignment were identical to the first.</p>\n<p>Having thus assembled what it represented to be a fifty-percent interest (based on any interest held by the poet Seemann) in the United States copyright to <i>Das Hummel-Buch,</i> Cambridge filed the current action in the District of Massachusetts in February 2000, basing jurisdiction on diversity and, conditionally, on federal question jurisdiction.<sup>[3]</sup> Cambridge's complaint pleaded two \"claims\": one for \"an accounting from [Goebel] of their profits from their use and benefit of said book and the two and three dimensional works derived therefrom\"; and a separate claim for unjust enrichment seeking as a remedy \"restitution and [] a decree imposing a constructive trust . . . on [Goebel's] intellectual property relating to the works derived from the [b]ook.\" The complaint states, in conclusory fashion, that Cambridge is entitled to these remedies due to its status as \"joint legal and/or beneficial owner[] of the United States Renewal Copyright\" in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i><sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> Cambridge does not claim it owns any independent copyright interests in any images created by Sister Hummel. Rather, it says its rights are derivative from Seemann.<sup>[5]</sup> Seemann, Cambridge alleges, obtained an interest in the United States copyright for <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> by virtue of her co-author status with Hummel and/or Fink. Cambridge alleges the book was a \"joint work\" between Hummel and Seemann, and that the copyright in the book therefore granted Seemann rights in all the contents of the book, including Hummel's illustrations. Cambridge further alleges that Goebel based the designs of at least some of the Hummel figurines on particular images from the book, and not on Hummel artworks of independent provenance. Those figurines, according to Cambridge, represented works derivative of the book. Cambridge, assignee of Seemann's heirs and half-owner, along with Goebel, of the book copyright, would thus be entitled to half of the proceeds of all exploitation of the book copyright in the United States. From these co-ownership rights, Cambridge argues, it is owed an accounting for Goebel's profits from the sale of at least some of its figurines and other uses of Hummel imagery in the United States. Goebel has disputed these contentions throughout this litigation.</p>\n<p>The district court initially dismissed Cambridge's suit for want of personal jurisdiction. This court reversed and remanded. <i>Cambridge I,</i> 295 F.3d at 66-68. On remand, the district court again did not reach the merits of Cambridge's accounting or unjust enrichment claims. Instead, it granted Goebel's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the Copyright Act's three-year statute of limitations barred Cambridge's suit. <i>Cambridge II,</i> 448 F.Supp.2d at 247; <i>see also</i> 17 U.S.C. § 507(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review de novo the entry of summary judgment in the district court. <i>T-Peg,</i> 459 F.3d at 111. Summary judgment is proper here if the record, read favorably to Cambridge, reflects no genuine issues of material fact and the undisputed facts demonstrate that Goebel is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>T-Peg,</i> 459 F.3d at 111; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p>Cambridge contends on appeal that Massachusetts law governs a claim for accounting for profits, and that consequently the Copyright Act's statute of limitations does not apply. The issue is more complicated than that. This framing of the argument assumes that the question of ownership had been resolved, by agreement or by a court judgment, before the state-law remedy of accounting was sought. An action brought by a copyright co-owner seeking equitable remedies from another co-owner, even if those remedies are governed by state law, requires that the plaintiff first establish the existence of the right giving rise to the remedy. <i>See, e.g., MacDonald v. Page Co.,</i> 251 Mass. 299, 146 N.E. 727 (1925); 1A C.J.S. <i>Accounting</i> § 23 (2007). In the case of an accounting for profits by a co-owner of a copyright where ownership is in dispute, that means the claimant must first establish it has ownership as a predicate to an award of an accounting for profits. The ownership question may be one of state law or of federal law, depending on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> facts of a case. In cases involving rights such as those at issue here, plaintiffs usually raise this threshold issue by seeking a declaratory judgment for ownership. <i>See </i><i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 225-26; <i>Royal v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc.,</i> 833 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1987); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Gaiman v. McFarlane,</i> 360 F.3d 644, 648 (7th Cir. 2004); <i>Merchant v.

Lee (Goodman II),</i> 78 F.3d 1007, 1009 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>Cambridge's complaint does not request a declaration of its co-ownership of the United States copyright in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> It both asserts ownership and acknowledges that Cambridge's ownership is in controversy. The omission does not remove the predicate question of ownership from the case, and whether Cambridge has any ownership interest is in dispute, even on the face of the complaint.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Applicability of the Copyright Act</i></p>\n<p>Copyright cases may raise different issues, some of which are controlled by federal law and some of which may refer to and be controlled by state law. We noted as much about this very case in <i>Cambridge I. See</i> 295 F.3d at 64 n. 4 (recognizing that Cambridge's claims might necessitate reference to \"federal copyright law and German contract law as to whether Hummel, Seemann, and Fink are co-owners; Austrian inheritance law if the Seemann rights are disputed; federal copyright law as to whether the figurines are derivative works; and to the law of any of several jurisdictions as to the rights and defenses among co-owners\").</p>\n<p>Here the necessary initial question ownership of copyright interestsis governed by the Copyright Act. Because that question is governed by the Act, the Act's statute of limitations applies as well. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 507(b) (\"No civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued.\"). It would be anomalous and, we think, contrary to congressional language and intent not to apply the Act's limitations period when the Act governs the question of ownership interest.</p>\n<p>Our view that a single copyright case can raise different issues governed by different laws is well accepted. In an instructive if not directly parallel case, the Supreme Court addressed the applicability of federal and state law in actions asserting copyright interests. In <i>De Sylva v. Ballentine,</i> 351 U.S. 570, 76 S.Ct. 974, 100 L.Ed. 1415 (1956), the mother of the illegitimate child of a deceased composer sued for a declaratory judgment that the child possessed an interest in the renewal copyrights of the composer's works; the mother also sought an accounting for past profits. <i>Id.</i> at 571-72, 76 S.Ct. 974. The ownership determination hinged on a provision in the Copyright Act, then in effect, which was ambiguous on two issues: whether children of authors could inherit copyright renewal rights during the lifetime of the author's widow; and whether \"children,\" as used within the Copyright Act, included illegitimate offspring. <i>Id.</i> at 572, 76 S.Ct. 974.</p>\n<p>The Court held that \"[t]he scope of a federal right is, of course, a federal question,\" and interpreted the ambiguous Copyright Act provision to resolve the ownership issue. <i>Id.</i> at 580, 76 S.Ct. 974. The Court did reference state law in the course of construing the Act. As to the discrete issue of whether the term \"children\" included illegitimate offspring, the Court noted that \"there is no federal law of domestic relations, which is primarily a matter of state concern.\" <i>Id.</i> Because the federal Act did not address the issue at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> hand, which was \"really a question of the descent of property,\" the Court looked to the California Probate Code, the source of law that would govern descent of the composer's estate, to give content to the term \"children\" as used in the Copyright Act. <i>Id.</i> at 581-82, 76 S.Ct. 974.</p>\n<p>The current Copyright Act treats determinations of the rights at issue here as questions of authorship status and initial ownership of copyrights. Section 101 of the current Act expressly defines terms such as \"copyright owner,\" \"joint work,\" and \"work made for hire.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101. Section 201 of the Act explicitly controls vesting of copyright in authors; sets out the ownership status of authors and co-authors of joint works; and establishes copyright ownership by employers who commission works made for hire. 17 U.S.C. § 201. There is a substantial federal interest in having the federal statute of limitations applied to these determinations.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Act also contains a provision that expressly preempts state common-law copyright protection and all other \"legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright. . . .\" 17 U.S.C. § 301(a). That provision, while by its terms governs the preemption of causes of action, presupposes the existence of \"legal or equitable rights\" which are, in turn, defined elsewhere in the Act.</p>\n<p>Our concern is thus not, as Cambridge suggests, with whether the Act preempts a state accounting cause of action. That is a hypothetical question on the facts of this case, and we do not give advisory opinions. Our concern is only with whether the federal statute of limitations applies to the prerequisite issues of ownership which are governed by the Act.</p>\n<p>All of the federal circuit courts of appeal that have addressed the issue, including this one, agree that a determination of copyright ownership based on a disputed allegation of co-authorship presents a federal question that arises under, and must be determined according to, the Copyright Act. <i>See </i><i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 227; <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Gaiman,</i> 360 F.3d at 652-53; <i>Merchant,</i> 92 F.3d at 55-56; <i>Goodman II,</i> 78 F.3d at 1010.<sup>[6]</sup> Where an ownership claim arises under the Copyright Act, the Act's three-year statute of limitations likewise applies. <i>Gaiman,</i> 360 F.3d at 653; <i>see also </i><i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 227; <i>Merchant,</i> 92 F.3d at 56. Some cases address the question in the context of performing an \"arising under\" analysis to determine whether there is federal jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Merchant,</i> 92 F.3d at 55; <i>see also </i><i>Royal,</i> 833 F.2d at 2-3 (adopting test for original federal subject matter jurisdiction in <i>T.B. Harms v. Eliscu,</i> 339 F.2d 823 (2d Cir.1964)). Here, there is diversity jurisdiction, but the question of whether there is a federal question under the Copyright Act as to the prerequisite of co-ownership involves parallel reasoning.</p>\n<p>Cambridge attempts to avoid this conclusion by arguing that \"the Act's limitations do not apply to actions for accounting between co-owners.\" As we have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> said, that is not the issue. Cambridge argues that it is the fact that the action is one which the complaint labels as being for an accounting that makes the difference.<sup>[7]</sup> If co-ownership were conceded and the only question was a claim for accounting of profits from the other joint owner, then Cambridge could argue the suit was only for an accounting of profits under state law. <i>Gaiman,</i> 360 F.3d at 652. But under a long line of federal cases, Cambridge must first establish that it is a co-owner, and the answer to that lies in the application of the Copyright Act and subjects that claim to the Act's statute of limitations. <i>See id.</i> at 652-53. Cambridge cannot avoid this by the stratagem of failing to ask for a declaration of ownership as a method of avoiding the federal limitations period for an ownership claim governed by the federal Act.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Cambridge cites <i>Goodman II,</i> 78 F.3d 1007, as support for its argument. That case does not support Cambridge's position; it does support our view of the case. In <i>Goodman,</i> a musician sued the heirs of her former performing partner for a declaration of co-authorship and an accounting for royalties from the song \"Let the Good Times Roll.\" <i>Goodman v. Lee (Goodman I),</i> 815 F.2d 1030, 1031 (5th Cir.1987). The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> The Fifth Circuit reversed \"[b]ecause . . . exclusive federal district court jurisdiction exists in an action for a declaratory judgment to establish joint authorship of a copyrighted work. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 1032.</p>\n<p>After trial, the <i>Goodman</i> jury found that the plaintiff \"was a co-author of [the song]\" and that her claim was timely because \"she `did not know or should not have known'\" until the year before filing suit that her co-author had listed himself as the sole author on the copyright registration. <i>Goodman II,</i> 78 F.3d at 1010. Only after the co-authorship issue was resolved did the court address the issue of an accounting.</p>\n<p>On appeal in <i>Goodman,</i> the defendants contested the district court's remedial award of an accounting. The Fifth Circuit held that the remedy of an accounting did not itself present any federal questions, unlike the resolved predicate question of ownership, and that Louisiana law, including the state statute of limitations, governed the accounting issues. <i>Id.</i> at 1012-13.</p>\n<p>The <i>Goodman</i> decisions are entirely consistent with the prevailing view that disputed claims about whether there is co-authorship require application of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> Copyright Act and the Act's statute of limitations. The portion of the opinion that applied state law is inapposite here, because it dealt with accounting issues that only arose following a proper determination of copyright ownership under the Copyright Act. Cambridge has not cleared that hurdle of establishing ownership.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>The controversy over Cambridge's copyright interests directly involves Seemann's authorship status and her initial ownership of the copyright in <i>Das Hummel-Buch,</i> as well as the effect of various registration documents and transfers. The Copyright Act clearly covers these issues. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. §§ 101, 201, 204-05, 410. We hold as a matter of law that on the facts of this case, Cambridge's allegations of co-ownership present an issue subject to the Copyright Act and that the Act's three-year statute of limitations applies to that issue, which must be resolved before the issue of an accounting arises.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Application of the Act's Accrual Rules to These Claims</i></p>\n<p>The Copyright Act bars lawsuits premised on a copyright claim brought after three years from accrual of that claim. 17 U.S.C. § 507(b). A claim accrues when a plaintiff \"knows or has reason to know of the act which is the basis for the claim.\" <i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 227 (internal quotation omitted). If Cambridge's claims accrued earlier than February 24, 1997, three years before Cambridge filed the present suit, the suit is barred.</p>\n<p>In <i>Santa-Rosa,</i> we applied the accrual test to a 2004 suit by a renowned salsa musician requesting a declaration of co-ownership in several recordings he allegedly co-authored in the mid-1980s. 471 F.3d at 225-26. We affirmed dismissal of the suit as time-barred. <i>Id.</i> at 228.</p>\n<p><i>Santa-Rosa</i> held that the plaintiff knew or should have known of the basis for his claim to co-authorship of the songs at the moment of their creation. <i>Id.</i> After all, \"`[a] co-author knows that he or she jointly created a work from the moment of its creation,'\" and thus would have been aware at that time of a claim for co-ownership. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Merchant,</i> 92 F.3d at 56); <i>cf.</i> 17 U.S.C. § 101 (defining \"joint work\" as \"a work prepared by two or more authors with the <i>intention</i> that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole\" (emphasis added)). \"Thus,\" <i>Santa-Rosa</i> reasoned, \"there is little question that [plaintiff's] claims for co-ownership accrued as soon as he finished recording each album.\" 471 F.3d at 228. In <i>Santa-Rosa</i> the claimant was the co-author, and not an heir.</p>\n<p><i>Santa-Rosa</i> acknowledged, however, that other courts have applied the accrual test differently. For instance, the Ninth Circuit has held that a claim for a declaration of ownership under the Copyright Act does not accrue until \"a `plain and express repudiation of co-ownership is communicated to the claimant.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Zuill,</i> 80 F.3d at 1369). Even under this more claimant-friendly standard, however, the <i>Santa-Rosa</i> plaintiff could not prevail, because there was plain and express repudiation of co-ownership from the fact that the defendant record company \"openly, and quite notoriously, sold [plaintiff's] records without providing payment to him\" more than three years before the plaintiff filed suit. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> Under the reasoning of <i>Santa-Rosa,</i> the accrual inquiry in this case would initially be directed at Margarete Seemann and her knowledge of potential ownership claims in the 1930s. If, as Cambridge claims, Seemann had co-authored <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> as a joint work, she would by definition have been aware of her status as joint owner of the book and all of its contents. Seemann also conceivably received notice of a repudiation of her ownership status when Goebel began marketing Hummel figurines in the 1930s and failed to pay Seemann any royalties. Under a literal reading of <i>Santa-Rosa,</i> Seemann's claims for a declaration of co-authorship of the book would have accrued long before her death in 1949.</p>\n<p>The <i>Santa-Rosa</i> model for accrual does not work well here because the Copyright Act did not contain a statute of limitations for civil actions until 1957. <i>See</i> 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 12.05[A] (2007). We also do not reach the question of whether the claims based on Seemann's work accrued within three years after a statute of limitations was added to the Copyright Act. Instead, we ask whether any claims held by Cambridge and/or the assignors of the rights Cambridge alleges descended from Seemann accrued before the case was brought.</p>\n<p>1. <i>The Romanowicz Assignment</i></p>\n<p>Maria Romanowicz, Seemann's heir in Vienna, assigned whatever rights she may have had in the book's United States copyright to Cambridge by September 6, 1995. We do not address whether Romanowicz's rights were time-barred at that time.</p>\n<p>Cambridge did not file suit within three years of acquisition of those rights, and based on its knowledge at the time, the claim is barred. Cambridge was on notice of a repudiation of those rights by the time of the assignment. Herrmann, Cambridge's sole shareholder and negotiating adversary to Romanowicz, was privy to the Schmid-Goebel settlement agreement stipulating that those two companies owned all rights to the book in the United States. Moreover, Herrmann knew that Romanowicz was not receiving royalties from Goebel on the sale of Hummel figurines.</p>\n<p>The most cogent evidence of accrual is Cambridge's own motivation for approaching Romanowicz. What Cambridge sought to purchase was essentially a cause of action against Goebel. Cambridge was aware of whatever potential claims against Goebel the purchase would bolster, and even ensured that the assignment contract specified a transfer of any and all claims for accountings under United States law. With respect to the Romanowicz assignment, the statute of limitations under the Copyright Act started running against Cambridge no later than September 1995. Because there was no tolling (as we explain below), section 507(b) of the Copyright Act barred Cambridge's claims based on the Romanowicz assignment before this suit was filed in 2000.</p>\n<p>2. <i>The Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic Assignment</i></p>\n<p>On the undisputed facts, Dr. Alexandrine Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic, Margarete Seemann's heir in Belgrade, knewor reasonably should have known about the basis for a claim of co-ownership of the United States copyright to <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> before February 1997. In making this determination, we do not decide whether Seemann co-authored the book, whether Goebel's figurines were derivatives of the book, or whether any rights that descended from Seemann to the heirs entitled the heirs to share in profits derived from sales of the figurines. The accrual test looks to the existence of a claim, not its resolution.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> Herrmann first contacted Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic's attorney in Vienna, Dr. Theodor Petter, in 1995. Petter referred Herrmann directly to Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic to discuss an assignment of copyrights. Herrmann testified that in a conversation that same year, Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic indicated that \"she was very interested in gaining some income based upon an assignment of her American rights. . . .\" She referred Herrmann back to Petter, and the two attorneys commenced negotiations.<sup>[10]</sup> At that time, Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic knew she was not receiving any payments on any inherited co-author ownership right in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> She also was aware that Fink had not paid her royalties on the original German book, in contrast with Fink's payment until 1973 to the heirs of royalties on an English-language <i>The Hummel Book.</i><sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Starting at the latest in 1995, when she was contacted by Herrmann, Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic had every motivation to ascertain the existence and potential value of her rights in the book, and she had counsel in Vienna to assist her in that task. Yet she did not bring suit within three years, even though readily available inquiries would have revealed numerous repudiations of the \"rights\" Cambridge sought to purchase.</p>\n<p>There were a number of different signs of repudiation, which in total require the conclusion that the claims had accrued. Publicly available documents in the United States Copyright Office raised issues about Seemann's purported ownership of <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> First, the original 1936 application for a United States copyright in the book lists the publishing house Emil Fink Verlag as the \"copyright owner.\" Second, the 1962 application for the renewal copyright lists the publisher as \"proprietor of copyright in a work made for hire.\" Third, a 1971 transfer document, recorded in accordance with 17 U.S.C. § 205, expressly names Fink as owner of the copyright and describes an assignment of the copyright to Goebel. Fourth, due diligence, including questions to Cambridge, may well have led to information about the litigation which resulted in the 1992 Consent Decree. There is another point as well. Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic openly expressed to Herrmann when he telephoned her in 1995 that she was interested in obtaining income from whatever rights she might hold.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, if Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic indeed possessed a joint interest in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> book's United States copyright as an heir to Seemann, then she would have been entitled to the exclusive right \"to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(2). Goebel, meanwhile, had been \"openly[] and quite notoriously\" exploiting works for decades that appeared in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i><sup>[12]</sup><i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 228. At least one of Goebel's much-used and apparently profitable images appears in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> Cambridge's complaint points out that Goebel has \"for decades utilized, in a particular and crucial fashion, one specific picture . . . popularly known as `The Merry Wanderer,'\" which \"`ultimately became the <i>symbol</i> for the entire M.I. Hummel line.'\" Yet Goebel never paid the heirs for its use of The Merry Wanderer.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>The sum, by 1995, of all of this was to start the limitations period running. Publicly available documents in the Copyright Office and prior litigation cast doubt on Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic's rights in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> Moreover, Goebel engaged in widespread exploitation of at least some portion of those rights, such as its use of The Merry Wanderer, without remuneration to Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic. Such circumstances constituted a \"plain and express repudiation\" of Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic's purported co-ownership rights in <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> sufficient to trigger the Copyright Act's three-year statute of limitations. <i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 228 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>Whether Seemann co-authored <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> or not, the right to contest that status lay with the poet's heirs until they assigned them to Cambridge. Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic did not file suit by 1998. Cambridge did not resurrect that claim by purchasing an assignment from Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic in 1999. \"[A]n assignee cannot maintain a claim in the face of a limitations defense that would have trumped the same claim had it been brought by the assignor.\" <i>Young,</i> 305 F.3d at 17.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Tolling</i></p>\n<p>Cambridge argues that a \"legal disability\" tolled the statute of limitations against its claims based on the assignment from Romanowicz in 1995. Cambridge could not have filed this case until 1999, it claims, because \"until then the sole basis for alleging Goebel's exploitation was documents classified as `SECRET' by a federal court in another earlier matter-the content of which [Herrmann] was duty bound not to disclose.\"</p>\n<p>Cambridge's position, even taken on its own terms, is baseless. Just as all the reasons we have outlined would have put Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic on notice of a repudiation of Seemann's status as co-author, those reasons provided more than adequate grounds for Cambridge to allege that Goebel had prepared works derivative of the book. Cambridge need not have relied on any documents under protective order to file this lawsuit. There was no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> tolling of Cambridge's claims based on the Romanowicz assignment.</p>\n<p>We affirm summary judgment in favor of defendants. Costs are awarded to defendants.</p>\n<p>CYR, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The majority opinion holds that since the Cambridge state-law accounting claim might require it to establish as a threshold matter that its predecessor-in-interest, Margarete Seemann, was an original co-owner of the copyright in Das Hummelbuch, the Cambridge claim thus \"arises under\" the Copyright Act for purposes of both subject matter jurisdiction and, by logical extension, the Act's three-year statute of limitations. Inasmuch as the ramifications of this holding<i>viz.,</i> that the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate all accounting claims between the co-owners of a copyrighted work, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a)-are both unprecedented and potentially pernicious, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The majority relies principally on decisions such as <i>De Sylva v. Ballentine,</i> 351 U.S. 570, 76 S.Ct. 974, 100 L.Ed. 1415 (1956), for the proposition that any state-law cause of action which potentially involves a threshold determination of the plaintiff's copyright ownership must be said to \"arise under\" the Copyright Act (<i>viz.,</i> a <i>de facto</i> federal cause of action), and thus is governed by the Act and subject to its three-year statute of limitations, thereby rendering any discrete inquiry into the scope of the Act's preemptive effect immaterial. However, <i>De Sylva</i> was a non-diversity case in which the plaintiff expressly filed a claim pursuant to the Copyright Act, demanding a <i>declaratory judgment</i> that she was a co-owner of a copyrighted work, and consequently the Court assumed that the Copyright Act's substantive definitions concerning copyright ownership governed any decision on the merits of the plaintiff's federal-law claim. <i>See id.</i> at 975.<sup>[14]</sup> To establish subject matter jurisdiction, a declaratory judgment plaintiff normally must demonstrate more than its desire to settle its rights under federal law, but must show \"a real and reasonable apprehension\" that the defendant plans to sue to establish that the plaintiff is not so entitled, <i>viz.,</i> that Goebel planned to litigate a dispute as to whether the Cambridge chain of title originated with a person who was a \"co-owner\" of the copyright as defined by the Copyright Act of 1909. <i>See generally,</i> 3-12 Melville B. Nimmer &amp; David Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 12.01 (2005) (noting that \"the [federal] Declaratory Judgment Act [28 U.S.C. § 2201(a)] does not, of its own force, confer subject matter jurisdiction on the federal courts\"; \"[o]nce an action for declaratory relief is instituted, the defendant can attempt to negate the element of reasonable apprehension of litigation by entering a binding covenant not to sue.\"). When the plaintiff himself pleads a claim for declaratory judgment, the ownership of the Copyright Act title is not merely a <i>potential</i> focus of dispute, it is the only issue relevant to an adjudication of the declaratory action.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> In stark contrast, Cambridge filed no federal-law claim for a declaration of copyright ownership under the Copyright Act, but merely a claim in equity for an accounting between tenants in common of property, which is premised entirely on state-created common law. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Arsenault v. Arsenault,</i> 337 Mass. 189, 148 N.E.2d 662, 663 (1958); <i>see also Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 6.12 (noting that a joint owner of a copyrighted work is under an equitable duty to account to other joint owners for a rateable share of the profits realized from his use of the work). For jurisdictional purposes, the plaintiff normally is the \"master\" of his complaint, and if he pleads a claim purely based in state law, the claim cannot be deemed to have \"arise[n] under\" federal law, even if it is anticipated that the defendant's answer will deny the plaintiff's factual allegations or will raise federal-law defenses to that state-law claim. <i>See </i><i>Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys., Inc.,</i> 535 U.S. 826, 831, 122 S.Ct. 1889, 153 L.Ed.2d 13 (2002) (\"[S]ince the plaintiff is `the master of the complaint,' the well-pleaded-complaint rule enables him, `by eschewing claims based on federal law, . . . to have the cause heard in state court.'\") (citation omitted); <i>Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams,</i> 482 U.S. 386, 392, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987) (noting that plaintiff properly \"may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law\"); <i>Ten Taxpayer Citizens Group v. Cape Wind Assocs., LLC,</i> 373 F.3d 183, 191 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that the well-pleaded complaint rule applies \"even where the asserted defense is the preemptive effect of a federal statute\"). On its face, the Cambridge complaint neither invokes nor calls for the interpretation of any federal law. <i>See </i><i>Cambridge Literary Props., Ltd. v. W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. &amp; Co. Kg.,</i> 295 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir.2002) (observing, in dictum, that \"[it] is unlikely that any federal cause of action is asserted, even though federal law is the source of the Hummel Book itself\"); <i>see also </i><i>Goodman v. Lee,</i> 78 F.3d 1007, 1012 (5th Cir. 1996) (noting that an accounting claim between joint owners of copyright \"is governed in all respects by state law\"); <i>Iza Music Corp. v. W &amp; K Music Corp.,</i> 995 F.Supp. 417, 418 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (finding that a state-law accounting claim, in which plaintiff did not seek a declaration of joint ownership under the Copyright Act, did not \"arise under\" the Act, distinguishing cases like <i>Merchant v. Levy,</i> 92 F.3d 51, 55 (2d Cir.1996), because they \"focus[ed] solely on the claim for a declaration of joint ownership\"); <i>accord </i><i>Keith v. Scruggs,</i> 507 F.Supp. 968, 970 (S.D.N.Y.1981) (finding no federal jurisdiction where denial of the plaintiff's ownership rights under the Copyright Act was merely a potential defense to complaint). Accordingly, <i>De Sylva</i> is legally and factually inapposite.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In cases where the complaint articulates a claim exclusively in terms of state law, there are only two narrow exceptions to the well-pleaded complaint rule. Such a claim might be considered to \"arise under\" federal law for jurisdictional purposes if: (i) an adjudication of the state-law claim necessarily will involve the determination of a \"substantial federal question,\" <i>see </i><i>Almond v. Capital Props., Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir.2000); or (ii) a federal statute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> (<i>e.g.,</i> the Copyright Act) can be said to exert such a pervasive and overpowering preemptive force that all state-law claims of the type pleaded are \"completely preempted,\" <i>see </i><i>Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust,</i> 463 U.S. 1, 22, 24, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983) (noting that plaintiff cannot, by \"artful pleading,\" escape complete preemption); <i>SPGGC, LLC v. Ayotte,</i> 488 F.3d 525, 530 n. 4 (1st Cir.2007) (noting that complete preemption \"converts the state claim into a federal claim\"). In my view, the Cambridge accounting claim satisfies neither exception.</p>\n<p>A. <i>\"Substantial Federal Question\" (\"SFQ\") Jurisdiction</i></p>\n<p>Goebel suggests that, even though the Cambridge accounting claim makes no mention of the Copyright Act, it \"arises under\" the Act in that Cambridge obviously would not be entitled to a state-law accounting if it were not a co-owner of the Das Hummelbuch copyright, a status which in turn depends, <i>inter alia,</i> on Cambridge establishing that Margarete Seemann originally fit the co-ownership definitions of the Act. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 101 (noting that \"joint work\" is \"a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole\"); <i>id.</i> § 201(a) (\"The authors of a joint work are co-owners of copyright in the work.\").<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Admittedly, \"[d]etermining precisely which [state-law] actions `arise under' copyright law, and therefore fall within exclusive federal jurisdiction, `poses among the knottiest procedural problems in copyright jurisprudence.'\" <i>Gener-Villar v. Adcom Group, Inc.,</i> 417 F.3d 201, 203 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 12.01[A]). Nonetheless, since the \"federal courts are courts of <i>limited jurisdiction,</i> . . . [they] must `monitor their jurisdictional boundaries vigilantly.'\" <i>Diaz-Rodriguez v. Pep Boys Corp.,</i> 410 F.3d 56, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> 62 n. 5 (1st Cir.2005) (emphasis added; citation omitted). The \"controversial\" SFQ exception thus \"endures in principle but should be applied with caution and various qualifications.\" <i>Rossello-Gonzalez v. Calderon-Serra,</i> 398 F.3d 1, 11-12 (1st Cir.2004) (\"Federal ingredient jurisdiction remains `controversial,' because `[t]he Supreme Court has periodically affirmed this basis for jurisdiction in the abstract . . ., occasionally cast doubt upon it, rarely applied it in practice, and left the very scope of the concept unclear.'\")(quoting <i>Almond,</i> 212 F.3d at 23); <i>see </i><i>Metheny v. Becker,</i> 352 F.3d 458, 460 (1st Cir.2003).<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>Such special caution is necessary in the instant case because if the SFQ exception were found to have been satisfied merely because the Goebel answer <i>might</i> deny and dispute the plaintiff's copyright co-ownership as a \"defense\" to the Cambridge state-law accounting claim, <i>see supra</i> note 16, then <i>all</i> state-law accounting claims between copyright co-owners must \"arise under\" the Copyright Act, even where there is no genuine factual dispute under 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 and 201(a) regarding the provenance of the plaintiff's title. In the vast majority of accounting cases, the parties are likely to stipulate the plaintiff's co-ownership under these Copyright Act definitions, hence state-law issues will predominate the adjudication of the accounting claim. Since the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction to decide Copyright Act cases, however, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a), all such claims would be removable as of right from state to federal court, thus effecting a significant expansion of our \"federal question\" jurisdiction.<sup>[18]</sup> More importantly, the SFQ exception neither permits nor requires such a dramatic expansion of our limited jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>1. <i>The SFQ Jurisdictional Test</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng'g &amp; Mfg.,</i> 545 U.S. 308, 312-14, 125 S.Ct. 2363, 162 L.Ed.2d 257 (2005), the Supreme Court recently elaborated on the inherent limitations of the SFQ exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule, which it originally pronounced more broadly in <i>Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 255 U.S. 180, 41 S.Ct. 243, 65 L.Ed. 577 (1921).<sup>[19]</sup> \"[T]he mere need to apply federal law in a state-law claim will [not] suffice to open the `arising under' door. . . . [T]his Court [has] confined [it] to those [state-law claims] that `<i>really</i> and substantially <span class=\"star-pagination\">*96</span> involv[e] a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction or effect of [federal] law.'\" <i>Grable,</i> 545 U.S. at 313, 125 S.Ct. 2363 (noting that the SFQ exception \"demands not only a <i>contested</i> federal issue, but a <i>substantial</i> one, indicating a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum\") (emphasis added; citation omitted); <i>see </i><i>Merrell Dow Pharm. v. Thompson,</i> 478 U.S. 804, 813, 106 S.Ct. 3229, 92 L.Ed.2d 650 (1986) (\"[T]he mere presence of a federal issue in a state cause of action does not automatically confer federal-question jurisdiction.\"); <i>Dunlap v. G &amp; L Holding Group, Inc.,</i> 381 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2004). In other words, \"the question is, does a state-law claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue, <i>actually disputed</i> and <i>substantial,</i> which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.\" <i>Grable,</i> 545 U.S. at 314, 125 S.Ct. 2363 (emphasis added). The Court admonished that the federal courts should invoke the SFQ exception only if it is \"consistent with congressional judgment about the sound division of labor between state and federal courts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 313-14, 125 S.Ct. 2363. Further, \"the presence of a disputed federal issue and the ostensible importance of a federal forum are never necessarily dispositive; there must always be an assessment of any disruptive portent in exercising federal jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 314.</p>\n<p>The <i>Grable</i> Court found the SFQ exception satisfied because the plaintiff's state-law complaint, which sought to quiet title to property which the Internal Revenue Service seized and sold at auction to a third party, depended <i>entirely</i> on a dispute about the adequacy of the IRS's compliance with seizure notification procedures set forth in the federal tax code, <i>see</i> 26 U.S.C. § 6335. <i>Grable,</i> 545 U.S. at 315, 125 S.Ct. 2363 (\"Whether Grable was given [adequate] notice within the meaning of the federal statute is thus an essential element of its quiet title claim, and the meaning of the federal statute is <i>actually in dispute;</i> it appears to be the only legal and factual dispute.\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p><i>Grable</i> thus requires us to undertake two inquiries: whether (i) the Cambridge state-law complaint, on its face, and without reference to any possible defenses, \"necessarily\" discloses an \"actual\" and \"substantial\" dispute concerning the interpretation of the Copyright Act; and (ii) invocation of the SFQ exception would be consistent with any congressional policy in enacting the Copyright Act as to the proper balancing of jurisdiction between the federal and state courts.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> 2. <i>The \"Actual\" and \"Substantial\" Dispute Criterion</i></p>\n<p>Like the plaintiff's complaint in <i>De Sylva,</i> 351 U.S. 570, 76 S.Ct. 974, 100 L.Ed. 1415, <i>supra,</i> the Grable complaint<i>on its face</i>placed the meaning of a federal statute in active dispute. If the <i>Grable</i> defendant eventually did not challenge the plaintiff's interpretation of the federal seizure-notification statute, it necessarily would lose the lawsuit, because it would thereby concede its violation of its fiduciary duty under state corporation law. Thus, it was reasonable to anticipate, from the complaint itself, that the federal constitutional issue was substantial and that it would have to be adjudicated.</p>\n<p>By contrast, although the Cambridge complaint may depend in the abstract on Seemann's original copyright co-ownership, that fact alone is insufficient to satisfy <i>Grable</i>'s heightened \"active dispute\" test. The ultimate success of the Cambridge complaint may depend on an actual adjudication of any number of issues, federal and non-federal, which are not yet apparent at the pleading stage. <i>See </i><i>Royal v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc.,</i> 833 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1987) (finding no jurisdiction, even though, if plaintiff succeeded in obtaining contract rescission, the court would need to apply 17 U.S.C. § 201(b) to defeat his claim; \"[t]he work-made-for-hire doctrine is, at best, only tangentially implicated [and][i]ndeed, it is not even mentioned in the complaint\"); <i>see also </i><i>Cambridge Literary,</i> 295 F.3d at 64 n. 4 (\"It is possible to imagine a Massachusetts court looking to federal copyright law and German contract law as to whether Hummel, Seemann, and Fink are co-owners; Austrian inheritance law if the Seemann rights are disputed; federal copyright law as to whether the figurines are derivative works; and to the law of any of several jurisdictions as to rights and defenses among co-owners and available remedies.\"); <i>Derminer v. Kramer,</i> 386 F.Supp.2d 905, 912 (E.D.Mich.2005). For example, Goebel itself notes that, if Goebel denies the allegation, Cambridge eventually may need to prove as well that the Hummel figurines were \"derivative works\" from the illustrations contained in Das Hummelbuch, <i>see</i> 17 U.S.C. § 101, and failure to establish that fact might prove equally dispositive and fatal to the accounting claim. <i>Grable</i> makes clear, however, that the mere presence of these potential federal issues is insufficient to create SFQ jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Unlike the plaintiff in <i>De Sylva,</i> who expressly included in his complaint a request for a declaration of his co-ownership rights in the copyright, the Cambridge complaint does not place its co-ownership of the copyright in \"active dispute.\" Such an active dispute would arise, if at all, at the time Goebel files its answer to the complaint, <i>see supra</i> note 16, and pursuant to the well-pleaded complaint rule, this is insufficient to invoke SFQ jurisdiction. Further, it simply is not the case that Goebel necessarily will forfeit its chances of winning the case if it chooses not to contest the Cambridge co-ownership interests. If Goebel stipulates to the Cambridge co-ownership rights under 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 and 201(a), it will have done no more than concede Cambridge's standing to bring suit under state law.</p>\n<p>3. <i>The \"Congressional Intent\" Requirement</i></p>\n<p>Application of the SFQ exception to this type of accounting claim between copyright co-owners also would serve no apparent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> congressional policy concerning the proper allocation of jurisdictional labor between the federal and state courts in cases which happen to involve copyrighted material. <i>See </i><i>Templeton Bd. of Sewer Comm'rs v. Am. Tissue Mills of Mass., Inc.,</i> 352 F.3d 33, 40-41 (1st Cir.2003) (\"We do not believe that merely because a court will have to interpret the federal regulations, it necessarily follows that federal jurisdiction exists. . . . `[T]he determination of whether a federal issue is sufficiently substantial should be informed by a sensitive judgment about whether the existence of federal judicial power is both appropriate and pragmatic,' and . . . `at bottom, we must determine whether the dispute is one that Congress intended federal courts to resolve.'\") (citations omitted); <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 12.01.</p>\n<p>The Copyright Act and its preemption provision expressly apply to acts of copyright <i>infringement, viz.,</i> the unauthorized use and exploitation of copyrighted materials by a person who neither <i>owns</i> the copyright nor has a valid license. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 301(a) (preempting only those \"legal and equitable rights that are <i>equivalent to</i> any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright <i>as specified in § 106</i>\") (emphasis added); <i>id.</i> § 106 (providing that \"the owner of copyright under this title has the <i>exclusive</i> rights to do and to authorize any of the following [acts].\") (emphasis added). By definition, however, a co-owner who profits from the copyright cannot \"infringe\" or make \"unauthorized use\" of the copyright, as that concept is defined in 17 U.S.C. § 106. <i>See </i><i>Weissmann v. Freeman,</i> 868 F.2d 1313, 1318 (2nd Cir.1989) (\"[A]n action for infringement between joint owners will not lie because an individual cannot infringe his own copyright\"); <i>Quintanilla v. Tex. Television, Inc.,</i> 3 F.Supp.2d 747, 753 (S.D.Tex.1997), <i>aff'd,</i> 139 F.3d 494 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>Instead, the Copyright Act, which sets forth express remedies available to copyright owners against infringers, deliberately omits any comparable express or implied remedy for a co-owner seeking an accounting from a joint copyright owner who has profited from use of the copyright. The Act's legislative history unambiguously explains the reason for this omission: \"[t]here is . . . no need for a specific statutory provision concerning [the] rights and duties of the coowners of a work; court-made law on this point is left undisturbed.\" H.R.Rep. No. 94-1676, at 121, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5736. To the extent that this residual court-made law involves the common-law rights of tenants in common, the primary source always has been state (and not federal) law, and the Copyright Act contains no hint that Congress intended to usurp the state courts' traditional jurisdiction to adjudicate these types of claims. <i>See Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 6.10; <i>Goodman,</i> 78 F.3d at 1012 (\"The applicability of federal law ends with that determination [of non-preemption], as Goodman's claim for an accounting is governed in all respects by state law. It is widely recognized that `[a] co-owner of a copyright must account to other co-owners for any profits he earns from the licensing or use of the copyright. . . .' Significantly, `the duty to account does not derive from the copyright law's proscription of infringement. Rather, it comes from \". . . general principles of law governing the rights of co-owners.\"' As those general principles are rooted in state law, we look to the law of Louisiana for answers to the remaining issues presented by this appeal.\") (citations omitted); <i>Oddo v. Ries,</i> 743 F.2d 630, 633 n. 2 (9th Cir.1984) (same, concluding that \"a suit to bring the co-owner of a copyright to account does not fall within the district court's jurisdiction over actions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> arising under [§ 1338]\"); <i>Dead Kennedys v. Biafra,</i> 37 F.Supp.2d 1151, 1153 (N.D.Cal.1999).</p>\n<p>In a case where the federal law at issue does not contain any comparable remedy (or at least a partial remedy), one reasonably cannot surmise that Congress saw the asserted federal interest as \"substantial,\" and thus invocation of SFQ jurisdiction is simply inappropriate. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Merrell Dow,</i> 478 U.S. at 817, 106 S.Ct. 3229 (\"[A] [state-law negligence] complaint [against a drug manufacturer] alleging a violation of a federal statute [<i>viz.,</i> a federal statute banning misbranding of prescription drugs] as an element of a state cause of action, when Congress has determined that there should be no private, federal cause of action for the violation, does not state a claim `arising under' § 1331.\").<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>Because Cambridge's state-law accounting meets neither of the two SFQ jurisdictional criteria elaborated in <i>Grable,</i> it cannot be said to \"arise under\" the Copyright Act.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Complete Preemption</i></p>\n<p>Similarly, the complete preemption doctrine does not permit us to disregard the well-pleaded complaint rule and recharacterizeas mere \"artful pleading\"the Cambridge state-law accounting claim as a federal-law claim \"arising under\" the Copyright Act.<sup>[22]</sup> The Act plainly does not exert such an overpowering preemptive force as to bring under the federal courts' subject matter jurisdiction all state-law causes of action between co-owners of a copyrighted work. <i>See </i><i>Caterpillar,</i> 482 U.S. at 393, 107 S.Ct. 2425 (observing that federal statute's preemptive effect must be <i>\"extraordinary\"</i> to trigger complete preemption); <i>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor,</i> 481 U.S. 58, 64, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987). Federal courts, as courts of limited jurisdiction, should implement federal preemption doctrines as narrowly as possible. <i>See </i><i>Lontz v. Tharp,</i> 413 F.3d 435, 440 (4th Cir.2005) (noting that there is a rebuttable presumption against finding complete preemption, so that \"[d]efendants' burden is to demonstrate that a federal statute indisputably displaces any state cause of action over a given subject matter\") (citation omitted); <i>see also</i> Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Edward H. Cooper, 14B <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction 3d</i> § 3722.1, at 517 (\"Because of the obvious federalism implications of the complete preemption doctrine, its application has been extremely limited by the courts.\"). Complete preemption analysis thus depends on the existence of palpable evidence that Congress intended to displace completely a particular category of state-law causes of action, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> as manifested by the federal statute's language, overall structure, and legislative history. <i>See </i><i>Metro. Life,</i> 481 U.S. at 65, 107 S.Ct. 1542; <i>Magee v. Exxon Corp.,</i> 135 F.3d 599, 601-02 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>Unlike the few federal statutes which have been found to effect complete preemption (<i>e.g.,</i> the governance of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) over all plan\"related\" causes of action, <i>see </i><i>Metro. Life,</i> 481 U.S. at 67, 107 S.Ct. 1542; <i>Hotz v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Mass., Inc.,</i> 292 F.3d 57, 59 (1st Cir.2002)), the Copyright Act does not encompass all claims simply because the parties' dispute happens to involve a copyrighted work. <i>See </i><i>Venegas-Hernandez v. Asociacion De Compositores Editores De Musica Latinoamericana,</i> 424 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir.2005) (\"The Copyright Act does not draw into federal court all matters that pertain to copyright.\"); <i>Royal,</i> 833 F.2d at 2. Further, although the Copyright Act (unlike ERISA, for example) gives the federal courts exclusive (rather than concurrent) jurisdiction over any claims which arise under the Act, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a), this jurisdictional canon necessarily presupposes an antecedent inquiry as to whether a particular state-law cause of action involving a copyrighted work can be said to \"arise under\" the Act in the first instance.</p>\n<p>Unlike ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a) (providing that ERISA \"shall supersede <i>any and all</i> State laws\" to the extent that those laws \"<i>relate to</i> any employee benefit plan\") (emphasis added), the Copyright Act's preemption provisions are not even remotely panoptic. The Copyright Act preempts only those \"legal and equitable rights that are <i>equivalent to</i> any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright <i>as specified in § 106.</i>\" 17 U.S.C. § 301(a) (emphasis added). Further, \"[n]othing in [the Act] annuls or limits any <i>rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any State</i> with respect to . . . activities violating legal or equitable rights that are not the equivalent to any of the <i>exclusive</i> rights within the general scope of copyright as specified in section 106A with respect to works of visual art.\" <i>Id.</i> § 301(b)(3) (emphasis added); <i>see </i><i>BLAB T.V. of Mobile, Inc. v. Comcast Cable Commc'ns, Inc.,</i> 182 F.3d 851, 857 (11th Cir.1999) (finding no complete preemption because the federal Cable Act contained language which \"preserv[ed] state authority except in areas in which the exercise of this authority would be inconsistent with federal law\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Metro.

Many of the same factors that preclude our finding that the Copyright Act completely preempts the Cambridge state-law accounting claim likewise would militate against any finding for Goebel at summary judgment on its preemption defense. <i>See Fifth Third Bank,</i> 415 F.3d at 745 (noting that preemption is an affirmative offense upon which defendant bears the burden of proof); <i>see also </i><i>Brown v. Earthboard Sports USA,</i> 481 F.3d 901, 913 (6th Cir.2007). With respect to the preemption of state-law causes of action involving copyrighted works, we have applied the two-pronged \"subject matter\"/\"extra-element\" test, <i>Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp.,</i> 36 F.3d 1147, 1164-65 (1st Cir.1994) (finding no Copyright Act preemption of state-law claim for trade secrets misappropriation because latter involved \"extra element\" <i>viz.,</i> breach of a fiduciary dutynot found in a copyright infringement claim); <i>see also </i><i>Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software Servs., Inc. v. Grace Consulting, Inc.,</i> 307 F.3d 197, 217-19 (3d Cir.2002); <i>Computer Mgmt. Assistance Co. v. Robert F. DeCastro, Inc.,</i> 220 F.3d 396, 404-05 (5th Cir. 2000), and again inquire whether the particular state law at issue is the functional equivalent of a federal copyright infringement action, or instead is qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 301(a) (\"preempting state causes of action which are premised on rights \"equivalent to\" copyright-holder's exclusive rights of use set forth in § 106\"); <i>Stromback v. New Line Cinema,</i> 384 F.3d 283, 301 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Under the <i>Data General</i> test, the state-law accounting claim between co-owners of a copyrighted work, which sounds neither in contract nor tort, but in equitable principles of trust as between joint property owners, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Bacon v. Bacon,</i> 165 N.E. 485 (1929) (describing co-owner relationship as fiduciary in nature); <i>supra</i> note 25, is not preempted because it is not the qualitative equivalent of a copyright infringement claim under the Copyright Act. Further, the Cambridge state-law accounting claim requires an extra element not found in a copyright infringement case: an existing equitable trust relationship between the parties. In <i>Data General,</i> the relationship was fiduciary; here, the relationship is joint ownership of property giving rise to an equitable duty to provide an accounting of profits. The Copyright Act does not preempt the state-law accounting claim, and thus it cannot be dismissed on preemption grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>CONCLUSION</i></h2>\n<p>In order to bring the Cambridge state-law cause of action under the Copyright Act's three-year limitations provision, the majority announces a blanket jurisdictional rule which threatens to draw into the federal courts many copyright-related claims over which Congress deliberately intended to give the state courts concurrent jurisdiction. As the state courts are perfectly competent to interpret Copyright Act definitions that may be tangentially relevant to their disposition of state-law causes of action, the mere possibility that they may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> need to consult those statutory definitions should not convert claims which essentially arise under state law into federal claims, particularly where the corresponding federal statute has eschewed comparable remedies. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Not all claims of co-ownership will arise under the Copyright Act, and our decision does not affect such cases. For example, at times, whether there is co-ownership may be determined by the terms of a contract governed by state law or through other ownership interests governed by state law and thus not require application of the Copyright Act. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Royal v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc.,</i> 833 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1987) (rejecting federal question jurisdiction where claim of co-ownership, \"in its very nature and essence, [was] one for breach of contract\" under state law). In other cases, such as where co-ownership results from purported statutory co-authorship, the question of co-ownership is governed by the Copyright Act. <i>See</i> 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 12.01[A][1][b] (2007) (endorsing view that in an action seeking declaratory judgment of plaintiff as co-author and for an accounting, federal jurisdiction is exclusive because \"copyright ownership by reason of one's status as co-author arises directly from the terms of the Copyright Act itself\"); <i>see also </i><i>Gaiman v. McFarlane,</i> 360 F.3d 644, 652-53 (7th Cir. 2004) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>[2]  We do not hold, nor is it a ramification of our holding, that federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate all accounting claims between the co-owners of a copyrighted work.</p>\n<p>[3]  The complaint states that the District of Massachusetts \"has diversity jurisdiction . . . pursuant to [28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)]\" and \"[f]urther, if this action were determined to be arising under Federal copyright statutes, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1338.\" Am. Compl. ¶¶ 16-17.</p>\n<p>[4]  At the same time, however, the complaint concedes that Goebel and other parties had previously asserted the ownership rights to the United States copyright in <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> without ever acknowledging any ownership interest by Seemann or her heirs. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Am. Compl. ¶¶ 44-45 (\"Goebel, claiming as alleged owner of the Book Renewal . . . has previously, in a United States District Court, made claim for alleged infringement of the Book Renewal.\"); <i>id.</i> ¶ 66 (alleging that a 1992 federal court consent decree named Schmid and a Goebel subsidiary \"undivided joint owners of the Book Renewal\"). Similarly, the complaint reveals that Goebel had previously represented the contents of the book as \"works for hire\" rather than \"joint works,\" which would mean that even if Seemann held the copyright in her poems, her rights would not extend to Hummel's illustrations. Am. Compl. ¶ 44.</p>\n<p>[5]  At no time has Cambridge alleged that Goebel exploited Seemann's written contributions to <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i></p>\n<p>[6]  Nothing in our decision in <i>Royal</i> is inconsistent, contrary to Cambridge's argument. In <i>Royal,</i> we upheld dismissal of a claim for declaration of copyright ownership because that claim did not create federal question jurisdiction. 833 F.2d at 2. Here, jurisdiction is not at issue. In addition, the <i>Royal</i> claimant's theory of ownership turned not on his status as a co-author, but on an alleged breach of a royalty agreement between the claimant and his employer. <i>Id.</i> at 1-3. Because \"[the claimant's] assertions gr[e]w out of his purported contract rights,\" state law controlled their resolution and failed to create federal subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n<p>[7]  Our holding is that the federal period of limitations, and not a state limitations period, applies to the predicate question of co-authorship rights, which is governed by the Copyright Act. We see no need to address the defense of preemption raised by Goebel, <i>see</i> 17 U.S.C. § 301, or Cambridge's argument that there is no preemption. In particular, Cambridge argues that a grandfathering provision saves the accounting claim from preemption because it involves \"undertakings commenced before January 1, 1978,\" i.e., Goebel's exploitation of Hummel imagery from 1935 to the present. <i>Id.</i> § 301(b)(2). Our holding rests on the fact that the issue of ownership must be addressed first and is controlled by the Copyright Act's limitations period. This is true whether or not the claim for an accounting under state law is preempted.</p>\n<p>[8]  If Cambridge is arguing that the grandfathering clause in section 301(b)(2) somehow makes the co-authorship issue not an issue of federal law under the Act, then Cambridge is wrong. By its own terms, section 301(b) is limited in its application only to \"rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any State.\" <i>Id.</i> § 301(b). Pre-1978 claims of co-author status are governed by the Copyright Act of 1909. <i>Cf. </i><i>De Sylva,</i> 351 U.S. at 580, 76 S.Ct. 974.</p>\n<p>[9]  The question of whether a claim for an accounting for profits realized from exploitation of a jointly-owned copyright-once that ownership is established-is subject to state-law limitations is not one that we need decide. <i>See supra</i> note 7.</p>\n<p>[10]  Petter died soon thereafter. In 1996, Petter's daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Fetcher-Petter, took over her father's law practice and resumed negotiations with Herrmann. Fetcher-Petter described those negotiations as \"productive but extremely lengthy\"; the assignment from Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic to Cambridge was finally executed on February 9, 1999.</p>\n<p>[11]  A stipulation between the parties indicates that Fink paid book royalties to the heirs until 1973. Cambridge argues that \"[t]hese payments constituted an <i>affirmation</i> of [Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic's] interests [in the book] both by Fink and [Goebel]. . . .\" Cambridge's argument fails. The stipulation states that Fink paid royalties to Seemann and her heirs for sales of <i>The Hummel Book,</i> the English translation of <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> The 1934 contract between Fink and Seemann treated these as two separate properties. Fink was to pay Seemann three lump sums in 1934 for the use of her poems in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> Fink could, according to the contract, prepare translations of the German book only by mutual agreement with Seemann, and the poet would receive a 4% royalty on the retail price of any translated books. As a translation, <i>The Hummel Book</i> itself is a derivative work, the ownership of which \"does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material.\" 17 U.S.C. §§ 101, 103. Any rights in a translation of <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> would therefore not extend to any of the images contained in the original German edition.</p>\n<p>[12]  Goebel does not argue that the mere manufacturing and marketing of Hummel figurines put the heirs on notice, regardless of the heirs' knowledge of the source for the figurines.</p>\n<p>[13]  Cambridge argues that the apparent repudiation of any rights held by Seemann in The Merry Wanderer and other images from <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> was insufficient because Seemann's heirs could not possibly have known for certain that Goebel was exploiting derivatives of the book. Cambridge maintains this is so because Goebel, if asked, would have denied that it was exploiting derivative works. The heirs, as with any other rights-holder with a potential claim, need not have obtained an admission of liability from Goebel in order for accrual to occur.</p>\n<p>[14]  The Cambridge complaint sufficiently invoked the district court's diversity jurisdiction, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1332, and thus does not depend on the existence <i>vel non</i> of federal-question jurisdiction. The jurisdictional analysis is relevant only to the question whether the claim is \"maintained\" under the Copy-right Act, <i>see infra</i> note 21, and thus subject to its three-year statute of limitations, rather than the applicable state-law limitations period.</p>\n<p>[15]  All the other cases cited by the majority are cut from this same cloth, and involve a straightforward holding that a claim which the plaintiff expressly denominates as a federal-law claim obviously must be said to \"arise under\" the federal statute that it invokes. <i>See </i><i>Santa-Rosa v. Combo Records,</i> 471 F.3d 224, 227-28 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2265, 167 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2007); <i>Gaiman v. McFarlane,</i> 360 F.3d 644, 652 (7th Cir.2004); <i>Merchant v. Levy,</i> 92 F.3d 51, 55 (2d Cir.1996); <i>Goodman v. Lee,</i> 78 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>[16]  Oddly enough, given the fact that the case has proceeded to the summary judgment stage, Goebel has yet to file an answer to the Cambridge complaint, <i>see </i><i>Wolf v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.,</i> 71 F.3d 444, 449 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that affirmative defenses normally are waived if not filed in initial responsive pleadings), has yet to deny the Cambridge allegation that Cambridge is a valid copyright co-owner (<i>via</i> descent and contract) of Seemann's original title, and has not produced a Rule 56 evidentiary proffer which would call the Seemann joint ownership into doubt. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, 120, 121 (1976), <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5736 (noting that co-ownership inquiry must focus on \"the intention at the time the writing is done that the parts be absorbed or combined into an integrated unit\"); <i>Thomson v. Larson,</i> 147 F.3d 195, 199 (2d Cir.1998). Rather, Goebel simply maintains on appeal that the mere possibility of such a factual dispute satisfies the SFQ exception to the well-pleaded complaint. Goebel would face three considerable hurdles, however, if it were to pursue such a denial: (i) Das Hummelbuch, on its face, appears to be a unitary and fully integrated creation of artwork and poetry, <i>viz.,</i> a \"joint work\" as defined by § 101 and § 201(a), <i>see </i><i>Lulirama Ltd., Inc. v. Axcess Broad. Servs., Inc.,</i> 128 F.3d 872, 877 (5th Cir.1997) (noting that the contribution of an independent contractor will not be deemed a \"work for hire\" unless it fits into \"one of the nine narrowly drawn categories of works\"); (ii) Seemann's listing as an author on the certificate of registration creates a rebuttable presumption of her joint authorship and ownership, <i>see </i><i>Brown v. Latin Am. Music Co.,</i> 498 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir.2007) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 410(c) (\"In any judicial proceedings the certificate of a registration made before or within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate.\")); and (iii) any rebuttal of this presumption would depend on Goebel's proof of the contrary intention of persons long since deceased, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Stuart &amp; Sons, L.P. v. Curtis Publ'g. Co.,</i> 456 F.Supp.2d 336, 348 (D.Conn. 2006).</p>\n<p>[17]  Although most cases discussing the SFQ jurisdictional exception have involved general federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441, the exception is equally available to establish \"copyright\" jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a). <i>See </i><i>Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp.,</i> 486 U.S. 800, 808-809, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988).</p>\n<p>[18]  Even outside the context of copyright co-ownership claims, if the mere possibility of a dispute concerning the interpretation of federal copyright law is sufficient to satisfy the SFQ exception, many other state-law claims which are not preempted by the Copyright Act (<i>viz.,</i> those which include an \"extra element\" beyond mere infringement) nonetheless would be deemed to \"arise under\" federal law. <i>See infra</i> Section II.C.</p>\n<p>[19]  In <i>Smith,</i> plaintiff sought to enjoin corporate directors from investing in a federally chartered land bank, pursuant to a state law which prohibited directors from investing in any government bonds that were issued in violation of the law. <i>Smith,</i> 255 U.S. at 195-96, 41 S.Ct. 243. Plaintiff's complaint alleged that the directors had breached their fiduciary duty to the shareholders because the federal law which authorized the directors of a federal land bank to issue bonds was unconstitutional and invalid. <i>Id.</i> at 197-98, 41 S.Ct. 243. The Court found SFQ jurisdiction because the plaintiff could only prevail on his statutory claim for breach of fiduciary duty by proving his federal constitutional claim. <i>Id.</i> at 201, 41 S.Ct. 243.</p>\n<p>[20]  We often cite the principle set forth in <i>T.B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu,</i> 339 F.2d 823, 828 (2d Cir.1964) (noting that a claim \"arises under\" the Copyright Act if, <i>inter alia,</i> it \"asserts a claim requiring construction of the Act\"), as a device to establish the <i>absence</i> of federal question jurisdiction, <i>see, e.g., id.</i> at 827 (noting that \"if any aspect of the suit <i>requires</i> an interpretation of the Copyright Act, the complaint does not reveal it\") (emphasis added), but we have been reluctant to embrace the test as a reliable means to establish the <i>presence</i> of SFQ jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gener-Villar,</i> 417 F.3d at 206 n. 5 (\"We need not decide whether the Puerto Rico court's analysis of federal copyright preemption law [<i>viz.,</i> that it lacked jurisdiction to decide copyright ownership interests] was precisely correct because, in any event, the [] court viewed its jurisdiction as limited to Puerto Rico claims.\"); <i>First Fed. Sav. and Loan Ass'n v. Greenwald,</i> 591 F.2d 417, 423 (1st Cir.1979) (noting that \"some circuits have taken a broader view of federal question jurisdiction, namely that `(e)ven though the claim is created by state law, a case may \"arise under\" a law of the United States if the complaint discloses a need for determining the meaning or application of such a law,'\" but then refusing to decide whether or not to adopt that rule as circuit law) (citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Royal v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc.,</i> 833 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1987) (referring to the <i>T.B. Harms</i> test as merely \"the most frequently cited test,\" but finding no federal jurisdiction).</p>\n<p>[21]  Further evidence of a lack of congressional intention can be seen in the Copyright Act's statute-of-limitations provision. Rather than stating, in typical fashion, that the limitations period applies to all actions \"arising under\" the Act, the limitations apply only to those claims \"<i>maintained</i> under\" the Act. 17 U.S.C. § 507(b) (emphasis added); <i>see </i><i>Goodman,</i> 78 F.3d at 1013 (noting that even though state-law accounting claim arises under Copyright Act for jurisdictional purposes, the Act's three-year limitations period is not triggered, because the Act contains no remedy as between copyright co-owners, and thus the accounting claim cannot be said to be \"maintained\" under the Act, but instead is maintained under <i>state</i> law).</p>\n<p>[22]  Complete preemption, which is a jurisdictional principle, is distinct from normal \"conflict\" preemption, <i>see </i><i>SPGGC,</i> 488 F.3d at 530 n. 4, 534; <i>Bruneau v. FDIC,</i> 981 F.2d 175, 179-80 (5th Cir.1992); <i>Franks v. Waterfield Mortgage Co.,</i> No. 1:06-00227, 2007 WL 1232218, at *3 (N.D.Ind. Apr.24, 2007), the latter being an affirmative defense which defendant must plead and prove, <i>see </i><i>Fifth Third Bank ex rel. Trust Officer v. CSX Corp.,</i> 415 F.3d 741, 745 (7th Cir.2005); <i>infra</i> section II.C.</p>\n<p>[23]  The two courts of appeals which have held that the Copyright Act completely preempts state law notably involved state causes of action which were the functional equivalent of federal claims for copyright infringement, and <i>not</i> state causes of action between copyright co-owners. <i>See </i><i>Ritchie v. Williams,</i> 395 F.3d 283, 287-88 (6th Cir.2005) (finding that Copyright Act completely preempts all state-law claims which are the <i>qualitative equivalent</i> of a copyright infringement suit); <i>Rosciszewski v. Arete Assocs., Inc.,</i> 1 F.3d 225, 232 (4th Cir.1993) (same).</p>\n<p>[24]  Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the Copyright Act's limitations period applied to the Cambridge accounting claim, I would be compelled to dissent. In my view, Cambridge has demonstrated on appeal that several material factual disputes remain as to when its accounting claim accrued, thus precluding, as a matter of law, any Rule 56 determination of the accrual date. <i>See </i><i>Massey v. United States,</i> 312 F.3d 272, 276 (7th Cir.2002) (\"Summary judgment is properly granted on the basis of a statute of limitations defense if . . . there exist no genuine issues of material fact regarding the time at which plaintiff's claim has accrued.\").</p>\n<p>[25]  The district court held, in the alternative, that even if the Copyright Act's three-year limitations period did not apply to the Cambridge accounting claim, the claim still would be governed by the state's three-year limitations period applicable to tort actions. This alternative holding is demonstrably wrong, for two reasons. First, Goebel would be estopped from asserting this argument by its previous statement, in its first appeal on the personal jurisdiction issue, that Cambridge \"does not assert a cause of action based on tortious activity either within or outside Massachusetts.\" <i>See </i><i>Cadle Co. v. Schlichtmann, Conway, Crowley &amp; Hugo,</i> 338 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.2003) (\"`We generally will not permit litigants to assert contradictory positions at different stages of a lawsuit in order to advance their interests.'\") (citation omitted). Second, the Cambridge accounting claim does not allege that Goebel wrongly retained or converted profits that it derived from Das Hummelbuch, nor could it do so because, as a co-owner of the copyrighted work, Goebel is free to use the copyright to its fullest. <i>See </i><i>Goodman,</i> 78 F.3d at 1012. Only once its co-owners make a suitable demand for an accounting would Goebel have an equitable duty to account to all of its co-owners for their respective shares of those profits. <i>See </i><i>Bacon v. Bacon,</i> 266 Mass. 462, 165 N.E. 485, 488 (1929); <i>Dapkus v. Dapkus,</i> No. 269521-KFS, 2007 WL 1229399, at *3, 2007 WL 1218685 (Mass. Land Ct. Apr. 26, 2007) (unpublished); <i>see also </i><i>Goodman,</i> 78 F.3d at 1013 (\"Under Louisiana law, an action by a co-owner for an accounting is governed by a ten-year prescriptive period (statute of limitations), which `d[oes] not begin to run until demand is made . . . for an accounting.'\") (citation omitted); <i>Bushner v.

Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. &amp; Co. Kg. (Cambridge I),</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span>, 61-62 (1st Cir.2002). Plaintiff Cambridge Literary Properties, Ltd. seeks a share of the profits reaped by defendants W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. &amp; Co. Kg. and Goebel Art G.m.b.H. (collectively, \"Goebel\") for the use of images taken from a German book published in 1934, <i>Das Hummel-Buch,</i> in which Cambridge asserts a copyright interest. Specifically, Cambridge, which acquired its purported \"rights\" from two sets of heirs of a putative joint author of the book, seeks an accounting and imposition of trust on past and future profits Goebel realizes from the distribution of figurines derived from the book, Goebel's use of the particular figure of \"The Merry Wanderer\" as its trademark or logo, the membership fees in the M.I. Hummel Club in the United States, and the like. Whether Cambridge in fact is a co-owner, through co-authorship, of any of its asserted rights is hotly contested by Goebel in its summary judgment papers and its brief on appeal. Indeed, Cambridge's complaint asserts facts acknowledging Goebel's claims of sole ownership.</p>\n<p>The federal courts clearly have jurisdiction over this case. Cambridge chose to file the action in federal district court, and jurisdiction has never been at issue. We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment, affirming the recommendation of the magistrate judge. Plaintiff's ownership of any interest, as we have said, is hotly disputed, and is an issue governed by the Copyright Act. There is no agreement or stipulation of ownership. Yet Cambridge did not seek an adjudication of its ownership rights before seeking whatever remedy it may have if it has any ownership rights. Thus, this case is not a dispute between admitted co-owners. Rather, the complaint attempts to evade the issue of whether Cambridge has any ownership rights by simply asserting that Cambridge is a co-owner and then alleging that Cambridge, as a co-owner, is entitled under state law to an accounting and equitable trust. As a result, Cambridge argues, the federal statute of limitations that applies to establishing copyright ownership under the Copyright Act does not apply; rather, the state statute of limitations for an accounting applies.</p>\n<p>The accounting and equitable trust claims created by state law are premature. Such claims may well be governed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> by state law, but they are not ripe and necessarily rest upon plaintiff having met the antecedent showing that it has ownership rights under the Copyright Act. Plaintiff may not assert the state-law claims for accounting or equitable trust without establishing that it is a co-owner. Whether Cambridge is a co-owner in turn depends, on the facts of this case,<sup>[1]</sup> upon the federal Copyright Act. This in turn requires that Cambridge have asserted its ownership claims within that statute's limitations period. The congressional intent that the Act's limitations period applies to claims of ownership under the Act may not be undercut by Cambridge's subterfuge.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the Act, the cause of action accrues when a plaintiff \"knows or has reason to know of the act which is the basis of the claim.\" <i>Santa-Rosa v.

Cambridge may not escape the limitations bar if the statute barred the claims of the heirs from which it acquired the \"rights.\" <i>Young v.

Cambridge is also barred if it failed to timely act within the limitations period after it acquired the rights. Here, Cambridge and the heirs, on the undisputed facts, were put on sufficient notice to result in accrual more than three years before plaintiff instituted suit. Further, there is no basis for equitable tolling of the three-year limitations period.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>In describing the facts of the dispute, we make all reasonable inferences in favor of Cambridge, the party opposing summary judgment. <i>T-Peg, Inc. v.

In 1931, Hummel took her vows as a member of the Congregation of Franciscan Sisters at the Convent of Siessen (\"Convent\") and became Sister Maria Innocentia Hummel. Sister Hummel and the Convent published some of Sister Hummel's drawings as postcards and devotional pictures.</p>\n<p>In 1934, a German publishing company, Emil Fink Verlag (\"Fink\"), approached Sister Hummel and the Convent about publishing some of Sister Hummel's artworks in a book. In May of that year, Sister Hummel, the Superior of the Convent, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> and Fink entered into an agreement authorizing Fink to reproduce forty of Sister Hummel's works in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> The contract specified that the book would include, in addition to the drawings, poems and other text. About six months later, Fink contracted with Margarete Seemann, a Viennese poet, for the production of an introduction and fifty poems for use in the book.</p>\n<p>Fink first published <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> in Germany in December 1934. Fink applied to the United States Copyright Office for a copyright in the book in June 1936. Fink's application lists Emil Fink Verlag as the \"copyright owner,\" and Hummel and Seemann as \"author[s] or translator[s].\"</p>\n<p>Back in Germany, Fink was not the only firm seeking to commercialize Sister Hummel's drawings. Franz Goebel, then the head of Goebel, also entered into a contract with Sister Hummel and the Convent in January 1935. In that contract, Sister Hummel and the Convent assigned to Goebel the exclusive right to manufacture and market porcelain figurines based on Sister Hummel's drawings. Goebel continues to produce its line of \"M.I. Hummel figurines\" to this day. Goebel Art, a wholly owned subsidiary of Goebel, acts as the exclusive distributor and licensing agent for Goebel's United States copyright interests derived from the 1935 contract. In addition to the sale of figurines, Goebel also profits from the Hummel copyrights through Goebel Art's \"M.I. Hummel Club,\" which generates substantial income from membership fees.</p>\n<p>In June 1962, Fink applied for a renewal copyright in \"<i>Das Hummel-Buch,</i> by Berta Hummel . . . [preface and verses by] Margarete Seemann.\" The publishing house listed itself as \"proprietor of copyright in a work made for hire.\" In 1971, Goebel purchased all of Fink's copyrights in Hummel-related works, including the American copyright in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> That sale was also memorialized in documents filed with the Copyright Office.</p>\n<p>Goebel was not always the sole American distributor of Hummel figurines. Until the mid-1990s, Goebel contracted with Schmid Brothers, Inc. (\"Schmid\") to distribute the figurines in the United States. Schmid and Goebel quarreled repeatedly over their business arrangement in the courts of Germany and the United States. Sometime in the late 1960s, an attorney named Henry Herrmann began working for Schmid on matters related to disputes with Goebel. By 1971, Herrmann had obtained for Schmid an assignment of copyrights from Sister Hummel's family; Sister Hummel had died in 1946. Herrmann also represented Schmid in a number of lawsuits pertaining to the Hummel rights. Herrman is the driving force behind Cambridge in the present dispute.</p>\n<p>In 1992, during a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of New York, Schmid and Goebel entered into a consent judgment that stated that the two parties owned \"respective undivided one-half interests in the United States renewal copyright in [<i>Das Hummel-Buch</i>].\" Herrmann executed the agreement on behalf of Schmid.</p>\n<p>Schmid, which held interests in <i>Das Hummel-Buch,</i> filed for bankruptcy in 1993. Herrmann, as a creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings, filed a claim for over $10,000,000 based on a contingency fee agreement with his former client. Herrmann settled his claim for $3,750,000. Goebel, for its part, acquired Schmid's rights to the book in the wake of Schmid's bankruptcy. With that acquisition, Goebel's ownership interest in the United States copyright to <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> appeared to be perfected.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> At some point during the Goebel-Schmid litigation, Herrmann came to think that Margarete Seemann's heirs might retain an interest in the United States copyright for <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> because Seemann's poems appear in the book. In order to exploit that interest, Herrmann sought an assignment of copyright interests from Seemann's heirs. Herrmann formed Cambridge in August 1995 to effectuate that purpose. Herrmann continues to be the sole shareholder in Cambridge in addition to representing the company in this litigation.</p>\n<p>Also in 1995, Herrmann identified Seemann's heirs and assignees of Seemann's alleged United States copyright interests in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> They were Maria Romanowicz, a resident of Vienna, and Dr. Alexandrine Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic, a resident of Belgrade. Herrmann approached both heirs in August and September of 1995 with offers to purchase such United States copyright interests as they held in the book.</p>\n<p>On September 6, 1995, Maria Romanowicz signed a contract assigning to Cambridge all of her \"right, title and interest in and to any and all United States Copyright Renewals in any of the works authored and/or co-authored by [Seemann], including, without limitation, the work `Das Hummel-Buch.'\" The contract also specified that \"included in this assignment are any and all of my legal and/or equitable monetary claims and causes of action I may have under American laws as of the date hereof for payments . . . and/or accountings against third parties\" for their exploitation of the United States copyright to <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> As to the other heir, although Herrmann first approached Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic in 1995, he did not obtain an assignment from her to Cambridge until February 1999. The terms of the second assignment were identical to the first.</p>\n<p>Having thus assembled what it represented to be a fifty-percent interest (based on any interest held by the poet Seemann) in the United States copyright to <i>Das Hummel-Buch,</i> Cambridge filed the current action in the District of Massachusetts in February 2000, basing jurisdiction on diversity and, conditionally, on federal question jurisdiction.<sup>[3]</sup> Cambridge's complaint pleaded two \"claims\": one for \"an accounting from [Goebel] of their profits from their use and benefit of said book and the two and three dimensional works derived therefrom\"; and a separate claim for unjust enrichment seeking as a remedy \"restitution and [] a decree imposing a constructive trust . . . on [Goebel's] intellectual property relating to the works derived from the [b]ook.\" The complaint states, in conclusory fashion, that Cambridge is entitled to these remedies due to its status as \"joint legal and/or beneficial owner[] of the United States Renewal Copyright\" in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i><sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> Cambridge does not claim it owns any independent copyright interests in any images created by Sister Hummel. Rather, it says its rights are derivative from Seemann.<sup>[5]</sup> Seemann, Cambridge alleges, obtained an interest in the United States copyright for <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> by virtue of her co-author status with Hummel and/or Fink. Cambridge alleges the book was a \"joint work\" between Hummel and Seemann, and that the copyright in the book therefore granted Seemann rights in all the contents of the book, including Hummel's illustrations. Cambridge further alleges that Goebel based the designs of at least some of the Hummel figurines on particular images from the book, and not on Hummel artworks of independent provenance. Those figurines, according to Cambridge, represented works derivative of the book. Cambridge, assignee of Seemann's heirs and half-owner, along with Goebel, of the book copyright, would thus be entitled to half of the proceeds of all exploitation of the book copyright in the United States. From these co-ownership rights, Cambridge argues, it is owed an accounting for Goebel's profits from the sale of at least some of its figurines and other uses of Hummel imagery in the United States. Goebel has disputed these contentions throughout this litigation.</p>\n<p>The district court initially dismissed Cambridge's suit for want of personal jurisdiction. This court reversed and remanded. <i>Cambridge I,</i> 295 F.3d at 66-68. On remand, the district court again did not reach the merits of Cambridge's accounting or unjust enrichment claims. Instead, it granted Goebel's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the Copyright Act's three-year statute of limitations barred Cambridge's suit. <i>Cambridge II,</i> 448 F.Supp.2d at 247; <i>see also</i> 17 U.S.C. § 507(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review de novo the entry of summary judgment in the district court. <i>T-Peg,</i> 459 F.3d at 111. Summary judgment is proper here if the record, read favorably to Cambridge, reflects no genuine issues of material fact and the undisputed facts demonstrate that Goebel is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>T-Peg,</i> 459 F.3d at 111; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p>Cambridge contends on appeal that Massachusetts law governs a claim for accounting for profits, and that consequently the Copyright Act's statute of limitations does not apply. The issue is more complicated than that. This framing of the argument assumes that the question of ownership had been resolved, by agreement or by a court judgment, before the state-law remedy of accounting was sought. An action brought by a copyright co-owner seeking equitable remedies from another co-owner, even if those remedies are governed by state law, requires that the plaintiff first establish the existence of the right giving rise to the remedy. <i>See, e.g., MacDonald v. Page Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span> (1925); 1A C.J.S. <i>Accounting</i> § 23 (2007). In the case of an accounting for profits by a co-owner of a copyright where ownership is in dispute, that means the claimant must first establish it has ownership as a predicate to an award of an accounting for profits. The ownership question may be one of state law or of federal law, depending on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> facts of a case. In cases involving rights such as those at issue here, plaintiffs usually raise this threshold issue by seeking a declaratory judgment for ownership. <i>See </i><i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 225-26; <i>Royal v.

The omission does not remove the predicate question of ownership from the case, and whether Cambridge has any ownership interest is in dispute, even on the face of the complaint.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Applicability of the Copyright Act</i></p>\n<p>Copyright cases may raise different issues, some of which are controlled by federal law and some of which may refer to and be controlled by state law. We noted as much about this very case in <i>Cambridge I. See</i> 295 F.3d at 64 n. 4 (recognizing that Cambridge's claims might necessitate reference to \"federal copyright law and German contract law as to whether Hummel, Seemann, and Fink are co-owners; Austrian inheritance law if the Seemann rights are disputed; federal copyright law as to whether the figurines are derivative works; and to the law of any of several jurisdictions as to the rights and defenses among co-owners\").</p>\n<p>Here the necessary initial question ownership of copyright interestsis governed by the Copyright Act. Because that question is governed by the Act, the Act's statute of limitations applies as well. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 507(b) (\"No civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued.\"). It would be anomalous and, we think, contrary to congressional language and intent not to apply the Act's limitations period when the Act governs the question of ownership interest.</p>\n<p>Our view that a single copyright case can raise different issues governed by different laws is well accepted. In an instructive if not directly parallel case, the Supreme Court addressed the applicability of federal and state law in actions asserting copyright interests. In <i>De Sylva v. Ballentine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>. The ownership determination hinged on a provision in the Copyright Act, then in effect, which was ambiguous on two issues: whether children of authors could inherit copyright renewal rights during the lifetime of the author's widow; and whether \"children,\" as used within the Copyright Act, included illegitimate offspring. <i>Id.</i> at 572, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court held that \"[t]he scope of a federal right is, of course, a federal question,\" and interpreted the ambiguous Copyright Act provision to resolve the ownership issue. <i>Id.</i> at 580, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>. The Court did reference state law in the course of construing the Act. As to the discrete issue of whether the term \"children\" included illegitimate offspring, the Court noted that \"there is no federal law of domestic relations, which is primarily a matter of state concern.\" <i>Id.</i> Because the federal Act did not address the issue at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> hand, which was \"really a question of the descent of property,\" the Court looked to the California Probate Code, the source of law that would govern descent of the composer's estate, to give content to the term \"children\" as used in the Copyright Act. <i>Id.</i> at 581-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The current Copyright Act treats determinations of the rights at issue here as questions of authorship status and initial ownership of copyrights. Section 101 of the current Act expressly defines terms such as \"copyright owner,\" \"joint work,\" and \"work made for hire.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101. Section 201 of the Act explicitly controls vesting of copyright in authors; sets out the ownership status of authors and co-authors of joint works; and establishes copyright ownership by employers who commission works made for hire. 17 U.S.C. § 201. There is a substantial federal interest in having the federal statute of limitations applied to these determinations.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Act also contains a provision that expressly preempts state common-law copyright protection and all other \"legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright. . . .\" 17 U.S.C. § 301(a). That provision, while by its terms governs the preemption of causes of action, presupposes the existence of \"legal or equitable rights\" which are, in turn, defined elsewhere in the Act.</p>\n<p>Our concern is thus not, as Cambridge suggests, with whether the Act preempts a state accounting cause of action. That is a hypothetical question on the facts of this case, and we do not give advisory opinions. Our concern is only with whether the federal statute of limitations applies to the prerequisite issues of ownership which are governed by the Act.</p>\n<p>All of the federal circuit courts of appeal that have addressed the issue, including this one, agree that a determination of copyright ownership based on a disputed allegation of co-authorship presents a federal question that arises under, and must be determined according to, the Copyright Act. <i>See </i><i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 227; <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Gaiman,</i> 360 F.3d at 652-53; <i>Merchant,</i> 92 F.3d at 55-56; <i>Goodman II,</i> 78 F.3d at 1010.<sup>[6]</sup> Where an ownership claim arises under the Copyright Act, the Act's three-year statute of limitations likewise applies. <i>Gaiman,</i> 360 F.3d at 653; <i>see also </i><i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 227; <i>Merchant,</i> 92 F.3d at 56. Some cases address the question in the context of performing an \"arising under\" analysis to determine whether there is federal jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Merchant,</i> 92 F.3d at 55; <i>see also </i><i>Royal,</i> 833 F.2d at 2-3 (adopting test for original federal subject matter jurisdiction in <i>T.B. Harms v. Eliscu,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"266382\"><a href=\"/opinion/266382/t-b-harms-company-v-edward-eliscu-and-ross-jungnickel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1964)). Here, there is diversity jurisdiction, but the question of whether there is a federal question under the Copyright Act as to the prerequisite of co-ownership involves parallel reasoning.</p>\n<p>Cambridge attempts to avoid this conclusion by arguing that \"the Act's limitations do not apply to actions for accounting between co-owners.\" As we have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> said, that is not the issue. Cambridge argues that it is the fact that the action is one which the complaint labels as being for an accounting that makes the difference.<sup>[7]</sup> If co-ownership were conceded and the only question was a claim for accounting of profits from the other joint owner, then Cambridge could argue the suit was only for an accounting of profits under state law. <i>Gaiman,</i> 360 F.3d at 652. But under a long line of federal cases, Cambridge must first establish that it is a co-owner, and the answer to that lies in the application of the Copyright Act and subjects that claim to the Act's statute of limitations. <i>See id.</i> at 652-53. Cambridge cannot avoid this by the stratagem of failing to ask for a declaration of ownership as a method of avoiding the federal limitations period for an ownership claim governed by the federal Act.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Cambridge cites <i>Goodman II,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714816\"><a href=\"/opinion/714816/shirley-goodman-v-audrey-lee-and-nikki-n-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span>, as support for its argument. That case does not support Cambridge's position; it does support our view of the case. In <i>Goodman,</i> a musician sued the heirs of her former performing partner for a declaration of co-authorship and an accounting for royalties from the song \"Let the Good Times Roll.\" <i>Goodman v. Lee (Goodman I),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486402\"><a href=\"/opinion/486402/shirley-goodman-v-audrey-lee-and-nikki-n-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></a></span>, 1031 (5th Cir.1987). The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> The Fifth Circuit reversed \"[b]ecause . . . exclusive federal district court jurisdiction exists in an action for a declaratory judgment to establish joint authorship of a copyrighted work. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 1032.</p>\n<p>After trial, the <i>Goodman</i> jury found that the plaintiff \"was a co-author of [the song]\" and that her claim was timely because \"she `did not know or should not have known'\" until the year before filing suit that her co-author had listed himself as the sole author on the copyright registration. <i>Goodman II,</i> 78 F.3d at 1010. Only after the co-authorship issue was resolved did the court address the issue of an accounting.</p>\n<p>On appeal in <i>Goodman,</i> the defendants contested the district court's remedial award of an accounting. The Fifth Circuit held that the remedy of an accounting did not itself present any federal questions, unlike the resolved predicate question of ownership, and that Louisiana law, including the state statute of limitations, governed the accounting issues. <i>Id.</i> at 1012-13.</p>\n<p>The <i>Goodman</i> decisions are entirely consistent with the prevailing view that disputed claims about whether there is co-authorship require application of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> Copyright Act and the Act's statute of limitations. The portion of the opinion that applied state law is inapposite here, because it dealt with accounting issues that only arose following a proper determination of copyright ownership under the Copyright Act. Cambridge has not cleared that hurdle of establishing ownership.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>The controversy over Cambridge's copyright interests directly involves Seemann's authorship status and her initial ownership of the copyright in <i>Das Hummel-Buch,</i> as well as the effect of various registration documents and transfers. The Copyright Act clearly covers these issues. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. §§ 101, 201, 204-05, 410. We hold as a matter of law that on the facts of this case, Cambridge's allegations of co-ownership present an issue subject to the Copyright Act and that the Act's three-year statute of limitations applies to that issue, which must be resolved before the issue of an accounting arises.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Application of the Act's Accrual Rules to These Claims</i></p>\n<p>The Copyright Act bars lawsuits premised on a copyright claim brought after three years from accrual of that claim. 17 U.S.C. § 507(b). A claim accrues when a plaintiff \"knows or has reason to know of the act which is the basis for the claim.\" <i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 227 (internal quotation omitted). If Cambridge's claims accrued earlier than February 24, 1997, three years before Cambridge filed the present suit, the suit is barred.</p>\n<p>In <i>Santa-Rosa,</i> we applied the accrual test to a 2004 suit by a renowned salsa musician requesting a declaration of co-ownership in several recordings he allegedly co-authored in the mid-1980s. 471 F.3d at 225-26. We affirmed dismissal of the suit as time-barred. <i>Id.</i> at 228.</p>\n<p><i>Santa-Rosa</i> held that the plaintiff knew or should have known of the basis for his claim to co-authorship of the songs at the moment of their creation. <i>Id.</i> After all, \"`[a] co-author knows that he or she jointly created a work from the moment of its creation,'\" and thus would have been aware at that time of a claim for co-ownership. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Merchant,</i> 92 F.3d at 56); <i>cf.</i> 17 U.S.C. § 101 (defining \"joint work\" as \"a work prepared by two or more authors with the <i>intention</i> that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole\" (emphasis added)). \"Thus,\" <i>Santa-Rosa</i> reasoned, \"there is little question that [plaintiff's] claims for co-ownership accrued as soon as he finished recording each album.\" 471 F.3d at 228. In <i>Santa-Rosa</i> the claimant was the co-author, and not an heir.</p>\n<p><i>Santa-Rosa</i> acknowledged, however, that other courts have applied the accrual test differently. For instance, the Ninth Circuit has held that a claim for a declaration of ownership under the Copyright Act does not accrue until \"a `plain and express repudiation of co-ownership is communicated to the claimant.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Zuill,</i> 80 F.3d at 1369). Even under this more claimant-friendly standard, however, the <i>Santa-Rosa</i> plaintiff could not prevail, because there was plain and express repudiation of co-ownership from the fact that the defendant record company \"openly, and quite notoriously, sold [plaintiff's] records without providing payment to him\" more than three years before the plaintiff filed suit. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> Under the reasoning of <i>Santa-Rosa,</i> the accrual inquiry in this case would initially be directed at Margarete Seemann and her knowledge of potential ownership claims in the 1930s. If, as Cambridge claims, Seemann had co-authored <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> as a joint work, she would by definition have been aware of her status as joint owner of the book and all of its contents. Seemann also conceivably received notice of a repudiation of her ownership status when Goebel began marketing Hummel figurines in the 1930s and failed to pay Seemann any royalties. Under a literal reading of <i>Santa-Rosa,</i> Seemann's claims for a declaration of co-authorship of the book would have accrued long before her death in 1949.</p>\n<p>The <i>Santa-Rosa</i> model for accrual does not work well here because the Copyright Act did not contain a statute of limitations for civil actions until 1957. <i>See</i> 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 12.05[A] (2007). We also do not reach the question of whether the claims based on Seemann's work accrued within three years after a statute of limitations was added to the Copyright Act. Instead, we ask whether any claims held by Cambridge and/or the assignors of the rights Cambridge alleges descended from Seemann accrued before the case was brought.</p>\n<p>1. <i>The Romanowicz Assignment</i></p>\n<p>Maria Romanowicz, Seemann's heir in Vienna, assigned whatever rights she may have had in the book's United States copyright to Cambridge by September 6, 1995. We do not address whether Romanowicz's rights were time-barred at that time.</p>\n<p>Cambridge did not file suit within three years of acquisition of those rights, and based on its knowledge at the time, the claim is barred. Cambridge was on notice of a repudiation of those rights by the time of the assignment. Herrmann, Cambridge's sole shareholder and negotiating adversary to Romanowicz, was privy to the Schmid-Goebel settlement agreement stipulating that those two companies owned all rights to the book in the United States. Moreover, Herrmann knew that Romanowicz was not receiving royalties from Goebel on the sale of Hummel figurines.</p>\n<p>The most cogent evidence of accrual is Cambridge's own motivation for approaching Romanowicz. What Cambridge sought to purchase was essentially a cause of action against Goebel. Cambridge was aware of whatever potential claims against Goebel the purchase would bolster, and even ensured that the assignment contract specified a transfer of any and all claims for accountings under United States law. With respect to the Romanowicz assignment, the statute of limitations under the Copyright Act started running against Cambridge no later than September 1995. Because there was no tolling (as we explain below), section 507(b) of the Copyright Act barred Cambridge's claims based on the Romanowicz assignment before this suit was filed in 2000.</p>\n<p>2. <i>The Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic Assignment</i></p>\n<p>On the undisputed facts, Dr. Alexandrine Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic, Margarete Seemann's heir in Belgrade, knewor reasonably should have known about the basis for a claim of co-ownership of the United States copyright to <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> before February 1997. In making this determination, we do not decide whether Seemann co-authored the book, whether Goebel's figurines were derivatives of the book, or whether any rights that descended from Seemann to the heirs entitled the heirs to share in profits derived from sales of the figurines. The accrual test looks to the existence of a claim, not its resolution.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> Herrmann first contacted Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic's attorney in Vienna, Dr. Theodor Petter, in 1995. Petter referred Herrmann directly to Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic to discuss an assignment of copyrights. Herrmann testified that in a conversation that same year, Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic indicated that \"she was very interested in gaining some income based upon an assignment of her American rights. . . .\" She referred Herrmann back to Petter, and the two attorneys commenced negotiations.<sup>[10]</sup> At that time, Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic knew she was not receiving any payments on any inherited co-author ownership right in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> She also was aware that Fink had not paid her royalties on the original German book, in contrast with Fink's payment until 1973 to the heirs of royalties on an English-language <i>The Hummel Book.</i><sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Starting at the latest in 1995, when she was contacted by Herrmann, Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic had every motivation to ascertain the existence and potential value of her rights in the book, and she had counsel in Vienna to assist her in that task. Yet she did not bring suit within three years, even though readily available inquiries would have revealed numerous repudiations of the \"rights\" Cambridge sought to purchase.</p>\n<p>There were a number of different signs of repudiation, which in total require the conclusion that the claims had accrued. Publicly available documents in the United States Copyright Office raised issues about Seemann's purported ownership of <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> First, the original 1936 application for a United States copyright in the book lists the publishing house Emil Fink Verlag as the \"copyright owner.\" Second, the 1962 application for the renewal copyright lists the publisher as \"proprietor of copyright in a work made for hire.\" Third, a 1971 transfer document, recorded in accordance with 17 U.S.C. § 205, expressly names Fink as owner of the copyright and describes an assignment of the copyright to Goebel. Fourth, due diligence, including questions to Cambridge, may well have led to information about the litigation which resulted in the 1992 Consent Decree. There is another point as well. Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic openly expressed to Herrmann when he telephoned her in 1995 that she was interested in obtaining income from whatever rights she might hold.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, if Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic indeed possessed a joint interest in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> book's United States copyright as an heir to Seemann, then she would have been entitled to the exclusive right \"to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(2). Goebel, meanwhile, had been \"openly[] and quite notoriously\" exploiting works for decades that appeared in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i><sup>[12]</sup><i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 228. At least one of Goebel's much-used and apparently profitable images appears in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> Cambridge's complaint points out that Goebel has \"for decades utilized, in a particular and crucial fashion, one specific picture . . . popularly known as `The Merry Wanderer,'\" which \"`ultimately became the <i>symbol</i> for the entire M.I. Hummel line.'\" Yet Goebel never paid the heirs for its use of The Merry Wanderer.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>The sum, by 1995, of all of this was to start the limitations period running. Publicly available documents in the Copyright Office and prior litigation cast doubt on Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic's rights in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> Moreover, Goebel engaged in widespread exploitation of at least some portion of those rights, such as its use of The Merry Wanderer, without remuneration to Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic. Such circumstances constituted a \"plain and express repudiation\" of Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic's purported co-ownership rights in <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> sufficient to trigger the Copyright Act's three-year statute of limitations. <i>Santa-Rosa,</i> 471 F.3d at 228 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>Whether Seemann co-authored <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> or not, the right to contest that status lay with the poet's heirs until they assigned them to Cambridge. Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic did not file suit by 1998. Cambridge did not resurrect that claim by purchasing an assignment from Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic in 1999. \"[A]n assignee cannot maintain a claim in the face of a limitations defense that would have trumped the same claim had it been brought by the assignor.\" <i>Young,</i> 305 F.3d at 17.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Tolling</i></p>\n<p>Cambridge argues that a \"legal disability\" tolled the statute of limitations against its claims based on the assignment from Romanowicz in 1995. Cambridge could not have filed this case until 1999, it claims, because \"until then the sole basis for alleging Goebel's exploitation was documents classified as `SECRET' by a federal court in another earlier matter-the content of which [Herrmann] was duty bound not to disclose.\"</p>\n<p>Cambridge's position, even taken on its own terms, is baseless. Just as all the reasons we have outlined would have put Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic on notice of a repudiation of Seemann's status as co-author, those reasons provided more than adequate grounds for Cambridge to allege that Goebel had prepared works derivative of the book. Cambridge need not have relied on any documents under protective order to file this lawsuit. There was no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> tolling of Cambridge's claims based on the Romanowicz assignment.</p>\n<p>We affirm summary judgment in favor of defendants. Costs are awarded to defendants.</p>\n<p>CYR, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The majority opinion holds that since the Cambridge state-law accounting claim might require it to establish as a threshold matter that its predecessor-in-interest, Margarete Seemann, was an original co-owner of the copyright in Das Hummelbuch, the Cambridge claim thus \"arises under\" the Copyright Act for purposes of both subject matter jurisdiction and, by logical extension, the Act's three-year statute of limitations. Inasmuch as the ramifications of this holding<i>viz.,</i> that the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate all accounting claims between the co-owners of a copyrighted work, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a)-are both unprecedented and potentially pernicious, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The majority relies principally on decisions such as <i>De Sylva v. Ballentine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1415</span></a></span> (1956), for the proposition that any state-law cause of action which potentially involves a threshold determination of the plaintiff's copyright ownership must be said to \"arise under\" the Copyright Act (<i>viz.,</i> a <i>de facto</i> federal cause of action), and thus is governed by the Act and subject to its three-year statute of limitations, thereby rendering any discrete inquiry into the scope of the Act's preemptive effect immaterial. However, <i>De Sylva</i> was a non-diversity case in which the plaintiff expressly filed a claim pursuant to the Copyright Act, demanding a <i>declaratory judgment</i> that she was a co-owner of a copyrighted work, and consequently the Court assumed that the Copyright Act's substantive definitions concerning copyright ownership governed any decision on the merits of the plaintiff's federal-law claim. <i>See id.</i> at 975.<sup>[14]</sup> To establish subject matter jurisdiction, a declaratory judgment plaintiff normally must demonstrate more than its desire to settle its rights under federal law, but must show \"a real and reasonable apprehension\" that the defendant plans to sue to establish that the plaintiff is not so entitled, <i>viz.,</i> that Goebel planned to litigate a dispute as to whether the Cambridge chain of title originated with a person who was a \"co-owner\" of the copyright as defined by the Copyright Act of 1909. <i>See generally,</i> 3-12 Melville B. Nimmer &amp; David Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 12.01 (2005) (noting that \"the [federal] Declaratory Judgment Act [28 U.S.C. § 2201(a)] does not, of its own force, confer subject matter jurisdiction on the federal courts\"; \"[o]nce an action for declaratory relief is instituted, the defendant can attempt to negate the element of reasonable apprehension of litigation by entering a binding covenant not to sue.\"). When the plaintiff himself pleads a claim for declaratory judgment, the ownership of the Copyright Act title is not merely a <i>potential</i> focus of dispute, it is the only issue relevant to an adjudication of the declaratory action.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> In stark contrast, Cambridge filed no federal-law claim for a declaration of copyright ownership under the Copyright Act, but merely a claim in equity for an accounting between tenants in common of property, which is premised entirely on state-created common law. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Arsenault v.

For example, Goebel itself notes that, if Goebel denies the allegation, Cambridge eventually may need to prove as well that the Hummel figurines were \"derivative works\" from the illustrations contained in Das Hummelbuch, <i>see</i> 17 U.S.C. § 101, and failure to establish that fact might prove equally dispositive and fatal to the accounting claim. <i>Grable</i> makes clear, however, that the mere presence of these potential federal issues is insufficient to create SFQ jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Unlike the plaintiff in <i>De Sylva,</i> who expressly included in his complaint a request for a declaration of his co-ownership rights in the copyright, the Cambridge complaint does not place its co-ownership of the copyright in \"active dispute.\" Such an active dispute would arise, if at all, at the time Goebel files its answer to the complaint, <i>see supra</i> note 16, and pursuant to the well-pleaded complaint rule, this is insufficient to invoke SFQ jurisdiction. Further, it simply is not the case that Goebel necessarily will forfeit its chances of winning the case if it chooses not to contest the Cambridge co-ownership interests. If Goebel stipulates to the Cambridge co-ownership rights under 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 and 201(a), it will have done no more than concede Cambridge's standing to bring suit under state law.</p>\n<p>3. <i>The \"Congressional Intent\" Requirement</i></p>\n<p>Application of the SFQ exception to this type of accounting claim between copyright co-owners also would serve no apparent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> congressional policy concerning the proper allocation of jurisdictional labor between the federal and state courts in cases which happen to involve copyrighted material. <i>See </i><i>Templeton Bd. of Sewer Comm'rs v.

In <i>Data General,</i> the relationship was fiduciary; here, the relationship is joint ownership of property giving rise to an equitable duty to provide an accounting of profits. The Copyright Act does not preempt the state-law accounting claim, and thus it cannot be dismissed on preemption grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>CONCLUSION</i></h2>\n<p>In order to bring the Cambridge state-law cause of action under the Copyright Act's three-year limitations provision, the majority announces a blanket jurisdictional rule which threatens to draw into the federal courts many copyright-related claims over which Congress deliberately intended to give the state courts concurrent jurisdiction. As the state courts are perfectly competent to interpret Copyright Act definitions that may be tangentially relevant to their disposition of state-law causes of action, the mere possibility that they may <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> need to consult those statutory definitions should not convert claims which essentially arise under state law into federal claims, particularly where the corresponding federal statute has eschewed comparable remedies. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Not all claims of co-ownership will arise under the Copyright Act, and our decision does not affect such cases. For example, at times, whether there is co-ownership may be determined by the terms of a contract governed by state law or through other ownership interests governed by state law and thus not require application of the Copyright Act. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Royal v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497011\"><a href=\"/opinion/497011/james-b-royal-v-leading-edge-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.1987) (rejecting federal question jurisdiction where claim of co-ownership, \"in its very nature and essence, [was] one for breach of contract\" under state law). In other cases, such as where co-ownership results from purported statutory co-authorship, the question of co-ownership is governed by the Copyright Act. <i>See</i> 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 12.01[A][1][b] (2007) (endorsing view that in an action seeking declaratory judgment of plaintiff as co-author and for an accounting, federal jurisdiction is exclusive because \"copyright ownership by reason of one's status as co-author arises directly from the terms of the Copyright Act itself\"); <i>see also </i><i>Gaiman v. McFarlane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785344\"><a href=\"/opinion/785344/neil-gaiman-and-marvels-and-miracles-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span>, 652-53 (7th Cir. 2004) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>[2]  We do not hold, nor is it a ramification of our holding, that federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate all accounting claims between the co-owners of a copyrighted work.</p>\n<p>[3]  The complaint states that the District of Massachusetts \"has diversity jurisdiction . . . pursuant to [28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)]\" and \"[f]urther, if this action were determined to be arising under Federal copyright statutes, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1338.\" Am. Compl. ¶¶ 16-17.</p>\n<p>[4]  At the same time, however, the complaint concedes that Goebel and other parties had previously asserted the ownership rights to the United States copyright in <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> without ever acknowledging any ownership interest by Seemann or her heirs. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Am. Compl. ¶¶ 44-45 (\"Goebel, claiming as alleged owner of the Book Renewal . . . has previously, in a United States District Court, made claim for alleged infringement of the Book Renewal.\"); <i>id.</i> ¶ 66 (alleging that a 1992 federal court consent decree named Schmid and a Goebel subsidiary \"undivided joint owners of the Book Renewal\"). Similarly, the complaint reveals that Goebel had previously represented the contents of the book as \"works for hire\" rather than \"joint works,\" which would mean that even if Seemann held the copyright in her poems, her rights would not extend to Hummel's illustrations. Am. Compl. ¶ 44.</p>\n<p>[5]  At no time has Cambridge alleged that Goebel exploited Seemann's written contributions to <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i></p>\n<p>[6]  Nothing in our decision in <i>Royal</i> is inconsistent, contrary to Cambridge's argument. In <i>Royal,</i> we upheld dismissal of a claim for declaration of copyright ownership because that claim did not create federal question jurisdiction. 833 F.2d at 2. Here, jurisdiction is not at issue. In addition, the <i>Royal</i> claimant's theory of ownership turned not on his status as a co-author, but on an alleged breach of a royalty agreement between the claimant and his employer. <i>Id.</i> at 1-3. Because \"[the claimant's] assertions gr[e]w out of his purported contract rights,\" state law controlled their resolution and failed to create federal subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n<p>[7]  Our holding is that the federal period of limitations, and not a state limitations period, applies to the predicate question of co-authorship rights, which is governed by the Copyright Act. We see no need to address the defense of preemption raised by Goebel, <i>see</i> 17 U.S.C. § 301, or Cambridge's argument that there is no preemption. In particular, Cambridge argues that a grandfathering provision saves the accounting claim from preemption because it involves \"undertakings commenced before January 1, 1978,\" i.e., Goebel's exploitation of Hummel imagery from 1935 to the present. <i>Id.</i> § 301(b)(2). Our holding rests on the fact that the issue of ownership must be addressed first and is controlled by the Copyright Act's limitations period. This is true whether or not the claim for an accounting under state law is preempted.</p>\n<p>[8]  If Cambridge is arguing that the grandfathering clause in section 301(b)(2) somehow makes the co-authorship issue not an issue of federal law under the Act, then Cambridge is wrong. By its own terms, section 301(b) is limited in its application only to \"rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any State.\" <i>Id.</i> § 301(b). Pre-1978 claims of co-author status are governed by the Copyright Act of 1909. <i>Cf. </i><i>De Sylva,</i> 351 U.S. at 580, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>[9]  The question of whether a claim for an accounting for profits realized from exploitation of a jointly-owned copyright-once that ownership is established-is subject to state-law limitations is not one that we need decide. <i>See supra</i> note 7.</p>\n<p>[10]  Petter died soon thereafter. In 1996, Petter's daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Fetcher-Petter, took over her father's law practice and resumed negotiations with Herrmann. Fetcher-Petter described those negotiations as \"productive but extremely lengthy\"; the assignment from Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic to Cambridge was finally executed on February 9, 1999.</p>\n<p>[11]  A stipulation between the parties indicates that Fink paid book royalties to the heirs until 1973. Cambridge argues that \"[t]hese payments constituted an <i>affirmation</i> of [Cermanovic-Kuzmanovic's] interests [in the book] both by Fink and [Goebel]. . . .\" Cambridge's argument fails. The stipulation states that Fink paid royalties to Seemann and her heirs for sales of <i>The Hummel Book,</i> the English translation of <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> The 1934 contract between Fink and Seemann treated these as two separate properties. Fink was to pay Seemann three lump sums in 1934 for the use of her poems in <i>Das Hummel-Buch.</i> Fink could, according to the contract, prepare translations of the German book only by mutual agreement with Seemann, and the poet would receive a 4% royalty on the retail price of any translated books. As a translation, <i>The Hummel Book</i> itself is a derivative work, the ownership of which \"does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material.\" 17 U.S.C. §§ 101, 103. Any rights in a translation of <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> would therefore not extend to any of the images contained in the original German edition.</p>\n<p>[12]  Goebel does not argue that the mere manufacturing and marketing of Hummel figurines put the heirs on notice, regardless of the heirs' knowledge of the source for the figurines.</p>\n<p>[13]  Cambridge argues that the apparent repudiation of any rights held by Seemann in The Merry Wanderer and other images from <i>Das Hummel-Buch</i> was insufficient because Seemann's heirs could not possibly have known for certain that Goebel was exploiting derivatives of the book. Cambridge maintains this is so because Goebel, if asked, would have denied that it was exploiting derivative works. The heirs, as with any other rights-holder with a potential claim, need not have obtained an admission of liability from Goebel in order for accrual to occur.</p>\n<p>[14]  The Cambridge complaint sufficiently invoked the district court's diversity jurisdiction, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1332, and thus does not depend on the existence <i>vel non</i> of federal-question jurisdiction. The jurisdictional analysis is relevant only to the question whether the claim is \"maintained\" under the Copy-right Act, <i>see infra</i> note 21, and thus subject to its three-year statute of limitations, rather than the applicable state-law limitations period.</p>\n<p>[15]  All the other cases cited by the majority are cut from this same cloth, and involve a straightforward holding that a claim which the plaintiff expressly denominates as a federal-law claim obviously must be said to \"arise under\" the federal statute that it invokes. <i>See </i><i>Santa-Rosa v.

Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709200\"><a href=\"/opinion/709200/alvan-h-wolf-v-reliance-standard-life-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 449 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that affirmative defenses normally are waived if not filed in initial responsive pleadings), has yet to deny the Cambridge allegation that Cambridge is a valid copyright co-owner (<i>via</i> descent and contract) of Seemann's original title, and has not produced a Rule 56 evidentiary proffer which would call the Seemann joint ownership into doubt. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, 120, 121 (1976), <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5736 (noting that co-ownership inquiry must focus on \"the intention at the time the writing is done that the parts be absorbed or combined into an integrated unit\"); <i>Thomson v.

Rather, Goebel simply maintains on appeal that the mere possibility of such a factual dispute satisfies the SFQ exception to the well-pleaded complaint. Goebel would face three considerable hurdles, however, if it were to pursue such a denial: (i) Das Hummelbuch, on its face, appears to be a unitary and fully integrated creation of artwork and poetry, <i>viz.,</i> a \"joint work\" as defined by § 101 and § 201(a), <i>see </i><i>Lulirama Ltd., Inc. v. Axcess Broad.

Latin Am. Music Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202883\"><a href=\"/opinion/202883/brown-v-latin-american-music-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2007) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 410(c) (\"In any judicial proceedings the certificate of a registration made before or within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate.\")); and (iii) any rebuttal of this presumption would depend on Goebel's proof of the contrary intention of persons long since deceased, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Stuart &amp; Sons, L.P. v.

Harms</i> test as merely \"the most frequently cited test,\" but finding no federal jurisdiction).</p>\n<p>[21]  Further evidence of a lack of congressional intention can be seen in the Copyright Act's statute-of-limitations provision. Rather than stating, in typical fashion, that the limitations period applies to all actions \"arising under\" the Act, the limitations apply only to those claims \"<i>maintained</i> under\" the Act. 17 U.S.C. § 507(b) (emphasis added); <i>see </i><i>Goodman,</i> 78 F.3d at 1013 (noting that even though state-law accounting claim arises under Copyright Act for jurisdictional purposes, the Act's three-year limitations period is not triggered, because the Act contains no remedy as between copyright co-owners, and thus the accounting claim cannot be said to be \"maintained\" under the Act, but instead is maintained under <i>state</i> law).</p>\n<p>[22]  Complete preemption, which is a jurisdictional principle, is distinct from normal \"conflict\" preemption, <i>see </i><i>SPGGC,</i> 488 F.3d at 530 n. 4, 534; <i>Bruneau v.

Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788940\"><a href=\"/opinion/788940/robert-ritchie-presently-known-as-kid-rock-top-dog-records-inc-and-kid/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span>, 287-88 (6th Cir.2005) (finding that Copyright Act completely preempts all state-law claims which are the <i>qualitative equivalent</i> of a copyright infringement suit); <i>Rosciszewski v.

In my view, Cambridge has demonstrated on appeal that several material factual disputes remain as to when its accounting claim accrued, thus precluding, as a matter of law, any Rule 56 determination of the accrual date. <i>See </i><i>Massey v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780022\"><a href=\"/opinion/780022/michael-massey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span>, 276 (7th Cir.2002) (\"Summary judgment is properly granted on the basis of a statute of limitations defense if . . . there exist no genuine issues of material fact regarding the time at which plaintiff's claim has accrued.\").</p>\n<p>[25]  The district court held, in the alternative, that even if the Copyright Act's three-year limitations period did not apply to the Cambridge accounting claim, the claim still would be governed by the state's three-year limitations period applicable to tort actions. This alternative holding is demonstrably wrong, for two reasons. First, Goebel would be estopped from asserting this argument by its previous statement, in its first appeal on the personal jurisdiction issue, that Cambridge \"does not assert a cause of action based on tortious activity either within or outside Massachusetts.\" <i>See </i><i>Cadle Co. v. Schlichtmann, Conway, Crowley &amp; Hugo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200582\"><a href=\"/opinion/200582/cadle-company-v-schlichtmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2003) (\"`We generally will not permit litigants to assert contradictory positions at different stages of a lawsuit in order to advance their interests.'\") (citation omitted). Second, the Cambridge accounting claim does not allege that Goebel wrongly retained or converted profits that it derived from Das Hummelbuch, nor could it do so because, as a co-owner of the copyrighted work, Goebel is free to use the copyright to its fullest. <i>See </i><i>Goodman,</i> 78 F.3d at 1012. Only once its co-owners make a suitable demand for an accounting would Goebel have an equitable duty to account to all of its co-owners for their respective shares of those profits. <i>See </i><i>Bacon v.
