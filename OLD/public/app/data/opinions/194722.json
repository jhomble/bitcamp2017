Bridget M.  Hayes, a  Chapter 7  debtor,\n          Per  Curiam.\n                     \n\ncommenced an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court whereby\n\nshe  strove to  annul the  trustee's public-auction  sale  of her\n\nresidence.  The debtor named  as defendants John L. Sullivan (the\n\nsuccessful   bidder)  and  James   Nagle  (who  had  subsequently\n\npurchased  the property  from Sullivan).    Following a  non-jury\n\ntrial,  the bankruptcy court (Kenner, J.) concluded that the sale\n\nhad been advertised \"widely and sufficiently\"; that no fewer than\n\nsix qualified bidders  attended the auction;  and that Hayes  had\n\nnot proven that the price realized at the auction sale ($110,000)\n\nwas grossly inadequate.  Based on these, and other, findings, the\n\nbankruptcy court dismissed Hayes's complaint.\n\n          On appeal,  the district court  (Keeton, J.)  affirmed.\n\nIn a  lengthy, thoughtful,  and comprehensive  opinion, Hayes  v.\n                                                             \n\nSullivan     F.  Supp.     (D. Mass. 1992)  [No. 92-12020-K], the\n        \n\ncourt  gave three  main reasons  for  its determination  that the\n\nbankruptcy court's judgment  must stand (any one  of which, taken\n\nalone, would have required affirmance of the judgment).\n\n          First,  the  court  held  that,  under the  controlling\n\nstatute, 11  U.S.C.   363(b)(1),  the results  of an  authorized,\n\ncompleted  auction sale  could be  set aside,  in the  absence of\n\n\"fraud, mistake, collusion or similar infirmity only on a showing\n\nof  gross inadequacy  of price.\"   Id. at      [slip op.  at 12].\n                                      \n\nBecause  Hayes  met neither  the standard's  fraud prong  nor its\n\nadequacy-of-price prong    Sullivan was  a good-faith  purchaser;\n\nplaintiff  conceded  the  absence of  fraud;  and  the bankruptcy\n\n                                2\n\njudge's finding as to the  adequacy of the price was  not clearly\n\nerroneous     the  district  court  found  that  the  appeal  was\n\ngroundless.\n\n          Second,  the court held that Hayes, in her presentation\n\nbefore the  bankruptcy court,  had urged the  court to  apply the\n\ngross inadequacy standard and had thereby waived any right to ask\n\nthe district court to invalidate the sale for some lesser reason.\n\nSee  id. at      [slip op.  at 15-16].   In other  words, Hayes's\n        \n\nargument that the  court should examine  the transaction under  a\n\ncriterion  more  searching  than gross  inadequacy  had  not been\n\npresented  face up  and  squarely in  the  bankruptcy court  and,\n\ntherefore, could not rewardingly be pressed on appeal.\n\n          Third, the  court ruled  that whether  it reviewed  the\n\noutcome  of this authorized  trustee's sale in  bankruptcy either\n\nunder  the gross  inadequacy  standard  or  the  totality-of-the-\n\ncircumstances standard pressed on appeal by Hayes, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's judgment must be affirmed.   See id. at     [slip op.  at\n                                            \n\n19-20].    This was  so because, even  if Hayes's newly  emergent\n\nview of  the governing  law was both  correct and  preserved, the\n\nfacts,  as supportably  found  by the  bankruptcy judge,  did not\n\nsustain her claim.\n\n          Given the district court's handiwork, we see no need to\n\nwrite at length.   Indeed, in cases  in which \"a trial  court has\n\nproduced a first-rate  work product, a reviewing  tribunal should\n\nhesitate to  wax  longiloquent  simply  to  hear  its  own  words\n\nresonate.\"  In  re San Juan Dupont  Plaza Hotel Fire  Litig.,    \n                                                            \n\n                                3\n\nF.2d     ,     (1st Cir. 1993) [No.  92-2216, slip op. at 4].  So\n\nit  is  here.   Whatever  the  relative  merits of  the  parties'\n\ncompeting views as  to the standard for setting aside authorized,\n\ncompleted trustees' sales under section  363(b)(1)   a matter  on\n\nwhich we express no opinion   it  is perfectly plain that, taking\n\nthe  totality-of-the-circumstances approach  urged by  appellant,\n\nand assuming arguendo that Hayes preserved this theory below, the\n                     \n\nfacts as found by the bankruptcy judge cannot  begin to carry the\n\nburden of  Hayes's case.   That  ends  the matter.   Because  the\n\ncritical findings of  fact are supported by  substantial evidence\n\nin the bankruptcy court record and are not clearly erroneous, the\n\njudgment  below must  be affirmed.   See, e.g., In  re Tully, 818\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  106,  108-110  (1st Cir.  1987)  (explicating  operation of\n\nclearly erroneous rule in bankruptcy cases); Bankr.
