Moore, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Cynthia A. Young,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           July 12, 2007\n\f              HOWARD, Circuit Judge.         Clive McFarlane was convicted of\n\none count of being a felon in possession of ammunition in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and was sentenced to 180 months of\n\nimprisonment.       McFarlane appeals, claiming that the district court\n\nerroneously denied his motion to suppress and committed several\n\ntrial   errors.          We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n              The government presented the following evidence at trial.\n\nJust before 7 p.m. on April 25, 2005, David Delehoy, a detective\n\nwith the Brockton, Massachusetts Police Department, was traveling\n\nthrough a high-crime section of Brockton on his way to work.                  While\n\nstopped at a traffic light, Detective Delehoy, who was dressed in\n\nplain clothes and driving an unmarked car, saw a group of people\n\nstanding      in    an    abandoned   parking    lot   and   heard    three    loud\n\nexplosions, which he thought were gun shots.\n\n              Detective Delehoy turned in the direction from which he\n\nthought the gun shots originated and saw a man sprinting away from\n\nthe   group    in    the    parking   lot.      He   followed   the   man,    later\n\nidentified as Antwone Moore, before losing sight of him behind\n\nseveral buildings.            After a few seconds, Delehoy again spotted\n\nMoore, this time walking rapidly.             At the same time, Delehoy also\n\nsaw a second male, later identified as Clive McFarlane, following\n\napproximately 100 feet behind Moore.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f              Delehoy   observed      Moore   looking    repeatedly      over   his\n\nshoulder at McFarlane.          Soon, Moore began running across another\n\nvacant lot.     Delehoy sped ahead, stopped his car at the end of the\n\nlot, and asked Moore if he needed help or a ride.             Delehoy left his\n\ncar, identified himself as a police officer, showed his badge to\n\nMoore, and ordered him to show his hands.                 Moore, who appeared\n\nrelieved by Delehoy's presence, said that McFarlane was trying to\n\nshoot him.\n\n              Delehoy then saw McFarlane approach a set of trash cans\n\nalong   the     path    Moore   had    traveled.        Delehoy,   who    had   an\n\nunobstructed view of McFarlane, saw him remove a liner from the\n\ntrash can, lean into the can with both arms, and stand up to\n\nreplace the liner.         This led Delehoy to believe that McFarlane\n\nmight have put something in the can.            Delehoy, with his gun drawn\n\nand badge displayed, moved toward McFarlane and ordered him to\n\nraise his hands and get down on the ground.                 McFarlane shouted\n\nprofanity at Delehoy but complied with the order.              Delehoy called\n\nfor help and remained several feet from McFarlane until another\n\nofficer arrived.\n\n              Seconds later, Officer Robert Smith arrived on the scene\n\nand, at Delehoy's command, handcuffed McFarlane.              After McFarlane\n\nwas handcuffed, Delehoy went to the trash can into which McFarlane\n\nhad reached.     He removed the liner and found a revolver containing\n\nsix spent ammunition cases.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f                 At trial, McFarlane testified in his own defense.                       He\n\nstated       that      he    and    Moore   had   a   physical    altercation      in   the\n\nabandoned parking lot, during which Moore attempted to shoot him\n\nwith the revolver that was later found in the trash can.                      McFarlane\n\nexplained that Moore then fled, but McFarlane followed, stopping to\n\nlook in the trash can out of curiosity.\n\n                                               II.\n\n                 A.          Motion to Suppress\n\n                 Prior to trial, McFarlane filed a motion to suppress,\n\nclaiming         that       his    detention    and     arrest   violated    the   Fourth\n\nAmendment to the Constitution because there was neither probable\n\ncause for the arrest nor reasonable suspicion for the detention.\n\nAfter       an   evidentiary         hearing,1    the    district    court   denied     the\n\nmotion, concluding that there was reasonable suspicion to detain\n\nMcFarlane for an investigative stop under Terry v. Ohio, 389 U.S.\n\n950 (1967), and that Delehoy permissibly ordered McFarlane to the\n\nground because he may have been dangerous.\n\n                 In considering the denial of a motion to suppress, we\n\nreview       questions of law de novo and factual findings for clear\n\nerror, see United States v. Vongkaysone, 434 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir.\n\n2006),       and      will    affirm    the    district    court's   decision      if   any\n\nreasonable view of the evidence supports it, see United States v.\n\n\n\n        1\n      The evidence presented at the hearing was identical in all\nmaterial respects to the trial evidence described earlier.\n\n                                               -4-\n\fGarcia,   983    F.2d     1160,   1167   (1st   Cir.   1993).     In   resolving\n\nMcFarlane's challenge, we bypass the district court's Terry stop\n\nanalysis because we conclude, in accord with the government's\n\nalternative position, that Delehoy had probable cause to arrest\n\nMcFarlane at the moment he ordered him to the ground.2\n\n            An arrest does not contravene the Fourth Amendment's\n\nprohibition on unreasonable seizures so long as the arrest is\n\nsupported by probable cause. See United States v. Fiasconaro, 315\n\nF.3d 28, 35 (1st Cir. 2002).             \"Probable cause exists when police\n\nofficers,       relying     on     reasonably     trustworthy       facts      and\n\ncircumstances, have information upon which a reasonably prudent\n\nperson would believe the suspect committed or was committing a\n\ncrime.\"   United States v. Burhoe, 409 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThe inquiry into probable cause to support an arrest focuses on\n\nwhat the officer knew at the time of the arrest, and should\n\nevaluate the totality of the circumstances.              See United States v.\n\nJones, 432 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            McFarlane contends that there was no basis for his arrest\n\nwhen Delehoy ordered him to the ground because at that point the\n\nonly information available to Delehoy was Moore's uncorroborated\n\nstatement that McFarlane had tried to shoot him.                We disagree.\n\n\n\n     2\n      In resolving McFarlane's challenge on the basis of probable\ncause, we do not mean to imply that the district court's analysis\nwas incorrect but only that probable cause provides a more\nstraightforward ground for affirmance.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f              When Delehoy made the arrest, he had substantially more\n\ninformation than Moore's word that a crime had taken place. Before\n\nthe arrest, Delehoy heard several gun shots from a close distance\n\nand then observed McFarlane following Moore in what appeared to be\n\na chase.      He saw Moore sprinting away from McFarlane and looking\n\nback over his shoulder several times to check on McFarlane's\n\ndistance.     He also saw what he thought was McFarlane's attempt to\n\nhide an object in a trash can by removing a liner, placing both\n\nhands in the can, and then replacing the liner.           See United States\n\nv. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 198-99 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that\n\nsuspicious maneuvers are relevant to the probable cause inquiry).\n\n              After watching the chase, Delehoy stopped Moore and\n\nidentified himself as a police officer. Moore appeared relieved by\n\nthe   presence     of   a   police   officer   and   informed   Delehoy   that\n\nMcFarlane had tried to shoot him.\n\n              A statement from a source can constitute the basis for\n\nprobable cause, even if the source is previously unknown to the\n\nofficer, so long as there is a sufficient basis for crediting the\n\nsource's reliability.         See Vongkaysone, 434 F.3d at 71.            Here,\n\nthere   was    a   sufficient    basis   for   Delehoy   to   credit   Moore's\n\nstatement. Moore made the statement to Delehoy face-to-face, which\n\nsupports    the    statement's   reliability    because   the   face-to-face\n\nnature of the encounter permitted Delehoy to observe Moore's\n\napparent relief when he realized that a police officer was present.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fThis conduct was consistent with Moore's claim that someone was\n\ntrying to shoot him.         See United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 73\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (\"A face-to-face encounter provides police officers\n\nthe opportunity to perceive and evaluate personally an informant's\n\nmannerisms, expressions and tone of voice and, thus, to assess the\n\ninformant's veracity more readily . . . .\").                     The nature of the\n\nencounter also allowed Delehoy to learn Moore's identity and\n\nappearance so he could hold him responsible if the information\n\nprovided later turned out to be false.                   See Florida v. J.L., 529\n\nU.S.    266,    270-71    (2000).        Furthermore,      after    Moore     made    the\n\nstatement, Delehoy saw McFarlane appear to hide something in the\n\ntrash    can,    which    was    consistent       with   Moore's    assertion        that\n\nMcFarlane had tried to shoot him.                See United States v. Greenburg,\n\n410    F.3d    63,   68   (1st    Cir.   2005)     (stating      that    an   officer's\n\nobservation of conduct consistent with the informant's tip supports\n\nthe tip's veracity).\n\n               In sum, Delehoy saw a chase between two men after hearing\n\ngun shots and then learned from one participant of the chase that\n\nthe other had tried to shoot him.                 The circumstances under which\n\nMoore made this statement to Delehoy supported its veracity, as did\n\nMcFarlane's       peculiar       conduct    in     going    to     the    trash      can.\n\n\"[P]robable cause is a 'common sense, nontechnical conception[]\n\nthat deal[s] with the factual and practical considerations of\n\neveryday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\ftechnicians, act.'\" United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 198 n.11\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690,\n\n695 (1996) (alterations in original; internal quotation marks and\n\nadditional citation omitted)).         Under this standard, we conclude\n\nthat Delehoy had probable cause to arrest McFarlane after he saw\n\nhim go into the trash can.      The motion to suppress was correctly\n\ndenied.\n\n          B.      Jury Instructions\n\n          McFarlane also challenges two aspects of the district\n\ncourt's jury instructions. First, he claims that the court did not\n\nadequately   explain   the   concept    of   constructive   possession   as\n\napplied to this case, and second, he challenges the district\n\ncourt's instruction concerning the significance of his indictment\n\nin the jury deliberations.\n\n          We discern no abuse of discretion in the form of the\n\nconstructive possession instruction.          After determining that the\n\nfacts could permit a guilty verdict under either an actual or\n\nconstructive possession theory, the district court provided the\n\nfollowing instruction concerning constructive possession:\n\n          [C]onstructive possession means power -- the\n          power and intention at any given time to\n          exercise control or dominion of the object.\n          Let me give you an example. If my son asks me\n          to take his car to the repair shop, I'm\n          driving it to the repair place. I have actual\n          possession of the car. I get there, I turn the\n          car over to the repair people. At that point,\n          they have actual possession of the car. I have\n          constructive possession. I intend that they do\n\n                             -8-\n\f           certain things with the car, and I have the\n           ability to take it away if I want to. So that\n           is called constructive possession. The repair\n           people have actual possession until such time\n           as they're done with the car and I pick it up\n           again.\n                                * * *\n           Now, understand that ownership is not required\n           with respect to possession. So that's why I\n           carefully told you I was taking my son's car.\n           He's the owner.    I have possession while I\n           take it there. Once I give it to the repair\n           people, they have actual possession. I have\n           constructive possession.      So ownership is\n           wholly irrelevant to this. Now, possession,\n           where it's actual or constructive, does not\n           have to be continuous, nor does it have to be\n           for any particular length of time, even a short\n           period is enough.\n\n           McFarlane   objected   to    the   constructive   possession\n\ninstruction, asserting that it improperly permitted the jury to\n\nconvict on a constructive possession theory, even if the jury\n\nbelieved his testimony that he merely found the gun in the trash\n\ncan.   The court overruled the objection.\n\n           During deliberations, the jury submitted two questions to\n\nthe district court concerning constructive possession.        The jury\n\nasked (1) \"Does looking for the gun constitute intent to exercise\n\ncontrol and dominion over the gun?\" and (2) \"Does opening the trash\n\nbag, with the intent to find the gun, which is indeed there,\n\nconstitute putting himself in the position to have the power to\n\nexercise control and dominion over the gun?\"        After a discussion\n\nwith counsel, the court determined that providing specific answers\n\nto these questions would be inappropriate because the answers could\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fbe interpreted by the jury as providing the court's view as to what\n\nthe   evidence   demonstrated.      Instead,    the   court   provided   the\n\nfollowing, more general, supplemental instruction:\n\n           The very short answer to that is that it is for\n           you to decide each of these questions. As I\n           told you, possession requires, and you clearly\n           understand this, both the ability and intention\n           to take physical control of an object. You are\n           asking me to decide whether a particular act by\n           itself constitutes intent to exercise control\n           and whether . . . doing something with that\n           intent then puts the defendant in the position\n           of having the power to exercise control.\n\n                              * * *\n           And all I can tell you is that you need to look\n           at all of the evidence of what occurred. You\n           need to look -- particularly with respect to\n           intent -- you need to look at everything the\n           defendant did, at everything he said, and the\n           circumstances that existed at the time that he\n           acted and spoke and decide from all of that\n           whether he had the intent at a particular point\n           in time that you're considering to exercise\n           control over the object.\n\n                                 * * *\n\n           And similarly, with respect to his ability, his\n           power to exercise control, you need to look at\n           the whole thing and then you need to decide.\n           I can't [tell you] whether he did indeed have\n           the power to exercise control.     You need to\n           look at all the facts that existed at the\n           particular moment in time and decide that\n           question.\n\n           McFarlane asserts that this instruction was erroneous and\n\nprejudicial because it did not describe to the jury the way in\n\nwhich the definition of constructive possession related to the\n\nspecific facts of this case.             In particular, in light of his\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fcontention that he just happened upon the ammunition when looking\n\ninto the trash can (and his view that the jury questions at least\n\nsuggested that they accepted this theory), he argues that the\n\ndistrict court should have instructed that \"mere curiosity . . .\n\ncoupled with a direct look at the gun that held the subject\n\nammunition, does not establish constructive possession of the\n\nammunition.\"\n\n             Because this challenge concerns the form and wording of\n\nthe    instructions,      we   review    them    for    abuse    of   discretion.\n\nSee United States v. Tom, 330 F.3d 83,                 91 (1st Cir. 2003).    In\n\nformulating jury instructions, a district court is not required \"to\n\nparrot the language proffered by the parties.\"                  United States v.\n\nGlaum, 356 F.3d 169, 178 (1st Cir. 2004).              Within wide margins, the\n\ndistrict court maintains discretion in the precise manner that it\n\nexplains legal concepts to the jury.                   Id.   We consider only\n\n\"whether, taken as a whole, the court's instructions fairly and\n\nadequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.\"                Tom, 330\n\nF.3d at 91.\n\n             The   constructive     possession         instruction    accurately\n\ndescribed the elements required for a conviction under this theory.\n\nAs    they   indicated,    a   conviction       for    constructive    possession\n\nrequires proof that a \"person knowingly has the power and intention\n\nat a given time to exercise dominion over an object . . . .\"\n\nUnited States v. Gobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 2006).                   The\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fdistrict     court    also   provided     a    cogent,      everyday    example     of\n\nconstructive possession to aid the jury's understanding. The court\n\ndecided, however, not to apply the definition of constructive\n\npossession    to     the   facts   of   the    case   for    fear    that   such    an\n\ninstruction would interfere with the jury's fact finding role.\n\n             This fear was warranted.            \"[T]hough a trial court is\n\npermitted to marshal the evidence for the jury and, if it chooses,\n\nto comment on it, the court is not permitted to impose its own\n\nopinions on the jury or present its own theories when they are not\n\nstrongly grounded in the evidence.\"             Ostrowiski v. Atl. Mut. Ins.\n\nCos., 968 F.2d 171, 185 (2d Cir. 1992).               Here, the main dispute at\n\ntrial was over McFarlane's intent in going into the trash can.                     The\n\ncourt was properly concerned that describing various versions of\n\nthe facts (and the intentions that might be inferred from them),\n\nand   then    instructing     whether     a    conviction      for     constructive\n\npossession was warranted under each particular version, would\n\nintrude on the jury's function to find the facts and draw the\n\ninferences from them.          Under these circumstances, the district\n\ncourt's concern was reasonable.          The court therefore did not abuse\n\nits discretion by rejecting the more specific instructions sought\n\nby McFarlane.\n\n             McFarlane's second challenge to the jury instructions\n\nconcerns the instruction on the appropriate use of the indictment.\n\nThe court told the jury:\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f          Now, the only other thing I want to mention is\n          that you will have with you in the jury room a\n          copy of the indictment.    Understand, again,\n          that the indictment is nothing more than the\n          accusation. It is the document that contains\n          the accusation. It is not evidence of guilt,\n          it is not proof of guilt. It is simply the\n          accusation, and you should not use it in\n          determining whether the government has proven\n          him guilty or not.\n\n                             * * *\n\n          It is a judgment by an earlier, larger jury\n          that there's probable cause to believe the\n          witness -- that the defendant did this, but it\n          is not evidence of guilt, it is not proof of\n          guilt. Indeed, the defendant is, under the\n          Constitution and laws of this country, entitled\n          to what we call the presumption of innocence.\n          But effectively, that means that he is innocent\n          until the government proves him guilty beyond\n          a reasonable doubt.       And because he is\n          innocent, he doesn't have to prove his\n          innocence. (Emphasis added.)\n\nMcFarlane claims that the statement that a larger jury (i.e., the\n\ngrand jury) had heard the matter and concluded that there was\n\nprobable cause to believe that he had committed the crime was\n\nprejudicial because it misled the petit jury into believing that\n\nthe case already had been resolved against him.        McFarlane did not\n\nobject to this instruction before the district court, however, and\n\ntherefore we review it for plain error only.         See United States v.\n\nGonzales-Velez, 466 F.3d 27, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Under plain error review, the defendant must show a clear\n\nerror that affected his substantial rights and undermined the\n\nintegrity,   fairness   or   public     reputation     of   the   judicial\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fproceedings.        See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 77\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).          McFarlane does not prevail under this \"demanding\n\nstandard.\"         United States v. Colon Osorio, 360 F.3d 48, 51 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n                   It is long settled in this circuit that \"subject to a\n\nproper covering instruction, whether the indictment should be given\n\nto   the    jury    for    use   during    its    deliberations    is   within   the\n\ndiscretion of the trial court.\"              United States v. Medina, 761 F.2d\n\n12, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1985).            The district court's statement        that a\n\n\"larger jury\" had found probable cause, if considered in isolation,\n\ncould mislead a petit jury into according significance to the grand\n\njury's      action.       But    we   do   not    review   jury   instructions   in\n\nisolation; we review the charge as a whole.                 See United States v.\n\nDeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1317 (1st Cir. 1994).                The charge read in its\n\nentirety made it clear that the indictment was not evidence of\n\nguilt.      The court instructed the jury that the indictment was only\n\nan accusation that could not be used as proof of guilt and that the\n\ndefendant enjoyed a presumption of innocence at all times. Indeed,\n\nthe instruction given here is similar to a covering instruction\n\nthat we approved as adequate to guard against the jury’s using the\n\nindictment as evidence.           See United States v. Glantz, 847 F.2d 1,\n\n10-11 (1st Cir. 1988).3           There was no plain error.\n\n\n      3\n          The instruction in Glantz stated:\n\n              You must understand the effect of an\n\n                                           -14-\n\f          C. The \"A/K/A\" Portion of the Indictment\n\n          Finally, McFarlane claims that the indictment submitted\n\nto the jury was prejudicial because it included an alias.                  The\n\nindictment   charged    \"Clive    McFarlane,     a/k/a    Clive   McFarland.\"\n\nMcFarlane claims that it was prejudicial error for the alias not to\n\nbe removed from the indictment before it was submitted to the jury.\n\nHe asserts that the alias had nothing to do with the case and\n\ntherefore it prejudiced the jury's deliberation to learn of the\n\nalias.   McFarlane did not preserve this objection below, and thus\n\nour review is again limited to plain error.\n\n          Where   the    use     of   an     alias   is   important   to   the\n\ngovernment's case, its submission to the jury as part of the\n\nindictment is permissible.       See United States v. Candelaria-Silva,\n\n166 F.3d 19, 33 (1st Cir. 1999).              But this practice has been\n\ndiscouraged where the alias is irrelevant.           E.g., United States v.\n\nWilkerson, 456 F.2d 57, 59 (6th Cir. 1972).               Even assuming that\n\nallowing the indictment to go to the jury without redacting the\n\nalias was plain error,      McFarlane has not demonstrated that the\n\n\n\n          indictment.   It is only an accusation.   The\n          fact that it has been brought is totally\n          meaningless so far as your task is concerned.\n          It may not be the basis of any suggestion of\n          guilt.   All that it does is to bring this\n          matter before you for your determination.\n          Beyond that, it has no significance whatever\n          from the point of view of guilt or innocence.\n\nId.\n\n                                      -15-\n\ferror affected his substantial rights.           The indictment was not\n\nreferenced by the government during the trial or by the court in\n\nits instructions.       Indeed, at no point was the alias brought to the\n\njury's attention.       See People v. Romero, 694 P.2d 1256, 1268 (Col.\n\n1985) (finding no plain error under similar facts).                In these\n\ncircumstances, it would be pure speculation to conclude that the\n\nlisting   of   the   alias    in   the   indictment   had   any   effect   on\n\ndeliberations.       Such speculation is insufficient to ground a\n\nsuccessful claim that a clear error affected the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights.       See generally Anontakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 78\n\n(observing that, even under the most permissive articulation of the\n\nplain error standard by the Supreme Court, the defendant must show\n\na \"reasonable probability\" that the error affected the outcome of\n\nthe district court proceeding in order to demonstrate an effect on\n\nsubstantial rights).\n\n                                     III.\n\n            For   the    reasons   stated,   McFarlane's    conviction     is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

McFarlane appeals, claiming that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress and committed several trial errors. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government presented the following evidence at trial. Just before 7 p.m. on April 25, 2005, David Delehoy, a detective with the Brockton, Massachusetts Police Department, was traveling through a high-crime section of Brockton on his way to work. While stopped at a traffic light, Detective Delehoy, who was dressed in plain clothes and driving an unmarked car, saw a group of people standing in an abandoned parking lot and heard three loud explosions, which he thought were gun shots.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective Delehoy turned in the direction from which he thought the gun shots originated and saw a man sprinting away from the group in the parking lot. He followed the man, later identified as Antwone Moore, before losing sight of him behind several buildings. After a few seconds, Delehoy again spotted Moore, this time walking rapidly. At the same time, Delehoy also saw a second male, later identified as Clive McFarlane, following approximately 100 feet behind Moore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delehoy observed Moore looking repeatedly over his shoulder at McFarlane. Soon, Moore began running across another vacant lot. Delehoy sped ahead, stopped his car at the end of the lot, and asked Moore if he needed help or a ride. Delehoy left his car, identified himself as a police officer, showed his badge to Moore, and ordered him to show his hands. Moore, who appeared relieved by Delehoy's presence, said that McFarlane was trying to shoot him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delehoy then saw McFarlane approach a set of trash cans along the path Moore had traveled. Delehoy, who had an unobstructed view of McFarlane, saw him remove a liner from the trash can, lean into the can with both arms, and stand up to replace the liner. This led Delehoy to believe that McFarlane might have put something in the can. Delehoy, with his gun drawn and badge displayed, moved toward McFarlane and ordered him to raise his hands and get down on the ground. McFarlane shouted profanity at Delehoy but complied with the order. Delehoy called for help and remained several feet from McFarlane until another officer arrived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seconds later, Officer Robert Smith arrived on the scene and, at Delehoy's command, handcuffed McFarlane. After McFarlane was handcuffed, Delehoy went to the trash can into which McFarlane had reached. He removed the liner and found a revolver containing six spent ammunition cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, McFarlane testified in his own defense. He stated that he and Moore had a physical altercation in the abandoned parking lot, during which Moore attempted to shoot him with the revolver that was later found in the trash can. McFarlane explained that Moore then fled, but McFarlane followed, stopping to look in the trash can out of curiosity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, McFarlane filed a motion to suppress, claiming that his detention and arrest violated the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution because there was neither probable cause for the arrest nor reasonable suspicion for the detention. After an evidentiary hearing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the district court denied the motion, concluding that there was reasonable suspicion to detain McFarlane for an investigative stop under <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 389 U.S. 950, 88 S.Ct. 313, 19 L.Ed.2d 358 (1967), and that Delehoy permissibly ordered McFarlane to the ground because he may have been dangerous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the denial of a motion to suppress, we review questions of law de novo and factual findings for clear error, <i>see United States v. Vongkaysone,</i> 434 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir.2006), and will affirm the district court's decision if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it, <i>see United States v. Garcia,</i> 983 F.2d 1160, 1167 (1st Cir.1993). In resolving McFarlane's challenge, we bypass the district court's <i>Terry</i> stop analysis because we conclude, in accord with the government's alternative position, that Delehoy had probable cause to arrest McFarlane at the moment he ordered him to the ground.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An arrest does not contravene the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable seizures so long as the arrest is supported by probable cause. <i>See United States v. Fiasconaro,</i> 315 F.3d 28, 35 (1st Cir.2002). \"Probable cause exists when police officers, relying on reasonably trustworthy facts and circumstances, have information upon which a reasonably prudent person would believe the suspect committed or was committing a crime.\" <i>United States v. Burhoe,</i> 409 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.2005). The inquiry into probable cause to support an arrest focuses on what the officer knew at the time of the arrest, and should evaluate the totality of the circumstances. <i>See United States v. Jones,</i> 432 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane contends that there was no basis for his arrest when Delehoy ordered him to the ground because at that point the only information available to Delehoy was Moore's uncorroborated statement that McFarlane had tried to shoot him. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Delehoy made the arrest, he had substantially more information than Moore's word that a crime had taken place. Before the arrest, Delehoy heard several gun shots from a close distance and then observed McFarlane following Moore in what appeared to be a chase. He saw Moore sprinting away from McFarlane and looking back over his shoulder several times to check on McFarlane's distance. He also saw what he thought was McFarlane's attempt to hide an object in a trash can by removing a liner, placing both hands in the can, and then replacing the liner. <i>See United States v. Meade,</i> 110 F.3d 190, 198-99 (1st Cir.1997) (noting that suspicious maneuvers are relevant to the probable cause inquiry).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After watching the chase, Delehoy stopped Moore and identified himself as a police officer. Moore appeared relieved by the presence of a police officer and informed Delehoy that McFarlane had tried to shoot him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A statement from a source can constitute the basis for probable cause, even if the source is previously unknown to the officer, so long as there is a sufficient basis for crediting the source's reliability. <i>See Vongkaysone,</i> 434 F.3d at 71. Here, there was a sufficient basis for Delehoy to credit Moore's statement. Moore made the statement to Delehoy face-to-face, which supports the statement's reliability because the face-to-face nature of the encounter permitted Delehoy to observe Moore's apparent relief when he realized that a police officer was present. This conduct was consistent with Moore's claim that someone was trying to shoot him. <i>See United States v. Romain,</i> 393 F.3d 63, 73 (1st Cir.2004) (\"A face-to-face encounter provides police officers the opportunity to perceive and evaluate personally an informant's mannerisms, expressions and tone of voice and, thus, to assess the informant's veracity more readily . . . .\"). The nature of the encounter also allowed Delehoy to learn Moore's identity and appearance so he could hold him responsible if the information provided later turned out to be false. <i>See Florida v. J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. 266, 270-71, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000). Furthermore, after Moore made the statement, Delehoy saw McFarlane appear to hide something in the trash can, which was consistent with Moore's assertion that McFarlane had tried to shoot him. <i>See United States v. Greenburg,</i> 410 F.3d 63, 68 (1st Cir.2005) (stating that an officer's observation of conduct consistent with the informant's tip supports the tip's veracity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Delehoy saw a chase between two men after hearing gun shots and then learned from one participant of the chase that the other had tried to shoot him. The circumstances under which Moore made this statement to Delehoy supported its veracity, as did McFarlane's peculiar conduct in going to the trash can. \"[P]robable cause is a `common sense, nontechnical conception[] that deal[s] with the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.'\" <i>United States v. Meade,</i> 110 F.3d 190, 198 n. 11 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting <i>Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 695, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (alterations in original; internal quotation marks and additional citation omitted)). Under this standard, we conclude that Delehoy had probable cause to arrest McFarlane after he saw him go into the trash can. The motion to suppress was correctly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane also challenges two aspects of the district court's jury instructions. First, he claims that the court did not adequately explain the concept of constructive possession as applied to this case, and second, he challenges the district court's instruction concerning the significance of his indictment in the jury deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the form of the constructive possession instruction. After determining that the facts could permit a guilty verdict under either an actual or constructive possession theory, the district court provided the following instruction concerning constructive possession:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[C]onstructive possession means power &#8212; the power and intention at any given time to exercise control or dominion of the object. Let me give you an example. If my son asks me to take his car to the repair shop, I'm driving it to the repair place. I have actual possession of the car. I get there, I turn the car over to the repair people. At that point, they have actual possession of the car. I have constructive possession. I intend that they do certain things with the car, and I have the ability to take it away if I want to. So that is called constructive possession. The repair people have actual possession until such time as they're done with the car and I pick it up again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, understand that ownership is not required with respect to possession. So that's why I carefully told you I was taking my son's car. He's the owner. I have possession while I take it there. Once I give it to the repair people, they have actual possession. I have constructive possession. So ownership is wholly irrelevant to this. Now, possession, where it's actual or constructive, does not have to be continuous, nor does it have to be for any particular length of time, even a short period is enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane objected to the constructive possession instruction, asserting that it improperly permitted the jury to convict on a constructive possession theory, even if the jury believed his testimony that he merely found the gun in the trash can. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During deliberations, the jury submitted two questions to the district court concerning constructive possession. The jury asked (1) \"Does looking for the gun constitute <i>intent</i> to exercise control and dominion over the gun?\" and (2) \"Does opening the trash bag, with the intent to find the gun, which is indeed there, constitute putting himself in the position to have the <i>power</i> to exercise control and dominion over the gun?\" After a discussion with counsel, the court determined that providing specific answers to these questions would be inappropriate because the answers could be interpreted by the jury as providing the court's view as to what the evidence demonstrated. Instead, the court provided the following, more general, supplemental instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The very short answer to that is that it is for you to decide each of these questions. As I told you, possession requires, and you clearly understand this, both the ability and intention to take physical control of an object. You are asking me to decide whether a particular act by itself constitutes intent to exercise control and whether . . . doing something with that intent then puts the defendant in the position of having the power to exercise control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And all I can tell you is that you need to look at all of the evidence of what occurred. You need to look &#8212; particularly with respect to intent &#8212; you need to look at everything the defendant did, at everything he said, and the circumstances that existed at the time that he acted and spoke and decide from all of that whether he had the intent at a particular point in time that you're considering to exercise control over the object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And similarly, with respect to his ability, his power to exercise control, you need to look at the whole thing and then you need to decide. I can't [tell you] whether he did indeed have the power to exercise control. You need to look at all the facts that existed at the particular moment in time and decide that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane asserts that this instruction was erroneous and prejudicial because it did not describe to the jury the way in which the definition of constructive possession related to the specific facts of this case. In particular, in light of his contention that he just happened upon the ammunition when looking into the trash can (and his view that the jury questions at least suggested that they accepted this theory), he argues that the district court should have instructed that \"mere curiosity . . . coupled with a direct look at the gun that held the subject ammunition, does not establish constructive possession of the ammunition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this challenge concerns the form and wording of the instructions, we review them for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 91 (1st Cir.2003). In formulating jury instructions, a district court is not required \"to parrot the language proffered by the parties.\" <i>United States v. Glaum,</i> 356 F.3d 169, 178 (1st Cir.2004). Within wide margins, the district court maintains discretion in the precise manner that it explains legal concepts to the jury. <i>Id.</i> We consider only \"whether, taken as a whole, the court's instructions fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.\" <i>Tom,</i> 330 F.3d at 91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constructive possession instruction accurately described the elements required for a conviction under this theory. As they indicated, a conviction for constructive possession requires proof that a \"person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion over an object . . . .\" <i>United States v. Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d 302, 309 (1st Cir.2006). The district court also provided a cogent, everyday example of constructive possession to aid the jury's understanding. The court decided, however, not to apply the definition of constructive possession to the facts of the case for fear that such an instruction would interfere with the jury's fact finding role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This fear was warranted. \"[T]hough a trial court is permitted to marshal the evidence for the jury and, if it chooses, to comment on it, the court is not permitted to impose its own opinions on the jury or present its own theories when they are not strongly grounded in the evidence.\" <i>Ostrowski v. Atl. Mut. Ins. Cos.,</i> 968 F.2d 171, 185 (2d Cir.1992). Here, the main dispute at trial was over McFarlane's intent in going into the trash can. The court was properly concerned that describing various versions of the facts (and the intentions that might be inferred from them), and then instructing whether a conviction for constructive possession was warranted under each particular version, would intrude on the jury's function to find the facts and draw the inferences from them. Under these circumstances, the district court's concern was reasonable. The court therefore did not abuse its discretion by rejecting the more specific instructions sought by McFarlane.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane's second challenge to the jury instructions concerns the instruction on the appropriate use of the indictment. The court told the jury: Now, the only other thing I want to mention is that you will have with you in the jury room a copy of the indictment. Understand, again, that the indictment is nothing more than the accusation. It is the document that contains the accusation. It is not evidence of guilt, it is not proof of guilt. It is simply the accusation, and you should not use it in determining whether the government has proven him guilty or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>It is a judgment by an earlier, larger jury that there's probable cause to believe the witness &#8212; that the defendant did this,</i> but it is not evidence of guilt, it is not proof of guilt. Indeed, the defendant is, under the Constitution and laws of this country, entitled to what we call the presumption of innocence. But effectively, that means that he is innocent until the government proves him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And because he is innocent, he doesn't have to prove his innocence. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane claims that the statement that a larger jury (<i>i.e.,</i> the grand jury) had heard the matter and concluded that there was probable cause to believe that he had committed the crime was prejudicial because it misled the petit jury into believing that the case already had been resolved against him. McFarlane did not object to this instruction before the district court, however, and therefore we review it for plain error only. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez-Velez,</i> 466 F.3d 27, 34-35 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under plain error review, the defendant must show a clear error that affected his substantial rights and undermined the integrity, fairness or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir.2005). McFarlane does not prevail under this \"demanding standard.\" <i>United States v. Colon Osorio,</i> 360 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is long settled in this circuit that \"subject to a proper covering instruction, whether the indictment should be given to the jury for use during its deliberations is within the discretion of the trial court.\" <i>United States v. Medina,</i> 761 F.2d 12, 21-22 (1st Cir.1985). The district court's statement that a \"larger jury\" had found probable cause, if considered in isolation, could mislead a petit jury into according significance to the grand jury's action. But we do not review jury instructions in isolation; we review the charge as a whole. <i>See United States v. DeMasi,</i> 40 F.3d 1306, 1317 (1st Cir.1994). The charge read in its entirety made it clear that the indictment was not evidence of guilt. The court instructed the jury that the indictment was only an accusation that could not be used as proof of guilt and that the defendant enjoyed a presumption of innocence at all times. Indeed, the instruction given here is similar to a covering instruction that we approved as adequate to guard against the jury's using the indictment as evidence. <i>See United States v. Glantz,</i> 847 F.2d 1, 10-11 (1st Cir.1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> There was no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The \"A/K/A\" Portion of the Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McFarlane claims that the indictment submitted to the jury was prejudicial because it included an alias. The indictment charged \"Clive McFarlane, a/k/a Clive McFarland.\" McFarlane claims that it was prejudicial error for the alias not to be removed from the indictment before it was submitted to the jury. He asserts that the alias had nothing to do with the case and therefore it prejudiced the jury's deliberation to learn of the alias. McFarlane did not preserve this objection below, and thus our review is again limited to plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the use of an alias is important to the government's case, its submission to the jury as part of the indictment is permissible. <i>See United States v. Candelaria-Silva,</i> 166 F.3d 19, 33 (1st Cir. 1999). But this practice has been discouraged where the alias is irrelevant. <i>E.g., United States v. Wilkerson,</i> 456 F.2d 57, 59 (6th Cir.1972). Even assuming that allowing the indictment to go to the jury without redacting the alias was plain error, McFarlane has not demonstrated that the error affected his substantial rights. The indictment was not referenced by the government during the trial or by the court in its instructions. Indeed, at no point was the alias brought to the jury's attention. <i>See People v. Romero,</i> 694 P.2d 1256, 1268 (Colo.1985) (finding no plain error under similar facts). In these circumstances, it would be pure speculation to conclude that the listing of the alias in the indictment had any effect on deliberations. Such speculation is insufficient to ground a successful claim that a clear error affected the defendant's substantial rights. <i>See generally Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 78 (observing that, even under the most permissive articulation of the plain error standard by the Supreme Court, the defendant must show a \"reasonable probability\" that the error affected the outcome of the district court proceeding in order to demonstrate an effect on substantial rights).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, McFarlane's conviction is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The evidence presented at the hearing was identical in all material respects to the trial evidence described earlier</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In resolving McFarlane's challenge on the basis of probable cause, we do not mean to imply that the district court's analysis was incorrect but only that probable cause provides a more straightforward ground for affirmance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The instruction in<i>Glantz</i> stated:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">You must understand the effect of an indictment.

Just before 7 p.m. on April 25, 2005, David Delehoy, a detective with the Brockton, Massachusetts Police Department, was traveling through a high-crime section of Brockton on his way to work. While stopped at a traffic light, Detective Delehoy, who was dressed in plain clothes and driving an unmarked car, saw a group of people standing in an abandoned parking lot and heard three loud explosions, which he thought were gun shots.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective Delehoy turned in the direction from which he thought the gun shots originated and saw a man sprinting away from the group in the parking lot. He followed the man, later identified as Antwone Moore, before losing sight of him behind several buildings. After a few seconds, Delehoy again spotted Moore, this time walking rapidly. At the same time, Delehoy also saw a second male, later identified as Clive McFarlane, following approximately 100 feet behind Moore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delehoy observed Moore looking repeatedly over his shoulder at McFarlane. Soon, Moore began running across another vacant lot. Delehoy sped ahead, stopped his car at the end of the lot, and asked Moore if he needed help or a ride. Delehoy left his car, identified himself as a police officer, showed his badge to Moore, and ordered him to show his hands. Moore, who appeared relieved by Delehoy's presence, said that McFarlane was trying to shoot him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delehoy then saw McFarlane approach a set of trash cans along the path Moore had traveled. Delehoy, who had an unobstructed view of McFarlane, saw him remove a liner from the trash can, lean into the can with both arms, and stand up to replace the liner. This led Delehoy to believe that McFarlane might have put something in the can. Delehoy, with his gun drawn and badge displayed, moved toward McFarlane and ordered him to raise his hands and get down on the ground. McFarlane shouted profanity at Delehoy but complied with the order. Delehoy called for help and remained several feet from McFarlane until another officer arrived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seconds later, Officer Robert Smith arrived on the scene and, at Delehoy's command, handcuffed McFarlane. After McFarlane was handcuffed, Delehoy went to the trash can into which McFarlane had reached. He removed the liner and found a revolver containing six spent ammunition cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, McFarlane testified in his own defense. He stated that he and Moore had a physical altercation in the abandoned parking lot, during which Moore attempted to shoot him with the revolver that was later found in the trash can. McFarlane explained that Moore then fled, but McFarlane followed, stopping to look in the trash can out of curiosity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, McFarlane filed a motion to suppress, claiming that his detention and arrest violated the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution because there was neither probable cause for the arrest nor reasonable suspicion for the detention. After an evidentiary hearing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the district court denied the motion, concluding that there was reasonable suspicion to detain McFarlane for an investigative stop under <i>Terry v.

In resolving McFarlane's challenge, we bypass the district court's <i>Terry</i> stop analysis because we conclude, in accord with the government's alternative position, that Delehoy had probable cause to arrest McFarlane at the moment he ordered him to the ground.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An arrest does not contravene the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable seizures so long as the arrest is supported by probable cause. <i>See United States v.

The inquiry into probable cause to support an arrest focuses on what the officer knew at the time of the arrest, and should evaluate the totality of the circumstances. <i>See United States v.

Before the arrest, Delehoy heard several gun shots from a close distance and then observed McFarlane following Moore in what appeared to be a chase. He saw Moore sprinting away from McFarlane and looking back over his shoulder several times to check on McFarlane's distance. He also saw what he thought was McFarlane's attempt to hide an object in a trash can by removing a liner, placing both hands in the can, and then replacing the liner. <i>See United States v.

Here, there was a sufficient basis for Delehoy to credit Moore's statement. Moore made the statement to Delehoy face-to-face, which supports the statement's reliability because the face-to-face nature of the encounter permitted Delehoy to observe Moore's apparent relief when he realized that a police officer was present. This conduct was consistent with Moore's claim that someone was trying to shoot him. <i>See United States v. Romain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201394\"><a href=\"/opinion/201394/united-states-v-romain/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2004) (\"A face-to-face encounter provides police officers the opportunity to perceive and evaluate personally an informant's mannerisms, expressions and tone of voice and, thus, to assess the informant's veracity more readily . . . .\"). The nature of the encounter also allowed Delehoy to learn Moore's identity and appearance so he could hold him responsible if the information provided later turned out to be false. <i>See Florida v. J.L.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 270-71, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span> (2000). Furthermore, after Moore made the statement, Delehoy saw McFarlane appear to hide something in the trash can, which was consistent with Moore's assertion that McFarlane had tried to shoot him. <i>See United States v. Greenburg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201684\"><a href=\"/opinion/201684/united-states-v-greenburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2005) (stating that an officer's observation of conduct consistent with the informant's tip supports the tip's veracity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Delehoy saw a chase between two men after hearing gun shots and then learned from one participant of the chase that the other had tried to shoot him.

Under this standard, we conclude that Delehoy had probable cause to arrest McFarlane after he saw him go into the trash can. The motion to suppress was correctly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane also challenges two aspects of the district court's jury instructions. First, he claims that the court did not adequately explain the concept of constructive possession as applied to this case, and second, he challenges the district court's instruction concerning the significance of his indictment in the jury deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the form of the constructive possession instruction. After determining that the facts could permit a guilty verdict under either an actual or constructive possession theory, the district court provided the following instruction concerning constructive possession:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[C]onstructive possession means power &#8212; the power and intention at any given time to exercise control or dominion of the object. Let me give you an example. If my son asks me to take his car to the repair shop, I'm driving it to the repair place. I have actual possession of the car. I get there, I turn the car over to the repair people. At that point, they have actual possession of the car. I have constructive possession. I intend that they do certain things with the car, and I have the ability to take it away if I want to. So that is called constructive possession. The repair people have actual possession until such time as they're done with the car and I pick it up again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, understand that ownership is not required with respect to possession. So that's why I carefully told you I was taking my son's car. He's the owner. I have possession while I take it there. Once I give it to the repair people, they have actual possession. I have constructive possession. So ownership is wholly irrelevant to this. Now, possession, where it's actual or constructive, does not have to be continuous, nor does it have to be for any particular length of time, even a short period is enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane objected to the constructive possession instruction, asserting that it improperly permitted the jury to convict on a constructive possession theory, even if the jury believed his testimony that he merely found the gun in the trash can. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During deliberations, the jury submitted two questions to the district court concerning constructive possession. The jury asked (1) \"Does looking for the gun constitute <i>intent</i> to exercise control and dominion over the gun?\" and (2) \"Does opening the trash bag, with the intent to find the gun, which is indeed there, constitute putting himself in the position to have the <i>power</i> to exercise control and dominion over the gun?\" After a discussion with counsel, the court determined that providing specific answers to these questions would be inappropriate because the answers could be interpreted by the jury as providing the court's view as to what the evidence demonstrated. Instead, the court provided the following, more general, supplemental instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The very short answer to that is that it is for you to decide each of these questions. As I told you, possession requires, and you clearly understand this, both the ability and intention to take physical control of an object. You are asking me to decide whether a particular act by itself constitutes intent to exercise control and whether . . . doing something with that intent then puts the defendant in the position of having the power to exercise control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And all I can tell you is that you need to look at all of the evidence of what occurred. You need to look &#8212; particularly with respect to intent &#8212; you need to look at everything the defendant did, at everything he said, and the circumstances that existed at the time that he acted and spoke and decide from all of that whether he had the intent at a particular point in time that you're considering to exercise control over the object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And similarly, with respect to his ability, his power to exercise control, you need to look at the whole thing and then you need to decide. I can't [tell you] whether he did indeed have the power to exercise control. You need to look at all the facts that existed at the particular moment in time and decide that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane asserts that this instruction was erroneous and prejudicial because it did not describe to the jury the way in which the definition of constructive possession related to the specific facts of this case. In particular, in light of his contention that he just happened upon the ammunition when looking into the trash can (and his view that the jury questions at least suggested that they accepted this theory), he argues that the district court should have instructed that \"mere curiosity . . . coupled with a direct look at the gun that held the subject ammunition, does not establish constructive possession of the ammunition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this challenge concerns the form and wording of the instructions, we review them for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Tom,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782082\"><a href=\"/opinion/782082/united-states-v-luis-tom-aka-cuba/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 91 (1st Cir.2003). In formulating jury instructions, a district court is not required \"to parrot the language proffered by the parties.\" <i>United States v. Glaum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200833\"><a href=\"/opinion/200833/united-states-v-glaum/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span>, 178 (1st Cir.2004). Within wide margins, the district court maintains discretion in the precise manner that it explains legal concepts to the jury. <i>Id.</i> We consider only \"whether, taken as a whole, the court's instructions fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.\" <i>Tom,</i> 330 F.3d at 91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constructive possession instruction accurately described the elements required for a conviction under this theory. As they indicated, a conviction for constructive possession requires proof that a \"person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion over an object . . . .\" <i>United States v. Gobbi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202578\"><a href=\"/opinion/202578/united-states-v-gobbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir.2006). The district court also provided a cogent, everyday example of constructive possession to aid the jury's understanding. The court decided, however, not to apply the definition of constructive possession to the facts of the case for fear that such an instruction would interfere with the jury's fact finding role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This fear was warranted. \"[T]hough a trial court is permitted to marshal the evidence for the jury and, if it chooses, to comment on it, the court is not permitted to impose its own opinions on the jury or present its own theories when they are not strongly grounded in the evidence.\" <i>Ostrowski v. Atl. Mut. Ins. Cos.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586295\"><a href=\"/opinion/586295/james-p-ostrowski-v-atlantic-mutual-insurance-companies/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, 185 (2d Cir.1992). Here, the main dispute at trial was over McFarlane's intent in going into the trash can. The court was properly concerned that describing various versions of the facts (and the intentions that might be inferred from them), and then instructing whether a conviction for constructive possession was warranted under each particular version, would intrude on the jury's function to find the facts and draw the inferences from them. Under these circumstances, the district court's concern was reasonable. The court therefore did not abuse its discretion by rejecting the more specific instructions sought by McFarlane.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane's second challenge to the jury instructions concerns the instruction on the appropriate use of the indictment. The court told the jury: Now, the only other thing I want to mention is that you will have with you in the jury room a copy of the indictment. Understand, again, that the indictment is nothing more than the accusation. It is the document that contains the accusation. It is not evidence of guilt, it is not proof of guilt. It is simply the accusation, and you should not use it in determining whether the government has proven him guilty or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>It is a judgment by an earlier, larger jury that there's probable cause to believe the witness &#8212; that the defendant did this,</i> but it is not evidence of guilt, it is not proof of guilt. Indeed, the defendant is, under the Constitution and laws of this country, entitled to what we call the presumption of innocence. But effectively, that means that he is innocent until the government proves him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And because he is innocent, he doesn't have to prove his innocence. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarlane claims that the statement that a larger jury (<i>i.e.,</i> the grand jury) had heard the matter and concluded that there was probable cause to believe that he had committed the crime was prejudicial because it misled the petit jury into believing that the case already had been resolved against him. McFarlane did not object to this instruction before the district court, however, and therefore we review it for plain error only. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez-Velez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span>, 34-35 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under plain error review, the defendant must show a clear error that affected his substantial rights and undermined the integrity, fairness or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.2005). McFarlane does not prevail under this \"demanding standard.\" <i>United States v. Colon Osorio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200892\"><a href=\"/opinion/200892/united-states-v-colon-osorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is long settled in this circuit that \"subject to a proper covering instruction, whether the indictment should be given to the jury for use during its deliberations is within the discretion of the trial court.\" <i>United States v. Medina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451686\"><a href=\"/opinion/451686/united-states-v-alejo-maldonado-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 21-22 (1st Cir.1985). The district court's statement that a \"larger jury\" had found probable cause, if considered in isolation, could mislead a petit jury into according significance to the grand jury's action. But we do not review jury instructions in isolation; we review the charge as a whole. <i>See United States v. DeMasi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195694\"><a href=\"/opinion/195694/united-states-v-de-masi/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span>, 1317 (1st Cir.1994). The charge read in its entirety made it clear that the indictment was not evidence of guilt. The court instructed the jury that the indictment was only an accusation that could not be used as proof of guilt and that the defendant enjoyed a presumption of innocence at all times. Indeed, the instruction given here is similar to a covering instruction that we approved as adequate to guard against the jury's using the indictment as evidence. <i>See United States v. Glantz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506187\"><a href=\"/opinion/506187/united-states-v-ronald-henry-glantz/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10-11 (1st Cir.1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> There was no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The \"A/K/A\" Portion of the Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McFarlane claims that the indictment submitted to the jury was prejudicial because it included an alias. The indictment charged \"Clive McFarlane, a/k/a Clive McFarland.\" McFarlane claims that it was prejudicial error for the alias not to be removed from the indictment before it was submitted to the jury. He asserts that the alias had nothing to do with the case and therefore it prejudiced the jury's deliberation to learn of the alias. McFarlane did not preserve this objection below, and thus our review is again limited to plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the use of an alias is important to the government's case, its submission to the jury as part of the indictment is permissible. <i>See United States v. Candelaria-Silva,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198309\"><a href=\"/opinion/198309/united-states-v-candelaria-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir. 1999). But this practice has been discouraged where the alias is irrelevant. <i>E.g., United States v. Wilkerson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"301809\"><a href=\"/opinion/301809/united-states-v-jan-alvord-wilkerson-united-states-of-america-v-ransom/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 59 (6th Cir.1972). Even assuming that allowing the indictment to go to the jury without redacting the alias was plain error, McFarlane has not demonstrated that the error affected his substantial rights. The indictment was not referenced by the government during the trial or by the court in its instructions. Indeed, at no point was the alias brought to the jury's attention. <i>See People v. Romero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421742\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421742/people-v-romero/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1256</span></a></span>, 1268 (Colo.1985) (finding no plain error under similar facts). In these circumstances, it would be pure speculation to conclude that the listing of the alias in the indictment had any effect on deliberations. Such speculation is insufficient to ground a successful claim that a clear error affected the defendant's substantial rights. <i>See generally Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 78 (observing that, even under the most permissive articulation of the plain error standard by the Supreme Court, the defendant must show a \"reasonable probability\" that the error affected the outcome of the district court proceeding in order to demonstrate an effect on substantial rights).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, McFarlane's conviction is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The evidence presented at the hearing was identical in all material respects to the trial evidence described earlier</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In resolving McFarlane's challenge on the basis of probable cause, we do not mean to imply that the district court's analysis was incorrect but only that probable cause provides a more straightforward ground for affirmance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The instruction in<i>Glantz</i> stated:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">You must understand the effect of an indictment. It is only an accusation. The fact that it has been brought is totally meaningless so far as your task is concerned. It may not be the basis of any suggestion of guilt. All that it does is to bring this matter before you for your determination. Beyond that, it has no significance whatever from the point of view of guilt or innocence.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\n          <i>Id.</i>\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
