Finding no\n\nerror, we affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          As its longtime corporate clerk and counsel, Rome filed\n\na chapter 11 petition in behalf of CHM in November 1989, followed\n\nby  an  application for  Rome's  appointment  as counsel  to  the\n\nchapter  11  debtor in  possession  pursuant  to Bankruptcy  Code\n\n  1107(a), 11 U.S.C.   1107(a); see  also id.   327(a), 11 U.S.C.\n                                             \n\n   327(a).  Thereafter, as  counsel to the  debtor in possession,\n\nRome filed three abortive chapter 11 reorganization plans propos-\n\ning a 20% dividend  to general creditors.  Various  CHM creditors\n\nsuccessfully resisted  these initiatives, however, on  the ground\n\nthat the plans would  unfairly advantage certain CHM  insiders   \n\nincluding its president and sole shareholder, Arnold Leavitt, and\n\nLeavitt's family  and friends    by  providing priority repayment\n\nof their prepetition \"loans\" to  CHM.  In August 1990,  after all\n\nthree plans failed to win creditor approval, the bankruptcy court\n\nacceded to creditor demands  for the appointment of a  chapter 11\n\ntrustee, appellee  Joseph Braunstein, and to  Braunstein's reten-\n\n                                2\n\ntion  of Riemer and Braunstein (R &amp;  B) as counsel to the chapter\n\n11 trustee.\n\n          Meanwhile, three months before Braunstein's appointment\n\nas  the CHM chapter 11 trustee, an involuntary chapter 7 petition\n\nhad been filed against Arnold Leavitt.  Shortly thereafter, while\n\nstill serving as counsel to CHM  in its chapter 11 case, and with\n\nbankruptcy court authorization, Rome began to serve as counsel to\n\nArnold Leavitt  in  the involuntary  chapter  7 proceeding.    As\n\nchapter 11  trustee, appellee Braunstein began  negotiations with\n\nRome,  by then  also  representing one  Sandra Dickerman,  Arnold\n\nLeavitt's secretary at  CHM, in her ultimately  successful bid to\n\npurchase property belonging  to the  CHM chapter 11  estate.   In\n\nMarch  1991,  less than  two  months after  the  bankruptcy court\n\napproved the Dickerman acquisitions from CHM, the  CHM chapter 11\n\nproceedings  were  converted  to  chapter 7  and  Braunstein  was\n\nappointed the CHM chapter 7 trustee.\n\n          Late  in 1991, Braunstein, R &amp; B, and Rome filed appli-\n\ncations  for compensation  and  reimbursement of  expenses.   The\n\nBraunstein application, as chapter 11 and chapter 7 trustee,  and\n\nthe R &amp; D application as counsel to the chapter 11 and  chapter 7\n\ntrustee,  approximated $81,000  in  fees.   The Rome  request, as\n\ncounsel  to CHM qua debtor  and chapter 11  debtor in possession,\n                   \n\napproximated  $62,000.   The  applications  were  opposed by  CHM\n\ncreditors; additionally, Braunstein, as  the CHM chapter 7 trust-\n\nee, opposed the Rome application.  \n\n                                3\n\n          At the  hearing held on these  fee applications, Braun-\n\nstein represented to the bankruptcy court that he intended to set\n\naside  certain  prepetition transfers  of  CHM  assets as  either\n\npreferential or  fraudulent.  Creditors represented  to the court\n\nthat  Arnold Leavitt had \"looted\"  CHM prior to  Rome's filing of\n\nthe  CHM  chapter  11 petition,  by  transferring  CHM  assets to\n\nLeavitt  family members, and that  Rome, in an  effort to further\n\nLeavitt's  interests at  the expense  of  CHM and  its creditors,\n\nrepeatedly  \"obstructed\" creditor  efforts  to investigate  CHM's\n\nfinancial  condition  and to  promote  its  reorganization.   The\n\nbankruptcy  court ultimately allowed the Braunstein and R &amp; B fee\n\napplications  in full.  On  the other hand,  the court disallowed\n\nthe Rome  application  entirely,  on two  grounds:    (1)  Rome's\n\ncontentious tenure as counsel to  the debtor in possession  \"pro-\n\nduced virtually  no benefit to creditors  and loan participants\";\n\nand (2) Rome's concurrent  representation of CHM and  Leavitt, as\n\nwell as  CHM and  Dickerman, was \"patently  inappropriate.\"   The\n\ndistrict court affirmed.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          The  Bankruptcy  Code  imposes   particularly  rigorous\n\nconflict-of-interest  restraints upon  the employment  of profes-\n\nsional persons in a bankruptcy case.\n\n          Except as otherwise provided in this section,\n          the  trustee, with the  court's approval, may\n                                                  \n          employ  one  or more  attorneys, accountants,\n\n                                4\n\n          appraisers, auctioneers, or other profession-\n          al persons, that do  not hold or represent an\n                                                    \n          interest adverse to the  estate, and that are\n                                              \n          disinterested persons, to represent or assist\n                               \n          the  trustee in  carrying  out the  trustee's\n          duties under this title.\n\nBankruptcy Code    327(a), 11  U.S.C.   327(a)  (emphasis added).\n\nSee Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2014; In re Cropper Co.,  35 B.R. 625, 629-\n                                             \n\n30 (Bankr.

D. Utah\n                            \n\n1985).   Moreover, as the bankruptcy court is invested with ample\n\npower  to  deter  inappropriate  influences  upon  the  undivided\n\nloyalty of court-appointed professionals throughout their tenure,\n                                                                \n\nthe  need for  professional self-scrutiny  and avoidance  of con-\n\nflicts of interest does not end upon appointment.  The court \"may\n                                                                 \n\ndeny  allowance of compensation . . . if, at any time during such\n                                                     \n\n.  .  . employment  . . .  , such  professional person  is  not a\n\ndisinterested person, or represents  or holds an interest adverse\n                                                                 \n\nto the interest of the estate . . . .\"  Bankruptcy Code   328(c),\n\n11  U.S.C.    328(c)  (emphasis  added).   Thus,  section  328(c)\n\nauthorizes  a  \"penalty\" for  failing  to  avoid a  disqualifying\n\nconflict of  interest.  See S. Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess.\n                           \n\n39 (1978). \n\n                                5\n\n          Although  the  Code  idiom \"interest  adverse\"  is  not\n\ndefined,1 the  companion requirement    that  appointees be \"dis-\n\ninterested\"     is  defined,  see Bankruptcy  Code   101(14),  11\n                                 \n\nU.S.C.   101(14), as  including, inter  alia, one who  is \"not  a\n                                            \n\ncreditor, an  equity shareholder, or an  insider,\" nor presently,\n                                                      \n\nor  \"within two  years  before [bankruptcy],  a[n] . . .  officer\n                                                                 \n\n. . .of the debtor,\"  and does not  have \"an interest  materially\n                                                                 \n\nadverse to the interest of  the estate or of any class  of credi-\n       \n\ntors or equity security holders\" for \"any reason.\"  Id.

We  express no  view  on these  claims,  and\nconfine our holding to Rome's impermissible representation of two\nother clients (Leavitt and Dickerman) with \"interests adverse\" to\nthe CHM estate which he was responsible for representing by court\nappointment. \n\n                                6\n\n          In the exercise of  its own ongoing affirmative respon-\n\nsibility to \"root out  impermissible conflicts of interest\" under\n\nBankruptcy Code     327(a) and 328(c), the  bankruptcy court must\n\ndetermine whether  any  competing interest  of a  court-appointed\n\nprofessional  \"created  either  a  meaningful  incentive  to  act\n\ncontrary  to  the best  interests of  the  estate and  its sundry\n\ncreditors    an  incentive sufficient to  place those parties  at\n\nmore  than acceptable  risk     or  the reasonable  perception of\n                                                              \n\none.\"   Martin, 817 F.2d  at 180 (emphasis  added).  The  test is\n              \n\nneither subjective, nor  significantly influenced  by the  court-\n\nappointed  professional's \"protestations of  good faith,\" as Rome\n\nwould  have  it, see,  e.g., supra  note  2, but  contemplates an\n                                  \n\nobjective screening  for even  the  \"appearance of  impropriety.\"\n\nId.  at 180-81, 182.  Finally, if its fact-specific inquiry leads\n   \n\nthe bankruptcy  court to conclude that  an impermissible conflict\n\nof interest looms or exists, available sanctions include disqual-\n\nification and  the denial or  disgorgement of all  fees.   Id. at\n                                                              \n\n182-83.  See Bankruptcy  Code   328(c), 11 U.S.C.   328(c).   We,\n            \n\nlike the district court, will then review the bankruptcy  court's\n\nfactual  findings for clear error  and its conclusions  of law de\n                                                                 \n\nnovo.  In re La Roche, 969 F.2d 1299, 1301 (1st Cir. 1992). \n                     \n\n          The  bankruptcy court  determined that  Rome improperly\n\nrepresented  two undisclosed  \"interest[s]  adverse\"  to the  CHM\n\nchapter  11 estate      Arnold Leavitt  and  Sandra Dickerman    \n\nresulting  in  actual  conflicts  of  interest warranting  Rome's\n\nretroactive  disqualification and forfeiture  of all compensation\n           \n\n                                7\n\nfrom  the chapter 11 estate.   Rome raises  three principal chal-\n\nlenges to the bankruptcy court ruling.  \n\nA.  The Duty of Disclosure\n                          \n\n            First, Rome argues that  retroactive disqualification\n\nis inequitable in these circumstances, since the bankruptcy court\n\nand the  trustee tacitly  endorsed his representation  of Leavitt\n\nand  Dickerman, pendente lite, or,  at the very  least, voiced no\n                             \n\nobjection until the filing of his application for compensation in\n\nDecember  1991.  Given the relevant findings in this case, howev-\n\ner, we  are not  swayed by  Rome's resort  to general  notions of\n\nequity.\n\n          Although the  bankruptcy court has an  affirmative duty\n\nto  exercise  vigilance in  avoiding  impermissible  conflicts of\n\ninterest on the part of court-appointed professionals, see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nIn re  Anver Corp., 44 B.R. 615, 617 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1984) (once\n                  \n\nalerted to  potential conflict of  interest on part  of appointed\n\ncounsel,  the bankruptcy court must  raise the issue, sua sponte,\n                                                                \n\nin order to safeguard  its institutional integrity), normally the\n\nprofessional, especially  counsel, possesses ready access  to, if\n\nnot full   awareness of,  the facts material  to any existing  or\n\npotential  competing  interest  which  might  conflict  with  the\n\ninterests court-appointed counsel must represent, or those  which\n\nmight generate an unacceptable appearance or risk of conflict.\n\n          As  with other prophylactic  ethical rules constraining\n\nattorney conduct, sections 327(a) and 328(c) cannot achieve their\n\npurpose unless  court-appointed counsel police themselves  in the\n\n                                8\n\nfirst instance, especially in  circumstances such as these, where\n\nthe nominal applicant (CHM) for Rome's appointment is a corporate\n\ndebtor  in possession who can  only act through  its officers and\n\nagents     here  Leavitt,  Rome, and  Dickerman     and  may  not\n                                                                 \n\ncommand the appointee's primary  loyalty.

The Leavitt Interests\n                              \n\n          Rome  argues that  section  327(a) does  not absolutely\n\nprohibit concurrent  representation  of  a  corporate  debtor  in\n\npossession  and its  sole shareholder,  absent  evidence affirma-\n\ntively  demonstrating  an \"actual\"      as  distinguished from  a\n\n\"potential\"    conflict of interest.  Moreover,  there could have\n\nbeen  no \"actual\"  conflict, he  suggests, because:   (1) between\n\nDecember 1989 and May  1990, Rome did not represent  Leavitt; (2)\n\nbetween May  1990, when  the involuntary chapter  7 petition  was\n\n                                11\n\nfiled  against  Leavitt, and  August  1990,  when Braunstein  was\n\nappointed the CHM  chapter 11  trustee, it was  not Rome but  the\n\nchapter  7 trustee who represented the  Leavitt chapter 7 estate;\n\nand (3) none of the transfers from CHM to Leavitt  prior to CHM's\n\nchapter 11  petition have yet been  proven improper, preferential\n\nor fraudulent.  These arguments are specious.\n\n          The fact that Rome did not  represent Leavitt until May\n\n1990 is  immaterial, since section 328(c)  expressly empowers the\n\nbankruptcy  court  to  disallow compensation  if  court-appointed\n\ncounsel, \"at any  time,\" is either  not a \"disinterested\"  person\n\n\"or  represents or holds an  interest adverse to  the interest of\n\nthe  estate  with respect  to the  matter  on which  [counsel] is\n\nemployed.\"  Bankruptcy Code   328(c), 11 U.S.C.   328(c).  Rome's\n\npost-May 1990 representation of chapter 7 debtor Leavitt, against\n\nwhom the  CHM chapter 11  estate    also  represented by Rome    \n\nheld claims for the avoidance of alleged preferential and fraudu-\n\nlent  transfers, created  a  clear conflict  of interest  without\n                                                                 \n\nregard  to whether the Leavitt chapter 7 estate itself was repre-\n                                                                 \n\nsented  by a  trustee  in bankruptcy.    After all,  Rome  sought\n                                    \n\ncompensation for services rendered to  the CHM chapter 11 estate,\n                                                                \n\nnot to Leavitt, the chapter 7 debtor.  Cf. In re Hoffman, 53 B.R.\n                                                        \n\n564, 565 (Bankr.  W.D. Ark.  1985) (  327(a)  is inapplicable  to\n\nappointment or compensation of counsel to chapter 7 debtor).  Yet\n\nRome's  representation of  Leavitt in  the involuntary  chapter 7\n\nproceeding plainly  undermined  confidence in  Rome's ability  to\n\nprovide  impartial  advice to  the  CHM  estate  relating to  the\n\n                                12\n\nprospects  for recovering  the alleged  prepetition transfers  to\n\nLeavitt and Leavitt family members.\n\n          As concerns  Rome's third contention     that no trans-\n\nfers  from CHM to Leavitt prior to CHM's chapter 11 petition have\n\nyet  been proven improper,  preferential or fraudulent     we are\n                \n\nbound by  the bankruptcy court's factual  findings unless clearly\n\nerroneous.   See In re La Roche, 969 F.2d  at 1301; In re Martin,\n                                                                \n\n817 F.2d at 182-83 (noting that \"[t]he bankruptcy judge is on the\n\nfront line, in the  best position to gauge the  ongoing interplay\n\nof  [  327(a)] factors  and to make  the delicate  judgment calls\n\nwhich such a  decision entails\");  In re Huddleston,  120 B.R  at\n                                                   \n\n402-03  (favoring  case-by-case  analysis).

The Dickerman Interests\n                                \n\n          Rome argues, in a similar vein, that after Braunstein's\n\nappointment  as  the  CHM  chapter  11 trustee  in  August  1990,\n\nBraunstein  alone represented CHM's interests.  Thus, as a matter\n                                                                 \n\nof  law, there  could  have been  no  disqualifying \"conflict  of\n       \n\ninterest\" in Rome's concurrent representation of Dickerman in her\n\nsuccessful purchase of CHM's assets.  Moreover, even as a factual\n\nmatter,  he argues,  there  could have  been  no actual  conflict\n\nbecause Dickerman was the only bidder and the sale benefited both\n                              \n\nbuyer and seller.\n\n          As with  other arguments insistently advanced  by Rome,\n\nthis one presupposes that there can  be no disqualifying conflict\n\nabsent proof of actual loss or injury.  On the contrary, simulta-\n                                     \n\nneous  representation of  the buyer  and the  seller in  the same\n\ntransaction  is a prototypical disqualifying conflict of interest\n\neven if it is not  invariably disqualifying in all circumstances.\n\nSee  In re Tidewater Memorial  Hosp., Inc., 110  B.R. 221, 228-29\n                                          \n\n(Bankr.

Even if Dickerman was the highest bidder for\n                \n\nthese  CHM assets, or even the only one, Rome's longtime position\n\nas corporate  clerk  and counsel  to  CHM, both  prepetition  and\n\npostpetition, presumably  afforded him  unique  access to  inside\n\ninformation  concerning  the  nature  and value  of  its  assets,\n\ninformation that Rome could have used (or been tempted to use) to\n\nenable  his other  client     Dickerman      to submit  a  better\n\ncalibrated bid than  arm's-length bidders could venture,  thereby\n\npotentially  chilling  bidding at  the  expense  of CHM  and  its\n\ncreditors.

Thereafter, as  counsel to the  debtor in possession,\n\nRome filed three abortive chapter 11 reorganization plans propos-\n\ning a 20% dividend  to general creditors.  Various  CHM creditors\n\nsuccessfully resisted  these initiatives, however, on  the ground\n\nthat the plans would  unfairly advantage certain CHM  insiders   \n\nincluding its president and sole shareholder, Arnold Leavitt, and\n\nLeavitt's family  and friends    by  providing priority repayment\n\nof their prepetition \"loans\" to  CHM.  In August 1990,  after all\n\nthree plans failed to win creditor approval, the bankruptcy court\n\nacceded to creditor demands  for the appointment of a  chapter 11\n\ntrustee, appellee  Joseph Braunstein, and to  Braunstein's reten-\n\n                                2\n\ntion  of Riemer and Braunstein (R &amp;  B) as counsel to the chapter\n\n11 trustee.\n\n          Meanwhile, three months before Braunstein's appointment\n\nas  the CHM chapter 11 trustee, an involuntary chapter 7 petition\n\nhad been filed against Arnold Leavitt.  Shortly thereafter, while\n\nstill serving as counsel to CHM  in its chapter 11 case, and with\n\nbankruptcy court authorization, Rome began to serve as counsel to\n\nArnold Leavitt  in  the involuntary  chapter  7 proceeding.    As\n\nchapter 11  trustee, appellee Braunstein began  negotiations with\n\nRome,  by then  also  representing one  Sandra Dickerman,  Arnold\n\nLeavitt's secretary at  CHM, in her ultimately  successful bid to\n\npurchase property belonging  to the  CHM chapter 11  estate.   In\n\nMarch  1991,  less than  two  months after  the  bankruptcy court\n\napproved the Dickerman acquisitions from CHM, the  CHM chapter 11\n\nproceedings  were  converted  to  chapter 7  and  Braunstein  was\n\nappointed the CHM chapter 7 trustee.\n\n          Late  in 1991, Braunstein, R &amp; B, and Rome filed appli-\n\ncations  for compensation  and  reimbursement of  expenses.   The\n\nBraunstein application, as chapter 11 and chapter 7 trustee,  and\n\nthe R &amp; D application as counsel to the chapter 11 and  chapter 7\n\ntrustee,  approximated $81,000  in  fees.   The Rome  request, as\n\ncounsel  to CHM qua debtor  and chapter 11  debtor in possession,\n                   \n\napproximated  $62,000.   The  applications  were  opposed by  CHM\n\ncreditors; additionally, Braunstein, as  the CHM chapter 7 trust-\n\nee, opposed the Rome application.  \n\n                                3\n\n          At the  hearing held on these  fee applications, Braun-\n\nstein represented to the bankruptcy court that he intended to set\n\naside  certain  prepetition transfers  of  CHM  assets as  either\n\npreferential or  fraudulent.  Creditors represented  to the court\n\nthat  Arnold Leavitt had \"looted\"  CHM prior to  Rome's filing of\n\nthe  CHM  chapter  11 petition,  by  transferring  CHM  assets to\n\nLeavitt  family members, and that  Rome, in an  effort to further\n\nLeavitt's  interests at  the expense  of  CHM and  its creditors,\n\nrepeatedly  \"obstructed\" creditor  efforts  to investigate  CHM's\n\nfinancial  condition  and to  promote  its  reorganization.   The\n\nbankruptcy  court ultimately allowed the Braunstein and R &amp; B fee\n\napplications  in full.  On  the other hand,  the court disallowed\n\nthe Rome  application  entirely,  on two  grounds:    (1)  Rome's\n\ncontentious tenure as counsel to  the debtor in possession  \"pro-\n\nduced virtually  no benefit to creditors  and loan participants\";\n\nand (2) Rome's concurrent  representation of CHM and  Leavitt, as\n\nwell as  CHM and  Dickerman, was \"patently  inappropriate.\"   The\n\ndistrict court affirmed.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          The  Bankruptcy  Code  imposes   particularly  rigorous\n\nconflict-of-interest  restraints upon  the employment  of profes-\n\nsional persons in a bankruptcy case.\n\n          Except as otherwise provided in this section,\n          the  trustee, with the  court's approval, may\n                                                  \n          employ  one  or more  attorneys, accountants,\n\n                                4\n\n          appraisers, auctioneers, or other profession-\n          al persons, that do  not hold or represent an\n                                                    \n          interest adverse to the  estate, and that are\n                                              \n          disinterested persons, to represent or assist\n                               \n          the  trustee in  carrying  out the  trustee's\n          duties under this title.\n\nBankruptcy Code    327(a), 11  U.S.C.   327(a)  (emphasis added).\n\nSee Fed.

The Duty of Disclosure\n                          \n\n            First, Rome argues that  retroactive disqualification\n\nis inequitable in these circumstances, since the bankruptcy court\n\nand the  trustee tacitly  endorsed his representation  of Leavitt\n\nand  Dickerman, pendente lite, or,  at the very  least, voiced no\n                             \n\nobjection until the filing of his application for compensation in\n\nDecember  1991.

The Leavitt Interests\n                              \n\n          Rome  argues that  section  327(a) does  not absolutely\n\nprohibit concurrent  representation  of  a  corporate  debtor  in\n\npossession  and its  sole shareholder,  absent  evidence affirma-\n\ntively  demonstrating  an \"actual\"      as  distinguished from  a\n\n\"potential\"    conflict of interest.  Moreover,  there could have\n\nbeen  no \"actual\"  conflict, he  suggests, because:   (1) between\n\nDecember 1989 and May  1990, Rome did not represent  Leavitt; (2)\n\nbetween May  1990, when  the involuntary chapter  7 petition  was\n\n                                11\n\nfiled  against  Leavitt, and  August  1990,  when Braunstein  was\n\nappointed the CHM  chapter 11  trustee, it was  not Rome but  the\n\nchapter  7 trustee who represented the  Leavitt chapter 7 estate;\n\nand (3) none of the transfers from CHM to Leavitt  prior to CHM's\n\nchapter 11  petition have yet been  proven improper, preferential\n\nor fraudulent.  These arguments are specious.\n\n          The fact that Rome did not  represent Leavitt until May\n\n1990 is  immaterial, since section 328(c)  expressly empowers the\n\nbankruptcy  court  to  disallow compensation  if  court-appointed\n\ncounsel, \"at any  time,\" is either  not a \"disinterested\"  person\n\n\"or  represents or holds an  interest adverse to  the interest of\n\nthe  estate  with respect  to the  matter  on which  [counsel] is\n\nemployed.\"  Bankruptcy Code   328(c), 11 U.S.C.   328(c).  Rome's\n\npost-May 1990 representation of chapter 7 debtor Leavitt, against\n\nwhom the  CHM chapter 11  estate    also  represented by Rome    \n\nheld claims for the avoidance of alleged preferential and fraudu-\n\nlent  transfers, created  a  clear conflict  of interest  without\n                                                                 \n\nregard  to whether the Leavitt chapter 7 estate itself was repre-\n                                                                 \n\nsented  by a  trustee  in bankruptcy.    After all,  Rome  sought\n                                    \n\ncompensation for services rendered to  the CHM chapter 11 estate,\n                                                                \n\nnot to Leavitt, the chapter 7 debtor.

The Dickerman Interests\n                                \n\n          Rome argues, in a similar vein, that after Braunstein's\n\nappointment  as  the  CHM  chapter  11 trustee  in  August  1990,\n\nBraunstein  alone represented CHM's interests.  Thus, as a matter\n                                                                 \n\nof  law, there  could  have been  no  disqualifying \"conflict  of\n       \n\ninterest\" in Rome's concurrent representation of Dickerman in her\n\nsuccessful purchase of CHM's assets.  Moreover, even as a factual\n\nmatter,  he argues,  there  could have  been  no actual  conflict\n\nbecause Dickerman was the only bidder and the sale benefited both\n                              \n\nbuyer and seller.\n\n          As with  other arguments insistently advanced  by Rome,\n\nthis one presupposes that there can  be no disqualifying conflict\n\nabsent proof of actual loss or injury.  On the contrary, simulta-\n                                     \n\nneous  representation of  the buyer  and the  seller in  the same\n\ntransaction  is a prototypical disqualifying conflict of interest\n\neven if it is not  invariably disqualifying in all circumstances.\n\nSee  In re Tidewater Memorial  Hosp., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1970947\"><a href=\"/opinion/1970947/in-re-tidewater-memorial-hosp-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 228-29\n                                          \n\n(Bankr.

Even if Dickerman was the highest bidder for\n                \n\nthese  CHM assets, or even the only one, Rome's longtime position\n\nas corporate  clerk  and counsel  to  CHM, both  prepetition  and\n\npostpetition, presumably  afforded him  unique  access to  inside\n\ninformation  concerning  the  nature  and value  of  its  assets,\n\ninformation that Rome could have used (or been tempted to use) to\n\nenable  his other  client     Dickerman      to submit  a  better\n\ncalibrated bid than  arm's-length bidders could venture,  thereby\n\npotentially  chilling  bidding at  the  expense  of CHM  and  its\n\ncreditors.

Ky. 1983) (favoring denial of all compensation if\nconflict exists, regardless of benefit from services rendered).\n\n                                18\n\ndisqualifying conflict  of interest, the bankruptcy  court cannot\n\nalways assess with precision the effect the conflict may have had\n\neither on the  results achieved  or the results  that might  have\n\nbeen  achieved by following \"the road not taken.\"  See Woods, 312\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  at 269 (\"[T]he incidence of a particular conflict of inter-\n\nest  can seldom  be measured  with any  degree of  certainty [and\n\n[t]he bankruptcy  court need not speculate as to [] the result of\n\nthe conflict . . . .\"); In re Tidewater, 110 B.R. at 229 (denying\n                                       \n\ncompensation  even though  there  was \"[n]o  doubt  the law  firm\n\nperformed  valuable services in the  chapter 11 case\").8   Yet as\n\nan appellate  court, we are  poorly positioned to  second-guess a\n\nbankruptcy  court's judgment  call  in these  circumstances,  and\n\nneither we nor the  district court have been shown any reason for\n\ndoing so in the present case.\n\n          The district court judgment is affirmed. \n          The district court judgment is affirmed.\n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     8For example, the bankruptcy court observed that Rome's role\nas counsel to  CHM, qua debtor in  possession, generated vigorous\n                       \nopposition to all three reorganization plans, as well as unusual-\nly  intense antagonism  from CHM's  general  creditors (including\nRome's longtime  law partner).  The  clear implication, unverifi-\nable  in hindsight,  is that  CHM's reorganization  prospects may\nhave  been better  but  for Rome's  insistence  on serving  three\nclients simultaneously in these proceedings.  In  re Kendavis, 91\n                                                             \nB.R. at  748 (\"[E]thical violations or conflicts  of interest may\nlessen the value  of services.   If an  attorney holds an  undis-\nclosed adverse interest, a court is empowered to deny all compen-\nsation.\")  (citation  omitted); In  re  Whitman, 51  B.R.  at 507\n                                               \n(same).   Retrospective damage assessments are  made all the more\ndifficult where  counsel has labored  under several  simultaneous\nconflicts of interest.\n\n                                19\n</pre>",
