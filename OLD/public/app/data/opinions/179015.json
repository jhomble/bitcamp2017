Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Howard and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Stefano Picciotto, Judith Picciotto and Melita Picciotto on\nbrief pro se.\n     Richard W. Renehan, Timothy J. Dacey, Mariana Korsunsky and\nGoulston & Storrs and Michael J. Stone and Peabody & Arnold, LLP,\non brief for defendant-appellee attorneys.\n     Martha Coakley, Attorney General and Sarah M. Joss, Assistant\nAttorney General, on brief for defendants-appellees Robert Steadman\nand Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr., and Robert V. Costello, in his\nofficial capacity.\n\n\n\n                            November 9, 2010\n\f              Per Curiam.        We have carefully reviewed the record\n\nand the parties’ briefs and, for the following reasons, find no\n\nerror either in the dismissal of appellants’ complaint or in\n\nthe imposition of attorneys’ fees as a sanction.\n\n              1. The two judges named as defendants are absolutely\n\nimmune from appellants’ claims for damages.\n\n              2.     Appellants lack standing to seek declaratory\n\nrelief because all they aver is that the judges had violated\n\ntheir constitutional rights during the attorneys’ fees case.\n\nThat    is,   since       that   case   is   over,   there    simply       is   no\n\npossibility        that    appellants   again    will    be   subject      to    an\n\noccurrence of such alleged violations. See Golden v. Zwickler,\n\n394 U.S. 103, 109-10 (1969) (holding that plaintiff lacked\n\nstanding      to    seek    a    judgment    declaring    a   state     statute\n\nunconstitutional where, although he had been prosecuted under\n\nthe statute in the past, the chance of a second prosecution was\n\ntoo remote).\n\n              3. Appellants fail to state a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim\n\nagainst the attorney-appellees despite their allegation that\n\nthe    attorneys     had     been   “willful    participant[s]        in   joint\n\nactivity” with the judge presiding over the state case.                         See\n\nCasa Marie, Inc. v. Superior Court of Puerto Rico, 988 F.2d\n\n252, 259 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).      First, the fact that one of the attorneys (a law\n\nschool class-mate of the judge) had visited the judge at the\n\fcourthouse in order to ask whether the judge would consider\n\nbeing a trustee on the law school’s alumni board is not enough\n\nto show a conspiracy.               As the Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\npointed out in the appeal of the state action, appellants never\n\nalleged (and do not now) that the pending case was mentioned\n\nduring this meeting or that the judge had ever pursued the\n\npossibility of a trusteeship.                  See Zabin v. Picciotto, 896\n\nN.E.2d 937, 961 (Mass. App. Ct. 2008).                      Therefore, there is\n\njust no evidence that the meeting had any connection to the\n\npending fees litigation, and, as such, appellants’ allegation\n\nin    this   regard       need     not   be    credited.         See   Educadores\n\nPuertorriquenos en Accion v. Hernandez, 367 F.3d 61, 68 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (“in considering motions to dismiss courts should .\n\n. . eschew any reliance on bald assertions, unsupportable\n\nconclusions, and opprobrious epithets”; internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n             We also need not credit appellants’ assertion that\n\nthe     judge   had       agreed    to     reward     the    attorney-appellees\n\nfinancially     in    exchange       for      this   same   attorney’s    aid    in\n\narranging for the judge to be appointed to a higher court.\n\nThere    simply      is    no    evidence      of    such   an   agreement,     and\n\nappellants do not even attempt to provide an explanation\n\nconcerning how the attorney could have arranged for such an\n\nappointment.      Finally, the events that took place around the\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\ftime of Halloween similarly cannot be used to demonstrate the\n\nexistence of a conspiracy.         In particular, appellants’ counsel\n\nwas consulted about the matter, and having essentially agreed\n\nto the goings on, see Zabin, 896 N.E.2d at 961 & n.42 (noting\n\nthat counsel voiced no objection), it is difficult to see how\n\nsuch could have been the result of joint action between the\n\nattorney-appellees and the judge.\n\n              4.    We add only the following comments.        First, we\n\nwould still affirm the dismissal of appellants’ complaint, even\n\nassuming (without deciding) that the district court had entered\n\nthe dismissal sua sponte.               That is, appellants’ briefs on\n\nappeal clearly demonstrate that any amendment would have been\n\nfutile.   See Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States, 257 F.3d 31,\n\n36-37 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that a sua sponte dismissal may\n\nbe   upheld    so    long   as   “the    allegations   contained   in   the\n\ncomplaint, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\n\nare patently meritless and beyond all hope of redemption”).\n\n              Second, the question whether the district court may\n\nhave misunderstood our judgment in Appeal No. 01-1277 is moot.\n\nThat is, the court plainly knew that the complaint still was\n\npending, as it ended up dismissing the case on the merits.\n\nMoreover, in issuing the judgment, we did not review, nor\n\nexpress any opinion regarding, the merits of the complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f            5.    Given   all   of   the   foregoing,    the    award    of\n\nattorneys’ fees was not an abuse of discretion.                Appellants\n\nfiled suit against persons who clearly are not, except in\n\nextremely limited circumstances, amenable to suit under § 1983.\n\nMoreover,    in   attempting    to     overcome   such    limitations,\n\nappellants made serious and detrimental allegations about these\n\npersons -- allegations which turned out to have no support in\n\nthe record and which, apparently, had been made up out of thin\n\nair.   From this, we think appellants’ bad faith is plain.              See\n\nChambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 45-46 (1991) (holding\n\nthat attorneys’ fees may be assessed “when a party has acted in\n\nbad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons”;\n\ninternal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed, and\n\nall pending motions are denied as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
