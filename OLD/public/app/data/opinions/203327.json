Samuel Ruddy Kamuh, a citizen of\n\nIndonesia, petitions for review of the denial by the Board of\n\nImmigration    Appeals     (BIA)   of     his   application    for    asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture    (CAT).    See    8   U.S.C.     §    1252(a).      After   careful\n\nconsideration, we deny the petition for review.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            Kamuh entered the United States on December 8, 2002, on\n\na nonimmigrant, six-month tourist visa.           On November 13, 2003, he\n\nfiled an application for asylum, claiming religious persecution.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security then served a Notice to Appear\n\non Kamuh on January 29, 2004, charging him with overstaying his\n\nvisa.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).\n\n            At an immigration hearing on November 4, 2005 and in his\n\nwritten asylum application, Kamuh described himself as an active\n\nmember of the Seventh Day Adventist Church and reported that his\n\nfather was the pastor of their congregation in Indonesia.1              Kamuh\n\nrecounted four negative encounters that he had had in Indonesia\n\nwith Muslims who were prejudiced against Christians.                  He also\n\ndescribed other incidents involving violence against various family\n\n\n     1\n      Kamuh's father, Evert, was granted asylum by a different\nimmigration judge on July 17, 2006. Kamuh, who was 35 years old\nwhen he applied for asylum, was not and could not have been\nincluded in his father's application for asylum. See 8 U.S.C. §\n1158(b)(3) (permitting an asylee's child to receive asylum); 8\nU.S.C. § 1101(b)(1) (defining \"child\" as an \"unmarried person under\ntwenty-one years of age\").\n\n                                    -2-\n\fmembers.    The immigration judge (IJ) found Kamuh's testimony to be\n\ncredible.\n\n            The first personal encounter took place in July 1999 in\n\nTernate, where Kamuh had stopped over briefly while traveling by\n\nship.   As Kamuh made his way back to reboard the ship, a fight\n\nbroke out between one of the ship's guards and a man who had tried\n\nto enter the area through a fence.        The man and three others beat\n\nthe   guard,   and   rumors   quickly   swept   through   the   crowd    that\n\nChristians had killed a Muslim guard.           Shortly thereafter, two\n\nguards requested that Kamuh show them his national identification\n\ncard, which identified him as a Christian.        One of the guards then\n\npunched Kamuh in the jaw.      Before the guard could hit him a second\n\ntime, Kamuh ran toward the ship with the guards in pursuit.             He was\n\nable to lose them in the crowd and reboarded the ship without\n\nfurther incident.      The following morning, Kamuh learned that a\n\ngroup of people had killed a man on board the ship and thrown the\n\nbody into the sea before leaving on their own boat.\n\n            The second incident occurred in July 2002 at the Kramat\n\nJati Market in East Jakarta.      Kamuh and two friends happened to be\n\nat the market when an argument between a Christian and a Muslim\n\nsalesman sparked a riot. Kamuh testified that during the fighting,\n\nthree men grabbed him and forced him to show them his national\n\nidentification card.     The men then beat Kamuh for twenty to thirty\n\nminutes before he was able to flee to his car where his friends\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fwere waiting for him.    He reported that his face was bruised, his\n\nleft eye injured, and his lip torn during the beating.    After Kamuh\n\nleft, police and soldiers arrived to end the riot and secure the\n\nmarketplace.\n\n           The third encounter took place in September 2002, when a\n\ngroup of ten or twelve armed young men came to his apartment\n\ncomplex searching for a Christian.     Kamuh testified that he locked\n\nthe door to his apartment and hid while the Muslim men searched the\n\ncomplex.   He reported that he observed through the window as the\n\nmen dragged a Christian man into the soccer field in front of the\n\nbuilding and beat him.   Kamuh stated that police came and took the\n\nmilitants away before they reached his apartment.\n\n           The final encounter involving Kamuh occurred in November\n\n2002.   Kamuh stated that he was stopped in an alley by a group of\n\nyoung people after he left a Prayer Night at his church with\n\nfriends.   The group shouted insults at Kamuh and his friends for\n\ntheir Christian beliefs and threatened to kill them if they ever\n\ntook that road again.    Two weeks later, stones were thrown at him\n\nas he rode his motorcycle through the same alley.    One stone passed\n\nin front of his face, narrowly missing him, and others hit his\n\nmotorcycle.    He did not stop and did not see who was throwing the\n\nstones. He also did not call the police, convinced that they would\n\nnot follow up on his report because he is Christian.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           Other members of Kamuh's family had similar encounters\n\nbecause   of   their   religious   beliefs.    Kamuh's   father,   Evert,\n\nreceived death threats because of his position as a pastor in the\n\nSeventh Day Adventist Church. In April 2001, one of Evert's former\n\nstudents warned him that Muslim militants were planning to burn\n\nEvert's house; Evert called the police.        Shortly thereafter, two\n\nmen approached Evert on a bus and told him to stop \"Christianizing\"\n\nyoung Muslims through his English classes.       The men also demanded\n\nthat Evert pay them two million rupiahs for \"teaching Christianity\"\n\nto Muslim students.\n\n           In December 1998, Kamuh's brother Daniel was staying in\n\nAmbon, at a hotel, when religious rioting broke out in the city.\n\nThe owner of the hotel told Daniel to stay in his room for his own\n\nsafety.   Daniel hid in the hotel for three or four days and then\n\nescaped with the help of police.          Kamuh also reported that his\n\nsister was robbed by a group of men who stopped her on the street,\n\nascertained that she was Christian, and then further harassed her.\n\nAdditionally, in January 2002, Kamuh's uncle was hit in the stomach\n\nby a stone thrown by Muslim militants who had boarded his train\n\nlooking for Christians.\n\n           Kamuh obtained his tourist visa to come to the United\n\nStates on October 1, 2002.     Following the November 2002 incident,\n\nhe made the final decision to leave Indonesia and departed for the\n\nUnited States on December 7, 2002.         Kamuh's father had preceded\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhim, arriving in the United States in 2001. Kamuh's brother Daniel\n\nand his mother have remained in Indonesia.    Kamuh explained that\n\nDaniel is well protected by the American corporation for which he\n\nworks and that his mother is periodically in hiding, but remains in\n\nIndonesia because she has been unable to obtain a visa.\n\n          Having heard this account, the IJ concluded that although\n\nKamuh's testimony was credible, he had not established that the\n\nincidents he described rose to the level of past persecution or\n\nestablished an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.\n\nThe IJ also found that Kamuh had failed to establish that the\n\nIndonesian government was unwilling or unable to control the Muslim\n\nmilitants. The IJ further concluded that Kamuh did not qualify for\n\nwithholding of removal or protection under the CAT, noting that\n\nthese require a higher level of proof than the asylum claim.2   The\n\nIJ granted Kamuh voluntary departure.   Kamuh appealed to the BIA,\n\nwhich briefly stated its agreement with the IJ's conclusions and\n\ndismissed the appeal.   This timely petition followed.\n\n                                II.\n\n          When the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ's ruling, but also\n\ndiscusses some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we consider both\n\nthe IJ's and BIA's opinions in our review.   Zheng v. Gonzales, 475\n\n\n     2\n      Kamuh offers no arguments with respect to his claims for\nwithholding of removal or protection under the CAT. As a result,\nhe has waived any right to judicial review of the denial of these\nclaims. See Topalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 131 n.3 (1st Cir.\n2005).\n\n                                -6-\n\fF.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2007).           We afford those opinions a high\n\ndegree of deference, allowing the agency's findings of fact to\n\nstand \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to\n\nconclude to the contrary.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\n           To establish eligibility for asylum, an alien must show\n\nthat he \"is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or\n\nunwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, [his\n\nnative] country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.\"                 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A); see also Harutyunyan v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 67\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).      In order to establish that the mistreatment he\n\nhas experienced or would experience upon return rises to the level\n\nof   \"persecution,\"   the   alien   must   show,    inter    alia,   that   the\n\nmistreatment   was    the   \"'direct     result    of   government    action,\n\ngovernment-supported     action,    or    government's      unwillingness   or\n\ninability to control private conduct.'\"           Ortiz-Araniba v. Keisler,\n\n505 F.3d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Orelien v. Gonzales, 467\n\nF.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir. 2006)); see also Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Action by non-governmental actors can\n\nundergird a claim of persecution only if there is some showing that\n\nthe alleged persecutors are in league with the government or are\n\nnot controllable by the government.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f             The IJ determined that Kamuh had failed to show that the\n\nincidents he described, all of which involved violence by private\n\ncitizens, were connected with either action or inaction on the part\n\nof   the   Indonesian    government.          As    the   IJ   noted,   the    State\n\nDepartment's 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and the\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report both indicate that the\n\nconstitution of Indonesia provides for religious freedom.                       Both\n\nreports also conclude that the government generally respects this\n\nprovision and that Christianity is officially acknowledged as one\n\nof several recognized religions.              Although the Religious Freedom\n\nReport states that \"[o]n some occasions, the Government tolerated\n\nthe abuse of religious freedom by private groups or failed to\n\npunish     perpetrators,\"   the    IJ    reasonably       concluded     that    this\n\ntolerance is not the norm.         See Matter of A-M 23 I & N Dec. 737,\n\n741 (BIA 2005) (noting that the 2002 Country Report for Indonesia\n\n\"indicate[d] that incidents of harm related to religious or ethnic\n\nstrife     generally    involved   fellow          citizens    rather   than    the\n\nGovernment or Government agents, and that Government acquiescence\n\n[was] not the norm\").       Indeed, the report goes on to detail the\n\ngovernment's efforts to investigate various incidents of violence\n\nby militant Muslims aimed at Christians and to prosecute those\n\ninvolved.\n\n             Moreover, Kamuh's account of his own experiences in\n\nIndonesia demonstrates that the government was both willing and\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fable to respond when authorities were alerted to interreligious\n\nviolence.    See Ortiz-Araniba, 505 F.3d at 42 (\"In determining\n\nwhether a government is willing and able to control persecutors, we\n\nhave explained that a prompt response by local authorities to prior\n\nincidents is 'the most telling datum.'\" (quoting Harutyunyan, 421\n\nF.3d at 68)).    The police responded to several of the incidents\n\nKamuh described: in December 1998, Kamuh's brother reportedly\n\nescaped from religious violence in Ambon with help from the police;\n\nin April 2001, Evert called police after learning of a plot to burn\n\nhis house, and the house was not burned; in July 2002 when Kamuh\n\nwas caught up in rioting in a market, the police quelled the\n\nviolence after Kamuh had left; and, in September 2002, police\n\narrived and took away the armed men who had come to Kamuh's\n\napartment building before the men arrived at Kamuh's apartment.\n\n            Against this backdrop, the IJ reasonably concluded that\n\nKamuh's insistence that the police \"side with the militants\" was\n\nunsubstantiated by the State Department reports and Kamuh's own\n\ntestimony.   Thus, we affirm the IJ's conclusion that Kamuh failed\n\nto establish the necessary connection between the mistreatment he\n\nexperienced or would experience in the future and any action or\n\ninaction on the part of the Indonesian government.    Without this\n\ngovernmental link, Kamuh cannot establish either past persecution\n\nor a well-founded fear of future persecution and his asylum claim\n\nnecessarily fails.\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fPetition denied.\n\n\n\n\n                   -10-\n\f",

He also did not call the police, convinced that they would\n\nnot follow up on his report because he is Christian.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           Other members of Kamuh's family had similar encounters\n\nbecause   of   their   religious   beliefs.    Kamuh's   father,   Evert,\n\nreceived death threats because of his position as a pastor in the\n\nSeventh Day Adventist Church. In April 2001, one of Evert's former\n\nstudents warned him that Muslim militants were planning to burn\n\nEvert's house; Evert called the police.        Shortly thereafter, two\n\nmen approached Evert on a bus and told him to stop \"Christianizing\"\n\nyoung Muslims through his English classes.       The men also demanded\n\nthat Evert pay them two million rupiahs for \"teaching Christianity\"\n\nto Muslim students.\n\n           In December 1998, Kamuh's brother Daniel was staying in\n\nAmbon, at a hotel, when religious rioting broke out in the city.\n\nThe owner of the hotel told Daniel to stay in his room for his own\n\nsafety.   Daniel hid in the hotel for three or four days and then\n\nescaped with the help of police.          Kamuh also reported that his\n\nsister was robbed by a group of men who stopped her on the street,\n\nascertained that she was Christian, and then further harassed her.\n\nAdditionally, in January 2002, Kamuh's uncle was hit in the stomach\n\nby a stone thrown by Muslim militants who had boarded his train\n\nlooking for Christians.\n\n           Kamuh obtained his tourist visa to come to the United\n\nStates on October 1, 2002.     Following the November 2002 incident,\n\nhe made the final decision to leave Indonesia and departed for the\n\nUnited States on December 7, 2002.         Kamuh's father had preceded\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhim, arriving in the United States in 2001. Kamuh's brother Daniel\n\nand his mother have remained in Indonesia.    Kamuh explained that\n\nDaniel is well protected by the American corporation for which he\n\nworks and that his mother is periodically in hiding, but remains in\n\nIndonesia because she has been unable to obtain a visa.\n\n          Having heard this account, the IJ concluded that although\n\nKamuh's testimony was credible, he had not established that the\n\nincidents he described rose to the level of past persecution or\n\nestablished an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.\n\nThe IJ also found that Kamuh had failed to establish that the\n\nIndonesian government was unwilling or unable to control the Muslim\n\nmilitants. The IJ further concluded that Kamuh did not qualify for\n\nwithholding of removal or protection under the CAT, noting that\n\nthese require a higher level of proof than the asylum claim.2   The\n\nIJ granted Kamuh voluntary departure.   Kamuh appealed to the BIA,\n\nwhich briefly stated its agreement with the IJ's conclusions and\n\ndismissed the appeal.   This timely petition followed.\n\n                                II.\n\n          When the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ's ruling, but also\n\ndiscusses some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we consider both\n\nthe IJ's and BIA's opinions in our review.   Zheng v. Gonzales, 475\n\n\n     2\n      Kamuh offers no arguments with respect to his claims for\nwithholding of removal or protection under the CAT. As a result,\nhe has waived any right to judicial review of the denial of these\nclaims. See Topalli v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201738\"><a href=\"/opinion/201738/topalli-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131 n.3 (1st Cir.\n2005).\n\n                                -6-\n\fF.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2007).

As    the   IJ   noted,   the    State\n\nDepartment's 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and the\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report both indicate that the\n\nconstitution of Indonesia provides for religious freedom.                       Both\n\nreports also conclude that the government generally respects this\n\nprovision and that Christianity is officially acknowledged as one\n\nof several recognized religions.              Although the Religious Freedom\n\nReport states that \"[o]n some occasions, the Government tolerated\n\nthe abuse of religious freedom by private groups or failed to\n\npunish     perpetrators,\"   the    IJ    reasonably       concluded     that    this\n\ntolerance is not the norm.         See Matter of A-M 23 I & N Dec. 737,\n\n741 (BIA 2005) (noting that the 2002 Country Report for Indonesia\n\n\"indicate[d] that incidents of harm related to religious or ethnic\n\nstrife     generally    involved   fellow          citizens    rather   than    the\n\nGovernment or Government agents, and that Government acquiescence\n\n[was] not the norm\").       Indeed, the report goes on to detail the\n\ngovernment's efforts to investigate various incidents of violence\n\nby militant Muslims aimed at Christians and to prosecute those\n\ninvolved.\n\n             Moreover, Kamuh's account of his own experiences in\n\nIndonesia demonstrates that the government was both willing and\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fable to respond when authorities were alerted to interreligious\n\nviolence.    See Ortiz-Araniba, 505 F.3d at 42 (\"In determining\n\nwhether a government is willing and able to control persecutors, we\n\nhave explained that a prompt response by local authorities to prior\n\nincidents is 'the most telling datum.'\" (quoting Harutyunyan, 421\n\nF.3d at 68)).    The police responded to several of the incidents\n\nKamuh described: in December 1998, Kamuh's brother reportedly\n\nescaped from religious violence in Ambon with help from the police;\n\nin April 2001, Evert called police after learning of a plot to burn\n\nhis house, and the house was not burned; in July 2002 when Kamuh\n\nwas caught up in rioting in a market, the police quelled the\n\nviolence after Kamuh had left; and, in September 2002, police\n\narrived and took away the armed men who had come to Kamuh's\n\napartment building before the men arrived at Kamuh's apartment.\n\n            Against this backdrop, the IJ reasonably concluded that\n\nKamuh's insistence that the police \"side with the militants\" was\n\nunsubstantiated by the State Department reports and Kamuh's own\n\ntestimony.   Thus, we affirm the IJ's conclusion that Kamuh failed\n\nto establish the necessary connection between the mistreatment he\n\nexperienced or would experience in the future and any action or\n\ninaction on the part of the Indonesian government.    Without this\n\ngovernmental link, Kamuh cannot establish either past persecution\n\nor a well-founded fear of future persecution and his asylum claim\n\nnecessarily fails.\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fPetition denied.\n\n\n\n\n                   -10-\n\f</pre>",
