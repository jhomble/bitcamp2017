Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Edward E. Eliot for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Sandra R.\nBeckner, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           June 26, 2008\n\f             HOWARD, Circuit Judge.     Gary Hicks pled guilty to two\n\ncounts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B).     He seeks to have\n\nthat guilty plea invalidated on a number of grounds, all of them\n\nrelated to problems with his counsel and consequent irregularities\n\nin the proceedings surrounding his plea and sentencing.       We hold\n\ntwo of his allegations meritless and two others better suited for\n\ncollateral proceedings.    We therefore affirm the district court.\n\n                               I. Facts1\n\n             The defendant was indicted for selling crack cocaine on\n\ntwo occasions.2    Hicks's appointed counsel obtained a continuance\n\nto review the discovery, which included videotape of the drug\n\ntransactions.     Hicks received a proposed plea agreement from the\n\ngovernment, but it expired without his acceptance of the terms\n\nproposed.3    There is some disagreement about the extent of Hicks's\n\ndiscussions with his counsel about the plea agreement.          Hicks\n\ninitially told the district court that counsel met with him at\n\n\n1\n     Because one of Hicks's contentions is that his guilty plea was\nnot voluntary and intelligent, we will note differing versions of\nthe facts as we relate them. We do not, however, express thereby\nany opinion about the strength of Hicks's claim.\n2\n     The parties disagree about whether the buyer was a \"DEA agent\"\nor a \"DEA informant,\" but the disagreement is not material to our\ndiscussion.\n3\n     The government asserts that the proposed plea deal would have\nprevented the government from filing a sentence enhancement\ninformation pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851. Hicks claims on appeal\nthat the nature of the deal is unclear.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f10:30 in the morning saying the deal would be off the table at 4:00\n\nthat afternoon. On further questioning Hicks conceded that counsel\n\nhad gone over the plea agreement \"very quickly\" with him once prior\n\nto that date.4   Defense counsel stated for the record that he had\n\nmet with Hicks and discussed the plea agreement three separate\n\ntimes before the deadline passed.      In any event, the plea offer\n\nexpired, the government filed an information, and the case was set\n\nfor trial.\n\n          On the day of jury empanelment, Hicks addressed the\n\ncourt.   He offered to waive his speedy trial right in order to\n\nsecure a continuance, but the motion was denied. His counsel moved\n\nto withdraw.5    The district court questioned both Hicks and his\n\ncounsel about their relationship.     Hicks said he was dissatisfied\n\n\n4\n     As noted below, during the plea colloquy, Hicks again\nacknowledged that his counsel had reviewed the proposed plea\nagreement with him prior to the day it expired.\n5\n     Counsel said:\n               Early on during the course of my\n          conversations with this defendant, and because\n          of his lack of willingness to accept any of\n          the advice I have given him, I mentioned to\n          him that perhaps the thing I should do would\n          be to file a motion to withdraw.\n               In considering that myself personally, I\n          decided not to do that because I thought the\n          Court would be very reluctant to grant such a\n          motion. This afternoon when he was brought in\n          the courtroom, he asked me whether or not I\n          had made such a motion. I told him I had not.\n               Out of an abundance of caution and\n          because of his perceived distrust and lack of\n          cooperation with me and refusal to take my\n          advice, I would now make such a motion.\n\n                                -3-\n\fwith   counsel    because    of   the    short   timeline     for   accepting   or\n\nrejecting the plea deal, and because of counsel's advice that he\n\naccept the plea deal.        The district court assured Hicks that his\n\ncounsel was \"one of the most experienced criminal lawyers in the\n\nentire state\" and that \"if [he] is giving you legal advice, you can\n\nrest assured that he knows what he's talking about.\"                   The court\n\nthen denied the motion, saying, \"[I]f the reason you're asking him\n\nto get out of the case is because you don't agree with something\n\nthat was in the plea agreement, that's not a valid basis for me to\n\ngrant the motion.\"          Jury empanelment proceeded without further\n\nissue.\n\n             On the morning that the presentation of evidence was to\n\nbegin, Hicks once more expressed dissatisfaction with his counsel\n\nand declared that he did not wish to go forward with the trial.                 On\n\nfurther questioning by the court, Hicks asserted a conflict of\n\ninterest with counsel as well as a lack of confidence in counsel.\n\nThe district court put to Hicks that he had two choices:                     go to\n\ntrial with his appointed counsel or plead guilty without the\n\nbenefit of a plea agreement.            Hicks consulted with counsel twice,\n\nat   his   own   request.     Counsel      stated   that    Hicks   merely    kept\n\nrepeating that he did not wish to go forward with the trial.                  Once\n\nmore   the   district   court     assured      Hicks   that   his   counsel     was\n\ncompetent, calling him \"one of the five top criminal defense\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\flawyers in the state.\"        Hicks repeated that he did not have\n\nconfidence in his counsel.     He elaborated:\n\n            I don't think he's properly prepared. I told\n            him several times of witnesses that he should\n            subpoena for this trial. He has not mentioned\n            one witness that I told him about. . . . He\n            hasn't even conferred with me on how he's\n            going to defend me.    I think that's pretty\n            important.   I think I should know how I'm\n            going to be defended in a trial that has to do\n            with me. He came to visit me Friday for four\n            minutes. Four minutes.\n\n            The district court then directed counsel to confer with\n\nHicks and explain how he intended to conduct Hicks's defense.\n\nAfter this third conference, with Hicks still unwilling to proceed\n\nto trial, the district court began the plea colloquy.\n\n            During the plea colloquy Hicks elaborated on his lack of\n\nconfidence in his counsel.         He acknowledged that counsel had\n\npresented the plea agreement to him on two occasions, and admitted\n\nthat \"the plea agreement was, in turn, not that bad of a deal.\"           He\n\nexplained   that   counsel   did   warn   him   that   refusing   the   plea\n\nagreement might double his sentence, but that counsel had not been\n\nable to speak in concrete terms about the sentence Hicks might\n\nface.    The district court explained to Hicks that counsel was\n\nright.\n\n            Although Hicks said of his counsel, \"I don't blame him\n\nfor anything,\" later in the colloquy Hicks took issue with \"the way\n\nthe message was being delivered.\"         He said that although he had\n\nbeen arrested on May 15, counsel did not visit him until \"well\n\n                                   -5-\n\fafter\" June 26, despite what Hicks characterized as \"continuous\"\n\nrequests from Hicks's family members that counsel go and see him.\n\n           After the colloquy, the district court found Hicks's plea\n\nto be knowing, voluntary and intelligent and entered a judgment of\n\nguilty on both counts.    Sentencing was scheduled for December 1,\n\n2006.\n\n           At sentencing, the district court inquired as to several\n\nobjections Hicks made to the pre-sentence report.      One of these\n\nmerits discussion here.   Hicks, by himself, claimed that the plea\n\nshould be set aside as involuntary.    His counsel stated he did not\n\nknow of any ground on which he could argue that the plea was\n\ninvoluntary, and suggested that Hicks might wish to address this\n\nhimself.   The district court treated this as a motion to withdraw\n\na guilty plea and denied it, reiterating that the guilty plea had\n\nbeen knowing, voluntary and intelligent. After Hicks exercised his\n\nright of allocution, the district court sentenced him to the\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum: incarceration for 120 months followed\n\nby 8 years of supervised release.\n\n                           II. Discussion\n\n           Hicks raises several claims on appeal.   He contends that\n\nthe district court improperly participated in plea discussions by\n\nvouching for defense counsel and asserting that whatever advice he\n\nwas offering was sound advice.      In the specific context of this\n\ncase, Hicks argues, this amounted to judicial pressure to plead\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fguilty.    He also makes a cluster of arguments that all relate to\n\nthe adequacy of his representation: that the district court should\n\nhave allowed his counsel to withdraw and appointed new counsel,\n\nthat    counsel   was   ineffective,     and   that   the   guilty    plea   was\n\ninvoluntary because counsel's lack of trial preparation coerced the\n\nplea.\n\n            Our examination of the record convinces us that the\n\ndistrict court did not improperly participate in plea negotiations.\n\nNor did the district court abuse its discretion in refusing to\n\nallow counsel to withdraw.          The other claims, of coercion in his\n\nplea and ineffective assistance of counsel, are properly brought in\n\na collateral proceeding; the record here is insufficient to find\n\ninadequate representation, which is the issue central to the\n\nremaining claims.       Consequently, we affirm the district court.\n\nA. Improper judicial participation in plea negotiations\n\n            Hicks     claims    that   the     district     court    improperly\n\nparticipated in plea negotiations.6            He argues that the district\n\ncourt indirectly recommended that Hicks plead guilty when it told\n\nHicks that whatever advice counsel was giving him was good advice.\n\n            Federal     Rule   of   Criminal   Procedure    11   governs     plea\n\nnegotiations.       It permits the government and defendant's counsel\n\nto discuss a plea agreement and explicitly provides, \"The court\n\n\n\n6\n     Hicks cites neither Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 nor\nany cases decided thereunder, but we take this to be his argument.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fmust not participate in these discussions.\"                   Id. at § 11©).       In\n\nthis case, however, the district court's comment came in the\n\nabsence of any plea agreement discussions. Indeed, defense counsel\n\nadmitted that the proposed plea agreement had \"gone by the boards\n\nweeks ago.\"      Consequently, the strictures of Rule 11(c) are not\n\napplicable.\n\n            Judicial coercion of defendants to plead guilty, even in\n\nthe absence of plea agreement discussions, is a matter of serious\n\nconcern.7    Hicks cites Longval v. Meachum, 693 F.2d 236 (1st Cir.\n\n1982),    for   the   proposition      that     a    district    court     can   taint\n\nproceedings     by    impermissibly     pressuring        a   defendant     to   plead\n\nguilty.     That case held that comments from the bench that could\n\nhave created a \"reasonable apprehension of vindictiveness\" required\n\nremand for resentencing after the defendant declined the trial\n\njudge's invitation to plead, was convicted by a jury, and sentenced\n\nmuch more harshly than the plea agreement would have provided. Id.\n\nat 237 (quoting Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 28 (1974)).\n\nHere,     however,    there   is      nothing       to   support    that    kind    of\n\napprehension.         Contrary   to    Hicks's       assertion     on   appeal,    the\n\ndistrict court did not tell Hicks he \"should listen to [counsel's]\n\nadvice.\" Rather, the transcript reveals different language:                      \"He's\n\n\n7\n     Hicks does not venture beyond asserting that the district\ncourt's comments amounted to \"judicial coercion\": he cites no\nrelevant rule, and only one case. But we sketch the contours of\nour thinking in order to put to rest the idea that any impropriety\noccurred.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fgiven you advice. You can rest assured it's sound and good legal\n\nadvice.\"   Further, this was not in the context of whether to plead\n\nguilty or proceed to trial: it took place immediately before jury\n\nempanelment, with no deal on the table and no guilty plea on the\n\nhorizon.    The context was a motion to withdraw, and Hicks was\n\nexplaining why he wanted new counsel.      In this context, Hicks\n\noffered his prior disagreement with counsel's advice about the plea\n\nagreement as evidence that communications had broken down, and the\n\ndistrict court's response was addressed to that argument, not to\n\nthe merits of the expired plea deal, let alone to the merits of an\n\nopen plea no one anticipated.\n\nB. Adequacy of counsel\n\n           Four of Hicks's claims on appeal boil down to an attack\n\non the adequacy of his representation: 1) his appeal of the denial\n\nof counsel's motion to withdraw; 2) his ineffective assistance\n\nclaim based on a conflict of interest that allegedly arose when\n\nHicks refused his counsel's advice; 3) Hicks's assertion that a\n\nfailure to seek reinstatement of a lapsed offer for a plea bargain\n\nwas ineffective assistance of counsel; and 4) his contention that\n\nthe guilty plea was involuntary because it was coerced by counsel's\n\nineffective representation. The first of these we can resolve; the\n\nothers we will not address on direct review.     We sketch Hicks's\n\nasserted problems with his counsel before discussing each claim in\n\nturn.\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f          In   general,   although   Hicks   claimed   his   counsel   was\n\nunprepared, he offers only his observation that counsel had not\n\nsubpoenaed the witnesses Hicks had proposed.        Without more, this\n\nmight reflect a difference of opinion about trial strategy, but not\n\na lack of preparation amounting to ineffective assistance.         Hicks\n\nalleges no admission by his counsel that counsel was in fact\n\nunprepared.    Nor did counsel represent to the court that he was\n\nunready for trial.     The district court noted that counsel had\n\nrepresented Hicks ably at every step of the process up to trial.\n\nWithout specific, colorable allegations, Hicks could not convince\n\nthe district court that counsel was unready, nor can he convince\n\nus. Hicks alleges that communication had broken down, but the only\n\nbreakdown on the record is that Hicks did not like the advice he\n\nwas getting.   We address each of Hicks's specific arguments below,\n\nbut they all suffer from the same infirmity: there is no evidence\n\nthat his counsel failed in his duties.\n\n          First, Hicks argues that the district court should have\n\ngranted counsel's motion to withdraw.        In our view, the district\n\ncourt appropriately inquired of both Hicks and his counsel to\n\ndetermine the nature and extent of the problem, and decided the\n\nmatter well within its discretion.8     In reviewing the denial of a\n\n\n8\n     Because we find Hicks's claim unavailing on direct review in\nany event, we need not adopt the position, urged by the government,\nthat under the Tollett doctrine a guilty plea constitutes a waiver\nof the right to appeal a motion for substitute counsel or a motion\nto withdraw. See Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973)\n\n                                 -10-\n\fmotion for new appointed counsel, or a motion to withdraw in a case\n\nwith appointed counsel, we examine \"(1) the timeliness of the\n\nmotion;   (2)     the    adequacy     of   the    court's     inquiry     into   the\n\ndefendant's complaint; and (3) whether the conflict between the\n\ndefendant and his counsel was so great that it resulted in a total\n\nlack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\"                      United\n\nStates v. Van Anh, 523 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Allen, 789 F.2d\n\n90, 92 (1st Cir. 1986)) (articulating test in the context of denial\n\nof motion for new counsel); see United States v. Reyes, 352 F.3d\n\n511, 515 (1st Cir. 2003) (applying same test for counsel's motion\n\nto   withdraw).         Here,   the   motion     was   made   the   day    of    jury\n\nempanelment, the district court conducted a thorough inquiry, and\n\nthe record does not show a complete breakdown of communication.\n\nAccordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying the motion to withdraw.\n\n\n(holding that a guilty plea waives later challenge to racial\ncomposition of grand jury). The government urges us to follow the\ntrail blazed by the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Foreman, 329\nF.3d 1037, 1038-39 (9th Cir. 2003). That case held that a guilty\nplea constituted a waiver of the right to appeal a denial of a\nmotion for substitute counsel. But Foreman was careful to exclude\nfrom its holding cases where the voluntariness of the guilty plea\nwas also attacked. Id. at 1039 (\"[T]he right to appeal a pre-plea\nmotion for substitution is waived by an unconditional plea, unless\nthe plea itself is challenged.\" (emphasis added)).      Hicks does\nchallenge the voluntariness of his guilty plea. These matters are\nbetter left for collateral proceedings, but we note in passing that\nthe Sixth Amendment right to counsel is closely linked to the\nguilty plea itself, and therefore this case presents a less\ncomfortable fit for the strictures of Tollett.\n\n                                       -11-\n\f            Next, Hicks argues that his refusal to heed counsel's\n\nadvice to plead guilty created a conflict of interest that only\n\ndeepened   every    time   Hicks   expressed     his   dissatisfaction   with\n\ncounsel.    Due to this conflict of interest, Hicks claims, he did\n\nnot receive the effective representation that is his right under\n\nthe Sixth Amendment.\n\n            We have on occasion entertained such claims on direct\n\nappeal, but only when facts point to specific, colorable evidence\n\nof actual misconduct.       See United States v. Segarra-Rivera, 473\n\nF.3d 381, 385 (1st Cir. 2007) (direct review of conflict of\n\ninterest appropriate where there is a colorable claim of actual\n\nmisconduct).       In   Segarra-Rivera,    for   instance,   the   defendant\n\nalleged that his guilty plea had been coerced by his counsel, who\n\nhad \"ambushed\" him with a visit from his tearful wife, refused to\n\nleave without a signed plea agreement, and was wholly unprepared\n\nfor trial.     Counsel then argued against his client's motion to\n\nwithdraw the guilty plea, pointing out flaws in the motion and\n\nintimating that witnesses could prove his client's guilt.             Id. at\n\n383-84.    We remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the conflict of\n\ninterest issue, relying on our conclusion that the misconduct\n\nalleged was more than professional negligence.9           Because Hicks has\n\n\n9\n     Segarra-Rivera concerned only whether the district court erred\nin refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing with new counsel on the\nconflict-of-interest claim, and did not address the merits of the\nclaim. After remand and a hearing, Segarra abandoned his motion to\nwithdraw his guilty plea, and the district court cleared original\n\n                                    -12-\n\fmade   no   such    showing,    this    claim      must   await   a     collateral\n\nproceeding.\n\n            Hicks also confronts the adequacy of his counsel more\n\nsquarely in advancing two garden-variety ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claims.       He claims that when he elected to plead guilty\n\nafter the jury had been empaneled the morning of trial, counsel\n\nshould have requested that the government again extend to Hicks its\n\noriginal offer; he further claims that counsel should have filed a\n\nformal motion to withdraw the guilty plea. These alleged lapses as\n\nwell must be presented first to the trial court for factual\n\ndevelopment.       Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 505 (2003)\n\n(\"[I]neffective-assistance claims ordinarily will be litigated in\n\nthe first instance in the district court, the forum best suited to\n\ndeveloping the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of\n\nrepresentation       during    an   entire      trial.\").         \"In    all   but\n\nextraordinary      circumstances,      .   .   .    a   claim   of    ineffective\n\nassistance that is raised for the first time in this court will not\n\nbe entertained.\"      United States v. Martins, 413 F.3d 139, 155 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).

He seeks to have that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> guilty plea invalidated on a number of grounds, all of them related to problems with his counsel and consequent irregularities in the proceedings surrounding his plea and sentencing. We hold two of his allegations meritless and two others better suited for collateral proceedings. We therefore affirm the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts<sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>The defendant was indicted for selling crack cocaine on two occasions.<sup>[2]</sup> Hicks's appointed counsel obtained a continuance to review the discovery, which included videotape of the drug transactions. Hicks received a proposed plea agreement from the government, but it expired without his acceptance of the terms proposed.<sup>[3]</sup> There is some disagreement about the extent of Hicks's discussions with his counsel about the plea agreement. Hicks initially told the district court that counsel met with him at 10:30 in the morning saying the deal would be off the table at 4:00 that afternoon. On further questioning Hicks conceded that counsel had gone over the plea agreement \"very quickly\" with him once prior to that date.<sup>[4]</sup> Defense counsel stated for the record that he had met with Hicks and discussed the plea agreement three separate times before the deadline passed. In any event, the plea offer expired, the government filed an information, and the case was set for trial.</p>\n<p>On the day of jury empanelment, Hicks addressed the court. He offered to waive his speedy trial right in order to secure a continuance, but the motion was denied. His counsel moved to withdraw.<sup>[5]</sup> The district court questioned both Hicks and his counsel about their relationship. Hicks said he was dissatisfied with counsel because of the short timeline for accepting or rejecting the plea deal, and because of counsel's advice that he accept the plea deal. The district court assured Hicks that his counsel was \"one of the most experienced criminal lawyers in the entire state\" and that \"if [he] is giving you legal advice, you can rest assured that he knows what he's talking about.\" The court then denied the motion, saying, \"[I]f the reason you're asking him to get out of the case is because you don't agree with something that was in the plea agreement, that's not a valid basis for me to grant the motion.\" Jury empanelment proceeded without further issue.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> On the morning that the presentation of evidence was to begin, Hicks once more expressed dissatisfaction with his counsel and declared that he did not wish to go forward with the trial. On further questioning by the court, Hicks asserted a conflict of interest with counsel as well as a lack of confidence in counsel. The district court put to Hicks that he had two choices: go to trial with his appointed counsel or plead guilty without the benefit of a plea agreement. Hicks consulted with counsel twice, at his own request. Counsel stated that Hicks merely kept repeating that he did not wish to go forward with the trial. Once more the district court assured Hicks that his counsel was competent, calling him \"one of the five top criminal defense lawyers in the state.\" Hicks repeated that he did not have confidence in his counsel. He elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote>I don't think he's properly prepared. I told him several times of witnesses that he should subpoena for this trial. He has not mentioned one witness that I told him about.... He hasn't even conferred with me on how he's going to defend me. I think that's pretty important. I think I should know how I'm going to be defended in a trial that has to do with me. He came to visit me Friday for four minutes. Four minutes.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court then directed counsel to confer with Hicks and explain how he intended to conduct Hicks's defense. After this third conference, with Hicks still unwilling to proceed to trial, the district court began the plea colloquy.</p>\n<p>During the plea colloquy Hicks elaborated on his lack of confidence in his counsel. He acknowledged that counsel had presented the plea agreement to him on two occasions, and admitted that \"the plea agreement was, in turn, not that bad of a deal.\" He explained that counsel did warn him that refusing the plea agreement might double his sentence, but that counsel had not been able to speak in concrete terms about the sentence Hicks might face. The district court explained to Hicks that counsel was right.</p>\n<p>Although Hicks said of his counsel, \"I don't blame him for anything,\" later in the colloquy Hicks took issue with \"the way the message was being delivered.\" He said that although he had been arrested on May 15, counsel did not visit him until \"well after\" June 26, despite what Hicks characterized as \"continuous\" requests from Hicks's family members that counsel go and see him.</p>\n<p>After the colloquy, the district court found Hicks's plea to be knowing, voluntary and intelligent and entered a judgment of guilty on both counts. Sentencing was scheduled for December 1, 2006.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the district court inquired as to several objections Hicks made to the pre-sentence report. One of these merits discussion here. Hicks, by himself, claimed that the plea should be set aside as involuntary. His counsel stated he did not know of any ground on which he could argue that the plea was involuntary, and suggested that Hicks might wish to address this himself. The district court treated this as a motion to withdraw a guilty plea and denied it, reiterating that the guilty plea had been knowing, voluntary and intelligent. After Hicks exercised his right of allocution, the district court sentenced him to the statutory mandatory minimum: incarceration for 120 months followed by 8 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>Hicks raises several claims on appeal. He contends that the district court improperly participated in plea discussions by vouching for defense counsel and asserting that whatever advice he was offering was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> sound advice. In the specific context of this case, Hicks argues, this amounted to judicial pressure to plead guilty. He also makes a cluster of arguments that all relate to the adequacy of his representation: that the district court should have allowed his counsel to withdraw and appointed new counsel, that counsel was ineffective, and that the guilty plea was involuntary because counsel's lack of trial preparation coerced the plea.</p>\n<p>Our examination of the record convinces us that the district court did not improperly participate in plea negotiations. Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in refusing to allow counsel to withdraw. The other claims, of coercion in his plea and ineffective assistance of counsel, are properly brought in a collateral proceeding; the record here is insufficient to find inadequate representation, which is the issue central to the remaining claims. Consequently, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Improper judicial participation in plea negotiations</h2>\n<p>Hicks claims that the district court improperly participated in plea negotiations.<sup>[6]</sup> He argues that the district court indirectly recommended that Hicks plead guilty when it told Hicks that whatever advice counsel was giving him was good advice.</p>\n<p>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 governs plea negotiations. It permits the government and defendant's counsel to discuss a plea agreement and explicitly provides, \"The court must not participate in these discussions.\" <i>Id.</i> at § 11(c). In this case, however, the district court's comment came in the absence of any plea agreement discussions. Indeed, defense counsel admitted that the proposed plea agreement had \"gone by the boards weeks ago.\" Consequently, the strictures of Rule 11(c) are not applicable.</p>\n<p>Judicial coercion of defendants to plead guilty, even in the absence of plea agreement discussions, is a matter of serious concern.<sup>[7]</sup> Hicks cites <i>Longval v. Meachum,</i> 693 F.2d 236 (1st Cir.1982), for the proposition that a district court can taint proceedings by impermissibly pressuring a defendant to plead guilty. That case held that comments from the bench that could have created a \"reasonable apprehension of vindictiveness\" required remand for resentencing after the defendant declined the trial judge's invitation to plead, was convicted by a jury, and sentenced much more harshly than the plea agreement would have provided. <i>Id.</i> at 237 (quoting <i>Blackledge v. Perry,</i> 417 U.S. 21, 28, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974)). Here, however, there is nothing to support that kind of apprehension. Contrary to Hicks's assertion on appeal, the district court did not tell Hicks he \"should listen to [counsel's] advice.\" Rather, the transcript reveals different language: \"He's given you advice. You can rest assured it's sound and good legal advice.\" Further, this was not in the context of whether to plead guilty or proceed to trial: it took place immediately before jury empanelment, with no deal on the table and no guilty plea on the horizon. The context was a motion to withdraw, and Hicks was explaining why he wanted new counsel. In this context, Hicks offered his prior disagreement with counsel's advice about the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> plea agreement as evidence that communications had broken down, and the district court's response was addressed to that argument, not to the merits of the expired plea deal, let alone to the merits of an open plea no one anticipated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Adequacy of counsel</h2>\n<p>Four of Hicks's claims on appeal boil down to an attack on the adequacy of his representation: 1) his appeal of the denial of counsel's motion to withdraw; 2) his ineffective assistance claim based on a conflict of interest that allegedly arose when Hicks refused his counsel's advice; 3) Hicks's assertion that a failure to seek reinstatement of a lapsed offer for a plea bargain was ineffective assistance of counsel; and 4) his contention that the guilty plea was involuntary because it was coerced by counsel's ineffective representation. The first of these we can resolve; the others we will not address on direct review. We sketch Hicks's asserted problems with his counsel before discussing each claim in turn.</p>\n<p>In general, although Hicks claimed his counsel was unprepared, he offers only his observation that counsel had not subpoenaed the witnesses Hicks had proposed. Without more, this might reflect a difference of opinion about trial strategy, but not a lack of preparation amounting to ineffective assistance. Hicks alleges no admission by his counsel that counsel was in fact unprepared. Nor did counsel represent to the court that he was unready for trial. The district court noted that counsel had represented Hicks ably at every step of the process up to trial. Without specific, colorable allegations, Hicks could not convince the district court that counsel was unready, nor can he convince us. Hicks alleges that communication had broken down, but the only breakdown on the record is that Hicks did not like the advice he was getting. We address each of Hicks's specific arguments below, but they all suffer from the same infirmity: there is no evidence that his counsel failed in his duties.</p>\n<p>First, Hicks argues that the district court should have granted counsel's motion to withdraw. In our view, the district court appropriately inquired of both Hicks and his counsel to determine the nature and extent of the problem, and decided the matter well within its discretion.<sup>[8]</sup> In reviewing the denial of a motion for new appointed counsel, or a motion to withdraw in a case with appointed counsel, we examine \"(1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) the adequacy of the court's inquiry into the defendant's complaint; and (3) whether the conflict between the defendant and his counsel was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> preventing an adequate defense.\" <i>United States v. Van Anh,</i> 523 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir.1986)) (articulating test in the context of denial of motion for new counsel); <i>see </i><i>United States v. Reyes,</i> 352 F.3d 511, 515 (1st Cir.2003) (applying same test for counsel's motion to withdraw). Here, the motion was made the day of jury empanelment, the district court conducted a thorough inquiry, and the record does not show a complete breakdown of communication. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p>Next, Hicks argues that his refusal to heed counsel's advice to plead guilty created a conflict of interest that only deepened every time Hicks expressed his dissatisfaction with counsel. Due to this conflict of interest, Hicks claims, he did not receive the effective representation that is his right under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>We have on occasion entertained such claims on direct appeal, but only when facts point to specific, colorable evidence of actual misconduct. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Segarra-Rivera,</i> 473 F.3d 381, 385 (1st Cir.2007) (direct review of conflict of interest appropriate where there is a colorable claim of actual misconduct). In <i>Segarra-Rivera,</i> for instance, the defendant alleged that his guilty plea had been coerced by his counsel, who had \"ambushed\" him with a visit from his tearful wife, refused to leave without a signed plea agreement, and was wholly unprepared for trial. Counsel then argued <i>against</i> his client's motion to withdraw the guilty plea, pointing out flaws in the motion and intimating that witnesses could prove his client's guilt. <i>Id.</i> at 383-84. We remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the conflict of interest issue, relying on our conclusion that the misconduct alleged was more than professional negligence.<sup>[9]</sup> Because Hicks has made no such showing, this claim must await a collateral proceeding.</p>\n<p>Hicks also confronts the adequacy of his counsel more squarely in advancing two garden-variety ineffective assistance of counsel claims. He claims that when he elected to plead guilty after the jury had been empaneled the morning of trial, counsel should have requested that the government again extend to Hicks its original offer; he further claims that counsel should have filed a formal motion to withdraw the guilty plea. These alleged lapses as well must be presented first to the trial court for factual development. <i>Massaro v. United States,</i> 538 U.S. 500, 505, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (\"[I]neffective-assistance claims ordinarily will be litigated in the first instance in the district court, the forum best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial.\"). \"In all but extraordinary circumstances,... a claim of ineffective assistance that is raised for the first time in this court will not be entertained.\" <i>United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139, 155 (1st Cir.2005). Although this is not an absolute rule, we are not confronted here with one of the \"cases in which trial counsel's ineffectiveness is so apparent from the record that\" the issue may be decided on direct appeal. <i>Massaro,</i> 538 U.S. at 508, 123 S.Ct. 1690.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hicks claims that because his counsel was unprepared for trial, his guilty <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> plea was involuntary and the district court committed reversible error in finding otherwise, an error the court compounded when it denied Hicks's motion to withdraw his guilty plea at sentencing. This claim logically depends on the allegations of misconduct, conflict of interest and ineffective assistance in the other claims, and so must fare as they do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>\"`We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.'\" <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 410 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Mala,</i> 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993)). Hicks may choose to pursue his allegations that his counsel was conflicted and ineffective in a collateral proceeding. Regardless, on direct review, there is not enough to support his claims. The district court neither abused its discretion in denying counsel's motion to withdraw, nor improperly participated in plea negotiations. <i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Because one of Hicks's contentions is that his guilty plea was not voluntary and intelligent, we will note differing versions of the facts as we relate them. We do not, however, express thereby any opinion about the strength of Hicks's claim.</p>\n<p>[2]  The parties disagree about whether the buyer was a \"DEA agent\" or a \"DEA informant,\" but the disagreement is not material to our discussion.</p>\n<p>[3]  The government asserts that the proposed plea deal would have prevented the government from filing a sentence enhancement information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851. Hicks claims on appeal that the nature of the deal is unclear.</p>\n<p>[4]  As noted below, during the plea colloquy, Hicks again acknowledged that his counsel had reviewed the proposed plea agreement with him prior to the day it expired.</p>\n<p>[5]  Counsel said:\n</p>\n<p>Early on during the course of my conversations with this defendant, and because of his lack of willingness to accept any of the advice I have given him, I mentioned to him that perhaps the thing I should do would be to file a motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p>In considering that myself personally, I decided not to do that because I thought the Court would be very reluctant to grant such a motion. This afternoon when he was brought in the courtroom, he asked me whether or not I had made such a motion. I told him I had not.</p>\n<p>Out of an abundance of caution and because of his perceived distrust and lack of cooperation with me and refusal to take my advice, I would now make such a motion.</p>\n<p>[6]  Hicks cites neither Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 nor any cases decided thereunder, but we take this to be his argument.</p>\n<p>[7]  Hicks does not venture beyond asserting that the district court's comments amounted to \"judicial coercion\": he cites no relevant rule, and only one case. But we sketch the contours of our thinking in order to put to rest the idea that any impropriety occurred.</p>\n<p>[8]  Because we find Hicks's claim unavailing on direct review in any event, we need not adopt the position, urged by the government, that under the <i>Tollett</i> doctrine a guilty plea constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal a motion for substitute counsel or a motion to withdraw. <i>See </i><i>Tollett v. Henderson,</i> 411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973) (holding that a guilty plea waives later challenge to racial composition of grand jury). The government urges us to follow the trail blazed by the Ninth Circuit in <i>United States v. Foreman,</i> 329 F.3d 1037, 1038-39 (9th Cir.2003). That case held that a guilty plea constituted a waiver of the right to appeal a denial of a motion for substitute counsel. But <i>Foreman</i> was careful to exclude from its holding cases where the voluntariness of the guilty plea was also attacked. <i>Id.</i> at 1039 (\"[T]he right to appeal a pre-plea motion for substitution is waived by an unconditional plea, <i>unless the plea itself is challenged.</i>\" (emphasis added)). Hicks does challenge the voluntariness of his guilty plea. These matters are better left for collateral proceedings, but we note in passing that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is closely linked to the guilty plea itself, and therefore this case presents a less comfortable fit for the strictures of <i>Tollett.</i></p>\n<p>[9]  <i>Segarra-Rivera</i> concerned only whether the district court erred in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing with new counsel on the conflict-of-interest claim, and did not address the merits of the claim. After remand and a hearing, Segarra abandoned his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and the district court cleared original counsel of any impropriety. <i>United States v. Segarra-Rivera,</i> 485 F.Supp.2d 21, 22 (D.P.R.2007).</p>\n\n</div>",

Meachum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411116\"><a href=\"/opinion/411116/norman-l-longval-v-lawrence-r-meachum/\"><span class=\"volume\">693</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1982), for the proposition that a district court can taint proceedings by impermissibly pressuring a defendant to plead guilty. That case held that comments from the bench that could have created a \"reasonable apprehension of vindictiveness\" required remand for resentencing after the defendant declined the trial judge's invitation to plead, was convicted by a jury, and sentenced much more harshly than the plea agreement would have provided. <i>Id.</i> at 237 (quoting <i>Blackledge v. Perry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109042\"><a href=\"/opinion/109042/blackledge-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 28, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109042\"><a href=\"/opinion/109042/blackledge-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2098</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109042\"><a href=\"/opinion/109042/blackledge-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></a></span> (1974)). Here, however, there is nothing to support that kind of apprehension. Contrary to Hicks's assertion on appeal, the district court did not tell Hicks he \"should listen to [counsel's] advice.\" Rather, the transcript reveals different language: \"He's given you advice. You can rest assured it's sound and good legal advice.\" Further, this was not in the context of whether to plead guilty or proceed to trial: it took place immediately before jury empanelment, with no deal on the table and no guilty plea on the horizon. The context was a motion to withdraw, and Hicks was explaining why he wanted new counsel. In this context, Hicks offered his prior disagreement with counsel's advice about the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> plea agreement as evidence that communications had broken down, and the district court's response was addressed to that argument, not to the merits of the expired plea deal, let alone to the merits of an open plea no one anticipated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Adequacy of counsel</h2>\n<p>Four of Hicks's claims on appeal boil down to an attack on the adequacy of his representation: 1) his appeal of the denial of counsel's motion to withdraw; 2) his ineffective assistance claim based on a conflict of interest that allegedly arose when Hicks refused his counsel's advice; 3) Hicks's assertion that a failure to seek reinstatement of a lapsed offer for a plea bargain was ineffective assistance of counsel; and 4) his contention that the guilty plea was involuntary because it was coerced by counsel's ineffective representation. The first of these we can resolve; the others we will not address on direct review. We sketch Hicks's asserted problems with his counsel before discussing each claim in turn.</p>\n<p>In general, although Hicks claimed his counsel was unprepared, he offers only his observation that counsel had not subpoenaed the witnesses Hicks had proposed. Without more, this might reflect a difference of opinion about trial strategy, but not a lack of preparation amounting to ineffective assistance. Hicks alleges no admission by his counsel that counsel was in fact unprepared. Nor did counsel represent to the court that he was unready for trial. The district court noted that counsel had represented Hicks ably at every step of the process up to trial. Without specific, colorable allegations, Hicks could not convince the district court that counsel was unready, nor can he convince us. Hicks alleges that communication had broken down, but the only breakdown on the record is that Hicks did not like the advice he was getting. We address each of Hicks's specific arguments below, but they all suffer from the same infirmity: there is no evidence that his counsel failed in his duties.</p>\n<p>First, Hicks argues that the district court should have granted counsel's motion to withdraw. In our view, the district court appropriately inquired of both Hicks and his counsel to determine the nature and extent of the problem, and decided the matter well within its discretion.<sup>[8]</sup> In reviewing the denial of a motion for new appointed counsel, or a motion to withdraw in a case with appointed counsel, we examine \"(1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) the adequacy of the court's inquiry into the defendant's complaint; and (3) whether the conflict between the defendant and his counsel was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> preventing an adequate defense.\" <i>United States v. Van Anh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203238\"><a href=\"/opinion/203238/united-states-v-van-anh/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>United States v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469060\"><a href=\"/opinion/469060/united-states-v-norman-c-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.1986)) (articulating test in the context of denial of motion for new counsel); <i>see </i><i>United States v. Reyes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200778\"><a href=\"/opinion/200778/united-states-v-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 515 (1st Cir.2003) (applying same test for counsel's motion to withdraw). Here, the motion was made the day of jury empanelment, the district court conducted a thorough inquiry, and the record does not show a complete breakdown of communication. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p>Next, Hicks argues that his refusal to heed counsel's advice to plead guilty created a conflict of interest that only deepened every time Hicks expressed his dissatisfaction with counsel. Due to this conflict of interest, Hicks claims, he did not receive the effective representation that is his right under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>We have on occasion entertained such claims on direct appeal, but only when facts point to specific, colorable evidence of actual misconduct. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Segarra-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202590\"><a href=\"/opinion/202590/united-states-v-segarra-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 385 (1st Cir.2007) (direct review of conflict of interest appropriate where there is a colorable claim of actual misconduct). In <i>Segarra-Rivera,</i> for instance, the defendant alleged that his guilty plea had been coerced by his counsel, who had \"ambushed\" him with a visit from his tearful wife, refused to leave without a signed plea agreement, and was wholly unprepared for trial. Counsel then argued <i>against</i> his client's motion to withdraw the guilty plea, pointing out flaws in the motion and intimating that witnesses could prove his client's guilt. <i>Id.</i> at 383-84. We remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the conflict of interest issue, relying on our conclusion that the misconduct alleged was more than professional negligence.<sup>[9]</sup> Because Hicks has made no such showing, this claim must await a collateral proceeding.</p>\n<p>Hicks also confronts the adequacy of his counsel more squarely in advancing two garden-variety ineffective assistance of counsel claims. He claims that when he elected to plead guilty after the jury had been empaneled the morning of trial, counsel should have requested that the government again extend to Hicks its original offer; he further claims that counsel should have filed a formal motion to withdraw the guilty plea. These alleged lapses as well must be presented first to the trial court for factual development. <i>Massaro v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127915\"><a href=\"/opinion/127915/massaro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>, 505, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127915\"><a href=\"/opinion/127915/massaro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span> (2003) (\"[I]neffective-assistance claims ordinarily will be litigated in the first instance in the district court, the forum best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial.\"). \"In all but extraordinary circumstances,... a claim of ineffective assistance that is raised for the first time in this court will not be entertained.\" <i>United States v. Martins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201656\"><a href=\"/opinion/201656/united-states-v-martins/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 155 (1st Cir.2005). Although this is not an absolute rule, we are not confronted here with one of the \"cases in which trial counsel's ineffectiveness is so apparent from the record that\" the issue may be decided on direct appeal. <i>Massaro,</i> 538 U.S. at 508, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127915\"><a href=\"/opinion/127915/massaro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1690</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hicks claims that because his counsel was unprepared for trial, his guilty <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> plea was involuntary and the district court committed reversible error in finding otherwise, an error the court compounded when it denied Hicks's motion to withdraw his guilty plea at sentencing. This claim logically depends on the allegations of misconduct, conflict of interest and ineffective assistance in the other claims, and so must fare as they do.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>\"`We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.'\" <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202599\"><a href=\"/opinion/202599/united-states-v-leahy/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 410 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Mala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir.1993)). Hicks may choose to pursue his allegations that his counsel was conflicted and ineffective in a collateral proceeding. Regardless, on direct review, there is not enough to support his claims. The district court neither abused its discretion in denying counsel's motion to withdraw, nor improperly participated in plea negotiations. <i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Because one of Hicks's contentions is that his guilty plea was not voluntary and intelligent, we will note differing versions of the facts as we relate them. We do not, however, express thereby any opinion about the strength of Hicks's claim.</p>\n<p>[2]  The parties disagree about whether the buyer was a \"DEA agent\" or a \"DEA informant,\" but the disagreement is not material to our discussion.</p>\n<p>[3]  The government asserts that the proposed plea deal would have prevented the government from filing a sentence enhancement information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851. Hicks claims on appeal that the nature of the deal is unclear.</p>\n<p>[4]  As noted below, during the plea colloquy, Hicks again acknowledged that his counsel had reviewed the proposed plea agreement with him prior to the day it expired.</p>\n<p>[5]  Counsel said:\n</p>\n<p>Early on during the course of my conversations with this defendant, and because of his lack of willingness to accept any of the advice I have given him, I mentioned to him that perhaps the thing I should do would be to file a motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p>In considering that myself personally, I decided not to do that because I thought the Court would be very reluctant to grant such a motion. This afternoon when he was brought in the courtroom, he asked me whether or not I had made such a motion. I told him I had not.</p>\n<p>Out of an abundance of caution and because of his perceived distrust and lack of cooperation with me and refusal to take my advice, I would now make such a motion.</p>\n<p>[6]  Hicks cites neither Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 nor any cases decided thereunder, but we take this to be his argument.</p>\n<p>[7]  Hicks does not venture beyond asserting that the district court's comments amounted to \"judicial coercion\": he cites no relevant rule, and only one case. But we sketch the contours of our thinking in order to put to rest the idea that any impropriety occurred.</p>\n<p>[8]  Because we find Hicks's claim unavailing on direct review in any event, we need not adopt the position, urged by the government, that under the <i>Tollett</i> doctrine a guilty plea constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal a motion for substitute counsel or a motion to withdraw. <i>See </i><i>Tollett v. Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108762\"><a href=\"/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 267, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108762\"><a href=\"/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1602</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108762\"><a href=\"/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span> (1973) (holding that a guilty plea waives later challenge to racial composition of grand jury). The government urges us to follow the trail blazed by the Ninth Circuit in <i>United States v. Foreman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782051\"><a href=\"/opinion/782051/united-states-v-conrad-foreman/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1037</span></a></span>, 1038-39 (9th Cir.2003). That case held that a guilty plea constituted a waiver of the right to appeal a denial of a motion for substitute counsel. But <i>Foreman</i> was careful to exclude from its holding cases where the voluntariness of the guilty plea was also attacked. <i>Id.</i> at 1039 (\"[T]he right to appeal a pre-plea motion for substitution is waived by an unconditional plea, <i>unless the plea itself is challenged.</i>\" (emphasis added)). Hicks does challenge the voluntariness of his guilty plea. These matters are better left for collateral proceedings, but we note in passing that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is closely linked to the guilty plea itself, and therefore this case presents a less comfortable fit for the strictures of <i>Tollett.</i></p>\n<p>[9]  <i>Segarra-Rivera</i> concerned only whether the district court erred in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing with new counsel on the conflict-of-interest claim, and did not address the merits of the claim. After remand and a hearing, Segarra abandoned his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and the district court cleared original counsel of any impropriety. <i>United States v. Segarra-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416081\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416081/united-states-v-segarra-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
