Likewise, it cannot be said that\n                          \n\ncollateral   authority  has   since  emerged   of  sufficient\n\npersuasiveness  to offer  \"a convincing reason  for believing\n\n                             -2-\n\nthat the earlier panel ... would change its course.\"  Metcalf\n                                                             \n\n&amp; Eddy,  Inc.,  943 F.2d  at  12.
