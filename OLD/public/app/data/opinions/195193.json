Respondent John Doe has refused to testify\n                \n\nbefore  a  grand jury  investigating alleged  organized crime\n\nfigures,  explaining that he was fearful of reprisals against\n\nhimself  and  his family  and  was  opposed on  principle  to\n\nproviding evidence against  others.  The district  court held\n\nrespondent in  civil contempt  and ordered him  incarcerated.\n\nIt  found that his  proffered explanations failed  to provide\n\n\"just cause\"  for his recalcitrance, see 28 U.S.C.   1826(a),\n                                        \n\nand  that incarceration  was reasonably  likely  to induce  a\n\nchange of heart.   On appeal, respondent now  challenges this\n\ndetermination  on procedural  grounds:  he alleges  that  the\n\ndistrict court abridged his right to a meaningful evidentiary\n\nhearing by restricting his ability to present live testimony.\n\nWe disagree and therefore affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     In  September 1993, in  response to a  subpoena from the\n\ngrand  jury, respondent  indicated that  he  would refuse  to\n\ntestify.  His  reasons apparently  included a  desire not  to\n\nincriminate himself, for the government thereafter obtained a\n\ncourt  order  granting  him  immunity  and  ordering  him  to\n\ntestify.  On November 18, respondent was again called  before\n\nthe  grand jury.   Despite  the  court order,  and despite  a\n\ngovernment   offer  to  place  him  in  the  federal  witness\n\nprotection  program,  respondent  reiterated  his refusal  to\n\n                             -2-\n\ntestify.  The government thereupon filed the instant petition\n\nfor contempt.\n\n     The district  court held  three hearings  on the  matter\n\nduring the first  week of December.   Respondent there sought\n\nto establish that there was no realistic possibility  that he\n\nwould  ever testify,  such that  his  incarceration would  be\n\npunitive  rather  than  coercive and  thus  violative  of due\n\nprocess.   Respondent himself took  the stand and  so stated,\n\nreaffirming  that  he  was  fearful  of  reprisals  and  that\n\ntestifying was not  \"the right thing to do.\"   This testimony\n\ncame  in response  to queries  from  the court;  respondent's\n\ncounsel   declined   an   invitation   to   conduct   further\n\nexamination.   Beyond this,  respondent sought permission  to\n\nsecure testimony from the following four individuals, for the\n\nreasons indicated: \n\n          (1) A witness who had  earlier appeared before\n     the  grand jury and  had since entered  the witness\n     protection program.    It was  proffered that  this\n     witness   was  the   source  of   the  government's\n     information about respondent  and so could  testify\n     as to the need for his testimony, as well as to the\n     dangers posed by the targets of the investigation; \n\n          (2) A  state trooper, present  under subpoena,\n     who likewise could document such dangers; \n\n          (3) Another trooper, also under subpoena,  who\n     could testify that respondent, following his arrest\n     for a drug  offense in 1990, rejected  a government\n     offer of leniency in exchange  for his cooperation;\n     and \n\n          (4)   Respondent's   sister,  who   could   explain\n     respondent's unwillingness ever to jeopardize the safety\n     of his family. \n\n                             -3-\n\n     The district court  declined to hear such  testimony, at\n\nleast in the first instance.  Instead, it directed respondent\n\nto  submit appropriate affidavits  (where feasible) or offers\n\nof proof,  indicating that it  would reconsider the  need for\n\nlive testimony upon  review of such submissions.   Respondent\n\naccordingly filed  four affidavits from friends and relatives\n\nopining that  he  would never  testify, one  from his  former\n\nattorney describing  the events surrounding his  1990 arrest,\n\nand   one  from  his   current  attorney  attesting   to  the\n\ndangerousness  of the  grand  jury  targets  as  depicted  in\n\nnewspaper accounts.   The court  subsequently concluded  that\n\nsuch  procedures were sufficient both to satisfy the dictates\n\nof due process and to  provide a suitable basis for decision.\n\nBased  on  respondent's  testimony  and  the  sundry  written\n\nsubmissions,   it   found   a   reasonable  likelihood   that\n\nincarceration  would  eventually   succeed  in  coercing  his\n\ntestimony.  Respondent  was therefore ordered confined  for a\n\nperiod of eighteen months, until the  expiration of the grand\n\njury's  term,  or  until  he  purged  himself  of  contempt--\n\nwhichever occurred first.   Respondent now contends  that, by\n\nlimiting the scope of the evidentiary presentation, the court\n\ndeprived  him  of  a meaningful  opportunity  to  explain the\n\ngravity and sincerity of his fears of reprisal,  in violation\n\nof due process.   We review the decision  below for abuse  of\n\n                             -4-\n\ndiscretion.  See,  e.g., In re Grand Jury  Proceedings (Doe),\n                                                            \n\n943 F.2d 132, 136 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam). \n\n                             II.\n\n     Respondent's  desire to document the nature and scope of\n\nhis  fears   was  not   necessarily   inappropriate  to   the\n\nproceedings below.  Of course, it has been widely held that a\n\nwitness' fear of reprisal against himself or  his family does\n\nnot constitute  just cause  for refusing  to  testify.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., Piemonte v. United States, 367 U.S. 556, 559 n.2 (1961)\n                               \n\n(dicta); Doe, 943 F.2d at 135 (listing cases); In re Farrell,\n                                                            \n\n611  F.2d  923,  924-25  (1st  Cir.  1979).1    Yet  a  civil\n\ncontemnor's  incarceration  can   be  transformed  from   the\n\npermissibly  coercive  into  the  improperly  punitive  where\n\n\"there  is no realistic possibility that  he will comply with\n\nthe order to testify.\"   In re Grand Jury, 851  F.2d 499, 502\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1988) (per curiam); accord, e.g.,  Simkin v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 715 F.2d 34, 37 (2d Cir. 1983).  And some courts have\n      \n\nindicated  that fear  of  reprisal  can  be  relevant,  under\n\ncertain  circumstances, to  the determination of  whether any\n\n                    \n\n1.  As the Ninth Circuit has explained: \n\n     Were  it  otherwise,  any  person  involved with  a\n     criminal  enterprise could  point  to the  possible\n     danger  that comes from giving testimony.  The more\n     vicious  or   sophisticated  the   enterprise,  the\n     greater  the danger.   Thus, grand juries  would be\n     deprived of information when they most needed it.  \n\nIn re  Grand Jury  Proceedings (Lahey),  914 F.2d  1372, 1375\n                                      \n(9th Cir. 1990).  \n\n                             -5-\n\nsuch possibility  exists.    See,  e.g.,  In  re  Grand  Jury\n                                                             \n\nProceedings  Empanelled May 1988  (Freligh I), 894  F.2d 881,\n                                             \n\n883-85  (7th Cir. 1989) (duress, demonstrated by reference to\n\npalpable, imminent danger, might constitute equitable defense\n\nto  civil contempt); In re Grand  Jury Proceedings (Doe), 862\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 430, 432  (2d Cir. 1988) (per curiam)  (fear of reprisal\n\nis  one  factor  to  be  considered  in  determining  whether\n\n\"confinement will produce  the desired effect\"); In  re Grand\n                                                             \n\nJury Proceedings (Gravel), 605 F.2d 750,  752 (5th Cir. 1979)\n                         \n\n(per  curiam)  (fear  of reprisal  is  \"legitimate  factor in\n\nmitigation\").\n\n     We need  not further  explore the  applicability of  any\n\nsuch  \"duress\"  defense,  however, for  it  is  apparent that\n\nrespondent was afforded ample  opportunity to adduce evidence\n\nwith  respect thereto.   We  have noted  that, where  a civil\n\ncontemnor  is faced with incarceration, \"due process has been\n\nconsidered   by  many  courts   to  require  an  'uninhibited\n\nadversary  hearing'   where  the  witness   can  'probe   all\n\nnonfrivolous  defenses to the contempt charge.'\"  In re Grand\n                                                             \n\nJury Proceedings  (Campaigner Publications,  Inc.), 795  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n226, 234 (1st Cir. 1986),  cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1064 (1987)\n                                       \n\n(quoting United  States v.  Alter, 482  F.2d 1016,  1024 (9th\n                                 \n\nCir.  1973)).  Yet this requirement  is subject to reasonable\n\nlimitations,  depending on the  circumstances involved.  See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., In re Bianchi, 542 F.2d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 1976) (\"While\n                   \n\n                             -6-\n\na witness must  be given a meaningful opportunity  to present\n\nhis  defense ...,  this summary  procedure  does not  require\n\nmeaningless  formalities that would  only serve to  delay the\n\nproceedings.\").  Where  there is no genuine  factual dispute,\n\nor  where  proposed  third-party  testimony  will  likely  be\n\nrepetitive or  of marginal  relevance, a  court may  properly\n\ncall for offers of proof or otherwise restrict the ability to\n\ncall  witnesses.     See,  e.g.,  In  re  Grand  Jury  Matter\n                                                             \n\n(Backiel), 906 F.2d  78, 85-86 (3d  Cir.), cert. denied,  498\n                                                       \n\nU.S. 980 (1990);  Campaigner Publications, Inc., 795  F.2d at\n                                               \n\n235; In re  Kitchen, 706 F.2d 1266, 1273 (2d Cir. 1983).  The\n                   \n\ncourt's discretion in this regard is \"very broad.\"  Id.\n                                                       \n\n     Far  from  constituting  an  abuse  of  discretion,  the\n\nprocedure  followed by the district court here was abundantly\n\nfair.2  At  the first hearing, the court granted respondent's\n\nrequest for a continuance to permit further  preparation.  At\n\nthe  second,  respondent  was  permitted  to testify  without\n\nlimitation.  We note that, to the extent the nature and scope\n\n                    \n\n2.  In  the  related  context where  contemnors  have  sought\nrelease from  custody on  the ground  that incarceration  had\n       \nlost  its  coercive  effect, the  Second  Circuit  has upheld\norders  reached  on   the  basis  of  far   more  abbreviated\nproceedings.  See  Sanchez v. United States, 725  F.2d 29, 32\n                                           \n(2d   Cir.  1984)  (based  on  witness'  affidavit  and  oral\nargument);  Simkin v.  United States,  715 F.2d  at 38  &amp; n.2\n                                    \n(based on witness' affidavit  only).  Indeed, the  court went\nso  far  as to  say  that  \"a  district judge  has  virtually\nunreviewable discretion both as to the procedures he will use\nto  reach  his  conclusion,  and  as to  the  merits  of  his\nconclusion.\"  Id. at 38 (footnote  omitted).  See also In  re\n                                                             \nCrededio, 759 F.2d 589, 591-92 (7th Cir. 1985).  \n        \n\n                             -7-\n\nof  his fears  of reprisal  were  not fully  elucidated, such\n\nfailure is largely attributable to the fact that respondent's\n\ncounsel   declined   the   invitation   to  conduct   further\n\nexamination.   Thereafter,  respondent  was afforded  time to\n\nsubmit affidavits  from, or  offers of  proof regarding,  the\n\nproposed third-party witnesses and others.  \n\n     Respondent's principal contention--that  the court erred\n\nin preventing such witnesses from taking the stand--fails for\n\nseveral  reasons.     First,  the   testimony  of   relatives\n\nconcerning  respondent's refusal to  jeopardize the safety of\n\nhis family would have been cumulative--and was, in any event,\n\nadequately proffered by way of affidavit.  Second, the events\n\nsurrounding respondent's 1990  arrest were likewise described\n\nin an affidavit.  Respondent could have elaborated thereon in\n\nhis own testimony but did not.  We are left to speculate what\n\ncould have  been  added by  the  testimony of  the  arresting\n\nofficer.3   Third, any  evidence regarding the  necessity for\n\n                    \n\n3.  To the extent such evidence was  intended to buttress his\nassertion that  he would never  testify against  others as  a\nmatter  of principle,  it was  of  marginal relevance.   See,\n                                                            \ne.g., Backiel, 906  F.2d at 88 (\"moral beliefs\"  do not alter\n             \nduty to testify); In re Crededio, 759  F.2d 589, 593 n.2 (7th\n                                \nCir.  1985) (same).  Compare In  re Parrish, 782 F.2d 325 (2d\n                                           \nCir. 1986)  (affirming  decision to  release contemnor  after\nseven months'  confinement due  to lack  of coercive  effect;\nwitness had claimed that to answer grand jury questions would\nbe betrayal of \"black liberation movement\").  \n     We  also note  that respondent's disinclination  to turn\nagainst his drug  confederates in public fashion in  1990 has\nscant bearing  on  what  actions he  might  take  within  the\nprivate  confines of  the  grand  jury.   There  has been  no\nsuggestion here that  the secrecy of the grand  jury has been\n\n                             -8-\n\nrespondent's  testimony before the grand jury would have been\n\nirrelevant.  There is no requirement that the government show\n\neither \"that the  information it hopes to obtain  from Doe is\n\nsignificant [or]  that that information  is unavailable  from\n\nother sources.\"  Doe, 862 F.2d at 431; accord, e.g., Backiel,\n                                                            \n\n906 F.2d at  87-88 (grand jury \"is free  to pursue cumulative\n\nleads\"); In re Grand Jury, 851 F.2d at 502 (same).\n                         \n\n     Finally, prospective testimony as to the danger posed by\n\nthe  targets  of  the  investigation  would  have  been  both\n\ncumulative and of  minimal relevance.  The court  accepted as\n\nan offer of  proof counsel's affidavit and  various newspaper\n\narticles  exploring this  issue at  length.   The  government\n\neffectively  conceded the matter,  and the court  expressed a\n\nreadiness to assume it to be true.    Yet all this proves  to\n\nhave  been largely  beside the  point in  any event,  for two\n\nreasons.  To have any relevance  at all in this context, fear\n\nof  reprisal  must  be  based  on  more  than  simply  vague,\n\nunsubstantiated apprehension.  Rather, as the Seventh Circuit\n\nhas  held, such fear  must be \"genuine\"  and \"reasonable,\" as\n\ndemonstrated by  reference  to  \"palpable  imminent  danger.\"\n\nFreligh  I,  894 F.2d  at  883;  see also  In  re Grand  Jury\n                                                             \n\nProceedings of  December 1989  (Freligh II),  903 F.2d  1167,\n                                           \n\n                    \n\njeopardized.

As a result, prior to issuing\na contempt citation, the  court required that the grand  jury\nbe informed of the reasons for the witness' recalcitrance and\nthat  it  then   make  an   explicit  request   that  he   be\nincarcerated.  Id. at 427.   Respondent can derive no comfort\n                  \nfrom this decision.  The fact that one court chooses,  in the\nexercise of  discretion, to  adopt such  safeguards does  not\nmean that  another court's  failure to  do so  constitutes an\nabuse of discretion.  \n\n                             -10-\n\n     Finally,  we  find no  error  in  the  substance of  the\n\ndistrict  court's  finding  that  incarceration will  have  a\n\nrealistic possibility of  causing respondent to testify.   As\n\nrespondent  has not challenged this finding directly, we note\n\nonly  the following.   The  determination to  be made  by the\n\ndistrict   court  in  this   regard  \"is  far   removed  from\n\ntraditional factfinding\"--the court \"is  obliged to look into\n\nthe future and gauge, not  what will happen, but the prospect\n                                                             \n\nthat something  will happen.\"   In re Parrish, 782  F.2d 325,\n                                             \n\n327  (2d Cir.  1986) (emphasis  in original).   \"Even  if the\n\njudge  concludes that it is the contemnor's present intention\n\nnever  to  testify,  that conclusion  does  not  preclude the\n\npossibility that continued confinement will cause the witness\n\nto  change his mind.\"   Simkin v.

Given the \"speculative\"  nature of such inquiry, United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nSimkin  v.  United   States,  715  F.2d  at   38  (\"virtually\n                           \n\nunreviewable discretion\"). \n\n     The court  here conducted  a careful  evaluation of  the\n\nindividual  circumstances  pertaining   to  respondent.    It\n\nproperly  discounted   the  claim  that   respondent  (having\n\nrecently completed a three-year term on the drug offense) was\n\nsufficiently familiar with  prison life as to  render further\n\n                             -11-\n\nincarceration  noncoercive.

It properly determined  that his family ties might\n\neventually induce a change of heart.

Respondent John Doe has refused to testify\n                \n\nbefore  a  grand jury  investigating alleged  organized crime\n\nfigures,  explaining that he was fearful of reprisals against\n\nhimself  and  his family  and  was  opposed on  principle  to\n\nproviding evidence against  others.  The district  court held\n\nrespondent in  civil contempt  and ordered him  incarcerated.\n\nIt  found that his  proffered explanations failed  to provide\n\n\"just cause\"  for his recalcitrance, see 28 U.S.C.   1826(a),\n                                        \n\nand  that incarceration  was reasonably  likely  to induce  a\n\nchange of heart.   On appeal, respondent now  challenges this\n\ndetermination  on procedural  grounds:  he alleges  that  the\n\ndistrict court abridged his right to a meaningful evidentiary\n\nhearing by restricting his ability to present live testimony.\n\nWe disagree and therefore affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     In  September 1993, in  response to a  subpoena from the\n\ngrand  jury, respondent  indicated that  he  would refuse  to\n\ntestify.  His  reasons apparently  included a  desire not  to\n\nincriminate himself, for the government thereafter obtained a\n\ncourt  order  granting  him  immunity  and  ordering  him  to\n\ntestify.  On November 18, respondent was again called  before\n\nthe  grand jury.   Despite  the  court order,  and despite  a\n\ngovernment   offer  to  place  him  in  the  federal  witness\n\nprotection  program,  respondent  reiterated  his refusal  to\n\n                             -2-\n\ntestify.  The government thereupon filed the instant petition\n\nfor contempt.\n\n     The district  court held  three hearings  on the  matter\n\nduring the first  week of December.   Respondent there sought\n\nto establish that there was no realistic possibility  that he\n\nwould  ever testify,  such that  his  incarceration would  be\n\npunitive  rather  than  coercive and  thus  violative  of due\n\nprocess.   Respondent himself took  the stand and  so stated,\n\nreaffirming  that  he  was  fearful  of  reprisals  and  that\n\ntestifying was not  \"the right thing to do.\"   This testimony\n\ncame  in response  to queries  from  the court;  respondent's\n\ncounsel   declined   an   invitation   to   conduct   further\n\nexamination.   Beyond this,  respondent sought permission  to\n\nsecure testimony from the following four individuals, for the\n\nreasons indicated: \n\n          (1) A witness who had  earlier appeared before\n     the  grand jury and  had since entered  the witness\n     protection program.    It was  proffered that  this\n     witness   was  the   source  of   the  government's\n     information about respondent  and so could  testify\n     as to the need for his testimony, as well as to the\n     dangers posed by the targets of the investigation; \n\n          (2) A  state trooper, present  under subpoena,\n     who likewise could document such dangers; \n\n          (3) Another trooper, also under subpoena,  who\n     could testify that respondent, following his arrest\n     for a drug  offense in 1990, rejected  a government\n     offer of leniency in exchange  for his cooperation;\n     and \n\n          (4)   Respondent's   sister,  who   could   explain\n     respondent's unwillingness ever to jeopardize the safety\n     of his family. \n\n                             -3-\n\n     The district court  declined to hear such  testimony, at\n\nleast in the first instance.  Instead, it directed respondent\n\nto  submit appropriate affidavits  (where feasible) or offers\n\nof proof,  indicating that it  would reconsider the  need for\n\nlive testimony upon  review of such submissions.   Respondent\n\naccordingly filed  four affidavits from friends and relatives\n\nopining that  he  would never  testify, one  from his  former\n\nattorney describing  the events surrounding his  1990 arrest,\n\nand   one  from  his   current  attorney  attesting   to  the\n\ndangerousness  of the  grand  jury  targets  as  depicted  in\n\nnewspaper accounts.   The court  subsequently concluded  that\n\nsuch  procedures were sufficient both to satisfy the dictates\n\nof due process and to  provide a suitable basis for decision.\n\nBased  on  respondent's  testimony  and  the  sundry  written\n\nsubmissions,   it   found   a   reasonable  likelihood   that\n\nincarceration  would  eventually   succeed  in  coercing  his\n\ntestimony.  Respondent  was therefore ordered confined  for a\n\nperiod of eighteen months, until the  expiration of the grand\n\njury's  term,  or  until  he  purged  himself  of  contempt--\n\nwhichever occurred first.   Respondent now contends  that, by\n\nlimiting the scope of the evidentiary presentation, the court\n\ndeprived  him  of  a meaningful  opportunity  to  explain the\n\ngravity and sincerity of his fears of reprisal,  in violation\n\nof due process.   We review the decision  below for abuse  of\n\n                             -4-\n\ndiscretion.  See,  e.g., In re Grand Jury  Proceedings (Doe),\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567590\"><a href=\"/opinion/567590/in-re-grand-jury-proceedings-united-states-of-america-v-john-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam). \n\n                             II.\n\n     Respondent's  desire to document the nature and scope of\n\nhis  fears   was  not   necessarily   inappropriate  to   the\n\nproceedings below.
