The government seized, and seeks\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nto condemn,  twenty-nine cartons  of undiluted black  currant oil\n\n(BCO),  in  capsule  form,  owned  by  claimant-appellee  Oakmont\n\nInvestment Co. (Oakmont), alleging that BCO is a food additive of\n\nquestionable safety.   Because we believe  that encapsulated BCO,\n\nintended to be ingested as purchased, cannot properly be termed a\n\nfood  additive as defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic\n\nAct (the  Act), as amended, 21  U.S.C.    301 et  seq. (1988), we\n                                                      \n\naffirm the district court's dismissal  of the government's in rem\n                                                                 \n\ncomplaint.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          On October  11, 1988, the  United States Food  and Drug\n\nAdministration  (FDA)  seized 200  bottles  of encapsulated  BCO,\n\npacked in  twenty-nine  cartons, and  brought  an in  rem  action\n                                                         \n\ncontending  that, under  21 U.S.C.    342(a)(2)(C),  the capsules\n\nshould be condemned as \"adulterated\" food  because they contain a\n\n\"food additive,\" the BCO, that Oakmont had not proven to be safe.\n\n          At   the  ensuing  bench   trial,  certain  facts  were\n\nuncontradicted.   BCO is  a  liquid obtained  by squeezing  black\n\ncurrant berry  seeds.   It is  composed of  polyunsaturated fatty\n\nacids.   In  its pure  liquid  form, it  can be  ingested by  the\n\nspoonful  as a dietary supplement.   However, Oakmont markets BCO\n\nin  capsules which  are  to be  swallowed  whole.   The  capsules\n\ncontain pure BCO   nothing more.   They are made from gelatin and\n\nglycerin (or  an equivalent plasticizer) and  have no independent\n\nnutritional  value.  Rather, a capsule serves a dual purpose as a\n\n                                2\n\ncontainer  (enabling consumers to ingest predetermined quantities\n\nof  BCO in solid form) and as  a prophylactic (protecting the BCO\n\nfrom rancidity).\n\n          On these and other  facts, the district court dismissed\n\nthe  government's complaint  and  ordered the  capsules released.\n\nSee United States v. 29 Cartons,  Etc., 792 F. Supp. 139, 142 (D.\n                                      \n\nMass. 1992).  The court reasoned that when, as in  this case, BCO\n\ncomprises the only active ingredient within a gelatin capsule, it\n\ncan  properly  be classified  as  a \"food,\"  but  not as  a \"food\n\nadditive.\"   See id.  at 141-42.   Accordingly, the FDA  erred in\n                    \n\nseizing the bottles on the  ground that they \"allegedly contain[]\n\nan unsafe food additive.\"  Id. at 142.\n                              \n\n          When the  FDA appealed,  the district court  stayed its\n\nrelease order.\n\nII.  THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE\n\n          To put  this case  into workable perspective,  we first\n\nreview the relevant statutory provisions.  The Act defines \"food\"\n\nas:\n\n          (1) articles  used for food or  drink for man\n          or other  animals, (2)  chewing gum,  and (3)\n          articles  used  for  components  of  any such\n          article.\n\n21 U.S.C.   321(f).   The FDA concedes that pure BCO  (sold, say,\n\nas  a bottled  liquid)  falls within  section  321(f)(1) and  is,\n\ntherefore, \"food.\"  Substances  classified as \"food\" are presumed\n\nsafe.  Thus, the FDA can prevent sale of bottled BCO or any other\n\n\"food\" only if it proves by a preponderance of the  evidence that\n\nthe food is \"injurious to health.\"   21 U.S.C.   342(a)(1);  see,\n                                                                \n\n                                3\n\ne.g.,  United States v. Lexington  Mill &amp; Elevator  Co., 232 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n399, 411 (1914); United States v. An Article of Food [FoodScience\n                                                                 \n\nLabs., Inc.], 678 F.2d 735, 741 n.3 (7th  Cir. 1982) (Cudahy, J.,\n            \n\nconcurring).    Although   the  FDA  suspects  that  BCO  may  be\n\nunhealthful, it is unable  at the present time to  translate this\n\nsuspicion into legally competent proof.\n\n          In  addition to regulating the sale of food per se, the\n                                                            \n\nAct contains  provisions anent food additives.   These provisions\n\nare  designed to  protect consumers  against the  introduction of\n\nuntested  and  potentially  unsafe  substances, such  as  flavor,\n\ntexture, or preservative agents, into food.  A gloss was added to\n\nthe treatment of food additives in 1958.  See Pub. L. No. 85-929,\n                                             \n\n72 Stat.  1784  (1958)  (codified in  scattered  sections  of  21\n\nU.S.C.).   Unlike section  342(a)(1), which places  the burden of\n\nproving injuriousness  upon the  government in respect  to foods,\n\nthe  food   additives  amendment   allocates  the   burden  quite\n\ndifferently:  the FDA can prevent the sale of products containing\n\na food additive  unless and  until the processor  shows that  the\n\nsubstance, when added  to food, is  generally recognized as  safe\n\n(in the  vernacular, \"GRAS\").  See S.  Rep. No. 2422, 85th Cong.,\n                                  \n\n2d  Sess. (1958),  reprinted in  1958 U.S.C.C.A.N.  5300, 5301-02\n                               \n\n(explaining  the  processor's burden  \"of  proving  that a  newly\n\ndiscovered substance  which . . . [is] add[ed] to the food we eat\n\nis  safe\").  Thus, in contrast to  the Act's treatment of \"food,\"\n\nany  substance  that  meets  the  Act's  definition  of  a  \"food\n\nadditive\"  is presumed to be \"unsafe\" under 21 U.S.C.   348 until\n\n                                4\n\nthe  FDA,  or more  particularly,  the Commissioner  of  Food and\n\nDrugs,  has  promulgated  a  regulation   prescribing  conditions\n\nassuring safe  use.   See  21  U.S.C.    348(a)(2); 21  C.F.R.   \n                         \n\n5.10(a)(1) (1992).\n\n          The 1958 amendment defines a food additive in pertinent\n\npart as:\n\n          any  substance  the  intended  use  of  which\n          results  or  may  reasonably be  expected  to\n          result,  directly  or   indirectly,  in   its\n          becoming a component  or otherwise  affecting\n          the  characteristics  of any  food (including\n          any substance intended for use  in producing,\n          manufacturing,      packing,      processing,\n          preparing, treating, packaging, transporting,\n          or holding food; and including any  source of\n          radiation intended for any such use), if such\n          substance is not generally  recognized, among\n          experts qualified by scientific  training and\n          experience  to evaluate its safety, as having\n          been  adequately   shown  through  scientific\n          procedures  .  .  .  to  be  safe  under  the\n          conditions of its intended use . . . .\n\n21  U.S.C.    321(s).   To be  labeled a  food additive,  then, a\n\nsubstance must (1) be intended, or reasonably expected, to become\n\na component of food or to otherwise affect the characteristics of\n\nfood, and (2) not be GRAS.\n\n          The Act  thus creates  a distinction between  foods and\n\nfood additives which  has meaningful  consequences for  purveyors\n\nand for the  public.  The distinction also  significantly affects\n\nthe ease with which the FDA may regulate a substance's sale.\n\nIII.  THE ISSUE\n\n          This appeal revolves around the question of whether the\n\nFDA or Oakmont must carry out the research necessary to show that\n\nBCO is, or is not, GRAS.  The issue reduces to whether  pure BCO,\n\n                                5\n\nwhen sold in  encapsulated form,  must be regulated  as a  \"food\"\n\nwithin  the meaning  of section  321(f) or  as a  \"food additive\"\n\nwithin the meaning of section 321(s).\n\n          The  meat of  the parties'  disagreement lies  in their\n\ndiffering interpretations of that portion of the Act which states\n\nthat  a substance  can  be a  food additive  if its  intended use\n\nresults,  or  may  be expected  to  result,  \"in  its becoming  a\n\ncomponent  or  otherwise  affecting the  characteristics  of  any\n\nfood.\"  21  U.S.C.   321(s).1  The FDA  reads the quoted language\n\nas  creating  two  independent  and disjunctive  standards:    to\n\nsatisfy  the  first prong  of  the  food additive  definition,  a\n\nsubstance  must either  (1)  be  a  component  of  food,  or  (2)\n\notherwise  affect  the characteristics  of  food.   Because  each\n\nconstituent part or element of a food (that is, each \"component\")\n\nnecessarily affects the food's characteristics, the FDA considers\n\nevery component, at least potentially, see  infra note 3, to be a\n                                                 \n\nfood  additive.2  Drawing on this interpretation, the FDA asserts\n\nthat  the  seized  capsules  are  composed  of  three  consumable\n\ncomponents   BCO,  gelatin, and glycerin    and that,  therefore,\n\neach  of   these  three  ingredients  is   subject  to  potential\n\n                    \n\n     1The  district court  bifurcated the  trial and,  during the\ninitial phase, determined only  that BCO does not meet  the first\nprong  of the  bipartite  food additive  definition.   Thus,  the\ndistrict court had no  occasion to reach the second  prong, viz.,\n                                                                \nwhether BCO is GRAS.  Hence, that issue is not before us.\n\n     2In  the  FDA's view,  the  second  of the  two  independent\nstandards  confers potential food  additive status  on substances\nthat,  while  they  are not  constituent  parts  of  a food,  may\nnevertheless have deleterious effects on food.  One example might\nbe chemicals used in packaging food.\n\n                                6\n\nregulation as a food additive.3\n\n          As  Oakmont  parses  the  statute, it  creates  only  a\n\nsingle, unitary food additive standard.  The phrase \"or otherwise\n\naffecting  the  characteristics  of  any  food\"  signals  that  a\n\ncomponent is potentially a  food additive only if it  affects the\n\ncharacteristics of  some food to  which it is added.   Unlike the\n\nFDA's  interpretation,  Oakmont's   interpretation  attaches   no\n\nsignificance to a substance's  mere presence as a component  of a\n\nwhole.   It focuses instead on the substance's affirmative use in\n\na way that affects food.\n\n          Applying its interpretation of the statute to the facts\n\nat  bar, Oakmont  argued below,  as  it does  here, that  the BCO\n\ncontained  in the  seized capsules  is itself  a food  and  not a\n\ncomponent  of some other  food, that it is  intended so to serve,\n\nand  that  its  sale in  a  convenient  carrier  medium does  not\n\ntransmogrify it  into a food additive.   In holding that  food is\n\ndefined \"by  its 'use[] for  food,'\" 29 Cartons, 792  F. Supp. at\n                                               \n\n141  (quoting 21  U.S.C.    321(f)), whereas  a food  additive is\n\ndefined by its effect on another substance, see id., the district\n                                                   \n\ncourt substantially adopted Oakmont's reading  of the law and its\n\nfocus on a substance's intended function.\n\n          In specific terms, then,  we must determine whether, as\n\nthe FDA would have it, any element of any substance that has more\n                                         \n\n                    \n\n     3We use the adjectival modifier \"potential\"  because gelatin\nand glycerin are concededly GRAS.  Hence, these components cannot\nbe classified as  food additives because neither can  fulfill the\ndefinition's second prong.\n\n                                7\n\nthan  one component may be  branded a food  additive, or, rather,\n\nwhether,  as Oakmont  urges and  the court  below believed,  such\n\ntreatment  should be reserved for elements  which, when so added,\n\neffect  a change  (or, at  least, could be  expected to  effect a\n\nchange) in some other active ingredient.\n\nIV.  FOOD FOR THOUGHT\n\n          The  Seventh  Circuit  has  recently  grappled  with  a\n\nfactually  similar case presenting  this very issue.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Two Plastic Drums, Etc.,      F.2d     (7th Cir. 1993)\n                                  \n\n[No. 92-1172].   Employing a perspicacious analysis  of the Act's\n\ntext and legislative history, the court rejected the FDA's notion\n\nthat  all   components  of  a  substance   are  necessarily  food\n         \n\nadditives.   The court observed  that the \"'or otherwise'\" phrase\n\ncontained in the statutory definition of a  food additive targets\n\nonly  those components  that  \"have  the  purpose  or  effect  of\n\naltering a food's  characteristics.\"  Id. at     [slip  op. at 6-\n                                         \n\n7].    The  subsequent  enumeration  of  sample  food  additives,\n\ndescribing  each substance by its \"function or by [its] effect on\n\nfood,\" makes it clear that an additive must stimulate some change\n\nin  a food to  which it is  added.  Id.  at     [slip  op. at 6].\n                                       \n\nTurning  to the legislative history, the  court observed that the\n\nFDA's broad definition of  a food additive, which would  apply to\n\nall components, even a substance which comprises  the only active\n\ningredient   of  the   whole,  subverts   congressional  purpose.\n\nBlurring the distinction between food additives  and food in this\n\nway would  permit  the  agency  to  tilt  a  delicately  balanced\n\n                                8\n\nstatutory  scheme  that  allocates   the  burden  of  proving  an\n\nadditive's safety to  the processors while leaving  the burden of\n\nestablishing a food's safety with the  FDA.

Thus, in order\n\nto  qualify as a  food additive, a  component must be  added to a\n\nfood in order  to change that food's properties.   See id. at    \n                                                          \n\n[slip op. at 7-8].  On that basis, pure BCO, in  capsule form, is\n\nnot a food additive.  See id. at     [slip op. at 11]. \n                             \n\n          Judges should hesitate to write lengthy opinions merely\n\nfor the sake  of committing their own prose to  posterity.  Given\n\nthe existence  of  a  cogent,  well-reasoned,  eminently  correct\n\nopinion closely on  point, we  embrace it.   We will,  therefore,\n\naffirm  the   judgment  below   for  substantially   the  reasons\n\nelucidated in  Two  Plastic Drums.   We  pause, nevertheless,  to\n                                 \n\nessay a few additional observations.\n\n          First:    We are  reluctant  to  believe that  Congress\n          First:\n               \n\ntraffics in absurdities.   Since  it defies common  sense to  say\n\n                                9\n\nthat a  substance  can be  a  \"food additive\"  when  there is  no\n\n(other)  food  to which  it is  added,  we think  that  the FDA's\n\nreading of the Act is nonsensical, and, hence, must be incorrect.\n\nMoreover,  classifying BCO as a  \"component\" merely because it is\n\ncombined with  two totally inert  substances serving collectively\n\nas a  carrier medium would  itself create a bizarre  paradox:  as\n\nthe Seventh  Circuit noted, \"to hold  that BCO is  a component of\n\nthe dietary supplement  would be to find that BCO  is a component\n\nof itself.\"  Two Plastic Drums,     F.2d at     [slip op. at 5].\n                              \n\n          Second:    In  the  FDA's   estimation,  a  processor's\n          Second:\n                \n\n\"subjective  intent\"  that only  one  of  a product's  components\n\nconstitutes  the food is irrelevant because  \"it is the objective\n                                                                 \n\nintended use, i.e., the intent to combine two or more components,\n                  \n\nthat  counts.\"   Appellant's  Brief at  11.   But,  this harangue\n\nmisses  the mark.  We  fully agree that  a processor's subjective\n\ndetermination of what constitutes a food  is not determinative in\n\ncases of this stripe     but neither is the naked  fact that more\n\nthan one component  has been  combined.  In  the final  analysis,\n\nwhat  counts is the use of an  ingredient for its effect on food.\n\nHere, from an objective standpoint, BCO is not being used for its\n\neffect on gelatin  and glycerine.   Thus, contrary  to the  FDA's\n\nloudly expressed fears, eschewing  its rendition of the statutory\n\ntext will not supplant objectivity with subjectivity.4\n\n                    \n\n     4Moreover, if the  FDA worries that processors  may muck the\nstatutory  classifications with convenient recitals of subjective\nintent,  we question the agency's  espousal of a  rule that would\n\"arbitrarily classify a substance as either food or food additive\nby how it  is marketed rather than by  the nature and use  of the\n\n                                10\n\n          Third:    The  FDA  also maintains  that  because  \"the\n          Third:\n               \n\ningredients  of  multi-ingredient  food products,  such  as  cake\n\nmixes,\" indisputably fall  within the  food additive  definition,\n\nthe  statute could  not possibly  contain a  \"requirement  that a\n\nsubstance must be  added to a preexisting food, which  it must be\n                                         \n\nshown actually to affect.\"  Appellant's Brief at 9.  We disagree.\n\nCake mixes are foods composed of many interacting food additives,\n\neach with  its particular effect on  the whole.5  Absent  any one\n\ningredient, the  concoction remains a  cake mix, albeit  one that\n\nmay be  short on sweetness or  lumpy in texture.   In that sense,\n\ncake mixes and products of that ilk are a far cry from a  dietary\n\nsupplement  composed  of  a   single  active  ingredient.    What\n\ndifferentiates  this case is that, if the  BCO is removed, one is\n\nleft with nothing but an empty capsule.\n\n          Fourth:   We  think it  advisable to mention  the FDA's\n          Fourth:\n                \n\ninsistence, citing Chevron U. S. A.  Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n837, 843 (1984), that we must obey its interpretation of the Act.\n\nIn  our estimation, the purely  legal question facing  us in this\n\ncase  presents no  occasion  for deference.    In this  realm  of\n\njudicial expertise,  the courts,  not the  agency, have  the last\n\n                    \n\nsubstance itself.\"  Two Plastic Drums,      F.2d at     [slip op.\n                                     \nat 9].   In the words  of Sir Francis Bacon,  the FDA's suggested\n\"remedy is worse than the disease.\"\n\n     5We  do not quarrel with  those courts that  have held, when\nconfronted with multi-ingredient products containing  two or more\nactive ingredients, that each  active ingredient is potentially a\nfood additive.

When, as\n                 \n\nnow,  a court  is  persuaded neither  by  \"the validity  of  [the\n\nagency's]  reasoning,\" nor  by the  interpretive fit  between the\n\nagency's  rendition,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  language and\n\nstructure of  the statute, on the other  hand, a court should not\n\ndefer.6  Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944).\n                                \n\n                    \n\n     6The longevity of an  agency's position is often significant\nin  assaying the degree  of deference owed  to it.   See Bowen v.\n                                                              \nGeorgetown  Univ.

Here, the\nFDA's  position  is of  recent  vintage.    Indeed, the  original\ncomplaint in this action  pinned food additive status not  on BCO\nbut  on gamma linolenic acid, BCO's fatty acid constituent.  And,\nin  a prior case  involving blue-green  algae in  gelatin capsule\nform,  the FDA argued that  the blue-green algae  was an additive\n\n                                12\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need go no further.  The proposition that placing a\n\nsingle-ingredient  food  product  into  an  inert  capsule  as  a\n\nconvenient method  of ingestion  converts that  food into a  food\n\nadditive  perverts  the  statutory  text,  undermines legislative\n\nintent, and  defenestrates common sense.

(Oakmont), alleging that BCO is a food additive of\n\nquestionable safety.

(1988), we\n                                                      \n\naffirm the district court's dismissal  of the government's in rem\n                                                                 \n\ncomplaint.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          On October  11, 1988, the  United States Food  and Drug\n\nAdministration  (FDA)  seized 200  bottles  of encapsulated  BCO,\n\npacked in  twenty-nine  cartons, and  brought  an in  rem  action\n                                                         \n\ncontending  that, under  21 U.S.C.    342(a)(2)(C),  the capsules\n\nshould be condemned as \"adulterated\" food  because they contain a\n\n\"food additive,\" the BCO, that Oakmont had not proven to be safe.\n\n          At   the  ensuing  bench   trial,  certain  facts  were\n\nuncontradicted.   BCO is  a  liquid obtained  by squeezing  black\n\ncurrant berry  seeds.   It is  composed of  polyunsaturated fatty\n\nacids.   In  its pure  liquid  form, it  can be  ingested by  the\n\nspoonful  as a dietary supplement.   However, Oakmont markets BCO\n\nin  capsules which  are  to be  swallowed  whole.   The  capsules\n\ncontain pure BCO   nothing more.   They are made from gelatin and\n\nglycerin (or  an equivalent plasticizer) and  have no independent\n\nnutritional  value.  Rather, a capsule serves a dual purpose as a\n\n                                2\n\ncontainer  (enabling consumers to ingest predetermined quantities\n\nof  BCO in solid form) and as  a prophylactic (protecting the BCO\n\nfrom rancidity).\n\n          On these and other  facts, the district court dismissed\n\nthe  government's complaint  and  ordered the  capsules released.\n\nSee United States v. 29 Cartons,  Etc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1882823\"><a href=\"/opinion/1882823/united-states-v-29-cartons-more-or-less/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 142 (D.\n                                      \n\nMass. 1992).  The court reasoned that when, as in  this case, BCO\n\ncomprises the only active ingredient within a gelatin capsule, it\n\ncan  properly  be classified  as  a \"food,\"  but  not as  a \"food\n\nadditive.\"   See id.  at 141-42.   Accordingly, the FDA  erred in\n                    \n\nseizing the bottles on the  ground that they \"allegedly contain[]\n\nan unsafe food additive.\"  Id. at 142.\n                              \n\n          When the  FDA appealed,  the district court  stayed its\n\nrelease order.\n\nII.  THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE\n\n          To put  this case  into workable perspective,  we first\n\nreview the relevant statutory provisions.  The Act defines \"food\"\n\nas:\n\n          (1) articles  used for food or  drink for man\n          or other  animals, (2)  chewing gum,  and (3)\n          articles  used  for  components  of  any such\n          article.\n\n21 U.S.C.   321(f).   The FDA concedes that pure BCO  (sold, say,\n\nas  a bottled  liquid)  falls within  section  321(f)(1) and  is,\n\ntherefore, \"food.\"  Substances  classified as \"food\" are presumed\n\nsafe.  Thus, the FDA can prevent sale of bottled BCO or any other\n\n\"food\" only if it proves by a preponderance of the  evidence that\n\nthe food is \"injurious to health.\"   21 U.S.C.   342(a)(1);  see,\n                                                                \n\n                                3\n\ne.g.,  United States v.

Although   the  FDA  suspects  that  BCO  may  be\n\nunhealthful, it is unable  at the present time to  translate this\n\nsuspicion into legally competent proof.\n\n          In  addition to regulating the sale of food per se, the\n                                                            \n\nAct contains  provisions anent food additives.   These provisions\n\nare  designed to  protect consumers  against the  introduction of\n\nuntested  and  potentially  unsafe  substances, such  as  flavor,\n\ntexture, or preservative agents, into food.  A gloss was added to\n\nthe treatment of food additives in 1958.  See Pub. L. No. 85-929,\n                                             \n\n72 Stat.  1784  (1958)  (codified in  scattered  sections  of  21\n\nU.S.C.).   Unlike section  342(a)(1), which places  the burden of\n\nproving injuriousness  upon the  government in respect  to foods,\n\nthe  food   additives  amendment   allocates  the   burden  quite\n\ndifferently:  the FDA can prevent the sale of products containing\n\na food additive  unless and  until the processor  shows that  the\n\nsubstance, when added  to food, is  generally recognized as  safe\n\n(in the  vernacular, \"GRAS\").  See S.  Rep. No. 2422, 85th Cong.,\n                                  \n\n2d  Sess. (1958),  reprinted in  1958 U.S.C.C.A.N.  5300, 5301-02\n                               \n\n(explaining  the  processor's burden  \"of  proving  that a  newly\n\ndiscovered substance  which . . . [is] add[ed] to the food we eat\n\nis  safe\").  Thus, in contrast to  the Act's treatment of \"food,\"\n\nany  substance  that  meets  the  Act's  definition  of  a  \"food\n\nadditive\"  is presumed to be \"unsafe\" under 21 U.S.C.   348 until\n\n                                4\n\nthe  FDA,  or more  particularly,  the Commissioner  of  Food and\n\nDrugs,  has  promulgated  a  regulation   prescribing  conditions\n\nassuring safe  use.   See  21  U.S.C.    348(a)(2); 21  C.F.R.   \n                         \n\n5.10(a)(1) (1992).\n\n          The 1958 amendment defines a food additive in pertinent\n\npart as:\n\n          any  substance  the  intended  use  of  which\n          results  or  may  reasonably be  expected  to\n          result,  directly  or   indirectly,  in   its\n          becoming a component  or otherwise  affecting\n          the  characteristics  of any  food (including\n          any substance intended for use  in producing,\n          manufacturing,      packing,      processing,\n          preparing, treating, packaging, transporting,\n          or holding food; and including any  source of\n          radiation intended for any such use), if such\n          substance is not generally  recognized, among\n          experts qualified by scientific  training and\n          experience  to evaluate its safety, as having\n          been  adequately   shown  through  scientific\n          procedures  .  .  .  to  be  safe  under  the\n          conditions of its intended use . . . .\n\n21  U.S.C.    321(s).   To be  labeled a  food additive,  then, a\n\nsubstance must (1) be intended, or reasonably expected, to become\n\na component of food or to otherwise affect the characteristics of\n\nfood, and (2) not be GRAS.\n\n          The Act  thus creates  a distinction between  foods and\n\nfood additives which  has meaningful  consequences for  purveyors\n\nand for the  public.  The distinction also  significantly affects\n\nthe ease with which the FDA may regulate a substance's sale.\n\nIII.  THE ISSUE\n\n          This appeal revolves around the question of whether the\n\nFDA or Oakmont must carry out the research necessary to show that\n\nBCO is, or is not, GRAS.  The issue reduces to whether  pure BCO,\n\n                                5\n\nwhen sold in  encapsulated form,  must be regulated  as a  \"food\"\n\nwithin  the meaning  of section  321(f) or  as a  \"food additive\"\n\nwithin the meaning of section 321(s).\n\n          The  meat of  the parties'  disagreement lies  in their\n\ndiffering interpretations of that portion of the Act which states\n\nthat  a substance  can  be a  food additive  if its  intended use\n\nresults,  or  may  be expected  to  result,  \"in  its becoming  a\n\ncomponent  or  otherwise  affecting the  characteristics  of  any\n\nfood.\"  21  U.S.C.   321(s).1  The FDA  reads the quoted language\n\nas  creating  two  independent  and disjunctive  standards:    to\n\nsatisfy  the  first prong  of  the  food additive  definition,  a\n\nsubstance  must either  (1)  be  a  component  of  food,  or  (2)\n\notherwise  affect  the characteristics  of  food.   Because  each\n\nconstituent part or element of a food (that is, each \"component\")\n\nnecessarily affects the food's characteristics, the FDA considers\n\nevery component, at least potentially, see  infra note 3, to be a\n                                                 \n\nfood  additive.2  Drawing on this interpretation, the FDA asserts\n\nthat  the  seized  capsules  are  composed  of  three  consumable\n\ncomponents   BCO,  gelatin, and glycerin    and that,  therefore,\n\neach  of   these  three  ingredients  is   subject  to  potential\n\n                    \n\n     1The  district court  bifurcated the  trial and,  during the\ninitial phase, determined only  that BCO does not meet  the first\nprong  of the  bipartite  food additive  definition.   Thus,  the\ndistrict court had no  occasion to reach the second  prong, viz.,\n                                                                \nwhether BCO is GRAS.  Hence, that issue is not before us.\n\n     2In  the  FDA's view,  the  second  of the  two  independent\nstandards  confers potential food  additive status  on substances\nthat,  while  they  are not  constituent  parts  of  a food,  may\nnevertheless have deleterious effects on food.  One example might\nbe chemicals used in packaging food.\n\n                                6\n\nregulation as a food additive.3\n\n          As  Oakmont  parses  the  statute, it  creates  only  a\n\nsingle, unitary food additive standard.  The phrase \"or otherwise\n\naffecting  the  characteristics  of  any  food\"  signals  that  a\n\ncomponent is potentially a  food additive only if it  affects the\n\ncharacteristics of  some food to  which it is added.   Unlike the\n\nFDA's  interpretation,  Oakmont's   interpretation  attaches   no\n\nsignificance to a substance's  mere presence as a component  of a\n\nwhole.   It focuses instead on the substance's affirmative use in\n\na way that affects food.\n\n          Applying its interpretation of the statute to the facts\n\nat  bar, Oakmont  argued below,  as  it does  here, that  the BCO\n\ncontained  in the  seized capsules  is itself  a food  and  not a\n\ncomponent  of some other  food, that it is  intended so to serve,\n\nand  that  its  sale in  a  convenient  carrier  medium does  not\n\ntransmogrify it  into a food additive.   In holding that  food is\n\ndefined \"by  its 'use[] for  food,'\" 29 Cartons, 792  F. Supp. at\n                                               \n\n141  (quoting 21  U.S.C.    321(f)), whereas  a food  additive is\n\ndefined by its effect on another substance, see id., the district\n                                                   \n\ncourt substantially adopted Oakmont's reading  of the law and its\n\nfocus on a substance's intended function.\n\n          In specific terms, then,  we must determine whether, as\n\nthe FDA would have it, any element of any substance that has more\n                                         \n\n                    \n\n     3We use the adjectival modifier \"potential\"  because gelatin\nand glycerin are concededly GRAS.  Hence, these components cannot\nbe classified as  food additives because neither can  fulfill the\ndefinition's second prong.\n\n                                7\n\nthan  one component may be  branded a food  additive, or, rather,\n\nwhether,  as Oakmont  urges and  the court  below believed,  such\n\ntreatment  should be reserved for elements  which, when so added,\n\neffect  a change  (or, at  least, could be  expected to  effect a\n\nchange) in some other active ingredient.\n\nIV.  FOOD FOR THOUGHT\n\n          The  Seventh  Circuit  has  recently  grappled  with  a\n\nfactually  similar case presenting  this very issue.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Two Plastic Drums, Etc.,      F.2d     (7th Cir. 1993)\n                                  \n\n[No. 92-1172].   Employing a perspicacious analysis  of the Act's\n\ntext and legislative history, the court rejected the FDA's notion\n\nthat  all   components  of  a  substance   are  necessarily  food\n         \n\nadditives.   The court observed  that the \"'or otherwise'\" phrase\n\ncontained in the statutory definition of a  food additive targets\n\nonly  those components  that  \"have  the  purpose  or  effect  of\n\naltering a food's  characteristics.\"  Id. at     [slip  op. at 6-\n                                         \n\n7].    The  subsequent  enumeration  of  sample  food  additives,\n\ndescribing  each substance by its \"function or by [its] effect on\n\nfood,\" makes it clear that an additive must stimulate some change\n\nin  a food to  which it is  added.  Id.  at     [slip  op. at 6].\n                                       \n\nTurning  to the legislative history, the  court observed that the\n\nFDA's broad definition of  a food additive, which would  apply to\n\nall components, even a substance which comprises  the only active\n\ningredient   of  the   whole,  subverts   congressional  purpose.\n\nBlurring the distinction between food additives  and food in this\n\nway would  permit  the  agency  to  tilt  a  delicately  balanced\n\n                                8\n\nstatutory  scheme  that  allocates   the  burden  of  proving  an\n\nadditive's safety to  the processors while leaving  the burden of\n\nestablishing a food's safety with the  FDA.  See id. at     [slip\n                                                    \n\nop. at 8-9].\n\n          The Seventh Circuit also recognized the incongruity  of\n\ncategorizing  a food's  single active  component as  an additive.\n\nBecause   \"that    single   component   does   not   affect   the\n\ncharacteristics  of the food in question   rather, it constitutes\n\nthe food,\"  id. at      [slip op. at 7],  it has no  place within\n               \n\n\"the common  understanding of an additive, defined  by Webster as\n\n'a  substance  added  to another  .  .  .  to  impart or  improve\n\ndesirable properties  or suppress undesirable  properties.'\"  Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat    n.3 [slip op. at 7 n.3] (citation omitted).  Thus, in order\n\nto  qualify as a  food additive, a  component must be  added to a\n\nfood in order  to change that food's properties.   See id. at    \n                                                          \n\n[slip op. at 7-8].  On that basis, pure BCO, in  capsule form, is\n\nnot a food additive.  See id. at     [slip op. at 11]. \n                             \n\n          Judges should hesitate to write lengthy opinions merely\n\nfor the sake  of committing their own prose to  posterity.  Given\n\nthe existence  of  a  cogent,  well-reasoned,  eminently  correct\n\nopinion closely on  point, we  embrace it.   We will,  therefore,\n\naffirm  the   judgment  below   for  substantially   the  reasons\n\nelucidated in  Two  Plastic Drums.   We  pause, nevertheless,  to\n                                 \n\nessay a few additional observations.\n\n          First:    We are  reluctant  to  believe that  Congress\n          First:\n               \n\ntraffics in absurdities.   Since  it defies common  sense to  say\n\n                                9\n\nthat a  substance  can be  a  \"food additive\"  when  there is  no\n\n(other)  food  to which  it is  added,  we think  that  the FDA's\n\nreading of the Act is nonsensical, and, hence, must be incorrect.\n\nMoreover,  classifying BCO as a  \"component\" merely because it is\n\ncombined with  two totally inert  substances serving collectively\n\nas a  carrier medium would  itself create a bizarre  paradox:  as\n\nthe Seventh  Circuit noted, \"to hold  that BCO is  a component of\n\nthe dietary supplement  would be to find that BCO  is a component\n\nof itself.\"  Two Plastic Drums,     F.2d at     [slip op. at 5].\n                              \n\n          Second:    In  the  FDA's   estimation,  a  processor's\n          Second:\n                \n\n\"subjective  intent\"  that only  one  of  a product's  components\n\nconstitutes  the food is irrelevant because  \"it is the objective\n                                                                 \n\nintended use, i.e., the intent to combine two or more components,\n                  \n\nthat  counts.\"   Appellant's  Brief at  11.   But,  this harangue\n\nmisses  the mark.  We  fully agree that  a processor's subjective\n\ndetermination of what constitutes a food  is not determinative in\n\ncases of this stripe     but neither is the naked  fact that more\n\nthan one component  has been  combined.  In  the final  analysis,\n\nwhat  counts is the use of an  ingredient for its effect on food.\n\nHere, from an objective standpoint, BCO is not being used for its\n\neffect on gelatin  and glycerine.   Thus, contrary  to the  FDA's\n\nloudly expressed fears, eschewing  its rendition of the statutory\n\ntext will not supplant objectivity with subjectivity.4\n\n                    \n\n     4Moreover, if the  FDA worries that processors  may muck the\nstatutory  classifications with convenient recitals of subjective\nintent,  we question the agency's  espousal of a  rule that would\n\"arbitrarily classify a substance as either food or food additive\nby how it  is marketed rather than by  the nature and use  of the\n\n                                10\n\n          Third:    The  FDA  also maintains  that  because  \"the\n          Third:\n               \n\ningredients  of  multi-ingredient  food products,  such  as  cake\n\nmixes,\" indisputably fall  within the  food additive  definition,\n\nthe  statute could  not possibly  contain a  \"requirement  that a\n\nsubstance must be  added to a preexisting food, which  it must be\n                                         \n\nshown actually to affect.\"  Appellant's Brief at 9.  We disagree.\n\nCake mixes are foods composed of many interacting food additives,\n\neach with  its particular effect on  the whole.5  Absent  any one\n\ningredient, the  concoction remains a  cake mix, albeit  one that\n\nmay be  short on sweetness or  lumpy in texture.   In that sense,\n\ncake mixes and products of that ilk are a far cry from a  dietary\n\nsupplement  composed  of  a   single  active  ingredient.    What\n\ndifferentiates  this case is that, if the  BCO is removed, one is\n\nleft with nothing but an empty capsule.\n\n          Fourth:   We  think it  advisable to mention  the FDA's\n          Fourth:\n                \n\ninsistence, citing Chevron U.
