Background\n\n             Seide is a native and citizen of Haiti.           On August 25,\n\n2001, he attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to use a United States\n\npassport that originally had been issued to another person to enter\n\nthe United States.       Prior to seeking entry into the United States,\n\nSeide lived in Port-au-Prince, Haiti with his wife, whom he married\n\nin January 2001 and who still lives in Port-au-Prince.               Seide was\n\nborn and grew up in Cavaillon, Haiti with his parents, two sisters,\n\nand a brother.       By August 2001, his parents and one sister lived in\n\nSt. Martin and his brother lived in the Dominican Republic.2\n\n             In September 2001, the United States Immigration and\n\nNaturalization       Service     (\"INS\")   initiated     removal    proceedings\n\nagainst Seide.3      At his removal hearing before an Immigration Judge\n\n\n     1\n      The CAT's full name is the United Nations Convention Against\nTorture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\nPunishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85. Article 3 of the CAT\nwas implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform\nand Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112\nStat. 2681, 2681-822 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231).\n     2\n         Seide's other sister lived in the United States.\n     3\n     The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, §\n471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. §\n\n                                        -2-\n\f(\"IJ\"), Seide conceded removability but applied for relief in the\n\nform of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT.\n\n          During the hearing, Seide testified that he came to the\n\nUnited States to escape adverse treatment that he faced as a result\n\nof his political activities.4   He claimed that he became involved\n\nin politics in Haiti in 1999 when he joined Rassemblement des\n\nCitoyens Patriotes (\"RCP\"), an organization devoted to pursuing\n\nsocial and political reform in Haiti.   He also said that he was a\n\nmember of Organisation des Militants Kavayone (\"ODMK\"), a group\n\nthat sought to bring about reform in Cavaillon.    Seide routinely\n\ntraveled from his home in Port-au-Prince to Cavaillon.\n\n          Seide maintained that due to his reformist activities, he\n\nbegan to experience adverse treatment in May 2000.    He recounted\n\nthat on May 22, 2000, he was in the headquarters of RCP when the\n\nbuilding was shot at and invaded by supporters of the Lavalas\n\nParty, Haiti's ruling political party.     Seide averred that the\n\nintruders killed one member of RCP, wounded fifteen to twenty\n\nothers, and stole documents that contained names and addresses of\n\nRCP members.\n\n\n\n\n291(a)), abolished the INS as an independent agency and transferred\nmany of its duties to a bureau of the Department of Homeland\nSecurity.\n     4\n      The following account is derived from Seide's removal hearing\ntestimony and from his affidavit in support of his application for\nrelief from removal.\n\n                                -3-\n\f          Seide further testified that on July 14, 2000, four men\n\nwearing shirts bearing the logo of the Lavalas Party broke into his\n\nhome while he was out, asked his servant for him by name, and\n\nstole, among other things, his passport.    The intruders allegedly\n\npromised to return when he was in residence.      Approximately two\n\nweeks later, Seide obtained a replacement passport.       After the\n\nbreak-in, Seide vacated his home and, for several months, stayed\n\nwith friends and family in various locations within Port-au-Prince.\n\nThen, in January 2001, he married and reestablished a permanent\n\nhome with his wife in Port-au-Prince.   Throughout this time, Seide\n\ncontinued to travel between and conduct political activities in\n\nPort-au-Prince and Cavaillon.\n\n          Next, Seide claimed that on November 25, 2000, he was\n\nattending mass in a church near Cavaillon with members of ODMK when\n\na group of men brandishing firearms entered the church and ordered\n\neveryone inside to the ground.   The mayor of Cavaillon, a member of\n\nthe Lavalas Party, was allegedly among the intruders. Seide stated\n\nthat he was physically attacked (though he did not require medical\n\ntreatment) and ordered to cease his political activities.\n\n          Seide further insisted that two months later, in January\n\n2001, the coordinator of ODMK was arrested and held in custody for\n\na little over two weeks without being formally charged of a crime.\n\nThe coordinator allegedly died soon after his release due to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\finjuries he sustained while in custody.            Seide acknowledged that\n\nwhile living in Haiti, he was never similarly detained.\n\n          Seide also recounted that on August 4, 2001, while\n\ndriving a relative's car (a car he had previously driven on only a\n\nfew occasions), he was followed and shot at by individuals in\n\nanother car.   He asserted that he managed to escape on foot after\n\nlosing control of the car. Seide could not identify his attackers.\n\nMoreover, although he indicated in his written affidavit that, as\n\nhe ran away, his attackers yelled political epithets at him, he did\n\nnot include this detail in his testimony before the IJ.\n\n          After considering all of the above, the IJ concluded that\n\nSeide had failed to establish an entitlement to the relief that he\n\nsought.   She refused his request for asylum, finding that he did\n\nnot have a well-founded fear of future persecution in Haiti on\n\naccount of his political beliefs and that he had not established\n\nthat his departure from Haiti was caused by any prior politically-\n\nmotivated incidents.   As to the August 2001 attack, the IJ found it\n\nsignificant that Seide was driving a borrowed car, could not\n\nidentify his attackers, and did not testify that his attackers\n\nyelled political epithets at him.           She concluded that there was\n\ninsufficient   evidence   that   he   was    the   intended   target   of   a\n\npolitically-motivated attack and that, given the circumstances, he\n\ncould not reasonably have viewed himself as the intended target of\n\nsuch an attack.   Further, she noted that the most recent of the\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fother incidents occurred nine months before he left Haiti.5   From\n\nthis, she reasoned that Seide did not have a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution and that his attempt to enter the United States\n\nwas not \"on account of threats . . . or mistreatment that he\n\nreceived [due to] his political activities\"; it was \"a matter of\n\nchoice and not necessity.\"\n\n          The IJ then denied Seide's request for withholding of\n\nremoval because she found that he had \"failed to establish a clear\n\nprobability of persecution\" on account of his political beliefs if\n\nhe were returned to Haiti.   Finally, she determined that Seide had\n\nnot shown that \"the authorities would . . . subject him to torture\"\n\nif he were to return to Haiti, and thus, she denied his request for\n\nrelief under the CAT.\n\n          Seide appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA.   After the\n\nBIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling, Seide filed this timely\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The IJ also found it significant that Seide applied for and\nreceived a replacement passport immediately after the home\ninvasion; at all relevant times, he traveled between and engaged in\npolitical activities in Port-au-Prince and Cavaillon; from January\nto August 2001, he lived without incident with his wife in a\npermanent home in Port-au-Prince; and he used another person's\npassport to try to enter the United States rather than using his\nown passport to legally gain access to St. Martin (where his\nparents and one sister lived) or the Dominican Republic (where his\nbrother lived).\n\n                                -6-\n\f                           II.   Discussion\n\n            We uphold decisions of the BIA if they are \"supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"    INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).     This standard applies\n\nto claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the\n\nCAT.   Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).    \"We\n\nwill reverse only if the petitioner's evidence would compel a\n\nreasonable factfinder to conclude that relief was warranted.\"    Id.\n\n            Ordinarily, we review decisions of the BIA, and not those\n\nof an IJ.    See Njenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 338 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   But, if, as in this case, the BIA has adopted the opinion\n\nof an IJ, then we must look to that decision instead and \"treat the\n\nfindings and conclusion of the IJ as the [BIA's] own opinion.\"\n\nHerbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nA.          Asylum\n\n            An asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that he\n\n\"is unable or unwilling to return to [his country of nationality]\n\n. . . because of [past] persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\n[future] persecution on account of . . . political opinion.\"       8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).      A showing of\n\npast persecution entitles the applicant to a rebuttable presumption\n\nof a well-founded fear of future persecution.      See Mukamusoni v.\n\nAshcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004).    To carry his burden,\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fSeide had to show that he left Haiti for the United States because\n\nhe faced past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution as a result of his political beliefs.6   See id.   Still,\n\nif he demonstrated only past persecution and the government was\n\nable to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution, he would not have been entitled to asylum.    See id.\n\n          The IJ found that Seide was ineligible for asylum because\n\nhe established only past persecution and the government succeeded\n\nin rebutting the presumption of a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution, and he did not prove that his departure from Haiti was\n\ncaused by the past persecution.      Because the evidence does not\n\n\"compel\" that we reach a conclusion different from that of the IJ,\n\nwe affirm.   See Settenda, 377 F.3d at 93.\n\n          Were it clear that Seide was the intended target of the\n\nAugust 2001 automobile attack and that he was targeted because of\n\nhis political beliefs, this might be a more compelling case.    But,\n\nwe cannot say that the evidence necessitated the conclusion that\n\nSeide was, or that he reasonably could have viewed himself as, the\n\nintended target of a politically-motivated attack in August 2001,\n\ngiven that he could not identify his attackers, did not testify\n\n\n\n     6\n      To show past persecution, Seide had to provide \"conclusive\nevidence\" that he was targeted because of his political opinions.\nAli v. Gonzales, 401 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2005). And, to show a\nwell-founded fear of future persecution, he had to establish that\nhis \"fear [was] both genuine and objectively reasonable.\" Aguilar-\nSolis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                               -8-\n\fthat his attackers yelled political epithets at him, and at the\n\ntime of the attack, was driving a borrowed vehicle.   Moreover, the\n\nNovember 2000 incident, the most recent of the other incidents,\n\noccurred nine months before Seide left Haiti.    And, during that\n\nperiod, Seide lived openly with his wife in Port-au-Prince and\n\ncontinued to travel between and engage in political activities in\n\nPort-au-Prince and Cavaillon.   Thus, there is sufficient evidence\n\nto support the IJ's finding that Seide was not the intended target\n\nof a politically-motivated attack in August 2001; the incidents of\n\nMay, July, and November 2000 cannot fairly be viewed as the cause\n\nof his August 2001 departure; and, despite those incidents, he did\n\nnot have a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of\n\nhis political beliefs in August 2001.7\n\nB.        Withholding of Removal\n\n          Because Seide failed to demonstrate his eligibility for\n\nasylum, he is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal.\n\n\n     7\n      Although we view the delay between the incidents in 2000 and\nSeide’s departure in August 2001 as significant to the asylum\ndetermination, our decision is informed by a number of other\nfactors as well. In particular, we find it noteworthy that Seide's\nwife currently lives peacefully in Port-au-Prince; in all of\nSeide's allegedly violent encounters with members of the Lavalas\nParty, he was never injured to the point where he required medical\nattention; and he used another person's passport to try to enter\nthe United States rather using his own passport to legally gain\naccess to St. Martin or the Dominican Republic (which supports the\nIJ's conclusion that his seeking to enter the United States was \"a\nmatter of choice and not necessity\"). Moreover, if Seide truly\nfeared that supporters of the Lavalas Party were out to harm him\nafter the July 2000 home invasion, he probably would not have\nimmediately applied to the authorities for a replacement passport.\n\n                                -9-\n\fSee Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"Because the\n\nstandard for withholding . . . is more stringent than that for\n\nasylum, a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard fails,\n\na fortiori, to satisfy the former.\" (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).      For   this   reason,   the   denial    of   his   request   for\n\nwithholding of removal is affirmed.\n\nC.         Convention Against Torture\n\n           An applicant seeking relief under the CAT must \"establish\n\nthat it is more likely than not that he . . . would be tortured if\n\nremoved   to   the    proposed   country     of   removal.\"       8   C.F.R.   §\n\n208.16(c)(2).    For an act to constitute torture, it must be, inter\n\nalia, inflicted \"by or at the instigation of or with the consent or\n\nacquiescence of a public official.\"           Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d\n\n392, 398 (1st Cir. 2004); see 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1).\n\n           There is sufficient support for the IJ's conclusion that\n\nSeide failed to establish that \"it is more likely than not\" that he\n\nwill be tortured if returned to Haiti.                As we have said, the\n\nevidence indicates that from January to August 2001, Seide lived\n\nopenly in Port-au-Prince and traveled between and engaged in\n\npolitical activities in Port-au-Prince and Cavaillon.                  It also\n\nsupports the IJ's finding that, during this time, Seide was not\n\nspecifically targeted by any individuals, much less individuals\n\nassociated with the government.        The denial of Seide's request for\n\nrelief under the CAT is affirmed.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -11-\n\f",

He recounted\n\nthat on May 22, 2000, he was in the headquarters of RCP when the\n\nbuilding was shot at and invaded by supporters of the Lavalas\n\nParty, Haiti's ruling political party.     Seide averred that the\n\nintruders killed one member of RCP, wounded fifteen to twenty\n\nothers, and stole documents that contained names and addresses of\n\nRCP members.\n\n\n\n\n291(a)), abolished the INS as an independent agency and transferred\nmany of its duties to a bureau of the Department of Homeland\nSecurity.\n     4\n      The following account is derived from Seide's removal hearing\ntestimony and from his affidavit in support of his application for\nrelief from removal.\n\n                                -3-\n\f          Seide further testified that on July 14, 2000, four men\n\nwearing shirts bearing the logo of the Lavalas Party broke into his\n\nhome while he was out, asked his servant for him by name, and\n\nstole, among other things, his passport.    The intruders allegedly\n\npromised to return when he was in residence.      Approximately two\n\nweeks later, Seide obtained a replacement passport.       After the\n\nbreak-in, Seide vacated his home and, for several months, stayed\n\nwith friends and family in various locations within Port-au-Prince.\n\nThen, in January 2001, he married and reestablished a permanent\n\nhome with his wife in Port-au-Prince.   Throughout this time, Seide\n\ncontinued to travel between and conduct political activities in\n\nPort-au-Prince and Cavaillon.\n\n          Next, Seide claimed that on November 25, 2000, he was\n\nattending mass in a church near Cavaillon with members of ODMK when\n\na group of men brandishing firearms entered the church and ordered\n\neveryone inside to the ground.   The mayor of Cavaillon, a member of\n\nthe Lavalas Party, was allegedly among the intruders. Seide stated\n\nthat he was physically attacked (though he did not require medical\n\ntreatment) and ordered to cease his political activities.\n\n          Seide further insisted that two months later, in January\n\n2001, the coordinator of ODMK was arrested and held in custody for\n\na little over two weeks without being formally charged of a crime.\n\nThe coordinator allegedly died soon after his release due to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\finjuries he sustained while in custody.            Seide acknowledged that\n\nwhile living in Haiti, he was never similarly detained.\n\n          Seide also recounted that on August 4, 2001, while\n\ndriving a relative's car (a car he had previously driven on only a\n\nfew occasions), he was followed and shot at by individuals in\n\nanother car.   He asserted that he managed to escape on foot after\n\nlosing control of the car. Seide could not identify his attackers.\n\nMoreover, although he indicated in his written affidavit that, as\n\nhe ran away, his attackers yelled political epithets at him, he did\n\nnot include this detail in his testimony before the IJ.\n\n          After considering all of the above, the IJ concluded that\n\nSeide had failed to establish an entitlement to the relief that he\n\nsought.   She refused his request for asylum, finding that he did\n\nnot have a well-founded fear of future persecution in Haiti on\n\naccount of his political beliefs and that he had not established\n\nthat his departure from Haiti was caused by any prior politically-\n\nmotivated incidents.   As to the August 2001 attack, the IJ found it\n\nsignificant that Seide was driving a borrowed car, could not\n\nidentify his attackers, and did not testify that his attackers\n\nyelled political epithets at him.           She concluded that there was\n\ninsufficient   evidence   that   he   was    the   intended   target   of   a\n\npolitically-motivated attack and that, given the circumstances, he\n\ncould not reasonably have viewed himself as the intended target of\n\nsuch an attack.   Further, she noted that the most recent of the\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fother incidents occurred nine months before he left Haiti.5   From\n\nthis, she reasoned that Seide did not have a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution and that his attempt to enter the United States\n\nwas not \"on account of threats . . . or mistreatment that he\n\nreceived [due to] his political activities\"; it was \"a matter of\n\nchoice and not necessity.\"\n\n          The IJ then denied Seide's request for withholding of\n\nremoval because she found that he had \"failed to establish a clear\n\nprobability of persecution\" on account of his political beliefs if\n\nhe were returned to Haiti.   Finally, she determined that Seide had\n\nnot shown that \"the authorities would . . . subject him to torture\"\n\nif he were to return to Haiti, and thus, she denied his request for\n\nrelief under the CAT.\n\n          Seide appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA.   After the\n\nBIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling, Seide filed this timely\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The IJ also found it significant that Seide applied for and\nreceived a replacement passport immediately after the home\ninvasion; at all relevant times, he traveled between and engaged in\npolitical activities in Port-au-Prince and Cavaillon; from January\nto August 2001, he lived without incident with his wife in a\npermanent home in Port-au-Prince; and he used another person's\npassport to try to enter the United States rather than using his\nown passport to legally gain access to St. Martin (where his\nparents and one sister lived) or the Dominican Republic (where his\nbrother lived).\n\n                                -6-\n\f                           II.

Asylum\n\n            An asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that he\n\n\"is unable or unwilling to return to [his country of nationality]\n\n. . . because of [past] persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\n[future] persecution on account of . . . political opinion.\"       8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).      A showing of\n\npast persecution entitles the applicant to a rebuttable presumption\n\nof a well-founded fear of future persecution.      See Mukamusoni v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201357\"><a href=\"/opinion/201357/mukamusoni-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 119 (1st Cir. 2004).    To carry his burden,\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fSeide had to show that he left Haiti for the United States because\n\nhe faced past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution as a result of his political beliefs.6   See id.   Still,\n\nif he demonstrated only past persecution and the government was\n\nable to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution, he would not have been entitled to asylum.    See id.\n\n          The IJ found that Seide was ineligible for asylum because\n\nhe established only past persecution and the government succeeded\n\nin rebutting the presumption of a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution, and he did not prove that his departure from Haiti was\n\ncaused by the past persecution.      Because the evidence does not\n\n\"compel\" that we reach a conclusion different from that of the IJ,\n\nwe affirm.   See Settenda, 377 F.3d at 93.\n\n          Were it clear that Seide was the intended target of the\n\nAugust 2001 automobile attack and that he was targeted because of\n\nhis political beliefs, this might be a more compelling case.    But,\n\nwe cannot say that the evidence necessitated the conclusion that\n\nSeide was, or that he reasonably could have viewed himself as, the\n\nintended target of a politically-motivated attack in August 2001,\n\ngiven that he could not identify his attackers, did not testify\n\n\n\n     6\n      To show past persecution, Seide had to provide \"conclusive\nevidence\" that he was targeted because of his political opinions.\nAli v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201489\"><a href=\"/opinion/201489/ali-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 2005). And, to show a\nwell-founded fear of future persecution, he had to establish that\nhis \"fear [was] both genuine and objectively reasonable.\" Aguilar-\nSolis v.

Moreover, the\n\nNovember 2000 incident, the most recent of the other incidents,\n\noccurred nine months before Seide left Haiti.    And, during that\n\nperiod, Seide lived openly with his wife in Port-au-Prince and\n\ncontinued to travel between and engage in political activities in\n\nPort-au-Prince and Cavaillon.   Thus, there is sufficient evidence\n\nto support the IJ's finding that Seide was not the intended target\n\nof a politically-motivated attack in August 2001; the incidents of\n\nMay, July, and November 2000 cannot fairly be viewed as the cause\n\nof his August 2001 departure; and, despite those incidents, he did\n\nnot have a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of\n\nhis political beliefs in August 2001.7\n\nB.        Withholding of Removal\n\n          Because Seide failed to demonstrate his eligibility for\n\nasylum, he is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal.\n\n\n     7\n      Although we view the delay between the incidents in 2000 and\nSeide’s departure in August 2001 as significant to the asylum\ndetermination, our decision is informed by a number of other\nfactors as well. In particular, we find it noteworthy that Seide's\nwife currently lives peacefully in Port-au-Prince; in all of\nSeide's allegedly violent encounters with members of the Lavalas\nParty, he was never injured to the point where he required medical\nattention; and he used another person's passport to try to enter\nthe United States rather using his own passport to legally gain\naccess to St. Martin or the Dominican Republic (which supports the\nIJ's conclusion that his seeking to enter the United States was \"a\nmatter of choice and not necessity\"). Moreover, if Seide truly\nfeared that supporters of the Lavalas Party were out to harm him\nafter the July 2000 home invasion, he probably would not have\nimmediately applied to the authorities for a replacement passport.\n\n                                -9-\n\fSee Mediouni v.

For   this   reason,   the   denial    of   his   request   for\n\nwithholding of removal is affirmed.\n\nC.         Convention Against Torture\n\n           An applicant seeking relief under the CAT must \"establish\n\nthat it is more likely than not that he . . . would be tortured if\n\nremoved   to   the    proposed   country     of   removal.\"       8   C.F.R.   §\n\n208.16(c)(2).    For an act to constitute torture, it must be, inter\n\nalia, inflicted \"by or at the instigation of or with the consent or\n\nacquiescence of a public official.\"           Elien v.

As we have said, the\n\nevidence indicates that from January to August 2001, Seide lived\n\nopenly in Port-au-Prince and traveled between and engaged in\n\npolitical activities in Port-au-Prince and Cavaillon.                  It also\n\nsupports the IJ's finding that, during this time, Seide was not\n\nspecifically targeted by any individuals, much less individuals\n\nassociated with the government.        The denial of Seide's request for\n\nrelief under the CAT is affirmed.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -11-\n\f</pre>",
