This  case consists\n                                      \n\nof  cross  appeals  from a  judgment  of  the  United States\n\nDistrict Court  for the  District of  Massachusetts, Rya  W.\n\nZobel, Judge.   The Government appeals both the  decision of\n            \n\nthe  court  to  entertain  a  collateral  challenge  to  the\n\nconstitutionality  of a prior  conviction at  sentencing and\n\nthe  decision of  the court  that the  prior conviction  was\n\nconstitutionally  invalid.   The  defendant, Edward  Isaacs,\n\nappeals his conviction  on the basis that the district court\n\nimproperly allowed  into evidence an indictment  against his\n\nfather and cousins and  improperly allowed him to be  cross-\n\nexamined concerning his knowledge of  his relatives' alleged\n\nloansharking  enterprise.  For the reasons below, we reverse\n\nthe  district court's  decision  that it  had  the power  to\n\nreview the constitutionality of Isaacs' prior conviction and\n\naffirm  its decision  to admit  the  indictment against  his\n\nfather into evidence and to allow him to be questioned about\n\nthe activities of his relatives.\n\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                   \n\n          Isaacs  was convicted of  one count  of conspiracy\n\nand  one  count of  using extortionate  means to  attempt to\n\ncollect a loan, in  violation of 18  U.S.C.    2 and  894(a)\n\n(1988).   According  to  the  Government,  racketeering  and\n\nloansharking was something of a family business.  Isaacs got\n\ninvolved  in the \"business\"  after his father,  Leonard, was\n\n                             2\n\nindicted, placed  under house arrest,  and developed  health\n\nproblems.  Isaacs' conviction is  based on his dealings with\n\none  of his  father's alleged  loansharking  victims, Robert\n\nAyala.  Ayala  had borrowed $2,500 from  Leonard in November\n\nof 1990 and had been making weekly interest payments of $100\n\n(for an interest  rate of 208% per year).   Isaacs contacted\n\nAyala  in  July  of  1991, after  Ayala  had  stopped making\n\npayments, to  pressure Ayala  to pay  off  the entire  loan.\n\nAyala eventually sought help from the authorities and agreed\n\nto help record conversations with Isaacs.  \n\n          Isaacs was tried before a jury and convicted.  The\n\nGovernment's   evidence  included   several  recordings   of\n\nconversations that  supported the allegations  of extortion.\n\nIn addition, there was proof that Isaacs broke  into Ayala's\n\nhome  and threatened  Ayala with  a pistol  in front  of his\n\nthree small  children.   At sentencing,  the district  court\n\nincreased  Isaacs'  offense  level under  the  United States\n\nSentencing  Guidelines   (the  \"Sentencing   Guidelines\"  or\n\n\"Guidelines\" or  \"U.S.S.G\") by  two points  for perjury  and\n\nintimidation of a  witness and then refused  Isaacs' request\n\nfor a  downward departure based  on his history of  abuse at\n\nthe hands of his father.   However, the court allowed Isaacs\n\n                             3\n\nto challenge  a 1980  burglary conviction1  that would  have\n\nresulted  in  his  being classified  as  a  career offender,\n\ninstead of  receiving a  Criminal History  Category of  III.\n\nIsaacs  argued that he had not received effective assistance\n\nof counsel in his earlier  case because his attorney did not\n\nobject to having the case transferred from juvenile to adult\n\ncourt at a certification hearing.  The  district court found\n\nthat  Isaacs  had  demonstrated by  a  preponderance  of the\n\nevidence  that his prior conviction was unconstitutional and\n\nrefused  to consider either the conviction or the underlying\n\nconduct as  a basis  for changing  Isaacs' Criminal  History\n\nCategory.   As  a  result,  Isaacs faced  97  to 121  months\n\nimprisonment rather than 210 to 262 months and was sentenced\n\nto 108 months.\n\n                         DISCUSSION\n                                   \n\n          This case raises three issues.  First, we consider\n\nwhether U.S.S.G.  4A1.2 gives  a sentencing court discretion\n\nto  allow  a  defendant   to  challenge  the  constitutional\n\nvalidity of a prior conviction that is being used to enhance\n\nhis or her  Criminal History Category.   Second, we  address\n\nthe  question whether Isaacs  had a constitutional  right to\n\n                    \n\n1Isaacs  was arrested  in August  of 1980  and  charged with\nseveral  burglaries  that  occurred  during  June and  July.\nIsaacs was 17 at the time and was not living at home.\n\n                             4\n\nchallenge his prior  conviction at sentencing.   Finally, we\n\nevaluate  Isaacs'   contention  that   the  district   court\n\ncommitted  reversible  error  in admitting  evidence  of his\n\nrelatives' alleged criminal behavior.\n\nI.        The Government's Appeal\n                                 \n\n          A.   Section 4A1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines\n                                                         \n\n          The  Government   contends  that   the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  do not  provide a  sentencing  court independent\n\nauthority   to  permit   a  collateral   challenge  to   the\n\nconstitutionality  of a  prior  conviction  where the  prior\n\nconviction is being  used to compute a  defendant's Criminal\n\nHistory Category.   We agree.   The dispute over  this issue\n\nconcerns Comment  6 to   4A1.2, and,  in particular, a  1990\n\namendment to the Guidelines that altered Comment 6 and added\n\na background note to the comment section.  \n\n          Prior to the  1990 amendment, Comment 6  to  4A1.2\n\nof the Guidelines stated:\n\n          Invalid    Convictions.        Sentences\n                                \n          resulting  from  convictions  that  have\n          been  reversed  or  vacated  because  of\n          errors   of    law,   or    because   of\n          subsequently-discovered         evidence\n          exonerating the defendant, are not to be\n          counted.   Any other  sentence resulting\n          in a valid  conviction is to be  counted\n          in   the    criminal   history    score.\n          Convictions which the defendant shows to\n                                                  \n          have been  constitutionally invalid  may\n                                                  \n\n                             5\n\n          not be  counted in the  criminal history\n                                                  \n          score.  Also, if to count an uncounseled\n               \n          misdemeanor conviction  would result  in\n          the   imposition   of  a   sentence   of\n          imprisonment  under  circumstances  that\n          would   violate   the    United   States\n          Constitution, then such conviction shall\n          not be counted  in the criminal  history\n          score.  Nonetheless, any conviction that\n          is not  counted in the  criminal history\n          score  may  be  considered  pursuant  to\n           4A1.3 if it  provides reliable evidence\n          of past criminal activity.  \n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.2,  comment  (n.6)  (Nov.  1,  1989)  (second\n\nemphasis  added).  The courts which interpreted this Comment\n\nuniformly found that the  Guidelines authorized or  required\n\nthe  constitutional   review   of   prior   convictions   at\n\nsentencing.  See, e.g., United States v. Mims, 928 F.2d 310,\n                                             \n\n312  (9th Cir.  1991); United  States v.  Edwards, 911  F.2d\n                                                 \n\n1031, 1035 (5th Cir. 1990); United States v. Jones, 907 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n456, 460-69  (4th Cir.  1990), cert.  denied, 498 U.S.  1029\n                                            \n\n(1991).  \n\n          However,  the  Sentencing Commission  amended  the\n\ncomment  section for  4A1.2  in 1990, thereby  reopening the\n\nquestion whether the Guidelines provide district courts with\n\nindependent  authority to  review  the constitutionality  of\n\nprior convictions.   Cf. Stinson v. United  States,     U.S.\n                                                  \n\n   ,  113 S.  Ct. 1913  (1993)  (Interpretive commentary  in\n\nGuidelines is binding authority for federal courts even when\n\ncontrary to  prior judicial  interpretation of  Guidelines).\n\nComment 6 to  4A1.2 as thus amended provides:\n\n                             6\n\n          Reversed,   Vacated,    or   Invalidated\n                                                  \n          Convictions.   Sentences resulting  from\n                     \n          convictions that  have been  reversed or\n          vacated  because of  errors  of law,  or\n          because    of    subsequently-discovered\n          evidence exonerating the  defendant, are\n          not  to  be  counted.   Also,  sentences\n          resulting   from   convictions   that  a\n          defendant shows to  have been previously\n                                                  \n          ruled constitutionally  invalid are  not\n               \n          to   be  counted.     Nonetheless,   the\n          criminal    conduct    underlying    any\n          conviction  that is  not counted  in the\n          criminal history score may be considered\n          pursuant to  4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal\n          History Category).\n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.2,  comment  (n.6)  (Nov.  1,  1991)  (second\n\nemphasis added).   In short, Comment 6 no  longer deals with\n\ncollateral  challenges  at  all,  but  simply  instructs the\n\nsentencing court  to disregard  convictions  that have  been\n\n\"previously  ruled   unconstitutional.\"     Nevertheless,  a\n\nbackground note  added to  the comment section  at the  same\n\ntime states in pertinent part:\n\n          The   Commission   leaves    for   court\n          determination  the  issue of  whether  a\n          defendant  may  collaterally  attack  at\n          sentencing a prior conviction.\n\n          The courts that have  assessed the revised comment\n\nsection  to  4A1.2 have  accordingly divided on  whether the\n\nGuidelines  continue  to  authorize  the  review   of  prior\n\nconvictions.   Compare United States  v. Byrd, 995  F.2d 536\n                                             \n\n(4th Cir. 1993) (Wilkins, J.)

We  find this  view  persuasive.2   The  1990\n\namendment to Comment  6 removed the language  that served to\n\nauthorize first  time collateral review of prior convictions\n\nand  replaced it  with language  permitting  review only  of\n\nconvictions  \"previously ruled  invalid.\"   As the  Eleventh\n\nCircuit recognized in  Roman, \"[n]o language  now in Note  6\n                            \n\nauthorizes collateral review.\"  Roman, 989 F.2d 1117, 1119.\n                                     \n\n          The  problem  is,  of  course,  more  difficult by\n\nvirtue of  the appended  background note  which leaves  \"for\n\ncourt determination  the issue  of whether  a defendant  may\n\ncollaterally attack at  sentencing a prior conviction.\"   We\n\nbelieve that this note does not provide an independent basis\n\nfor  the  review  of prior  convictions,  given  the revised\n\nlanguage of Comment 6 itself.  Instead, the  background note\n\nmay be  best understood  as a signal,  somewhat faint  to be\n\nsure,  that the Sentencing  Commission had not  attempted to\n\nresolve whether the Constitution requires a sentencing court\n\nto review the  constitutionality of a prior  conviction that\n\nis being used to enhance a  sentence -- an issue we  address\n\nbelow.  As the Roman court stated, \"[t]he Background Comment\n                    \n\n                    \n\n2The  Commission's  explanation  for  the  amendment  states\nunhelpfully that the  amendment \"clarifies the circumstances\nunder which prior  sentences are excluded from  the criminal\nhistory score.\"   U.S.S.G. App.  C, Amendment  353, at  171.\nThe focus  of the  amendment explanation appears  to be  the\naddition  of  uncounseled misdemeanor  convictions  to those\nconvictions  that are used to determine the criminal history\nscore.

Constitutional Considerations\n                                            \n\n          Although the district court based its  decision to\n\nreview the constitutionality of Isaacs' prior conviction  on\n\nthe  mistaken belief that  the Guidelines authorized  such a\n\nreview,  we must still  address Isaacs' contention  that the\n\nConstitution guarantees the right to challenge  collaterally\n\nprior convictions at  sentencing.  In opposition  to Isaacs'\n\nposition, the Government advocates the position taken by the\n\nEleventh Circuit in Roman -- that the Constitution  does not\n                         \n\nrequire sentencing  courts to  permit defendants  to make  a\n\n                    \n\n3A  recent  amendment  to  the  comment  section  of   4A1.2\nsuggests that the  Commission did not intend  the Guidelines\nto provide an  independent basis for  a sentencing court  to\nreview  the constitutionality  of  prior convictions.    See\n                                                            \nU.S.S.G.    4A1.2,  comment  (n.6)  (Nov.  1,  1993).    The\namendment directly confronts the  \"inter-circuit conflict in\ninterpreting the commentary by stating more clearly that the\nCommission does not intend to enlarge a defendant's right to\nattack  collaterally  a  prior  conviction  at  the  current\nsentencing proceeding beyond any right otherwise  recognized\nin   law.\"    Proposed   Amendment  20  to   the  Sentencing\nGuidelines,  Policy  Statements,   and  Official  Commentary\n(April  30, 1993).  Despite this  clear statement of intent,\nwe  note that  the amendment  did not  go into  effect until\nNovember 1, 1993.  Thus, we do  not rely on the amendment to\nhold   that  the  Guidelines   do  not  provide  independent\nauthority for collateral review of prior convictions.\n\n                             11\n\ncollateral  challenge  to  prior convictions  at  sentencing\n\nunless the  alleged constitutional error  is so grave  as to\n\nmake  the   prior  conviction  \"presumptively  void.\"    The\n\nGovernment further  contends that  Isaacs' challenge  to his\n\nprior  conviction does  not  meet  the \"presumptively  void\"\n\ncriteria.4 \n\n          We begin by  observing that the Supreme  Court has\n\nso far  declined to  consider whether  due process  requires\n\n\"state courts to permit challenges to  guilty pleas used for\n\nenhancement purposes.\"  Parke v.  Raley, 113 S. Ct. 517, 523\n                                       \n\n(1992) (due process clause permits state to impose burden of\n\nproduction on recidivist  defendant who challenges  validity\n\nof prior  conviction under Boykin  v. Alabama, 395  U.S. 238\n                                             \n\n(1969)).    Nonetheless,  both  Isaacs  and  the  Government\n\ncontend  that guidance  on this  issue  can be  found in  an\n\nanalysis of two Supreme Court cases handed down prior to the\n\nimplementation of  the Sentencing Guidelines:  United States\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n4The government also argues that the interests of comity and\njudicial economy suggest  that prior convictions should  not\nbe reviewed at  sentencing.  These arguments do  not hold as\nmuch  water  as they  might  since they  have  been rejected\nalready  by  this  court  in  Paleo.   As  the  Paleo  court\n                                                     \nrecognized,  \"`comity' considerations  are  absent (or  less\nweighty) . .  . when a  federal court refuses  to rely on  a\nstate conviction as a basis for imposing a  federal sentence\nfor a federal  crime.\"  Paleo,  967 F.2d at 12.   Similarly,\n                             \njudicial  economy is  not a  reason  to preclude  collateral\nreview because this concern can be dealt with by placing the\nburden of proof on the defendant.

It had been\n                        \n\n\"conclusively  determined\"  in   a  collateral  state  court\n\nproceeding that the prior convictions were \"constitutionally\n\ninvalid.\"   Tucker, 404  U.S. at 444-45.   The  Tucker Court\n                                                      \n\nheld that the case should  be remanded to the district court\n\nfor  reconsideration  of  the   sentence  imposed  upon  the\n\ndefendant because the sentence was \"founded at least in part\n\nupon misinformation of  constitutional magnitude.\"   Id.  at\n                                                        \n\n447.  As the Tucker Court explained, \"the real question here\n                   \n\nis not  whether the results  of the . .  . proceedings might\n\nhave been different if the  respondent had had counsel,  but\n\nwhether the sentence . . .  might have been different if the\n\nsentencing  judge  had known  that  . .  .  the respondent's\n\nprevious convictions had  been unconstitutionally obtained.\"\n\nId. at 448.  \n   \n\n          The Tucker  Court's  holding does  not  provide  a\n                    \n\nbasis for finding that a  defendant has a right to challenge\n\nprior convictions at sentencing for the first time.   Tucker\n                                                            \n\naddresses  the situation  where prior  convictions  that are\n\nused to enhance a sentence  have been found previously to be\n\n                             13\n\nunconstitutional -- not the situation addressed here,  where\n\nthe   prior  conviction   has  not  previously   been  found\n\nunconstitutional.  Tucker thus does not aid us.\n                         \n\n          Burgett, which also  addressed a Gideon violation,\n                                                 \n\nis more  relevant.    In  the Burgett  case,  the  defendant\n                                     \n\nchallenged  a  sentence   enhancement  based   on  a   prior\n\nconviction that on its face appeared to be unconstitutional,\n\nthough there had been no  prior determination that it was in\n\nfact unconstitutional.   The certified copy of  the judgment\n\noffered by the  Government at trial to prove  the conviction\n\nin  question  stated  that the  defendant  had  been without\n\ncounsel.  The  Burgett Court held that it  would be improper\n                      \n\nto  presume from  a  silent record  that  the defendant  had\n\nwaived  his  right  to  counsel  and  that,  therefore,  the\n\njudgment of conviction raised \"a presumption that petitioner\n\nwas denied his right to counsel.\"  Burgett, 389 U.S. at 114.\n                                          \n\nIn language  that foreshadows  the decision  in Tucker,  the\n                                                      \n\nBurgett Court went on to  say that \"[t]o permit a conviction\n       \n\nobtained in  violation of  Gideon v.

The Roman court, however, was not required to\n                        \n\nand did not reach the  question of what kinds of convictions\n\nare  \"presumptively  void.\"    We  examine  that  additional\n\nquestion  to  determine  whether  the   district  court  was\n\nrequired to review Isaacs' ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim.\n\n          The Government suggests  that \"presumptively void\"\n\nconvictions may include  a claim of lack of  counsel but not\n\n                    \n\n5In  a thoughtful concurring  opinion in Roman,  Chief Judge\n                                              \nTjoflat  disagreed with  the \"presumptively  void\" test  and\nsuggested instead that the sentencing court must entertain a\nconstitutional  challenge to a prior conviction only if \"(1)\nthe  offender  denies  the conduct,  and  (2)  the objection\nundermines the presumption associated with the  conviction.\"\n989 F.2d at 1129.\n          We do not  adopt the two-part test  recommended by\nChief Judge  Tjoflat primarily  because we  do not  think it\nappropriate  to require a  defendant to deny  the underlying\nconduct of a prior conviction  in order to challenge the use\nof the  conviction under   4A1.2.   When  confronted with  a\nsimilar argument, concerning  a defendant unconstitutionally\nconvicted  but allegedly guilty of the underlying conduct of\nthe conviction, the Tucker Court replied that \"[i]t would be\n                          \n. .  .  callous  to  assume,  now  that  the  constitutional\ninvalidity  of  the  respondent's  previous  convictions  is\nclear,  that  the  trial  judge  will  upon  reconsideration\n`undoubtedly'  impose the same sentence he imposed in 1953.\"\nTucker, 404  U.S. at  449 n.8.   Citing Burgett,  the Tucker\n                                                            \nCourt  also  expressed  a   concern  that  the  use  of   an\nunconstitutional  conviction  to  enhance a  sentence  would\nerode the violated constitutional principle.  Id. at 449. \n                                                 \n          Moreover,   the   Sentencing   Guidelines  already\nprovide  a sentencing court  with the authority  to impose a\nsentence that reflects prior criminal conduct not taken into\naccount  by valid prior  convictions.  See  U.S.S.G.  4A1.3,\n                                          \np.s.

In  Custis, the\n                                                       \n\nFourth Circuit found that the Gideon violations at issue  in\n                                    \n\nBurgett  and  Tucker  were  \"different  in  kind\"  from  the\n                    \n\nineffective assistance  of counsel claims, noting  that lack\n\nof counsel claims \"will ordinarily lend themselves to facial\n\nreview  from  the  state  court  documents  offered  by  the\n\ngovernment to establish the conviction.\"  Id. at 1360-61.\n                                             \n\n          Although  we agree with the outcome the Government\n\nrecommends, we think it necessary to clarify the appropriate\n\ntest  to determine  whether a  conviction is  \"presumptively\n\nvoid.\"  \n\n          As  an  initial  matter,  a  prior  conviction  is\n\n\"presumptively  void\" if a  constitutional violation  can be\n\nfound  on the face of  the prior conviction, without further\n\nfactual  investigation.     Contrary  to   the  Government's\n\nposition, the Burgett Court did not rest its decision on the\n                     \n\ndifference between  lack of  counsel claims  and ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claims -- a distinction that generally\n\nhas not  been meaningful since  Powell v.

Instead, we note that the Burgett decision was\n                                               \n\nbased on a judgment facially showing lack of any counsel and\n\nthat most claims  of inadequacy of  counsel are unlikely  to\n\nmeet its \"presumptively void\" test.  Indeed, even as to lack\n\n                             16\n\nof counsel, the Supreme Court  in Parke noted that \"[a]t the\n                                       \n\ntime the prior  conviction at issue in  Burgett was entered,\n                                               \n\nstate criminal defendants'  federal constitutional right  to\n\ncounsel  had  not  yet  been   recognized,  and  so  it  was\n\nreasonable to  presume that the  defendant had not  waived a\n\nright he did not possess.\"  Parke, 113 S. Ct. at 524.\n                                 \n\n          Under limited circumstances, however, a conviction\n\nmay  be  \"presumptively  void\"  even  if  a   constitutional\n\nviolation  cannot  be  found  on  the   face  of  the  prior\n\nconviction.   The  Supreme Court  has  recognized that  some\n\nconstitutional violations are so serious as to undermine the\n\nreliability  of  an  entire criminal  proceeding.

Where an\n\noffender  challenges the validity  of a prior  conviction on\n\n\"structural\"  grounds, therefore,  a  district court  should\n\nentertain the challenge  whether or not the error appears on\n\nthe face of the prior conviction.6 \n\n          We  conclude that  the  district court  should not\n\nhave  entertained Isaacs' challenge to the prior conviction.\n\nFirst, Isaacs' challenge required the district court in this\n\ncase to  go beyond the  evidence of conviction  presented by\n\nthe Government and conduct a factual investigation.  Second,\n\nIsaacs  did not challenge his prior conviction on structural\n\ngrounds.   It  is  of course  well settled  that ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claims are subject to \"harmless error\"\n\nreview.   Strickland  v.

Isaacs' Appeal\n                        \n\n          Isaacs  appeals the  district court's  decision to\n\nadmit into evidence  at trial an indictment  brought against\n\nhis father and  cousins regarding his father's  loansharking\n\noperation.  In addition, Isaacs challenges  the Government's\n\nexamination  of  witnesses  that  brought  out  evidence  of\n\nIsaacs' family's criminal activity.\n\n          These  arguments are  unpersuasive.   Although the\n\nadmitted evidence had the potential of prejudicing Isaacs on\n\nthe basis of the bad acts of others,  the evidence was quite\n\nrelevant.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403 (relevant evidence excluded\n              \n\nonly if  probative  value is  \"substantially outweighed\"  by\n\ndanger of unfair  prejudice).  As the Government argues, the\n\nindictment  provides a  context to  the  statements made  by\n\nIsaacs to  Ayala, a motive for Isaacs' actions, and evidence\n\n                    \n\n7We  need   not  respond  to  the   government's  additional\ncontention that the district court erred in determining that\nIsaacs'  right  to  effective  assistance   of  counsel  was\nviolated at his  1980 certification hearing because  we find\nthat    the   court   should    not   have   addressed   the\nconstitutionality  of the prior  conviction.  Nor,  in these\ncircumstances,  need we  anticipate  the applicability  of a\nvariation  of the  \"procedural default\"  test for  obtaining\ncollateral review of a prior conviction.  See,  e.g., United\n                                                            \nStates  v. Frady, 456  U.S. 152, 166  (1982) (affirming \"the\n                \nwell-settled principle  that to  obtain collateral relief  a\nprisoner must clear a significantly higher hurdle than would\nexist on direct appeal\").\n\n                             19\n\nof  the  requisite  intent.   Moreover,  the  district judge\n\nprovided  several  warnings   to  the  jury  to   limit  the\n\npotentially improper effect  of the evidence.   For example,\n\nthe  trial  judge  charged  the jury  that  \"[t]here  is  no\n\nevidence  that anybody before  you in that  [Leonard Isaacs'\n\ncase] has been  convicted.  It serves as  background to this\n\ncase to  say that  Mr. Leonard Isaacs  was accused  of these\n\nevents, together with some other people.\"  \n\n          Likewise,   the   cross-examination    of   Isaacs\n\nregarding  his knowledge  of his  family's  alleged criminal\n\nactivities  did  not  improperly   prejudice  him.    Isaacs\n\ntestified that his  contact with Ayala was  not extortionate\n\nand  that he did not conspire with his father to collect the\n\ndebt.   The  questions asked  by  the Government  concerning\n\nIsaacs'  knowledge  of  his  family's  alleged  loansharking\n\nactivity  directly   confronted  this  testimony   and  were\n\ntherefore proper.\n\n          Finally, given the  substantial evidence of  guilt\n\nprovided  by the  tape recordings  of conversations  between\n\nIsaacs and Ayala and the  evidence provided by Ayala's nine-\n\nyear-old  daughter, who testified  that Isaacs used  his own\n\ngun in rebuttal to Isaacs' testimony that he was examining a\n\ngun owned by Ayala, any error in this regard was harmless.\n\n                         CONCLUSION\n                                   \n\n                             20\n\n          Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\n\nreversed  in part  and  affirmed  in part.    We remand  for\n\nresentencing consistent with this opinion.\n\n                             21\n\n          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting in part).   I\n                                  \n\nagree  with the majority's lucid treatment of the collateral\n\nattack issue,  and believe that it is  an important addition\n\nto our jurisprudence.   Unfortunately, I cannot  endorse the\n\nentire  opinion.      The   majority   summarily   dismisses\n\nappellant's   arguments   concerning  the   alleged   404(b)\n\nevidence.   On  close  examination,  however,  the  82  page\n\nindictment of appellant's father and other relatives,  which\n\ndid  not  mention appellant,  was  unfairly prejudicial  and\n\nshould have  been excluded  under Federal  Rule of  Evidence\n\n403.  Appellant deserves a new trial on the merits.\n\n          I  begin with  a preliminary  matter.   While  the\n\nmajority  does not  cite  Rule 404(b),  it  uses the  Rule's\n\nlanguage when it states that the \"bad acts\" could be used to\n\nshow \"motive\" and \"intent.\"  Furthermore, the parties argued\n\nextensively under the Rule.  While I assume, thus, that Rule\n\n404(b) is a part of the opinion, it should not be.\n\n          Rule  404(b) excludes  the  use  of other  crimes,\n\nwrongs or acts in order  to show a defendant's character and\n\naction in conformity with it.  Such evidence must be crimes,\n\nwrongs or acts  committed by the defendant or  by the person\n                                          \n\nwho is sought to  be impeached.  United States v. David, 940\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 722,  736 (1st Cir.  1991) (\"Objections  based on  Rule\n\n404(b) may be raised only by the person whose 'other crimes,\n\nwrongs,  or acts'  are attempted  to  be revealed\");  United\n                                                            \n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nStates  v. Gonz lez-S nchez,  825 F.2d  572,  583 (1st  Cir.\n                           \n\n1987)  (\"Rule  404(b)  does not  exclude  evidence  of prior\n\ncrimes  of persons  other  than  the  defendant\").   In  the\n\npresent  case  the  allegedly   404(b)  evidence  refers  to\n\nevidence  introduced  of  other crimes,  wrongs  or  acts by\n\npersons other than appellant.  It is thus inadmissible under\n                  \n\nthat rule. \n\n          The     inapplicability     of     Rule     404(b)\n\nnotwithstanding, the  prejudicial impact  of the  indictment\n\nsubstantially outweighed  any probative value.  It tarnished\n\nappellant  merely  because  of  his  relationship  with  its\n\ntargets, and because  of its sheer  weight.  The  indictment\n\nrequired over eighty  pages and forty-nine counts  to detail\n\nthe scope  of  the father's  racketeering  operation,  which\n\ninvolved eleven  victims, hundreds of  thousands of dollars,\n\nextortionate collection schemes,  and illegal debts.   To be\n\nsure, it was  a formidable document describing  a formidable\n\ncriminal scheme.  However, it did not implicate appellant in\n\nthat  scheme in  any way.   The  danger that the  jury would\n\nassociate appellant with the scheme was too great to justify\n\nadmission of the indictment.  United States v. St. Michael's\n                                                            \n\nCredit Union, 880 F.2d 579, 601-02 (1st Cir. 1989) (evidence\n            \n\nconcerning  prior  bad  acts  of  father  was  impermissibly\n\nprejudicial when defendant  was not implicated in them).  In\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nshort, I believe  that the majority has discounted  the real\n\ndanger of guilt by association in this case.\n\n          The  majority  contends  that  the indictment  was\n\nrelevant to show context, motive  and intent.  While I grant\n\nthat information  concerning Mr.  Isaacs disability  bore at\n\nleast some  relevance to  show motive,  I cannot fathom  any\n\nneed  to introduce the  indictment itself to  bring out this\n\npoint.   The use of the indictment was unfairly inflammatory\n\nwhen  compared  with whatever  minimal  probative impact  it\n\nmight hold.  It was an abuse of discretion for the  district\n\ncourt to admit the evidence.\n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n",

This  case consists\n                                      \n\nof  cross  appeals  from a  judgment  of  the  United States\n\nDistrict Court  for the  District of  Massachusetts, Rya  W.\n\nZobel, Judge.   The Government appeals both the  decision of\n            \n\nthe  court  to  entertain  a  collateral  challenge  to  the\n\nconstitutionality  of a prior  conviction at  sentencing and\n\nthe  decision of  the court  that the  prior conviction  was\n\nconstitutionally  invalid.   The  defendant, Edward  Isaacs,\n\nappeals his conviction  on the basis that the district court\n\nimproperly allowed  into evidence an indictment  against his\n\nfather and cousins and  improperly allowed him to be  cross-\n\nexamined concerning his knowledge of  his relatives' alleged\n\nloansharking  enterprise.  For the reasons below, we reverse\n\nthe  district court's  decision  that it  had  the power  to\n\nreview the constitutionality of Isaacs' prior conviction and\n\naffirm  its decision  to admit  the  indictment against  his\n\nfather into evidence and to allow him to be questioned about\n\nthe activities of his relatives.\n\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                   \n\n          Isaacs  was convicted of  one count  of conspiracy\n\nand  one  count of  using extortionate  means to  attempt to\n\ncollect a loan, in  violation of 18  U.S.C.    2 and  894(a)\n\n(1988).   According  to  the  Government,  racketeering  and\n\nloansharking was something of a family business.  Isaacs got\n\ninvolved  in the \"business\"  after his father,  Leonard, was\n\n                             2\n\nindicted, placed  under house arrest,  and developed  health\n\nproblems.  Isaacs' conviction is  based on his dealings with\n\none  of his  father's alleged  loansharking  victims, Robert\n\nAyala.  Ayala  had borrowed $2,500 from  Leonard in November\n\nof 1990 and had been making weekly interest payments of $100\n\n(for an interest  rate of 208% per year).   Isaacs contacted\n\nAyala  in  July  of  1991, after  Ayala  had  stopped making\n\npayments, to  pressure Ayala  to pay  off  the entire  loan.\n\nAyala eventually sought help from the authorities and agreed\n\nto help record conversations with Isaacs.  \n\n          Isaacs was tried before a jury and convicted.  The\n\nGovernment's   evidence  included   several  recordings   of\n\nconversations that  supported the allegations  of extortion.\n\nIn addition, there was proof that Isaacs broke  into Ayala's\n\nhome  and threatened  Ayala with  a pistol  in front  of his\n\nthree small  children.   At sentencing,  the district  court\n\nincreased  Isaacs'  offense  level under  the  United States\n\nSentencing  Guidelines   (the  \"Sentencing   Guidelines\"  or\n\n\"Guidelines\" or  \"U.S.S.G\") by  two points  for perjury  and\n\nintimidation of a  witness and then refused  Isaacs' request\n\nfor a  downward departure based  on his history of  abuse at\n\nthe hands of his father.   However, the court allowed Isaacs\n\n                             3\n\nto challenge  a 1980  burglary conviction1  that would  have\n\nresulted  in  his  being classified  as  a  career offender,\n\ninstead of  receiving a  Criminal History  Category of  III.\n\nIsaacs  argued that he had not received effective assistance\n\nof counsel in his earlier  case because his attorney did not\n\nobject to having the case transferred from juvenile to adult\n\ncourt at a certification hearing.  The  district court found\n\nthat  Isaacs  had  demonstrated by  a  preponderance  of the\n\nevidence  that his prior conviction was unconstitutional and\n\nrefused  to consider either the conviction or the underlying\n\nconduct as  a basis  for changing  Isaacs' Criminal  History\n\nCategory.   As  a  result,  Isaacs faced  97  to 121  months\n\nimprisonment rather than 210 to 262 months and was sentenced\n\nto 108 months.\n\n                         DISCUSSION\n                                   \n\n          This case raises three issues.  First, we consider\n\nwhether U.S.S.G.  4A1.2 gives  a sentencing court discretion\n\nto  allow  a  defendant   to  challenge  the  constitutional\n\nvalidity of a prior conviction that is being used to enhance\n\nhis or her  Criminal History Category.   Second, we  address\n\nthe  question whether Isaacs  had a constitutional  right to\n\n                    \n\n1Isaacs  was arrested  in August  of 1980  and  charged with\nseveral  burglaries  that  occurred  during  June and  July.\nIsaacs was 17 at the time and was not living at home.\n\n                             4\n\nchallenge his prior  conviction at sentencing.   Finally, we\n\nevaluate  Isaacs'   contention  that   the  district   court\n\ncommitted  reversible  error  in admitting  evidence  of his\n\nrelatives' alleged criminal behavior.\n\nI.        The Government's Appeal\n                                 \n\n          A.   Section 4A1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines\n                                                         \n\n          The  Government   contends  that   the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  do not  provide a  sentencing  court independent\n\nauthority   to  permit   a  collateral   challenge  to   the\n\nconstitutionality  of a  prior  conviction  where the  prior\n\nconviction is being  used to compute a  defendant's Criminal\n\nHistory Category.   We agree.   The dispute over  this issue\n\nconcerns Comment  6 to   4A1.2, and,  in particular, a  1990\n\namendment to the Guidelines that altered Comment 6 and added\n\na background note to the comment section.  \n\n          Prior to the  1990 amendment, Comment 6  to  4A1.2\n\nof the Guidelines stated:\n\n          Invalid    Convictions.        Sentences\n                                \n          resulting  from  convictions  that  have\n          been  reversed  or  vacated  because  of\n          errors   of    law,   or    because   of\n          subsequently-discovered         evidence\n          exonerating the defendant, are not to be\n          counted.   Any other  sentence resulting\n          in a valid  conviction is to be  counted\n          in   the    criminal   history    score.\n          Convictions which the defendant shows to\n                                                  \n          have been  constitutionally invalid  may\n                                                  \n\n                             5\n\n          not be  counted in the  criminal history\n                                                  \n          score.  Also, if to count an uncounseled\n               \n          misdemeanor conviction  would result  in\n          the   imposition   of  a   sentence   of\n          imprisonment  under  circumstances  that\n          would   violate   the    United   States\n          Constitution, then such conviction shall\n          not be counted  in the criminal  history\n          score.  Nonetheless, any conviction that\n          is not  counted in the  criminal history\n          score  may  be  considered  pursuant  to\n           4A1.3 if it  provides reliable evidence\n          of past criminal activity.  \n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.2,  comment  (n.6)  (Nov.  1,  1989)  (second\n\nemphasis  added).

We  find this  view  persuasive.2   The  1990\n\namendment to Comment  6 removed the language  that served to\n\nauthorize first  time collateral review of prior convictions\n\nand  replaced it  with language  permitting  review only  of\n\nconvictions  \"previously ruled  invalid.\"   As the  Eleventh\n\nCircuit recognized in  Roman, \"[n]o language  now in Note  6\n                            \n\nauthorizes collateral review.\"  Roman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1119.\n                                     \n\n          The  problem  is,  of  course,  more  difficult by\n\nvirtue of  the appended  background note  which leaves  \"for\n\ncourt determination  the issue  of whether  a defendant  may\n\ncollaterally attack at  sentencing a prior conviction.\"   We\n\nbelieve that this note does not provide an independent basis\n\nfor  the  review  of prior  convictions,  given  the revised\n\nlanguage of Comment 6 itself.  Instead, the  background note\n\nmay be  best understood  as a signal,  somewhat faint  to be\n\nsure,  that the Sentencing  Commission had not  attempted to\n\nresolve whether the Constitution requires a sentencing court\n\nto review the  constitutionality of a prior  conviction that\n\nis being used to enhance a  sentence -- an issue we  address\n\nbelow.  As the Roman court stated, \"[t]he Background Comment\n                    \n\n                    \n\n2The  Commission's  explanation  for  the  amendment  states\nunhelpfully that the  amendment \"clarifies the circumstances\nunder which prior  sentences are excluded from  the criminal\nhistory score.\"   U.S.S.G.

Constitutional Considerations\n                                            \n\n          Although the district court based its  decision to\n\nreview the constitutionality of Isaacs' prior conviction  on\n\nthe  mistaken belief that  the Guidelines authorized  such a\n\nreview,  we must still  address Isaacs' contention  that the\n\nConstitution guarantees the right to challenge  collaterally\n\nprior convictions at  sentencing.  In opposition  to Isaacs'\n\nposition, the Government advocates the position taken by the\n\nEleventh Circuit in Roman -- that the Constitution  does not\n                         \n\nrequire sentencing  courts to  permit defendants  to make  a\n\n                    \n\n3A  recent  amendment  to  the  comment  section  of   4A1.2\nsuggests that the  Commission did not intend  the Guidelines\nto provide an  independent basis for  a sentencing court  to\nreview  the constitutionality  of  prior convictions.    See\n                                                            \nU.S.S.G.    4A1.2,  comment  (n.6)  (Nov.  1,  1993).    The\namendment directly confronts the  \"inter-circuit conflict in\ninterpreting the commentary by stating more clearly that the\nCommission does not intend to enlarge a defendant's right to\nattack  collaterally  a  prior  conviction  at  the  current\nsentencing proceeding beyond any right otherwise  recognized\nin   law.\"    Proposed   Amendment  20  to   the  Sentencing\nGuidelines,  Policy  Statements,   and  Official  Commentary\n(April  30, 1993).  Despite this  clear statement of intent,\nwe  note that  the amendment  did not  go into  effect until\nNovember 1, 1993.  Thus, we do  not rely on the amendment to\nhold   that  the  Guidelines   do  not  provide  independent\nauthority for collateral review of prior convictions.\n\n                             11\n\ncollateral  challenge  to  prior convictions  at  sentencing\n\nunless the  alleged constitutional error  is so grave  as to\n\nmake  the   prior  conviction  \"presumptively  void.\"    The\n\nGovernment further  contends that  Isaacs' challenge  to his\n\nprior  conviction does  not  meet  the \"presumptively  void\"\n\ncriteria.4 \n\n          We begin by  observing that the Supreme  Court has\n\nso far  declined to  consider whether  due process  requires\n\n\"state courts to permit challenges to  guilty pleas used for\n\nenhancement purposes.\"  Parke v.

Nonetheless,  both  Isaacs  and  the  Government\n\ncontend  that guidance  on this  issue  can be  found in  an\n\nanalysis of two Supreme Court cases handed down prior to the\n\nimplementation of  the Sentencing Guidelines:  United States\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n4The government also argues that the interests of comity and\njudicial economy suggest  that prior convictions should  not\nbe reviewed at  sentencing.  These arguments do  not hold as\nmuch  water  as they  might  since they  have  been rejected\nalready  by  this  court  in  Paleo.   As  the  Paleo  court\n                                                     \nrecognized,  \"`comity' considerations  are  absent (or  less\nweighty) . .  . when a  federal court refuses  to rely on  a\nstate conviction as a basis for imposing a  federal sentence\nfor a federal  crime.\"  Paleo,  967 F.2d at 12.   Similarly,\n                             \njudicial  economy is  not a  reason  to preclude  collateral\nreview because this concern can be dealt with by placing the\nburden of proof on the defendant.

In  the Burgett  case,  the  defendant\n                                     \n\nchallenged  a  sentence   enhancement  based   on  a   prior\n\nconviction that on its face appeared to be unconstitutional,\n\nthough there had been no  prior determination that it was in\n\nfact unconstitutional.   The certified copy of  the judgment\n\noffered by the  Government at trial to prove  the conviction\n\nin  question  stated  that the  defendant  had  been without\n\ncounsel.  The  Burgett Court held that it  would be improper\n                      \n\nto  presume from  a  silent record  that  the defendant  had\n\nwaived  his  right  to  counsel  and  that,  therefore,  the\n\njudgment of conviction raised \"a presumption that petitioner\n\nwas denied his right to counsel.\"  Burgett, 389 U.S. at 114.\n                                          \n\nIn language  that foreshadows  the decision  in Tucker,  the\n                                                      \n\nBurgett Court went on to  say that \"[t]o permit a conviction\n       \n\nobtained in  violation of  Gideon v.

Isaacs' Appeal\n                        \n\n          Isaacs  appeals the  district court's  decision to\n\nadmit into evidence  at trial an indictment  brought against\n\nhis father and  cousins regarding his father's  loansharking\n\noperation.  In addition, Isaacs challenges  the Government's\n\nexamination  of  witnesses  that  brought  out  evidence  of\n\nIsaacs' family's criminal activity.\n\n          These  arguments are  unpersuasive.   Although the\n\nadmitted evidence had the potential of prejudicing Isaacs on\n\nthe basis of the bad acts of others,  the evidence was quite\n\nrelevant.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403 (relevant evidence excluded\n              \n\nonly if  probative  value is  \"substantially outweighed\"  by\n\ndanger of unfair  prejudice).  As the Government argues, the\n\nindictment  provides a  context to  the  statements made  by\n\nIsaacs to  Ayala, a motive for Isaacs' actions, and evidence\n\n                    \n\n7We  need   not  respond  to  the   government's  additional\ncontention that the district court erred in determining that\nIsaacs'  right  to  effective  assistance   of  counsel  was\nviolated at his  1980 certification hearing because  we find\nthat    the   court   should    not   have   addressed   the\nconstitutionality  of the prior  conviction.  Nor,  in these\ncircumstances,  need we  anticipate  the applicability  of a\nvariation  of the  \"procedural default\"  test for  obtaining\ncollateral review of a prior conviction.  See,  e.g., United\n                                                            \nStates  v.

Moreover,  the  district judge\n\nprovided  several  warnings   to  the  jury  to   limit  the\n\npotentially improper effect  of the evidence.   For example,\n\nthe  trial  judge  charged  the jury  that  \"[t]here  is  no\n\nevidence  that anybody before  you in that  [Leonard Isaacs'\n\ncase] has been  convicted.  It serves as  background to this\n\ncase to  say that  Mr. Leonard Isaacs  was accused  of these\n\nevents, together with some other people.\"  \n\n          Likewise,   the   cross-examination    of   Isaacs\n\nregarding  his knowledge  of his  family's  alleged criminal\n\nactivities  did  not  improperly   prejudice  him.    Isaacs\n\ntestified that his  contact with Ayala was  not extortionate\n\nand  that he did not conspire with his father to collect the\n\ndebt.

I\n                                  \n\nagree  with the majority's lucid treatment of the collateral\n\nattack issue,  and believe that it is  an important addition\n\nto our jurisprudence.   Unfortunately, I cannot  endorse the\n\nentire  opinion.      The   majority   summarily   dismisses\n\nappellant's   arguments   concerning  the   alleged   404(b)\n\nevidence.

Appellant deserves a new trial on the merits.\n\n          I  begin with  a preliminary  matter.   While  the\n\nmajority  does not  cite  Rule 404(b),  it  uses the  Rule's\n\nlanguage when it states that the \"bad acts\" could be used to\n\nshow \"motive\" and \"intent.\"  Furthermore, the parties argued\n\nextensively under the Rule.  While I assume, thus, that Rule\n\n404(b) is a part of the opinion, it should not be.\n\n          Rule  404(b) excludes  the  use  of other  crimes,\n\nwrongs or acts in order  to show a defendant's character and\n\naction in conformity with it.  Such evidence must be crimes,\n\nwrongs or acts  committed by the defendant or  by the person\n                                          \n\nwho is sought to  be impeached.  United States v.

To be\n\nsure, it was  a formidable document describing  a formidable\n\ncriminal scheme.  However, it did not implicate appellant in\n\nthat  scheme in  any way.   The  danger that the  jury would\n\nassociate appellant with the scheme was too great to justify\n\nadmission of the indictment.  United States v. St. Michael's\n                                                            \n\nCredit Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526736\"><a href=\"/opinion/526736/united-states-v-st-michaels-credit-union-and-janice-sacharczyk/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 601-02 (1st Cir. 1989) (evidence\n            \n\nconcerning  prior  bad  acts  of  father  was  impermissibly\n\nprejudicial when defendant  was not implicated in them).  In\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nshort, I believe  that the majority has discounted  the real\n\ndanger of guilt by association in this case.\n\n          The  majority  contends  that  the indictment  was\n\nrelevant to show context, motive  and intent.  While I grant\n\nthat information  concerning Mr.  Isaacs disability  bore at\n\nleast some  relevance to  show motive,  I cannot fathom  any\n\nneed  to introduce the  indictment itself to  bring out this\n\npoint.   The use of the indictment was unfairly inflammatory\n\nwhen  compared  with whatever  minimal  probative impact  it\n\nmight hold.  It was an abuse of discretion for the  district\n\ncourt to admit the evidence.\n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n</pre>",
