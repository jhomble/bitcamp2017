Appellant  Glenn Cummings\n                                    \n\nbrought suit  against appellee  South Portland  Housing Authority\n\n(\"SPHA\") for:  (1) the unconstitutional deprivation of a property\n\ninterest in  continued employment  pursuant to  42 U.S.C.    1983\n\n(\"  1983\"); (2) breach of contract; (3) intentional  interference\n\nwith  prospective  employment; and  (4)  negligent infliction  of\n\nemotional distress.   The  district court adopted  a magistrate's\n\nrecommendation that appellant lacked a constitutionally protected\n\nproperty  interest  in  continued employment,  and  thus  granted\n\nsummary judgment for the SPHA on the   1983 claim.   The district\n\ncourt  also   dismissed  the  three  state   law  claims  because\n\nsupplemental  jurisdiction  was   inappropriate  once  the  court\n\ndismissed the only federal  claim.  The judgment dismissed  the  \n\n1983  claim  with  prejudice  and the  state  law  claims without\n\nprejudice.  Because we find that appellant had a constitutionally\n\nprotected  property  interest  in his  continued  employment,  we\n\nreverse and remand  the case  to the district  court for  further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          The SPHA  is a  municipal authority authorized  under a\n\nstate  enabling statute.  See Maine  Housing Authorities Act, Me.\n                             \n\nRev. Stat. Ann.  tit. 30,   4701  (West 1991).  Appellant  worked\n\nfor the SPHA as a  department head in charge of maintenance.   On\n\nMay 30, 1988, when the SPHA hired appellant, it informed him that\n\nhe would have  to serve  a probationary period  during which  the\n\nSPHA could  fire him  at any  time.   The  SPHA further  informed\n\nappellant that  after the probationary  period he would  become a\n\npermanent employee,  and that  the SPHA's personnel  policy would\n\ngovern his employment.\n\n          Sometime during  appellant's first year  of employment,\n\nhe  gave the executive director  of the SPHA  an undated, written\n\nletter of resignation, and told  him to use it if he  ever failed\n\nto  fulfill his responsibilities at the  SPHA.  On July 13, 1990,\n\nwell after the probationary  period ended, the executive director\n\npresented  appellant with this letter, stating that they had come\n\nto a \"parting of  ways.\"  Appellant then requested  a termination\n\nhearing, and the SPHA rejected that request.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nI.  Section 1983 claim\n\n          The central issue  on appeal is whether appellant had a\n\nconstitutionally protected  property  interest in  his  continued\n\nemployment.    A public  employee has  such  an interest  when he\n\nreasonably expects that his employment will continue.  Perkins v.\n                                                              \n\nBoard of  Directors, 686 F.2d  49, 51  (1st Cir. 1982).   An  \"at\n                   \n\nwill\"  employment contract creates  no reasonable  expectation of\n\ncontinued employment, while an employment agreement that  permits\n\ntermination only \"for cause\" does create that expectation.  Id.\n                                                              \n\n          Whether an employment contract permits dismissal solely\n\n\"for cause\" is a  matter of state law.   Id. at 52.   In general,\n                                           \n\nunder Maine law, \"a contract of employment for an indefinite time\n\nis terminable  at the  will of  either party.\"   Libby v.  Calais\n                                                                 \n\nRegional  Hospital,  554 A.2d  1181, 1182  (Me. 1989).   However,\n                  \n\nparties  may restrict  the  employer's ability  to terminate  the\n\n                               -3-\n\nemployment contract  to occasions when \"cause\"  exists by clearly\n\nand expressly stating that intention.  Id.  That intention can be\n                                         \n\nexpressed  in an employment  manual.  Id. at  1183.  However, the\n                                        \n\nmanual must  use  clear  and express  language  to  restrict  the\n\nemployer's  ability to discharge employees.   Id.   Language in a\n                                                \n\nmanual  merely implying a \"for cause\" limitation will not bind an\n\nemployer.  Id.  \n             \n\n          There are two relevant sections in the employee manual.\n\nSection 1(a) reads:\n\n            Merit   System.      The  employment   of\n                          \n            personnel and all actions effecting (sic)\n            employees shall be based solely on merit,\n            ability (performance), and justice.\n\nSection 7(b) reads:\n\n            Dismissals.    An  employee who  provides\n                      \n            unsatisfactory service or  who is  guilty\n            of   substantial   (sic)   violation   of\n            regulations shall be subject to dismissal\n            without prior notice.  In such cases, the\n            employee   shall  have  the  right  to  a\n            hearing  before  the Executive  Director.\n            The  employee may appeal  the decision of\n            the  Executive  Director to  the existing\n            Personnel Committee.\n\n          Appellee argues that the SPHA manual does not provide a\n\nclear  and specific  restriction  on termination  as required  by\n\nLibby.   Appellee apparently takes  the position that  the manual\n     \n\nwould have to specifically use the words  \"for cause\" in order to\n\nlimit an  employer's ability to terminate  employees to occasions\n\nwhere cause exists.   However,  Maine law does  not support  that\n\nposition.  \n\n          In Durepos v. Town of Van Buren, 516 A.2d 565, 566 (Me.\n                                         \n\n                               -4-\n\n1986),  the Maine  Supreme Court stated  that \"[t]he  phrase 'for\n\ncause' . . .  refers to conduct affecting the ability and fitness\n\nof  the employee to  perform his  duties.\"   Thus, language  in a\n\nmanual that permits dismissal based only on an employee's ability\n\nto do his job constitutes a \"for cause\" limitation.  \n\n          Similarly,   in  Lovejoy  v.  Grant  and  Maine  School\n                                                                 \n\nAdministrative District No. 37, 434 A.2d 45, 50 (1981), the Maine\n                              \n\nSupreme  Court found that Maine law provides that \"certain public\n\nschool teachers may  be discharged  only for cause.\"   The  court\n\nbased its  conclusion on a statute entitling  tenured teachers to\n\nsubstantive and procedural protections from non-renewal  of their\n\ncontracts  and a  statute  permitting the  dismissal of  unfit or\n\nunprofitable teachers.  Id.\n                          \n\n          Against  the  backdrop  of these  precedents,  the SPHA\n\nemployment  manual  clearly  restricts   the  SPHA's  ability  to\n\nterminate  employees.   It specifically  states that  all actions\n                                                         \n\naffecting  employees   will  be  based  on   merit  and  ability.\n\nAccordingly, the SPHA manual created a constitutionally protected\n\nproperty interest in appellant's  continued employment.  Thus, we\n\nreverse  the   district  court's   judgment  and  remand   for  a\n\ndetermination of  whether appellant  received due process  in his\n\ndismissal.\n\nII.  State Law Claims\n\n          Because appellant has stated a federal cause of action,\n\nwe reverse the dismissal of the state law  claims and remand them\n\nto  the   district  court  to   determine  whether   supplemental\n\n                               -5-\n\njurisdiction is appropriate.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n                               \n\n                               -6-\n",

An  employee who  provides\n                      \n            unsatisfactory service or  who is  guilty\n            of   substantial   (sic)   violation   of\n            regulations shall be subject to dismissal\n            without prior notice.  In such cases, the\n            employee   shall  have  the  right  to  a\n            hearing  before  the Executive  Director.\n            The  employee may appeal  the decision of\n            the  Executive  Director to  the existing\n            Personnel Committee.\n\n          Appellee argues that the SPHA manual does not provide a\n\nclear  and specific  restriction  on termination  as required  by\n\nLibby.   Appellee apparently takes  the position that  the manual\n     \n\nwould have to specifically use the words  \"for cause\" in order to\n\nlimit an  employer's ability to terminate  employees to occasions\n\nwhere cause exists.   However,  Maine law does  not support  that\n\nposition.  \n\n          In Durepos v. Town of Van Buren, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2064534\"><a href=\"/opinion/2064534/durepos-v-town-of-van-buren/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566 (Me.\n                                         \n\n                               -4-\n\n1986),  the Maine  Supreme Court stated  that \"[t]he  phrase 'for\n\ncause' . . .  refers to conduct affecting the ability and fitness\n\nof  the employee to  perform his  duties.\"   Thus, language  in a\n\nmanual that permits dismissal based only on an employee's ability\n\nto do his job constitutes a \"for cause\" limitation.  \n\n          Similarly,   in  Lovejoy  v.  Grant  and  Maine  School\n                                                                 \n\nAdministrative District No. 37, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1502947\"><a href=\"/opinion/1502947/lovejoy-v-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50 (1981), the Maine\n                              \n\nSupreme  Court found that Maine law provides that \"certain public\n\nschool teachers may  be discharged  only for cause.\"   The  court\n\nbased its  conclusion on a statute entitling  tenured teachers to\n\nsubstantive and procedural protections from non-renewal  of their\n\ncontracts  and a  statute  permitting the  dismissal of  unfit or\n\nunprofitable teachers.  Id.\n                          \n\n          Against  the  backdrop  of these  precedents,  the SPHA\n\nemployment  manual  clearly  restricts   the  SPHA's  ability  to\n\nterminate  employees.   It specifically  states that  all actions\n                                                         \n\naffecting  employees   will  be  based  on   merit  and  ability.\n\nAccordingly, the SPHA manual created a constitutionally protected\n\nproperty interest in appellant's  continued employment.  Thus, we\n\nreverse  the   district  court's   judgment  and  remand   for  a\n\ndetermination of  whether appellant  received due process  in his\n\ndismissal.\n\nII.  State Law Claims\n\n          Because appellant has stated a federal cause of action,\n\nwe reverse the dismissal of the state law  claims and remand them\n\nto  the   district  court  to   determine  whether   supplemental\n\n                               -5-\n\njurisdiction is appropriate.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n                               \n\n                               -6-\n</pre>",
