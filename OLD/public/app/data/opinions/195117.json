Batiste on brief pro se.\n                \nScott  Harshbarger,  Attorney  General,  and  William  J.   Meade,\n                                                                 \nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for respondent.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per  Curiam.     Petitioner  was  convicted   in  Boston\n                \n\nMunicipal  Court in  1989 on  a single  count of  assault and\n\nbattery with a  dangerous weapon.  He received  a sentence of\n\ntwo and one-half years, with all but one year suspended.  His\n\nensuing  attempts to challenge this conviction in state court\n\ncame  to naught:  the trial  court  denied a  motion for  new\n\ntrial, the  Appeals Court  affirmed his  conviction, and  the\n\nSupreme  Judicial Court  denied his  application for  further\n\nappellate review.   Petitioner then turned to  federal court,\n\nfiling a pro se, in forma pauperis petition for habeas corpus\n                                  \n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2254 in August 1991.  It was apparent\n\nfrom the face of the petition that, of the eight grounds  for\n\nrelief there raised,  no more than six had  been presented to\n\nthe  state appellate courts.  For  this reason, a magistrate-\n\njudge  (upon reviewing  the  petition  prior  to  service  of\n\nprocess)  recommended  that  it  be summarily  dismissed  for\n\nfailure to exhaust state remedies.  See, e.g., Rose v. Lundy,\n                                                            \n\n455  U.S.   509  (1982)  (requiring   dismissal  of   \"mixed\"\n\npetitions).\n\n     Petitioner responded to this recommendation in two ways.\n\nOn July  29, 1992,  he  filed objections  to the  magistrate-\n\njudge's  report, complaining  inter alia  of various  alleged\n                                        \n\nfactual inaccuracies therein.   Part of the  relief requested\n\nwas  that he be granted leave to  \"refile\" his petition.  Two\n\ndays  later, he did just that--submitting an amended petition\n\ncontaining  only the six \"exhausted\" claims for relief.  This\n\namended petition  was filed under  the same docket  number as\n\nits  predecessor.  The district court subsequently entered an\n\norder summarily  dismissing the petition  \"[f]or the  reasons\n\nstated   by  the  Magistrate   Judge  in  her   Findings  and\n\nRecommendations.\"   It  thereafter granted  a  certificate of\n\nprobable cause to appeal.\n\n     We  are constrained  to vacate  and  remand for  further\n\nproceedings, for the simple reason that  the court appears to\n\nhave overlooked  petitioner's  amended petition.    A  habeas\n\npetitioner,  faced with  a  determination that  his  petition\n\ncontains  both  exhausted and  unexhausted  claims, has  \"the\n\nchoice of returning  to state court to exhaust  his claims or\n\nof  amending or resubmitting  the habeas petition  to present\n\nonly exhausted claims to the district court.\"  Rose, 455 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 510; accord, e.g., Watkins v.  Ponte, 987 F.2d 27, 30 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir.  1993); Tart  v. Massachusetts,  949 F.2d 490,  494 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir.  1991).   The  petitioner  here has  plainly  chosen the\n\nlatter option--even  to the  point of  acknowledging (in  his\n\nappellate papers) that he will likely thereby waive his right\n\nto federal  review of his  two remaining claims.   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nMcCleskey v.  Zant, 499  U.S. 467 (1991);  Rose, 455  U.S. at\n                                               \n\n520-21 (plurality).\n\n     The government  contends  that the  order  of  dismissal\n\nconcerned  only the first  petition, that the  district court\n\n                             -3-\n\nhas taken  no  action with  regard  to the  amended  petition\n\n(i.e.,  that such petition  remains pending below),  and that\n\nany  issues involving  the  amended  petition  are  thus  not\n\nproperly before us.  Indeed, it goes so far as to  suggest we\n\nshould not \"tolerate\" petitioner's \"tactic\" of simultaneously\n\npropounding an amended  petition while seeking review  of the\n\ndismissal of  his initial petition.  See Brief  at 9 n.5.  We\n                                        \n\nfind  this  argument  utterly  unpersuasive.     Petitioner's\n\nunilateral  decision  to  amend his  petition  to  delete the\n\nunexhausted claims was consistent not only with the procedure\n\nprescribed in Rose,  but with Fed. R.  Civ. P. 15(a) as  well\n                  \n\n(since no responsive  pleading had been  filed).  See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nLacy v  Gabriel, 732  F.2d 7, 11  &amp; n.1  (1st Cir.)  (Rule 15\n               \n\napplies to    2254 proceedings),  cert. denied, 469  U.S. 861\n                                              \n\n(1984).  The  fact that the amended petition  appears to have\n\nbeen  submitted  beyond  the deadline  for  objecting  to the\n\nmagistrate-judge's report  is thus of no moment.  Having been\n\nproperly filed, the amended  petition \"completely replac[ed]\"\n\nthe  original petition, Cicchetti v. Lucey, 514 F.2d 362, 365\n                                          \n\nn.5  (1st Cir.  1975), with  the result  that the  latter \"no\n\nlonger perform[ed] any function in the case,\" 6 C. Wright, A.\n\nMiller &amp; M.  Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure    1476, at\n                                                 \n\n556-57 (1990).   Accord, e.g., Davis v. TXO  Prod. Corp., 929\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1515, 1517  (10th Cir. 1991);  Boelens v. Redman  Homes,\n                                                             \n\nInc.,  759  F.2d  504,  508  (5th  Cir.  1985)  (\"an  amended\n    \n\n                             -4-\n\ncomplaint ordinarily  supersedes the original and  renders it\n\nof no legal effect, unless the amended complaint specifically\n\nrefers to or adopts the earlier pleading\").\n\n     Against this backdrop, the contention that the  district\n\ncourt  confined its dismissal to the original petition, while\n\nleaving the amended  petition pending, is unconvincing.   The\n\nlanguage of  the  order contained  no such  suggestion.   The\n\ndocket sheet reflects that, on the very day the order issued,\n\nthe case was  declared \"closed.\"   And, if it were  true that\n\nthe amended petition remained pending, the order of dismissal\n\nwould quite  obviously not have  been appealable--an obstacle\n\nthat neither the  district court (in granting a  CPC) nor the\n\ngovernment on appeal  has mentioned.  We  must conclude that,\n\nin approving the magistrate-judge's recommendation of summary\n\ndismissal, the  district court  inadvertently overlooked  the\n\namended petition.  We therefore remand the matter for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n     Vacated and remanded for further proceedings.\n                                                 \n\n                             -5-\n",

Gabriel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433874\"><a href=\"/opinion/433874/leonard-lacy-v-harold-f-gabriel/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 11 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.)  (Rule 15 applies to Sec. 2254 proceedings), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">861</span></span> (1984).  The fact that the amended petition appears to have been submitted beyond the deadline for objecting to the magistrate-judge's report is thus of no moment.  Having been properly filed, the amended petition \"completely replac[ed]\" the original petition,  Cicchetti v. Lucey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"326902\"><a href=\"/opinion/326902/john-b-cicchetti-v-david-j-lucey-registrar-of-motor-vehicles/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 365 n. 5 (1st Cir. 1975), with the result that the latter \"no longer perform[ed] any function in the case,\" 6 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 1476, at 556-57 (1990).   Accord, e.g., Davis v. TXO Prod.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558678\"><a href=\"/opinion/558678/william-h-davis-v-txo-production-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1515</span></a></span>, 1517 (10th Cir. 1991);  Boelens v. Redman Homes, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450606\"><a href=\"/opinion/450606/sue-boelens-individually-and-as-next-friend-of-julie-boelens-and-jennifer/\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 508 (5th Cir. 1985) (\"an amended complaint ordinarily supersedes the original and renders it of no legal effect, unless the amended complaint specifically refers to or adopts the earlier pleading\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the contention that the district court confined its dismissal to the original petition, while leaving the amended petition pending, is unconvincing.  The language of the order contained no such suggestion.  The docket sheet reflects that, on the very day the order issued, the case was declared \"closed.\"  And, if it were true that the amended petition remained pending, the order of dismissal would quite obviously not have been appealable-an obstacle that neither the district court (in granting a CPC) nor the government on appeal has mentioned.  We must conclude that, in approving the magistrate-judge's recommendation of summary dismissal, the district court inadvertently overlooked the amended petition.  We therefore remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
