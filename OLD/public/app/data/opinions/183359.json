Watt, Jr. on brief for petitioners.\n     Tony West, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nJennifer Paisner-Williams, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, and Yedidya Cohen, Trial Attorney, Office\nof Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          January 24, 2011\n\f               SELYA, Circuit Judge.         The lead petitioner, Ya Ya Deen\n\nMariko, and the derivative petitioner, Tiranke Kaba, are husband\n\nand wife.1         Both of them are Guinean nationals.       They seek review\n\nof a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which\n\naffirmed       a    decision    of    an   immigration   judge   (IJ)   denying\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT).         They also seek review of the BIA's denial of their\n\nmotion to remand.         Discerning no cognizable error, we reject the\n\npetition.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n               The facts are straightforward. Mariko entered the United\n\nStates in late 2001, thus reuniting with Kaba, who had entered more\n\nthan a year earlier.           Both petitioners were here illegally and, in\n\n2004,    the       Department    of   Homeland   Security   initiated   removal\n\nproceedings.         See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), (7)(A)(i)(I).        The\n\npetitioners conceded removability but cross-applied for withholding\n\nof removal and protection under the CAT.\n\n\n     1\n       We use the terms \"lead\" and \"derivative\" because, in his\napplication, Mariko described Kaba as a derivative beneficiary of\nhis claims for relief.     The petitioners' brief continues this\nusage. We note, however, that Mariko only applied for withholding\nof removal and protection under the United Nations Convention\nAgainst Torture (CAT).       The statutory provision that the\npetitioners cite, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A), allows for derivative\nstatus only when the lead petitioner applies for asylum.       The\nregulations concerning withholding of removal and CAT protection\nmake no allowance for derivative claims.           See 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1208.16(b), (c).     Accordingly, derivative claims cannot be\nprosecuted for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT.\nSee Warui v. Holder, 577 F.3d 55, 58 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                           -2-\n\f          The IJ convened a hearing on April 17, 2007. Mariko, the\n\nonly live witness, claimed that he feared persecution in his\n\nhomeland on account of his membership in the Guinea People's Rally\n\n(RPG), a political party that opposed the party in power.                  He\n\nprofessed himself to have been the RPG's \"secretary for youth . . .\n\nsomething like that,\" whose duties included recruiting new members,\n\ncampaigning, giving speeches, and working with young people. These\n\nactivities, he testified, led him into harm's way.\n\n          Mariko    recounted    that,    on   November   11,   2001,   armed\n\nsoldiers broke up an RPG meeting and arrested him along with other\n\nparty members.    He was beaten, brought to a military camp, placed\n\nin a cell, and detained for approximately 19 days.              His captors\n\naccused him of trying to overthrow the government and tortured him\n\nrepeatedly.      As a result of these beatings, Mariko sustained\n\ninjuries \"everywhere\" from his neck to his waist and bled profusely\n\nfrom \"tears\" on his body.       In addition, his thumb was permanently\n\ndamaged (though he could not remember when or how this occurred).\n\n          Mariko eventually escaped from the camp and made his way\n\nto a friend's house.      He later purchased a phony passport and\n\ntraveled to France.    Once there, he purchased a second passport,\n\nused it fraudulently to fly to Chicago, and then journeyed to Rhode\n\nIsland to join his wife.\n\n          Under cross-examination, Mariko said that he possesses a\n\nbirth certificate, Guinean passport, and national identification\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcard.    He told the IJ that his brother (who still lived in Guinea)\n\nhad procured these documents and mailed them to him in 2004 or\n\n2005.    He conceded that, when he received his identification card,\n\nit bore both a signature and a fingerprint.    Since the petitioner\n\nhad not been in Guinea since 2001, the signature and fingerprint\n\nwere necessarily bogus.    Mariko further admitted that his passport\n\nmay have been obtained fraudulently.\n\n            To support his claim of mistreatment while in Guinea,\n\nMariko had introduced into evidence a summary of his medical\n\nrecords.     On cross-examination, he was unable to explain why his\n\nmedical records reflected injuries only to his thumb and ring\n\nfinger.    He was equally at a loss to explain how this jibed with\n\nhis assertion that he was \"wounded everywhere.\"    His claim that he\n\nhad received the summary document by mail in either 2002 or 2003\n\nwas suspect on its face; the medical records bore a date of June 6,\n\n2006.\n\n            Mariko's grasp of the politics of his homeland seemed\n\nshaky.     Though he correctly identified the leader of the RPG, he\n\nevaded direct questions about significant events in the annals of\n\nthe party. In a similar vein, he failed to explain inconsistencies\n\nbetween his testimony and his earlier affidavit in support of his\n\napplication for relief, including inconsistencies regarding the\n\nfrequency of the torture that he had endured.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f              Faced with this scumbled record, the IJ denied the\n\napplication for withholding of removal and protection under the\n\nCAT.      The    cornerstone       of    the    IJ's    decision      was   an   adverse\n\ncredibility determination.              Once Mariko's testimony was discounted\n\non that basis, what remained was insufficient to sustain the\n\npetitioners' devoir of persuasion on their claims for relief.\n\n              The petitioners appealed to the BIA, challenging the\n\nadverse credibility determination.                   They argued that the IJ (i)\n\nerroneously concluded that Mariko's testimony lacked sufficient\n\ndetail;    (ii)       ascribed    too     much       weight    to    Mariko's    use   of\n\nquestionable documents; and (iii) relied too heavily on Mariko's\n\ninability to specify the date when he received the medical records.\n\n              On December 1, 2008 — while their appeal to the BIA was\n\npending — the petitioners filed a motion to remand. They theorized\n\nthat   Kaba     was    newly     eligible      for    asylum    based    upon    changed\n\ncircumstances.           In support, they cited (i) the birth of their\n\ndaughter,       Su-ad,    on   September       17,    2008,    and   (ii)   an   opinion\n\nrecently issued by the Attorney General in an unrelated case.                          In\n\nan order dated March 10, 2009, the BIA adopted and affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision and simultaneously denied the motion to remand. With\n\nrespect to the latter, the BIA noted that Kaba had premised her new\n\nasylum claim solely on a fear that her newborn daughter probably\n\nwould fall victim to female genital mutilation (FGM) in Guinea.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fSuch a claim, the BIA concluded, was inadequate on its face.        This\n\ntimely petition for judicial review followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           On a petition for judicial review, we typically direct\n\nour appraisal to the final orders of the BIA.     Seng v. Holder, 584\n\nF.3d 13, 17 (1st Cir. 2009).     But where \"the BIA has adopted the\n\nIJ's decision in whole or in part, we review the pertinent portions\n\nof the IJ's decision as well.\"    Rivas-Mira v. Holder, 556 F.3d 1,\n\n4 (1st Cir. 2009).   This is such a case.\n\n           In conducting this review, we examine findings of fact\n\n(including    credibility   determinations)   under   the    substantial\n\nevidence standard.    López-Castro v. Holder, 577 F.3d 49, 52 (1st\n\nCir. 2009); Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThis standard requires us to defer to the agency's findings as long\n\nas they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\"              Nikijuluw v.\n\nGonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting INS v. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).     Absent an error of law, we\n\nwill reverse only if the record compels a conclusion contrary to\n\nthat reached by the agency.2    Chhay v. Mukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).\n\n\n\n      2\n       Abstract legal determinations are afforded de novo review,\nsubject to some measure of deference to the agency's interpretation\nof statutes and regulations that fall within its ambit. See Seng,\n584 F.3d at 17. This review modality is not implicated here.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f                           A.    Adjudicated Claims.\n\n           We begin with the adjudicated claims for withholding of\n\nremoval and protection under the CAT.\n\n           1.      Withholding      of   Removal.     A     well-defined    legal\n\nframework governs applications for withholding of removal.                    The\n\napplicant must show that, independent of any presumption, there is\n\na clear probability that he will be subjected to persecution on\n\naccount of a statutorily protected ground upon repatriation.                  See\n\nLópez-Castro, 577 F.3d at 52; Chhay, 540 F.3d at 6.                    For this\n\npurpose,   there    are    five   statutorily     protected    grounds:     race,\n\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and\n\npolitical opinion.        8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).\n\n           In the case at hand, Mariko alleges persecution on\n\naccount of his political opinion, as manifested by his membership\n\nin the RPG.     This is a statutorily protected ground.            Building on\n\nthat foundation, he rehearses the persecution that he claims to\n\nhave suffered in the past, asserts that the same regime remains in\n\npower, and voices his fear of being harmed upon his return to\n\nGuinea.    The IJ and the BIA rejected this claim primarily because\n\nof   doubts     about   the     veracity   of    Mariko's    account   of    past\n\npersecution.\n\n           Before       turning     to     the    supportability       of    this\n\ndetermination, we pause to make an important temporal point.\n\nMariko filed his application for relief after May 11, 2005.                 Thus,\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fhis case is controlled by the credibility standard embedded in the\n\nREAL ID Act of 2005.      Pub. L. No. 109-13, § 101(a)(3), 119 Stat.\n\n302, 303 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii)).           In gauging\n\ncredibility under that standard, an IJ is directed to consider the\n\n\"totality    of   the   circumstances,   and   all   relevant       factors,\"\n\nincluding but not limited to the alien's demeanor, responsiveness,\n\nand prior statements.        Id.   The IJ may also consider, where\n\nrelevant, the plausibility of the alien's story and the presence or\n\nabsence     of    corroborative     evidence.          See      8      U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).       If the IJ reasonably deems the alien's\n\ntestimony \"speculative or unworthy of credence,\" that testimony may\n\nbe either discounted or disregarded entirely. Rivas-Mira, 556 F.3d\n\nat 4 (quoting Bebri v. Mukasey, 545 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir. 2008)).\n\n            In denying withholding of removal, the IJ concluded that\n\nMariko's tale was not believable.        Mariko strives to persuade us\n\nthat this adverse credibility determination was not predicated on\n\nsubstantial evidence.     We are not convinced.\n\n            The IJ's determination was based on a series of specific\n\nfindings.   First, the IJ concluded that Mariko's use of fraudulent\n\nidentification documents undermined his credibility.         The factual\n\npremise on which this conclusion rests is rock-solid: Mariko\n\nadmitted, in effect, that his identity card bore a signature and a\n\nfingerprint that did not belong to him.        He also conceded that he\n\nhad used fraudulent passports in the course of his journey to the\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fUnited States and that the passport currently in his possession\n\nmight be fraudulent.          Though there may be valid reasons for an\n\némigré    to    make    use   of   fraudulent   documents    to   escape   from\n\npersecution, this case bears no such hallmark.              After all, Mariko\n\nobtained a third fraudulent passport and the bogus identification\n\ncard after he was safely within the United States.                Moreover, he\n\ntestified that his motivation behind obtaining these documents was\n\nthat he \"got the lottery\" and \"wanted to get some documents from\n\n[his] country.\"         On this record, the IJ was entitled to draw an\n\ninference of untrustworthiness from this serial use of fraudulent\n\ndocumentation.         See Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 22 n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n               A second data point to which the IJ adverted concerned\n\nthe inconsistencies between Mariko's words and the medical records.\n\nIn his testimony, Mariko alleged that soldiers had subjected him to\n\nfull-body beatings and caused numerous \"tears\" in his skin.                 But\n\nthe medical records noted only a hand injury.               Mariko was unable\n\neither to explain this discrepancy or to pin down the time when the\n\nmedical records were generated.\n\n               Third, the IJ found Mariko's professed relationship to\n\nthe RPG to be \"vague\" and his testimony on this point lacking in\n\ndetail.    As an example, the IJ noted Mariko's inability to define\n\nhis role in the organization.          We view these findings as part and\n\nparcel of the IJ's global finding that Mariko's demeanor was\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fdisconcerting (and, thus, suggestive of untruthfulness).                              In this\n\nregard, the IJ noted that the pace of Mariko's testimony \"slowed\n\nperceptibly\" when he was asked about his potential involvement.\n\n            Finally, the IJ found significant inconsistencies between\n\nthe affidavit that Mariko submitted in support of his original\n\napplication      for    relief    and        his     hearing      testimony.             These\n\ninconsistencies        related    to    such       things    as   the      beatings,          his\n\ndetention, and his interrogation.                  For example, in his affidavit\n\nMariko vouchsafed that he was interrogated on each of the 19 days\n\nthat he was detained and beaten each time that he was interrogated.\n\nIn his testimony, however, he said that he was beaten only three to\n\nfive times during the entire 19-day span.\n\n            To    bolster    their       argument         that      the    IJ's       adverse\n\ncredibility      determination         was     not     supported          by     substantial\n\nevidence, the petitioners attempt to trivialize the individual\n\nfailings and inconsistencies catalogued by the IJ.                             But the whole\n\nsometimes can exceed the sum of the parts, and the appropriate test\n\nfocuses on the totality of the circumstances.                       The IJ's findings,\n\nin   cumulation,       constitute      substantial        evidence.             See     Pan    v.\n\nGonzales,   489    F.3d     80,   86    (1st       Cir.     2007)    (\"Some        of    these\n\ninconsistencies, in isolation, may seem like small potatoes.                              What\n\ncounts, however, is that their cumulative effect is great.\").                                 The\n\nrecord evidence is not such as to compel a reasonable factfinder to\n\nmake a contrary determination and, thus, the IJ's assessment of\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fMariko's credibility deserves our approbation.                   See Da Silva, 394\n\nF.3d at 4-5; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).                         Given that\n\nsupportable determination, it follows inexorably that the BIA's\n\ndenial of Mariko's application for withholding of removal must be\n\nupheld.\n\n            2. Protection under the CAT. This leaves Mariko's claim\n\nfor protection under the CAT.            To succeed on this claim Mariko had\n\nto prove that, more likely than not, he would be tortured if\n\ndeported to his homeland.          See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); see also\n\nAhmed v. Holder, 611 F.3d 90, 97-98 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n            On    the   facts     of    this    case,   Mariko's    CAT   claim    is\n\ninextricably intertwined with his withholding of removal claim.\n\nThus, what we have said about the supportability of the adverse\n\ncredibility determination dooms Mariko's claim for CAT protection\n\njust as surely as it doomed his claim for withholding of removal.\n\n                            B.    Motion to Remand.\n\n            The last leg of our journey tracks the BIA's denial of\n\nthe petitioners' motion.          The petitioners styled their motion as a\n\nmotion    \"to    remand.\"        This   nomenclature      does    not   affect    the\n\napplicable legal framework.             See Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 45,\n\n63-64 (1st Cir. 2006).          When, as in this case, an appealing alien\n\nhas filed a motion that seeks to have the BIA return an appealed\n\ncase to the IJ for further proceedings based on newly available\n\ninformation, that motion, however denominated, must satisfy the\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\frequirements      that    attend    a   motion     to   reopen.     See    Falae   v.\n\nGonzales, 411 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 2005); In re Coelho, 20 I. & N.\n\nDec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992).\n\n            The BIA may rely on any of three independent grounds in\n\ndenying a motion to reopen: failure to make out a prima facie case\n\nfor   the   relief   sought;       failure    to   identify   new   and    material\n\nevidence, previously unavailable; or, even if these requirements\n\nare met, failure to establish an entitlement to the discretionary\n\nrelief sought.       INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992).                  Here,\n\nthe BIA denied the petitioners' motion on the first ground.                        We\n\nreview this denial for abuse of discretion.                Fesseha v. Ashcroft,\n\n333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).             We will interfere with the BIA's\n\nexercise of discretion only if it appears that the BIA made \"an\n\nerror of law or acted in a manner that is fairly characterizable as\n\narbitrary or capricious.\"           Falae, 411 F.3d at 14.\n\n            The    motion    to    remand     asserted    that    Kaba    was   newly\n\neligible    to    apply    for    asylum     due   to   changed   circumstances.3\n\nPertinently, the term \"changed circumstances\" is a term of art. It\n\nmeans \"changes in the applicant's circumstances that materially\n\naffect the applicant's eligibility for asylum, including changes in\n\napplicable U.S. law and activities the applicant becomes involved\n\n\n\n      3\n       Originally, both Mariko and Kaba were time-barred from\npursuing asylum because each of them was in the United States for\nmore than a year before joining any application for relief. See 8\nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); Chhay, 540 F.3d at 4.\n\n                                        -12-\n\fin   outside   the   country   of   feared   persecution   that    place   the\n\napplicant at risk.\"      8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(B).           In support,\n\nthe petitioners cited two items: the birth of their daughter, Su-\n\nad, on September 17, 2008,4 and the Attorney General's opinion in\n\nMatter of A-T, 24 I. & N. Dec. 617 (A.G. 2008).            We examine each\n\nitem.\n\n           The petitioners' claim that Su-ad's birth constituted a\n\nmaterial change in circumstances rests on an allegation that both\n\nKaba and her older daughter had been subjected to FGM in Guinea.\n\nThe petitioners maintained that, for this reason, they feared that\n\nSu-ad would suffer the same fate if the family returned to that\n\ncountry.\n\n           The BIA rejected this proposition, relying on its own\n\nprecedent as well as jurisprudence from this court.           In Matter of\n\nA-K, 24 I. & N. Dec. 275 (BIA 2007), the BIA concluded that a\n\nfather was not eligible for either asylum or withholding of removal\n\nbased on his claim that his United States citizen daughters would\n\nbe subjected to FGM in his homeland.         Id. at 277-78.\n\n           Matter of A-K is not an outlier.        We, too, have affirmed\n\nBIA decisions denying asylum based on potential persecution of\n\nfamily members.      Thus, in Kechichian v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 15 (1st\n\nCir. 2008), we held that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in\n\n\n      4\n       Because Su-ad was born in the United States, she — unlike\nher parents — is a United States citizen. See United States v.\nWong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649, 702 (1898).\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdenying a motion to reopen based on the potential persecution of\n\nthe alien's son.     Id. at 22.      The same principle anchored our\n\ndecision in Burbiene v. Holder, 568 F.3d 251, 254 n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).\n\n            Those decisions are controlling here.       Although a child\n\nmay be a derivative beneficiary of a parent's claim for asylum, the\n\ngrounds for asylum must relate directly to the parent's situation.\n\nThere is no authority, either statutory or in the case law, that\n\nindicates   that   the   parent   may,   in   effect,   be   a   derivative\n\nbeneficiary of her child's asylum claim.        The BIA was, therefore,\n\nwarranted in refusing to reopen the case to allow Kaba to pursue a\n\ntheory on which she could not prevail.\n\n            We deal next with the petitioners' asseveration that\n\nMatter of A-T represented a \"change[] in applicable U.S. law,\"\n\nwhich entitles Kaba to asylum.      This asseveration lacks force.\n\n            In Matter of A-T, the Attorney General vacated the BIA's\n\ndenial of an adult woman's application for withholding of removal.\n\n24 I. & N. Dec. at 617-18.    The Attorney General concluded that the\n\nagency had erred in finding that, because FGM \"cannot occur more\n\nthan once\" to any one person, the application had to be denied on\n\nthe ground that the feared future persecution could not \"take\n\nprecisely the same form as past persecution.\"           Id. at 621.    The\n\nAttorney General instructed the BIA, on remand, to determine\n\nwhether the fact that the alien had been subjected to FGM in the\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fpast triggered a presumption of a continuing threat to her life or\n\nfreedom on account of her membership in a particular social group\n\n(presumably women who had been subjected to FGM).             Id. at 623; see\n\nalso 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i).\n\n           This opinion does not help the petitioners.            While Kaba\n\nhad undergone FGM as a child in Guinea, her claim of eligibility\n\nfor asylum was not based either on her plight or on her membership\n\nin a class of females who had been similarly brutalized.             Rather,\n\nKaba premised her claim on a fear that her daughter would be\n\nsubjected to FGM if she were relocated to Guinea.              Matter of A-T\n\nis, therefore, not on point.\n\n           In    an   effort   to   detour    around   this   reasoning,    the\n\npetitioners suggest in this court, for the first time, that Kaba\n\nherself harbors a well-founded fear of future persecution based on\n\nher childhood experience with FGM.           This suggestion comes too late\n\nin the day.     A petitioner must exhaust her administrative remedies\n\nby presenting each of her claims face up and squarely to the\n\nagency.   See Chhay, 540 F.3d at 5-6.         This court cannot consider an\n\nunexhausted claim on a petition for judicial review.            See id.    This\n\nrestraint is consistent with the statutory directive that statutory\n\nauthority allows review of a final removal order only after \"the\n\nalien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the\n\nalien as of right.\"       8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1); see also Makoul v.\n\nAshcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004) (explaining that theories\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fnot seasonably advanced before the BIA cannot be presented for the\n\nfirst time in the court of appeals).\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe deny the petition for judicial review in all of its particulars.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

Watt, Jr. on brief for petitioners.</p>\n<p>Tony West, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, Jennifer Paisner-Williams, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration Litigation, and Yedidya Cohen, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LIPEZ, SELYA and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The lead petitioner, Ya Ya Deen Mariko, and the derivative petitioner, Tiranke Kaba, are husband and wife.<sup>[1]</sup> Both of them are Guinean nationals. They seek review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which affirmed a decision of an immigration judge (IJ) denying withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). They also seek review of the BIA's denial of their motion to remand. Discerning no cognizable error, we reject the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The facts are straightforward. Mariko entered the United States in late 2001, thus reuniting with Kaba, who had entered more than a year earlier. Both petitioners were here illegally and, in 2004, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), (7)(A)(i)(I). The petitioners conceded removability but cross-applied for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>The IJ convened a hearing on April 17, 2007. Mariko, the only live witness, claimed that he feared persecution in his homeland on account of his membership in the Guinea People's Rally (RPG), a political party that opposed the party in power. He professed himself to have been the RPG's \"secretary for youth . . . something like that,\" whose duties included recruiting new members, campaigning, giving <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> speeches, and working with young people. These activities, he testified, led him into harm's way.</p>\n<p>Mariko recounted that, on November 11, 2001, armed soldiers broke up an RPG meeting and arrested him along with other party members. He was beaten, brought to a military camp, placed in a cell, and detained for approximately 19 days. His captors accused him of trying to overthrow the government and tortured him repeatedly. As a result of these beatings, Mariko sustained injuries \"everywhere\" from his neck to his waist and bled profusely from \"tears\" on his body. In addition, his thumb was permanently damaged (though he could not remember when or how this occurred).</p>\n<p>Mariko eventually escaped from the camp and made his way to a friend's house. He later purchased a phony passport and traveled to France. Once there, he purchased a second passport, used it fraudulently to fly to Chicago, and then journeyed to Rhode Island to join his wife.</p>\n<p>Under cross-examination, Mariko said that he possesses a birth certificate, Guinean passport, and national identification card. He told the IJ that his brother (who still lived in Guinea) had procured these documents and mailed them to him in 2004 or 2005. He conceded that, when he received his identification card, it bore both a signature and a fingerprint. Since the petitioner had not been in Guinea since 2001, the signature and fingerprint were necessarily bogus. Mariko further admitted that his passport may have been obtained fraudulently.</p>\n<p>To support his claim of mistreatment while in Guinea, Mariko had introduced into evidence a summary of his medical records. On cross-examination, he was unable to explain why his medical records reflected injuries only to his thumb and ring finger. He was equally at a loss to explain how this jibed with his assertion that he was \"wounded everywhere.\" His claim that he had received the summary document by mail in either 2002 or 2003 was suspect on its face; the medical records bore a date of June 6, 2006.</p>\n<p>Mariko's grasp of the politics of his homeland seemed shaky. Though he correctly identified the leader of the RPG, he evaded direct questions about significant events in the annals of the party. In a similar vein, he failed to explain inconsistencies between his testimony and his earlier affidavit in support of his application for relief, including inconsistencies regarding the frequency of the torture that he had endured.</p>\n<p>Faced with this scumbled record, the IJ denied the application for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. The cornerstone of the IJ's decision was an adverse credibility determination. Once Mariko's testimony was discounted on that basis, what remained was insufficient to sustain the petitioners' devoir of persuasion on their claims for relief.</p>\n<p>The petitioners appealed to the BIA, challenging the adverse credibility determination. They argued that the IJ (i) erroneously concluded that Mariko's testimony lacked sufficient detail; (ii) ascribed too much weight to Mariko's use of questionable documents; and (iii) relied too heavily on Mariko's inability to specify the date when he received the medical records.</p>\n<p>On December 1, 2008while their appeal to the BIA was pendingthe petitioners filed a motion to remand. They theorized that Kaba was newly eligible for asylum based upon changed circumstances. In support, they cited (i) the birth of their daughter, Su-ad, on September 17, 2008, and (ii) an opinion recently issued by the Attorney General in an unrelated case. In an order dated March 10, 2009, the BIA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision and simultaneously denied the motion to remand. With respect to the latter, the BIA noted that Kaba had premised her new asylum claim solely on a fear that her newborn daughter probably would fall victim to female genital mutilation (FGM) in Guinea. Such a claim, the BIA concluded, was inadequate on its face. This timely petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>On a petition for judicial review, we typically direct our appraisal to the final orders of the BIA. <i>Seng v. Holder,</i> 584 F.3d 13, 17 (1st Cir.2009). But where \"the BIA has adopted the IJ's decision in whole or in part, we review the pertinent portions of the IJ's decision as well.\" <i>Rivas-Mira v. Holder,</i> 556 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2009). This is such a case.</p>\n<p>In conducting this review, we examine findings of fact (including credibility determinations) under the substantial evidence standard. <i>López-Castro v. Holder,</i> 577 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005). This standard requires us to defer to the agency's findings as long as they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Absent an error of law, we will reverse only if the record compels a conclusion contrary to that reached by the agency.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> 540 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Adjudicated Claims.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We begin with the adjudicated claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Withholding of Removal.</i> A well-defined legal framework governs applications for withholding of removal. The applicant must show that, independent of any presumption, there is a clear probability that he will be subjected to persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground upon repatriation. <i>See </i><i>López-Castro,</i> 577 F.3d at 52; <i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 6. For this purpose, there are five statutorily protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, Mariko alleges persecution on account of his political opinion, as manifested by his membership in the RPG. This is a statutorily protected ground. Building on that foundation, he rehearses the persecution that he claims to have suffered in the past, asserts that the same regime remains in power, and voices his fear of being harmed upon his return to Guinea. The IJ and the BIA rejected this claim primarily because of doubts about the veracity of Mariko's account of past persecution.</p>\n<p>Before turning to the supportability of this determination, we pause to make an important temporal point. Mariko filed his application for relief after May 11, 2005. Thus, his case is controlled by the credibility standard embedded in the REAL ID Act of 2005. Pub.L. No. 109-13, § 101(a)(3), 119 Stat. 302, 303 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii)). In gauging credibility under that standard, an IJ is directed to consider the \"totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors,\" including but not limited to the alien's demeanor, responsiveness, and prior statements. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> <i>Id.</i> The IJ may also consider, where relevant, the plausibility of the alien's story and the presence or absence of corroborative evidence. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). If the IJ reasonably deems the alien's testimony \"speculative or unworthy of credence,\" that testimony may be either discounted or disregarded entirely. <i>Rivas-Mira,</i> 556 F.3d at 4 (quoting <i>Bebri v. Mukasey,</i> 545 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p>In denying withholding of removal, the IJ concluded that Mariko's tale was not believable. Mariko strives to persuade us that this adverse credibility determination was not predicated on substantial evidence. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p>The IJ's determination was based on a series of specific findings. First, the IJ concluded that Mariko's use of fraudulent identification documents undermined his credibility. The factual premise on which this conclusion rests is rock-solid: Mariko admitted, in effect, that his identity card bore a signature and a fingerprint that did not belong to him. He also conceded that he had used fraudulent passports in the course of his journey to the United States and that the passport currently in his possession might be fraudulent. Though there may be valid reasons for an émigré to make use of fraudulent documents to escape from persecution, this case bears no such hallmark. After all, Mariko obtained a third fraudulent passport and the bogus identification card <i>after</i> he was safely within the United States. Moreover, he testified that his motivation behind obtaining these documents was that he \"got the lottery\" and \"wanted to get some documents from [his] country.\" On this record, the IJ was entitled to draw an inference of untrustworthiness from this serial use of fraudulent documentation. <i>See </i><i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> 411 F.3d 16, 22 n. 5 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>A second data point to which the IJ adverted concerned the inconsistencies between Mariko's words and the medical records. In his testimony, Mariko alleged that soldiers had subjected him to full-body beatings and caused numerous \"tears\" in his skin. But the medical records noted only a hand injury. Mariko was unable either to explain this discrepancy or to pin down the time when the medical records were generated.</p>\n<p>Third, the IJ found Mariko's professed relationship to the RPG to be \"vague\" and his testimony on this point lacking in detail. As an example, the IJ noted Mariko's inability to define his role in the organization. We view these findings as part and parcel of the IJ's global finding that Mariko's demeanor was disconcerting (and, thus, suggestive of untruthfulness). In this regard, the IJ noted that the pace of Mariko's testimony \"slowed perceptibly\" when he was asked about his potential involvement.</p>\n<p>Finally, the IJ found significant inconsistencies between the affidavit that Mariko submitted in support of his original application for relief and his hearing testimony. These inconsistencies related to such things as the beatings, his detention, and his interrogation. For example, in his affidavit Mariko vouchsafed that he was interrogated on each of the 19 days that he was detained and beaten each time that he was interrogated. In his testimony, however, he said that he was beaten only three to five times during the entire 19-day span.</p>\n<p>To bolster their argument that the IJ's adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, the petitioners attempt to trivialize the individual failings and inconsistencies catalogued by the IJ. But the whole sometimes can exceed the sum of the parts, and the appropriate test focuses on the totality of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> the circumstances. The IJ's findings, in cumulation, constitute substantial evidence. <i>See </i><i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> 489 F.3d 80, 86 (1st Cir.2007) (\"Some of these inconsistencies, in isolation, may seem like small potatoes. What counts, however, is that their cumulative effect is great.\"). The record evidence is not such as to compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination and, thus, the IJ's assessment of Mariko's credibility deserves our approbation. <i>See </i><i>Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 4-5; <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). Given that supportable determination, it follows inexorably that the BIA's denial of Mariko's application for withholding of removal must be upheld.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Protection under the CAT.</i> This leaves Mariko's claim for protection under the CAT. To succeed on this claim Mariko had to prove that, more likely than not, he would be tortured if deported to his homeland. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); <i>see also </i><i>Ahmed v. Holder,</i> 611 F.3d 90, 97-98 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>On the facts of this case, Mariko's CAT claim is inextricably intertwined with his withholding of removal claim. Thus, what we have said about the supportability of the adverse credibility determination dooms Mariko's claim for CAT protection just as surely as it doomed his claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Motion to Remand.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The last leg of our journey tracks the BIA's denial of the petitioners' motion. The petitioners styled their motion as a motion \"to remand.\" This nomenclature does not affect the applicable legal framework. <i>See </i><i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> 461 F.3d 45, 63-64 (1st Cir.2006). When, as in this case, an appealing alien has filed a motion that seeks to have the BIA return an appealed case to the IJ for further proceedings based on newly available information, that motion, however denominated, must satisfy the requirements that attend a motion to reopen. <i>See </i><i>Falae v. Gonzales,</i> 411 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir.2005); <i>In re Coelho,</i> 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992).</p>\n<p>The BIA may rely on any of three independent grounds in denying a motion to reopen: failure to make out a prima facie case for the relief sought; failure to identify new and material evidence, previously unavailable; or, even if these requirements are met, failure to establish an entitlement to the discretionary relief sought. <i>INS v. Doherty,</i> 502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Here, the BIA denied the petitioners' motion on the first ground. We review this denial for abuse of discretion. <i>Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir.2003). We will interfere with the BIA's exercise of discretion only if it appears that the BIA made \"an error of law or acted in a manner that is fairly characterizable as arbitrary or capricious.\" <i>Falae,</i> 411 F.3d at 14.</p>\n<p>The motion to remand asserted that Kaba was newly eligible to apply for asylum due to changed circumstances.<sup>[3]</sup> Pertinently, the term \"changed circumstances\" is a term of art. It means \"changes in the applicant's circumstances that materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum, including changes in applicable U.S. law and activities the applicant becomes involved in outside the country of feared persecution that place the applicant at risk.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(B). In support, the petitioners <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> cited two items: the birth of their daughter, Su-ad, on September 17, 2008,<sup>[4]</sup> and the Attorney General's opinion in <i>Matter of A-T-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 617 (A.G. 2008). We examine each item.</p>\n<p>The petitioners' claim that Su-ad's birth constituted a material change in circumstances rests on an allegation that both Kaba and her older daughter had been subjected to FGM in Guinea. The petitioners maintained that, for this reason, they feared that Su-ad would suffer the same fate if the family returned to that country.</p>\n<p>The BIA rejected this proposition, relying on its own precedent as well as jurisprudence from this court. In <i>Matter of A-K-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 275 (BIA 2007), the BIA concluded that a father was not eligible for either asylum or withholding of removal based on his claim that his United States citizen daughters would be subjected to FGM in his homeland. <i>Id.</i> at 277-78.</p>\n<p><i>Matter of A-K-</i> is not an outlier. We, too, have affirmed BIA decisions denying asylum based on potential persecution of family members. Thus, in <i>Kechichian v. Mukasey,</i> 535 F.3d 15 (1st Cir.2008), we held that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to reopen based on the potential persecution of the alien's son. <i>Id.</i> at 22. The same principle anchored our decision in <i>Burbiene v. Holder,</i> 568 F.3d 251, 254 n. 3 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Those decisions are controlling here. Although a child may be a derivative beneficiary of a parent's claim for asylum, the grounds for asylum must relate directly to the parent's situation. There is no authority, either statutory or in the case law, that indicates that the parent may, in effect, be a derivative beneficiary of her child's asylum claim. The BIA was, therefore, warranted in refusing to reopen the case to allow Kaba to pursue a theory on which she could not prevail.</p>\n<p>We deal next with the petitioners' asseveration that <i>Matter of A-T-</i> represented a \"change[] in applicable U.S. law,\" which entitles Kaba to asylum. This asseveration lacks force.</p>\n<p>In <i>Matter of A-T-,</i> the Attorney General vacated the BIA's denial of an adult woman's application for withholding of removal. 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 617-18. The Attorney General concluded that the agency had erred in finding that, because FGM \"cannot occur more than once\" to any one person, the application had to be denied on the ground that the feared future persecution could not \"take precisely the same form as past persecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 621. The Attorney General instructed the BIA, on remand, to determine whether the fact that the alien had been subjected to FGM in the past triggered a presumption of a continuing threat to her life or freedom on account of her membership in a particular social group (presumably women who had been subjected to FGM). <i>Id.</i> at 623; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i).</p>\n<p>This opinion does not help the petitioners. While Kaba had undergone FGM as a child in Guinea, her claim of eligibility for asylum was not based either on her plight or on her membership in a class of females who had been similarly brutalized. Rather, Kaba premised her claim on a fear that her daughter would be subjected to FGM if she were relocated to Guinea. <i>Matter of A-T-</i> is, therefore, not on point.</p>\n<p>In an effort to detour around this reasoning, the petitioners suggest in this court, for the first time, that Kaba herself <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> harbors a well-founded fear of future persecution based on her childhood experience with FGM. This suggestion comes too late in the day. A petitioner must exhaust her administrative remedies by presenting each of her claims face up and squarely to the agency. <i>See </i><i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 5-6.

The statutory provision that the petitioners cite, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A), allows for derivative status only when the lead petitioner applies for asylum. The regulations concerning withholding of removal and CAT protection make no allowance for derivative claims. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b), (c). Accordingly, derivative claims cannot be prosecuted for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT. <i>See </i><i>Warui v.

This review modality is not implicated here.</p>\n<p>[3]  Originally, both Mariko and Kaba were time-barred from pursuing asylum because each of them was in the United States for more than a year before joining any application for relief. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); <i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 4.</p>\n<p>[4]  Because Su-ad was born in the United States, sheunlike her parentsis a United States citizen. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

They seek review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which affirmed a decision of an immigration judge (IJ) denying withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). They also seek review of the BIA's denial of their motion to remand. Discerning no cognizable error, we reject the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The facts are straightforward. Mariko entered the United States in late 2001, thus reuniting with Kaba, who had entered more than a year earlier. Both petitioners were here illegally and, in 2004, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), (7)(A)(i)(I). The petitioners conceded removability but cross-applied for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>The IJ convened a hearing on April 17, 2007. Mariko, the only live witness, claimed that he feared persecution in his homeland on account of his membership in the Guinea People's Rally (RPG), a political party that opposed the party in power. He professed himself to have been the RPG's \"secretary for youth . . . something like that,\" whose duties included recruiting new members, campaigning, giving <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> speeches, and working with young people. These activities, he testified, led him into harm's way.</p>\n<p>Mariko recounted that, on November 11, 2001, armed soldiers broke up an RPG meeting and arrested him along with other party members. He was beaten, brought to a military camp, placed in a cell, and detained for approximately 19 days. His captors accused him of trying to overthrow the government and tortured him repeatedly. As a result of these beatings, Mariko sustained injuries \"everywhere\" from his neck to his waist and bled profusely from \"tears\" on his body. In addition, his thumb was permanently damaged (though he could not remember when or how this occurred).</p>\n<p>Mariko eventually escaped from the camp and made his way to a friend's house. He later purchased a phony passport and traveled to France. Once there, he purchased a second passport, used it fraudulently to fly to Chicago, and then journeyed to Rhode Island to join his wife.</p>\n<p>Under cross-examination, Mariko said that he possesses a birth certificate, Guinean passport, and national identification card. He told the IJ that his brother (who still lived in Guinea) had procured these documents and mailed them to him in 2004 or 2005. He conceded that, when he received his identification card, it bore both a signature and a fingerprint. Since the petitioner had not been in Guinea since 2001, the signature and fingerprint were necessarily bogus. Mariko further admitted that his passport may have been obtained fraudulently.</p>\n<p>To support his claim of mistreatment while in Guinea, Mariko had introduced into evidence a summary of his medical records. On cross-examination, he was unable to explain why his medical records reflected injuries only to his thumb and ring finger. He was equally at a loss to explain how this jibed with his assertion that he was \"wounded everywhere.\" His claim that he had received the summary document by mail in either 2002 or 2003 was suspect on its face; the medical records bore a date of June 6, 2006.</p>\n<p>Mariko's grasp of the politics of his homeland seemed shaky. Though he correctly identified the leader of the RPG, he evaded direct questions about significant events in the annals of the party. In a similar vein, he failed to explain inconsistencies between his testimony and his earlier affidavit in support of his application for relief, including inconsistencies regarding the frequency of the torture that he had endured.</p>\n<p>Faced with this scumbled record, the IJ denied the application for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. The cornerstone of the IJ's decision was an adverse credibility determination. Once Mariko's testimony was discounted on that basis, what remained was insufficient to sustain the petitioners' devoir of persuasion on their claims for relief.</p>\n<p>The petitioners appealed to the BIA, challenging the adverse credibility determination. They argued that the IJ (i) erroneously concluded that Mariko's testimony lacked sufficient detail; (ii) ascribed too much weight to Mariko's use of questionable documents; and (iii) relied too heavily on Mariko's inability to specify the date when he received the medical records.</p>\n<p>On December 1, 2008while their appeal to the BIA was pendingthe petitioners filed a motion to remand. They theorized that Kaba was newly eligible for asylum based upon changed circumstances. In support, they cited (i) the birth of their daughter, Su-ad, on September 17, 2008, and (ii) an opinion recently issued by the Attorney General in an unrelated case. In an order dated March 10, 2009, the BIA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision and simultaneously denied the motion to remand. With respect to the latter, the BIA noted that Kaba had premised her new asylum claim solely on a fear that her newborn daughter probably would fall victim to female genital mutilation (FGM) in Guinea. Such a claim, the BIA concluded, was inadequate on its face. This timely petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>On a petition for judicial review, we typically direct our appraisal to the final orders of the BIA. <i>Seng v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435797\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435797/seng-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2009). But where \"the BIA has adopted the IJ's decision in whole or in part, we review the pertinent portions of the IJ's decision as well.\" <i>Rivas-Mira v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 2009). This is such a case.</p>\n<p>In conducting this review, we examine findings of fact (including credibility determinations) under the substantial evidence standard. <i>López-Castro v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203958\"><a href=\"/opinion/203958/lopez-castro-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Da Silva v.

This standard requires us to defer to the agency's findings as long as they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 120 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 481, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span> (1992)). Absent an error of law, we will reverse only if the record compels a conclusion contrary to that reached by the agency.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203441\"><a href=\"/opinion/203441/chhay-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Adjudicated Claims.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We begin with the adjudicated claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Withholding of Removal.</i> A well-defined legal framework governs applications for withholding of removal. The applicant must show that, independent of any presumption, there is a clear probability that he will be subjected to persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground upon repatriation. <i>See </i><i>López-Castro,</i> 577 F.3d at 52; <i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 6. For this purpose, there are five statutorily protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, Mariko alleges persecution on account of his political opinion, as manifested by his membership in the RPG. This is a statutorily protected ground. Building on that foundation, he rehearses the persecution that he claims to have suffered in the past, asserts that the same regime remains in power, and voices his fear of being harmed upon his return to Guinea. The IJ and the BIA rejected this claim primarily because of doubts about the veracity of Mariko's account of past persecution.</p>\n<p>Before turning to the supportability of this determination, we pause to make an important temporal point. Mariko filed his application for relief after May 11, 2005. Thus, his case is controlled by the credibility standard embedded in the REAL ID Act of 2005. Pub.L. No. 109-13, § 101(a)(3), 119 Stat. 302, 303 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii)). In gauging credibility under that standard, an IJ is directed to consider the \"totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors,\" including but not limited to the alien's demeanor, responsiveness, and prior statements. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> <i>Id.</i> The IJ may also consider, where relevant, the plausibility of the alien's story and the presence or absence of corroborative evidence. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). If the IJ reasonably deems the alien's testimony \"speculative or unworthy of credence,\" that testimony may be either discounted or disregarded entirely. <i>Rivas-Mira,</i> 556 F.3d at 4 (quoting <i>Bebri v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203527\"><a href=\"/opinion/203527/bebri-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p>In denying withholding of removal, the IJ concluded that Mariko's tale was not believable. Mariko strives to persuade us that this adverse credibility determination was not predicated on substantial evidence. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p>The IJ's determination was based on a series of specific findings. First, the IJ concluded that Mariko's use of fraudulent identification documents undermined his credibility. The factual premise on which this conclusion rests is rock-solid: Mariko admitted, in effect, that his identity card bore a signature and a fingerprint that did not belong to him. He also conceded that he had used fraudulent passports in the course of his journey to the United States and that the passport currently in his possession might be fraudulent. Though there may be valid reasons for an émigré to make use of fraudulent documents to escape from persecution, this case bears no such hallmark. After all, Mariko obtained a third fraudulent passport and the bogus identification card <i>after</i> he was safely within the United States. Moreover, he testified that his motivation behind obtaining these documents was that he \"got the lottery\" and \"wanted to get some documents from [his] country.\" On this record, the IJ was entitled to draw an inference of untrustworthiness from this serial use of fraudulent documentation. <i>See </i><i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, 22 n. 5 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>A second data point to which the IJ adverted concerned the inconsistencies between Mariko's words and the medical records. In his testimony, Mariko alleged that soldiers had subjected him to full-body beatings and caused numerous \"tears\" in his skin. But the medical records noted only a hand injury. Mariko was unable either to explain this discrepancy or to pin down the time when the medical records were generated.</p>\n<p>Third, the IJ found Mariko's professed relationship to the RPG to be \"vague\" and his testimony on this point lacking in detail. As an example, the IJ noted Mariko's inability to define his role in the organization. We view these findings as part and parcel of the IJ's global finding that Mariko's demeanor was disconcerting (and, thus, suggestive of untruthfulness). In this regard, the IJ noted that the pace of Mariko's testimony \"slowed perceptibly\" when he was asked about his potential involvement.</p>\n<p>Finally, the IJ found significant inconsistencies between the affidavit that Mariko submitted in support of his original application for relief and his hearing testimony. These inconsistencies related to such things as the beatings, his detention, and his interrogation. For example, in his affidavit Mariko vouchsafed that he was interrogated on each of the 19 days that he was detained and beaten each time that he was interrogated. In his testimony, however, he said that he was beaten only three to five times during the entire 19-day span.</p>\n<p>To bolster their argument that the IJ's adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, the petitioners attempt to trivialize the individual failings and inconsistencies catalogued by the IJ. But the whole sometimes can exceed the sum of the parts, and the appropriate test focuses on the totality of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> the circumstances. The IJ's findings, in cumulation, constitute substantial evidence. <i>See </i><i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2007) (\"Some of these inconsistencies, in isolation, may seem like small potatoes. What counts, however, is that their cumulative effect is great.\"). The record evidence is not such as to compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination and, thus, the IJ's assessment of Mariko's credibility deserves our approbation. <i>See </i><i>Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 4-5; <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). Given that supportable determination, it follows inexorably that the BIA's denial of Mariko's application for withholding of removal must be upheld.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Protection under the CAT.</i> This leaves Mariko's claim for protection under the CAT. To succeed on this claim Mariko had to prove that, more likely than not, he would be tortured if deported to his homeland. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); <i>see also </i><i>Ahmed v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150524\"><a href=\"/opinion/150524/ahmed-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 97-98 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>On the facts of this case, Mariko's CAT claim is inextricably intertwined with his withholding of removal claim. Thus, what we have said about the supportability of the adverse credibility determination dooms Mariko's claim for CAT protection just as surely as it doomed his claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Motion to Remand.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The last leg of our journey tracks the BIA's denial of the petitioners' motion. The petitioners styled their motion as a motion \"to remand.\" This nomenclature does not affect the applicable legal framework. <i>See </i><i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202370\"><a href=\"/opinion/202370/conteh-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 63-64 (1st Cir.2006). When, as in this case, an appealing alien has filed a motion that seeks to have the BIA return an appealed case to the IJ for further proceedings based on newly available information, that motion, however denominated, must satisfy the requirements that attend a motion to reopen. <i>See </i><i>Falae v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790569\"><a href=\"/opinion/790569/michael-olusean-falae-aka-vincent-olanrewaju-adeyemi-v-alberto-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2005); <i>In re Coelho,</i> 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992).</p>\n<p>The BIA may rely on any of three independent grounds in denying a motion to reopen: failure to make out a prima facie case for the relief sought; failure to identify new and material evidence, previously unavailable; or, even if these requirements are met, failure to establish an entitlement to the discretionary relief sought. <i>INS v. Doherty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112677\"><a href=\"/opinion/112677/ins-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 323, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112677\"><a href=\"/opinion/112677/ins-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112677\"><a href=\"/opinion/112677/ins-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span> (1992). Here, the BIA denied the petitioners' motion on the first ground. We review this denial for abuse of discretion. <i>Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2003). We will interfere with the BIA's exercise of discretion only if it appears that the BIA made \"an error of law or acted in a manner that is fairly characterizable as arbitrary or capricious.\" <i>Falae,</i> 411 F.3d at 14.</p>\n<p>The motion to remand asserted that Kaba was newly eligible to apply for asylum due to changed circumstances.<sup>[3]</sup> Pertinently, the term \"changed circumstances\" is a term of art. It means \"changes in the applicant's circumstances that materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum, including changes in applicable U.S. law and activities the applicant becomes involved in outside the country of feared persecution that place the applicant at risk.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(B). In support, the petitioners <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> cited two items: the birth of their daughter, Su-ad, on September 17, 2008,<sup>[4]</sup> and the Attorney General's opinion in <i>Matter of A-T-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 617 (A.G. 2008). We examine each item.</p>\n<p>The petitioners' claim that Su-ad's birth constituted a material change in circumstances rests on an allegation that both Kaba and her older daughter had been subjected to FGM in Guinea. The petitioners maintained that, for this reason, they feared that Su-ad would suffer the same fate if the family returned to that country.</p>\n<p>The BIA rejected this proposition, relying on its own precedent as well as jurisprudence from this court. In <i>Matter of A-K-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 275 (BIA 2007), the BIA concluded that a father was not eligible for either asylum or withholding of removal based on his claim that his United States citizen daughters would be subjected to FGM in his homeland. <i>Id.</i> at 277-78.</p>\n<p><i>Matter of A-K-</i> is not an outlier. We, too, have affirmed BIA decisions denying asylum based on potential persecution of family members. Thus, in <i>Kechichian v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203402\"><a href=\"/opinion/203402/kechichian-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2008), we held that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to reopen based on the potential persecution of the alien's son. <i>Id.</i> at 22. The same principle anchored our decision in <i>Burbiene v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203847\"><a href=\"/opinion/203847/burbiene-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span>, 254 n. 3 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Those decisions are controlling here. Although a child may be a derivative beneficiary of a parent's claim for asylum, the grounds for asylum must relate directly to the parent's situation. There is no authority, either statutory or in the case law, that indicates that the parent may, in effect, be a derivative beneficiary of her child's asylum claim. The BIA was, therefore, warranted in refusing to reopen the case to allow Kaba to pursue a theory on which she could not prevail.</p>\n<p>We deal next with the petitioners' asseveration that <i>Matter of A-T-</i> represented a \"change[] in applicable U.S. law,\" which entitles Kaba to asylum. This asseveration lacks force.</p>\n<p>In <i>Matter of A-T-,</i> the Attorney General vacated the BIA's denial of an adult woman's application for withholding of removal. 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 617-18. The Attorney General concluded that the agency had erred in finding that, because FGM \"cannot occur more than once\" to any one person, the application had to be denied on the ground that the feared future persecution could not \"take precisely the same form as past persecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 621. The Attorney General instructed the BIA, on remand, to determine whether the fact that the alien had been subjected to FGM in the past triggered a presumption of a continuing threat to her life or freedom on account of her membership in a particular social group (presumably women who had been subjected to FGM). <i>Id.</i> at 623; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i).</p>\n<p>This opinion does not help the petitioners. While Kaba had undergone FGM as a child in Guinea, her claim of eligibility for asylum was not based either on her plight or on her membership in a class of females who had been similarly brutalized. Rather, Kaba premised her claim on a fear that her daughter would be subjected to FGM if she were relocated to Guinea. <i>Matter of A-T-</i> is, therefore, not on point.</p>\n<p>In an effort to detour around this reasoning, the petitioners suggest in this court, for the first time, that Kaba herself <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> harbors a well-founded fear of future persecution based on her childhood experience with FGM. This suggestion comes too late in the day. A petitioner must exhaust her administrative remedies by presenting each of her claims face up and squarely to the agency. <i>See </i><i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 5-6. This court cannot consider an unexhausted claim on a petition for judicial review. <i>See id.</i> This restraint is consistent with the statutory directive that statutory authority allows review of a final removal order only after \"the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1); <i>see also </i><i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that theories not seasonably advanced before the BIA cannot be presented for the first time in the court of appeals).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we deny the petition for judicial review in all of its particulars.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We use the terms \"lead\" and \"derivative\" because, in his application, Mariko described Kaba as a derivative beneficiary of his claims for relief. The petitioners' brief continues this usage. We note, however, that Mariko only applied for withholding of removal and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT). The statutory provision that the petitioners cite, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A), allows for derivative status only when the lead petitioner applies for asylum. The regulations concerning withholding of removal and CAT protection make no allowance for derivative claims. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b), (c). Accordingly, derivative claims cannot be prosecuted for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT. <i>See </i><i>Warui v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203959\"><a href=\"/opinion/203959/warui-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p>[2]  Abstract legal determinations are afforded de novo review, subject to some measure of deference to the agency's interpretation of statutes and regulations that fall within its ambit. <i>See </i><i>Seng,</i> 584 F.3d at 17. This review modality is not implicated here.</p>\n<p>[3]  Originally, both Mariko and Kaba were time-barred from pursuing asylum because each of them was in the United States for more than a year before joining any application for relief. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); <i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 4.</p>\n<p>[4]  Because Su-ad was born in the United States, sheunlike her parentsis a United States citizen. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wong Kim Ark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94842\"><a href=\"/opinion/94842/united-states-v-wong-kim-ark/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span>, 702, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
