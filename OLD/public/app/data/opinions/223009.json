Joseph N. Laplante, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n               Boudin and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Thomas J. Moore with whom Bacon & Thomas, PLLC, Peter G.\nCallaghan and Preti Flaherty Beliveau Pachios PLLP were on brief\nfor appellants.\n     Jordan L. Hirsch with whom Michael J. Summersgill and Wilmer\nCutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 11, 2011\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.          This is an interlocutory appeal\n\nfrom    a    district          court     order        preliminarily      enjoining\n\ndefendants-appellants Chance Mold Steel Company, Ltd. and EKTouch\n\nCompany, Ltd. (\"Chance\") from selling computer mouse products\n\nsimilar to or derived from those made by plaintiff-appellee Contour\n\nDesign, Inc. (\"Contour\"). Because a merits trial has now been held\n\nand the preliminary injunction will shortly be superceded, only\n\nbrief discussion is required.\n\n            Contour     designs,       manufactures,       and   sells   ergonomic\n\ncomputer    mice.      In    1995,     Contour    contracted     with    Chance   to\n\nmanufacture its products in bulk.              Contour's founder, Steven Wang,\n\nchose Chance based on assurances that Chance would keep Contour's\n\nproduct design information secret.                The parties formalized that\n\nunderstanding in a non-disclosure agreement (\"NDA\") dated June 15,\n\n1995, which has a term of 20 years.\n\n            After identifying the \"Product\" as inventions, designs,\n\nmethods and related information concerning computer mouse products,\n\nSection 1 of the NDA precludes Chance from disclosing, using, or\n\ncopying Contour's \"Confidential Information,\" and Section 3 of the\n\nNDA    further      prevents      Chance       from     duplicating,     producing,\n\nmanufacturing, or otherwise commercially exploiting the Product, or\n\ndeveloping other products derived from the Product.\n\n            For     almost   15    years,      Chance    manufactured     different\n\ncomputer mouse products for Contour and kept confidential all of\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fContour's product information, but, in 2009, Chance began to make\n\nnear copies of two Contour mice and concedes that it used Contour's\n\nproduction tooling to make them.            Contour then filed suit against\n\nChance in federal district court in New Hampshire charging Chance\n\nwith violating the New Hampshire Uniform Trade Secrets Act, N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. § 350-B:1 to -B:9 (2011), and with breach of\n\ncontract.\n\n             In November 2010, after an evidentiary hearing, the\n\ndistrict     court     adopted       a    magistrate    judge's      report   and\n\nrecommendation and entered a preliminary injunction against Chance.\n\nAmong other things, Chance was ordered to stop producing the two\n\nmice or any other products derived from the two Contour mice from\n\nwhich the Chance counterparts had been derived.                Chance appealed\n\nfrom the preliminary injunction and this court heard argument.\n\n             Following argument, the panel concluded at semble that\n\nContour had adequately shown that it was likely to prevail on the\n\nmerits and that the other familiar considerations--irreparable\n\ninjury, the equities and the public interest, Naser Jewelers, Inc.\n\nv.   City    of    Concord,    513   F.3d   27,   32   (1st   Cir.   2008)--were\n\nconsistent with relief.         However, because a trial was scheduled to\n\nbe   held,   the    court     made   no   announcement,   expecting    that the\n\npreliminary injunction would be supplanted by a final injunction\n\nand other possible relief. See, e.g., Smith v. Ill. Bell Tel. Co.,\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f270 U.S. 587, 588-89 (1926); In re Estate of Ferdinand Marcos Human\n\nRights Litig., 94 F.3d 539, 544 (9th Cir. 1996) (collecting cases).\n\n          On May 24, 2011, after a six-day trial, a jury found that\n\nChance had misappropriated Contour's trade secrets and breached the\n\nNDA, awarding $7.7 million in damages.       At present, there are\n\npost-trial matters pending in the district court and a permanent\n\ninjunction has yet to be framed.   However, the district court may\n\nbe awaiting disposition of this appeal before entering final\n\njudgment including a permanent injunction.\n\n          Because copying of Contour's mice was more or less\n\nconceded, the principal issues raised by Chance on this appeal\n\nconcerned the validity and breadth of the NDA.    Chance urged, in\n\nparticular, that what was protected under the NDA was unclear, that\n\nthe agreement was too vague to be enforced, and that in all events\n\nthe NDA should be read to protect only the Contour mice in\n\nexistence in 1995 and not those that Contour created afterwards and\n\nasked Chance to produce for Contour.\n\n          But to the extent that the NDA's bare language might be\n\nviewed as ambiguous, the district court was entitled to consider\n\nthe contract as a whole and any extrinsic evidence that might cast\n\nlight on the parties' mutual intent. See, e.g., Birch Broad., Inc.\n\nv. Capitol Broad. Corp., 13 A.3d 224, 228 (N.H. 2010).   At the time\n\nof the preliminary injunction, Contour had pointed to various\n\ncircumstances supporting its position, including the duration of\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fthe   NDA--hardly    consistent     with    protecting     only    an   existing\n\nproduct--and extrinsic evidence of discussions between the parties.\n\n            There is no reason to describe in detail that evidence\n\nwhich may have taken a different form at trial, nor to consider in\n\ndetail a patent license provided by Contour to a Swedish company\n\nand now relied on by Chance.1             It is enough that what Contour\n\nidentified in the preliminary injunction phase of the case amply\n\nsupported   the   district      court's    decision   to   grant   preliminary\n\nrelief--a decision that now appears to be vindicated by the jury's\n\nverdict.     Based   on   the    then-existing record,       the    relief   was\n\nentirely proper.\n\n            It may be helpful to make clear for the benefit of future\n\ncontroversies that the district court was free, and would remain\n\nfree even without this affirmance or leave from us, to enter a\n\npermanent injunction based on the trial record while the original\n\nappeal remained pending.         True, once an appeal has been taken, a\n\ndistrict court ordinarily may not alter the judgment under review,\n\nwithout leave of the appellate court.         Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1; Puerto\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      In May 2009, Contour apparently settled a patent dispute with\nthe Swedish company and licensed it to make, or have made, Contour\nmice of the type copied by Chance. Chance in turn began to supply\nChance's knock-offs to the Swedish company. Whatever protection\nChance might collaterally derive from the license (e.g. from a\npatent infringement suit)--which we do not decide--nothing\nindicates that it would free Chance from the NDA restrictions\ninvoked in this case.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fRico v. SS Zoe Colocotroni, 601 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 1979); cf.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 62(c) (contemplating limited exceptions).\n\n           However, in most respects and absent a stay, further\n\nproceedings in the same controversy often may continue in the\n\ndistrict court while an appeal in an earlier phase is pending.            See\n\nEx parte Nat'l Enameling & Stamping Co., 201 U.S. 156, 162 (1906)\n\n(\"The   case,   except   for   the   hearing   on   the   appeal   from   the\n\ninterlocutory order, is to proceed in the lower court as though no\n\nsuch appeal had been taken, unless otherwise specially ordered.\").\n\nTo conduct a trial and grant or deny a permanent injunction based\n\non that trial is standard practice.        See Ry. Labor Execs. Ass'n      v.\n\nCity of Galveston, 898 F.2d 481 (5th Cir. 1990).\n\n           An appeal from the grant or denial of a\n           preliminary injunction does not divest the\n           trial court of jurisdiction or prevent it from\n           taking other steps in the litigation while the\n           appeal is pending. . . . The only restriction\n           on the trial court's power occurs if the\n           appellate court enters an order staying the\n           lower court until the appeal has been\n           completed.\n\n11A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2962, at\n\n438-39 (2d ed. 1995); accord Janousek v. Doyle, 313 F.2d 916, 920\n\n(8th Cir. 1963).\n\n           As for appellate courts, there is no fixed rule as to\n\nwhether and when it makes sense to press ahead while the district\n\ncourt acts.     Sometimes, where the preliminary relief granted is\n\ndoubtful or resolving a pure issue of law may help with jury\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\finstructions,    a   prompt      appellate    decision     on   the   preliminary\n\ninjunction may be important; in other cases, sometimes not. Either\n\nway,   the   district    court    is   free   to   carry    forward    and   order\n\npermanent relief after the merits are resolved.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f",

Chance urged, in particular, that what was protected under the NDA was unclear, that the agreement was too vague to be enforced, and that in all events the NDA should be read to protect only the Contour mice in existence in 1995 and not those that Contour created afterwards and asked Chance to produce for Contour.</p>\n<p>But to the extent that the NDA's bare language might be viewed as ambiguous, the district court was entitled to consider the contract as a whole and any extrinsic evidence that might cast light on the parties' mutual intent. <i>See, e.g., Birch Broad., Inc. v. Capitol Broad. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2422764\"><a href=\"/opinion/2422764/birch-broadcasting-v-capitol-broadcasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 228 (2010). At the time of the preliminary injunction, Contour had pointed to various circumstances supporting its position, including the duration of the NDAhardly consistent with protecting only an existing productand extrinsic evidence of discussions between the parties.</p>\n<p>There is no reason to describe in detail that evidence which may have taken a different form at trial, nor to consider in detail a patent license provided by Contour to a Swedish company and now relied on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> by Chance.<sup>[1]</sup> It is enough that what Contour identified in the preliminary injunction phase of the case amply supported the district court's decision to grant preliminary reliefa decision that now appears to be vindicated by the jury's verdict. Based on the then-existing record, the relief was entirely proper.</p>\n<p>It may be helpful to make clear for the benefit of future controversies that the district court was free, and would remain free even without this affirmance or leave from us, to enter a permanent injunction based on the trial record while the original appeal remained pending. True, once an appeal has been taken, a district court ordinarily may not alter the judgment under review, without leave of the appellate court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 62.1; <i>Puerto Rico v. SS Zoe Colocotroni,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367236\"><a href=\"/opinion/367236/commonwealth-of-puerto-rico-v-the-ss-zoe-colocotroni-her-engines/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1979); <i>cf.</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 62(c) (contemplating limited exceptions).</p>\n<p>However, in most respects and absent a stay, further proceedings in the same controversy often may continue in the district court while an appeal in an earlier phase is pending. <i>See </i><i>Ex parte Nat'l Enameling &amp; Stamping Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1279939\"><a href=\"/opinion/1279939/ex-parte-national-enameling-and-stamping-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, 162, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></span> (1906) (\"The case, except for the hearing on the appeal from the interlocutory order, is to proceed in the lower court as though no such appeal had been taken, unless otherwise specially ordered.\"). To conduct a trial and grant or deny a permanent injunction based on that trial is standard practice. <i>See </i><i>Ry. Labor Execs. Ass'n v. City of Galveston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538414\"><a href=\"/opinion/538414/railway-labor-executives-association-v-city-of-galveston-texas-acting/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<blockquote>An appeal from the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction or prevent it from taking other steps in the litigation while the appeal is pending.... The only restriction on the trial court's power occurs if the appellate court enters an order staying the lower court until the appeal has been completed.</blockquote>\n<p>11A Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 2962, at 438-39 (2d ed.1995); <i>accord </i><i>Janousek v. Doyle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"259742\"><a href=\"/opinion/259742/joseph-o-janousek-v-harold-c-doyle-louis-b-french-edward-sampson/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span>, 920 (8th Cir.1963).</p>\n<p>As for appellate courts, there is no fixed rule as to whether and when it makes sense to press ahead while the district court acts. Sometimes, where the preliminary relief granted is doubtful or resolving a pure issue of law may help with jury instructions, a prompt appellate decision on the preliminary injunction may be important; in other cases, sometimes not. Either way, the district court is free to carry forward and order permanent relief after the merits are resolved.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In May 2009, Contour apparently settled a patent dispute with the Swedish company and licensed it to make, or have made, Contour mice of the type copied by Chance. Chance in turn began to supply Chance's knock-offs to the Swedish company. Whatever protection Chance might collaterally derive from the license (e.g. from a patent infringement suit)which we do not decidenothing indicates that it would free Chance from the NDA restrictions invoked in this case.</p>\n\n</div>",
