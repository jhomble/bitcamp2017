Smith, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nCivil Division, with whom Tony West, Assistant Attorney General,\nand Greg D. Mack, Senior Litigation Counsel, were on brief, for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                        September 9, 2010\n\n\n\n     *\n       A pseudonym. This published opinion has been redacted to\nremove any identifying information. The original opinion remains\nunder seal.\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Petitioner John Smith seeks review\n\nof a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his\n\nmotion to reopen his removal proceedings so that he could apply for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT).    In his motion, Smith cited changed country\n\nconditions and new evidence that was unavailable to him during the\n\nproceedings on his initial application for adjustment of status.\n\nBecause we conclude that the BIA committed errors of law in\n\ndeciding that Smith had not shown changed country conditions or\n\nmade a prima facie case for relief, thereby abusing its discretion,\n\nwe grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           The evidence presented by Smith is fairly summarized as\n\nfollows.   Smith was born in Zimbabwe.    He is from a large family\n\nand his parents worked.   He became an active member of the Zimbabwe\n\nNational Students Union (ZINAZU), an organization that was opposed\n\nto the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU-PF) government then in\n\npower in Zimbabwe.   Smith held a position in ZINAZU and also joined\n\nthe Zimbabwe Unity Movement, a political movement seeking to unseat\n\nZANU-PF in the 1990 general election.    He had a leadership role in\n\nthat organization.   As a result of his political activities, Smith\n\nwas arrested and detained multiple times, first in the early 1990s,\n\nagain a few years later, and finally a few years after that.     On\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fall three occasions, he was beaten severely and threatened with\n\nfurther harm to himself and his family.\n\n                After his last, most severe detention and beating,\n\nSmith decided to leave Zimbabwe in an act of self-preservation. He\n\nentered the United States in the mid-1990s on a visa.          He attended\n\na college and then a university and earned a degree.          Smith worked\n\nfor two years as an environmental design engineer before becoming\n\na civil engineer with a firm in the United States, where he worked\n\nuntil several years ago.        During those years, he continued to\n\npursue his education.     In 2003, he earned a graduate degree from a\n\nuniversity.     From 2004 to 2007, he again attended a university he\n\nhad previously attended while he worked towards a second graduate\n\ndegree.\n\nA. Adjustment of Status\n\n           In the late 1990s, Smith married Sarah Jones, an American\n\ncitizen, with whom he later had a son, also named John.1         Smith and\n\nJones sought to adjust his immigration status based on their\n\nmarriage   by   filing   an   I-130   visa   petition   and   applying   for\n\nadjustment of Smith's immigration status.        Smith's application for\n\nadjustment of status was initially denied when Jones withdrew her\n\nsupport, but was reopened sometime in the early 2000s after Jones\n\nfiled another I-130 visa petition on Smith's behalf.               Smith's\n\n\n\n     1\n      The marriage ended after seven years, in 2006, the same year\nJohn was born.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fsecond application was also denied in the mid-2000s, after a\n\nhearing before an immigration judge.             Although the immigration\n\njudge found Smith to be credible and that his marriage was bona\n\nfide, she cited Jones's failure to appear in support of Smith in\n\nrefusing to adjust his status. The immigration judge granted Smith\n\nvoluntary departure with an alternate order of removal to Zimbabwe.\n\nSmith's appeal of that decision was dismissed by the BIA.                  In a\n\nbrief   opinion,     the   BIA   stated   that     the    outcome    was    \"an\n\nunderstandable and appropriate exercise of the Immigration Judge's\n\ndiscretion to deny adjustment of status.\"\n\nB. Motion to Reopen\n\n            In the late 2000s, more than a year after his appeal was\n\ndismissed, Smith filed a pro se motion to reopen his removal\n\nproceedings with the BIA so that he could apply for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and CAT protection.            In the motion, Smith\n\nstated that he feared being persecuted and tortured if returned to\n\nZimbabwe.     That    argument   was   based,     in    part,   on   his   past\n\npersecution by the reigning ZANU-PF regime.            As required to excuse\n\nhis failure to file a motion to reopen within the ninety-day\n\nstatutory window, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), Smith argued\n\nthat in the time since the BIA dismissed his appeal in the mid-\n\n2000s, conditions in Zimbabwe had changed dramatically for the\n\nworse for those who, like him, had been active opponents of the\n\nZANU-PF or whose families had been labeled as opposition.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            In support of his motion to reopen, Smith submitted an\n\naffidavit    describing     his   earlier     persecution       for   his    earlier\n\nactivism    against   the   ZANU-PF.         He    also    detailed   more    recent\n\nviolence against his family in Zimbabwe.2                 According to Smith, his\n\nfamily has been harassed, intimidated, and physically attacked for\n\nallegedly    sympathizing     with   neighboring           white   farmers.       He\n\ndescribed two violent attacks in the mid-2000s, one in which his\n\nfather was attacked violently, and another in which a cousin who\n\nlived with close family was killed by the ZANU-PF youth militia.\n\nIn the late 2000s, the family was targeted once again for its\n\npolitical    sympathies.      The    April        2008    elections   in    Zimbabwe\n\nresulted in the withdrawal of the candidate of the opposition,\n\nMovement for Democratic Change (MDC), due to ZANU-PF-directed\n\nviolence that made it impossible to conduct a free and fair\n\nelection.     According to Smith, his family did not vote in the\n\nelections. Nevertheless, shortly after the election, ZANU-PF youth\n\nmilitia invaded Smith's parents' home in retaliation for the heavy\n\nsupport the MDC received in the elections in the area where they\n\nlived.      The family's home was destroyed and his family members\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       By way of background, Smith made a public statement\nregarding his political views of the Zimbabwe regime while in the\nUnited States. The public statement was seen in Zimbabwe and his\nclose family then contacted him to let him know that his actions\nwere extremely dangerous for family still in Zimbabwe.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fwere attacked.         Another individual was killed.               Smith's family\n\nmembers escaped to another country.3\n\n              Smith also submitted evidence that failed asylum seekers\n\nwho   were    returned    to    Zimbabwe    were     being   subjected      to    harsh\n\ninterrogation by the government's Central Intelligence Organization\n\n(CIO).    He included a judicial opinion from the United Kingdom in\n\nwhich the court concluded, based on extensive testimony, that\n\nbecause      failed    asylum    applicants     are    not     channeled     to    the\n\nimmigration authorities, but are instead immediately screened and\n\ninterrogated      by     the    central    intelligence      arm,    they    face    a\n\nheightened risk of physical violence.               The court made this finding\n\nafter hearing credible testimony that beatings are \"a systemic\n\nfeature of a CIO investigation,\" particularly for opponents of the\n\nZANU-PF.\n\n              Finally,    Smith's    motion     to    reopen    included     country\n\nreports and other documents showing that both government and non-\n\ngovernmental organization observers agreed that human rights abuses\n\nby the ZANU-PF were worsening in Zimbabwe.                   For example, a U.S.\n\nState Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices in\n\nZimbabwe shows, among other things, that ZANU-PF-sponsored torture\n\nin Zimbabwe increased almost threefold between 2006 and 2007 (from\n\n1,185 incidents to 3,463 incidents).               The State Department reports\n\n\n      3\n       Several days before the BIA ruled on his motion to reopen,\na close family member of Smith's was killed after returning to\nZimbabwe.\n\n                                          -6-\n\falso   describe   a     \"systematic       government-sponsored     campaign     to\n\ndismantle the opposition party's structures\" prior to the 2008\n\nelections through violence directed at supporters, expulsion of\n\nvillagers who supported the MDC, and withholding of government-\n\nsupplied food aid from MDC supporters.              A 2006 report from Human\n\nRights Watch concluded, similarly, that \"[v]iolent repression of\n\ncivil society activists by state authorities in Zimbabwe continues\n\nto escalate.\"\n\nC. The BIA's Order\n\n           The BIA denied Smith's motion to reopen, concluding that\n\nit was not timely because it had not been filed within ninety days\n\nof the final decision on his application for adjustment of status,\n\nas required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).            Although recognizing that\n\nthere is an exception to the ninety-day time limit for motions to\n\nreopen where an alien is seeking asylum and withholding of removal\n\nbased on changed circumstances in the country of nationality or the\n\ncountry   to   which    removal     has    been   ordered,   see   8   C.F.R.    §\n\n1003.2(c)(3)(ii), the BIA found that Smith had not demonstrated\n\n\"that conditions have materially changed for him in Zimbabwe.\"\n\n           The    BIA    rejected     Smith's     claim   that   conditions     in\n\nZimbabwe worsened for opposition supporters before and after the\n\n2008 elections.       The Board found that \"[e]vidence that the ZANU-PF\n\nhas been abusing individuals who voted for the MDC in the April\n\n2008 elections is immaterial to [Smith]\" because \"he was not even\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fpresent in Zimbabwe\" during the elections and does not claim to\n\nhave voted in them. The BIA dismissed Smith's evidence of violence\n\nagainst his family, noting \"the mere fact that [Smith's] family was\n\ntargeted . . . standing alone, does not make a prima facie showing\n\nthat the respondent himself may face persecution on account of a\n\nprotected ground under the Act or torture upon his repatriation.\"\n\n           Similarly, the BIA reasoned that evidence that \"state-\n\nsponsored abuse of opposition activists in Zimbabwe has increased\n\nin the last few years, standing alone, does not reflect material\n\n[sic] changed country conditions for the respondent.\"          The BIA\n\nfound that Smith had not identified \"evidence that would indicate\n\nthat   conditions   have   deteriorated   or   otherwise   changed   for\n\nindividuals like himself who were politically active in Zimbabwe so\n\nlong ago.\"\n\n           Finally, the Board rejected the evidence Smith introduced\n\nshowing that Britain had granted asylum to a Zimbabwean national\n\nbecause of the danger to rejected asylum seekers who are returned\n\nto Zimbabwe.   The BIA called that information \"immaterial to the\n\nrespondent\" because he would not be removed \"under that process.\"\n\nThe BIA asserted that Smith's claim was also \"speculative\" because\n\n\"United States-based asylum proceedings are required by law . . .\n\nto remain confidential.\"      The BIA noted that the fact that the\n\nZANU-PF government is suspicious of the United States \"does not\n\nnecessarily mean that [Smith] may face persecution and torture upon\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fhis removal.\"     Again, the BIA found that \"standing alone,\" Smith's\n\nevidence was \"insufficient to make a prima facie showing\" that he\n\nmay be subject to persecution if returned to Zimbabwe.4\n\n             Smith filed this timely petition seeking review of the\n\nBoard's denial of his motion to reopen.\n\n                                          II.\n\n             The BIA has jurisdiction over motions to reopen removal\n\nproceedings     under    8   C.F.R.   §    1003.2(a).   We,   in   turn,   have\n\njurisdiction over Smith's petition for review under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252.       See Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(finding that, under the Supreme Court's recent decision in Kucana\n\nv. Holder, 130 S. Ct. 827, 840 (2010), \"courts generally have\n\njurisdiction to review the BIA's decision to grant or deny [motions\n\nto reopen]\").5\n\n             The scope of our review of the Board's order denying\n\nSmith's motion to reopen is limited.            See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S.\n\n314, 323 (1992).        The BIA has \"broad discretion, conferred by the\n\nAttorney General, 'to grant or deny a motion to reopen.'\"             Kucana,\n\n\n\n        4\n       In response to Smith's motion for reconsideration of its\norder denying his motion to reopen, the BIA affirmed its previous\nruling. Smith appeals only the BIA's initial denial of his motion\nto reopen.\n        5\n       We note that here, as in Neves, Smith does not seek \"review\nof any of the kinds of decisions on admissibility by immigration\nofficers insulated from review under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A), and\nhe is not removable as an aggravated felon, see id. §\n1252(a)(2)(C).\" 613 F.3d at 35 n.2.\n\n                                          -9-\n\f130 S. Ct. at 838 (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a)).     We therefore\n\nreview for abuse of discretion the BIA's denial of Smith's motion.\n\nFesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).    Under the\n\nabuse of discretion standard, we \"uphold the agency's subsidiary\n\nfindings of fact as long as they are supported by substantial\n\nevidence,\" we review \"embedded legal conclusions de novo,\" and we\n\n\"review judgment calls for abuse of discretion.\"   Vaz Dos Reis v.\n\nHolder, 606 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2010).   A material error of law is\n\nan abuse of discretion.   Id.\n\n                                III.\n\n          This appeal turns on two related but distinct questions:\n\nfirst, whether Smith has presented sufficient evidence of changed\n\ncountry conditions to permit him to file a motion to reopen more\n\nthan ninety days after the BIA rejected his claims; and second,\n\nwhether the new evidence Smith has presented, together with the\n\nevidence already in the record, shows that he has a reasonable\n\nlikelihood of prevailing on his asylum, withholding of removal, or\n\nCAT claims -- in other words, whether he has presented a prima\n\nfacie case for any of those types of relief.       While the first\n\nquestion goes to Smith's procedural right to bring his motion to\n\nreopen, the second goes to the merits of his claim.     We conclude\n\nthat the decision of the BIA, which answered both questions in the\n\nnegative, was based on legal error; thus, the BIA abused its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f          There   are   both   substantive   and   procedural   bars   to\n\nreopening removal proceedings. Substantively, federal regulations\n\ncreate two \"threshold requirements for a motion to reopen: that it\n\nestablish 'a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief\n\nsought' and that it introduce 'previously unavailable, material\n\nevidence.'\"   Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 20 (quoting INS v. Abudu, 485\n\nU.S. 92, 104 (1988)); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).         The BIA\n\nmay deny a petition if it determines that the movant has failed to\n\nmeet either of those requirements.      In addition, the BIA may \"leap\n\nahead, as it were, over the two threshold concerns (prima facie\n\ncase and new evidence/reasonable explanation), and simply determine\n\nthat even if they were met, the movant would not be entitled to the\n\ndiscretionary grant of relief.\"     Abudu, 485 U.S. at 105.\n\n          Procedurally, a petitioner is limited to \"a single motion\n\nto reopen a removal proceeding\" which must be \"submitted within\n\nninety days of the rendition of the final administrative decision.\"\n\nRaza v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2)).    These limitations are relaxed \"only if a\n\npetitioner 'makes a convincing demonstration of changed conditions\n\nin his homeland.'\"   Tandayu v. Mukasey, 521 F.3d 97, 100 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting Raza, 484 F.3d at 127); see also 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.2(c)(3)(ii).    The change in conditions \"must be material to\n\nthe underlying substantive relief that the alien is seeking . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fand   the   evidence   tendered   in   support   thereof   must   have   been\n\nunavailable during the prior proceedings.\"         Raza, 484 F.3d at 127.\n\nA. Changed Country Conditions\n\n            Smith brought his motion to reopen more than ninety days\n\nafter the Board's final administrative decision. Because he missed\n\nthe ninety-day procedural window for filing his motion, Smith must\n\ndemonstrate changed conditions in his homeland that are material to\n\nhis claim of eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nCAT protection.    Tandayu, 521 F.3d at 100; Raza, 484 F.3d at 127.\n\nHis evidence of changed country conditions also must have been\n\n\"unavailable during the prior proceedings.\" Raza, 484 F.3d at 127.\n\n            As detailed above, to show changed country conditions,\n\nSmith presented evidence that in the time since his hearing before\n\nthe immigration judge and the BIA's rejection of his appeal,6 human\n\n\n\n      6\n       The applicable provision, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii),\nstates that the time and numerical limitations \"shall not apply\" to\na motion to reopen proceedings \"[t]o apply or reapply for asylum or\nwithholding of deportation based on changed circumstances . . . if\nsuch evidence is material and was not available and could not have\nbeen discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\" The Third\nCircuit has held that the phrase, \"discovered or presented at the\nprevious hearing,\" refers to the hearing before the immigration\njudge, not a proceeding before the BIA at which no new evidentiary\nmaterial could be presented. Filja v. Gonzalez, 447 F.3d 241, 254\n(3d Cir. 2006); see also, Sevoian v. Ashcroft, 290 F.3d 166, 174\n(3d Cir. 2002) (noting that \"reopening decision[s] [are] made . .\n. without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing on the new issues\nraised\"). That holding would place the relevant date for Smith's\nnew evidence in the mid-2000s. We need not determine here which\ndate applies, as the increase in violence against opposition\nsupporters and the violence against Smith's family occurred after\nboth dates.\n\n                                   -12-\n\frights   abuses,        particularly     directed      at    supporters     of   the\n\nopposition to the ZANU-PF government, have, in Smith's words, gone\n\nfrom \"general but not systematic\" to \"general, pervasive and\n\nsystematic.\"      Incidences of ZANU-PF-sponsored torture essentially\n\ntripled from 2006 to 2007.          In particular, the ZANU-PF government\n\ntargets those it suspects of supporting the opposition party.\n\nViolence of that nature struck Smith's family at that time, when\n\nhis cousin was murdered and his father was attacked violently, and\n\nagain a few years later, when the family members were driven from\n\ntheir property in a ward that had heavily supported the opposition\n\nin the 2008 elections.\n\n             In   its    opinion,    the    BIA   did       not   dispute   Smith's\n\nassessment of conditions in Zimbabwe, which he supported with his\n\nown affidavit and reports from human rights organizations, the\n\nUnited States government, and the press.                Rather, the BIA's only\n\nexplanation for its rejection of Smith's changed country conditions\n\nevidence was that neither the evidence of attacks against his\n\nfamily nor of increased violence against opposition activists\n\n\"indicate[s] that conditions have deteriorated or otherwise changed\n\nfor   individuals       like   [Smith]    who   were    politically     active   in\n\nZimbabwe so long ago\" or \"who [were] not even present in Zimbabwe\n\nin April 2008\" and did not vote in the elections that were held\n\nthat year.    In effect, the BIA seems to conclude that Smith had not\n\nmade a showing of a material change in country conditions primarily\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fbecause he was not in Zimbabwe to experience the changed conditions\n\nthat he describes.\n\n           This is an untenable construction of the changed country\n\nconditions requirement.         By the BIA's logic, Smith would need to\n\nshow that he himself had been present in Zimbabwe during the rise\n\nin persecution of opposition activists and the attacks against his\n\nfamily in order for those changes in country conditions to be\n\nconsidered material to him.          In so holding, the BIA essentially\n\nwould require a petitioner who, by definition,7 has not resided in\n\na country during the relevant change in conditions, to show that he\n\nwas present in the country, engaged in political activity there\n\nduring   the    period    of   change,   and   experienced   personally     the\n\nviolence endured by his family.          Such a rule of materiality is both\n\nlogically unsound and incorrect as a matter of law, and we can find\n\nno support for such a rule in our case law.\n\n           To    the     contrary,   numerous    cases   establish   that    a\n\npetitioner who had previously been politically active in his home\n\ncountry may successfully show that conditions have materially\n\n\n\n     7\n       The exception to the ninety-day time limit for filing a\nmotion to reopen applies if the basis of the motion is \"to reopen\ndeportation or removal proceedings . . . [and is] based on changed\ncircumstances arising in the country of nationality.\" 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1003.2(c)(2)&(c)(3)(ii). Both asylum and withholding of removal\nare relevant only to aliens who are already in the United States.\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) (\"Any alien who is physically present in\nthe United States or who arrives in the United States . . .\nirrespective of such alien's status, may apply for asylum.\"); 8\nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A).\n\n                                     -14-\n\fchanged when an opposition political party comes to power and\n\nbegins persecuting supporters of the petitioner's party.                         See,\n\ne.g., Shardar v. Attorney General, 503 F.3d 308, 314-15 (3d Cir.\n\n2007) (finding materially changed country conditions for former\n\nlocal   leader    of   a   political    party     when    the   opposition      party\n\nregained power and began abusing those holding the petitioner's\n\npolitical opinions (citing In re Hossin, A70 907 367 (BIA Jan. 27,\n\n2003) (unpublished))); Habchy v. Filip, 552 F.3d 911, 913-15 (8th\n\nCir. 2009) (finding BIA erred in failing to consider materially\n\nchanged country conditions for petitioner, a Lebanese man who had\n\nyears   earlier    been    accused   by    Hizballah      of    being    an   Israeli\n\ncollaborator, who submitted reports showing upswing in violence\n\nagainst supporters of Israel by Hizballah in Lebanon); Kebe v.\n\nGonzales, 473 F.3d 855, 858 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding that Ethiopian\n\nwho had been imprisoned and beaten because of his opposition\n\npolitical    party     affiliation        while    living       in   Ethiopia     had\n\npotentially demonstrated materially changed country conditions when\n\nhe submitted human rights reports and news articles showing that\n\nviolence    against    opposition      groups     had    increased      in    Ethiopia\n\nsurrounding elections in 2005); cf. Larngar v. Holder, 562 F.3d 71,\n\n77 (1st Cir. 2009) (finding that the rise to power in Liberia of an\n\nenemy of the petitioner, a Liberian man who had resided in the\n\nUnited States for almost thirty years, was a material change in\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fcountry conditions).8\n\n          The case law also shows that recent violence against a\n\npetitioner's family members can constitute a material change in\n\ncountry conditions for a petitioner seeking to reopen his or her\n\nremoval proceedings.    For example, in Malty v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d\n\n942 (9th Cir. 2004), the Ninth Circuit found that a petitioner who\n\n\"submitted   a   declaration   detailing   six   separate   incidents   of\n\npersecution of his family members in Egypt -- all of which occurred\n\nsubsequent to his asylum hearing\" -- had successfully shown a\n\nmaterial change in country conditions.       Id. at 945-46.    The court\n\nfound not only that the beatings of his relatives constituted\n\nchanged country conditions, but also that the petitioner had\n\n\"demonstrated    a   pattern   and   practice    of   persecutions\"     by\n\nintroducing evidence of \"beatings, arrests, and threats[] against\n\nhis similarly situated family members.\"          Id. at 948; see also\n\nAnaneh-Firempong v. INS, 766 F.2d 621, 626 (1st Cir. 1985) (Breyer,\n\nJ.) (finding that petitioner's evidence of \"the house arrest of her\n\nparents, the beating of her nephew, the seizure of the family's\n\nbank account, [and] the persecution of petitioner's tribe, social\n\nclass, and political persuasion\" supported her asylum claim).\n\n\n     8\n      Of course, in some cases it might be appropriate to focus on\nthe length of time between a petitioner's experience in his home\ncountry and his reopening proceedings in determining whether\nclaimed changes within the country are material to that person.\nThat a petitioner was not in the country during claimed changes\ncannot, however, be a per se bar to the materiality of those\nchanges to the petitioner.\n\n                                  -16-\n\f           Given     the    primary    discernable       basis    for   the   BIA's\n\nrejection of Smith's changed country conditions claim -- the\n\nviolence   against    his    family    and    the   rise    in   persecution     of\n\nopposition activists did not relate to him because he was not in\n\nthe country to experience them -- the BIA misapplied the standard\n\nof materiality in assessing Smith's evidence of a change in country\n\nconditions. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); see also Fergiste v. INS,\n\n138 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1998) (finding error in the BIA's\n\ndetermination that general changes in conditions in a petitioner's\n\nhome country rebutted his presumptive fear of future persecution\n\nbecause the BIA did not \"discuss how or whether [petitioner's]\n\nparticular   situation      may   be   affected     by    the    changed   country\n\nconditions that it recognized\").         In finding that Smith's evidence\n\nwas not material to his own fear of future persecution, the BIA\n\nabused its discretion.9\n\n\n     9\n       We note that the government's argument that any escalation\nof violence in Zimbabwe is a mere continuation of existing patterns\nseems to have been rejected by the BIA.        The BIA found that\n\"evidence that state-sponsored abuse of opposition activists in\nZimbabwe has increased in the last few years does not reflect\nmaterially changed country conditions for the respondent\" because\nhis activism took place many years earlier. In so finding, the BIA\nimplicitly rejected the proposition that the increase in violence\nwas nothing but a continuation of existing conditions, instead\nfinding that a change had occurred, but that it was not material to\nSmith. The BIA was correct to reject the government's argument.\nThe record shows, among other things, a tripling of the incidents\nof ZANU-PF-sponsored torture from 2006 to 2007 and the inception of\nviolent campaigns by ZANU-PF militia associated with the unrest\nbrought on by the 2008 elections. Such conditions certainly meet\nthe standard we have enunciated -- namely, that evidence must\n\"demonstrate the intensification or deterioration of country\n\n                                       -17-\n\fB. Prima Facie Showing\n\n           In order to establish eligibility for asylum, one of the\n\nforms of underlying relief sought by Smith, \"an applicant must\n\ndemonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one of\n\nfive enumerated grounds, namely, 'race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.'\"\n\nRaza, 484 F.3d at 128-29 (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2)(i)(A)).10\n\nThe   applicant   may   meet   this   burden   either   by   proving   past\n\npersecution, which gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of future\n\npersecution, or by \"showing that (a) the alien genuinely fears such\n\npersecution and (b) an objectively reasonable person in the alien's\n\ncircumstances would fear such persecution.\"             Mendez-Barrera v.\n\nHolder, 602 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n\n\n\nconditions, not their mere continuation.\" Tawadrous v. Holder, 565\nF.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir. 2009).\n      10\n        Because the analysis in this section centers on the\nanalytical framework for evaluating whether a prima facie case has\nbeen made on a motion to reopen, rather than on the substance of\nthe prima facie case, it applies with equal force to the three\nsubstantive grounds on which Smith seeks relief: asylum,\nwithholding of removal, and CAT protection. See Abudu, 485 U.S. at\n99 n.3 (\"[T]he standard for granting reopening . . . is the same\nfor both asylum and withholding of deportation requests.\"). To\navoid redundancy, we conduct the analysis only once, with reference\nto Smith's asylum claim. See id. (noting that the analysis in that\ncase was conducted for asylum claim only because it would apply to\nwithholding claim as well and because \"it is easier to prove well-\nfounded fear of persecution than clear probability of persecution\"\nas required for withholding of removal).    On remand, the BIA will\nneed to consider all three of Smith's substantive grounds for\nreopening.\n\n                                  -18-\n\f          To make a prima facie case for asylum in the context of\n\na motion to reopen, \"the applicant need only produce objective\n\nevidence showing a 'reasonable likelihood'\" that he will face\n\nfuture persecution based on a statutory ground.   Larngar, 562 F.3d\n\nat 78 (quoting Sevoian v. Ashcroft, 290 F.3d 166, 175 (3d Cir.\n\n2002)).   A \"reasonable likelihood\" means \"showing a realistic\n\nchance that the petitioner can at a later time establish that\n\nasylum should be granted.\"    Guo v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 556, 564 (3d\n\nCir. 2004).    To make a showing of either past persecution or a\n\nlikelihood of future persecution, \"an applicant's testimony, if\n\ncredible, may be sufficient.\"    Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 19 (citing 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(a)).\n\n          Smith asserts that he is eligible for asylum because he\n\nhas a well-founded fear of persecution based on his political\n\naffiliation.   He argues that his past persecution at the hands of\n\nthe ZANU-PF contributes to his fear of future persecution. He also\n\ncites more recent events to support his claim that he will face\n\npersecution if returned.     As described in detail earlier in this\n\nopinion, his prima facie case consists of evidence of his beatings\n\nby the ZANU-PF when he was a student in Zimbabwe, the recent\n\nescalation of violence against opposition activists, the recent\n\nviolent persecution of Smith's family by the government, and the\n\nhostile treatment of failed asylum seekers when they are returned\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fto Zimbabwe, all of which combine to give him a well-founded fear\n\nof persecution if he is sent back to Zimbabwe.\n\n            The BIA gave two primary reasons for its determination\n\nthat Smith had not made a prima facie case for asylum.             First, it\n\nfound that evidence of Smith's past mistreatment \"does not warrant\n\nreopening because it could have been presented at the former\n\nhearing before the Immigration Judge.\"            Turning to Smith's new\n\nevidence showing the targeting of his family, the increase in\n\nstate-sponsored      abuse    of     opposition    activists,      and   the\n\ninterrogation and mistreatment of deportees, the BIA found that\n\neach additional piece of evidence, \"standing alone,\" did not \"make\n\na   prima   facie   showing   that   the    respondent   himself   may   face\n\npersecution on account of a protected ground under the Act.\"11\n\n\n      11\n       In its short order, the BIA used the \"standing alone\" phrase\nthree times:\n          (1) \"The mere fact that the respondent's\n          family was targeted for living in a [certain\n          area] and attacked following the April 2008\n          elections, standing alone, does not make a\n          prima facie showing that the respondent\n          himself may face persecution . . . .\"\n          (2) \"[E]vidence that state-sponsored abuse of\n          opposition activists in Zimbabwe has increased\n          in the last few years, standing alone, does\n          not    reflect   material     changed    country\n          conditions for the respondent . . . .\"\n          (3) \"[T]he fact that the respondent may be\n          interrogated   and    subject    to   background\n          scrutiny by the CIO upon his repatriation\n          because he is returning from the United\n          States, standing alone, is insufficient to\n          make a prima facie showing that the respondent\n          may   be   subject   to   harm    amounting   to\n          persecution . . . .\"\n\n                                     -20-\n\f             There are two flaws in this reasoning.             First, the BIA\n\nevaluated each piece of evidence in isolation to determine if it\n\nalone was enough to establish a prima facie case.               That is clearly\n\nerror.     The BIA must consider the material evidence as a whole when\n\nassessing a petitioner's prima facie showing, rather than taking\n\neach individual piece and looking at it \"standing alone.\"12\n\n             Second, the BIA erred in refusing to consider Smith's\n\nclaim of past persecution as part of his prima facie showing.                   On\n\na   motion   to    reopen,    an   alien   must   both   introduce     material,\n\npreviously unavailable evidence and make a prima facie showing of\n\neligibility       for   the   underlying     relief   sought.      8   C.F.R.    §\n\n\n\n(emphasis added).\n      12\n        In order to provide guidance on remand, we note three\nadditional errors in the BIA's treatment of Smith's claim involving\nhis status as a failed asylum seeker that, in and of themselves, do\nnot constitute grounds for a remand. First, the BIA relied on a\nregulation providing for confidentiality of asylum proceedings in\nconcluding that Smith would not be identified as a failed asylum\nseeker by the CIO upon return to Zimbabwe.          The regulation\ngoverning asylum proceedings, however, does not address Smith's\ncontention that he would be escorted by the government to Zimbabwe\nand thus easily identified as a returnee from the United States.\nAlthough the government presumably would have access to information\nabout the relevant deportation procedures, the record contains no\nevidence contradicting Smith's claim. The BIA's conclusion that\nthe evidence from the United Kingdom was \"immaterial\" to Smith is\nthus unsupported by any evidence in the record. Second, as noted,\nthe BIA insisted on reviewing in isolation Smith's contention that\nhe would face interrogation on return to Zimbabwe. Finally, the\nBIA's conclusion that evidence that the Zimbabwean government views\nthe United States' political stance with suspicion \"does not\nnecessarily mean\" that Smith may face persecution is incompatible\nwith the \"reasonable likelihood\" requirement that applies to a\nmotion to reopen.\n\n                                      -21-\n\f1003.2(c)(1).   These requirements do not mean, however, that the\n\nBIA is limited to considering evidence that was unavailable at the\n\nprior hearing when it determines whether a petitioner has made a\n\nprima facie case for the relief sought.   \"'[P]rima facie' scrutiny\n\nof a motion to reopen means an evaluation of the evidence that\n\naccompanies the motion as well as relevant evidence that may exist\n\nin the record of the prior hearing, in light of the applicable\n\nstatutory requirements for relief.\"    Sevoian, 290 F.3d at 173; see\n\nalso In re L-O-G-, 21 I. & N. Dec. 413, 419 (BIA June 14, 1996) (en\n\nbanc) (\"[W]e have been willing to reopen 'where the new facts\n\nalleged, when coupled with the facts already of record, satisfy us\n\nthat it would be worthwhile to develop the issues further at a\n\nplenary hearing on reopening.'\" (quoting In re Sipus, 14 I. & N.\n\nDec. 229, 231 (BIA Nov. 10, 1972))).    Because a petitioner filing\n\na motion to reopen must produce new, material evidence, it follows\n\nthat the prima facie showing will always include some new evidence.\n\nThat showing does not, however, need to be made entirely through\n\nnew evidence.   Instead, it may be based on the new evidence coupled\n\nwith \"the facts already of record.\"    In re L-O-G-, 21 I. & N. Dec.\n\nat 419.   In other words, although previously available evidence of\n\npast persecution cannot be the sole basis for reopening, it may be\n\nrelevant to the petitioner's prima facie case for asylum.    Norani\n\nv. Gonzales, 451 F.3d 292, 295 n.6 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f            The principle that previously available evidence may be\n\nconsidered part of the prima facie showing on a motion to reopen\n\napplies with equal force to a petitioner like Smith who seeks to\n\nreopen proceedings to make his first application for asylum.13\n\nAlthough the record contains no evidence previously submitted in\n\nsupport of his asylum claim, prima facie scrutiny of his motion to\n\nreopen    must    nonetheless   include     an   evaluation   of   all    of    the\n\ncurrently    available     evidence.      Norani,    451   F.3d    at    295   n.6\n\n(\"[E]vents from [a petitioner's] past are relevant to [his] present\n\nasylum application even though [he] previously [did not] apply for\n\nasylum based solely on these events.\").\n\n            In     refusing   to   consider      Smith's   evidence      of    past\n\npersecution as part of his prima facie case, the BIA conflated\n\nSmith's burden to make a prima facie showing of eligibility for\n\nrelief with the requirement that he produce previously unavailable\n\nevidence in order to justify reopening.                That conflation was\n\nerroneous.       See Abudu, 485 U.S. at 108-09 (holding that it would be\n\nerror for an appellate court to \"conflate[] the quite separate\n\nissues whether the alien has presented a prima facie case for\n\n\n\n\n     13\n       The relevant regulation permits a motion to reopen in which\na petitioner seeks asylum for the first time under either of two\nconditions: (1) if a petitioner's \"right to apply for such relief\"\nwas not \"fully explained to him\" and an \"opportunity to apply\" was\nnot \"afforded at the former hearing,\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1), or\n(2) if a petitioner applies \"on the basis of circumstances that\nhave arisen subsequent to the hearing.\" Id.\n\n                                     -23-\n\fasylum      with    whether    the     alien     has   .    .    .     offered      previously\n\nunavailable, material evidence\").\n\n              This circuit has not previously had occasion to enunciate\n\nthis principle.             We have indicated that the two burdens are\n\nseparate.          See, e.g., Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 20 (citing the two\n\n\"threshold requirements for a motion to reopen: that it establish\n\na prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought and\n\nthat   it    introduce       previously      unavailable,             material      evidence.\"\n\n(internal      quotation       marks      omitted)).            But    we    have    also,   on\n\noccasion, seemed to sanction the conflation of the new evidence\n\nrequirement with the prima facie case requirement.                                  See, e.g.,\n\nChikkeur v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 1381, 1383 (1st Cir. 2008) (stating,\n\nin   dicta,    that    \"[a]     motion      to    reopen        must    be   denied     unless\n\npetitioners' new evidence establishes a prima facie case for the\n\nunderlying substantive relief\"); Tandayu, 521 F.3d at 100 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).      Abudu makes clear that the requirements are distinct. 485\n\nU.S. at 108-09 & n. 13.                Any suggestion to the contrary in our\n\nopinions was legally incorrect.                  Id.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n              The BIA made three primary legal errors in addressing\n\nSmith's      motion    to     reopen.        First,        it    applied      an     incorrect\n\nmateriality requirement in assessing Smith's evidence of changed\n\ncountry      conditions       when   it    rejected        his    evidence         of   changed\n\nconditions because he was not in Zimbabwe to experience the changes\n\n\n                                            -24-\n\fthat he describes.           Second, it evaluated Smith's evidence in\n\nsupport of his prima facie case piece by piece, rather than\n\nconsidering    the    material      evidence       as   a   whole.       Finally,     it\n\nconflated    Smith's       burden    to    make    a    prima   facie      showing    of\n\neligibility    for    relief      with    the     requirement     that     he   produce\n\npreviously unavailable evidence in order to justify reopening,\n\nthereby failing to consider his evidence of past persecution in\n\nassessing his prima facie case. Because these errors prevented the\n\nBIA   from   applying      the    correct    legal      standards     to    the   facts\n\npresented in Smith's motion to reopen, we remand this matter to the\n\nBIA so that it can consider, consistent with this opinion, whether\n\nSmith has established a change in country conditions that would\n\nexcuse his late filing and, if so, whether he has made out a prima\n\nfacie case of eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or\n\nprotection under the CAT.14              See, e.g., Larngar, 562 F.3d at 80\n\n(remanding    to     the    BIA     to    consider      whether      petitioner      had\n\nestablished a change in country circumstances and, if so, made out\n\na prima facie case of eligibility); Ananeh-Firempong, 766 F.2d at\n\n629 (remanding to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with\n\n\n\n\n      14\n        Given our disposition, we need not address Smith's\nadditional contention that he was denied a fair opportunity to\ncomply with the procedural requirements for the maintenance of an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, as set forth in Matter of\nLozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA April 13, 1988).\n\n                                          -25-\n\fthe opinion after finding that the BIA abused its discretion in\n\nrefusing to reopen petitioner's deportation proceeding).15\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n         Although the BIA's denial of Smith's motion for\nreconsideration was not before us (he did not appeal that denial),\nwe note that the BIA's denial referenced the failure of Smith to\nsubmit certain affidavits and other documents. On remand, the BIA\nhas the authority to allow Smith to submit this additional\ninformation. We also note that the BIA may consider, relevant to\nboth the issue of changed conditions and Smith's prima facie case,\nthat there is at least one later State Department report that\nincidents of ZANU-PF-sponsored torture rose more than five-fold\nfrom 2006 to 2008.\n\n                              -26-\n\f",

This published opinion has been redacted to\nremove any identifying information. The original opinion remains\nunder seal.\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Petitioner John Smith seeks review\n\nof a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his\n\nmotion to reopen his removal proceedings so that he could apply for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT).    In his motion, Smith cited changed country\n\nconditions and new evidence that was unavailable to him during the\n\nproceedings on his initial application for adjustment of status.\n\nBecause we conclude that the BIA committed errors of law in\n\ndeciding that Smith had not shown changed country conditions or\n\nmade a prima facie case for relief, thereby abusing its discretion,\n\nwe grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           The evidence presented by Smith is fairly summarized as\n\nfollows.   Smith was born in Zimbabwe.    He is from a large family\n\nand his parents worked.   He became an active member of the Zimbabwe\n\nNational Students Union (ZINAZU), an organization that was opposed\n\nto the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU-PF) government then in\n\npower in Zimbabwe.   Smith held a position in ZINAZU and also joined\n\nthe Zimbabwe Unity Movement, a political movement seeking to unseat\n\nZANU-PF in the 1990 general election.    He had a leadership role in\n\nthat organization.   As a result of his political activities, Smith\n\nwas arrested and detained multiple times, first in the early 1990s,\n\nagain a few years later, and finally a few years after that.     On\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fall three occasions, he was beaten severely and threatened with\n\nfurther harm to himself and his family.\n\n                After his last, most severe detention and beating,\n\nSmith decided to leave Zimbabwe in an act of self-preservation. He\n\nentered the United States in the mid-1990s on a visa.          He attended\n\na college and then a university and earned a degree.          Smith worked\n\nfor two years as an environmental design engineer before becoming\n\na civil engineer with a firm in the United States, where he worked\n\nuntil several years ago.        During those years, he continued to\n\npursue his education.     In 2003, he earned a graduate degree from a\n\nuniversity.     From 2004 to 2007, he again attended a university he\n\nhad previously attended while he worked towards a second graduate\n\ndegree.\n\nA. Adjustment of Status\n\n           In the late 1990s, Smith married Sarah Jones, an American\n\ncitizen, with whom he later had a son, also named John.1         Smith and\n\nJones sought to adjust his immigration status based on their\n\nmarriage   by   filing   an   I-130   visa   petition   and   applying   for\n\nadjustment of Smith's immigration status.        Smith's application for\n\nadjustment of status was initially denied when Jones withdrew her\n\nsupport, but was reopened sometime in the early 2000s after Jones\n\nfiled another I-130 visa petition on Smith's behalf.               Smith's\n\n\n\n     1\n      The marriage ended after seven years, in 2006, the same year\nJohn was born.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fsecond application was also denied in the mid-2000s, after a\n\nhearing before an immigration judge.             Although the immigration\n\njudge found Smith to be credible and that his marriage was bona\n\nfide, she cited Jones's failure to appear in support of Smith in\n\nrefusing to adjust his status. The immigration judge granted Smith\n\nvoluntary departure with an alternate order of removal to Zimbabwe.\n\nSmith's appeal of that decision was dismissed by the BIA.                  In a\n\nbrief   opinion,     the   BIA   stated   that     the    outcome    was    \"an\n\nunderstandable and appropriate exercise of the Immigration Judge's\n\ndiscretion to deny adjustment of status.\"\n\nB. Motion to Reopen\n\n            In the late 2000s, more than a year after his appeal was\n\ndismissed, Smith filed a pro se motion to reopen his removal\n\nproceedings with the BIA so that he could apply for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and CAT protection.            In the motion, Smith\n\nstated that he feared being persecuted and tortured if returned to\n\nZimbabwe.     That    argument   was   based,     in    part,   on   his   past\n\npersecution by the reigning ZANU-PF regime.            As required to excuse\n\nhis failure to file a motion to reopen within the ninety-day\n\nstatutory window, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), Smith argued\n\nthat in the time since the BIA dismissed his appeal in the mid-\n\n2000s, conditions in Zimbabwe had changed dramatically for the\n\nworse for those who, like him, had been active opponents of the\n\nZANU-PF or whose families had been labeled as opposition.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            In support of his motion to reopen, Smith submitted an\n\naffidavit    describing     his   earlier     persecution       for   his    earlier\n\nactivism    against   the   ZANU-PF.         He    also    detailed   more    recent\n\nviolence against his family in Zimbabwe.2                 According to Smith, his\n\nfamily has been harassed, intimidated, and physically attacked for\n\nallegedly    sympathizing     with   neighboring           white   farmers.       He\n\ndescribed two violent attacks in the mid-2000s, one in which his\n\nfather was attacked violently, and another in which a cousin who\n\nlived with close family was killed by the ZANU-PF youth militia.\n\nIn the late 2000s, the family was targeted once again for its\n\npolitical    sympathies.      The    April        2008    elections   in    Zimbabwe\n\nresulted in the withdrawal of the candidate of the opposition,\n\nMovement for Democratic Change (MDC), due to ZANU-PF-directed\n\nviolence that made it impossible to conduct a free and fair\n\nelection.     According to Smith, his family did not vote in the\n\nelections. Nevertheless, shortly after the election, ZANU-PF youth\n\nmilitia invaded Smith's parents' home in retaliation for the heavy\n\nsupport the MDC received in the elections in the area where they\n\nlived.      The family's home was destroyed and his family members\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       By way of background, Smith made a public statement\nregarding his political views of the Zimbabwe regime while in the\nUnited States. The public statement was seen in Zimbabwe and his\nclose family then contacted him to let him know that his actions\nwere extremely dangerous for family still in Zimbabwe.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fwere attacked.         Another individual was killed.               Smith's family\n\nmembers escaped to another country.3\n\n              Smith also submitted evidence that failed asylum seekers\n\nwho   were    returned    to    Zimbabwe    were     being   subjected      to    harsh\n\ninterrogation by the government's Central Intelligence Organization\n\n(CIO).    He included a judicial opinion from the United Kingdom in\n\nwhich the court concluded, based on extensive testimony, that\n\nbecause      failed    asylum    applicants     are    not     channeled     to    the\n\nimmigration authorities, but are instead immediately screened and\n\ninterrogated      by     the    central    intelligence      arm,    they    face    a\n\nheightened risk of physical violence.               The court made this finding\n\nafter hearing credible testimony that beatings are \"a systemic\n\nfeature of a CIO investigation,\" particularly for opponents of the\n\nZANU-PF.\n\n              Finally,    Smith's    motion     to    reopen    included     country\n\nreports and other documents showing that both government and non-\n\ngovernmental organization observers agreed that human rights abuses\n\nby the ZANU-PF were worsening in Zimbabwe.                   For example, a U.S.\n\nState Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices in\n\nZimbabwe shows, among other things, that ZANU-PF-sponsored torture\n\nin Zimbabwe increased almost threefold between 2006 and 2007 (from\n\n1,185 incidents to 3,463 incidents).               The State Department reports\n\n\n      3\n       Several days before the BIA ruled on his motion to reopen,\na close family member of Smith's was killed after returning to\nZimbabwe.\n\n                                          -6-\n\falso   describe   a     \"systematic       government-sponsored     campaign     to\n\ndismantle the opposition party's structures\" prior to the 2008\n\nelections through violence directed at supporters, expulsion of\n\nvillagers who supported the MDC, and withholding of government-\n\nsupplied food aid from MDC supporters.              A 2006 report from Human\n\nRights Watch concluded, similarly, that \"[v]iolent repression of\n\ncivil society activists by state authorities in Zimbabwe continues\n\nto escalate.\"\n\nC. The BIA's Order\n\n           The BIA denied Smith's motion to reopen, concluding that\n\nit was not timely because it had not been filed within ninety days\n\nof the final decision on his application for adjustment of status,\n\nas required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).            Although recognizing that\n\nthere is an exception to the ninety-day time limit for motions to\n\nreopen where an alien is seeking asylum and withholding of removal\n\nbased on changed circumstances in the country of nationality or the\n\ncountry   to   which    removal     has    been   ordered,   see   8   C.F.R.    §\n\n1003.2(c)(3)(ii), the BIA found that Smith had not demonstrated\n\n\"that conditions have materially changed for him in Zimbabwe.\"\n\n           The    BIA    rejected     Smith's     claim   that   conditions     in\n\nZimbabwe worsened for opposition supporters before and after the\n\n2008 elections.       The Board found that \"[e]vidence that the ZANU-PF\n\nhas been abusing individuals who voted for the MDC in the April\n\n2008 elections is immaterial to [Smith]\" because \"he was not even\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fpresent in Zimbabwe\" during the elections and does not claim to\n\nhave voted in them. The BIA dismissed Smith's evidence of violence\n\nagainst his family, noting \"the mere fact that [Smith's] family was\n\ntargeted . . . standing alone, does not make a prima facie showing\n\nthat the respondent himself may face persecution on account of a\n\nprotected ground under the Act or torture upon his repatriation.\"\n\n           Similarly, the BIA reasoned that evidence that \"state-\n\nsponsored abuse of opposition activists in Zimbabwe has increased\n\nin the last few years, standing alone, does not reflect material\n\n[sic] changed country conditions for the respondent.\"          The BIA\n\nfound that Smith had not identified \"evidence that would indicate\n\nthat   conditions   have   deteriorated   or   otherwise   changed   for\n\nindividuals like himself who were politically active in Zimbabwe so\n\nlong ago.\"\n\n           Finally, the Board rejected the evidence Smith introduced\n\nshowing that Britain had granted asylum to a Zimbabwean national\n\nbecause of the danger to rejected asylum seekers who are returned\n\nto Zimbabwe.   The BIA called that information \"immaterial to the\n\nrespondent\" because he would not be removed \"under that process.\"\n\nThe BIA asserted that Smith's claim was also \"speculative\" because\n\n\"United States-based asylum proceedings are required by law . . .\n\nto remain confidential.\"      The BIA noted that the fact that the\n\nZANU-PF government is suspicious of the United States \"does not\n\nnecessarily mean that [Smith] may face persecution and torture upon\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fhis removal.\"     Again, the BIA found that \"standing alone,\" Smith's\n\nevidence was \"insufficient to make a prima facie showing\" that he\n\nmay be subject to persecution if returned to Zimbabwe.4\n\n             Smith filed this timely petition seeking review of the\n\nBoard's denial of his motion to reopen.\n\n                                          II.\n\n             The BIA has jurisdiction over motions to reopen removal\n\nproceedings     under    8   C.F.R.   §    1003.2(a).   We,   in   turn,   have\n\njurisdiction over Smith's petition for review under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252.       See Neves v.

While the first\n\nquestion goes to Smith's procedural right to bring his motion to\n\nreopen, the second goes to the merits of his claim.     We conclude\n\nthat the decision of the BIA, which answered both questions in the\n\nnegative, was based on legal error; thus, the BIA abused its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f          There   are   both   substantive   and   procedural   bars   to\n\nreopening removal proceedings. Substantively, federal regulations\n\ncreate two \"threshold requirements for a motion to reopen: that it\n\nestablish 'a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief\n\nsought' and that it introduce 'previously unavailable, material\n\nevidence.'\"   Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 20 (quoting INS v.

The BIA\n\nmay deny a petition if it determines that the movant has failed to\n\nmeet either of those requirements.      In addition, the BIA may \"leap\n\nahead, as it were, over the two threshold concerns (prima facie\n\ncase and new evidence/reasonable explanation), and simply determine\n\nthat even if they were met, the movant would not be entitled to the\n\ndiscretionary grant of relief.\"     Abudu, 485 U.S. at 105.\n\n          Procedurally, a petitioner is limited to \"a single motion\n\nto reopen a removal proceeding\" which must be \"submitted within\n\nninety days of the rendition of the final administrative decision.\"\n\nRaza v.

Changed Country Conditions\n\n            Smith brought his motion to reopen more than ninety days\n\nafter the Board's final administrative decision. Because he missed\n\nthe ninety-day procedural window for filing his motion, Smith must\n\ndemonstrate changed conditions in his homeland that are material to\n\nhis claim of eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nCAT protection.

That holding would place the relevant date for Smith's\nnew evidence in the mid-2000s. We need not determine here which\ndate applies, as the increase in violence against opposition\nsupporters and the violence against Smith's family occurred after\nboth dates.\n\n                                   -12-\n\frights   abuses,        particularly     directed      at    supporters     of   the\n\nopposition to the ZANU-PF government, have, in Smith's words, gone\n\nfrom \"general but not systematic\" to \"general, pervasive and\n\nsystematic.\"      Incidences of ZANU-PF-sponsored torture essentially\n\ntripled from 2006 to 2007.          In particular, the ZANU-PF government\n\ntargets those it suspects of supporting the opposition party.\n\nViolence of that nature struck Smith's family at that time, when\n\nhis cousin was murdered and his father was attacked violently, and\n\nagain a few years later, when the family members were driven from\n\ntheir property in a ward that had heavily supported the opposition\n\nin the 2008 elections.\n\n             In   its    opinion,    the    BIA   did       not   dispute   Smith's\n\nassessment of conditions in Zimbabwe, which he supported with his\n\nown affidavit and reports from human rights organizations, the\n\nUnited States government, and the press.                Rather, the BIA's only\n\nexplanation for its rejection of Smith's changed country conditions\n\nevidence was that neither the evidence of attacks against his\n\nfamily nor of increased violence against opposition activists\n\n\"indicate[s] that conditions have deteriorated or otherwise changed\n\nfor   individuals       like   [Smith]    who   were    politically     active   in\n\nZimbabwe so long ago\" or \"who [were] not even present in Zimbabwe\n\nin April 2008\" and did not vote in the elections that were held\n\nthat year.    In effect, the BIA seems to conclude that Smith had not\n\nmade a showing of a material change in country conditions primarily\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fbecause he was not in Zimbabwe to experience the changed conditions\n\nthat he describes.\n\n           This is an untenable construction of the changed country\n\nconditions requirement.         By the BIA's logic, Smith would need to\n\nshow that he himself had been present in Zimbabwe during the rise\n\nin persecution of opposition activists and the attacks against his\n\nfamily in order for those changes in country conditions to be\n\nconsidered material to him.          In so holding, the BIA essentially\n\nwould require a petitioner who, by definition,7 has not resided in\n\na country during the relevant change in conditions, to show that he\n\nwas present in the country, engaged in political activity there\n\nduring   the    period    of   change,   and   experienced   personally     the\n\nviolence endured by his family.          Such a rule of materiality is both\n\nlogically unsound and incorrect as a matter of law, and we can find\n\nno support for such a rule in our case law.\n\n           To    the     contrary,   numerous    cases   establish   that    a\n\npetitioner who had previously been politically active in his home\n\ncountry may successfully show that conditions have materially\n\n\n\n     7\n       The exception to the ninety-day time limit for filing a\nmotion to reopen applies if the basis of the motion is \"to reopen\ndeportation or removal proceedings . . .

See Abudu, 485 U.S. at\n99 n.3 (\"[T]he standard for granting reopening . . . is the same\nfor both asylum and withholding of deportation requests.\"). To\navoid redundancy, we conduct the analysis only once, with reference\nto Smith's asylum claim. See id.

He argues that his past persecution at the hands of\n\nthe ZANU-PF contributes to his fear of future persecution. He also\n\ncites more recent events to support his claim that he will face\n\npersecution if returned.     As described in detail earlier in this\n\nopinion, his prima facie case consists of evidence of his beatings\n\nby the ZANU-PF when he was a student in Zimbabwe, the recent\n\nescalation of violence against opposition activists, the recent\n\nviolent persecution of Smith's family by the government, and the\n\nhostile treatment of failed asylum seekers when they are returned\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fto Zimbabwe, all of which combine to give him a well-founded fear\n\nof persecution if he is sent back to Zimbabwe.\n\n            The BIA gave two primary reasons for its determination\n\nthat Smith had not made a prima facie case for asylum.             First, it\n\nfound that evidence of Smith's past mistreatment \"does not warrant\n\nreopening because it could have been presented at the former\n\nhearing before the Immigration Judge.\"            Turning to Smith's new\n\nevidence showing the targeting of his family, the increase in\n\nstate-sponsored      abuse    of     opposition    activists,      and   the\n\ninterrogation and mistreatment of deportees, the BIA found that\n\neach additional piece of evidence, \"standing alone,\" did not \"make\n\na   prima   facie   showing   that   the    respondent   himself   may   face\n\npersecution on account of a protected ground under the Act.\"11\n\n\n      11\n       In its short order, the BIA used the \"standing alone\" phrase\nthree times:\n          (1) \"The mere fact that the respondent's\n          family was targeted for living in a [certain\n          area] and attacked following the April 2008\n          elections, standing alone, does not make a\n          prima facie showing that the respondent\n          himself may face persecution . . . .\"\n          (2) \"[E]vidence that state-sponsored abuse of\n          opposition activists in Zimbabwe has increased\n          in the last few years, standing alone, does\n          not    reflect   material     changed    country\n          conditions for the respondent . . . .\"\n          (3) \"[T]he fact that the respondent may be\n          interrogated   and    subject    to   background\n          scrutiny by the CIO upon his repatriation\n          because he is returning from the United\n          States, standing alone, is insufficient to\n          make a prima facie showing that the respondent\n          may   be   subject   to   harm    amounting   to\n          persecution . . . .\"\n\n                                     -20-\n\f             There are two flaws in this reasoning.             First, the BIA\n\nevaluated each piece of evidence in isolation to determine if it\n\nalone was enough to establish a prima facie case.               That is clearly\n\nerror.     The BIA must consider the material evidence as a whole when\n\nassessing a petitioner's prima facie showing, rather than taking\n\neach individual piece and looking at it \"standing alone.\"12\n\n             Second, the BIA erred in refusing to consider Smith's\n\nclaim of past persecution as part of his prima facie showing.                   On\n\na   motion   to    reopen,    an   alien   must   both   introduce     material,\n\npreviously unavailable evidence and make a prima facie showing of\n\neligibility       for   the   underlying     relief   sought.      8   C.F.R.    §\n\n\n\n(emphasis added).\n      12\n        In order to provide guidance on remand, we note three\nadditional errors in the BIA's treatment of Smith's claim involving\nhis status as a failed asylum seeker that, in and of themselves, do\nnot constitute grounds for a remand. First, the BIA relied on a\nregulation providing for confidentiality of asylum proceedings in\nconcluding that Smith would not be identified as a failed asylum\nseeker by the CIO upon return to Zimbabwe.          The regulation\ngoverning asylum proceedings, however, does not address Smith's\ncontention that he would be escorted by the government to Zimbabwe\nand thus easily identified as a returnee from the United States.\nAlthough the government presumably would have access to information\nabout the relevant deportation procedures, the record contains no\nevidence contradicting Smith's claim. The BIA's conclusion that\nthe evidence from the United Kingdom was \"immaterial\" to Smith is\nthus unsupported by any evidence in the record. Second, as noted,\nthe BIA insisted on reviewing in isolation Smith's contention that\nhe would face interrogation on return to Zimbabwe. Finally, the\nBIA's conclusion that evidence that the Zimbabwean government views\nthe United States' political stance with suspicion \"does not\nnecessarily mean\" that Smith may face persecution is incompatible\nwith the \"reasonable likelihood\" requirement that applies to a\nmotion to reopen.\n\n                                      -21-\n\f1003.2(c)(1).   These requirements do not mean, however, that the\n\nBIA is limited to considering evidence that was unavailable at the\n\nprior hearing when it determines whether a petitioner has made a\n\nprima facie case for the relief sought.   \"'[P]rima facie' scrutiny\n\nof a motion to reopen means an evaluation of the evidence that\n\naccompanies the motion as well as relevant evidence that may exist\n\nin the record of the prior hearing, in light of the applicable\n\nstatutory requirements for relief.\"    Sevoian, 290 F.3d at 173; see\n\nalso In re L-O-G-, 21 I. & N. Dec. 413, 419 (BIA June 14, 1996) (en\n\nbanc) (\"[W]e have been willing to reopen 'where the new facts\n\nalleged, when coupled with the facts already of record, satisfy us\n\nthat it would be worthwhile to develop the issues further at a\n\nplenary hearing on reopening.'\" (quoting In re Sipus, 14 I. & N.\n\nDec. 229, 231 (BIA Nov. 10, 1972))).    Because a petitioner filing\n\na motion to reopen must produce new, material evidence, it follows\n\nthat the prima facie showing will always include some new evidence.\n\nThat showing does not, however, need to be made entirely through\n\nnew evidence.   Instead, it may be based on the new evidence coupled\n\nwith \"the facts already of record.\"    In re L-O-G-, 21 I. & N. Dec.\n\nat 419.   In other words, although previously available evidence of\n\npast persecution cannot be the sole basis for reopening, it may be\n\nrelevant to the petitioner's prima facie case for asylum.

That conflation was\n\nerroneous.       See Abudu, 485 U.S. at 108-09 (holding that it would be\n\nerror for an appellate court to \"conflate[] the quite separate\n\nissues whether the alien has presented a prima facie case for\n\n\n\n\n     13\n       The relevant regulation permits a motion to reopen in which\na petitioner seeks asylum for the first time under either of two\nconditions: (1) if a petitioner's \"right to apply for such relief\"\nwas not \"fully explained to him\" and an \"opportunity to apply\" was\nnot \"afforded at the former hearing,\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1), or\n(2) if a petitioner applies \"on the basis of circumstances that\nhave arisen subsequent to the hearing.\" Id.\n\n                                     -23-\n\fasylum      with    whether    the     alien     has   .    .    .     offered      previously\n\nunavailable, material evidence\").\n\n              This circuit has not previously had occasion to enunciate\n\nthis principle.             We have indicated that the two burdens are\n\nseparate.          See, e.g., Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 20 (citing the two\n\n\"threshold requirements for a motion to reopen: that it establish\n\na prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought and\n\nthat   it    introduce       previously      unavailable,             material      evidence.\"\n\n(internal      quotation       marks      omitted)).            But    we    have    also,   on\n\noccasion, seemed to sanction the conflation of the new evidence\n\nrequirement with the prima facie case requirement.                                  See, e.g.,\n\nChikkeur v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203124\"><a href=\"/opinion/203124/chikkeur-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1383 (1st Cir. 2008) (stating,\n\nin   dicta,    that    \"[a]     motion      to    reopen        must    be   denied     unless\n\npetitioners' new evidence establishes a prima facie case for the\n\nunderlying substantive relief\"); Tandayu, 521 F.3d at 100 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).      Abudu makes clear that the requirements are distinct. 485\n\nU.S. at 108-09 & n. 13.                Any suggestion to the contrary in our\n\nopinions was legally incorrect.                  Id.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n              The BIA made three primary legal errors in addressing\n\nSmith's      motion    to     reopen.        First,        it    applied      an     incorrect\n\nmateriality requirement in assessing Smith's evidence of changed\n\ncountry      conditions       when   it    rejected        his    evidence         of   changed\n\nconditions because he was not in Zimbabwe to experience the changes\n\n\n                                            -24-\n\fthat he describes.           Second, it evaluated Smith's evidence in\n\nsupport of his prima facie case piece by piece, rather than\n\nconsidering    the    material      evidence       as   a   whole.       Finally,     it\n\nconflated    Smith's       burden    to    make    a    prima   facie      showing    of\n\neligibility    for    relief      with    the     requirement     that     he   produce\n\npreviously unavailable evidence in order to justify reopening,\n\nthereby failing to consider his evidence of past persecution in\n\nassessing his prima facie case. Because these errors prevented the\n\nBIA   from   applying      the    correct    legal      standards     to    the   facts\n\npresented in Smith's motion to reopen, we remand this matter to the\n\nBIA so that it can consider, consistent with this opinion, whether\n\nSmith has established a change in country conditions that would\n\nexcuse his late filing and, if so, whether he has made out a prima\n\nfacie case of eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or\n\nprotection under the CAT.14              See, e.g., Larngar, 562 F.3d at 80\n\n(remanding    to     the    BIA     to    consider      whether      petitioner      had\n\nestablished a change in country circumstances and, if so, made out\n\na prima facie case of eligibility); Ananeh-Firempong, 766 F.2d at\n\n629 (remanding to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with\n\n\n\n\n      14\n        Given our disposition, we need not address Smith's\nadditional contention that he was denied a fair opportunity to\ncomply with the procedural requirements for the maintenance of an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, as set forth in Matter of\nLozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA April 13, 1988).\n\n                                          -25-\n\fthe opinion after finding that the BIA abused its discretion in\n\nrefusing to reopen petitioner's deportation proceeding).15\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n         Although the BIA's denial of Smith's motion for\nreconsideration was not before us (he did not appeal that denial),\nwe note that the BIA's denial referenced the failure of Smith to\nsubmit certain affidavits and other documents. On remand, the BIA\nhas the authority to allow Smith to submit this additional\ninformation. We also note that the BIA may consider, relevant to\nboth the issue of changed conditions and Smith's prima facie case,\nthat there is at least one later State Department report that\nincidents of ZANU-PF-sponsored torture rose more than five-fold\nfrom 2006 to 2008.\n\n                              -26-\n\f</pre>",
