Young, Ms. Sarah Thornton, Clerk, United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts, Mr. Katz, Mr.\nSeiger, Ms. Barnett & Mr. Arguin.\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           LYNCH, Chief Judge, dissenting from the denial of en banc\n\nreview. Through AEDPA, Congress has narrowly limited federal court\n\nreview of state criminal convictions. Specifically, federal habeas\n\nrelief is now unavailable to state prisoners unless the state court\n\nadjudication of the prisoner's claim \"resulted in a decision that\n\nwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n\nof the United States.\"         28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n           Here, a Massachusetts jury convicted petitioner Michael\n\nO'Laughlin of several charges relating to the gruesome nighttime\n\nbeating of his neighbor, Annmarie Kotowski, which left her near\n\ndeath.    The    Supreme      Judicial    Court    of    Massachusetts     (\"SJC\")\n\nunanimously upheld that conviction, see Commonwealth v. O'Laughlin\n\n(O'Laughlin     II),    843    N.E.2d    617    (Mass.   2006),    reversing   the\n\nintermediate state appellate court's holding that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient, see Commonwealth v. O'Laughlin (O'Laughlin I), 830\n\nN.E.2d 222 (Mass. App. Ct. 2005).                 The federal district court\n\ndenied O'Laughlin's habeas petition.\n\n           Nonetheless, a panel of this court on federal habeas\n\nreview found that the evidence against O'Laughlin was insufficient\n\nto   support    the    conviction   and    held    that    the    SJC's   contrary\n\ndetermination     was     an     unreasonable       application      of   clearly\n\nestablished federal law.          See O'Laughlin v. O'Brien (O'Laughlin\n\nIII), 568 F.3d 287 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n\n                                        - 2 -\n\f          To   reach   this   result,   the   panel   opinion   applied    a\n\nsufficiency standard that is materially different from the Supreme\n\nCourt's clearly established law under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.\n\n307 (1979), and exceeded its narrowly defined power to review state\n\ncourt criminal convictions under AEDPA.         Because the sufficiency\n\nstandard applied by the panel has consequences well beyond this\n\ncase and the panel's application of that standard to this case\n\nupsets the congressionally defined role of federal habeas review in\n\nour federal system, I respectfully dissent from the denial of en\n\nbanc review.\n\n                                   I.\n\n          Around 2:00 a.m. on November 17, 2000, Kotowski was\n\nseverely beaten in her apartment by an assailant whom she could not\n\nlater identify because of the memory loss she suffered as a result\n\nof the attack.    The assailant nearly killed Kotowski, breaking\n\nalmost every bone in her skull, as well as several in her hands.\n\nThe evidence supported the prosecution's theory that Kotowski had\n\nawakened to find her assailant in the apartment and had been beaten\n\nto prevent her from identifying her assailant.             Kotowski knew\n\nO'Laughlin; indeed, she had been cool to his interest in her.\n\n          O'Laughlin had the means to perpetrate this attack.             He\n\nlived only two doors down from Kotowski and, as a maintenance\n\nworker in the apartment complex, had a key to Kotowski's apartment,\n\nhad been there, and knew the apartment's layout.           That level of\n\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\faccess was necessary to commit the crime because the police found\n\nno signs of forced entry into Kotowski's apartment.        Additionally,\n\nthe police found a weapon that could have been used in the attack\n\n-- a baseball bat with O'Laughlin's name inscribed on the barrel --\n\nhidden under some leaves in the woods behind the apartment complex.\n\nMoreover, the police encountered O'Laughlin near the scene of the\n\ncrime just minutes after the attack and noticed the next day that\n\nhe had a cut on his face and a bruise below his left ear, which\n\nwere consistent with being involved in a struggle.\n\n           O'Laughlin also had a motive.          He had smoked crack\n\ncocaine in the hours before the attack and had called several drug\n\ndealers from the telephone in his apartment only minutes before the\n\nattack, desperately seeking more drugs. O'Laughlin had no money to\n\nbuy more drugs that night, and he thought that Kotowski was well\n\noff from seeing her apartment.     Although Kotowski's attacker took\n\nnothing from the apartment, police found her purse on the floor\n\nnear the bathroom.    Kotowski testified that she typically kept her\n\npurse on the inside handle of her bedroom door.          The prosecution\n\nargued   that   Kotowski's   attacker   left   without   taking   anything\n\nbecause, during the attack, he had heard Kotowski's upstairs\n\nneighbor get to the phone and speak, and feared that the police\n\nwere on the way.      The police reenacted the upstairs neighbor's\n\ntelephone call and determined that a person in Kotowski's apartment\n\ncould hear that the upstairs neighbor was speaking on the phone.\n\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\f            O'Laughlin also demonstrated a consciousness of guilt.\n\nHe appeared \"uneasy and distant\" when the police encountered him\n\noutside shortly after 2:00 a.m. in near-freezing temperatures\n\nwearing nothing but his boxer shorts.          O'Laughlin told the police\n\na series of lies and repeatedly shifted his story as to what he was\n\ndoing on the night of the attack.          When O'Laughlin encountered the\n\npolice shortly after the attack, they told him they had been unable\n\nto locate unit 202, the apartment of the upstairs neighbor who had\n\ncalled the police.         O'Laughlin, who knew that the units had\n\nrecently been renumbered and that unit 202 was now unit 16, did not\n\ndisclose that information to the officers.           Rather, he misdirected\n\nthem by changing their focus to purported animal noises he had\n\nheard    coming   from   the   dumpster,    where   the   police     then   went.\n\nFinding nothing of interest in the dumpster, the police decided to\n\nleave.    When the police returned to the apartment complex the next\n\nday, O'Laughlin refused to let the police swab what appeared to be\n\na blood stain in his apartment and cleaned up the stain before\n\nallowing    the   police   to   return.       And   he    gave   a   number    of\n\ninconsistent, and sometimes inherently incredible, statements about\n\nthe events of that night.\n\n            A primary defense theory was that Kotowski's estranged\n\nhusband, not the defendant, had committed the assault. The husband\n\ntestified, and the jury rejected that theory.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\f                                        II.\n\n             The state's petition for rehearing en banc presents what\n\nis essentially a three part argument: (1) that the panel has\n\narticulated and applied a new sufficiency of evidence test, which\n\nis not clearly established law from the Supreme Court and is, in\n\nfact, inconsistent with Jackson; (2) that the panel decision\n\notherwise violates AEDPA's strictures that relief may be granted\n\nonly where the state court engages in an \"unreasonable application\"\n\nof clearly established federal law; and (3) that the panel has,\n\ncontrary to Jackson, failed to look to the totality of the evidence\n\nand has failed to draw all inferences in favor of the verdict as\n\nrequired.      All    three    aspects      of   the   state's   petition      raise\n\nsignificant issues of law, which in my view warrant rehearing en\n\nbanc.\n\n             Before addressing the merits of the state's arguments, it\n\nis important to set forth the basic framework for our review.                    We\n\nowe deference to the state court proceedings on two levels. First,\n\nbecause O'Laughlin's core argument is to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, we must uphold the jury's verdict unless \"it can be said\n\nthat no rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\"     Jackson, 443 U.S. at 317.            In making this determination,\n\nwe   view    the    evidence     in   the    light     most   favorable   to    the\n\nprosecution.       Id. at 319.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 6 -\n\f            Second, we review O'Laughlin's sufficiency challenge\n\nthrough the lens of federal habeas review.                   Under the federal\n\nhabeas statute, we must presume the correctness of all factual\n\ndeterminations made by the state court, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1),\n\nand may grant the writ only if the state court's decision was\n\n\"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\n\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\n\nUnited States,\" id. § 2254(d)(1).            Under this standard, we must\n\nuphold even state court decisions that are incorrect so long as\n\nthey are reasonable.        See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 410\n\n(2000) (\"For purposes of today's opinion, the most important point\n\nis that an unreasonable application of federal law is different\n\nfrom   an   incorrect     application   of    federal    law.\"   (emphasis    in\n\noriginal)); see also Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 473 (2007)\n\n(\"The question under AEDPA is not whether a federal court believes\n\nthe state court's determination was incorrect but whether that\n\ndetermination       was   unreasonable       --   a    substantially      higher\n\nthreshold.\").\n\n            Thus,    to   prevail,   O'Laughlin       must    make   a   two-fold\n\nshowing: (1) that no reasonable juror could have voted to convict;\n\nand (2) that the contrary view of the state court was not only\n\nwrong but unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 7 -\n\fA.          The Proper Test for Assessing a Sufficiency Challenge\n\n            The panel's opinion applied the Sixth Circuit's test for\n\nsufficiency, which holds that if the jury's verdict rested on\n\n\"circumstantial evidence . . . [that] amounts to only a reasonable\n\nspeculation,\" it must be vacated.           See O'Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at\n\n302 (quoting Newman v. Metrish, 543 F.3d 793, 796 (6th Cir. 2008),\n\npetition for cert. filed, 77 U.S.L.W. 3645 (U.S. May 12, 2009) (No.\n\n08-1401)).        The panel opinion opened its evaluation of the SJC's\n\nopinion by quoting from and implicitly adopting the Newman test.\n\nIt then said that test was met in this case, repeated the term\n\n\"reasonable speculation,\" and drew heavily on Newman, giving it\n\nfour pages of discussion.\n\n            \"Reasonable speculation\" is not the standard the Supreme\n\nCourt has articulated to assess evidentiary sufficiency under\n\nJackson.      Instead, the Jackson standard asks \"whether, after\n\nviewing     the    evidence     in    the   light   most    favorable   to   the\n\nprosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"                  443\n\nU.S.   at   319     (emphasis    in    original).     The    term   \"reasonable\n\nspeculation\" appears nowhere in Jackson or in any of the Supreme\n\nCourt's sufficiency jurisprudence.              Indeed, until the panel's\n\nopinion in this case, the Sixth Circuit was the only circuit to use\n\nthat standard.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 8 -\n\f             The   \"reasonable    speculation\"    standard    is   materially\n\ndifferent     from   the   Jackson     standard   in   that   it    prohibits\n\nconvictions from resting on reasonable inferences drawn from the\n\nevidence.1     This new standard strongly disfavors circumstantial\n\nevidence,2    contrary     to   our   long-standing    recognition    that   a\n\ncriminal conviction may rest on circumstantial evidence alone. See\n\nUnited States v. Rodríguez-Durán, 507 F.3d 749, 758 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(\"[C]ircumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient to provide a\n\nbasis for conviction.\"); see also United States v. Downs-Moses, 329\n\nF.3d 253, 261 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"[W]e do not favor direct evidence\n\nover circumstantial evidence, as either type of evidence may\n\nsatisfactorily support a conviction.\").\n\n             This devaluation of circumstantial evidence by a federal\n\nhabeas court has sweeping implications.            The government relies\n\nheavily on circumstantial evidence to prove cases where direct\n\nwitness testimony about the commission of a crime is unavailable.\n\nThis is particularly true in domestic and acquaintance violence\n\nprosecutions, where the victims, who often have the only direct\n\nevidence of their abusers' guilt, are left unable to testify or\n\n\n     1\n        The term \"reasonable speculation\" contains an inherent\nconflict.   Recognizing that a conclusion rests on speculation\nsuggests that the inferences upon which it is based are\nunreasonable.\n     2\n       The dichotomy drawn by the panel between circumstantial and\ndirect evidence is questionable.      Convictions often rest on\ninferences which are drawn from direct testimony, as well as\ncircumstantial evidence.\n\n                                      - 9 -\n\fthey recant or refuse to cooperate.     See T. Linger, Prosecuting\n\nBatterers After Crawford, 91 Va. L. Rev. 747, 768 (2005) (\"Recent\n\nevidence suggests that 80 to 85 percent of battered women will\n\nrecant at some point.\").    The panel's \"reasonable speculation\"\n\nrule, which substantially discounts the power of circumstantial\n\nevidence, jeopardizes these and other prosecutions where the only\n\nevidence of the defendant's guilt is circumstantial.\n\n          In addition to the infirmities in the substance of the\n\n\"reasonable speculation\" rule, the panel's use of another circuit\n\ncourt's precedent to grant habeas relief is troubling given AEDPA's\n\nrequirement that the state court's error be measured against\n\n\"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt of the United States.\"     28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (emphasis\n\nadded). Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that if\n\nit has not recognized a particular circuit court legal standard, a\n\nstate court's failure to follow that standard cannot compel the\n\ngrant of habeas relief.   See, e.g., Knowles v. Mirzayance, 129 S.\n\nCt. 1411, 1419 (2009) (holding that federal habeas relief is\n\nunavailable based upon the application of \"a specific legal rule\n\nthat has not been squarely established by this Court.\"); Carey v.\n\nMusladin, 549 U.S. 70, 76-77 (2006) (same).\n\nB.        Limitations Under AEDPA\n\n          The panel opinion's analysis of the reasonableness of the\n\nSJC's opinion substantially departed from the level of deference\n\n\n                               - 10 -\n\ffor the determinations of the state courts that Congress and the\n\nSupreme Court have provided the federal courts under AEDPA.3                 The\n\npanel opinion states that the SJC's sufficiency determination was\n\nunreasonable because: (1) O'Laughlin's prior contacts with Kotowski\n\nwere minimal; (2) the facts here \"do[] not align\" with a robbery\n\nmotive; (3) the prosecution's weapon was \"merely 'consistent'\" with\n\nKotowski's   injuries;    (4)   the   motive   evidence   here    was    \"mere\n\nconjecture\"; (5) O'Laughlin was not caught in a lie and did not\n\nflee the scene; and (6) the evidence of consciousness of guilt was\n\n\"bare conjecture.\"    O'Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at 306-08.             At most,\n\nthese examples amount to a disagreement as to the weight particular\n\npieces of evidence should receive and the inferences to be drawn\n\nfrom them.   But a state prisoner is not entitled to habeas relief\n\nunder AEDPA merely because a federal court disagrees with the state\n\ncourt's assessment of the evidence.        See Williams, 529 U.S. at 410\n\n(recognizing   that   a   state   court's      determination     is    not    an\n\nunreasonable application of law merely because it is erroneous).\n\nThe state court's determination must be so incorrect as to be an\n\n\n     3\n         The result of this case -- a federal appeals court\nreversing the state's highest court on the question of evidentiary\nsufficiency in a criminal prosecution -- is also surprising given\nthe SJC's historically favorable treatment of criminal defendants.\nIndeed, the SJC often extends criminal defendants greater\nprotections than those required under the federal Constitution.\nSee, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gomes, 903 N.E.2d 567 (Mass. 2009)\n(limiting the police's power to pat frisk suspected drug dealers\nfor weapons); Commonwealth v. Mavredakis, 725 N.E.2d 169 (Mass.\n2000) (holding that the police have a duty to inform a criminal\ndefendant of his lawyer's efforts to contact him).\n\n                                  - 11 -\n\funreasonable application of law, which is \"a substantially higher\n\nthreshold.\"     Schriro, 550 U.S. at 473.\n\n              The state's petition for rehearing argues that en banc\n\nreview should be granted in this case because it is part of an\n\nemerging pattern of non-compliance with AEDPA where the federal\n\ncourts   of     appeals    have     been     granting   habeas     relief      in\n\ncircumstantial evidence cases.            See Newman, 543 F.3d at 796; see\n\nalso Brown v. Farwell, 525 F.3d 787 (9th Cir. 2008), cert. granted\n\nsub nom, McDaniel v. Brown, 129 S. Ct. 1038 (2009).\n\n              Having read the record before the federal court, I am\n\nconvinced that the SJC's holding on the sufficiency issue was not\n\nonly a reasonable application of Jackson but also entirely correct\n\nunder the Jackson standard. The SJC's seventeen-page opinion shows\n\nthere was a detailed review of the trial record by the justices and\n\narticulates and applies the correct constitutional standard for\n\nsufficiency of the evidence.\n\n              I start with the SJC's finding that O'Laughlin had a\n\nfinancial motive for breaking into the unit, which led to the\n\nattack   on    Kotowski.    The     SJC    explained:   \"The    defendant     had\n\npurchased crack cocaine on two different occasions on the evening\n\nof November 16 and had been ingesting drugs and beer all night.                He\n\nhad run out of both drugs and money later in the evening and was\n\ndesperately seeking to obtain more drugs.\"              O'Laughlin II, 843\n\nN.E.2d   at    627.   In   short,    O'Laughlin    needed      money,   and   the\n\n\n                                    - 12 -\n\fprosecution put on evidence that O'Laughlin suspected Kotowski was\n\nwell off and a potential source of funding.\n\n          The panel opinion, however, dismissed robbery as a motive\n\nbecause Kotowski's assailant took nothing from the apartment.   See\n\nO'Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at 306.   But as the SJC explained, this\n\nmotive was not negated by the fact that the assailant ultimately\n\ntook nothing.    It held that the attacker could well have been\n\nfrightened off before he took anything by the sounds of the\n\nupstairs neighbor speaking with the police on the phone as the\n\nattack took place.    See O'Laughlin II, 843 N.E.2d at 627 n.11.\n\nThis explanation is quite reasonable and has evidentiary support.\n\nIndeed, a reenactment of the police phone call demonstrated that a\n\nperson in Kotowski's apartment could hear the neighbor walking\n\naround upstairs and speaking on the phone.    And the location where\n\nthe police found Kotowski's purse also supports this theory.\n\n          The panel opinion also attempts to dismiss the SJC's\n\nfinding that O'Laughlin had the means to commit the crime because\n\nhe had a master key and there were no signs of forced entry by\n\nsaying that others had a master key and that the victim could have\n\nlet her assailant into the apartment. See O'Laughlin III, 568 F.3d\n\nat 302.   These alternative explanations are, of course, possible.\n\nBut to credit them requires that the court draw inferences against\n\nthe jury's verdict, which it may not do under Jackson.    And in any\n\n\n\n\n                              - 13 -\n\fevent, these alternative theories in no way diminish the SJC's\n\nfinding that O'Laughlin had the means to commit the crime.\n\n            There is no need to catalog the entire array of the panel\n\nopinion's    disagreements   with   the   SJC's    rational     inferences.\n\nInstead, I will focus on the panel opinion's primary disagreement\n\nwith the SJC, which relates to the appropriate weight to give the\n\nevidence    of   O'Laughlin's   consciousness     of   guilt.     The   SJC\n\ncharacterized this as the strongest evidence of O'Laughlin's guilt.\n\nSee O'Laughlin II, 843 N.E.2d at 627-28.               The panel opinion,\n\nhowever, found this evidence \"minimally probative.\"             O'Laughlin\n\nIII, 568 F.3d at 303.\n\n            The SJC's conclusion that there was strong evidence of\n\nconsciousness of guilt is both correct and entirely supported by a\n\nreasonable application of Jackson.        O'Laughlin gave the police a\n\nseries of differing accounts as to his activities that night, which\n\na jury could easily conclude were untrue and implausible. The jury\n\ncould reasonably infer the following.             When the police first\n\nencountered O'Laughlin after 2:00 a.m. outside in his boxer shorts\n\nin near-freezing weather,4 O'Laughlin appeared \"uneasy and distant\"\n\nand lied to the police by saying that he was asleep and had been\n\n\n\n     4\n       The prosecution argued that O'Laughlin came outside wearing\nonly boxer shorts on such a cold night because he had stripped off\nhis bloody clothes just before the police arrived.       After the\npolice left that night, O'Laughlin had several hours during which\nhe could have disposed of any bloody clothing and any weapon before\nthe police returned the next morning.\n\n                                 - 14 -\n\fawakened by the sound of screaming.              When O'Laughlin was asked\n\nwhere the screaming was coming from after the police were unable to\n\nlocate unit 202, O'Laughlin altered his position and said he\n\nthought the screaming might have been a racoon that had gotten\n\nstuck in the dumpster and explained that he had placed a stick in\n\nthe dumpster to allow the animal to escape.               This misdirection,\n\nalong   with     O'Laughlin's   failure     to   inform   the    police      of   the\n\napartment complex's new unit numbering, distracted the police away\n\nfrom the victim's apartment.\n\n            The next day, O'Laughlin gave the police a different\n\naccount, saying that he had been asleep but was awakened by the\n\nsound of the police cruisers arriving (not screaming) and so went\n\nout   in   the   freezing   cold   nearly    unclothed.         He   later    again\n\nrecharacterized his actions, claiming again to have been sleeping\n\nuntil he was awakened by screaming from animals (foxes or racoons)\n\nfighting.\n\n            In fact, O'Laughlin's telephone records indicated that he\n\nhad been on the phone frequently just minutes before the police\n\narrived.       His accounts that he had been sleeping were a lie.\n\nO'Laughlin later also lied in order to explain away those phone\n\ncalls in a letter he sent to the building manager, saying that an\n\nintruder into his unit had placed those calls from his apartment\n\nwhile he slept. A jury could reasonable conclude that O'Laughlin's\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 15 -\n\fshifting stories and overt lies demonstrated a strong consciousness\n\nof guilt.\n\n            Also damning are O'Laughlin's efforts to remove what he\n\ndescribed as a blood stain from the door of his closet.         When\n\npolice noticed the stain and requested to take a sample, O'Laughlin\n\nwithdrew his consent to have his apartment searched.       After the\n\npolice left, O'Laughlin wiped up the stain with his finger and\n\nsaliva.\n\n            It was only when the police returned to his apartment and\n\nthreatened to get a search warrant that he consented to allow the\n\npolice to search his apartment again.     By then, he had wiped away\n\nthe stain.\n\n            O'Laughlin's explanation that his behavior was motivated\n\nby a concern that the police would discover his drug paraphernalia\n\ncould be rationally rejected as entirely inconsistent with the fact\n\nof both consents.   Moreover, the police assured O'Laughlin that he\n\nwould not be prosecuted for any drug crimes if he voluntarily\n\nsurrendered any contraband to the police, further reducing the\n\ncredibility of O'Laughlin's explanation for his reluctance.\n\n            Whether a state court decision represents an unreasonable\n\napplication of clearly established federal law is a difficult\n\njudgment for a federal court to make.          The need for better\n\narticulation of the legal standards for making that judgment,\n\nparticularly where the record is largely circumstantial, in my\n\n\n                                - 16 -\n\fview, constitutes an appropriate basis on which to grant en banc\n\nreview.\n\nC.          The Panel Opinion's Method of Analysis\n\n            More    fundamentally,      the    panel    opinion's      method      of\n\nanalysis sets a dangerous precedent because it draws inferences\n\nagainst the jury's verdict and it takes a piecemeal approach to\n\nanalyzing the evidence.      That is, the panel opinion's approach to\n\nthe   sufficiency    question    in    operation    amounts       to   a   de    novo\n\nassessment of the record through which the court substitutes its\n\nown independent assessment of the record for the jury's evaluation.\n\nThis sort of analysis should be foreign to an appellate court,\n\nwhich has access only to a cold record.            And it is a particularly\n\ndangerous   exercise    in   a   case    like   this,     where    much     of    the\n\nprosecution's case depended on the testimony of witnesses and an\n\nassessment of the credibility of those witnesses.\n\n            Under    Jackson,    an     appellate       court     considering       a\n\nsufficiency challenge is not on an equal footing with the jury.\n\nInstead, \"the factfinder's role as weigher of the evidence is\n\npreserved through a legal conclusion that upon judicial review all\n\nof the evidence is to be considered in the light most favorable to\n\nthe prosecution.\" Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319 (emphasis in original).\n\n            The panel opinion, however, fails to respect the role of\n\nthe jury in deciding which evidence to credit and what reasonable\n\ninferences to draw from that evidence.                 For example, the panel\n\n\n                                      - 17 -\n\fopinion rejected the reasonable inference that Kotowski's assailant\n\nfled before taking anything of value from the apartment because he\n\nheard her upstairs neighbor on the telephone with the police.\n\nInstead, the panel held that \"no rational juror could conclude that\n\nthe placement of this phone call frightened him off given the\n\nvolume and duration of Mrs. Kotowski's screams.\"        O'Laughlin III,\n\n568 F.3d at 302.   Although it would be entirely permissible for a\n\njury to resist drawing this inference, an appellate court applying\n\nthe Jackson standard does not have the freedom to pick between\n\ncompeting reasonable inferences in this manner.       See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir. 2006) (recognizing that\n\n\"competing   inferences   are   not   enough   to   disturb   the   jury's\n\nverdict,\" even in a case where the evidence of the defendant's\n\nguilt was \"entirely circumstantial\").\n\n          The panel opinion's method of analysis suffers from a\n\nrelated defect to the extent that it dismisses pieces of evidence\n\nby treating them in isolation, instead of considering the totality\n\nof the evidence together.   For example, the panel opinion resisted\n\nconcluding that a reasonable jury could consider that the aluminum\n\nbaseball bat that the police found in the woods twenty-five yards\n\nfrom Kotowski's apartment was evidence of O'Laughlin's guilt.         The\n\npanel dismissed this because \"any bat likely would have been\n\nconsistent with her injuries\" and because the upstairs neighbor had\n\ndescribed sounds like wood hitting on wood.         O'Laughlin III, 568\n\n\n                                - 18 -\n\fF.3d at 302. But the fact that Kotowski's injuries were consistent\n\nwith being beaten with a baseball bat is only one of the facts that\n\nwould have permitted a rational juror to conclude that the bat\n\nwhich the police found was the assailant's weapon.           The panel's\n\nanalysis ignores several other key facts relating to the bat, which\n\nhad been found in close proximity to the scene of the crime.\n\nO'Laughlin's name was inscribed on it, and O'Laughlin was closely\n\ntied to the crime by the prosecution's other evidence of his\n\nmotive, means, and consciousness of guilt.         The bat was hidden\n\nunder some leaves and debris as though someone had tried to\n\ncarefully conceal it.     And the bat was otherwise clean, suggesting\n\nthat it had not been in the woods for long and had been cleaned\n\noff.\n\n           This model of effectively performing de novo review\n\nrather than drawing inferences in favor of the verdict, if widely\n\nadopted,   would   have   unfortunate   consequences.   It    calls   for\n\nappellate courts to make determinations that are well beyond the\n\ninstitutional capacity of a court to do working from a cold record.\n\nAnd it conflicts with the usual rules of finality, effectively\n\ngiving criminal defendants multiple opportunities to make their\n\ncase in the first instance. Indeed, the government is particularly\n\nprejudiced when we overreach to decide these cases on sufficiency\n\ngrounds because principles of double jeopardy prevent the habeas\n\npetitioner from being retried.     See Evans v. Thompson, 518 F.3d 1,\n\n\n                                 - 19 -\n\f7 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"Sometimes double jeopardy principles mean the\n\nhabeas petitioner is simply released, as is done when the evidence\n\nof guilt is insufficient.\").\n\n                                     III.\n\n           Sufficiency questions are inherently fact-bound, and so\n\nmy disagreement with the panel opinion may appear, at first glance,\n\nto be a dispute over these facts with few implications beyond this\n\ncase.   But my concerns with the panel opinion run far deeper than\n\nthat. In my view, the panel's implicit adoption of the \"reasonable\n\nspeculation\" standard impermissibly alters our circuit's approach\n\nto   sufficiency    questions,      substantially   disadvantaging      whole\n\ncategories of cases -- like domestic and acquaintance violence\n\nprosecutions   --    where    the    government's   evidence      is   largely\n\ncircumstantial.      And     the    panel's   approach   sets    a   dangerous\n\nprecedent to the extent that it deviates from the narrow role\n\nCongress envisioned for federal habeas review under AEDPA by\n\nsubstituting the federal court's own independent assessment of the\n\nfacts for the state court's.\n\n           We have previously granted en banc review to address\n\nsimilarly important questions relating to the contours of federal\n\nhabeas review, see, e.g., McCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (en banc), and I would do so again here.             Thus, with the\n\ngreatest respect for my colleagues, I dissent from the denial of en\n\nbanc review.   See United States v. Rivera, No. 95-2186, 1996 WL\n\n\n                                    - 20 -\n\f338379 (1st Cir. June 18, 1996) (Lynch, J., dissenting from the\n\ndenial of en banc review).\n\n\n\n                  \"Concurring Opinion Follows\"\n\n\n\n\n                             - 21 -\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, with LIPEZ, Circuit Judge,\n\nConcurring in the denial of en banc review.      I am forced to comment\n\non the dissent from the denial of en banc review because it\n\nmischaracterizes the reasoning of the unanimous panel opinion, an\n\nopinion which neither articulates nor applies a sufficiency of the\n\nevidence   test   inconsistent   with   the   Supreme   Court's   clearly\n\nestablished law under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). To\n\nsuggest that the panel opinion adopts \"reasonable speculation\" as\n\nsome sort of binding \"legal rule\" is incorrect.          We do not even\n\nmention the term in the section where we discuss the constitutional\n\nright asserted -- a section entitled \"The Jackson Standard,\"\n\nO'Laughlin v. O'Brien, 568 F.3d 287, 300-02 (1st Cir. 2009) -- and\n\nwe consistently apply the Jackson standard to the facts of this\n\ncase.   When read in context, our use of the term \"reasonable\n\nspeculation\"      merely   frowns   upon      speculative   evidentiary\n\ninterpretations and in no way suggests that we disfavor the use of\n\ncircumstantial evidence.      In fact, with respect to this latter\n\npoint, we explicitly state that \"direct evidence of identification\n\nis not necessary,\" id. at 301 n.17, and quote our prior precedent\n\naffirming the use of circumstantial evidence, id.\n\n           In addition, the dissent mistakenly contends that the\n\npanel opinion engages in a piecemeal examination of the evidence.\n\nOur approach to deciding whether a jury could conclude that the\n\nevidence was sufficient to identify O'Laughlin as the assailant\n\n\n                                 - 22 -\n\funder Jackson is based on looking at the evidence as a whole.     We\n\nbegin and end our discussion of this evidence by stating that we\n\nconsider the evidence in its totality.       See id. at 302 (\"Taken\n\ntogether, the circumstantial evidence in this case, even when\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, does\n\nnot permit any rational jury to conclude that O'Laughlin was the\n\nassailant beyond a reasonable doubt.\"); id. at 304 (\"Given the\n\ninsufficiency of the evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, tying\n\nO'Laughlin to the attack, we conclude that a rational jury could\n\nnot find O'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"). In order\n\nto arrive at our conclusion that the evidence in its totality is\n\nnot sufficient to permit a rational jury to find O'Laughlin's guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, we necessarily had to consider the\n\nfactors the SJC weighed, namely evidence supporting O'Laughlin's\n\nmotive, opportunity, means, and consciousness of guilt.      This is\n\nconsistent with how we have dealt with sufficiency issues in the\n\npast.    See, e.g., Leftwich v. Maloney, 532 F.3d 20, 25-27 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n            Finally, the dissent's contention that the panel opinion\n\nengages in a de novo review of the record is plainly wrong.      The\n\nopinion recounts the facts as presented by the SJC and holds,\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, that\n\nthe SJC was objectively unreasonable in concluding that O'Laughlin\n\nwas the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt. This approach was not\n\n\n                                - 23 -\n\flegal    error.   The   bottom   line   is   that   we   read   the   record\n\ndifferently than the dissent, not that we apply the wrong legal\n\nstandard.\n\n            As we state in the panel opinion, we fully appreciate\n\n\"the great degree of deference state court judgments are due,\n\nespecially those that uphold jury verdicts,\" O'Laughlin, 568 F.3d\n\nat 300, and \"the extremely high bar that must be overcome on habeas\n\nreview,\" id. at 304.       Despite this hurdle, however, in rare\n\ninstances there are fact-intensive cases where a state court's\n\ndetermination as to guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is so incorrect\n\nas to be objectively unreasonable.        A unanimous panel agreed that\n\nthis is such a case.1     With the utmost respect to our dissenting\n\ncolleague, the en banc court is correct in its decision to deny the\n\npetition for rehearing.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n        We also note that the Massachusetts Appeals Court, while\nadmittedly applying a different standard on direct review,\noverturned O'Laughlin's conviction, concluding that there was\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.\n\n                                 - 24 -\n\f",

Because the sufficiency\n\nstandard applied by the panel has consequences well beyond this\n\ncase and the panel's application of that standard to this case\n\nupsets the congressionally defined role of federal habeas review in\n\nour federal system, I respectfully dissent from the denial of en\n\nbanc review.\n\n                                   I.\n\n          Around 2:00 a.m. on November 17, 2000, Kotowski was\n\nseverely beaten in her apartment by an assailant whom she could not\n\nlater identify because of the memory loss she suffered as a result\n\nof the attack.    The assailant nearly killed Kotowski, breaking\n\nalmost every bone in her skull, as well as several in her hands.\n\nThe evidence supported the prosecution's theory that Kotowski had\n\nawakened to find her assailant in the apartment and had been beaten\n\nto prevent her from identifying her assailant.             Kotowski knew\n\nO'Laughlin; indeed, she had been cool to his interest in her.\n\n          O'Laughlin had the means to perpetrate this attack.             He\n\nlived only two doors down from Kotowski and, as a maintenance\n\nworker in the apartment complex, had a key to Kotowski's apartment,\n\nhad been there, and knew the apartment's layout.           That level of\n\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\faccess was necessary to commit the crime because the police found\n\nno signs of forced entry into Kotowski's apartment.        Additionally,\n\nthe police found a weapon that could have been used in the attack\n\n-- a baseball bat with O'Laughlin's name inscribed on the barrel --\n\nhidden under some leaves in the woods behind the apartment complex.\n\nMoreover, the police encountered O'Laughlin near the scene of the\n\ncrime just minutes after the attack and noticed the next day that\n\nhe had a cut on his face and a bruise below his left ear, which\n\nwere consistent with being involved in a struggle.\n\n           O'Laughlin also had a motive.          He had smoked crack\n\ncocaine in the hours before the attack and had called several drug\n\ndealers from the telephone in his apartment only minutes before the\n\nattack, desperately seeking more drugs. O'Laughlin had no money to\n\nbuy more drugs that night, and he thought that Kotowski was well\n\noff from seeing her apartment.     Although Kotowski's attacker took\n\nnothing from the apartment, police found her purse on the floor\n\nnear the bathroom.    Kotowski testified that she typically kept her\n\npurse on the inside handle of her bedroom door.          The prosecution\n\nargued   that   Kotowski's   attacker   left   without   taking   anything\n\nbecause, during the attack, he had heard Kotowski's upstairs\n\nneighbor get to the phone and speak, and feared that the police\n\nwere on the way.      The police reenacted the upstairs neighbor's\n\ntelephone call and determined that a person in Kotowski's apartment\n\ncould hear that the upstairs neighbor was speaking on the phone.\n\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\f            O'Laughlin also demonstrated a consciousness of guilt.\n\nHe appeared \"uneasy and distant\" when the police encountered him\n\noutside shortly after 2:00 a.m. in near-freezing temperatures\n\nwearing nothing but his boxer shorts.          O'Laughlin told the police\n\na series of lies and repeatedly shifted his story as to what he was\n\ndoing on the night of the attack.          When O'Laughlin encountered the\n\npolice shortly after the attack, they told him they had been unable\n\nto locate unit 202, the apartment of the upstairs neighbor who had\n\ncalled the police.         O'Laughlin, who knew that the units had\n\nrecently been renumbered and that unit 202 was now unit 16, did not\n\ndisclose that information to the officers.           Rather, he misdirected\n\nthem by changing their focus to purported animal noises he had\n\nheard    coming   from   the   dumpster,    where   the   police     then   went.\n\nFinding nothing of interest in the dumpster, the police decided to\n\nleave.    When the police returned to the apartment complex the next\n\nday, O'Laughlin refused to let the police swab what appeared to be\n\na blood stain in his apartment and cleaned up the stain before\n\nallowing    the   police   to   return.       And   he    gave   a   number    of\n\ninconsistent, and sometimes inherently incredible, statements about\n\nthe events of that night.\n\n            A primary defense theory was that Kotowski's estranged\n\nhusband, not the defendant, had committed the assault. The husband\n\ntestified, and the jury rejected that theory.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\f                                        II.\n\n             The state's petition for rehearing en banc presents what\n\nis essentially a three part argument: (1) that the panel has\n\narticulated and applied a new sufficiency of evidence test, which\n\nis not clearly established law from the Supreme Court and is, in\n\nfact, inconsistent with Jackson; (2) that the panel decision\n\notherwise violates AEDPA's strictures that relief may be granted\n\nonly where the state court engages in an \"unreasonable application\"\n\nof clearly established federal law; and (3) that the panel has,\n\ncontrary to Jackson, failed to look to the totality of the evidence\n\nand has failed to draw all inferences in favor of the verdict as\n\nrequired.      All    three    aspects      of   the   state's   petition      raise\n\nsignificant issues of law, which in my view warrant rehearing en\n\nbanc.\n\n             Before addressing the merits of the state's arguments, it\n\nis important to set forth the basic framework for our review.                    We\n\nowe deference to the state court proceedings on two levels. First,\n\nbecause O'Laughlin's core argument is to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, we must uphold the jury's verdict unless \"it can be said\n\nthat no rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\"     Jackson, 443 U.S. at 317.            In making this determination,\n\nwe   view    the    evidence     in   the    light     most   favorable   to    the\n\nprosecution.       Id. at 319.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 6 -\n\f            Second, we review O'Laughlin's sufficiency challenge\n\nthrough the lens of federal habeas review.                   Under the federal\n\nhabeas statute, we must presume the correctness of all factual\n\ndeterminations made by the state court, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1),\n\nand may grant the writ only if the state court's decision was\n\n\"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\n\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\n\nUnited States,\" id. § 2254(d)(1).            Under this standard, we must\n\nuphold even state court decisions that are incorrect so long as\n\nthey are reasonable.        See Williams v.

The panel opinion opened its evaluation of the SJC's\n\nopinion by quoting from and implicitly adopting the Newman test.\n\nIt then said that test was met in this case, repeated the term\n\n\"reasonable speculation,\" and drew heavily on Newman, giving it\n\nfour pages of discussion.\n\n            \"Reasonable speculation\" is not the standard the Supreme\n\nCourt has articulated to assess evidentiary sufficiency under\n\nJackson.      Instead, the Jackson standard asks \"whether, after\n\nviewing     the    evidence     in    the   light   most    favorable   to   the\n\nprosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"                  443\n\nU.S.   at   319     (emphasis    in    original).     The    term   \"reasonable\n\nspeculation\" appears nowhere in Jackson or in any of the Supreme\n\nCourt's sufficiency jurisprudence.              Indeed, until the panel's\n\nopinion in this case, the Sixth Circuit was the only circuit to use\n\nthat standard.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 8 -\n\f             The   \"reasonable    speculation\"    standard    is   materially\n\ndifferent     from   the   Jackson     standard   in   that   it    prohibits\n\nconvictions from resting on reasonable inferences drawn from the\n\nevidence.1     This new standard strongly disfavors circumstantial\n\nevidence,2    contrary     to   our   long-standing    recognition    that   a\n\ncriminal conviction may rest on circumstantial evidence alone.

The government relies\n\nheavily on circumstantial evidence to prove cases where direct\n\nwitness testimony about the commission of a crime is unavailable.\n\nThis is particularly true in domestic and acquaintance violence\n\nprosecutions, where the victims, who often have the only direct\n\nevidence of their abusers' guilt, are left unable to testify or\n\n\n     1\n        The term \"reasonable speculation\" contains an inherent\nconflict.   Recognizing that a conclusion rests on speculation\nsuggests that the inferences upon which it is based are\nunreasonable.\n     2\n       The dichotomy drawn by the panel between circumstantial and\ndirect evidence is questionable.      Convictions often rest on\ninferences which are drawn from direct testimony, as well as\ncircumstantial evidence.\n\n                                      - 9 -\n\fthey recant or refuse to cooperate.

The panel's \"reasonable speculation\"\n\nrule, which substantially discounts the power of circumstantial\n\nevidence, jeopardizes these and other prosecutions where the only\n\nevidence of the defendant's guilt is circumstantial.\n\n          In addition to the infirmities in the substance of the\n\n\"reasonable speculation\" rule, the panel's use of another circuit\n\ncourt's precedent to grant habeas relief is troubling given AEDPA's\n\nrequirement that the state court's error be measured against\n\n\"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt of the United States.\"     28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (emphasis\n\nadded). Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that if\n\nit has not recognized a particular circuit court legal standard, a\n\nstate court's failure to follow that standard cannot compel the\n\ngrant of habeas relief.

Mirzayance, 129 S.\n\nCt. 1411, 1419 (2009) (holding that federal habeas relief is\n\nunavailable based upon the application of \"a specific legal rule\n\nthat has not been squarely established by this Court.\"); Carey v.\n\nMusladin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145770\"><a href=\"/opinion/145770/carey-v-musladin/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76-77 (2006) (same).\n\nB.        Limitations Under AEDPA\n\n          The panel opinion's analysis of the reasonableness of the\n\nSJC's opinion substantially departed from the level of deference\n\n\n                               - 10 -\n\ffor the determinations of the state courts that Congress and the\n\nSupreme Court have provided the federal courts under AEDPA.3                 The\n\npanel opinion states that the SJC's sufficiency determination was\n\nunreasonable because: (1) O'Laughlin's prior contacts with Kotowski\n\nwere minimal; (2) the facts here \"do[] not align\" with a robbery\n\nmotive; (3) the prosecution's weapon was \"merely 'consistent'\" with\n\nKotowski's   injuries;    (4)   the   motive   evidence   here    was    \"mere\n\nconjecture\"; (5) O'Laughlin was not caught in a lie and did not\n\nflee the scene; and (6) the evidence of consciousness of guilt was\n\n\"bare conjecture.\"    O'Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at 306-08.             At most,\n\nthese examples amount to a disagreement as to the weight particular\n\npieces of evidence should receive and the inferences to be drawn\n\nfrom them.   But a state prisoner is not entitled to habeas relief\n\nunder AEDPA merely because a federal court disagrees with the state\n\ncourt's assessment of the evidence.        See Williams, 529 U.S. at 410\n\n(recognizing   that   a   state   court's      determination     is    not    an\n\nunreasonable application of law merely because it is erroneous).\n\nThe state court's determination must be so incorrect as to be an\n\n\n     3\n         The result of this case -- a federal appeals court\nreversing the state's highest court on the question of evidentiary\nsufficiency in a criminal prosecution -- is also surprising given\nthe SJC's historically favorable treatment of criminal defendants.\nIndeed, the SJC often extends criminal defendants greater\nprotections than those required under the federal Constitution.\nSee, e.g., Commonwealth v.

The SJC's seventeen-page opinion shows\n\nthere was a detailed review of the trial record by the justices and\n\narticulates and applies the correct constitutional standard for\n\nsufficiency of the evidence.\n\n              I start with the SJC's finding that O'Laughlin had a\n\nfinancial motive for breaking into the unit, which led to the\n\nattack   on    Kotowski.    The     SJC    explained:   \"The    defendant     had\n\npurchased crack cocaine on two different occasions on the evening\n\nof November 16 and had been ingesting drugs and beer all night.                He\n\nhad run out of both drugs and money later in the evening and was\n\ndesperately seeking to obtain more drugs.\"              O'Laughlin II, 843\n\nN.E.2d   at    627.   In   short,    O'Laughlin    needed      money,   and   the\n\n\n                                    - 12 -\n\fprosecution put on evidence that O'Laughlin suspected Kotowski was\n\nwell off and a potential source of funding.\n\n          The panel opinion, however, dismissed robbery as a motive\n\nbecause Kotowski's assailant took nothing from the apartment.   See\n\nO'Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at 306.   But as the SJC explained, this\n\nmotive was not negated by the fact that the assailant ultimately\n\ntook nothing.    It held that the attacker could well have been\n\nfrightened off before he took anything by the sounds of the\n\nupstairs neighbor speaking with the police on the phone as the\n\nattack took place.    See O'Laughlin II, 843 N.E.2d at 627 n.11.\n\nThis explanation is quite reasonable and has evidentiary support.\n\nIndeed, a reenactment of the police phone call demonstrated that a\n\nperson in Kotowski's apartment could hear the neighbor walking\n\naround upstairs and speaking on the phone.    And the location where\n\nthe police found Kotowski's purse also supports this theory.\n\n          The panel opinion also attempts to dismiss the SJC's\n\nfinding that O'Laughlin had the means to commit the crime because\n\nhe had a master key and there were no signs of forced entry by\n\nsaying that others had a master key and that the victim could have\n\nlet her assailant into the apartment. See O'Laughlin III, 568 F.3d\n\nat 302.   These alternative explanations are, of course, possible.\n\nBut to credit them requires that the court draw inferences against\n\nthe jury's verdict, which it may not do under Jackson.    And in any\n\n\n\n\n                              - 13 -\n\fevent, these alternative theories in no way diminish the SJC's\n\nfinding that O'Laughlin had the means to commit the crime.\n\n            There is no need to catalog the entire array of the panel\n\nopinion's    disagreements   with   the   SJC's    rational     inferences.\n\nInstead, I will focus on the panel opinion's primary disagreement\n\nwith the SJC, which relates to the appropriate weight to give the\n\nevidence    of   O'Laughlin's   consciousness     of   guilt.     The   SJC\n\ncharacterized this as the strongest evidence of O'Laughlin's guilt.\n\nSee O'Laughlin II, 843 N.E.2d at 627-28.               The panel opinion,\n\nhowever, found this evidence \"minimally probative.\"             O'Laughlin\n\nIII, 568 F.3d at 303.\n\n            The SJC's conclusion that there was strong evidence of\n\nconsciousness of guilt is both correct and entirely supported by a\n\nreasonable application of Jackson.        O'Laughlin gave the police a\n\nseries of differing accounts as to his activities that night, which\n\na jury could easily conclude were untrue and implausible. The jury\n\ncould reasonably infer the following.             When the police first\n\nencountered O'Laughlin after 2:00 a.m. outside in his boxer shorts\n\nin near-freezing weather,4 O'Laughlin appeared \"uneasy and distant\"\n\nand lied to the police by saying that he was asleep and had been\n\n\n\n     4\n       The prosecution argued that O'Laughlin came outside wearing\nonly boxer shorts on such a cold night because he had stripped off\nhis bloody clothes just before the police arrived.       After the\npolice left that night, O'Laughlin had several hours during which\nhe could have disposed of any bloody clothing and any weapon before\nthe police returned the next morning.\n\n                                 - 14 -\n\fawakened by the sound of screaming.              When O'Laughlin was asked\n\nwhere the screaming was coming from after the police were unable to\n\nlocate unit 202, O'Laughlin altered his position and said he\n\nthought the screaming might have been a racoon that had gotten\n\nstuck in the dumpster and explained that he had placed a stick in\n\nthe dumpster to allow the animal to escape.               This misdirection,\n\nalong   with     O'Laughlin's   failure     to   inform   the    police      of   the\n\napartment complex's new unit numbering, distracted the police away\n\nfrom the victim's apartment.\n\n            The next day, O'Laughlin gave the police a different\n\naccount, saying that he had been asleep but was awakened by the\n\nsound of the police cruisers arriving (not screaming) and so went\n\nout   in   the   freezing   cold   nearly    unclothed.         He   later    again\n\nrecharacterized his actions, claiming again to have been sleeping\n\nuntil he was awakened by screaming from animals (foxes or racoons)\n\nfighting.\n\n            In fact, O'Laughlin's telephone records indicated that he\n\nhad been on the phone frequently just minutes before the police\n\narrived.       His accounts that he had been sleeping were a lie.\n\nO'Laughlin later also lied in order to explain away those phone\n\ncalls in a letter he sent to the building manager, saying that an\n\nintruder into his unit had placed those calls from his apartment\n\nwhile he slept. A jury could reasonable conclude that O'Laughlin's\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 15 -\n\fshifting stories and overt lies demonstrated a strong consciousness\n\nof guilt.\n\n            Also damning are O'Laughlin's efforts to remove what he\n\ndescribed as a blood stain from the door of his closet.         When\n\npolice noticed the stain and requested to take a sample, O'Laughlin\n\nwithdrew his consent to have his apartment searched.       After the\n\npolice left, O'Laughlin wiped up the stain with his finger and\n\nsaliva.\n\n            It was only when the police returned to his apartment and\n\nthreatened to get a search warrant that he consented to allow the\n\npolice to search his apartment again.     By then, he had wiped away\n\nthe stain.\n\n            O'Laughlin's explanation that his behavior was motivated\n\nby a concern that the police would discover his drug paraphernalia\n\ncould be rationally rejected as entirely inconsistent with the fact\n\nof both consents.   Moreover, the police assured O'Laughlin that he\n\nwould not be prosecuted for any drug crimes if he voluntarily\n\nsurrendered any contraband to the police, further reducing the\n\ncredibility of O'Laughlin's explanation for his reluctance.\n\n            Whether a state court decision represents an unreasonable\n\napplication of clearly established federal law is a difficult\n\njudgment for a federal court to make.          The need for better\n\narticulation of the legal standards for making that judgment,\n\nparticularly where the record is largely circumstantial, in my\n\n\n                                - 16 -\n\fview, constitutes an appropriate basis on which to grant en banc\n\nreview.\n\nC.          The Panel Opinion's Method of Analysis\n\n            More    fundamentally,      the    panel    opinion's      method      of\n\nanalysis sets a dangerous precedent because it draws inferences\n\nagainst the jury's verdict and it takes a piecemeal approach to\n\nanalyzing the evidence.      That is, the panel opinion's approach to\n\nthe   sufficiency    question    in    operation    amounts       to   a   de    novo\n\nassessment of the record through which the court substitutes its\n\nown independent assessment of the record for the jury's evaluation.\n\nThis sort of analysis should be foreign to an appellate court,\n\nwhich has access only to a cold record.            And it is a particularly\n\ndangerous   exercise    in   a   case    like   this,     where    much     of    the\n\nprosecution's case depended on the testimony of witnesses and an\n\nassessment of the credibility of those witnesses.\n\n            Under    Jackson,    an     appellate       court     considering       a\n\nsufficiency challenge is not on an equal footing with the jury.\n\nInstead, \"the factfinder's role as weigher of the evidence is\n\npreserved through a legal conclusion that upon judicial review all\n\nof the evidence is to be considered in the light most favorable to\n\nthe prosecution.\" Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319 (emphasis in original).\n\n            The panel opinion, however, fails to respect the role of\n\nthe jury in deciding which evidence to credit and what reasonable\n\ninferences to draw from that evidence.                 For example, the panel\n\n\n                                      - 17 -\n\fopinion rejected the reasonable inference that Kotowski's assailant\n\nfled before taking anything of value from the apartment because he\n\nheard her upstairs neighbor on the telephone with the police.\n\nInstead, the panel held that \"no rational juror could conclude that\n\nthe placement of this phone call frightened him off given the\n\nvolume and duration of Mrs. Kotowski's screams.\"        O'Laughlin III,\n\n568 F.3d at 302.   Although it would be entirely permissible for a\n\njury to resist drawing this inference, an appellate court applying\n\nthe Jackson standard does not have the freedom to pick between\n\ncompeting reasonable inferences in this manner.       See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Ortiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202188\"><a href=\"/opinion/202188/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (1st Cir. 2006) (recognizing that\n\n\"competing   inferences   are   not   enough   to   disturb   the   jury's\n\nverdict,\" even in a case where the evidence of the defendant's\n\nguilt was \"entirely circumstantial\").\n\n          The panel opinion's method of analysis suffers from a\n\nrelated defect to the extent that it dismisses pieces of evidence\n\nby treating them in isolation, instead of considering the totality\n\nof the evidence together.   For example, the panel opinion resisted\n\nconcluding that a reasonable jury could consider that the aluminum\n\nbaseball bat that the police found in the woods twenty-five yards\n\nfrom Kotowski's apartment was evidence of O'Laughlin's guilt.         The\n\npanel dismissed this because \"any bat likely would have been\n\nconsistent with her injuries\" and because the upstairs neighbor had\n\ndescribed sounds like wood hitting on wood.         O'Laughlin III, 568\n\n\n                                - 18 -\n\fF.3d at 302. But the fact that Kotowski's injuries were consistent\n\nwith being beaten with a baseball bat is only one of the facts that\n\nwould have permitted a rational juror to conclude that the bat\n\nwhich the police found was the assailant's weapon.           The panel's\n\nanalysis ignores several other key facts relating to the bat, which\n\nhad been found in close proximity to the scene of the crime.\n\nO'Laughlin's name was inscribed on it, and O'Laughlin was closely\n\ntied to the crime by the prosecution's other evidence of his\n\nmotive, means, and consciousness of guilt.         The bat was hidden\n\nunder some leaves and debris as though someone had tried to\n\ncarefully conceal it.     And the bat was otherwise clean, suggesting\n\nthat it had not been in the woods for long and had been cleaned\n\noff.\n\n           This model of effectively performing de novo review\n\nrather than drawing inferences in favor of the verdict, if widely\n\nadopted,   would   have   unfortunate   consequences.   It    calls   for\n\nappellate courts to make determinations that are well beyond the\n\ninstitutional capacity of a court to do working from a cold record.\n\nAnd it conflicts with the usual rules of finality, effectively\n\ngiving criminal defendants multiple opportunities to make their\n\ncase in the first instance. Indeed, the government is particularly\n\nprejudiced when we overreach to decide these cases on sufficiency\n\ngrounds because principles of double jeopardy prevent the habeas\n\npetitioner from being retried.     See Evans v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203246\"><a href=\"/opinion/203246/evans-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n                                 - 19 -\n\f7 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"Sometimes double jeopardy principles mean the\n\nhabeas petitioner is simply released, as is done when the evidence\n\nof guilt is insufficient.\").\n\n                                     III.\n\n           Sufficiency questions are inherently fact-bound, and so\n\nmy disagreement with the panel opinion may appear, at first glance,\n\nto be a dispute over these facts with few implications beyond this\n\ncase.   But my concerns with the panel opinion run far deeper than\n\nthat. In my view, the panel's implicit adoption of the \"reasonable\n\nspeculation\" standard impermissibly alters our circuit's approach\n\nto   sufficiency    questions,      substantially   disadvantaging      whole\n\ncategories of cases -- like domestic and acquaintance violence\n\nprosecutions   --    where    the    government's   evidence      is   largely\n\ncircumstantial.      And     the    panel's   approach   sets    a   dangerous\n\nprecedent to the extent that it deviates from the narrow role\n\nCongress envisioned for federal habeas review under AEDPA by\n\nsubstituting the federal court's own independent assessment of the\n\nfacts for the state court's.\n\n           We have previously granted en banc review to address\n\nsimilarly important questions relating to the contours of federal\n\nhabeas review, see, e.g., McCambridge v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200144\"><a href=\"/opinion/200144/mccambridge-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (en banc), and I would do so again here.             Thus, with the\n\ngreatest respect for my colleagues, I dissent from the denial of en\n\nbanc review.   See United States v. Rivera, No. 95-2186, 1996 WL\n\n\n                                    - 20 -\n\f338379 (1st Cir. June 18, 1996) (Lynch, J., dissenting from the\n\ndenial of en banc review).\n\n\n\n                  \"Concurring Opinion Follows\"\n\n\n\n\n                             - 21 -\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, with LIPEZ, Circuit Judge,\n\nConcurring in the denial of en banc review.      I am forced to comment\n\non the dissent from the denial of en banc review because it\n\nmischaracterizes the reasoning of the unanimous panel opinion, an\n\nopinion which neither articulates nor applies a sufficiency of the\n\nevidence   test   inconsistent   with   the   Supreme   Court's   clearly\n\nestablished law under Jackson v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979). To\n\nsuggest that the panel opinion adopts \"reasonable speculation\" as\n\nsome sort of binding \"legal rule\" is incorrect.          We do not even\n\nmention the term in the section where we discuss the constitutional\n\nright asserted -- a section entitled \"The Jackson Standard,\"\n\nO'Laughlin v. O'Brien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203863\"><a href=\"/opinion/203863/olaughlin-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 300-02 (1st Cir. 2009) -- and\n\nwe consistently apply the Jackson standard to the facts of this\n\ncase.   When read in context, our use of the term \"reasonable\n\nspeculation\"      merely   frowns   upon      speculative   evidentiary\n\ninterpretations and in no way suggests that we disfavor the use of\n\ncircumstantial evidence.      In fact, with respect to this latter\n\npoint, we explicitly state that \"direct evidence of identification\n\nis not necessary,\" id. at 301 n.17, and quote our prior precedent\n\naffirming the use of circumstantial evidence, id.\n\n           In addition, the dissent mistakenly contends that the\n\npanel opinion engages in a piecemeal examination of the evidence.\n\nOur approach to deciding whether a jury could conclude that the\n\nevidence was sufficient to identify O'Laughlin as the assailant\n\n\n                                 - 22 -\n\funder Jackson is based on looking at the evidence as a whole.     We\n\nbegin and end our discussion of this evidence by stating that we\n\nconsider the evidence in its totality.       See id. at 302 (\"Taken\n\ntogether, the circumstantial evidence in this case, even when\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, does\n\nnot permit any rational jury to conclude that O'Laughlin was the\n\nassailant beyond a reasonable doubt.\"); id. at 304 (\"Given the\n\ninsufficiency of the evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, tying\n\nO'Laughlin to the attack, we conclude that a rational jury could\n\nnot find O'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"). In order\n\nto arrive at our conclusion that the evidence in its totality is\n\nnot sufficient to permit a rational jury to find O'Laughlin's guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, we necessarily had to consider the\n\nfactors the SJC weighed, namely evidence supporting O'Laughlin's\n\nmotive, opportunity, means, and consciousness of guilt.      This is\n\nconsistent with how we have dealt with sufficiency issues in the\n\npast.    See, e.g., Leftwich v. Maloney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203362\"><a href=\"/opinion/203362/leftwich-v-maloney/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25-27 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n            Finally, the dissent's contention that the panel opinion\n\nengages in a de novo review of the record is plainly wrong.      The\n\nopinion recounts the facts as presented by the SJC and holds,\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, that\n\nthe SJC was objectively unreasonable in concluding that O'Laughlin\n\nwas the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt. This approach was not\n\n\n                                - 23 -\n\flegal    error.   The   bottom   line   is   that   we   read   the   record\n\ndifferently than the dissent, not that we apply the wrong legal\n\nstandard.\n\n            As we state in the panel opinion, we fully appreciate\n\n\"the great degree of deference state court judgments are due,\n\nespecially those that uphold jury verdicts,\" O'Laughlin, 568 F.3d\n\nat 300, and \"the extremely high bar that must be overcome on habeas\n\nreview,\" id. at 304.       Despite this hurdle, however, in rare\n\ninstances there are fact-intensive cases where a state court's\n\ndetermination as to guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is so incorrect\n\nas to be objectively unreasonable.        A unanimous panel agreed that\n\nthis is such a case.1     With the utmost respect to our dissenting\n\ncolleague, the en banc court is correct in its decision to deny the\n\npetition for rehearing.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n        We also note that the Massachusetts Appeals Court, while\nadmittedly applying a different standard on direct review,\noverturned O'Laughlin's conviction, concluding that there was\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.\n\n                                 - 24 -\n\f</pre>",
