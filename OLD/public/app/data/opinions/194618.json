The question before us is whether the\n                    \n\ndistrict court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of\n\ndefendant  on various  claims  involving the  termination  of\n\nplaintiff's employment by the Defense Mapping Agency [\"DMA\"].\n\nAs we find  that the  Civil Service Reform  Act provides  the\n\nexclusive procedure  and remedies governing these  claims, we\n\naffirm the district court's disposition of the case.\n\n          Our review  of a district court's  grant of summary\n\njudgment is plenary.   See  Garside v. Osco  Drug, Inc.,  895\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1990).  Summary judgment is appropriate\n\nwhere the  record  reflects  \"no  genuine  issue  as  to  any\n\nmaterial  fact  and  ...  the moving  party  is  entitled  to\n\njudgment as a  matter of  law.\"  Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 56(c).   A\n\nperusal of the entire record, including the numerous exhibits\n\nappended   to  the   plaintiff's   complaint,  the   parties'\n\naffidavits, and motion papers, reveals the following sequence\n\nof events. \n\n          Appellant   was  employed   by  DMA  as   a  Marine\n\nInformation   Specialist.    His  appointment  was  effective\n\nSeptember  11,  1989,  subject  to a  one  year  probationary\n\nperiod.  On December 29,  1989, DMA terminated the employment\n\nbecause,  according to  DMA,  appellant refused  to accept  a\n\nsecurity clearance.  A  security clearance, DMA maintains, is\n\na requirement of the position.  \n\n                            - 2 -\n                             -2-\n\n           Appellant   appealed  his  removal  to  the  Merit\n\nSystems  Protection Board  [\"MSPB\"]  on the  ground that  the\n\nmanner in  which his employment had  been terminated, without\n\nnotice  and  an   opportunity  to  answer,   violated  agency\n\nregulations.    See  5   C.F.R.     315.805  (requiring  such\n                   \n\nprocedures  where  an  employee  is dismissed  for  a  reason\n\narising out of pre-employment events).  \n\n          Appellant acknowledged that  after he was hired  he\n\nrefused to sign the  document necessary to accept a  security\n\nclearance.  He also admitted sending a letter to the Director\n\nof  the DMA  in December,  1989, stating,  \"I do  not wish  a\n\nsecurity  clearance now or at any further date.\"  However, he\n\nargued that this refusal was the product of a pre-appointment\n\ncondition, to  wit, a lack  of knowledge  on his part  that a\n\nsecurity clearance was  required, attributable  to the  DMA's\n\nrepresentations  to that effect when he was offered the job. \n\n          Appellant  did  not deny  signing  a \"Statement  of\n\nUnderstanding,\" the day  his employment began,  acknowledging\n\nthe  security clearance requirement.  But he implied that the\n\nmanner  in   which  the  DMA  presented   the  \"Statement  of\n\nUnderstanding\" to him,  amid many other personnel  documents,\n\ncaused  him  to  overlook  its  contents.    Finally,  in  an\n\naffidavit  directed to the MSPB, appellant  stated, \"If I had\n\n                            - 3 -\n                             -3-\n\nbeen  informed that  the security  clearance was  mandatory I\n\nwould have accepted the clearance.\"   \n\n           The  MSPB  determined that  appellant's employment\n\nhad been terminated for  a \"post-appointment\" reason.  Since,\n\nwith few exceptions,  the MSPB has no  jurisdiction over such\n\nprobationary  period terminations,  it dismissed  the appeal.\n\nSee  5 C.F.R.   315.806(b)-(d).   The MSPB  also declined, in\n   \n\nlight of  this lack of jurisdiction,  to consider appellant's\n\nargument that  his First  Amendment rights had  been violated\n\nbecause his termination followed  on the heels of  his letter\n\ncomplaining about the  security clearance requirement.   MSPB\n\nNo.  DC 315H9010170 (Feb. 20, 1990).  The MSPB's decision was\n\naffirmed on  appeal to  the  circuit court,  and the  Supreme\n\nCourt  denied  certiorari,  and  a  rehearing.    Desmond  v.\n                                                         \n\nDepartment of Defense, 915 F.2d 1584 (Fed. Cir.  1990), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 111 S.  Ct. 792 (1991), reh'g denied, 111 S. Ct. 1030\n                                            \n\n(1991).    \n\n          Appellant then filed  this lawsuit in  the district\n\ncourt.  In a  complaint, and then an amended  complaint, both\n\nfiled  pro  se,  appellant   changed  his  factual  theories.\n              \n\nAppellant's first  complaint alleged that the  DMA originally\n\nhired him  for a non-sensitive position.   In December, 1989,\n\nhowever,  he discovered  that  he was  the  object of  covert\n\nsurveillance because, he alleged, the DMA was considering him\n\nfor  a  \"collateral  job  assignment\"  requiring  a  security\n\n                            - 4 -\n                             -4-\n\nclearance.  In contrast  to the affidavit he filed  with MSPB\n\n(\"if  I had  been  informed ...  I  would have  accepted  the\n\nclearance\"),  appellant's  district court  complaint asserted\n\nthat \"he did not wish any type of security clearance\" because\n                \n\nof a  prior experience in the Navy when, he said, he had been\n\nexposed  to  nerve gas  and  held  incommunicado against  his\n\nwishes.   He attributed  the DMA's subsequent  termination of\n\nhis employment  solely to retaliation for  his December, 1989\n\nletter objecting to the security clearance.1  \n\n          In  his amended  complaint appellant  again changed\n\nhis  factual  theory.2     This  time,  despite  his  earlier\n\ncharacterization of the December, 1989 letter as a product of\n\nmisunderstanding, his amended  complaint echoed the  letter's\n\ncontents.   It alleged that  the DMA had  hired appellant for\n\nthe very  purpose of conducting  a \"witch hunt\"  against him,\n\n                    \n\n1.      In addition to the MSPB action, appellant's complaint\nalso alleged that he  had filed an action with the EEOC which\nwas  dismissed   as  untimely.     Exhibits  submitted   with\nappellant's various motion papers  also refer to one or  more\nadditional actions involving  the same facts,  brought before\nthe State's unemployment  compensation office  and the  state\ncourts.   In a \"Reply to  Defendant's Answer,\" appellant also\nrefers  to  two  additional  appeals to  the  MSPB  involving\ndenials of employment by  other government agencies connected\nto the instant termination. \n\n2.     The record before us does not indicate a direct ruling\non appellant's  motion to  amend his  complaint.   Since  the\ndistrict  court  referred to  the  amended  complaint in  its\ndecision  dismissing  the  case,   we  read  its  opinion  as\neffectively  granting  the  motion   to  amend  and  treating\ndefendant's  summary  judgment  motion  as  directed  to both\ncomplaints. \n\n                            - 5 -\n                             -5-\n\n\"under the disguise  of a security clearance  investigation.\"\n\nThis  \"witch  hunt,\"  appellant   said,  was  a  response  to\n\ncomplaints he had made to Congress about his treatment in the\n\nNavy,  where,  he  reiterated,  he  had  been  exposed  to  a\n\nchemical-biological nerve agent and \"held  political prisoner\n\nto  cover-up  that  fact.\"    Moreover,  appellant's  amended\n\ncomplaint  now  seemingly  denied   the  genuineness  of  his\n\nsignature on the  \"Statement of  Understanding,\" alleging  it\n\nwas \"obviously\" an altered or forged document.\n\n         Without characterizing  apellant's claims precisely,\n\nit  appears he  is now  seeking to  assert tort  and contract\n\nclaims,  including  claims  for   violations  of  his   first\n\namendment,  privacy and  due process  rights.   See generally\n                                                             \n\nBivens v. Six Unknown Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,\n                                                            \n\n403 U.S.  388 (1971).  Appellant  demands reinstatement, back\n\npay  plus interest, a full  evidentiary hearing on the merits\n\nof his termination, and $100,000 in compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages.  \n\n          Appellee  challenged  the   legal  sufficiency   of\n\nappellant's claims on numerous grounds, including preemption,\n\nres  judicata and  collateral  estoppel, sovereign  immunity,\n\nfailure  to file a proper claim under the Federal Tort Claims\n\nAct, and  the absence of an  enforceable employment contract.\n\nWe  do not  need  to reach  most  of these  issues,  however,\n\nbecause no matter how appellant's claims are styled, they are\n\n                            - 6 -\n                             -6-\n\nprecluded by  the exclusivity of the  remedies and procedures\n\nprovided in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 [\"CSRA\"] and\n\nthe Whistleblower's Protection Act of 1989. \n\n          \"The  CSRA  was meant  to  provide a  comprehensive\n\nframework   for   personnel   policies    governing   federal\n\nemployees.\"   Roth v. United  States, 952 F.2d  611, 614 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1991); see also  Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367 (1983).\n                                   \n\n          The  legislative  history  of   the  CSRA\n          establishes beyond  dispute that Congress\n          intended  that  statute  to   provide  an\n          exclusive   procedure   for   challenging\n          federal  personnel   decisions  ....  The\n          history  and intent  of the  CSRA plainly\n          prefigures that collateral district court\n          jurisdiction would impede  the ideals  of\n          fast,  efficient  management and  greater\n          uniformity   in   the   judicial   review\n          process.\n\nRoth, 952 F.2d at  615 (quoting Berrios v. Department  of the\n                                                             \n\nArmy,  884 F.2d  28,  31-32  (1st  Cir.  1989)).

Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412, 427-28 (1988). \n                     \n\n          Exclusivity of the remedial scheme provided by  the\n\nCSRA   is  necessary  to  effectuate  the  statutory  design,\n\n\"balanc[ing]   the  legitimate   interests  of   the  various\n\ncategories of federal  employees with the needs of  sound and\n\nefficient regulation.\"  United States v.

To avoid  \"inconcinnous judicial  incursions\" into\n\nthis carefully  constructed  regulatory structure,  CSRA  has\n\nbeen  held to preclude a wide  variety of Bivens-type actions\n                                                \n\nand  other federal law claims.

See Kotarski,\n                                                            \n\n866 F.2d at  311; Saul, 928 F.2d at 837,  840-41.  Management\n                      \n\nconcerns necessarily require great flexibility in determining\n\nto whom to  grant permanent  status.

See  5  C.F.R.     315.805,  315.806(c).   A  direct\n            \n\nappeal to  the MSPB  is also  permitted to  challenge actions\n\nbased  on \"partisan political affiliation or marital status.\"\n\n5 C.F.R.   315.908(b).  \n\n          Congress  has  recently  sought to  strengthen  the\n\nadministrative  protections  accorded probationary  employees\n\nwho  speak out  against mismanagement  and waste  through the\n\n\"Whistleblower's   Protection  Act\"  of   1989.     With  the\n\namendments included  in that Act, Congress  provided \"what it\n\nconsiders  adequate  remedial   mechanisms\"  for   redressing\n\nconstitutional  violations.   Kotarski,  866  F.2d   at  312.\n                                      \n\nProbationary employees are given the right to seek corrective\n\naction   for  prohibited   personnel  practices   through  an\n\nindependent Office  of Special Counsel.   The Special Counsel\n\nis  empowered to receive  complaints, investigate, and, where\n\nthere are reasonable grounds, seek correction of a variety of\n\nconstitutional violations, including, notably,  complaints of\n\nabuse of authority.   5 U.S.C.    1211,  1213, 1214(a)(1)(2),\n\n1216,  2302(b)(8).    At   the  termination  of  the  Special\n\nCounsel's inquiry,  the probationary  employee may  appeal to\n\nthe MSPB.  And if the  Special Counsel fails to terminate his\n\ninquiry within  120 days  after receiving the  complaint, the\n\nprobationary employee may appeal directly to MSPB.   5 U.S.C.\n\n   1214(2)(B)(3), 1214(3).  \n\n                            - 9 -\n                             -9-\n\n          Appellant points to the jurisdictional dismissal of\n\nthe claim  he  filed with  the  MSPB as  demonstrating  that,\n\ndespite this scheme,  in practice the CSRA  provides no means\n\nto redress  the  constitutional  violations  alleged  in  his\n\ndistrict court  complaints.   But, we  do not  understand the\n\nagency's action in this way.  First, the MSPB's dismissal was\n\nbased on facts and theories very different from those alleged\n\nhere.   Second, even  if, properly presented,  the MSPB would\n\nhave  had no jurisdiction over an appeal based on the instant\n\nfactual theories,  (although appellant had the  right to seek\n\nrelief from the Special Counsel's office). \n\n          Appellant also denies  the Special Counsel's actual\n\nauthority citing a  telegram he sent  to the Special  Counsel\n\nwhich allegedly was not answered.   The meaning and relevance\n\nof  the  allegations in  appellant's  telegram  are far  from\n\nclear.   But even  indulging appellant's  interpretation, and\n\nviewing the telegram as a formal complaint, it does not prove\n\nhis  point.   The Act  clearly permitted appellant  a further\n\nadministrative avenue for pursuing constitutional complaints,\n\nregardless  of  any  inadvertent   inaction  by  the  Special\n\nCounsel's office. \n\n          Although  Congress has  vested  discretion  in  the\n\nOffice of  Special Counsel  and the  MSPB, we  have elsewhere\n\nobserved  that \"even  where the  CSRA provides  no guaranteed\n\nforum,  preemption  of   ...  work-related  tort   claims  is\n\n                            - 10 -\n                             -10-\n\nnecessary to  fulfill congressional intent.\"   Roth, 952 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat  615 (quoting Saul, 928 F.2d at 843).  Appellant's showing\n                     \n\nfalls far  short of demonstrating that  the CSRA's regulatory\n\nscheme does not provide a reasonable mechanism for protecting\n\nagainst the class of constitutional violations alleged here.\n\n          We have  also considered appellant's  other grounds\n\nfor appeal and find them without merit.\n\n          Accordingly, the judgment of the  district court is\n\naffirmed. \n         \n\n                            - 11 -\n                             -11-\n",

Summary judgment is appropriate\n\nwhere the  record  reflects  \"no  genuine  issue  as  to  any\n\nmaterial  fact  and  ...  the moving  party  is  entitled  to\n\njudgment as a  matter of  law.\"  Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 56(c).   A\n\nperusal of the entire record, including the numerous exhibits\n\nappended   to  the   plaintiff's   complaint,  the   parties'\n\naffidavits, and motion papers, reveals the following sequence\n\nof events. \n\n          Appellant   was  employed   by  DMA  as   a  Marine\n\nInformation   Specialist.    His  appointment  was  effective\n\nSeptember  11,  1989,  subject  to a  one  year  probationary\n\nperiod.  On December 29,  1989, DMA terminated the employment\n\nbecause,  according to  DMA,  appellant refused  to accept  a\n\nsecurity clearance.  A  security clearance, DMA maintains, is\n\na requirement of the position.  \n\n                            - 2 -\n                             -2-\n\n           Appellant   appealed  his  removal  to  the  Merit\n\nSystems  Protection Board  [\"MSPB\"]  on the  ground that  the\n\nmanner in  which his employment had  been terminated, without\n\nnotice  and  an   opportunity  to  answer,   violated  agency\n\nregulations.    See  5   C.F.R.     315.805  (requiring  such\n                   \n\nprocedures  where  an  employee  is dismissed  for  a  reason\n\narising out of pre-employment events).  \n\n          Appellant acknowledged that  after he was hired  he\n\nrefused to sign the  document necessary to accept a  security\n\nclearance.  He also admitted sending a letter to the Director\n\nof  the DMA  in December,  1989, stating,  \"I do  not wish  a\n\nsecurity  clearance now or at any further date.\"  However, he\n\nargued that this refusal was the product of a pre-appointment\n\ncondition, to  wit, a lack  of knowledge  on his part  that a\n\nsecurity clearance was  required, attributable  to the  DMA's\n\nrepresentations  to that effect when he was offered the job. \n\n          Appellant  did  not deny  signing  a \"Statement  of\n\nUnderstanding,\" the day  his employment began,  acknowledging\n\nthe  security clearance requirement.  But he implied that the\n\nmanner  in   which  the  DMA  presented   the  \"Statement  of\n\nUnderstanding\" to him,  amid many other personnel  documents,\n\ncaused  him  to  overlook  its  contents.    Finally,  in  an\n\naffidavit  directed to the MSPB, appellant  stated, \"If I had\n\n                            - 3 -\n                             -3-\n\nbeen  informed that  the security  clearance was  mandatory I\n\nwould have accepted the clearance.\"   \n\n           The  MSPB  determined that  appellant's employment\n\nhad been terminated for  a \"post-appointment\" reason.  Since,\n\nwith few exceptions,  the MSPB has no  jurisdiction over such\n\nprobationary  period terminations,  it dismissed  the appeal.\n\nSee  5 C.F.R.   315.806(b)-(d).   The MSPB  also declined, in\n   \n\nlight of  this lack of jurisdiction,  to consider appellant's\n\nargument that  his First  Amendment rights had  been violated\n\nbecause his termination followed  on the heels of  his letter\n\ncomplaining about the  security clearance requirement.   MSPB\n\nNo.  DC 315H9010170 (Feb. 20, 1990).  The MSPB's decision was\n\naffirmed on  appeal to  the  circuit court,  and the  Supreme\n\nCourt  denied  certiorari,  and  a  rehearing.

In a  complaint, and then an amended  complaint, both\n\nfiled  pro  se,  appellant   changed  his  factual  theories.\n              \n\nAppellant's first  complaint alleged that the  DMA originally\n\nhired him  for a non-sensitive position.   In December, 1989,\n\nhowever,  he discovered  that  he was  the  object of  covert\n\nsurveillance because, he alleged, the DMA was considering him\n\nfor  a  \"collateral  job  assignment\"  requiring  a  security\n\n                            - 4 -\n                             -4-\n\nclearance.  In contrast  to the affidavit he filed  with MSPB\n\n(\"if  I had  been  informed ...  I  would have  accepted  the\n\nclearance\"),  appellant's  district court  complaint asserted\n\nthat \"he did not wish any type of security clearance\" because\n                \n\nof a  prior experience in the Navy when, he said, he had been\n\nexposed  to  nerve gas  and  held  incommunicado against  his\n\nwishes.   He attributed  the DMA's subsequent  termination of\n\nhis employment  solely to retaliation for  his December, 1989\n\nletter objecting to the security clearance.1  \n\n          In  his amended  complaint appellant  again changed\n\nhis  factual  theory.2     This  time,  despite  his  earlier\n\ncharacterization of the December, 1989 letter as a product of\n\nmisunderstanding, his amended  complaint echoed the  letter's\n\ncontents.   It alleged that  the DMA had  hired appellant for\n\nthe very  purpose of conducting  a \"witch hunt\"  against him,\n\n                    \n\n1.      In addition to the MSPB action, appellant's complaint\nalso alleged that he  had filed an action with the EEOC which\nwas  dismissed   as  untimely.     Exhibits  submitted   with\nappellant's various motion papers  also refer to one or  more\nadditional actions involving  the same facts,  brought before\nthe State's unemployment  compensation office  and the  state\ncourts.   In a \"Reply to  Defendant's Answer,\" appellant also\nrefers  to  two  additional  appeals to  the  MSPB  involving\ndenials of employment by  other government agencies connected\nto the instant termination. \n\n2.     The record before us does not indicate a direct ruling\non appellant's  motion to  amend his  complaint.   Since  the\ndistrict  court  referred to  the  amended  complaint in  its\ndecision  dismissing  the  case,   we  read  its  opinion  as\neffectively  granting  the  motion   to  amend  and  treating\ndefendant's  summary  judgment  motion  as  directed  to both\ncomplaints. \n\n                            - 5 -\n                             -5-\n\n\"under the disguise  of a security clearance  investigation.\"\n\nThis  \"witch  hunt,\"  appellant   said,  was  a  response  to\n\ncomplaints he had made to Congress about his treatment in the\n\nNavy,  where,  he  reiterated,  he  had  been  exposed  to  a\n\nchemical-biological nerve agent and \"held  political prisoner\n\nto  cover-up  that  fact.\"    Moreover,  appellant's  amended\n\ncomplaint  now  seemingly  denied   the  genuineness  of  his\n\nsignature on the  \"Statement of  Understanding,\" alleging  it\n\nwas \"obviously\" an altered or forged document.\n\n         Without characterizing  apellant's claims precisely,\n\nit  appears he  is now  seeking to  assert tort  and contract\n\nclaims,  including  claims  for   violations  of  his   first\n\namendment,  privacy and  due process  rights.

See Kotarski,\n                                                            \n\n866 F.2d at  311; Saul, 928 F.2d at 837,  840-41.

See  5  C.F.R.     315.805,  315.806(c).   A  direct\n            \n\nappeal to  the MSPB  is also  permitted to  challenge actions\n\nbased  on \"partisan political affiliation or marital status.\"\n\n5 C.F.R.   315.908(b).  \n\n          Congress  has  recently  sought to  strengthen  the\n\nadministrative  protections  accorded probationary  employees\n\nwho  speak out  against mismanagement  and waste  through the\n\n\"Whistleblower's   Protection  Act\"  of   1989.     With  the\n\namendments included  in that Act, Congress  provided \"what it\n\nconsiders  adequate  remedial   mechanisms\"  for   redressing\n\nconstitutional  violations.   Kotarski,  866  F.2d   at  312.\n                                      \n\nProbationary employees are given the right to seek corrective\n\naction   for  prohibited   personnel  practices   through  an\n\nindependent Office  of Special Counsel.   The Special Counsel\n\nis  empowered to receive  complaints, investigate, and, where\n\nthere are reasonable grounds, seek correction of a variety of\n\nconstitutional violations, including, notably,  complaints of\n\nabuse of authority.   5 U.S.C.    1211,  1213, 1214(a)(1)(2),\n\n1216,  2302(b)(8).    At   the  termination  of  the  Special\n\nCounsel's inquiry,  the probationary  employee may  appeal to\n\nthe MSPB.  And if the  Special Counsel fails to terminate his\n\ninquiry within  120 days  after receiving the  complaint, the\n\nprobationary employee may appeal directly to MSPB.   5 U.S.C.\n\n   1214(2)(B)(3), 1214(3).  \n\n                            - 9 -\n                             -9-\n\n          Appellant points to the jurisdictional dismissal of\n\nthe claim  he  filed with  the  MSPB as  demonstrating  that,\n\ndespite this scheme,  in practice the CSRA  provides no means\n\nto redress  the  constitutional  violations  alleged  in  his\n\ndistrict court  complaints.   But, we  do not  understand the\n\nagency's action in this way.  First, the MSPB's dismissal was\n\nbased on facts and theories very different from those alleged\n\nhere.   Second, even  if, properly presented,  the MSPB would\n\nhave  had no jurisdiction over an appeal based on the instant\n\nfactual theories,  (although appellant had the  right to seek\n\nrelief from the Special Counsel's office). \n\n          Appellant also denies  the Special Counsel's actual\n\nauthority citing a  telegram he sent  to the Special  Counsel\n\nwhich allegedly was not answered.   The meaning and relevance\n\nof  the  allegations in  appellant's  telegram  are far  from\n\nclear.   But even  indulging appellant's  interpretation, and\n\nviewing the telegram as a formal complaint, it does not prove\n\nhis  point.   The Act  clearly permitted appellant  a further\n\nadministrative avenue for pursuing constitutional complaints,\n\nregardless  of  any  inadvertent   inaction  by  the  Special\n\nCounsel's office. \n\n          Although  Congress has  vested  discretion  in  the\n\nOffice of  Special Counsel  and the  MSPB, we  have elsewhere\n\nobserved  that \"even  where the  CSRA provides  no guaranteed\n\nforum,  preemption  of   ...  work-related  tort   claims  is\n\n                            - 10 -\n                             -10-\n\nnecessary to  fulfill congressional intent.\"   Roth, 952 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat  615 (quoting Saul, 928 F.2d at 843).  Appellant's showing\n                     \n\nfalls far  short of demonstrating that  the CSRA's regulatory\n\nscheme does not provide a reasonable mechanism for protecting\n\nagainst the class of constitutional violations alleged here.\n\n          We have  also considered appellant's  other grounds\n\nfor appeal and find them without merit.\n\n          Accordingly, the judgment of the  district court is\n\naffirmed. \n         \n\n                            - 11 -\n                             -11-\n</pre>",
