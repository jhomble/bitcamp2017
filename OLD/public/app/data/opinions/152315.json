Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           SOUTER, Associate Justice.   The appellee Metropolitan\n\nYacht Club, Inc. is a non-profit association of voluntary members.\n\nAppellant Phillip R. Martin and other members of the Club applied\n\nand paid for winter wet storage of their boats on Club premises,\n\nwhere a fire that broke out there destroyed several boats and\n\ndamaged others.     State investigators concluded that the fire\n\noriginated in faulty wiring beneath the dock adjacent to Martin’s\n\nboat; but Martin, concerned about possible claims against him,\n\npetitioned the district court for a decree exonerating him or\n\nlimiting his liability under maritime law, 46 U.S.C. § 30501 et\n\nseq.   The judicial proceedings ballooned as more Club members with\n\ndamaged boats and various insurers joined in, asserting claims\n\nagainst Martin, the Club, or both.\n\n           Eventually the Club moved for summary judgment that it\n\nwas liable to no one, including Martin, under governing maritime\n\nlaw, owing to the fact that members were subject to the following\n\nClub by-law:\n\n           “The Club expressly absolves itself . . . and\n           each member agrees that the Club may absolve\n           itself from any liability for damages to any\n           boat, property, appurtenances and contents\n           thereof . . . .        Said absolution from\n           liability shall include but not be limited to:\n           (a) Fire; (b) Theft; (c) Vandalism; (d) Water\n           Damage; (e) Negligent acts or omissions.”\n\nA magistrate judge granted the motion, and Martin and others\n\nbrought this interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(3). On\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fde novo review, Rosario v. Dept. of Army, 607 F.3d 241, 246 (1st\n\nCir. 2010), we affirm.\n\n           There is no claim that the Club was at greater fault than\n\nsimple negligence, so the issue is over the effectiveness of the\n\nby-law term of exculpation from negligence liability for property\n\ndamage to a Club member.       No maritime case in this circuit is\n\ndirectly on point, although the leading opinion (dealing with\n\nexculpatory language in commercial circumstances) addresses two\n\npoints of maritime law of interest here: (1) “an exculpatory clause\n\nlimited to barring liability for ordinary negligence would be\n\nvalid, assuming it were not inflicted by a monopolist or one with\n\ngreatly superior bargaining power”; and (2) a court may sever or\n\ndivide   an   overbroad   clause,   “retaining   those    provisions   or\n\napplications of them that are permissible.”       Broadley v. Mashpee\n\nNeck Marina, Inc., 471 F. 3d 272, 274, 275 (1st Cir. 2006).        While\n\nthe court did not sever the clause then at issue, it observed that\n\n“[a]ny competent lawyer could write a straightforward exclusion of\n\nliability for negligence that we would sustain.”         Id. at 276.\n\n           Our road to decision is not as short as this considered\n\ndictum might suggest, however, given some details said to be in\n\ntension with a “straightforward” classification for the exclusion\n\nhere.    The owners and insurers make much of the fact that the\n\nexculpation clause is contained in a by-law that was bargained for\n\nneither when the boat owners joined the Club, nor when they applied\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\ffor winter storage of the boats.         They portray themselves as the\n\nweaker   contracting   parties   outmatched    by   the   Club’s   “greatly\n\nsuperior bargaining power.”      But it would be unfair to compare the\n\nclause here either to one inflicted, or to one devised by a\n\nmonopolist to extract a benefit from a helpless counterparty.            As\n\nan initial matter, there is no monopoly on boat storage; commercial\n\nmarinas may be found nearby the Club’s premises.           Yet there is a\n\nmore fundamental feature of this case in the relationship between\n\nan association and its members that makes the Club’s initial\n\nbargaining power less significant than it would be in a standard\n\ncommercial transaction.    The limit on liability is one of several\n\nterms of a compact of the members with each other to limit the cost\n\nof membership,1 and every prospective member who joins immediately\n\nshares in its benefits.    And by the very nature of such a compact,\n\nthe by-laws are voted on by the Club membership, and the limitation\n\non liability is open to revision by Club members (never attempted\n\nby the boat owners here).         Membership agreements of voluntary\n\nassociations like the Club were not what the Broadley panel had in\n\nmind when it spoke of monopolies and other situations of uneven\n\nbargaining power.2\n\n\n     1\n       Another is the requirement that all members annually\ncontribute eight hours of personal labor (or pay the Club $25.00\nfor each hour not worked).\n     2\n       Cf. Post v. Belmont Country Club, Inc., 60 Mass. App. Ct.\n645, 649-50, 805 N.E.2d 63, 68-69 (2004) (noting that the indemnity\nclause in a club’s by-laws “was in fact more likely to have worked\n\n                                   -4-\n\f                Objection is also made to the omission of the by-law from\n\nthe written terms of the “Winter Storage Application” itself (in\n\ncontrast to the standard summer slip rental form).                      But the\n\nappellants’       attempt   to   rely   exclusively   on   the   text   of   the\n\napplication is misplaced.           The by-laws govern the relationship\n\nbetween its members and the Club, and these make binding upon all\n\nmembers     a    rule   specifically    governing   application   for    winter\n\nstorage.3       It is simply not reasonable to assert that submission of\n\nsuch an application proposed a contractual relationship wholly\n\ndistinct from membership.         Nor do the appellants fare any better\n\nwith their suggestion that the Club was deficient in bringing the\n\nby-laws to members’ notice at any time.         Since there is no question\n\nthat the by-laws were readily available, no more need be said,\n\ngiven our agreement with the Massachusetts common law rule that a\n\nmember generally is responsible for knowing his organization’s by-\n\nlaws.    Post v. Belmont Country Club, Inc., 60 Mass. App. Ct. 645,\n\n648-49, 805 N.E.2d 63, 67-68 (2004).\n\n\n\nin [an individual member’s favor] than not, shielding him and the\nother members from increased dues related to payment of claims or\nadditional insurance costs” and reasoning that “[b]ecause members\nretain . . . constant opportunity to ‘negotiate’ changes in the\nmembership agreement, [such a contract] differs substantially from\nthat where a consumer, in order to acquire needed goods and\nservices, is required to accept its terms on a take it or leave it\nbasis”).\n     3\n       That rule, consistent with the limitation of liability by-\nlaw, provides (among other things) that boat owners assume the risk\nof property damage.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f            Next, the objectors point out that the exculpatory clause\n\nhere may be read as going beyond what the court in Broadley thought\n\nwas acceptable, since the “absolution” is not limited to simple\n\nnegligence; it also applies by reference to specific sources of\n\ndamage (fire, etc.) without reference to degree of fault.            While\n\nthis is true, any supposedly excessive favor to the Club may be\n\npared down by a process of severance so long as the clause was\n\ndevised in good faith and obtained in accordance with reasonable\n\nstandards of fair dealing.       Broadley, 471 F.2d at 275 (quoting\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 184).           Both conditions are\n\nsatisfied here.    What has already been said about the nature and\n\npurpose of the amendable by-law answers any question about good\n\nfaith, and the consistency with fair dealing is shown by its\n\nclarity in expressly excluding ordinary negligence, whatever else\n\nit may purport to do.     See id. (clear and specific disclaimer of\n\nnegligence   liability   would   be   likely   to   convey   an   effective\n\nwarning).\n\n            Remaining arguments based on standards for reforming\n\ndefective contract documents are beside the point here.           The Club\n\ndoes not seek reformation for failure of a document to express the\n\ntrue agreement, and the by-law is not just another conventional\n\ncontract between parties bound solely by commercial terms of\n\nagreement. Indeed, the very fact that the contractual relationship\n\nit governs is between an association and its voluntary members so\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\ffar distinguishes this case from one (such as Broadley) involving\n\na purely business relationship as to admit of a question whether a\n\nmembership corporation in circumstances like these may effectively\n\ncontract   out   of    liability   for    greater   fault   than   ordinary\n\nnegligence.   But that issue is not before us.4\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       Nor are there any issues about application of the by-law to\ncontract as distinct from tort liability, or to the bailment\nrelationship, matters ruled upon by the magistrate judge but not\npursued here.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

Indeed, the very fact that the contractual relationship\n\nit governs is between an association and its voluntary members so\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\ffar distinguishes this case from one (such as Broadley) involving\n\na purely business relationship as to admit of a question whether a\n\nmembership corporation in circumstances like these may effectively\n\ncontract   out   of    liability   for    greater   fault   than   ordinary\n\nnegligence.   But that issue is not before us.4\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       Nor are there any issues about application of the by-law to\ncontract as distinct from tort liability, or to the bailment\nrelationship, matters ruled upon by the magistrate judge but not\npursued here.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f</pre>",
