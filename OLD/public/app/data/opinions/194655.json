In  this appeal,  a family  of\n          SELYA, Circuit  Judge.\n                               \n\ndisappointed plaintiffs asks us  to overturn the district court's\n\nentry  of judgment on a counterclaim and to annul awards covering\n\nattorneys'  fees and sanctions.   Finding no cognizable error, we\n\naffirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          In  early  1989,  Catherine   M.  Jones  and  her  son,\n\nAlexander  T. Jones, filed suit to recover amounts allegedly owed\n\nby Reid S. Littlefield  in consequence of Littlefield's agreement\n\nto  rent a vacation home in Gilford, New Hampshire.  Littlefield,\n\nthrough  counsel, answered the  complaint and  counterclaimed for\n\nbreach of contract,  assault, and  trespass.1  In  response to  a\n\npretrial  order, the  two  original plaintiffs  filed an  amended\n\ncomplaint  in which they  joined David A. Jones,  an owner of the\n\nproperty  and a signatory to the lease, as a co-plaintiff.2  Soon\n\nthereafter, plaintiffs' attorney moved to withdraw from the case.\n\nOn  January 2,  1990,  the magistrate-judge  allowed the  motion.\n\nFrom  that point forward, David  Jones served as  his own counsel\n\nand at times represented his co-plaintiffs.\n\n                    \n\n     1Appellants' suit  named a myriad  of other defendants.   In\nthe  present  posture of  the case,  no  useful purpose  would be\nserved by furnishing details relevant to these persons and firms.\n\n     2David Jones is Catherine's  husband and Alexander's father.\nHe  is also  an  attorney.    He  represents  the  appellants  in\nconnection with this appeal.   We note in passing  that, although\nAlexander Jones is  listed in  the notice of  appeal, brief,  and\nother documents as  an appellant, he  is seemingly unaffected  by\nany  of the  orders  under review.    We, therefore,  ignore  his\npresence  and treat Catherine and David Jones as if they were the\nsole appellants.\n\n                                2\n\n          In April  1990, appellants withdrew most  of the causes\n\nof  action originally  asserted against  Littlefield.   Buoyed by\n\nthis concession, Littlefield moved to dismiss on the  ground that\n\nthere was no longer a sufficient amount in controversy.  Although\n\nthe  court  denied  Littlefield's  motion  and  gave   appellants\n\npermission  to  supplement their  pleadings,  appellants made  no\n\neffort  to cure the perceived  deficiency.3  On  August 27, 1990,\n\nthe court dismissed their complaint.\n\n          Claiming  that they  had never  received notice  of the\n\nopportunity  to amend  their  pleadings, and  denying (despite  a\n\nclear record to the contrary) that they had withdrawn their other\n\ncauses  of action,  appellants sought  and obtained  the district\n\ncourt's agreement  to reconsider.   The  court withheld entry  of\n\njudgment and set a reconsideration  hearing for January 7,  1991.\n\nThe  appellants did not attend.  Instead, they notified the court\n\na  week  beforehand  that  Catherine  Jones's  medical  condition\n\nprecluded travel from  Pennsylvania to New Hampshire.   The court\n\ncontinued the  hearing until June 24,  1991.  On  that date, only\n\nDavid Jones  appeared, claiming that a  daughter's sudden illness\n\nprevented  his  wife's attendance.    The  court rescheduled  the\n\nhearing  for April  6,  1992, but  warned  appellants that  their\n\nfailure to attend  on the new date  would result in dismissal  of\n\nthe complaint and, possibly, additional sanctions.\n\n                    \n\n     3We use the  term \"perceived deficiency\" advisedly.   As the\ndistrict  court  recognized,  the  amount  in   controversy,  for\npurposes of  federal diversity jurisdiction, is  determined as of\nthe time the case is  first commenced.  See Klepper v.  First Am.\n                                                                 \nBank, 916 F.2d 337, 340 (6th Cir. 1990).\n    \n\n                                3\n\n          Notwithstanding  the  court's admonition,  no plaintiff\n\nappeared on  April 6.   Appellants  did not  communicate directly\n\nwith the court but  sent a facsimile transmittal to  their former\n\nattorney  explaining that illness  supposedly prevented them from\n\nattending.  Its patience exhausted,  the district court acted  on\n\nits  earlier dismissal of the complaint and entered judgment.  On\n\nMay   5,  1992,   the   court  denied   appellants'  motion   for\n\nreconsideration  and, at  the  same  time, granted  Littlefield's\n\nmotion for entry  of a  default in respect  to the  counterclaim.\n\nThe court fixed  June 3, 1992 for  a dual-purpose hearing  (i) to\n\ndetermine  damages  on the  counterclaim,  see  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.\n                                              \n\n55(b)(2), (d),  and (ii) to  consider the possible  imposition of\n\nsanctions.  Although appellants  did not show up  for the June  3\n\nhearing, the court received evidence and reserved decision.\n\n          On  September 8,  1992, the  court awarded  Littlefield\n\n$2,000  on  the  counterclaim's   assault  count,  dismissed  the\n\nremaining counts of the counterclaim (finding Littlefield's proof\n\nof  damages inadequate), awarded  Littlefield attorneys'  fees in\n\nthe  amount of  $6,338.80, and  fined Mr.  and Mrs.  Jones $5,000\n\napiece for  their consistent failure to  attend pretrial hearings\n\nand  their bad faith in  conducting the litigation.   This appeal\n\nfollowed.     \n\nII.  DISCUSSION\n\n          Having  studied the  record, we  conclude that  none of\n\nappellants' contentions  merit  relief from  the  various  orders\n\nentered  below.  In explaining why this is so, we comment briefly\n\n                                4\n\non four of appellants' principal points.\n\n                    A.  The Matter of Status.\n                                            \n\n          Throughout most  of  this litigation,  David Jones  has\n\ncharacterized himself as an  \"involuntary plaintiff.\"  On appeal,\n\nhe  maintains this  characterization, arguing  that, as  such, he\n\ncannot be forced to pay sanctions.  We do not  think that Jones's\n\npoint is properly preserved.\n\n          To be  sure, Jones is  an involuntary plaintiff  in the\n\nsense that, on August 28, 1989, the magistrate-judge ordered  the\n\ntwo  original plaintiffs to join him.  (Given his relationship to\n\nthe  property and  the  lease, he  was  a necessary,  perhaps  an\n\nindispensable,  party,  see  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  19.)    However,\n                           \n\nsubsequent to joinder, Jones made several personal appearances in\n\nthe case and also made a number of written submissions.  While he\n\nstyled himself at various times as an \"involuntary plaintiff,\" he\n\nnever asked the district court to drop him as a party.  That ends\n\nthe matter.  In this  circuit, \"it is a party's  first obligation\n\nto  seek any relief that might fairly have been thought available\n\nin the district court before seeking it on appeal.\"   Beaulieu v.\n                                                              \n\nUnited States  Internal Revenue Serv.,  865 F.2d 1351,  1352 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1989); accord  Dartmouth Rev. v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n13, 22 (1st Cir. 1989);  Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 862  F.2d 890,\n                                                 \n\n896 (1st Cir. 1988).  Thus, here, neither the question of whether\n\nit  was error for the magistrate-judge to direct that David Jones\n\nbe joined as  a plaintiff,  nor the related  question of  whether\n\n                                5\n\nJones participated in the suit under unfair compulsion, is before\n\nus.4\n\n                  B. The Assessment of Damages.\n                                               \n\n          We next consider Catherine Jones's contention  that the\n\ndistrict court improperly assessed damages against her in the sum\n\nof $2,000.  The  record discloses that, after entering  a default\n\non the  counterclaims, the  district court scheduled  a proof-of-\n\nclaim  hearing for June 3, 1992, directed Littlefield to submit a\n\nfull  accounting   of  his  damages  in   advance,  and  directed\n\nappellants  to respond  to  this submission  before the  hearing.\n\nLittlefield filed a written statement of damages and a supporting\n\nmemorandum.   The appellants filed nothing.   They also boycotted\n\nthe June  3  hearing.   In  contrast,  Littlefield  appeared  and\n\ntestified.  Based upon the evidence before it, the district court\n\nawarded Littlefield $2,000 in  damages against Catherine Jones on\n\nthe assault counterclaim.\n\n          Once the  entry of  a default establishes  the fact  of\n                                                             \n\ndamage, the  trial judge,  sitting without  a jury in  a Rule  55\n\nproceeding, has  considerable latitude in  determining the amount\n                                                                 \n\nof damages.  See Sony  Corp. v. Elm State Elecs., Inc.,  800 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n317,  321  (2d  Cir.   1986)  (reviewing  assessment  of  damages\n\nfollowing entry  of  default  for abuse  of  discretion).    This\n\nstandard dictates  the  result in  the  present situation.    The\n\n                    \n\n     4Moreover,  Jones seems  to have  been perfectly  willing to\nreap  the benefits of party-plaintiff status.  In one motion that\nhe signed, Jones deemed  himself \"entitled to all the  rights the\nstatutes  and/or  case law  afford  to  any  Party, voluntary  or\ninvoluntary.\"  He cannot, of course, have it both ways.\n\n                                6\n\ndistrict judge  determined that, notwithstanding the  default, he\n\nshould not rely merely on  unverified allegations to determine an\n\nappropriate award of damages in a case not involving a liquidated\n\namount,  see, e.g.,  Dundee Cement Co. v. Howard  Pipe &amp; Concrete\n                                                                 \n\nProds., Inc., 722 F.2d 1319, 1323  (7th Cir. 1983); Byrd v. Keene\n                                                                 \n\nCorp.,  104 F.R.D.  10,  12  (E.D.  Pa.  1984),  and,  therefore,\n     \n\nconvened an evidentiary hearing  to establish the quantum  of the\n\naward.  See Al-Kazemi v. General  Acceptance &amp; Inv. Corp., 633 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp.  540, 542 (D.D.C. 1986);  Systems Indus., Inc.  v. Han, 105\n                                                            \n\nF.R.D. 72, 74-75 (E.D. Pa. 1985).\n\n          Absent a  sum certain, the district  court, in arriving\n\nat the award,  could do no more than rely  on the evidence before\n\nit.  Through no fault of either the court or the counterclaimant,\n\nthe  evidence  produced  at   the  hearing  consisted  mainly  of\n\nLittlefield's   statement  of   damages   and  sworn   testimony.\n\nReviewing this evidence to  the extent possible,5 we  perceive no\n\nabuse  of discretion in a  $2,000 award.   Littlefield stated, by\n\naffidavit, that Catherine Jones's  threats of violence caused him\n\nto  experience fear of physical injury and mental distress.  Non-\n\neconomic  damages  for  apprehension,  emotional   distress,  and\n\npsychic   injury  are   not  easily   computed   and,  therefore,\n\ndeterminations of  this type  are extremely  fact-sensitive. See,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     5Appellants have prosecuted this appeal  without procuring a\ntranscript of the June 3 hearing.  They must, therefore, bear the\nonus  of any uncertainties arising out of an incomplete record on\nappeal.   See Real  v. Hogan,  828 F.2d 58,  60 (1st  Cir. 1987);\n                            \nUnited  States v. One Motor  Yacht Named Mercury,  527 F.2d 1112,\n                                                \n1113-14 (1st Cir. 1975).\n\n                                7\n\ne.g.,  Wagenmann  v.

Bearing in  mind the  incomplete record,  see supra\n                                                                 \n\nnote  5, the nature of the  alleged damages, the modest amount of\n\nthe  award, the  appellants'  failure to  submit any  information\n\nwhatever  at  or  before  the proof-of-claim  hearing,6  and  the\n\ndeferential  standard of  review, we  are powerless  to undo  the\n\naward.     \n\n                  C.

See Roadway  Express, Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nPiper,  447  U.S. 752,  765-66  (1980)  (recognizing \"bad  faith\"\n     \n\nexception to  general rule that federal  courts cannot ordinarily\n\nmake fee-shifting  awards); Stefan  v.

This\n                         \n\npower  should  be  used  sparingly  and  reserved  for  egregious\n\ncircumstances.\n\n                    \n\n     6This eschewal is an appropriate consideration  on appellate\nreview of a damage award.  See, e.g., Knightsbridge Mktg. Servs.,\n                                                                 \nInc.  v. Promociones  Y Proyectos,  728 F.2d  572, 575  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n1984).\n\n                                8\n\n          The district court, citing the \"general non-cooperative\n\nand often  contentious manner\" in which  appellants conducted the\n\nlitigation,  as well  as offering  numerous examples  of untoward\n\npractice,7  determined  that  the  appellants  had surpassed  the\n\nthreshold  of   egregiousness.    The  court   made  a  specific,\n\nmeticulously  detailed finding  of  bad faith  and exercised  its\n\ndiscretion  to  shift the  burden  of Littlefield's  fees  to the\n\nappellants.  We  have scrutinized  the record on  appeal and  are\n\nsatisfied  that, although  the  court's conclusion  of bad  faith\n\nmight not be  inevitable, it is plainly sustainable.  When, as in\n\nthis instance, there are  two plausible views of the  record, the\n\ntrial  court's adoption of one such  view cannot constitute clear\n\nerror.  See United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 706 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1992).  \n\n          Once the court made a supportable finding of bad faith,\n\nit then properly exercised  its discretion and shifted  the fees.\n\nIt  considered the essential factor  (bad faith), did  not add to\n\nthe  mix any improper factors, and made a plausible judgment call\n\nin  weighing  the use  of  its  inherent  powers.

When  confronted\n      \n\nwith a party's defiance of  its management authority, a  district\n\ncourt  is  necessarily  vested with  considerable  discretion  in\n\ndeciding whether to impose  sanctions on that party, and,  if so,\n\n                    \n\n     8In its  fee-shifting order,  the district court  relied, in\nthe alternative, on its power  under state law.  Because  we find\nthat  the court  had inherent  power to  award counsel  fees, see\n                                                                 \nsupra,  we  need  not reach  the  question  of  whether, in  this\n     \ndiversity case, New Hampshire  law also allowed for fee-shifting.\n                                       \nSee Chambers, 111 S. Ct. at 2136-38 (explaining that fee-shifting\n            \nunder  a  federal court's  inherent  power to  redress  bad faith\nconduct  is a  matter  of vindicating  judicial authority,  not a\nmatter of substantive remedy, and is, therefore, permissible in a\ndiversity case whether or not authorized by state law).\n\n     9The rule  authorizes a  district court to  impose sanctions\n\"as are just\" against a party for, inter alia, failure  to obey a\n                                             \nscheduling  or  pretrial order,  or for  failure  to appear  at a\nscheduling  or  pretrial conference.

Lab., Inc., 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir. 1988).\n                            \n\n          The record supports an assessment  that, throughout the\n\ncourse of  this  litigation, appellants  regularly  defied  court\n\norders  directing them  to attend  pretrial hearings,  e.g., both\n                                                           \n\nCatherine and David Jones failed  to appear at hearings scheduled\n\nfor  January  7, 1991,  April  6,  1992, and  June  3, 1992,  and\n\nCatherine  Jones also failed to appear at a hearing scheduled for\n\nJune  24, 1991.   Although appellants  offered excuses  for these\n\nepisodes, they  offered no  irresistibly convincing reasons.   To\n\ngive one illustration, appellants tried to explain their absences\n\non  April 6  and  June 3,  1992,  by claiming  that,  despite all\n\n                                11\n\nindications  to  the contrary,  they  did not  receive  notice of\n\nscheduled hearings.  The  district court disbelieved this excuse.\n\nIt was  entitled to do so.   See, e.g., Spiller, 842  F.2d at 537\n                                               \n\n(noting  plaintiff's \"history  of  foot-dragging\"  and  rejecting\n\nsimilar excuse  in affirming dismissal of  plaintiff's action for\n\nfailure  to  comply  with   court  orders).    To  give   another\n\nillustration, appellants continually  claimed illness (theirs  or\n\nsome  other  family  member's)   but  the  medical  records  they\n\neventually  proffered were  neither timely  filed nor  served, as\n\nrequired, on opposing counsel; moreover, the records were by  and\n\nlarge  too  vague to  satisfy  appellants'  burden.   Given  this\n\ncheckered pattern,  and given,  further, that the  district court\n\nwarned  appellants on  more than  one occasion  about  the likely\n\nconsequences of failure to  attend, we find that the  court acted\n\nwithin its discretion in levying sanctions under Rule 16(f).  See\n                                                                 \n\nGoldman,  Antonetti, Ferraiuoli,  Axtmayer  &amp;  Hertell v.

On  this point,  the  district court,  after  citing\n\n                                12\n\nappellants'  defiance  of two  orders  directing  them to  attend\n\npretrial  hearings  and  noting their  chronicled  propensity  to\n\nengage in  similar behavior  in earlier proceedings,  stated that\n\nthe  sanctions it chose were  fashioned to \"deter plaintiffs, and\n\nother litigants, from engaging in the course of conduct displayed\n\nthroughout  this   litigation.\"10     Deterrence   is  a   widely\n\nrecognized  basis  for  determining  the  amount  of  a  monetary\n\nsanction.  See Media Duplication, 928 F.2d at 1242 (approving use\n                                \n\nof monetary sanctions under Rule 16(f) as a means of deterring an\n\nattorney's neglect of  scheduled proceedings); see also  Navarro-\n                                                                 \n\nAyala,  968 F.2d at 1426-27 (discussing deterrence as a basis for\n     \n\ngauging  monetary sanctions under Rule 11).

CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need go no further.11   In this  case, the district\n\njudge exhibited  commendable patience.   In the end,  however, he\n\nfound that appellants consistently  defied explicit court  orders\n\ndirecting   them  to   attend   pretrial   hearings      hearings\n\n                    \n\n     10In line with the court's goal of deterrence, the sanctions\nare to be paid into the registry of the district court.\n\n     11Appellants waived many other  assignments of error at oral\nargument.   The rest are utterly lacking in merit and need not be\ndiscussed.\n\n                                13\n\nnecessitated, in the main, by their own absences and requests for\n\nreconsideration of earlier rulings.  The judge also found (again,\n\nsupportably)  that appellants pelted the court  with a torrent of\n\nidle   motions  and   submissions,  many   containing  scurrilous\n\nallegations, serving no apparent purpose other than to harass the\n\ncourt,  burden the defendant, and delay a resolution of the case.\n\nGiven  what  the  nisi  prius  roll reveals,  together  with  the\n                             \n\ndistrict court's record-rooted finding that  appellants blatantly\n\ndisregarded the  federal courts'  authority to  manage litigation\n\nthrough  reasonable  means,  there  is no  principled  basis  for\n\nvacating the rulings complained of in this appeal.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                                14\n",

Finding no cognizable error, we\n\naffirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          In  early  1989,  Catherine   M.  Jones  and  her  son,\n\nAlexander  T. Jones, filed suit to recover amounts allegedly owed\n\nby Reid S. Littlefield  in consequence of Littlefield's agreement\n\nto  rent a vacation home in Gilford, New Hampshire.  Littlefield,\n\nthrough  counsel, answered the  complaint and  counterclaimed for\n\nbreach of contract,  assault, and  trespass.1  In  response to  a\n\npretrial  order, the  two  original plaintiffs  filed an  amended\n\ncomplaint  in which they  joined David A. Jones,  an owner of the\n\nproperty  and a signatory to the lease, as a co-plaintiff.2  Soon\n\nthereafter, plaintiffs' attorney moved to withdraw from the case.\n\nOn  January 2,  1990,  the magistrate-judge  allowed the  motion.\n\nFrom  that point forward, David  Jones served as  his own counsel\n\nand at times represented his co-plaintiffs.\n\n                    \n\n     1Appellants' suit  named a myriad  of other defendants.   In\nthe  present  posture of  the case,  no  useful purpose  would be\nserved by furnishing details relevant to these persons and firms.\n\n     2David Jones is Catherine's  husband and Alexander's father.\nHe  is also  an  attorney.    He  represents  the  appellants  in\nconnection with this appeal.   We note in passing  that, although\nAlexander Jones is  listed in  the notice of  appeal, brief,  and\nother documents as  an appellant, he  is seemingly unaffected  by\nany  of the  orders  under review.    We, therefore,  ignore  his\npresence  and treat Catherine and David Jones as if they were the\nsole appellants.\n\n                                2\n\n          In April  1990, appellants withdrew most  of the causes\n\nof  action originally  asserted against  Littlefield.   Buoyed by\n\nthis concession, Littlefield moved to dismiss on the  ground that\n\nthere was no longer a sufficient amount in controversy.  Although\n\nthe  court  denied  Littlefield's  motion  and  gave   appellants\n\npermission  to  supplement their  pleadings,  appellants made  no\n\neffort  to cure the perceived  deficiency.3  On  August 27, 1990,\n\nthe court dismissed their complaint.\n\n          Claiming  that they  had never  received notice  of the\n\nopportunity  to amend  their  pleadings, and  denying (despite  a\n\nclear record to the contrary) that they had withdrawn their other\n\ncauses  of action,  appellants sought  and obtained  the district\n\ncourt's agreement  to reconsider.   The  court withheld entry  of\n\njudgment and set a reconsideration  hearing for January 7,  1991.\n\nThe  appellants did not attend.  Instead, they notified the court\n\na  week  beforehand  that  Catherine  Jones's  medical  condition\n\nprecluded travel from  Pennsylvania to New Hampshire.   The court\n\ncontinued the  hearing until June 24,  1991.  On  that date, only\n\nDavid Jones  appeared, claiming that a  daughter's sudden illness\n\nprevented  his  wife's attendance.    The  court rescheduled  the\n\nhearing  for April  6,  1992, but  warned  appellants that  their\n\nfailure to attend  on the new date  would result in dismissal  of\n\nthe complaint and, possibly, additional sanctions.\n\n                    \n\n     3We use the  term \"perceived deficiency\" advisedly.   As the\ndistrict  court  recognized,  the  amount  in   controversy,  for\npurposes of  federal diversity jurisdiction, is  determined as of\nthe time the case is  first commenced.  See Klepper v.  First Am.\n                                                                 \nBank, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340 (6th Cir. 1990).\n    \n\n                                3\n\n          Notwithstanding  the  court's admonition,  no plaintiff\n\nappeared on  April 6.   Appellants  did not  communicate directly\n\nwith the court but  sent a facsimile transmittal to  their former\n\nattorney  explaining that illness  supposedly prevented them from\n\nattending.  Its patience exhausted,  the district court acted  on\n\nits  earlier dismissal of the complaint and entered judgment.  On\n\nMay   5,  1992,   the   court  denied   appellants'  motion   for\n\nreconsideration  and, at  the  same  time, granted  Littlefield's\n\nmotion for entry  of a  default in respect  to the  counterclaim.\n\nThe court fixed  June 3, 1992 for  a dual-purpose hearing  (i) to\n\ndetermine  damages  on the  counterclaim,  see  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.\n                                              \n\n55(b)(2), (d),  and (ii) to  consider the possible  imposition of\n\nsanctions.  Although appellants  did not show up  for the June  3\n\nhearing, the court received evidence and reserved decision.\n\n          On  September 8,  1992, the  court awarded  Littlefield\n\n$2,000  on  the  counterclaim's   assault  count,  dismissed  the\n\nremaining counts of the counterclaim (finding Littlefield's proof\n\nof  damages inadequate), awarded  Littlefield attorneys'  fees in\n\nthe  amount of  $6,338.80, and  fined Mr.  and Mrs.  Jones $5,000\n\napiece for  their consistent failure to  attend pretrial hearings\n\nand  their bad faith in  conducting the litigation.   This appeal\n\nfollowed.     \n\nII.  DISCUSSION\n\n          Having  studied the  record, we  conclude that  none of\n\nappellants' contentions  merit  relief from  the  various  orders\n\nentered  below.  In explaining why this is so, we comment briefly\n\n                                4\n\non four of appellants' principal points.\n\n                    A.  The Matter of Status.\n                                            \n\n          Throughout most  of  this litigation,  David Jones  has\n\ncharacterized himself as an  \"involuntary plaintiff.\"  On appeal,\n\nhe  maintains this  characterization, arguing  that, as  such, he\n\ncannot be forced to pay sanctions.  We do not  think that Jones's\n\npoint is properly preserved.\n\n          To be  sure, Jones is  an involuntary plaintiff  in the\n\nsense that, on August 28, 1989, the magistrate-judge ordered  the\n\ntwo  original plaintiffs to join him.  (Given his relationship to\n\nthe  property and  the  lease, he  was  a necessary,  perhaps  an\n\nindispensable,  party,  see  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  19.)    However,\n                           \n\nsubsequent to joinder, Jones made several personal appearances in\n\nthe case and also made a number of written submissions.  While he\n\nstyled himself at various times as an \"involuntary plaintiff,\" he\n\nnever asked the district court to drop him as a party.  That ends\n\nthe matter.  In this  circuit, \"it is a party's  first obligation\n\nto  seek any relief that might fairly have been thought available\n\nin the district court before seeking it on appeal.\"   Beaulieu v.\n                                                              \n\nUnited States  Internal Revenue Serv.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517428\"><a href=\"/opinion/517428/janet-a-beaulieu-v-united-states-of-america-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1352 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1989); accord  Dartmouth Rev. v.

Thus, here, neither the question of whether\n\nit  was error for the magistrate-judge to direct that David Jones\n\nbe joined as  a plaintiff,  nor the related  question of  whether\n\n                                5\n\nJones participated in the suit under unfair compulsion, is before\n\nus.4\n\n                  B. The Assessment of Damages.\n                                               \n\n          We next consider Catherine Jones's contention  that the\n\ndistrict court improperly assessed damages against her in the sum\n\nof $2,000.  The  record discloses that, after entering  a default\n\non the  counterclaims, the  district court scheduled  a proof-of-\n\nclaim  hearing for June 3, 1992, directed Littlefield to submit a\n\nfull  accounting   of  his  damages  in   advance,  and  directed\n\nappellants  to respond  to  this submission  before the  hearing.\n\nLittlefield filed a written statement of damages and a supporting\n\nmemorandum.   The appellants filed nothing.   They also boycotted\n\nthe June  3  hearing.   In  contrast,  Littlefield  appeared  and\n\ntestified.  Based upon the evidence before it, the district court\n\nawarded Littlefield $2,000 in  damages against Catherine Jones on\n\nthe assault counterclaim.\n\n          Once the  entry of  a default establishes  the fact  of\n                                                             \n\ndamage, the  trial judge,  sitting without  a jury in  a Rule  55\n\nproceeding, has  considerable latitude in  determining the amount\n                                                                 \n\nof damages.

The\n\n                    \n\n     4Moreover,  Jones seems  to have  been perfectly  willing to\nreap  the benefits of party-plaintiff status.

Through no fault of either the court or the counterclaimant,\n\nthe  evidence  produced  at   the  hearing  consisted  mainly  of\n\nLittlefield's   statement  of   damages   and  sworn   testimony.\n\nReviewing this evidence to  the extent possible,5 we  perceive no\n\nabuse  of discretion in a  $2,000 award.   Littlefield stated, by\n\naffidavit, that Catherine Jones's  threats of violence caused him\n\nto  experience fear of physical injury and mental distress.  Non-\n\neconomic  damages  for  apprehension,  emotional   distress,  and\n\npsychic   injury  are   not  easily   computed   and,  therefore,\n\ndeterminations of  this type  are extremely  fact-sensitive.

We  have scrutinized  the record on  appeal and  are\n\nsatisfied  that, although  the  court's conclusion  of bad  faith\n\nmight not be  inevitable, it is plainly sustainable.

Although appellants  offered excuses  for these\n\nepisodes, they  offered no  irresistibly convincing reasons.   To\n\ngive one illustration, appellants tried to explain their absences\n\non  April 6  and  June 3,  1992,  by claiming  that,  despite all\n\n                                11\n\nindications  to  the contrary,  they  did not  receive  notice of\n\nscheduled hearings.  The  district court disbelieved this excuse.\n\nIt was  entitled to do so.   See, e.g., Spiller, 842  F.2d at 537\n                                               \n\n(noting  plaintiff's \"history  of  foot-dragging\"  and  rejecting\n\nsimilar excuse  in affirming dismissal of  plaintiff's action for\n\nfailure  to  comply  with   court  orders).    To  give   another\n\nillustration, appellants continually  claimed illness (theirs  or\n\nsome  other  family  member's)   but  the  medical  records  they\n\neventually  proffered were  neither timely  filed nor  served, as\n\nrequired, on opposing counsel; moreover, the records were by  and\n\nlarge  too  vague to  satisfy  appellants'  burden.   Given  this\n\ncheckered pattern,  and given,  further, that the  district court\n\nwarned  appellants on  more than  one occasion  about  the likely\n\nconsequences of failure to  attend, we find that the  court acted\n\nwithin its discretion in levying sanctions under Rule 16(f).  See\n                                                                 \n\nGoldman,  Antonetti, Ferraiuoli,  Axtmayer  &amp;  Hertell v.

Square D\n                                                                 \n\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580699\"><a href=\"/opinion/580699/charles-m-thibeault-v-square-d-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  246 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting that  totality of\n   \n\ncircumstances for sanction purposes could include events in other\n\nlitigation).\n\n          We  likewise  conclude  that  the  sanctions   are  not\n\nexcessive.   On  this point,  the  district court,  after  citing\n\n                                12\n\nappellants'  defiance  of two  orders  directing  them to  attend\n\npretrial  hearings  and  noting their  chronicled  propensity  to\n\nengage in  similar behavior  in earlier proceedings,  stated that\n\nthe  sanctions it chose were  fashioned to \"deter plaintiffs, and\n\nother litigants, from engaging in the course of conduct displayed\n\nthroughout  this   litigation.\"10     Deterrence   is  a   widely\n\nrecognized  basis  for  determining  the  amount  of  a  monetary\n\nsanction.  See Media Duplication, 928 F.2d at 1242 (approving use\n                                \n\nof monetary sanctions under Rule 16(f) as a means of deterring an\n\nattorney's neglect of  scheduled proceedings); see also  Navarro-\n                                                                 \n\nAyala,  968 F.2d at 1426-27 (discussing deterrence as a basis for\n     \n\ngauging  monetary sanctions under Rule 11).   Having reviewed the\n\ndistrict court's explanation of why it chose the precise sanction\n\namounts and  finding  that the  amounts are  \"within the  minimum\n\nrange reasonably  required to deter the abusive behavior,\" id. at\n                                                              \n\n1427, we are constrained to conclude that the court below did not\n\noverspill the banks of its discretion under Rule 16(f).\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need go no further.11   In this  case, the district\n\njudge exhibited  commendable patience.   In the end,  however, he\n\nfound that appellants consistently  defied explicit court  orders\n\ndirecting   them  to   attend   pretrial   hearings      hearings\n\n                    \n\n     10In line with the court's goal of deterrence, the sanctions\nare to be paid into the registry of the district court.\n\n     11Appellants waived many other  assignments of error at oral\nargument.   The rest are utterly lacking in merit and need not be\ndiscussed.\n\n                                13\n\nnecessitated, in the main, by their own absences and requests for\n\nreconsideration of earlier rulings.  The judge also found (again,\n\nsupportably)  that appellants pelted the court  with a torrent of\n\nidle   motions  and   submissions,  many   containing  scurrilous\n\nallegations, serving no apparent purpose other than to harass the\n\ncourt,  burden the defendant, and delay a resolution of the case.\n\nGiven  what  the  nisi  prius  roll reveals,  together  with  the\n                             \n\ndistrict court's record-rooted finding that  appellants blatantly\n\ndisregarded the  federal courts'  authority to  manage litigation\n\nthrough  reasonable  means,  there  is no  principled  basis  for\n\nvacating the rulings complained of in this appeal.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                                14\n</pre>",
