She  argues that  we should  reverse her  conviction\n\nbecause:   (1)  the  prosecutor violated  Fed.  R. Crim.  P.\n\n16(a)(1)(A)  by  failing   to  timely   disclose  a   postal\n\ninspector's report summarizing statements Burns made  to one\n\nof  her  supervisors;  (2)  the  District  Judge erroneously\n\nadmitted other allegedly  involuntary statements Burns  made\n\nto  the   investigating  postal  inspector;  (3)  the  Judge\n\nmistakenly  read from  a  superseded  indictment during  his\n\npreliminary  jury  instructions;  (4)  the Judge  improperly\n\nexcluded on hearsay grounds certain  testimony Burns offered\n\nto impeach  the testimony of  another witness;  and (5)  the\n\nJudge's  jury  instruction  concerning  Burns'  intoxication\n\ndefense  unconstitutionally required  her to prove  that she\n\nacted  without criminal intent.  Finding no reversible error\n\nin these claims, we affirm her conviction.    \n\n                       I.  Background\n                                     \n\n               Lisa Burns  first  came to  the attention  of\n\nUnited  States  Postal  Inspectors  after  Inspector  Robert\n\nBethel placed a routine \"test mailing\" at the  Naples, Maine\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\npost office  where  Burns worked.    \"Test mailing\"  is  the\n\nPostal  Service's method of determining whether employees at\n\ncertain randomly-selected post offices are properly handling\n\nthe mail.   The \"test  mail\" is an  envelope addressed  to a\n\nfictitious  person at a non-existent post  office box at the\n\ntargeted  post office.   The  envelope  is typically  marked\n\n\"refund inside\"  and  contains a  rebate check  made out  to\n\nbearer.  The return address on the envelope specifies a post\n\noffice box in the New  England area controlled by the Postal\n\nService.  If the mailing  is handled properly, it is usually\n\nmarked \"undeliverable\" and returned within two weeks.  If it\n\nis  not  returned,  the postal  inspector  targets  the post\n\noffice  for  additional   test  mailings  and  attempts   to\n\ndetermine what happened to the initial mailing.   \n\n               The first  test mailing Bethel  placed at the\n\nNaples post  office contained a  $5 rebate check.   When the\n\nmailing was not returned, Bethel recovered the cashed rebate\n\ncheck and determined  that it  had been  endorsed by  Burns.\n\nBethel then  tried  to tempt  Burns  with a  second  mailing\n\ncontaining a $10  rebate check.  It also  disappeared.  This\n\ntime, Bethel discovered that the rebate check apparently had\n\nbeen endorsed by Karen King, Burns' roommate. \n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n               After  failing  to   entice  Burns  with  yet\n\nanother test mailing,  Bethel confronted her in  the parking\n\nlot of the  post office.   He identified himself,  described\n\nthe nature of his investigation,  advised Burns that she was\n\nnot under arrest, and asked her whether she would be willing\n\nto speak  with him.   She agreed,  and they returned  to the\n\npost  office.  Before beginning his questioning, Bethel read\n\nBurns her  Miranda rights from a Postal Service waiver form.\n                  \n\nHe also had her initial  each printed statement after it was\n\nread and sign the form at the end.  Burns then  made several\n\nincriminating statements in response to Bethel's  questions.\n\nAt  the end of  the interview,  she wrote  out and  signed a\n\nstatement memorializing her  admissions.   Burns later  sent\n\nBethel  a supplemental statement  in which she  alleged that\n\nshe  had an  imperfect  recollection  of  the  incidents  in\n\nquestion  because she was  an alcoholic and  was intoxicated\n\nwhen she took the test mailings.                At    trial,\n\nthe government's case rested primarily on Bethel's testimony\n\nand  Burns'   admissions.     In  response,   Burns  pleaded\n\nentrapment and intoxication.   The jury ultimately  rejected\n\nher defenses and found Burns guilty on both counts.  She was\n\nlater sentenced to 60 days confinement and fined $500.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n                      II.  Discussion\n                                     \n\nA.        Pre-Trial Disclosure Pursuant to Rule 16\n                                                  \n\n               Burns' primary argument on appeal is that the\n\nprosecutor violated Rule 16(a)(1)(A)  by failing to disclose\n\nprior to trial a report summarizing statements Burns made to\n\none  of  her supervisors.    In  pertinent  part,  the  rule\n\nprovides that: \n\n               Upon  request  of  a defendant\n               the government  shall disclose\n               to  the  defendant   and  make\n               available    for   inspection,\n               copying, or photographing: . .\n               . that portion  of any written\n               record      containing     the\n               substance of any relevant oral\n               statement    made    by    the\n               defendant  whether  before  or\n               after  arrest  in  response to\n               interrogation  by  any  person\n               then known to the defendant to\n               be a government agent  . . . .\n\nBurns  argues that her  supervisor was a  \"government agent\"\n\nand  that   she  made   her  statements   \"in  response   to\n\ninterrogation.\"   Thus, she contends that the prosecutor was\n\nobligated  to disclose the  report pursuant to  her pretrial\n\nrequest.   We reject  Burns' arguments because  we determine\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nthat  Burns' supervisor was not a \"government agent\" as that\n\nterm is used in Rule 16.1\n\n               Rule 16 does  not define \"government  agent.\"\n\nWe  therefore   must  choose   between  the   two  plausible\n\ndefinitions  of  the   term.    Viewed  broadly,   the  term\n\nencompasses anyone who performs duties of a public nature on\n\nbehalf of the executive, legislative or judicial branches of\n\nthe  local,  state  or  federal  government.    Black's  Law\n                                                            \n\nDictionary  695-96 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \"government\" and\n          \n\n\"government agent\").   Burns' supervisor would qualify  as a\n\ngovernment  agent  under  this  definition  because  he  was\n\n                    \n\n1         We also  reject Burns' additional  assertion that,\nbecause  Bethel  reduced the  supervisor's  oral  summary of\ndefendant's  statements  to  writing,  this written  summary\nconstitutes a recorded statement of the defendant subject to\ndisclosure \"regardless of  who the statement was made  to or\nhow it was occasioned.\"   Although the first subpart of Rule\n16(a)(1)(A)  makes   a  defendant's  \"written   or  recorded\nstatements\" discoverable  irrespective of whether  they were\nmade  in response  to interrogation  by  a known  government\nagent,  we agree  with the  Second Circuit Court  of Appeals\nthat an oral statement does not become \"written or recorded\"\nmerely because a government agent made  a written summary of\nthe statement before  trial.  In Re United  States, 834 F.2d\n                                                  \n283, 284-85 (2d  Cir. 1987).  See also,  e.g., United States\n                                                            \nv. McCure, 734  F.2d 484, 492-93 (10th Cir. 1984).   This is\n         \nespecially true where,  as here, the statement  was actually\nheard by a  third party and then reported  to the government\nagent at a later date.  See In Re United States, 834 F.2d at\n                                               \n285-86.\n               Finally,  because  we  agree with  the  trial\njudge that Burns' supervisor was not  a government agent, we\nneed  not decide  whether Burns'  statements  were made  \"in\nresponse to interrogation.\"  \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nemployed  by the  United  States  Postal  Service  when  the\n\nstatements  were made.  The competing definition is narrower\n\nand more colloquial.  It includes only persons with criminal\n\nlaw  enforcement responsibilities  or  their  agents.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g.,  Hoffa v.  United  States, 385  U.S. 293,  295, 305-07\n                               \n\n(1966) (using \"government  agent\" to describe an  undercover\n\nlaw enforcement officer); Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292,\n                                             \n\n294,  297,  299  (1990).    Under  this  definition,  Burns'\n\nsupervisor would not qualify as a  government agent since he\n\nhad no criminal law enforcement responsibilities and was not\n\nacting as an agent of  the postal inspectors when Burns made\n\nthe  incriminating statements.  The choice between these two\n\ndefinitions presents  a question of  law which we  review de\n                                                            \n\nnovo.  United States v.

Dec. 15, 1993).\n\n               We begin  our analysis  with  the axiom  that\n\nlanguage must be interpreted in context.  Kelly v. Robinson,\n                                                           \n\n479 U.S. 36,  43 (1986).  As we  have recently acknowledged,\n\n\"[t]erms  in an act  whose meaning may  appear plain outside\n\nthe scheme  of the statute  can take on a  different meaning\n\nwhen read in their proper  context.\"  Greenwood Trust Co. v.\n                                                            \n\nMassachusetts,  971 F.2d  818, 825  (1st  Cir. 1992),  cert.\n                                                            \n\ndenied, 113 S. Ct. 974 (1993).  \n      \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n               Here,   by    limiting   the    prosecution's\n\ndisclosure obligation  to summaries  of relevant  statements\n\nthat are made by a defendant \"in response to interrogation,\"\n\nthe  Rule's surrounding  text strongly  supports the  narrow\n\nreading of the  term.  When Rule  16 was amended in  1974 to\n\ninclude the language at issue, the amendment's drafters were\n\nworking in  a milieu in  which courts were required  to give\n\nspecial  attention to  statements  obtained in  response  to\n\ninterrogation by  law  enforcement  officers.    See,  e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).  Obviously, Miranda\n                                                            \n\nand  its  progeny  require   suppression  of  a  defendant's\n\nstatements obtained  through custodial  interrogation unless\n\nthe defendant  properly waived  his or  her Miranda  rights.\n                                                   \n\nId. at  444-45.  Moreover,  even if  a defendant was  not in\n  \n\ncustody, his or  her statements might still be suppressed if\n\nthey were coerced  through interrogation by  law enforcement\n\nofficers.  See, e.g., Rogers  v. Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, 544\n                                         \n\n(1961);  Davis v.

See, e.g., Yates v. United States, 384 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n586, 587-88 (5th Cir. 1967) (hotel manager who  tipped FBI);\n\nUnited  States v.

Thus, if \"government agent\"  refers only\n\nto  law enforcement  officials or  persons  acting on  their\n\nbehalf, the potential for pretrial suppression of statements\n\nthat  resulted   from  interrogation  by   such  individuals\n\nprovides  a rational  basis  for limiting  the  government's\n\npretrial  disclosure obligation  to summaries  of statements\n\nmade \"in response to interrogation.\"  The rational basis for\n\nthe   interrogation  limitation   disappears,  however,   if\n\n\"government agent\" is construed to mean government employee.\n\n               Besides enjoying  strong contextual  support,\n\nthe  narrow   meaning  of  \"government   agent\"  avoids  the\n\narbitrariness that  would result  if the  term were  defined\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nmore  expansively.   We  agree  that  the  broad reading  of\n\n\"government agent\" gives  maximum deference to  the policies\n\nunderlying Rule 16's mandatory disclosure rules.  See United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v.

Once it is  divorced from the\n\nlaw  enforcement  context,   however,  this  definition   is\n\nproblematic  because  it   deteriorates  into  a  completely\n\narbitrary limitation on the prosecution's duty  to disclose.\n\nUnder the term's broad reading, for example, the prosecution\n\nwould   be  obligated  to  disclose  portions  of  a  report\n\nsummarizing statements  the defendant  made to a  government\n\ncook,  but  not  those  portions  of the  same  report  that\n\nsummarize statements the defendant made to another cook at a\n\nprivately-run  diner.  Moreover, given that Rule 16 requires\n\nthat the individual to whom the statements are made be \"then\n\nknown  to  the   defendant\"  as  a  government   agent,  the\n\nprosecution  would  only   be  obligated  to   disclose  the\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ndefendant's  statements  to  the  government  cook  if   the\n\ndefendant knew  when she made  the statements that  the cook\n\nwas  a government  employee.    The  arbitrariness  of  such\n\ndistinctions is obvious.  \n\n               Consistent with the rule of construction that\n\nlegislative  enactments  \"should  be  interpreted  to  avoid\n\nuntenable  distinctions  and unreasonable  results  whenever\n\npossible,\"   American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63,\n                                              \n\n71 (1982);  Kelly v.

Here,\n\nthe  narrower  definition of  \"government agent\"  limits the\n\ngovernment's pretrial disclosure obligation to summaries  of\n\nthose statements that  are most likely to require a pretrial\n\nruling before they are admitted into evidence.  By doing so,\n\nthis  definition serves  the  policies  underlying  Rule  16\n\nwithout irrationally  requiring the prosecution to  base its\n\ndisclosure determination on whether the defendant knows that\n\nthe  person  to whom  she  is  making  her statements  is  a\n\ngovernment  employee.   We therefore  agree  with the  trial\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\ncourt  that, as used  in Rule 16,  \"government agent\" refers\n\nonlyto lawenforcement agentsorpersons actingon theirbehalf.2\n\nB.        Voluntariness of Burns' Confession\n                                            \n\n               Burns  next challenges  the District  Judge's\n\ndenial of  her  motion  to suppress  the  oral  and  written\n\nstatements  she made in response to questioning by Inspector\n\nBethel.  She alleges that  Bethel promised not to arrest her\n\nif she cooperated with  his investigation.  She  also claims\n\nthat Bethel's questioning was inherently coercive because it\n\noccurred  at the  one-room post  office in  the presence  of\n\ncustomers  and her supervisor.   Finally, she  contends that\n\nshe  was  in  a \"weakened  psychological  state\"  during the\n\ninterview  because  she  was an  alcoholic  who  had stopped\n\ndrinking only two weeks earlier.  Based upon the totality of\n\nthese   factors,  Burns  claims  that  her  statements  were\n\ninvoluntary and therefore should have been suppressed.  \n\n               In   determining  the   voluntariness  of   a\n\nconfession,  courts   must  apply   the  \"totality   of  the\n\n                    \n\n2         In reaching this conclusion, we do not endorse the\nprosecution's  decision to withhold Bethel's report.

Although the ultimate issue of voluntariness is\n\na question of law subject  to plenary review, we will accept\n\nthe district court's subsidiary findings of fact unless they\n\nare \"clearly erroneous.\"  United States v. Garcia,  983 F.2d\n                                                 \n\n1160, 1167  (1st Cir.  1993).  Further,  we will  uphold the\n\ndistrict court's  denial of  a motion to  suppress if  it is\n\nsupported by any reasonable view of the evidence.  Id.   \n                                                      \n\n               Applying these standards to the three factors\n\nallegedly  requiring  suppression  of Burns'  statements  --\n\nBethel's alleged promise, his  choice of interrogation site,\n\nand  Burns' mental  state -- we  conclude that  the District\n\nJudge correctly denied her motion to suppress.  First, while\n\nBurns testified  that Bethel promised  not to arrest  her if\n\nshe  agreed  to  be interviewed,  the  Magistrate  Judge who\n\npresided  at  the   suppression  hearing  accepted  Bethel's\n\ncontrary testimony and  found that he had never  made such a\n\npromise.  Since  the record contains sufficient  evidence to\n\nsupport the Magistrate Judge's finding, the District Judge's\n\nacceptance of this  finding was not clearly  erroneous.  See\n                                                            \n\nUnited States v. Cruz Jimenez, 894 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1990)\n                             \n\n(\"Where  there  are  two  competing  interpretations  of the\n\nevidence, the district court's choice of one of  them cannot\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nbe  clearly  erroneous.\").   Accordingly,  Bethel's  alleged\n\npromise  not  to  prosecute  Burns  plays  no  role  in  our\n\nevaluation of whether her statements were voluntary.  \n\n               Second,  we reject  Burns' claim  that Bethel\n\nchose an inherently coercive setting for the interview.  The\n\nrecord amply supports the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that\n\nBurns agreed  to  be interviewed  at the  post office  after\n\nbeing  informed that  she  was not  under  arrest and  after\n\nvoluntarily waiving  her Miranda  rights.   Moreover,  Burns\n                                \n\nworked  at the post  office, and so  was intimately familiar\n\nwith the  site Bethel  chose for  the interview.  Given that\n\nBurns  agreed to  be  interviewed  in familiar  surroundings\n\nafter  being advised  that she  was under  no obligation  to\n\nspeak, we cannot accept her claim that Bethel's  decision to\n\nconduct  the interview  at the  post  office was  inherently\n\ncoercive.\n\n               Finally, Burns  contends that  her statements\n\nwere involuntary because they were a product of her weakened\n\nmental state.   Burns correctly conceded at  the suppression\n\nhearing  that,  absent  some  evidence  of  coercive  police\n\nconduct, the  court could not find that  her weakened mental\n\nstate  rendered her statements involuntary.  See Colorado v.\n                                                            \n\nConnelly,  479 U.S.  157, 163-67  (1986);  United States  v.\n                                                            \n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nVictoria-Peguero, 920  F.2d 77,  88 (1st  Cir. 1990),  cert.\n                                                            \n\ndenied,  111 S.  Ct. 2053  (1991).   Since  we have  already\n      \n\nrejected  Burns'  contention   that  Bethel's  conduct   was\n\ncoercive, we must reject her state of mind argument as well.\n\nC.        Reading from the Wrong Indictment\n                                           \n\n               Burns   claims   that  the   District   Judge\n\ncommitted  reversible  error by  mistakenly  reading from  a\n\nsuperseded indictment when he described the charged offenses\n\nin his preliminary jury instructions.  Because Burns did not\n\nobject  to  the  Judge's preliminary  instructions,  we  are\n\nlimited  to \"plain  error\" review.    See Fed.  R. Crim.  P.\n                                         \n\n52(b).   Accordingly,  we will  not  reverse her  conviction\n\nunless:   (1) the Judge erred;  (2) his error was \"clear\" or\n\n\"obvious\";  and (3)  the error affected  Burns' \"substantial\n\nrights,\"  which in  this case  means that the  claimed error\n\nprobably affected the jury's verdict.   See United States v.\n                                                            \n\nOlano, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 1777-78 (1993).  Here, because Burns\n     \n\nhas  failed to  show  that the  court's  error affected  her\n\nsubstantial rights, her claim fails.   \n\n               Although the  District Judge  mistakenly read\n\nfrom  the   original  indictment   during  his   preliminary\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\ninstructions,  this error could not have affected the jury's\n\nverdicts.   First,  each of  the  original indictment's  two\n\ncounts  tracked the language of the embezzlement statute and\n\ndescribed  each embezzlement's  approximate date  and place.\n\nSecond, the only  difference between the two  indictments is\n\nthat the original  indictment identified the embezzled  test\n\nmailings  solely  by  listing  their  fictitious  addresses,\n\nwhereas  the  superseding  indictment  also  identified  the\n\npayors  and  check numbers  of  the rebate  checks  that the\n\nmailings contained.   Since the original indictment provided\n\nBurns  with enough information about the charged offenses to\n\nboth  prepare for  trial  and  avoid  double  jeopardy,  the\n\nadditional   information   contained  in   the   superseding\n\nindictment is mere surplusage.  See United States v. Serino,\n                                                           \n\n835 F.2d  924, 929 (1st  Cir. 1987).  Moreover,  the Judge's\n\nfailure to read  this surplusage to the jury  could not have\n\naffected  its verdicts because the contents of the embezzled\n\ntest mailings  were not  in dispute.   See United  States v.\n                                                            \n\nYefsky, 994  F.2d 885,  892-94 (1st Cir.  1993) (trying  the\n      \n\ndefendant on  an indictment  containing insufficient  detail\n\nconcerning the  charged  offense was  harmless  error  where\n\ndefendant received advance notice of the government's  trial\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\ntheory  and defendant had an adequate opportunity to respond\n\nat trial).3\n\nD.        Hearsay\n                 \n\n               Burns next  contends that the  District Judge\n\nimproperly excluded as hearsay certain testimony she offered\n\nto impeach the  testimony of another witness.   Early in her\n\ncase, Burns called  her co-worker and friend,  Cathy Larsen,\n\nas a character witness.  On cross-examination, Larsen stated\n\nthat she had  visited Burns after Bethel had  confronted her\n\nabout the  missing mailings.   Larsen  then testified  that,\n\nwhile discussing the theft of  the test mail, Burns told her\n\nthat she \"had  done something stupid,\" was  \"embarrassed and\n\nashamed\"  and apologized  for her  conduct.   After  calling\n\nseveral other  witnesses, Burns called  her roommate,  Karen\n\nKing.  King, who had been present with Burns during Larsen's\n\nvisit, testified: \n\n                    \n\n3         Burns also argues that she was tried on  the wrong\nindictment.   However, this argument does not merit extended\ndiscussion because  it is not  supported by the record.   At\nthe  close of  the  case, the  judge  instructed counsel  to\nreview both the indictment and the jury  verdict form before\nthey were submitted to  the jury.   The record is devoid  of\nany suggestion that counsel failed to ensure that it was the\nsuperseding indictment that was submitted.   We thus have no\nreason  to determine whether Burns' conviction would have to\nbe  reversed  if the  jury  had  been  asked to  render  its\nverdicts on the original indictment.    \n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\n          Q.   On  that night  did  Lisa make  any\n          statement      saying   she   had  taken\n          checks?\n\n          A.   Never.\n\nThe  prosecutor  objected  to King's  answer,  claiming  that the\n\nanswer was  hearsay.    Defense  counsel responded  that  he  was\n\noffering  the testimony  not to  establish that  Burns  had never\n\ntaken  the checks, but  to impeach Larsen's  testimony that Burns\n\nhad made  the statements.   The Judge sustained  the prosecutor's\n\nobjection.    On appeal,  Burns contends  that exclusion  of this\n\ntestimony was reversible error.  \n\n               We agree that King should  have been allowed  to\n\ntestify that Burns never admitted to taking the checks.  When the\n\nprosecutor   elicited   testimony   from  Larsen   about   Burns'\n\nstatements,  the  prosecutor  put  those  statements in  dispute.\n\nBurns then was entitled to  produce testimony from another of the\n\nmeeting's participants to refute the prosecutor's version of what\n\nwas  said.   Such testimony  is not  hearsay because  it was  not\n\noffered to  prove the  truth of  Burns' out-of-court  statements.\n\nSince  King   was  prepared   to  testify   concerning  her   own\n\nobservations of what  was said during the  meeting, her testimony\n\nshould have been admitted.                         Although    the\n\ntrial judge  erred, we  decline to  reverse Burns'  conviction on\n\nthis basis because  his error was harmless.  See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n                                             \n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\n52(a).  Burns  did not challenge the  prosecutor's well-supported\n\nclaim   that  she   took  the   test  mailings.     Under   these\n\ncircumstances, her statements to Larsen were harmful only to  the\n\nextent  that they  might  undermine  her claim  that  she was  so\n\nintoxicated when  she took the  checks that she did  not remember\n\ndoing so.  Even for this  purpose, however, the statements are of\n\nlimited probative  value.   Burns allegedly  made the  statements\n\nafter  she was  confronted by  Bethel and  accused of  taking the\n\nmailings.  Having been  so accused, and thus  supposedly learning\n\nwhat  she  had   done,  it  was  entirely  consistent   with  her\n\nintoxication  defense for  her  to have  expressed  shame to  her\n\nfriends.  Given the limited value of Larsen's testimony, the fact\n\nthat Burns was  denied the opportunity to challenge  it could not\n\nhave affected the jury's verdict.  \n\n               The   harmlessness  of   the  Judge's  error  is\n\nunderscored by another fact --  that the prosecution did not need\n\nto rely on Larsen's testimony  to establish that Burns acted with\n\ncriminal intent.  In her statements to Bethel, Burns acknowledged\n\ntaking the test  mailings and described how she did so in detail.\n\nIt was  this testimony, far  more than Larsen's,  that demolished\n\nBurns' claim that she was  too intoxicated to remember taking the\n\ntest mailings.  Accordingly, it  was harmless error for the Judge\n\nto  exclude King's  testimony about  her  recollection of  Burns'\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nstatements to  Larsen.   See, e.g., United  States v.  Burke, 948\n                                                         \n\nF.2d 23, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1991).   \n\nE.           The Intoxication Instruction\n                                      \n\n               Burns' final claim is that the District  Judge's\n\nintoxication instruction unconstitutionally required her to prove\n\nthat  she acted  without criminal  intent.   The  Judge gave  the\n\nfollowing instruction on Burns' intoxication defense:    \n\n          Now, the defendant  claims that she  was\n                                                  \n\n          so far  overcome by  the use of  alcohol\n                                                  \n          that it was impossible  on the occasions\n                                                  \n          for her  to form  the required  specific\n                                                  \n          intent,  as  I  have just  defined  that\n                \n          intent to you.  \n\n          I  instruct you  that  you may  consider\n          evidence   of   alcohol   use   by   the\n          defendant, along  with all of  the other\n          evidence,   in   deciding   whether  the\n          government   has    proven   beyond    a\n          reasonable doubt that  the defendant had\n          the  requisite  intent  to,  as  I  have\n          described that to you. (Emphasis added).\n\nBurns  contends that  the  phrase \"defendant  claims  ... it  was\n\nimpossible\"  suggested that Burns was required  to prove that she\n\nacted without criminal intent.  We disagree.  \n\n               The  intoxication  instruction merely  described\n\nthe degree  to which  Burns' cognitive  capacity  must have  been\n\nimpaired before  her alcohol use  could support a finding  of not\n\nguilty.  Immediately after instructing the jury on the issue, the\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nJudge reminded the  jury that the prosecution still  had to prove\n\nthat Burns acted with criminal intent.  When the two instructions\n\nare  read together,  they adequately apprised  the jury  that the\n\nprosecution  had the burden  of establishing beyond  a reasonable\n\ndoubt   that  Burns'  alcohol  use  did   not  prevent  her  from\n\nintentionally committing the  charged offenses.  Accordingly,  we\n\nreject Burns' challenge to the Judge's intoxication instruction.4\n\n               For the foregoing  reasons, Burns' conviction is\n\nAffirmed.\n      \n\n                    \n\n4         The prosecution contends  that Burns had  no right\nto  an  intoxication instruction  because intoxication  is a\ndiminished capacity defense barred  by the Insanity  Defense\nReform Act of  1984, 18 U.S.C.    17.

She argues that we should reverse her conviction because:  (1) the prosecutor violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A) by failing to timely disclose a postal inspector's report summarizing statements Burns made to one of her supervisors;  (2) the District Judge erroneously admitted other allegedly involuntary statements Burns made to the investigating postal inspector;  (3) the Judge mistakenly read from a superseded indictment during his preliminary jury instructions;  (4) the Judge improperly excluded on hearsay grounds certain testimony Burns offered to impeach the testimony of another witness;  and (5) the Judge's jury instruction concerning Burns' intoxication defense unconstitutionally required her to prove that she acted without criminal intent.  Finding no reversible error in these claims, we affirm her conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lisa Burns first came to the attention of United States Postal Inspectors after Inspector Robert Bethel placed a routine \"test mailing\" at the Naples, Maine post office where Burns worked.  \"Test mailing\" is the Postal Service's method of determining whether employees at certain randomly-selected post offices are properly handling the mail.  The \"test mail\" is an envelope addressed to a fictitious person at a non-existent post office box at the targeted post office.  The envelope is typically marked \"refund inside\" and contains a rebate check made out to bearer.  The return address on the envelope specifies a post office box in the New England area controlled by the Postal Service.  If the mailing is handled properly, it is usually marked \"undeliverable\" and returned within two weeks.  If it is not returned, the postal inspector targets the post office for additional test mailings and attempts to determine what happened to the initial mailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first test mailing Bethel placed at the Naples post office contained a $5 rebate check.  When the mailing was not returned, Bethel recovered the cashed rebate check and determined that it had been endorsed by Burns.  Bethel then tried to tempt Burns with a second mailing containing a $10 rebate check.  It also disappeared.  This time, Bethel discovered that the rebate check apparently had been endorsed by Karen King, Burns' roommate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After failing to entice Burns with yet another test mailing, Bethel confronted her in the parking lot of the post office.  He identified himself, described the nature of his investigation, advised Burns that she was not under arrest, and asked her whether she would be willing to speak with him.  She agreed, and they returned to the post office.  Before beginning his questioning, Bethel read Burns her Miranda rights from a Postal Service waiver form.  He also had her initial each printed statement after it was read and sign the form at the end.  Burns then made several incriminating statements in response to Bethel's questions.  At the end of the interview, she wrote out and signed a statement memorializing her admissions.  Burns later sent Bethel a supplemental statement in which she alleged that she had an imperfect recollection of the incidents in question because she was an alcoholic and was intoxicated when she took the test mailings.  At trial, the government's case rested primarily on Bethel's testimony and Burns' admissions.  In response, Burns pleaded entrapment and intoxication.  The jury ultimately rejected her defenses and found Burns guilty on both counts.  She was later sentenced to 60 days confinement and fined $500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p>A. Pre-Trial Disclosure Pursuant to Rule 16</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns' primary argument on appeal is that the prosecutor violated Rule 16(a)(1)(A) by failing to disclose prior to trial a report summarizing statements Burns made to one of her supervisors.  In pertinent part, the rule provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Upon request of a defendant the government shall disclose to the defendant and make available for inspection, copying, or photographing:  ... that portion of any written record containing the substance of any relevant oral statement made by the defendant whether before or after arrest in response to interrogation by any person then known to the defendant to be a government agent....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns argues that her supervisor was a \"government agent\" and that she made her statements \"in response to interrogation.\"   Thus, she contends that the prosecutor was obligated to disclose the report pursuant to her pretrial request.  We reject Burns' arguments because we determine that Burns' supervisor was not a \"government agent\" as that term is used in Rule 16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 16 does not define \"government agent.\"   We therefore must choose between the two plausible definitions of the term.  Viewed broadly, the term encompasses anyone who performs duties of a public nature on behalf of the executive, legislative or judicial branches of the local, state or federal government.  Black's Law Dictionary 695-96 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \"government\" and \"government agent\").  Burns' supervisor would qualify as a government agent under this definition because he was employed by the United States Postal Service when the statements were made.  The competing definition is narrower and more colloquial.  It includes only persons with criminal law enforcement responsibilities or their agents.  See, e.g., Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 295, 305-07, 87 S.Ct. 408, 410, 415-16, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966) (using \"government agent\" to describe an undercover law enforcement officer);  Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292, 294, 297, 299, 110 S.Ct. 2394, 2395, 2397, 2398, 110 L.Ed.2d 243 (1990).  Under this definition, Burns' supervisor would not qualify as a government agent since he had no criminal law enforcement responsibilities and was not acting as an agent of the postal inspectors when Burns made the incriminating statements.  The choice between these two definitions presents a question of law which we review de novo.  United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 294 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with the axiom that language must be interpreted in context.  Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 43, 107 S.Ct. 353, 357, 93 L.Ed.2d 216 (1986).  As we have recently acknowledged, \"[t]erms in an act whose meaning may appear plain outside the scheme of the statute can take on a different meaning when read in their proper context.\"  Greenwood Trust Co. v. Massachusetts, 971 F.2d 818, 825 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 974, 122 L.Ed.2d 129 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, by limiting the prosecution's disclosure obligation to summaries of relevant statements that are made by a defendant \"in response to interrogation,\" the Rule's surrounding text strongly supports the narrow reading of the term.  When Rule 16 was amended in 1974 to include the language at issue, the amendment's drafters were working in a milieu in which courts were required to give special attention to statements obtained in response to interrogation by law enforcement officers.  See, e.g., Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).  Obviously, Miranda and its progeny require suppression of a defendant's statements obtained through custodial interrogation unless the defendant properly waived his or her Miranda rights.  Id. at 444-45, 86 S.Ct. at 1612-13.   Moreover, even if a defendant was not in custody, his or her statements might still be suppressed if they were coerced through interrogation by law enforcement officers.  See, e.g., Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, 544, 81 S.Ct. 735, 741, 5 L.Ed.2d 760 (1961);  Davis v. North Carolina, 384 U.S. 737, 740-42, 86 S.Ct. 1761, 1763-65, 16 L.Ed.2d 895 (1966);  Beecher v. Alabama, 389 U.S. 35, 36 &amp; n. 2, 88 S.Ct. 189, 191 &amp; n. 2, 19 L.Ed.2d 35 (1967).  See also Beckwith v. United States, 425 U.S. 341, 347-48, 96 S.Ct. 1612, 1616-17, 48 L.Ed.2d 1 (1976) (citing Rogers and Davis for the proposition that statements resulting from noncustodial interrogation may be suppressed if involuntary).  Such concerns did not then and do not now apply to statements obtained from a defendant by persons without law enforcement responsibilities, regardless of whether the statements were obtained through interrogation.  See, e.g., Yates v. United States, 384 F.2d 586, 587-88 (5th Cir.1967) (hotel manager who tipped FBI);  United States v. Antonelli, 434 F.2d 335, 336-38 (2d Cir.1970) (private security guard);  United States v. Eide, 875 F.2d 1429, 1431, 1433-34 (9th Cir.1989) (defendant's supervisor at federal Veterans' Administration Medical Center);  United States v. Pullen, 721 F.2d 788, 790-91 (11th Cir.1983) (bank officials).  Thus, if \"government agent\" refers only to law enforcement officials or persons acting on their behalf, the potential for pretrial suppression of statements that resulted from interrogation by such individuals provides a rational basis for limiting the government's pretrial disclosure obligation to summaries of statements made \"in response to interrogation.\"   The rational basis for the interrogation limitation disappears, however, if \"government agent\" is construed to mean government employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides enjoying strong contextual support, the narrow meaning of \"government agent\" avoids the arbitrariness that would result if the term were defined more expansively.  We agree that the broad reading of \"government agent\" gives maximum deference to the policies underlying Rule 16's mandatory disclosure rules.  See United States v. Alvarez, 987 F.2d 77, 84-85 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 147, 126 L.Ed.2d 109 (1993) (Rule 16's mandatory disclosure provisions promote \"the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice by providing the defendant with sufficient information upon which to base an intelligent [ ] plea;  by minimizing the undesirable effect of suppression at trial;  and by contributing to the accuracy of the fact finding process.\").  Once it is divorced from the law enforcement context, however, this definition is problematic because it deteriorates into a completely arbitrary limitation on the prosecution's duty to disclose.  Under the term's broad reading, for example, the prosecution would be obligated to disclose portions of a report summarizing statements the defendant made to a government cook, but not those portions of the same report that summarize statements the defendant made to another cook at a privately-run diner.  Moreover, given that Rule 16 requires that the individual to whom the statements are made be \"then known to the defendant\" as a government agent, the prosecution would only be obligated to disclose the defendant's statements to the government cook if the defendant knew when she made the statements that the cook was a government employee.  The arbitrariness of such distinctions is obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with the rule of construction that legislative enactments \"should be interpreted to avoid untenable distinctions and unreasonable results whenever possible,\" American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 71, 102 S.Ct. 1534, 1538, 71 L.Ed.2d 748 (1982);  Kelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 361 (1st Cir.1991), we refuse to construe \"government agent\" in a way that requires such arbitrary line drawing when a less problematic reading of the term is also plausible.  Here, the narrower definition of \"government agent\" limits the government's pretrial disclosure obligation to summaries of those statements that are most likely to require a pretrial ruling before they are admitted into evidence.  By doing so, this definition serves the policies underlying Rule 16 without irrationally requiring the prosecution to base its disclosure determination on whether the defendant knows that the person to whom she is making her statements is a government employee.  We therefore agree with the trial court that, as used in Rule 16, \"government agent\" refers only to law enforcement agents or persons acting on their behalf.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>B. Voluntariness of Burns' Confession</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns next challenges the District Judge's denial of her motion to suppress the oral and written statements she made in response to questioning by Inspector Bethel.  She alleges that Bethel promised not to arrest her if she cooperated with his investigation.  She also claims that Bethel's questioning was inherently coercive because it occurred at the one-room post office in the presence of customers and her supervisor.  Finally, she contends that she was in a \"weakened psychological state\" during the interview because she was an alcoholic who had stopped drinking only two weeks earlier.  Based upon the totality of these factors, Burns claims that her statements were involuntary and therefore should have been suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the voluntariness of a confession, courts must apply the \"totality of the circumstances test.\"  Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 286, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1251, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991).  Although the ultimate issue of voluntariness is a question of law subject to plenary review, we will accept the district court's subsidiary findings of fact unless they are \"clearly erroneous.\"  United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1167 (1st Cir.1993).  Further, we will uphold the district court's denial of a motion to suppress if it is supported by any reasonable view of the evidence.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these standards to the three factors allegedly requiring suppression of Burns' statements--Bethel's alleged promise, his choice of interrogation site, and Burns' mental state--we conclude that the District Judge correctly denied her motion to suppress.  First, while Burns testified that Bethel promised not to arrest her if she agreed to be interviewed, the Magistrate Judge who presided at the suppression hearing accepted Bethel's contrary testimony and found that he had never made such a promise.  Since the record contains sufficient evidence to support the Magistrate Judge's finding, the District Judge's acceptance of this finding was not clearly erroneous.  See United States v. Cruz Jimenez, 894 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Where there are two competing interpretations of the evidence, the district court's choice of one of them cannot be clearly erroneous.\").  Accordingly, Bethel's alleged promise not to prosecute Burns plays no role in our evaluation of whether her statements were voluntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we reject Burns' claim that Bethel chose an inherently coercive setting for the interview.  The record amply supports the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that Burns agreed to be interviewed at the post office after being informed that she was not under arrest and after voluntarily waiving her Miranda rights.  Moreover, Burns worked at the post office, and so was intimately familiar with the site Bethel chose for the interview.  Given that Burns agreed to be interviewed in familiar surroundings after being advised that she was under no obligation to speak, we cannot accept her claim that Bethel's decision to conduct the interview at the post office was inherently coercive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Burns contends that her statements were involuntary because they were a product of her weakened mental state.  Burns correctly conceded at the suppression hearing that, absent some evidence of coercive police conduct, the court could not find that her weakened mental state rendered her statements involuntary.  See Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 163-67, 107 S.Ct. 515, 519, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986);  United States v. Victoria-Peguero, 920 F.2d 77, 88 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2053, 114 L.Ed.2d 458 (1991).  Since we have already rejected Burns' contention that Bethel's conduct was coercive, we must reject her state of mind argument as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Reading from the Wrong Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns claims that the District Judge committed reversible error by mistakenly reading from a superseded indictment when he described the charged offenses in his preliminary jury instructions.  Because Burns did not object to the Judge's preliminary instructions, we are limited to \"plain error\" review.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  Accordingly, we will not reverse her conviction unless:  (1) the Judge erred;  (2) his error was \"clear\" or \"obvious\";  and (3) the error affected Burns' \"substantial rights,\" which in this case means that the claimed error probably affected the jury's verdict.  See United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).  Here, because Burns has failed to show that the court's error affected her substantial rights, her claim fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the District Judge mistakenly read from the original indictment during his preliminary instructions, this error could not have affected the jury's verdicts.  First, each of the original indictment's two counts tracked the language of the embezzlement statute and described each embezzlement's approximate date and place.  Second, the only difference between the two indictments is that the original indictment identified the embezzled test mailings solely by listing their fictitious addresses, whereas the superseding indictment also identified the payors and check numbers of the rebate checks that the mailings contained.  Since the original indictment provided Burns with enough information about the charged offenses to both prepare for trial and avoid double jeopardy, the additional information contained in the superseding indictment is mere surplusage.  See United States v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924, 929 (1st Cir.1987).  Moreover, the Judge's failure to read this surplusage to the jury could not have affected its verdicts because the contents of the embezzled test mailings were not in dispute.  See United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 892-94 (1st Cir.1993) (trying the defendant on an indictment containing insufficient detail concerning the charged offense was harmless error where defendant received advance notice of the government's trial theory and defendant had an adequate opportunity to respond at trial).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Hearsay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns next contends that the District Judge improperly excluded as hearsay certain testimony she offered to impeach the testimony of another witness.  Early in her case, Burns called her co-worker and friend, Cathy Larsen, as a character witness.  On cross-examination, Larsen stated that she had visited Burns after Bethel had confronted her about the missing mailings.  Larsen then testified that, while discussing the theft of the test mail, Burns told her that she \"had done something stupid,\" was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" and apologized for her conduct.  After calling several other witnesses, Burns called her roommate, Karen King.  King, who had been present with Burns during Larsen's visit, testified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>Q. On that night did Lisa make any statement saying she had taken checks?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>A. Never.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor objected to King's answer, claiming that the answer was hearsay.  Defense counsel responded that he was offering the testimony not to establish that Burns had never taken the checks, but to impeach Larsen's testimony that Burns had made the statements.  The Judge sustained the prosecutor's objection.  On appeal, Burns contends that exclusion of this testimony was reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that King should have been allowed to testify that Burns never admitted to taking the checks.  When the prosecutor elicited testimony from Larsen about Burns' statements, the prosecutor put those statements in dispute.  Burns then was entitled to produce testimony from another of the meeting's participants to refute the prosecutor's version of what was said.  Such testimony is not hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of Burns' out-of-court statements.  Since King was prepared to testify concerning her own observations of what was said during the meeting, her testimony should have been admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the trial judge erred, we decline to reverse Burns' conviction on this basis because his error was harmless.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).  Burns did not challenge the prosecutor's well-supported claim that she took the test mailings.  Under these circumstances, her statements to Larsen were harmful only to the extent that they might undermine her claim that she was so intoxicated when she took the checks that she did not remember doing so.  Even for this purpose, however, the statements are of limited probative value.  Burns allegedly made the statements after she was confronted by Bethel and accused of taking the mailings.  Having been so accused, and thus supposedly learning what she had done, it was entirely consistent with her intoxication defense for her to have expressed shame to her friends.  Given the limited value of Larsen's testimony, the fact that Burns was denied the opportunity to challenge it could not have affected the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The harmlessness of the Judge's error is underscored by another fact--that the prosecution did not need to rely on Larsen's testimony to establish that Burns acted with criminal intent.  In her statements to Bethel, Burns acknowledged taking the test mailings and described how she did so in detail.  It was this testimony, far more than Larsen's, that demolished Burns' claim that she was too intoxicated to remember taking the test mailings.  Accordingly, it was harmless error for the Judge to exclude King's testimony about her recollection of Burns' statements to Larsen.  See, e.g., United States v. Burke, 948 F.2d 23, 27-28 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. The Intoxication Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns' final claim is that the District Judge's intoxication instruction unconstitutionally required her to prove that she acted without criminal intent.  The Judge gave the following instruction on Burns' intoxication defense:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>Now, the defendant claims that she was so far overcome by the use of alcohol that it was impossible on the occasions for her to form the required specific intent, as I have just defined that intent to you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>I instruct you that you may consider evidence of alcohol use by the defendant, along with all of the other evidence, in deciding whether the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the requisite intent to, as I have described that to you.  (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns contends that the phrase \"defendant claims ... it was impossible\" suggested that Burns was required to prove that she acted without criminal intent.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intoxication instruction merely described the degree to which Burns' cognitive capacity must have been impaired before her alcohol use could support a finding of not guilty.  Immediately after instructing the jury on the issue, the Judge reminded the jury that the prosecution still had to prove that Burns acted with criminal intent.  When the two instructions are read together, they adequately apprised the jury that the prosecution had the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that Burns' alcohol use did not prevent her from intentionally committing the charged offenses.  Accordingly, we reject Burns' challenge to the Judge's intoxication instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, Burns' conviction is Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We also reject Burns' additional assertion that, because Bethel reduced the supervisor's oral summary of defendant's statements to writing, this written summary constitutes a recorded statement of the defendant subject to disclosure \"regardless of who the statement was made to or how it was occasioned.\"   Although the first subpart of Rule 16(a)(1)(A) makes a defendant's \"written or recorded statements\" discoverable irrespective of whether they were made in response to interrogation by a known government agent, we agree with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that an oral statement does not become \"written or recorded\" merely because a government agent made a written summary of the statement before trial.

Burns, a United States Post Office employee, was tried and convicted on two counts of embezzling mail in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1709.  She argues that we should reverse her conviction because:  (1) the prosecutor violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A) by failing to timely disclose a postal inspector's report summarizing statements Burns made to one of her supervisors;  (2) the District Judge erroneously admitted other allegedly involuntary statements Burns made to the investigating postal inspector;  (3) the Judge mistakenly read from a superseded indictment during his preliminary jury instructions;  (4) the Judge improperly excluded on hearsay grounds certain testimony Burns offered to impeach the testimony of another witness;  and (5) the Judge's jury instruction concerning Burns' intoxication defense unconstitutionally required her to prove that she acted without criminal intent.  Finding no reversible error in these claims, we affirm her conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lisa Burns first came to the attention of United States Postal Inspectors after Inspector Robert Bethel placed a routine \"test mailing\" at the Naples, Maine post office where Burns worked.  \"Test mailing\" is the Postal Service's method of determining whether employees at certain randomly-selected post offices are properly handling the mail.  The \"test mail\" is an envelope addressed to a fictitious person at a non-existent post office box at the targeted post office.  The envelope is typically marked \"refund inside\" and contains a rebate check made out to bearer.  The return address on the envelope specifies a post office box in the New England area controlled by the Postal Service.  If the mailing is handled properly, it is usually marked \"undeliverable\" and returned within two weeks.  If it is not returned, the postal inspector targets the post office for additional test mailings and attempts to determine what happened to the initial mailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first test mailing Bethel placed at the Naples post office contained a $5 rebate check.  When the mailing was not returned, Bethel recovered the cashed rebate check and determined that it had been endorsed by Burns.  Bethel then tried to tempt Burns with a second mailing containing a $10 rebate check.  It also disappeared.  This time, Bethel discovered that the rebate check apparently had been endorsed by Karen King, Burns' roommate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After failing to entice Burns with yet another test mailing, Bethel confronted her in the parking lot of the post office.  He identified himself, described the nature of his investigation, advised Burns that she was not under arrest, and asked her whether she would be willing to speak with him.  She agreed, and they returned to the post office.  Before beginning his questioning, Bethel read Burns her Miranda rights from a Postal Service waiver form.  He also had her initial each printed statement after it was read and sign the form at the end.  Burns then made several incriminating statements in response to Bethel's questions.  At the end of the interview, she wrote out and signed a statement memorializing her admissions.  Burns later sent Bethel a supplemental statement in which she alleged that she had an imperfect recollection of the incidents in question because she was an alcoholic and was intoxicated when she took the test mailings.  At trial, the government's case rested primarily on Bethel's testimony and Burns' admissions.  In response, Burns pleaded entrapment and intoxication.  The jury ultimately rejected her defenses and found Burns guilty on both counts.  She was later sentenced to 60 days confinement and fined $500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p>A. Pre-Trial Disclosure Pursuant to Rule 16</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns' primary argument on appeal is that the prosecutor violated Rule 16(a)(1)(A) by failing to disclose prior to trial a report summarizing statements Burns made to one of her supervisors.  In pertinent part, the rule provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Upon request of a defendant the government shall disclose to the defendant and make available for inspection, copying, or photographing:  ... that portion of any written record containing the substance of any relevant oral statement made by the defendant whether before or after arrest in response to interrogation by any person then known to the defendant to be a government agent....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns argues that her supervisor was a \"government agent\" and that she made her statements \"in response to interrogation.\"   Thus, she contends that the prosecutor was obligated to disclose the report pursuant to her pretrial request.  We reject Burns' arguments because we determine that Burns' supervisor was not a \"government agent\" as that term is used in Rule 16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 16 does not define \"government agent.\"   We therefore must choose between the two plausible definitions of the term.  Viewed broadly, the term encompasses anyone who performs duties of a public nature on behalf of the executive, legislative or judicial branches of the local, state or federal government.  Black's Law Dictionary 695-96 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \"government\" and \"government agent\").  Burns' supervisor would qualify as a government agent under this definition because he was employed by the United States Postal Service when the statements were made.  The competing definition is narrower and more colloquial.  It includes only persons with criminal law enforcement responsibilities or their agents.  See, e.g., Hoffa v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107318\"><a href=\"/opinion/107318/hoffa-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span>, 295, 305-07, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107318\"><a href=\"/opinion/107318/hoffa-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span> (1990).  Under this definition, Burns' supervisor would not qualify as a government agent since he had no criminal law enforcement responsibilities and was not acting as an agent of the postal inspectors when Burns made the incriminating statements.  The choice between these two definitions presents a question of law which we review de novo.  United States v.

When Rule 16 was amended in 1974 to include the language at issue, the amendment's drafters were working in a milieu in which courts were required to give special attention to statements obtained in response to interrogation by law enforcement officers.  See, e.g., Miranda v. Arizona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Obviously, Miranda and its progeny require suppression of a defendant's statements obtained through custodial interrogation unless the defendant properly waived his or her Miranda rights.  Id. at 444-45, 86 S.Ct. at 1612-13.   Moreover, even if a defendant was not in custody, his or her statements might still be suppressed if they were coerced through interrogation by law enforcement officers.  See, e.g., Rogers v.

Thus, if \"government agent\" refers only to law enforcement officials or persons acting on their behalf, the potential for pretrial suppression of statements that resulted from interrogation by such individuals provides a rational basis for limiting the government's pretrial disclosure obligation to summaries of statements made \"in response to interrogation.\"   The rational basis for the interrogation limitation disappears, however, if \"government agent\" is construed to mean government employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides enjoying strong contextual support, the narrow meaning of \"government agent\" avoids the arbitrariness that would result if the term were defined more expansively.  We agree that the broad reading of \"government agent\" gives maximum deference to the policies underlying Rule 16's mandatory disclosure rules.  See United States v.

Once it is divorced from the law enforcement context, however, this definition is problematic because it deteriorates into a completely arbitrary limitation on the prosecution's duty to disclose.  Under the term's broad reading, for example, the prosecution would be obligated to disclose portions of a report summarizing statements the defendant made to a government cook, but not those portions of the same report that summarize statements the defendant made to another cook at a privately-run diner.  Moreover, given that Rule 16 requires that the individual to whom the statements are made be \"then known to the defendant\" as a government agent, the prosecution would only be obligated to disclose the defendant's statements to the government cook if the defendant knew when she made the statements that the cook was a government employee.

Here, the narrower definition of \"government agent\" limits the government's pretrial disclosure obligation to summaries of those statements that are most likely to require a pretrial ruling before they are admitted into evidence.  By doing so, this definition serves the policies underlying Rule 16 without irrationally requiring the prosecution to base its disclosure determination on whether the defendant knows that the person to whom she is making her statements is a government employee.  We therefore agree with the trial court that, as used in Rule 16, \"government agent\" refers only to law enforcement agents or persons acting on their behalf.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>B. Voluntariness of Burns' Confession</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns next challenges the District Judge's denial of her motion to suppress the oral and written statements she made in response to questioning by Inspector Bethel.  She alleges that Bethel promised not to arrest her if she cooperated with his investigation.  She also claims that Bethel's questioning was inherently coercive because it occurred at the one-room post office in the presence of customers and her supervisor.  Finally, she contends that she was in a \"weakened psychological state\" during the interview because she was an alcoholic who had stopped drinking only two weeks earlier.  Based upon the totality of these factors, Burns claims that her statements were involuntary and therefore should have been suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the voluntariness of a confession, courts must apply the \"totality of the circumstances test.\"  Arizona v.

Further, we will uphold the district court's denial of a motion to suppress if it is supported by any reasonable view of the evidence.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these standards to the three factors allegedly requiring suppression of Burns' statements--Bethel's alleged promise, his choice of interrogation site, and Burns' mental state--we conclude that the District Judge correctly denied her motion to suppress.  First, while Burns testified that Bethel promised not to arrest her if she agreed to be interviewed, the Magistrate Judge who presided at the suppression hearing accepted Bethel's contrary testimony and found that he had never made such a promise.  Since the record contains sufficient evidence to support the Magistrate Judge's finding, the District Judge's acceptance of this finding was not clearly erroneous.  See United States v. Cruz Jimenez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535250\"><a href=\"/opinion/535250/united-states-v-jose-m-cruz-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Where there are two competing interpretations of the evidence, the district court's choice of one of them cannot be clearly erroneous.\").  Accordingly, Bethel's alleged promise not to prosecute Burns plays no role in our evaluation of whether her statements were voluntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we reject Burns' claim that Bethel chose an inherently coercive setting for the interview.  The record amply supports the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that Burns agreed to be interviewed at the post office after being informed that she was not under arrest and after voluntarily waiving her Miranda rights.  Moreover, Burns worked at the post office, and so was intimately familiar with the site Bethel chose for the interview.  Given that Burns agreed to be interviewed in familiar surroundings after being advised that she was under no obligation to speak, we cannot accept her claim that Bethel's decision to conduct the interview at the post office was inherently coercive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Burns contends that her statements were involuntary because they were a product of her weakened mental state.  Burns correctly conceded at the suppression hearing that, absent some evidence of coercive police conduct, the court could not find that her weakened mental state rendered her statements involuntary.

Reading from the Wrong Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns claims that the District Judge committed reversible error by mistakenly reading from a superseded indictment when he described the charged offenses in his preliminary jury instructions.  Because Burns did not object to the Judge's preliminary instructions, we are limited to \"plain error\" review.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  Accordingly, we will not reverse her conviction unless:  (1) the Judge erred;  (2) his error was \"clear\" or \"obvious\";  and (3) the error affected Burns' \"substantial rights,\" which in this case means that the claimed error probably affected the jury's verdict.  See United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></a></span>, 1777-78, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993).  Here, because Burns has failed to show that the court's error affected her substantial rights, her claim fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the District Judge mistakenly read from the original indictment during his preliminary instructions, this error could not have affected the jury's verdicts.  First, each of the original indictment's two counts tracked the language of the embezzlement statute and described each embezzlement's approximate date and place.  Second, the only difference between the two indictments is that the original indictment identified the embezzled test mailings solely by listing their fictitious addresses, whereas the superseding indictment also identified the payors and check numbers of the rebate checks that the mailings contained.  Since the original indictment provided Burns with enough information about the charged offenses to both prepare for trial and avoid double jeopardy, the additional information contained in the superseding indictment is mere surplusage.  See United States v. Serino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499044\"><a href=\"/opinion/499044/united-states-v-dominic-l-serino-united-states-of-america-v-john-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span>, 929 (1st Cir.1987).  Moreover, the Judge's failure to read this surplusage to the jury could not have affected its verdicts because the contents of the embezzled test mailings were not in dispute.  See United States v. Yefsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608076\"><a href=\"/opinion/608076/united-states-v-sheldon-arthur-yefsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 892-94 (1st Cir.1993) (trying the defendant on an indictment containing insufficient detail concerning the charged offense was harmless error where defendant received advance notice of the government's trial theory and defendant had an adequate opportunity to respond at trial).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Hearsay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns next contends that the District Judge improperly excluded as hearsay certain testimony she offered to impeach the testimony of another witness.  Early in her case, Burns called her co-worker and friend, Cathy Larsen, as a character witness.  On cross-examination, Larsen stated that she had visited Burns after Bethel had confronted her about the missing mailings.  Larsen then testified that, while discussing the theft of the test mail, Burns told her that she \"had done something stupid,\" was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" and apologized for her conduct.  After calling several other witnesses, Burns called her roommate, Karen King.  King, who had been present with Burns during Larsen's visit, testified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>Q. On that night did Lisa make any statement saying she had taken checks?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>A. Never.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor objected to King's answer, claiming that the answer was hearsay.  Defense counsel responded that he was offering the testimony not to establish that Burns had never taken the checks, but to impeach Larsen's testimony that Burns had made the statements.  The Judge sustained the prosecutor's objection.  On appeal, Burns contends that exclusion of this testimony was reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that King should have been allowed to testify that Burns never admitted to taking the checks.  When the prosecutor elicited testimony from Larsen about Burns' statements, the prosecutor put those statements in dispute.  Burns then was entitled to produce testimony from another of the meeting's participants to refute the prosecutor's version of what was said.  Such testimony is not hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of Burns' out-of-court statements.  Since King was prepared to testify concerning her own observations of what was said during the meeting, her testimony should have been admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the trial judge erred, we decline to reverse Burns' conviction on this basis because his error was harmless.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).  Burns did not challenge the prosecutor's well-supported claim that she took the test mailings.  Under these circumstances, her statements to Larsen were harmful only to the extent that they might undermine her claim that she was so intoxicated when she took the checks that she did not remember doing so.  Even for this purpose, however, the statements are of limited probative value.  Burns allegedly made the statements after she was confronted by Bethel and accused of taking the mailings.  Having been so accused, and thus supposedly learning what she had done, it was entirely consistent with her intoxication defense for her to have expressed shame to her friends.  Given the limited value of Larsen's testimony, the fact that Burns was denied the opportunity to challenge it could not have affected the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The harmlessness of the Judge's error is underscored by another fact--that the prosecution did not need to rely on Larsen's testimony to establish that Burns acted with criminal intent.  In her statements to Bethel, Burns acknowledged taking the test mailings and described how she did so in detail.  It was this testimony, far more than Larsen's, that demolished Burns' claim that she was too intoxicated to remember taking the test mailings.  Accordingly, it was harmless error for the Judge to exclude King's testimony about her recollection of Burns' statements to Larsen.  See, e.g., United States v. Burke, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571253\"><a href=\"/opinion/571253/united-states-v-gary-k-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 27-28 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. The Intoxication Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns' final claim is that the District Judge's intoxication instruction unconstitutionally required her to prove that she acted without criminal intent.  The Judge gave the following instruction on Burns' intoxication defense:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>Now, the defendant claims that she was so far overcome by the use of alcohol that it was impossible on the occasions for her to form the required specific intent, as I have just defined that intent to you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>I instruct you that you may consider evidence of alcohol use by the defendant, along with all of the other evidence, in deciding whether the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the requisite intent to, as I have described that to you.  (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns contends that the phrase \"defendant claims ... it was impossible\" suggested that Burns was required to prove that she acted without criminal intent.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intoxication instruction merely described the degree to which Burns' cognitive capacity must have been impaired before her alcohol use could support a finding of not guilty.  Immediately after instructing the jury on the issue, the Judge reminded the jury that the prosecution still had to prove that Burns acted with criminal intent.  When the two instructions are read together, they adequately apprised the jury that the prosecution had the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that Burns' alcohol use did not prevent her from intentionally committing the charged offenses.  Accordingly, we reject Burns' challenge to the Judge's intoxication instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, Burns' conviction is Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We also reject Burns' additional assertion that, because Bethel reduced the supervisor's oral summary of defendant's statements to writing, this written summary constitutes a recorded statement of the defendant subject to disclosure \"regardless of who the statement was made to or how it was occasioned.\"   Although the first subpart of Rule 16(a)(1)(A) makes a defendant's \"written or recorded statements\" discoverable irrespective of whether they were made in response to interrogation by a known government agent, we agree with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that an oral statement does not become \"written or recorded\" merely because a government agent made a written summary of the statement before trial.  In Re United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498131\"><a href=\"/opinion/498131/in-re-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span>, 284-85 (2d Cir.1987).  See also, e.g., United States v. McCure, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435867\"><a href=\"/opinion/435867/united-states-v-walter-h-mcclure-and-anthony-tafoya/\"><span class=\"volume\">734</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span>, 492-93 (10th Cir.1984).  This is especially true where, as here, the statement was actually heard by a third party and then reported to the government agent at a later date.  See In Re United States, 834 F.2d at 285-86</p>\n        <p>Finally, because we agree with the trial judge that Burns' supervisor was not a government agent, we need not decide whether Burns' statements were made \"in response to interrogation.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In reaching this conclusion, we do not endorse the prosecution's decision to withhold Bethel's report.  As the advisory committee notes to the Rule point out, \"[t]he rule is intended to prescribe the minimum amount of discovery to which the parties are entitled.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 16 advisory committee's note (1974 amendment) (West 1993)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Burns also argues that she was tried on the wrong indictment.  However, this argument does not merit extended discussion because it is not supported by the record.  At the close of the case, the judge instructed counsel to review both the indictment and the jury verdict form before they were submitted to the jury.  The record is devoid of any suggestion that counsel failed to ensure that it was the superseding indictment that was submitted.  We thus have no reason to determine whether Burns' conviction would have to be reversed if the jury had been asked to render its verdicts on the original indictment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The prosecution contends that Burns had no right to an intoxication instruction because intoxication is a diminished capacity defense barred by the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C.
