We  have jurisdiction\n\nover  petitioner's   appeal  under  Section  106(a)   of  the\n\nImmigration and  Nationality Act,  8 U.S.C.    1105a(a).   We\n\naffirm the decision and deportation order of the Board.\n\n          Petitioner raises three issues on appeal:  (1) that\n\nhe is entitled to  temporary refugee status under  the Fourth\n\nGeneva Convention;  (2) that  the Board's practice  of giving\n\n\"precedential  value\" to  Matter of  T, Int.  Dec. 3187  (BIA\n                                      \n\n1992) is an error of law; and (3) that he  has a well-founded\n\nfear  of persecution  in Sri  Lanka on  account of  political\n\nopinion,   imputed  political   opinion   and  social   group\n\nmembership.  We address  the issues seriatim.

In The Chinese Exclusion Case, 130 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n581 (1889), the Court upheld the right of Congress to exclude\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nChinese  laborers   from  the  United  States   even  if  the\n\nCongressional Act conflicted with treaties between the United\n\nStates and  China.  In  Fong Yue  Ting v.

Press,  347 U.S. 522, 530 (1954),  the\n                            \n\nCourt noted:\n\n             The   power   of  Congress   over  the\n          admission  of aliens  and their  right to\n          remain   is   necessarily   very   broad,\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          touching  as it  does  basic  aspects  of\n          national  sovereignty, more  particularly\n          our  foreign  relations and  the national\n          security.\n\n          In Kleindienst v.

Press it noted:\n                          \n\n             In   summary,  plenary   congressional\n          power  to make  policies  and  rules  for\n          exclusion of aliens  has long been firmly\n          established.

It is the  immigration laws of the  United States and\n\nthe case law interpreting them that control.\n\n                WHETHER THE BOARD'S PRACTICE \n                                             \n               OF GIVING PRECEDENTIAL VALUE TO \n                                               \n               THE MATTER OF T IS LEGAL ERROR.\n                                              \n\n          Petitioner objects  to the use of  the case, Matter\n                                                             \n\nof T, by the Board because \"it  concluded that Tamils are not\n    \n\npersecuted in Sri Lanka.\"  This is a very broad and basically\n\ninaccurate  statement  of   the  Board's  conclusions   which\n\nfollowed a detailed recitation of the violence that has taken\n\nplace  in Sri Lanka among  various ethnic groups.   The Board\n\nconcluded, \n\ninter alia:\n          \n\n             This  Board  in  turn appreciates  the\n          awful  circumstances  in  which  the  Sri\n          Lankan  Government  and large  numbers of\n          the  inhabitants  of  that  country  find\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          themselves.  But if we were to accept the\n          applicant's  assessment  of human  rights\n          violations  as  constituting  persecution\n          under  the  Act,  Tamils,   Moslems,  and\n          Sinhalese alike would  all be  persecuted\n          in  Sri Lanka.    Neither  the relief  of\n          asylum nor of withholding  of deportation\n          provides for refuge \"on account of\" human\n          rights abuses unconnected to  the grounds\n          enumerated  in  the   Act,  i.e.,   race,\n          religion,  nationality,  membership in  a\n          particular  social  group,  or  political\n          opinion.  See sections  208(a), 243(h)(1)\n                       \n          of  the Act;  section  101(a)(42) of  the\n          Act, 8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(42) (1988).\n\n          We  will not,  however, discuss  the merits  of the\n\nMatter of T.  We are not reviewing that  case, nor do we rely\n           \n\ndirectly  or indirectly  on its  conclusions or  statement of\n\nfacts.    Suffice it  to say  that  the Board  of Immigration\n\nAppeals, as  with any  other  agency that  renders a  written\n\nopinion  after a  hearing, has  a right  to rely  on its  own\n\ndecisions as  precedent until  that decision is  overruled by\n\nthe Board, one of the Courts of Appeals, or the United States\n\nSupreme Court.\n\n                WHETHER PETITIONER HAS A WELL-\n                                              \n            FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION ON ACCOUNT\n                                                  \n           OF POLITICAL OPINION, IMPUTED POLITICAL \n                                                   \n             OPINION, OR SOCIAL GROUP MEMBERSHIP.\n                                                 \n\n          This  issue requires us to read the record so as to\n\ndetermine  whether there  is substantial evidence  to support\n\nthe Board's decision.  Ravindran v. I.N.S., 976 F.2d 754, 758\n                                          \n\n(1st  Cir. 1992).  The  Board did not  assess the credibility\n\nfindings of  the Immigration  Law Judge \"because  even if  we\n\naccept  all of the respondent's testimony as true, he has not\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nsatisfied the well-founded fear standard of eligibility under\n\nthe Act.\" \n\nA)  Summary of the Record\n\n          The testimony  at  the  hearing  was  primarily  by\n\npetitioner.  Petitioner is an alien  from Sri Lanka.  He  was\n\npermitted to enter the  United States in 1983 as an  alien in\n\ntransit.   He has been in this  country since that time.  His\n\nvisa expired on November 30, 1985.  In his asylum application\n\npetitioner admitted that he  had stayed in the United  States\n\nlonger than  permitted under the  Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct  and  conceded  that  he  was  deportable.    His  asylum\n\napplication  states   that  he   has  never  been   detained,\n\ninterrogated,  convicted  or  sentenced  in  any  country  or\n\nmistreated by  Sri Lanka authorities.   Petitioner's wife and\n\ntwo children were permitted  to come to the United  States in\n\n1984 so that  his oldest son could receive medical treatment.\n\nA  third son  was  born after  his  wife entered  the  United\n\nStates.   Petitioner's wife and children now reside in Canada\n\nas refugees.  Petitioner testified that  he did not accompany\n\nhis  family  to  Canada   because  he  cannot  learn  another\n\nlanguage, is getting  old, and is under  medical treatment in\n\nthe United States.\n\n          Petitioner is  a Tamil, a minority  ethnic group in\n\nSri Lanka.  He was born a Hindu, but later became a Christian\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nbecause he \"had problems with the Sinhalese as a Hindu.\"  The\n\nSinhalese are the largest ethnic group in Sri Lanka.\n\n          Petitioner worked in Saudi Arabia under a five-year\n\ncontract starting February 6, 1978.  He returned to Sri Lanka\n\nfor a one-month vacation  each year.  In 1977  petitioner was\n\nattacked  by a group of Sinhalese while on a train travelling\n\nfrom Jaffna to Colombo.  This happened again in 1980.   After\n\nbeing attacked in 1980, petitioner ran away before the police\n\nand army could  attack him.  In March of  1981 he reported an\n\nincident to the police.  Although petitioner did not describe\n\nthe  incident, we will  assume that it  was another Sinhalese\n\nattack on him.  According to petitioner, the police told him:\n\n          Being a  Tamil you  should not  have even\n          come here.  We are not going to listen to\n          your statements.   We even know  that one\n          of  your brothers is involved in creating\n          troubles, and you have come  here to join\n          your  brother  to   help  your   brother,\n          therefore it  is  better for  you to  run\n          away from here,  otherwise we will murder\n          you.\n\nPetitioner replied  to the police  they were lying  about his\n\nbrother,  that  his  brother was  a  student  and worked  for\n\norganizations  that  looked  after  the needs  of  the  Tamil\n\npeople,  and that  his  brother was  a  scout for  the  Tamil\n\nstudent organization.\n\n          Petitioner  testified that,  to his  knowledge, his\n\nbrother did not belong  to any Tamil political organizations.\n\nHe explained  that,  as  a scout,  his  brother  helps  Tamil\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nrefugees who had been driven from their homes during communal\n\nriots and came to Jaffna  by ship.  The name of  this brother\n\nis Ganeswaran.\n\n          During one  of his  visits home from  Saudi Arabia,\n\nhis  parents told  him that  Ganeswaran had  been accused  of\n\ntaking part  in political  activities against  the government\n\nand had been jailed for three months.  Friends told him  that\n\nthey also  had  been imprisoned  for three  months, and  that\n\nduring the arrest of  his brother, the police had  dislocated\n\nGaneswaran's hand.\n\n          In  July of 1983, petitioner flew to Sri Lanka from\n\nSaudi  Arabia.  He had trouble leaving the airport because of\n\npeople openly hostile to Tamils.   He was told by  the police\n\nthat he could  leave the airport if he wished,  but they were\n\nnot prepared  to  give  him  any protection.    According  to\n\npetitioner,  \"[t]he  Army people  were  shouting:   'let  the\n\nTamils out, let the  Tamils out.  We will kill them.'\"   As a\n\nresult, petitioner  was forced to  stay in the  airport \"from\n\n8:00 a.m. on Saturday until 5:00 the following Sunday.\"\n\n          He  managed to get out of the airport with the help\n\nof  his roommate  who  was  a  Muslim.    His  roommate  gave\n\npetitioner a cap to wear signifying  that he was a Muslim and\n\nhe used  the name  of his roommate's  brother-in-law, Farook.\n\nHe and his roommate took a taxi to his roommate's house where\n\nhe stayed for about fifteen days.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          Petitioner, still disguised as a  Muslim, then went\n\nto his  parent's home where his  wife lived.   He only stayed\n\nthere for four or  five hours because his father  advised him\n\nto leave and go to his mother-in-law's house.  The reason for\n\nthis advice was  that the Army and  other people came  to the\n\nhome  of  petitioner's  parents frequently  looking  for  his\n\nbrother, Ganeswaran.   By  this time  Ganeswaran had gone  to\n\nIndia.    He  was, at  the  time  of the  hearing,  living in\n\nGermany.\n\n          After  petitioner  and his  wife  had  gone to  his\n\nmother-in-law's home, the  police visited his  parents' home.\n\nNoting that petitioner's wife was not there, the police found\n\nout   from     petitioner's  father   where  she   had  gone.\n\nPetitioner's father promptly told  petitioner that the police\n\nmight  go to  his  mother-in-law's home  and  advised him  to\n\nleave.   By  the  time the  police  arrived  at  petitioner's\n\nmother-in-law's home,  he  had gone  to Colombo  \"to save  my\n\nlife.\"\n\n          Petitioner decided to go to India.   He renewed his\n\npassport in  1983 by paying a broker 1000 rupees to go to the\n\npassport office  for him.   Petitioner  did this  because the\n\npolice  were looking for him  and the people  in the passport\n\noffice  were Sinhalese  and  \"they wouldn't  do  it for  me.\"\n\nPetitioner also  testified, however,  that he had  no problem\n\ngetting  his passport stamped each  time he came  back to Sri\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nLanka from Saudi Arabia  and returned to continue  working in\n\nSaudi  Arabia.  Petitioner  attributed this to  the fact that\n\nthose working in Saudi Arabia had no passport problems.\n\n          Petitioner was  told by his wife that  the Army had\n\ncome looking for him  while she was living with  her parents.\n\nShe also told him that the Army had shot her uncle.\n\n          Another  brother  of  petitioner,  Rajeswaran,  was\n\narrested by security personnel on his return  to Saudi Arabia\n\nfrom Sri  Lanka.  The reason  for the arrest was  that it was\n\nsuspected that Rajeswaran was sending money from Saudi Arabia\n\nto the Tamil  Tigers.   The Tamil Tigers  is an  organization\n\nthat  uses violence to try to  achieve its goal of a separate\n\nTamil state.\n\n          On June 3, 1987, petitioner,  who was in the United\n\nStates, was informed by telephone that his brother Rajeswaran\n\nhad been arrested on June 2 at the airport on his way back to\n\nSaudi  Arabia.   Petitioner  made arrangements  to raise  the\n\n50,000 rupees  necessary to  bail his  brother  out of  jail.\n\nPetitioner also called the company his  brother worked for in\n\nSaudi Arabia to ensure  that his brother could return  to his\n\njob.   Petitioner talked to  his brother on  the phone before\n\nhis return to Saudi Arabia.  His brother told petitioner that\n\nhe ached all  over and  was \"really suffering.\"   He  advised\n\npetitioner never  to come back to  Sri Lanka.  At  the end of\n\nJuly  petitioner's brother called him  from Saudi Arabia.  He\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\ntold petitioner that \"the  Ceylon Army and Police  had kicked\n\nhim, used the bayonet,  and put his face in a  chili bag.\"  A\n\nchili bag contains \"chilies\" that burn a person's face.\n\n          After petitioner's brother,  Rajeswaran, went  back\n\nto Saudi Arabia to work, police came to the house looking for\n\nhim.  His family abandoned their house and moved about twelve\n\nmiles away.   The house was partly destroyed  by a shell that\n\nhit the house during a  battle between government forces  and\n\nTamil guerrillas.  Petitioner  testified, \"I feel it was  for\n\nus.\"\n\n          In  late 1983 petitioner decided not to go to India\n\nas he  had intended, but to  come to the United  States.  His\n\nchange of mind was  based on a job offer  on a ship that  was\n\nsupposedly  berthed in  Wilmington.   Petitioner flew  to New\n\nYork City, arriving there on November 27, 1983.  He  has been\n\nin  the United  States  since  that  date.    The  job  never\n\nmaterialized  so  petitioner came  to  Boston,  where he  has\n\nrelatives.  \n\n          About a week after he arrived in the United States,\n\npetitioner  joined the  Tamil  Eelam  Association, which  \"is\n\nfighting for freedom  and some form of  consolation [sic] for\n\nthe Tamils to  live in our  country.\"  As  a member of  Tamil\n\nEelam, petitioner  has participated in three  marches held in\n\nWashington and three other marches held in Cambridge, Boston,\n\nand   New  York   City.     Videotapes  were   made   of  the\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\ndemonstrations  and  pictures taken  of  the  participants by\n\nmembers of the Sri Lankan Embassy.\n\n          Petitioner testified  that after joining  the Tamil\n\nEelam  and participating in their marches, he is afraid to go\n\nback to Sri Lanka.  He thinks that he might be  shot and said\n\nthat, \"a man who is a  mechanic who studied with me was shot,\n\nfor no reason, and this can happen to me, too.\"  Petitioner's\n\nfear of returning to  Sri Lanka is based  on his Tamil  Eelam\n\nactivities  in the  United States.   He  was not  involved in\n\npolitics in Sri Lanka.\n\n          Petitioner is  aware of  an  agreement between  Sri\n\nLanka and India under the terms of which persons in detention\n\nwould be released, the  police and army would be  relieved of\n\ntheir duties in  the north and east of Sri  Lanka and general\n\nelections would be held there.  Petitioner did not think that\n\nthe  agreement was favorable to  the Tamils, despite the fact\n\nthat   it  was   supported  by   Tamil  Eelam.     Petitioner\n\nacknowledged that  the terrorist  organization  known as  the\n\nTamil Tigers is opposed  to the peace agreement.   Petitioner\n\ndenied that he would  fight with the Tigers, but  stated that\n\nhe  agreed with their goal  of a separate  government for the\n\nTamils.  It  is petitioner's opinion  that unless the  Tamils\n\nhave a  country of their own  they will never be  safe in Sri\n\nLanka.   The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nprohibits any form of support for  an independent Tamil state\n\nanywhere.\n\n          At  the time  the  petitioner's hearing  came to  a\n\nclose,  his  parents,  four  sisters,  and  another  brother,\n\nRatnaeswaran, were living in Sri Lanka.\n\nB)  The Applicable Law\n                      \n\n          8 U.S.C.   1158(a) provides:\n\n             The Attorney General shall establish a\n          procedure for an alien physically present\n          in the United States  or at a land border\n          or  port of  entry, irrespective  of such\n          alien's  status, to apply for asylum, and\n          the alien  may be  granted asylum  in the\n          discretion of the Attorney General if the\n          Attorney  General  determines  that  such\n          alien is  a refugee within the meaning of\n          section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title.\n\nThe pertinent part of section 1101(a)(42)(A) states:\n\n             The  term  \"refugee\"  means   (A)  any\n          person who is outside any country of such\n          person's  nationality .  . .  and  who is\n          unable or unwilling to return to,  and is\n          unable or  unwilling to avail  himself or\n          herself  of  the   protection  of,   that\n          country because of persecution or a well-\n          founded fear of persecution on account of\n          race,  religion, nationality,  membership\n          in   a   particular   social  group,   or\n          political opinion.\n\n          We  note that  in this  case there  is no  claim of\n\npersecution of petitioner while he  was living in Sri  Lanka.\n\nHis asylum application states that he was never mistreated by\n\nSri  Lankan  authorities.    The  only  question  is  whether\n\npetitioner  has a well-founded  fear of persecution  if he is\n\nreturned to Sri Lanka.   Petitioner has the burden  of proof.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nRavindran,  976 F.2d  at 758;  Alvarez-Flores v.

The\n          objective component, on  the other  hand,\n          contemplates that the applicant show \"'by\n          credible, direct,  and specific evidence,\n          ... facts that would support a reasonable\n          fear    that    the   petitioner    faces\n          persecution.'\"   Alvarez-Flores, 909 F.2d\n                                         \n          at 5 (quoting\n                       \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          Diaz-Escobar  v.

An  alien, such  as\n       \n\npetitioner, seeking asylum  need only prove that  his fear is\n\ngenuine  and reasonable.  Khalaf v.

This lessened  burden has  been, however,\n\noffset  somewhat by  the  Court's recent  heightening of  the\n\ndeference  due  the Board's  decision.   In  order  to obtain\n\njudicial reversal of the Board's determination, petitioner\n\n          must show that  the evidence he presented\n          was  so  compelling  that  no  reasonable\n          factfinder   could   fail  to   find  the\n          requisite fear of persecution.\n\nI.N.S. v.

We have required, however, that\n          this   violence   create  a   pattern  of\n          persecution    closely   tied    to   the\n          petitioner.     Allegations  of  isolated\n          violence are not enough.  \n\nArriaga-Barrientos  v. I.N.S.,  937 F.2d  411, 414  (9th Cir.\n                             \n\n1991) (citations  omitted).  The authorities  were interested\n\nin petitioner's  brother, Ganeswaran, not petitioner,  and it\n\nwas Ganeswaran who  was assaulted and arrested by the police.\n\nPetitioner  was  in  the   United  States  when  his  brother\n\nRajeswaran was  arrested and beaten.  We think it significant\n\nthat petitioner was able, by telephone, to obtain the release\n\nof his brother  from jail  and arrange for  Rajeswaran to  go\n\nback to work in Saudi Arabia.  We cannot ignore the fact that\n\npetitioner's parents, four sisters, and a brother continue to\n\nlive in Sri Lanka.\n\n          As we  pointed out in  Ravindran, 976 F.2d  at 759:\n                                          \n\n\"Generally, evidence of widespread violence and human  rights\n\nviolations   affecting  all   citizens  is   insufficient  to\n\nestablish persecution.\"   Ravindran is a  case practically on\n                                   \n\nall  fours with  this one.   It  involved a  Tamil petitioner\n\nclaiming  a  well-founded  fear  of persecution  if  he  were\n\ndeported.   The decision in Ravindran  is, therefore, binding\n                                     \n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\non us.  Petitioner does not refer to Ravindran at  all in his\n                                              \n\nbrief.\n\n          There is  no evidence that  the political opinions,\n\ngoals  and methods of the  Tamil Tigers have  been imputed to\n\nthe petitioner by the  Sri Lankan authorities.  Nor  is there\n\nevidence that the Sri Lankan authorities know of petitioner's\n\nmembership in the Tamil Eelam Association.  But even assuming\n\nthat  they do know, there  is no evidence  that membership on\n\nthe Tamil Eelam would result in persecution.  The Tamil Eelam\n\nsupports the peace pact between Sri Lanka and India.\n\n          Nor   is  there  any   evidence  that  petitioner's\n\nadvocacy of  an independent  Tamil state  will result  in his\n\npersecution because it may  have violated the Sixth Amendment\n\nto the Constitution  of Sri Lanka.   Petitioner's advocacy of\n\nan  independent Tamil state took place  in the United States.\n\nThere  is no evidence that  the authorities in  Sri Lanka are\n\naware  of petitioner's views.  There is nothing in the record\n\nsuggesting that Sri Lankan authorities have persecuted Tamils\n\nfor opinions expressed in another country.  \n\n          There  is in  the record  a  letter from  the State\n\nDepartment to  the Immigration Examiner containing  a copy of\n\nthe  January 1984  State  Department Report  on Human  Rights\n\nPractices in Sri Lanka for the calendar year 1983 which gives\n\na different perspective  on the  situation in Sri  Lanka.   A\n\nportion of the report states:\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\n             In  general,  and   as  explained   in\n          greater  detail  in  the  enclosed  human\n          rights  report,  there  is  distrust  and\n          animosity between Tamils and the majority\n          Sinhalese   of   Sri  Lanka.     Communal\n          tensions led  in  mid-1983 to  the  worst\n          outbreak of violence  and lawlessness  to\n          have  occurred  in  Sri Lanka  in  recent\n          history.  In a  week of rioting,  several\n          hundred people were killed  and thousands\n          lost   their   homes.     The  Government\n          restored  order in  early August  and has\n          succeeded in maintaining the  peace since\n          then, but tensions  remain.  Many  of the\n          Tamils affected by the  violence suffered\n          great personal and  property losses,  and\n          some  fear there will  be a recurrence of\n          violence.   But  any threat  against  the\n          peace  and well-being  of Tamils,  and of\n          all Sri Lankans,  arises from tensions in\n          society, and  not from  a  policy of  the\n          Government to persecute  or to allow  the\n          persecution of Tamils or any other group.\n          The  leaders  of   the  Government,   who\n          include Tamils, strive to protect all Sri\n          Lankans.   Illegal discrimination against\n          Tamils  does not occur  with the sanction\n          of the Government.\n\n          Whether  petitioner  will  suffer  violence  on his\n\nreturn to  Sri Lanka, we do  not know.  We  do know, however,\n\nthat there is no principled basis for overturning the Board's\n\ndecision.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n",

The Board concluded, inter alia:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Board in turn appreciates the awful circumstances in which the Sri Lankan Government and large numbers of the inhabitants of that country find themselves.  But if we were to accept the applicant's assessment of human rights violations as constituting persecution under the Act, Tamils, Moslems, and Sinhalese alike would all be persecuted in Sri Lanka.  Neither the relief of asylum nor of withholding of deportation provides for refuge \"on account of\" human rights abuses unconnected to the grounds enumerated in the Act, i.e., race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.  See sections 208(a), 243(h)(1) of the Act;  section 101(a)(42) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.

Ravindran v. I.N.S., 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992).  The Board did not assess the credibility findings of the Immigration Law Judge \"because even if we accept all of the respondent's testimony as true, he has not satisfied the well-founded fear standard of eligibility under the Act.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A) Summary of the Record</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony at the hearing was primarily by petitioner.  Petitioner is an alien from Sri Lanka.  He was permitted to enter the United States in 1983 as an alien in transit.  He has been in this country since that time.  His visa expired on November 30, 1985.  In his asylum application petitioner admitted that he had stayed in the United States longer than permitted under the Immigration and Nationality Act and conceded that he was deportable.  His asylum application states that he has never been detained, interrogated, convicted or sentenced in any country or mistreated by Sri Lanka authorities.  Petitioner's wife and two children were permitted to come to the United States in 1984 so that his oldest son could receive medical treatment.  A third son was born after his wife entered the United States.  Petitioner's wife and children now reside in Canada as refugees.  Petitioner testified that he did not accompany his family to Canada because he cannot learn another language, is getting old, and is under medical treatment in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner is a Tamil, a minority ethnic group in Sri Lanka.  He was born a Hindu, but later became a Christian because he \"had problems with the Sinhalese as a Hindu.\"  The Sinhalese are the largest ethnic group in Sri Lanka.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner worked in Saudi Arabia under a five-year contract starting February 6, 1978.  He returned to Sri Lanka for a one-month vacation each year.  In 1977 petitioner was attacked by a group of Sinhalese while on a train travelling from Jaffna to Colombo.  This happened again in 1980.  After being attacked in 1980, petitioner ran away before the police and army could attack him.  In March of 1981 he reported an incident to the police.  Although petitioner did not describe the incident, we will assume that it was another Sinhalese attack on him.  According to petitioner, the police told him:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Being a Tamil you should not have even come here.  We are not going to listen to your statements.  We even know that one of your brothers is involved in creating troubles, and you have come here to join your brother to help your brother, therefore it is better for you to run away from here, otherwise we will murder you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner replied to the police they were lying about his brother, that his brother was a student and worked for organizations that looked after the needs of the Tamil people, and that his brother was a scout for the Tamil student organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner testified that, to his knowledge, his brother did not belong to any Tamil political organizations.  He explained that, as a scout, his brother helps Tamil refugees who had been driven from their homes during communal riots and came to Jaffna by ship.  The name of this brother is Ganeswaran.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During one of his visits home from Saudi Arabia, his parents told him that Ganeswaran had been accused of taking part in political activities against the government and had been jailed for three months.  Friends told him that they also had been imprisoned for three months, and that during the arrest of his brother, the police had dislocated Ganeswaran's hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July of 1983, petitioner flew to Sri Lanka from Saudi Arabia.  He had trouble leaving the airport because of people openly hostile to Tamils.  He was told by the police that he could leave the airport if he wished, but they were not prepared to give him any protection.  According to petitioner, \"[t]he Army people were shouting:  'let the Tamils out, let the Tamils out.  We will kill them.' \"  As a result, petitioner was forced to stay in the airport \"from 8:00 a.m.  on Saturday until 5:00 the following Sunday.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He managed to get out of the airport with the help of his roommate who was a Muslim.  His roommate gave petitioner a cap to wear signifying that he was a Muslim and he used the name of his roommate's brother-in-law, Farook.  He and his roommate took a taxi to his roommate's house where he stayed for about fifteen days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner, still disguised as a Muslim, then went to his parent's home where his wife lived.  He only stayed there for four or five hours because his father advised him to leave and go to his mother-in-law's house.  The reason for this advice was that the Army and other people came to the home of petitioner's parents frequently looking for his brother, Ganeswaran.  By this time Ganeswaran had gone to India.  He was, at the time of the hearing, living in Germany.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After petitioner and his wife had gone to his mother- in-law's home, the police visited his parents' home.  Noting that petitioner's wife was not there, the police found out from petitioner's father where she had gone.  Petitioner's father promptly told petitioner that the police might go to his mother-in-law's home and advised him to leave.  By the time the police arrived at petitioner's mother-in-law's home, he had gone to Colombo \"to save my life.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner decided to go to India.  He renewed his passport in 1983 by paying a broker 1000 rupees to go to the passport office for him.  Petitioner did this because the police were looking for him and the people in the passport office were Sinhalese and \"they wouldn't do it for me.\"  Petitioner also testified, however, that he had no problem getting his passport stamped each time he came back to Sri Lanka from Saudi Arabia and returned to continue working in Saudi Arabia.  Petitioner attributed this to the fact that those working in Saudi Arabia had no passport problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner was told by his wife that the Army had come looking for him while she was living with her parents.  She also told him that the Army had shot her uncle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another brother of petitioner, Rajeswaran, was arrested by security personnel on his return to Saudi Arabia from Sri Lanka.  The reason for the arrest was that it was suspected that Rajeswaran was sending money from Saudi Arabia to the Tamil Tigers.  The Tamil Tigers is an organization that uses violence to try to achieve its goal of a separate Tamil state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 3, 1987, petitioner, who was in the United States, was informed by telephone that his brother Rajeswaran had been arrested on June 2 at the airport on his way back to Saudi Arabia.  Petitioner made arrangements to raise the 50,000 rupees necessary to bail his brother out of jail.  Petitioner also called the company his brother worked for in Saudi Arabia to ensure that his brother could return to his job.  Petitioner talked to his brother on the phone before his return to Saudi Arabia.  His brother told petitioner that he ached all over and was \"really suffering.\"  He advised petitioner never to come back to Sri Lanka.  At the end of July petitioner's brother called him from Saudi Arabia.  He told petitioner that \"the Ceylon Army and Police had kicked him, used the bayonet, and put his face in a chili bag.\"  A chili bag contains \"chilies\" that burn a person's face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After petitioner's brother, Rajeswaran, went back to Saudi Arabia to work, police came to the house looking for him.  His family abandoned their house and moved about twelve miles away.  The house was partly destroyed by a shell that hit the house during a battle between government forces and Tamil guerrillas.  Petitioner testified, \"I feel it was for us.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1983 petitioner decided not to go to India as he had intended, but to come to the United States.  His change of mind was based on a job offer on a ship that was supposedly berthed in Wilmington.  Petitioner flew to New York City, arriving there on November 27, 1983.  He has been in the United States since that date.  The job never materialized so petitioner came to Boston, where he has relatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About a week after he arrived in the United States, petitioner joined the Tamil Eelam Association, which \"is fighting for freedom and some form of consolation [sic] for the Tamils to live in our country.\"  As a member of Tamil Eelam, petitioner has participated in three marches held in Washington and three other marches held in Cambridge, Boston, and New York City.  Videotapes were made of the demonstrations and pictures taken of the participants by members of the Sri Lankan Embassy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner testified that after joining the Tamil Eelam and participating in their marches, he is afraid to go back to Sri Lanka.  He thinks that he might be shot and said that, \"a man who is a mechanic who studied with me was shot, for no reason, and this can happen to me, too.\"  Petitioner's fear of returning to Sri Lanka is based on his Tamil Eelam activities in the United States.  He was not involved in politics in Sri Lanka.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner is aware of an agreement between Sri Lanka and India under the terms of which persons in detention would be released, the police and army would be relieved of their duties in the north and east of Sri Lanka and general elections would be held there.  Petitioner did not think that the agreement was favorable to the Tamils, despite the fact that it was supported by Tamil Eelam.  Petitioner acknowledged that the terrorist organization known as the Tamil Tigers is opposed to the peace agreement.  Petitioner denied that he would fight with the Tigers, but stated that he agreed with their goal of a separate government for the Tamils.  It is petitioner's opinion that unless the Tamils have a country of their own they will never be safe in Sri Lanka.  The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka prohibits any form of support for an independent Tamil state anywhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the petitioner's hearing came to a close, his parents, four sisters, and another brother, Ratnaeswaran, were living in Sri Lanka.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B) The Applicable Law</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. Sec. 1158(a) provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General shall establish a procedure for an alien physically present in the United States or at a land border or port of entry, irrespective of such alien's status, to apply for asylum, and the alien may be granted asylum in the discretion of the Attorney General if the Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent part of section 1101(a)(42)(A) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"refugee\" means (A) any person who is outside any country of such person's nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that in this case there is no claim of persecution of petitioner while he was living in Sri Lanka.  His asylum application states that he was never mistreated by Sri Lankan authorities.  The only question is whether petitioner has a well-founded fear of persecution if he is returned to Sri Lanka.  Petitioner has the burden of proof.   Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 758;  Alvarez-Flores v. I.N.S., 909 F.2d l, 3 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are subjective and objective components to the well-founded fear standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subjective component requires that the asserted fear be genuine.

I.N.S., 909 F.2d 589, 591 (1st Cir. 1990).  This lessened burden has been, however, offset somewhat by the Court's recent heightening of the deference due the Board's decision.

We have required, however, that this violence create a pattern of persecution closely tied to the petitioner.  Allegations of isolated violence are not enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arriaga-Barrientos v. I.N.S., 937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir. 1991) (citations omitted).  The authorities were interested in petitioner's brother, Ganeswaran, not petitioner, and it was Ganeswaran who was assaulted and arrested by the police.  Petitioner was in the United States when his brother Rajeswaran was arrested and beaten.  We think it significant that petitioner was able, by telephone, to obtain the release of his brother from jail and arrange for Rajeswaran to go back to work in Saudi Arabia.  We cannot ignore the fact that petitioner's parents, four sisters, and a brother continue to live in Sri Lanka.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we pointed out in  Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 759:  \"Generally, evidence of widespread violence and human rights violations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish persecution.\"  Ravindran is a case practically on all fours with this one.  It involved a Tamil petitioner claiming a well- founded fear of persecution if he were deported.  The decision in Ravindran is, therefore, binding on us.  Petitioner does not refer to Ravindran at all in his brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that the political opinions, goals and methods of the Tamil Tigers have been imputed to the petitioner by the Sri Lankan authorities.  Nor is there evidence that the Sri Lankan authorities know of petitioner's membership in the Tamil Eelam Association.  But even assuming that they do know, there is no evidence that membership on the Tamil Eelam would result in persecution.  The Tamil Eelam supports the peace pact between Sri Lanka and India.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any evidence that petitioner's advocacy of an independent Tamil state will result in his persecution because it may have violated the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka.  Petitioner's advocacy of an independent Tamil state took place in the United States.  There is no evidence that the authorities in Sri Lanka are aware of petitioner's views.  There is nothing in the record suggesting that Sri Lankan authorities have persecuted Tamils for opinions expressed in another country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is in the record a letter from the State Department to the Immigration Examiner containing a copy of the January 1984 State Department Report on Human Rights Practices in Sri Lanka for the calendar year 1983 which gives a different perspective on the situation in Sri Lanka.  A portion of the report states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, and as explained in greater detail in the enclosed human rights report, there is distrust and animosity between Tamils and the majority Sinhalese of Sri Lanka.  Communal tensions led in mid-1983 to the worst outbreak of violence and lawlessness to have occurred in Sri Lanka in recent history.  In a week of rioting, several hundred people were killed and thousands lost their homes.  The Government restored order in early August and has succeeded in maintaining the peace since then, but tensions remain.  Many of the Tamils affected by the violence suffered great personal and property losses, and some fear there will be a recurrence of violence.  But any threat against the peace and well-being of Tamils, and of all Sri Lankans, arises from tensions in society, and not from a policy of the Government to persecute or to allow the persecution of Tamils or any other group.  The leaders of the Government, who include Tamils, strive to protect all Sri Lankans.  Illegal discrimination against Tamils does not occur with the sanction of the Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether petitioner will suffer violence on his return to Sri Lanka, we do not know.

The Board concluded, inter alia:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Board in turn appreciates the awful circumstances in which the Sri Lankan Government and large numbers of the inhabitants of that country find themselves.  But if we were to accept the applicant's assessment of human rights violations as constituting persecution under the Act, Tamils, Moslems, and Sinhalese alike would all be persecuted in Sri Lanka.  Neither the relief of asylum nor of withholding of deportation provides for refuge \"on account of\" human rights abuses unconnected to the grounds enumerated in the Act, i.e., race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.  See sections 208(a), 243(h)(1) of the Act;  section 101(a)(42) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.

The Board did not assess the credibility findings of the Immigration Law Judge \"because even if we accept all of the respondent's testimony as true, he has not satisfied the well-founded fear standard of eligibility under the Act.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A) Summary of the Record</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony at the hearing was primarily by petitioner.  Petitioner is an alien from Sri Lanka.  He was permitted to enter the United States in 1983 as an alien in transit.  He has been in this country since that time.  His visa expired on November 30, 1985.  In his asylum application petitioner admitted that he had stayed in the United States longer than permitted under the Immigration and Nationality Act and conceded that he was deportable.  His asylum application states that he has never been detained, interrogated, convicted or sentenced in any country or mistreated by Sri Lanka authorities.  Petitioner's wife and two children were permitted to come to the United States in 1984 so that his oldest son could receive medical treatment.  A third son was born after his wife entered the United States.  Petitioner's wife and children now reside in Canada as refugees.  Petitioner testified that he did not accompany his family to Canada because he cannot learn another language, is getting old, and is under medical treatment in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner is a Tamil, a minority ethnic group in Sri Lanka.  He was born a Hindu, but later became a Christian because he \"had problems with the Sinhalese as a Hindu.\"  The Sinhalese are the largest ethnic group in Sri Lanka.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner worked in Saudi Arabia under a five-year contract starting February 6, 1978.  He returned to Sri Lanka for a one-month vacation each year.  In 1977 petitioner was attacked by a group of Sinhalese while on a train travelling from Jaffna to Colombo.  This happened again in 1980.  After being attacked in 1980, petitioner ran away before the police and army could attack him.  In March of 1981 he reported an incident to the police.  Although petitioner did not describe the incident, we will assume that it was another Sinhalese attack on him.  According to petitioner, the police told him:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Being a Tamil you should not have even come here.  We are not going to listen to your statements.  We even know that one of your brothers is involved in creating troubles, and you have come here to join your brother to help your brother, therefore it is better for you to run away from here, otherwise we will murder you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner replied to the police they were lying about his brother, that his brother was a student and worked for organizations that looked after the needs of the Tamil people, and that his brother was a scout for the Tamil student organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner testified that, to his knowledge, his brother did not belong to any Tamil political organizations.  He explained that, as a scout, his brother helps Tamil refugees who had been driven from their homes during communal riots and came to Jaffna by ship.  The name of this brother is Ganeswaran.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During one of his visits home from Saudi Arabia, his parents told him that Ganeswaran had been accused of taking part in political activities against the government and had been jailed for three months.  Friends told him that they also had been imprisoned for three months, and that during the arrest of his brother, the police had dislocated Ganeswaran's hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July of 1983, petitioner flew to Sri Lanka from Saudi Arabia.  He had trouble leaving the airport because of people openly hostile to Tamils.  He was told by the police that he could leave the airport if he wished, but they were not prepared to give him any protection.  According to petitioner, \"[t]he Army people were shouting:  'let the Tamils out, let the Tamils out.  We will kill them.' \"  As a result, petitioner was forced to stay in the airport \"from 8:00 a.m.  on Saturday until 5:00 the following Sunday.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He managed to get out of the airport with the help of his roommate who was a Muslim.  His roommate gave petitioner a cap to wear signifying that he was a Muslim and he used the name of his roommate's brother-in-law, Farook.  He and his roommate took a taxi to his roommate's house where he stayed for about fifteen days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner, still disguised as a Muslim, then went to his parent's home where his wife lived.  He only stayed there for four or five hours because his father advised him to leave and go to his mother-in-law's house.  The reason for this advice was that the Army and other people came to the home of petitioner's parents frequently looking for his brother, Ganeswaran.  By this time Ganeswaran had gone to India.  He was, at the time of the hearing, living in Germany.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After petitioner and his wife had gone to his mother- in-law's home, the police visited his parents' home.  Noting that petitioner's wife was not there, the police found out from petitioner's father where she had gone.  Petitioner's father promptly told petitioner that the police might go to his mother-in-law's home and advised him to leave.  By the time the police arrived at petitioner's mother-in-law's home, he had gone to Colombo \"to save my life.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner decided to go to India.  He renewed his passport in 1983 by paying a broker 1000 rupees to go to the passport office for him.  Petitioner did this because the police were looking for him and the people in the passport office were Sinhalese and \"they wouldn't do it for me.\"  Petitioner also testified, however, that he had no problem getting his passport stamped each time he came back to Sri Lanka from Saudi Arabia and returned to continue working in Saudi Arabia.  Petitioner attributed this to the fact that those working in Saudi Arabia had no passport problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner was told by his wife that the Army had come looking for him while she was living with her parents.  She also told him that the Army had shot her uncle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another brother of petitioner, Rajeswaran, was arrested by security personnel on his return to Saudi Arabia from Sri Lanka.  The reason for the arrest was that it was suspected that Rajeswaran was sending money from Saudi Arabia to the Tamil Tigers.  The Tamil Tigers is an organization that uses violence to try to achieve its goal of a separate Tamil state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 3, 1987, petitioner, who was in the United States, was informed by telephone that his brother Rajeswaran had been arrested on June 2 at the airport on his way back to Saudi Arabia.  Petitioner made arrangements to raise the 50,000 rupees necessary to bail his brother out of jail.  Petitioner also called the company his brother worked for in Saudi Arabia to ensure that his brother could return to his job.  Petitioner talked to his brother on the phone before his return to Saudi Arabia.  His brother told petitioner that he ached all over and was \"really suffering.\"  He advised petitioner never to come back to Sri Lanka.  At the end of July petitioner's brother called him from Saudi Arabia.  He told petitioner that \"the Ceylon Army and Police had kicked him, used the bayonet, and put his face in a chili bag.\"  A chili bag contains \"chilies\" that burn a person's face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After petitioner's brother, Rajeswaran, went back to Saudi Arabia to work, police came to the house looking for him.  His family abandoned their house and moved about twelve miles away.  The house was partly destroyed by a shell that hit the house during a battle between government forces and Tamil guerrillas.  Petitioner testified, \"I feel it was for us.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1983 petitioner decided not to go to India as he had intended, but to come to the United States.  His change of mind was based on a job offer on a ship that was supposedly berthed in Wilmington.  Petitioner flew to New York City, arriving there on November 27, 1983.  He has been in the United States since that date.  The job never materialized so petitioner came to Boston, where he has relatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About a week after he arrived in the United States, petitioner joined the Tamil Eelam Association, which \"is fighting for freedom and some form of consolation [sic] for the Tamils to live in our country.\"  As a member of Tamil Eelam, petitioner has participated in three marches held in Washington and three other marches held in Cambridge, Boston, and New York City.  Videotapes were made of the demonstrations and pictures taken of the participants by members of the Sri Lankan Embassy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner testified that after joining the Tamil Eelam and participating in their marches, he is afraid to go back to Sri Lanka.  He thinks that he might be shot and said that, \"a man who is a mechanic who studied with me was shot, for no reason, and this can happen to me, too.\"  Petitioner's fear of returning to Sri Lanka is based on his Tamil Eelam activities in the United States.  He was not involved in politics in Sri Lanka.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner is aware of an agreement between Sri Lanka and India under the terms of which persons in detention would be released, the police and army would be relieved of their duties in the north and east of Sri Lanka and general elections would be held there.  Petitioner did not think that the agreement was favorable to the Tamils, despite the fact that it was supported by Tamil Eelam.  Petitioner acknowledged that the terrorist organization known as the Tamil Tigers is opposed to the peace agreement.  Petitioner denied that he would fight with the Tigers, but stated that he agreed with their goal of a separate government for the Tamils.  It is petitioner's opinion that unless the Tamils have a country of their own they will never be safe in Sri Lanka.  The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka prohibits any form of support for an independent Tamil state anywhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the petitioner's hearing came to a close, his parents, four sisters, and another brother, Ratnaeswaran, were living in Sri Lanka.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B) The Applicable Law</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. Sec. 1158(a) provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General shall establish a procedure for an alien physically present in the United States or at a land border or port of entry, irrespective of such alien's status, to apply for asylum, and the alien may be granted asylum in the discretion of the Attorney General if the Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent part of section 1101(a)(42)(A) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"refugee\" means (A) any person who is outside any country of such person's nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that in this case there is no claim of persecution of petitioner while he was living in Sri Lanka.  His asylum application states that he was never mistreated by Sri Lankan authorities.  The only question is whether petitioner has a well-founded fear of persecution if he is returned to Sri Lanka.  Petitioner has the burden of proof.   Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 758;  Alvarez-Flores v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 817 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find substantial evidence in the record to support the Board's conclusion that petitioner failed to prove the objective component of the standard:  \"that there was not a well-founded fear of persecution by the Sri Lankan authorities on any of the five grounds specified in the Act.\"  Because there is no question that Tamils, as well as other ethnic groups in Sri Lanka, have suffered onslaughts of violence engendered by ethnicity we turn to the case law for guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that acts of violence against a petitioner's friends or family members may establish a well-founded fear, notwithstanding an utter lack of persecution against the petitioner herself.  We have required, however, that this violence create a pattern of persecution closely tied to the petitioner.  Allegations of isolated violence are not enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arriaga-Barrientos v. I.N.S., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563859\"><a href=\"/opinion/563859/audelio-arriaga-barrientos-v-us-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 414 (9th Cir. 1991) (citations omitted).  The authorities were interested in petitioner's brother, Ganeswaran, not petitioner, and it was Ganeswaran who was assaulted and arrested by the police.  Petitioner was in the United States when his brother Rajeswaran was arrested and beaten.  We think it significant that petitioner was able, by telephone, to obtain the release of his brother from jail and arrange for Rajeswaran to go back to work in Saudi Arabia.  We cannot ignore the fact that petitioner's parents, four sisters, and a brother continue to live in Sri Lanka.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we pointed out in  Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 759:  \"Generally, evidence of widespread violence and human rights violations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish persecution.\"  Ravindran is a case practically on all fours with this one.  It involved a Tamil petitioner claiming a well- founded fear of persecution if he were deported.  The decision in Ravindran is, therefore, binding on us.  Petitioner does not refer to Ravindran at all in his brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that the political opinions, goals and methods of the Tamil Tigers have been imputed to the petitioner by the Sri Lankan authorities.  Nor is there evidence that the Sri Lankan authorities know of petitioner's membership in the Tamil Eelam Association.  But even assuming that they do know, there is no evidence that membership on the Tamil Eelam would result in persecution.  The Tamil Eelam supports the peace pact between Sri Lanka and India.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any evidence that petitioner's advocacy of an independent Tamil state will result in his persecution because it may have violated the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka.  Petitioner's advocacy of an independent Tamil state took place in the United States.  There is no evidence that the authorities in Sri Lanka are aware of petitioner's views.  There is nothing in the record suggesting that Sri Lankan authorities have persecuted Tamils for opinions expressed in another country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is in the record a letter from the State Department to the Immigration Examiner containing a copy of the January 1984 State Department Report on Human Rights Practices in Sri Lanka for the calendar year 1983 which gives a different perspective on the situation in Sri Lanka.  A portion of the report states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, and as explained in greater detail in the enclosed human rights report, there is distrust and animosity between Tamils and the majority Sinhalese of Sri Lanka.  Communal tensions led in mid-1983 to the worst outbreak of violence and lawlessness to have occurred in Sri Lanka in recent history.  In a week of rioting, several hundred people were killed and thousands lost their homes.  The Government restored order in early August and has succeeded in maintaining the peace since then, but tensions remain.  Many of the Tamils affected by the violence suffered great personal and property losses, and some fear there will be a recurrence of violence.  But any threat against the peace and well-being of Tamils, and of all Sri Lankans, arises from tensions in society, and not from a policy of the Government to persecute or to allow the persecution of Tamils or any other group.  The leaders of the Government, who include Tamils, strive to protect all Sri Lankans.  Illegal discrimination against Tamils does not occur with the sanction of the Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether petitioner will suffer violence on his return to Sri Lanka, we do not know.  We do know, however, that there is no principled basis for overturning the Board's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
