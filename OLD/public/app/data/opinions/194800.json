The plaintiff-appellant, Robert King,  has\n               \n\nappealed a judgment in defendants-appellees'  favor, claiming\n\nerror in jury instructions  given and not given and  error in\n\nthe formulation of special jury questions.  Despite the court\n\nrules,  see, e.g.,  Fed. R.  App. P.  10(b), setting  out the\n                 \n\nappellant's  obligation   to  provide   this  court   with  a\n\nsufficient  supporting record, this court's extensive caselaw\n\nin  this  regard, see,  e.g.,  Valedon  Martinez v.

Indeed, he\n\nhas  even  expressly decried  the  necessity  of providing  a\n\ntranscript in this case.\n\n     \"We have held repeatedly that we will not review a claim\n\nof  error if the appellant has failed to include a transcript\n\nof the pertinent proceedings  in the record on appeal.\"   Id.\n                                                             \n\n(citing our caselaw).  We  are unable meaningfully to  review\n\nappellant's claims  because, as in Valedon  Martinez, \"in the\n                                                    \n\nabsence  of a transcript we simply are unable to evaluate the\n\nadequacy of the district  court's instruction or to determine\n\nwhether appellant  interposed a proper  objection.\"  Id.   So\n                                                        \n\ntoo,  we  are  unable  to  determine  whether  the  appellant\n\nproperly raised  and preserved issues as  to instructions not\n\ngiven  or  to  preferred  formulations of  the  special  jury\n\nquestions.   The  appellant's  brief, in  fact, is  strangely\n\nsilent as to whether he raised any objections.  \"No party may\n\nassign  as error  the  giving  or  the  failure  to  give  an\n\ninstruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury\n\nretires to  consider  its  verdict,  stating  distinctly  the\n\nmatter objected to and  the grounds of the objection.\"   Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P.  51.  We  have required  \"firm adherence\" to  this\n\nrule.  Transnational Corp. v. Rodio &amp; Ursillo, Ltd., 920 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1066, 1069 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n     On   occasion,  despite  the   absence  of   a  relevant\n\ntranscript, we  have considered an appellant's  claims to the\n\nextent  possible on the limited record before us.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nValedon Martinez v. Hospital Presbiteriano, 806 F.2d at 1135.\n                                          \n\nIn  this   case,  our  review  finds   appellant's  arguments\n\ndeficient and without hint of possible merit.\n\n     Appellant complains that  his breach  of contract  claim\n\nwas not heard  by the jury.1   This complaint is  puzzling as\n\nthe first special question presented to the jury was:\n\n          Was there  in 1990  an  agreement for  an\n          exclusive     distributorship     between\n          plaintiff,  Robert  King  and  defendant,\n          Martin Feed Mills, Ltd.?\n\n                    \n\n1.  Appellant also complains that the jury was not allowed to\nhear  testimony from his  alleged experts on  the question of\ndamages for breach of  contract.  The clerk's notes  from the\ntrial indicate that one of these witnesses testified and that\nthe testimony of  the second  witness was excluded.   In  the\nabsence   of  a   transcript,  we   can  derive   no  further\nenlightening  information.   At  any rate,  the exclusion  of\nevidence  on damages in harmless where, as here, the judgment\non liability in defendants' favor must stand.\n\n                             -3-\n\nThe jury  answered \"No,\" suggesting that  the jury considered\n\nthe issue  of the existence of  a contract and  found that no\n\ncontract existed.\n\n     Insofar  as appellant's complaint may be directed toward\n\nthe issue of  improper termination, this issue  was not heard\n\nby the  jury because the  district court  directed a  verdict\n\nagainst  him.     Yet,   appellant's  brief  does   not  even\n\nacknowledge  the  directed verdict,  much  less  set out  the\n\nstandard  of review.  On  appeal from a  directed verdict, we\n\nlook  at  the evidence  in the  light  most favorable  to the\n\nlosing party  and determine  whether a reasonable  jury could\n\nonly have  reached the  same conclusion  as the  trial court.\n\nNewharbor  Partners, Inc. v. F.D. Rich Co., 961 F.2d 294, 298\n                                          \n\n(1st  Cir. 1992).  A party challenging a directed verdict may\n\nnot  rest on  conjecture  or speculation,  but  must rely  on\n\nevidence which consists of \"'more than  fragmentary tendrils:\n\na mere scintilla  of evidence  is not enough  to forestall  a\n\ndirected  verdict,' especially  on an  issue as to  which the\n\nburden of proof  belongs to  the appellant.\"   Id.  (citation\n                                                  \n\nomitted).  Appellant cannot  succeed in convincing this court\n\nthat the district court  erred in taking this issue  from the\n\njury without  providing us with the evidence  which he claims\n\nsuffices  to  merit  jury  review.    And,  of  course,  that\n\nevidence,  if it  existed,  would, of  necessity, lie  in the\n\ntrial transcript.\n\n                             -4-\n\n     Appellant  also  contends  that  it was  error  for  the\n\ndistrict  court judge to have \"instructed the jury that there\n\nwas a Counterclaim  and she requested that  the jury consider\n\nthis Counterclaim against  the plaintiff.\"   Appellant argues\n\nthat the  defendants did  not file  any counterclaim  with or\n\nsubsequent to their answer.  This is of no moment.\n\n          When issues not  raised by the  pleadings\n          are tried  by express or  implied consent\n          of the parties, they shall  be treated in\n          all respects  as if they have been raised\n          in the pleadings.  Such amendment  of the\n          pleadings  as may  be necessary  to cause\n          them to  conform to the  evidence and  to\n          raise  these  issues  may  be  made  upon\n          motion of  any party  at  any time,  even\n          after judgment; but  failure so to  amend\n          does not affect the  result of the  trial\n          of these issues.\n\nFed.  R.  Civ. P.  15(b).   The  record contains  the court s\n\nscheduling  order of July 14, 1992, and its pretrial order of\n\nNovember  17, 1992,  in which  the parties   agreed-to issues\n                                                             \n\nincluded:\n\n          Whether  defendant  improperly terminated\n          the distributorship  or whether plaintiff\n                                                   \n          had  before  the   date  of   termination\n                                                   \n          breached  the agreement by failing to pay\n                                                   \n          his debts to defendant?\n                                \n\nIt  is   evident  that  the   defendants'  counterclaim   for\n\nnonpayment  of   debts  was  properly  part   of  this  case.\n\nMoreover,  in  any  event,  the  record  indicates  that  the\n\ndistrict court directed  a verdict for  the appellant on  the\n\ncounterclaim.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     In sum, the  defendants' request for summary  affirmance\n\nis well warranted.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

This is of no moment.\n\n          When issues not  raised by the  pleadings\n          are tried  by express or  implied consent\n          of the parties, they shall  be treated in\n          all respects  as if they have been raised\n          in the pleadings.  Such amendment  of the\n          pleadings  as may  be necessary  to cause\n          them to  conform to the  evidence and  to\n          raise  these  issues  may  be  made  upon\n          motion of  any party  at  any time,  even\n          after judgment; but  failure so to  amend\n          does not affect the  result of the  trial\n          of these issues.\n\nFed.  R.  Civ. P.  15(b).   The  record contains  the court s\n\nscheduling  order of July 14, 1992, and its pretrial order of\n\nNovember  17, 1992,  in which  the parties   agreed-to issues\n                                                             \n\nincluded:\n\n          Whether  defendant  improperly terminated\n          the distributorship  or whether plaintiff\n                                                   \n          had  before  the   date  of   termination\n                                                   \n          breached  the agreement by failing to pay\n                                                   \n          his debts to defendant?\n                                \n\nIt  is   evident  that  the   defendants'  counterclaim   for\n\nnonpayment  of   debts  was  properly  part   of  this  case.\n\nMoreover,  in  any  event,  the  record  indicates  that  the\n\ndistrict court directed  a verdict for  the appellant on  the\n\ncounterclaim.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     In sum, the  defendants' request for summary  affirmance\n\nis well warranted.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Loc. R.\n                                                    \n\n27.1.\n\n     We award double costs to the defendants-appellees.  Fed.\n                          \n\nR.
