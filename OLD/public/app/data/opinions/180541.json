Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Boudin and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     J. Martin Richey, Federal Defender Office, for appellant.\n     Nina Goodman, Appellate Section, Criminal Division, Department\nof Justice, with whom Lanny A. Breuer, Assistant Attorney General,\nGreg D. Andres, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and\nCarmen Milagros Ortiz, United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         December 7, 2010\n\f          BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.      A jury found Winston McGhee\n\nguilty of possession of cocaine base (at least five grams), 21\n\nU.S.C. § 844(a) (2006), and of possession of cocaine base with\n\nintent to distribute (less than five grams), id. § 841(a)(1).1   He\n\nnow appeals on three grounds:      that the search of his person\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment; that the court impermissibly allowed\n\na testifying chemist to rely in part on another chemist's test\n\nresults as to one drug sample (the sale of which was not charged);\n\nand that at sentencing, a youthful offender adjudication was\n\nimproperly treated as a career offender predicate.\n\n          During June and July 2006, Jeffrey Stone (a sergeant in\n\nthe Massachusetts State Police) and Nicholas Curelli (a detective\n\nin the Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, Police Department) investigated\n\nreports of cocaine sales by Jordan Clements, her boyfriend Calvin,\n\nand his friend called \"Pooh.\" On July 10, a confidential informant\n\nmade a controlled purchase of a sample from Pooh, which Stone\n\nobserved before following Pooh back to the Nashua House hotel. The\n\nsample was contained in a corner of a plastic bag that had been\n\ntwisted and cut off from the original bag.   The officers concluded\n\nfrom appearance and a field test that the sample was crack cocaine,\n\n\n     1\n      After McGhee's trial and sentence, both § 841 and § 844 were\namended by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-220,\n124 Stat. 2372, which increased from five grams to twenty-eight\ngrams the amount of cocaine base distribution triggering the\nstatutory sentencing range of five to forty years and which removed\na five-to-twenty-year range for possession of more than five grams\nof cocaine base. Id. §§ 2(a)(2), 3, 124 Stat. at 2372.\n\n                                -2-\n\fand a Nashua House employee informed Curelli that Clements and two\n\nmen were staying in Room 6 of the hotel.\n\n          Based on this evidence, the officers obtained a warrant\n\npermitting them to search for cocaine and records, money, or\n\nparaphernalia related to illegal drug possession in Room 6 and on\n\nthe person or in the possession of Clements, Calvin, and Pooh.\n\nThat evening, the officers stopped McGhee as he entered the hotel--\n\nhe denied using the name Pooh and identified himself as Winston\n\nMcGhee--and in a pat down took from him a knife.    McGhee walked up\n\nto Room 6 with the officers, and Curelli began to search him while\n\nStone searched the room.\n\n          There, the officers found fifteen corners and seventeen\n\nknotted ends of plastic sandwich bags, a cell phone, and two\n\nreceipts--one for the room registration in Clements' name and one\n\ndated that day for a bicycle in McGhee's name; they found no\n\ncocaine and no apparatus for smoking crack.      In McGhee's pockets\n\nand wallet, Curelli found identification with McGhee's name and\n\n$1,229 in cash--although McGhee was unemployed at the time--and\n\nanother cell phone that displayed the name \"Pooh.\"      The officer\n\nfound marijuana in McGhee's shoes and arrested him.\n\n          Around this time, two more male officers--McSweeney and\n\nMarquis--joined Stone and Curelli in the room.    Curelli had McGhee\n\nremove his polo shirt and blue jean shorts, leaving him in his\n\nunderwear (an A-shirt and basketball shorts) and revealing a brand\n\n\n                               -3-\n\for scar of \"Pooh\" on his arm.         Stone then instructed Curelli to\n\ncomplete his search.\n\n           McGhee began to protest, saying that they could not\n\nsearch him or \"stick a finger up [his] ass.\"             Stone replied that\n\nthey would not do that, but they would \"do a complete search.\"\n\nMcGhee   refused   and   then     physically   resisted    removal     of   his\n\nunderwear; against resistance, the officers forced McGhee to the\n\nfloor, pulled down his shorts, and found a bag protruding from\n\nbetween McGhee's buttocks, which McSweeney picked up.                  The bag\n\ncontained thirty-one individual baggies of what, when later tested,\n\nproved to be cocaine base.\n\n           McGhee was indicted for possession of cocaine base and\n\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine base; the grand jury\n\nalleged in both counts that the offense involved at least five\n\ngrams of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine\n\nbase. Prior to trial, McGhee moved to suppress the seized evidence\n\nbut his motion was denied.        At his trial the officers testified to\n\nthe events set forth above including the original sample purchased\n\nby the informant, the searches of the room and of McGhee and the\n\nevidence   obtained   in   both    searches.     There    was   also    expert\n\ntestimony from a chemist that the drugs in the baggies were cocaine\n\nbase and totaled 7.88 grams and that the sample was also cocaine\n\nbase and weighed 0.49 grams.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             The jury found McGhee guilty of both counts; in answers\n\nto special interrogatories, the jury stated that the substance in\n\nboth counts was cocaine base, but that the five-gram minimum was\n\nonly shown for the possession count.              The separate inquiry was\n\npertinent    because,    among    other      things,   the   five-gram     figure\n\naffected the statutory sentencing range then in force.                  21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(b)(1)(B)(iii), 844(a).          At sentencing, the district court\n\nruled over objection that McGhee qualified as a career offender,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 (2008), leading to a guideline range of 210 to 262\n\nmonths' imprisonment, but the district court granted a downward\n\nvariance and sentenced McGhee to 96 months' imprisonment.                 McGhee\n\nnow appeals.\n\n             We begin with McGhee's claim that the district court\n\nshould have suppressed the package of thirty-one baggies.                 Police\n\nsearches are constrained by the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness\n\nrequirement     and,    in   certain    circumstances,       by   the     further\n\nrequirement of a warrant.        E.g., Arizona v. Gant, 129 S. Ct. 1710,\n\n1716 (2009); 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 1.1(a), at 8 (4th\n\ned. 2004).    McGhee does not argue that a warrant was needed if the\n\nrequisite grounds existed for so intrusive a search incident to an\n\narrest.     Conversely the government chose not to assert that the\n\nwarrant separately authorized a search that included removal of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fMcGhee's clothes,2 but defends the search as reasonable incident to\n\nthe arrest.\n\n           McGhee had been validly arrested on a drug offense at the\n\ntime of the search and, although McGhee was formally arrested only\n\nfor marijuana possession, there was probable cause to believe that\n\nhe was a drug trafficker since he had sold a drug sample earlier in\n\nthe day.   In an ordinary arrest, a \"full search of the person\" is\n\na conventional means of protecting the arresting officers from\n\nweapons and assuring against the destruction of evidence.    United\n\nStates v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235 (1973); see also Chimel v.\n\nCalifornia, 395 U.S. 752, 762-63 (1969).\n\n           But, as a search extends beyond a pat down and the\n\nremoval of outer garments, shoes and socks, the case law has\n\nrequired increasing justification for more intrusive measures, see,\n\ne.g., Swain, 117 F.3d at 5-6; our decisions, although sometimes\n\nvarying in labels, tend to distinguish between (1) a simple strip\n\nsearch involving removal of all or virtually all clothes, (2) a\n\nvisual inspection of genitals or buttocks requiring some change in\n\nposture of the body (for example, the subject might be forced to\n\n\n\n     2\n      The warrant authorized a search for cocaine and related\nevidence on the person or in the possession of Pooh, and it\nincorporated an affidavit stating \"that people who use, possess and\nsell drugs will often conceal drugs on their body.\" Cf. Doe v.\nGroody, 361 F.3d 232, 239-40 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 873\n(2004); United States v. Husband, 226 F.3d 626, 638-39 (7th Cir.\n2000) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting); United States v. Nelson, 36\nF.3d 758, 760 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\n                                -6-\n\fbend over and spread his buttock cheeks), and (3) an actual manual\n\nintrusion into such orifices.           E.g., Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d\n\n556, 561 n.3 (1st Cir. 1985); see also United States v. Barnes, 506\n\nF.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 2007).3\n\n            In this case, the district court found that McGhee was\n\nsubject on arrest only to the first of these three additional\n\nmeasures,   using   the    term      \"strip   search\"    to   exclude   the   more\n\nintrusive visual body cavity search. McGhee rather briefly asserts\n\nthat in fact what occurred here was a visual body cavity search.\n\nThe   district   court    may   be    entitled   to     different   measures   of\n\ndeference depending upon whether the focus is upon characterization\n\nof evidence or its findings of raw facts, compare Ornelas v. United\n\nStates, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996), with United States v. Bater, 594\n\nF.3d 51, 55 (1st Cir. 2010), but regardless, the record evidence\n\nconfirms the district court's conclusion.\n\n            Thus, McGhee argues that while a strip search involves a\n\nview of the naked body in a natural posture, the district court\n\nfound that the officers had held McGhee down and pulled his ankles\n\napart, revealing \"what was hidden in between the cheeks of his\n\nbuttocks.\" But the description is incomplete and the word \"hidden\"\n\n\n      3\n      Further, a search on arrest may be assessed differently than\nsearches in other circumstances. McGhee's situation thus differs\nfrom a search of pretrial detainees, for which security interests\nof detention facilities may add justification, see Bell v. Wolfish,\n441 U.S. 520, 559-60 (1979), or a search conducted long enough\nafter arrest that the exigent threat of destruction of evidence has\nfaded, see Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                        -7-\n\fis inaccurate.   The record shows that, far from submitting to the\n\nrequest to strip, McGhee deliberately swung his body into the\n\nofficers, and the district court found that he made a non-forcible\n\nstrip search impossible \"by clenching his buttocks, by tangling his\n\nankles, by refusing to get up, by resisting in a variety of\n\ndifferent ways.\"\n\n          The officers, as the district court ruled, did \"no more\n\nthan was necessary to obtain a full strip search\"; the \"spreading\"\n\nof McGhee's legs was only \"in the sense that [an officer] untangled\n\n[McGhee's deliberately entangled] ankles\" and, at that point, the\n\nofficers \"observed . . . in plain view, protruding from Mr.\n\nMcGhee's buttocks,\" the package containing the thirty-one baggies\n\nof cocaine.   In fact, the back of McGhee's undershorts were pulled\n\ndown only enough to expose his buttocks, so the legs, being bound\n\nby the garment, probably could not readily have been pulled far\n\napart into some unnatural posture.\n\n          The question remains whether the officers had whatever\n\nenhanced grounds may be needed to justify any strip search at all.\n\nHere, the government cites our statement in Barnes that \"[t]he\n\ninitial strip search [of the defendant] for contraband and weapons\n\nwas clearly justified given Barnes's arrest for a drug trafficking\n\ncrime,\" 506 F.3d at 62; Barnes then went on to assess a more\n\nintrusive body cavity inspection (a bend-over-and-spread-your-\n\ncheeks direction) based on a tip that the defendant regularly\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fconcealed drugs between his buttocks, id. at 60-65.             The quoted\n\nstatement in Barnes, says the government, lays down a general rule\n\nthat justifies a strip search of any drug-trafficking arrestee.\n\n          McGhee responds that categorical rules are always to be\n\nrejected in the Fourth Amendment context and that everything must\n\nturn on evaluating the specific facts.         Yet generalizations lie\n\nbehind every such evaluation, Tardiff v. Knox Cnty., 365 F.3d 1, 5\n\nn.6 (1st Cir. 2004):      the question is whether a generalization is\n\npowerful enough to become a rule of thumb or something stronger.\n\nOver-generalization risks error; the absence of rules invites\n\nendless reinvention and inconsistent outcomes. There are plenty of\n\nrules and rules of thumb in the Fourth Amendment cases,4 whether\n\nBarnes were read as a rule, a presumption or something less.\n\n          However, McGhee says that the quoted language in Barnes\n\nis only a dictum because, in the end, that decision focused on a\n\nmore intrusive body cavity search and upheld it in light of the\n\nparticular   facts   in   that   case   including   the   tip   as   to   the\n\ndefendant's own past practice.      But whether the statement was pure\n\ndictum or played a role in the decision's reasoning, the Barnes\n\ncourt fairly viewed drug trafficking as linked to concealment of\n\n\n\n     4\n      See, e.g., Samson v. California, 547 U.S. 843, 857 (2006)\n(statutory suspicionless searches of parolees); United States v.\nVillamonte-Marquez,   462   U.S.   579,   580-81,   592-93   (1983)\n(suspicionless boarding of vessels for inspection of documents);\nHenry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 100 (1959) (warrantless arrest\nfor felonies committed in officer's presence).\n\n                                   -9-\n\fdrugs; and Barnes made clear, in what is more than dictum, that an\n\nintrusive search of a validly arrested person (whether a strip\n\nsearch or a visual body cavity search) requires only a reasonable\n\nbasis for supposing that the particular kind of search employed\n\nmight be fruitful.        506 F.3d at 62-63.\n\n           Here, it is enough that the officers had ample reason to\n\nsuspect that McGhee might well be concealing drugs about his person\n\nand not just in his pockets.            Marijuana had already been found\n\nconcealed in his shoes; and, when one officer told him without\n\nbeing more specific that the team was about to complete the search,\n\nMcGhee began to protest, saying that they could not \"stick a finger\n\nup [his] ass.\"        Although reassured that this was not going to\n\noccur, McGhee physically resisted removing his shorts; his pattern\n\nof   behavior   was   a    reasonable    signal    that   drugs   were   likely\n\nconcealed within.         On its own facts, the search was lawful and\n\nsuppression properly denied.\n\n           McGhee's second claim concerns the testimony given at\n\ntrial to establish the nature and weight of the drugs.               Caroline\n\nTatro, a chemist at the Massachusetts State Police Crime Laboratory\n\nwho had analyzed the thirty-one baggies, testified that they\n\ncontained 7.88 grams of cocaine base.             It was these baggies that\n\nwere the subjects of both counts of the indictment, one of which\n\ncharged intent to distribute and the other mere possession.               There\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fis no challenge to Tatro's testimony about the weight or substance\n\ncontained in these baggies.\n\n              However, Tatro also testified that the sample McGhee had\n\nsupplied the informant earlier in the day comprised 0.49 grams of\n\ncocaine base.       Although McGhee was not charged in the indictment\n\nwith possession or distribution of this sample, the evidence of the\n\nearlier sale was offered by the government to confirm that McGhee\n\nwas a drug trafficker and so to support the inference that the\n\nthirty-one baggies–or some portion of them--were also intended for\n\ndistribution.      There was other evidence of intended distribution,\n\nto which we will return; but the distributed sample was evidence\n\noffered to confirm McGhee's intent as to the thirty-one baggies.\n\n              However, a different chemist, Hannah Knowles, had tested\n\nthe sample, and Knowles did not testify nor were her records\n\noffered in evidence.       Instead Tatro rendered an opinion as to both\n\nthe nature and weight of the sample based on Knowles' case file and\n\ntest results recorded in the file.             McGhee made unsuccessfully at\n\ntrial,    and    now   renews   on   appeal,    the   objection   that   Tatro's\n\ntestimony as to the sample was barred by the Confrontation Clause\n\nof the Constitution as construed in Crawford v. Washington, 541\n\nU.S.     36     (2004),   and    more    recently      in   Melendez-Diaz    v.\n\nMassachusetts, 129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009).\n\n              Both cases dealt with out-of-court statements, other than\n\nadmissions, offered in criminal trials against the defendant;\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fprior Supreme Court precedent had held such statements to be\n\nconstitutional if they fell within traditional hearsay exceptions\n\nor were otherwise reliable.             Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 65-66\n\n(1980).        In    Crawford,    the    Supreme      Court   established     as   a\n\nconstitutional rule that where the out-of-court statements were\n\n\"testimonial,\" the sine qua non of admissibility was a prior\n\nopportunity by the defendant to cross examine the out-of-court\n\n\"witness\" and the unavailability of that witness as well, 541 U.S.\n\nat 53-54, 68.\n\n             Then, in Melendez-Diaz, a sharply divided Court applied\n\nthe Crawford ban to a lab technician's certification that cocaine\n\nseized by the police was of a certain quality and quantity, 129 S.\n\nCt. at 2532.         This overturned the common practice in many state\n\ncourts of using such certificates in drug and other prosecutions.\n\nId. at 2543 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).                 The Supreme Court's new\n\nslant   on     the   Confrontation      Clause   is    likely   to    be   contested\n\nterritory for some years, although the recent grant of certiorari\n\nin State v. Bullcoming, 226 P.3d 1 (N.M. 2010), cert. granted, 79\n\nU.S.L.W. 3194 (U.S. Sept. 28, 2010) (No. 09-10876), may lead to\n\nsome clarification.\n\n             In the meantime, McGhee relies heavily upon Melendez-\n\nDiaz, claiming that Tatro's testimony simply channeled Knowles'\n\nreport.      This case can doubtless be distinguished from Melendez-\n\nDiaz:     in    particular,      Knowles'   report      was   not    introduced    in\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fevidence, nor did Tatro's testimony comprise a direct recitation of\n\nthat report, as in Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 826 (2006).\n\nThe problem is further complicated because Justice Thomas, who made\n\nup the needed fifth vote in Melendez-Diaz, 129 S. Ct. at 2543\n\n(Thomas,         J.,     concurring),    had    a   narrower     interpretation    of\n\nCrawford,         and    it   is   unclear   whether     he   would   regard   Tatro's\n\ntestimony, relying only in part on Knowles' work, as amounting to\n\na forbidden introduction of Knowles' own report, even assuming that\n\nhe regarded the latter as a \"testimonial statement\" subject to\n\nCrawford.\n\n                 What may matter even more is that Tatro's testimony that\n\nthe sample was cocaine base did not rest on Knowles' conclusion\n\nalone.          Knowles' report furnished technical test data, which in\n\nsome measure permitted Tatro to draw her own scientific conclusion\n\nas to the nature of the sample; Tatro, who worked in the same lab,\n\nunderstood the testing methodologies and protocols used by Knowles.\n\nExperts who testify regularly in court commonly and permissibly\n\nrely in some measure on information gathered by other experts.\n\nFed.

The quality and\n\nquantity of dependence is going to vary from case to case and,\n\nabsent clarification by the Court, how Rule 703 and Melendez-Diaz\n\nare to be reconciled may, in some cases, involve case-by-case\n\nassessments.   However, the issue needs no further discussion here\n\nfor even if we assume arguendo that Melendez-Diaz barred Tatro's\n\ntestimony as to the identity of the sample, the error was patently\n\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.           As for the weight of the\n\nsample--where Tatro's testimony did depend entirely on Knowles'\n\nweighing and was likely inadmissible, see Mirabal, 2010 WL 3834072,\n\nat *7-*8--that evidence was virtually irrelevant.\n\n          Officer testimony, essentially uncontradicted, showed\n\nthat McGhee had sold a sample during the controlled drug buy; and\n\nofficers testified that, by field test and observation, the sample\n\nwas a small amount of cocaine.             Thus, the officer testimony\n\nprovided a basis for the jury to conclude without regard to Tatro's\n\ntestimony that the sample was cocaine; further, in making the sale,\n\nMcGhee appeared to be holding himself out as a drug dealer.           Both\n\nfacts--the   cocaine   sale   and   the    holding   out--were   themselves\n\nrelevant only for an inference that at least some of the thirty-one\n\n\n\n\nUnited States v. Darden, 656 F. Supp. 2d 560 (D. Md. 2009); Larkin\nv. Yates, No. CV 09-2034-DSF (CT), 2009 WL 2049991, at *1 (C.D.\nCal. July 9, 2009).\n\n                                    -14-\n\fbaggies that McGhee had secreted on his body were also intended for\n\nsale.\n\n            That intention, however, was independently established by\n\nthe empty bag ends in the hotel room, by the multiple cell phones,\n\nby McGhee's possession (while unemployed) of a large cache of\n\nbills, and by the large quantity of cocaine in the thirty-one\n\nbaggies. The jurors also had Officer Stone's testimony that a user\n\nof crack cocaine would normally have one or two packets of cocaine,\n\nnot thirty-one.    So it is hard to imagine that, even if the sample\n\nsale had been excluded in its entirety, a jury could have avoided\n\nconcluding that some portion of the thirty-one baggies was intended\n\nfor distribution.\n\n            Of course, how much of the cocaine in the thirty-one\n\nbaggies was intended for distribution was a disputed issue; at\n\nleast, given the verdict, the jurors were not able to agree that\n\nall of those baggies were intended for distribution rather than\n\nconsumption.6    Still, whether McGhee's prior (uncharged) sale was\n\nof   cocaine   added   almost   no   information   about   the   percentage\n\nintended for sale of the drugs actually seized on arrest.               The\n\nother evidence overwhelmingly established that McGhee held at least\n\n\n\n        6\n      Additionally, the jurors asked during deliberation, \"Can we\nagree on 1 count of the verdict (i.e. #1 or 2) and not on the\nother?\"    They also posed two questions about \"alternative\nexplanations\" and their effect on reasonable doubt, enquiring\nwhether an alternative explanation unsupported by evidence or\nunargued by the defense would constitute reasonable doubt.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fsome of the baggies for distribution; and intended distribution,\n\nwith no minimum amount, was all the jury found on that count.\n\n            McGhee's        third    and    final      claim      centers     upon   his\n\ndesignation      during     sentencing      as    a    career     offender.      Career\n\noffender status normally increases significantly the guideline\n\nrange assigned to a convicted defendant, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, the\n\nrange usually influencing in some measure the ultimate sentence,\n\nid. § 5; see United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245-46 (2005).\n\nCareer offenders must have committed \"at least two prior felony\n\nconvictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance\n\noffense,\" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a); at issue was whether McGhee's\n\nyouthful offender adjudication for armed robbery and assault with\n\na    dangerous     weapon    would     count      as   the   second     prior    felony\n\nconviction.\n\n            Initially, the district court considered certifying the\n\nquestion to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to determine\n\nwhether it would classify the offense as an adult conviction.                        See\n\nid. § 4B1.2 cmt. n.1.         However, United States v. Torres, 541 F.3d\n\n48   (1st   Cir.    2008),     cert.    denied,        129   S.   Ct.   1987    (2009),\n\nintervened; the district court held that it was directed by Torres\n\nto count the youthful offender adjudication as a prior felony\n\nconviction.      McGhee concedes in his appellate brief that Torres\n\ncontrols his case; he \"raises this challenge . . . in order to\n\npreserve the issue for further en banc review.\"\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\f          Ordinarily, with exceptions not applicable here, one\n\npanel in this circuit must follow a legal ruling by another panel,\n\nIrving v. United States, 162 F.3d 154, 160 (1st Cir. 1998) (en\n\nbanc), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 812 (1999); accordingly, we follow\n\nTorres and uphold the district court's sentencing decision, but\n\nMcGhee's opportunity to seek en banc reconsideration to challenge\n\nTorres is duly preserved.   Also preserved is his further argument,\n\nbased on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, that (if Torres were\n\noverturned) the resulting error in classifying him as a career\n\noffender would not be harmless as to him.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

Andres, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and\nCarmen Milagros Ortiz, United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         December 7, 2010\n\f          BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.      A jury found Winston McGhee\n\nguilty of possession of cocaine base (at least five grams), 21\n\nU.S.C. § 844(a) (2006), and of possession of cocaine base with\n\nintent to distribute (less than five grams), id. § 841(a)(1).1   He\n\nnow appeals on three grounds:      that the search of his person\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment; that the court impermissibly allowed\n\na testifying chemist to rely in part on another chemist's test\n\nresults as to one drug sample (the sale of which was not charged);\n\nand that at sentencing, a youthful offender adjudication was\n\nimproperly treated as a career offender predicate.\n\n          During June and July 2006, Jeffrey Stone (a sergeant in\n\nthe Massachusetts State Police) and Nicholas Curelli (a detective\n\nin the Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, Police Department) investigated\n\nreports of cocaine sales by Jordan Clements, her boyfriend Calvin,\n\nand his friend called \"Pooh.\" On July 10, a confidential informant\n\nmade a controlled purchase of a sample from Pooh, which Stone\n\nobserved before following Pooh back to the Nashua House hotel. The\n\nsample was contained in a corner of a plastic bag that had been\n\ntwisted and cut off from the original bag.   The officers concluded\n\nfrom appearance and a field test that the sample was crack cocaine,\n\n\n     1\n      After McGhee's trial and sentence, both § 841 and § 844 were\namended by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-220,\n124 Stat. 2372, which increased from five grams to twenty-eight\ngrams the amount of cocaine base distribution triggering the\nstatutory sentencing range of five to forty years and which removed\na five-to-twenty-year range for possession of more than five grams\nof cocaine base. Id. §§ 2(a)(2), 3, 124 Stat. at 2372.\n\n                                -2-\n\fand a Nashua House employee informed Curelli that Clements and two\n\nmen were staying in Room 6 of the hotel.\n\n          Based on this evidence, the officers obtained a warrant\n\npermitting them to search for cocaine and records, money, or\n\nparaphernalia related to illegal drug possession in Room 6 and on\n\nthe person or in the possession of Clements, Calvin, and Pooh.\n\nThat evening, the officers stopped McGhee as he entered the hotel--\n\nhe denied using the name Pooh and identified himself as Winston\n\nMcGhee--and in a pat down took from him a knife.    McGhee walked up\n\nto Room 6 with the officers, and Curelli began to search him while\n\nStone searched the room.\n\n          There, the officers found fifteen corners and seventeen\n\nknotted ends of plastic sandwich bags, a cell phone, and two\n\nreceipts--one for the room registration in Clements' name and one\n\ndated that day for a bicycle in McGhee's name; they found no\n\ncocaine and no apparatus for smoking crack.      In McGhee's pockets\n\nand wallet, Curelli found identification with McGhee's name and\n\n$1,229 in cash--although McGhee was unemployed at the time--and\n\nanother cell phone that displayed the name \"Pooh.\"      The officer\n\nfound marijuana in McGhee's shoes and arrested him.\n\n          Around this time, two more male officers--McSweeney and\n\nMarquis--joined Stone and Curelli in the room.    Curelli had McGhee\n\nremove his polo shirt and blue jean shorts, leaving him in his\n\nunderwear (an A-shirt and basketball shorts) and revealing a brand\n\n\n                               -3-\n\for scar of \"Pooh\" on his arm.         Stone then instructed Curelli to\n\ncomplete his search.\n\n           McGhee began to protest, saying that they could not\n\nsearch him or \"stick a finger up [his] ass.\"             Stone replied that\n\nthey would not do that, but they would \"do a complete search.\"\n\nMcGhee   refused   and   then     physically   resisted    removal     of   his\n\nunderwear; against resistance, the officers forced McGhee to the\n\nfloor, pulled down his shorts, and found a bag protruding from\n\nbetween McGhee's buttocks, which McSweeney picked up.                  The bag\n\ncontained thirty-one individual baggies of what, when later tested,\n\nproved to be cocaine base.\n\n           McGhee was indicted for possession of cocaine base and\n\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine base; the grand jury\n\nalleged in both counts that the offense involved at least five\n\ngrams of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine\n\nbase. Prior to trial, McGhee moved to suppress the seized evidence\n\nbut his motion was denied.        At his trial the officers testified to\n\nthe events set forth above including the original sample purchased\n\nby the informant, the searches of the room and of McGhee and the\n\nevidence   obtained   in   both    searches.     There    was   also    expert\n\ntestimony from a chemist that the drugs in the baggies were cocaine\n\nbase and totaled 7.88 grams and that the sample was also cocaine\n\nbase and weighed 0.49 grams.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             The jury found McGhee guilty of both counts; in answers\n\nto special interrogatories, the jury stated that the substance in\n\nboth counts was cocaine base, but that the five-gram minimum was\n\nonly shown for the possession count.              The separate inquiry was\n\npertinent    because,    among    other      things,   the   five-gram     figure\n\naffected the statutory sentencing range then in force.                  21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(b)(1)(B)(iii), 844(a).          At sentencing, the district court\n\nruled over objection that McGhee qualified as a career offender,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 (2008), leading to a guideline range of 210 to 262\n\nmonths' imprisonment, but the district court granted a downward\n\nvariance and sentenced McGhee to 96 months' imprisonment.                 McGhee\n\nnow appeals.\n\n             We begin with McGhee's claim that the district court\n\nshould have suppressed the package of thirty-one baggies.                 Police\n\nsearches are constrained by the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness\n\nrequirement     and,    in   certain    circumstances,       by   the     further\n\nrequirement of a warrant.        E.g., Arizona v. Gant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145887\"><a href=\"/opinion/145887/arizona-v-gant/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

McGhee does not argue that a warrant was needed if the\n\nrequisite grounds existed for so intrusive a search incident to an\n\narrest.     Conversely the government chose not to assert that the\n\nwarrant separately authorized a search that included removal of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fMcGhee's clothes,2 but defends the search as reasonable incident to\n\nthe arrest.\n\n           McGhee had been validly arrested on a drug offense at the\n\ntime of the search and, although McGhee was formally arrested only\n\nfor marijuana possession, there was probable cause to believe that\n\nhe was a drug trafficker since he had sold a drug sample earlier in\n\nthe day.   In an ordinary arrest, a \"full search of the person\" is\n\na conventional means of protecting the arresting officers from\n\nweapons and assuring against the destruction of evidence.

The record shows that, far from submitting to the\n\nrequest to strip, McGhee deliberately swung his body into the\n\nofficers, and the district court found that he made a non-forcible\n\nstrip search impossible \"by clenching his buttocks, by tangling his\n\nankles, by refusing to get up, by resisting in a variety of\n\ndifferent ways.\"\n\n          The officers, as the district court ruled, did \"no more\n\nthan was necessary to obtain a full strip search\"; the \"spreading\"\n\nof McGhee's legs was only \"in the sense that [an officer] untangled\n\n[McGhee's deliberately entangled] ankles\" and, at that point, the\n\nofficers \"observed . . . in plain view, protruding from Mr.\n\nMcGhee's buttocks,\" the package containing the thirty-one baggies\n\nof cocaine.   In fact, the back of McGhee's undershorts were pulled\n\ndown only enough to expose his buttocks, so the legs, being bound\n\nby the garment, probably could not readily have been pulled far\n\napart into some unnatural posture.\n\n          The question remains whether the officers had whatever\n\nenhanced grounds may be needed to justify any strip search at all.\n\nHere, the government cites our statement in Barnes that \"[t]he\n\ninitial strip search [of the defendant] for contraband and weapons\n\nwas clearly justified given Barnes's arrest for a drug trafficking\n\ncrime,\" 506 F.3d at 62; Barnes then went on to assess a more\n\nintrusive body cavity inspection (a bend-over-and-spread-your-\n\ncheeks direction) based on a tip that the defendant regularly\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fconcealed drugs between his buttocks, id. at 60-65.             The quoted\n\nstatement in Barnes, says the government, lays down a general rule\n\nthat justifies a strip search of any drug-trafficking arrestee.\n\n          McGhee responds that categorical rules are always to be\n\nrejected in the Fourth Amendment context and that everything must\n\nturn on evaluating the specific facts.         Yet generalizations lie\n\nbehind every such evaluation, Tardiff v.

Marijuana had already been found\n\nconcealed in his shoes; and, when one officer told him without\n\nbeing more specific that the team was about to complete the search,\n\nMcGhee began to protest, saying that they could not \"stick a finger\n\nup [his] ass.\"        Although reassured that this was not going to\n\noccur, McGhee physically resisted removing his shorts; his pattern\n\nof   behavior   was   a    reasonable    signal    that   drugs   were   likely\n\nconcealed within.         On its own facts, the search was lawful and\n\nsuppression properly denied.\n\n           McGhee's second claim concerns the testimony given at\n\ntrial to establish the nature and weight of the drugs.               Caroline\n\nTatro, a chemist at the Massachusetts State Police Crime Laboratory\n\nwho had analyzed the thirty-one baggies, testified that they\n\ncontained 7.88 grams of cocaine base.             It was these baggies that\n\nwere the subjects of both counts of the indictment, one of which\n\ncharged intent to distribute and the other mere possession.               There\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fis no challenge to Tatro's testimony about the weight or substance\n\ncontained in these baggies.\n\n              However, Tatro also testified that the sample McGhee had\n\nsupplied the informant earlier in the day comprised 0.49 grams of\n\ncocaine base.       Although McGhee was not charged in the indictment\n\nwith possession or distribution of this sample, the evidence of the\n\nearlier sale was offered by the government to confirm that McGhee\n\nwas a drug trafficker and so to support the inference that the\n\nthirty-one baggies–or some portion of them--were also intended for\n\ndistribution.      There was other evidence of intended distribution,\n\nto which we will return; but the distributed sample was evidence\n\noffered to confirm McGhee's intent as to the thirty-one baggies.\n\n              However, a different chemist, Hannah Knowles, had tested\n\nthe sample, and Knowles did not testify nor were her records\n\noffered in evidence.       Instead Tatro rendered an opinion as to both\n\nthe nature and weight of the sample based on Knowles' case file and\n\ntest results recorded in the file.             McGhee made unsuccessfully at\n\ntrial,    and    now   renews   on   appeal,    the   objection   that   Tatro's\n\ntestimony as to the sample was barred by the Confrontation Clause\n\nof the Constitution as construed in Crawford v.

In    Crawford,    the    Supreme      Court   established     as   a\n\nconstitutional rule that where the out-of-court statements were\n\n\"testimonial,\" the sine qua non of admissibility was a prior\n\nopportunity by the defendant to cross examine the out-of-court\n\n\"witness\" and the unavailability of that witness as well, 541 U.S.\n\nat 53-54, 68.\n\n             Then, in Melendez-Diaz, a sharply divided Court applied\n\nthe Crawford ban to a lab technician's certification that cocaine\n\nseized by the police was of a certain quality and quantity, 129 S.\n\nCt. at 2532.

This case can doubtless be distinguished from Melendez-\n\nDiaz:     in    particular,      Knowles'   report      was   not    introduced    in\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fevidence, nor did Tatro's testimony comprise a direct recitation of\n\nthat report, as in Davis v.

However, the issue needs no further discussion here\n\nfor even if we assume arguendo that Melendez-Diaz barred Tatro's\n\ntestimony as to the identity of the sample, the error was patently\n\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Thus, the officer testimony\n\nprovided a basis for the jury to conclude without regard to Tatro's\n\ntestimony that the sample was cocaine; further, in making the sale,\n\nMcGhee appeared to be holding himself out as a drug dealer.

The jurors also had Officer Stone's testimony that a user\n\nof crack cocaine would normally have one or two packets of cocaine,\n\nnot thirty-one.    So it is hard to imagine that, even if the sample\n\nsale had been excluded in its entirety, a jury could have avoided\n\nconcluding that some portion of the thirty-one baggies was intended\n\nfor distribution.\n\n            Of course, how much of the cocaine in the thirty-one\n\nbaggies was intended for distribution was a disputed issue; at\n\nleast, given the verdict, the jurors were not able to agree that\n\nall of those baggies were intended for distribution rather than\n\nconsumption.6    Still, whether McGhee's prior (uncharged) sale was\n\nof   cocaine   added   almost   no   information   about   the   percentage\n\nintended for sale of the drugs actually seized on arrest.               The\n\nother evidence overwhelmingly established that McGhee held at least\n\n\n\n        6\n      Additionally, the jurors asked during deliberation, \"Can we\nagree on 1 count of the verdict (i.e. #1 or 2) and not on the\nother?\"    They also posed two questions about \"alternative\nexplanations\" and their effect on reasonable doubt, enquiring\nwhether an alternative explanation unsupported by evidence or\nunargued by the defense would constitute reasonable doubt.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fsome of the baggies for distribution; and intended distribution,\n\nwith no minimum amount, was all the jury found on that count.\n\n            McGhee's        third    and    final      claim      centers     upon   his\n\ndesignation      during     sentencing      as    a    career     offender.
