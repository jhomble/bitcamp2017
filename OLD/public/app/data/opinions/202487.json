The amendments\ndo not in any way affect the substance of the opinion.\n\f            LIPEZ,     Circuit    Judge.      John    Hancock     Life    Insurance\n\nCompany    and   two   of   its   subsidiaries       (collectively       \"Hancock\")\n\ncontracted with Abbott Laboratories (\"Abbott\") to join in financing\n\nthe development of some pharmaceutical compounds.                   In exchange,\n\nAbbott promised to share with Hancock any profits the compounds\n\nwould generate.        It soon became apparent that a number of the\n\ncompounds had no good prospect of commercial success.                          Abbott\n\nscaled    back   and   delayed    its   planned      investment    in    the   joint\n\nproject.    Arguing that Abbott had failed to uphold its part of the\n\nbargain, Hancock stopped contributing funds altogether.                     Hancock\n\nthen sued for a declaratory judgment, asking the district court to\n\nrule that, under the contract between the parties, Abbott's delayed\n\ninvestment allowed Hancock to terminate its payments but retain its\n\nshare of any future profits.        Abbott countersued, arguing that the\n\ncontract explicitly allowed it to delay its contributions to the\n\nproject.    The parties consented to have the district court decide\n\nthe case on the papers submitted, and, on cross motions, the\n\ndistrict court entered judgment for Hancock.                    Abbott appeals,\n\nessentially arguing that the district court incorrectly construed\n\nthe contract.     We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n     We discuss the contract between Hancock and Abbott and then\n\ntheir course of dealings.         We leave some details for discussion in\n\nconnection with Abbott's appellate arguments.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fA.   The contract\n\n     In 1999, Hancock and Abbott began negotiating the joint\n\nventure at issue.   While the specifics evolved through 40 contract\n\ndrafts, the basics of the final agreement are relatively simple.\n\nAbbott and Hancock would select a \"basket\" of research compounds\n\nthat Abbott had identified as possible pharmaceutical products and\n\nthat Hancock thought were promising.     Hancock would contribute\n\nmultiple millions each year for four consecutive years towards the\n\ndevelopment of these compounds.   Abbott would spend at least 1.86\n\ntimes as much as Hancock over this initial period of development.\n\nThe parties would share any profits from the compounds for roughly\n\nfifteen years from the contract's inception, and Abbott would pay\n\nHancock set amounts when the joint project accomplished certain\n\ndevelopment or regulatory goals.     In short, Hancock agreed to\n\nprovide substantial start-up investment for the project, and Abbott\n\nagreed to match that investment.      Because Hancock would share\n\nprofits only for a set number of years, it stood to gain if the\n\ncompounds were developed quickly (and if they turned out to be\n\nuseful) and stood to lose if development were delayed (or if the\n\ncompounds were unsuccessful).\n\n     For our purposes, the final contract between the parties,\n\nwhich was signed on March 13, 2001, can be summarized.\n\n     ! The parties agreed to partner in the development\n     of a basket of     compounds, with each compound\n     thought to have a potential pharmaceutical use.\n\n\n                           -3-\n\f     ! Hancock agreed to reimburse multiple millions of\n     Abbott's spending on the joint project in four\n     multiple million dollar payments – one for each\n     year 2001 through 2004.\n\n     ! Abbott agreed to provide an additional annual\n     minimum contribution of un-reimbursed funds to the\n     project in each of the four years.\n\n     ! Abbott also agreed that its and Hancock's\n     combined spending on the project would be \"at\n     least\" the Aggregate Spending Target over the\n     \"Program Term,\" which the contract defined as \"a\n     period of four (4) consecutive Program Years.\"1 In\n     other words, by December 31, 2004, Abbott would\n     provide approximately two-thirds of the Aggregate\n     Spending Target to the project above and beyond the\n     one-third of the Aggregate Spending Target that\n     Hancock promised to contribute.\n\n     ! Abbott was \"permitted\" to \"change its funding\n     obligations [] only as follows\":\n\n          (a) If Abbott expended Hancock's yearly\n          contribution during a \"Program Year\" but did\n          not contribute its annual minimum contribution\n          of its own un-reimbursed funds, Abbott could\n          \"carryover\" its obligation to the following\n          year.     The balance of Abbott's yearly\n          obligation, termed the \"Annual Carryover\n          Amount,\" would be added to Abbott's minimum\n          contribution for the \"subsequent Program\n          Year.\"      If   Abbott   carried   over   its\n          contribution, Hancock's obligations for the\n          \"subsequent Program Year\" would be suspended\n          until Abbott spent the \"Annual Carryover\n          Amount.\"\n\n          (b) If Abbott did not spend the entire\n          Aggregate Spending Target \"during the Program\n          Term,\" it could \"carryover\" the balance to the\n          \"subsequent year commencing immediately after\n\n\n1\n  The contract defined a \"Program Year\" as a full calendar year\nbeginning on January 1 and ending on December 31, except that the\nfirst \"Program Year\" would be shortened to begin of the day the\ncontract was signed and to end on December 31, 2001.\n\n                          -4-\n\f            the end of the Program Term.\" If there was\n            such a carryover, the difference between the\n            Aggregate Spending Target and the amount\n            actually spent by the end of the \"Program\n            Term\" would be called the \"Aggregate Carryover\n            Amount.\"\n\n     ! Abbott would update Hancock at least yearly about\n     the project, providing an \"Annual Research Plan\"\n     with a budget for future spending.     Abbott would\n     also provide yearly \"Status Reports\" stating the\n     company's spending on the joint project so far.\n     Hancock's payments were due 30 days after receiving\n     these documents.\n\n     ! In certain enumerated circumstances, including if\n     Abbott \"does not demonstrate in its Annual Research\n     Plan its intent and reasonable expectation\" to\n     spend at least the Aggregate Spending Target in\n     joint funds on the project \"during the Program\n     Term,\"   Hancock's   funding    obligations   would\n     terminate but the rest of the contract (detailing\n     how the parties would share profits) would remain\n     in effect.\n\n     ! Even if one of the enumerated terminable events\n     came to pass and Hancock's payment obligations were\n     cancelled, Hancock would still have to pay its\n     contributions for the year in which the terminable\n     event took place.\n\nB.   The parties' dealings\n\n     2001\n\n     Abbott's first \"Annual Research Plan\" was appended to the\n\nfinal contract, which was executed on March 13, 2001.        It called\n\nfor total project spending almost double the Aggregate Spending\n\nTarget by the end of 2004.     Under this plan, Abbott would spend\n\nmany millions of dollars of its own funds, or roughly five times as\n\nmuch as Hancock, through the end of 2004.       During 2001, Abbott\n\ndecided to halt development of some compounds. In November, Abbott\n\n                                 -5-\n\fsent Hancock a document titled \"2002 Preliminary Annual Research\n\nPlan,\" which called for total spending of less than Abbott's first\n\nAnnual Research Plan but more than the Aggregate Spending Target\n\nthrough 2004. In December, Abbott sent the \"2001 Status Report\" on\n\nthe year's spending, revealing that spending on the project would\n\ntotal multiple millions less by year's end (compared to the amount\n\nthat had been planned). Abbott's cover letter for the \"2001 Status\n\nReport\" stated that Hancock's 2001 payment was due in 30 days, an\n\nindication that Abbott believed its contractual obligations for the\n\nyear had been satisfied.      This was so even though the only \"Annual\n\nResearch Plan\" Abbott had given Hancock was marked \"Preliminary.\"\n\nAbbott did not manifest any intention to send an update to the\n\n\"2002 Preliminary Annual Research Plan.\"         Apparently agreeing that\n\nthe \"Preliminary\" plan satisfied Abbott's reporting obligation for\n\n2001, and that Abbott's obligations for that year were complete,\n\nHancock timely provided its 2001 contribution of multiple millions.\n\n     2002\n\n     In   2002,   Abbott    decided   to    terminate   development   of   an\n\nadditional compound because the scientific results did not warrant\n\nfurther development.       Abbott also dramatically reduced efforts on\n\nsome other compounds.       As a result, less than two years into the\n\njoint project, Abbott was      pursuing a significantly smaller number\n\nof the    original basket of compounds with full effort.              Abbott\n\nsubmitted its \"2002 Status Report\" and the \"2003 Preliminary Annual\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fResearch Plan\" together on December 20, 2002.                The Status Report\n\nrevealed that 2002 spending on the project would be far less than\n\nthe \"2002 Preliminary Annual Research Plan\" had promised. The Plan\n\nstated that spending for 2003 would also be significantly less than\n\nAbbott had estimated the year before.                 The Plan, however, was\n\nsilent as to 2004.          Unlike the previous year's version, the Plan\n\ndivulged the company's planned spending only for the next year.\n\n(Abbott later explained that the 2004 numbers had not been listed\n\nin   the   \"2003   Preliminary      Annual     Research   Plan\"    because     of   a\n\ncomputer error.)       As it had the previous year, Abbott stated in a\n\ncover    letter,     also   sent   on    December   20,   that    Hancock's    2002\n\ncontribution was due in 30 days.                Again, Abbott manifested no\n\nintention to update its \"Preliminary\" report and gave no indication\n\nthat the document was not the planning statement required by the\n\ncontract.     Hancock timely provided its reimbursement of multiple\n\nmillions.2\n\n      2003\n\n      During further review of the \"2003 Preliminary Annual Research\n\nPlan,\"     Hancock    noticed      the   document's    failure     to   make    any\n\nprediction of spending in 2004, a lapse that the company appears to\n\nhave overlooked on its initial review.              During a September 9, 2003\n\nconference call, Hancock asked Abbott to supplement the plan with\n\n\n2\n The 30th day after December 20 was January 19, a Sunday. Hancock\ntendered its payment the next business day. Abbott accepted the\npayment without comment and agrees that it was timely.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fthe missing information.       Abbott's Controller then sent Hancock a\n\nletter, dated September 22, 2003, stating the following:\n\n      I went back to review the data and spend estimates\n      made about 1 year ago for 2003. On 8/26/02, the\n      estimated program spend for 2003 was at [more than\n      indicated in the 2003 Preliminary Annual Research\n      Plan].   By October 14, 2002, after the Executive\n      Committee's portfolio review, the estimated spend\n      for 2003 had dropped to [approximately the same\n      amount as in the 2003 Preliminary Annual Research\n      Plan] and for 2004, it was at [an amount that when\n      added to the spending for 2001, 2002 and 2003 was\n      less than the Aggregate Spending Target].\n\nThis was an important admission.            Abbott confirmed that if there\n\nhad   been   no   computer   error   and    the   \"2003    Preliminary   Annual\n\nResearch Report\" had included planned spending for 2004, it would\n\nhave shown that Abbott planned to spend only an amount less than\n\npreviously projected, which would mean that spending through the\n\nend of 2004 would total -- at the most -- an amount less than the\n\nAggregate    Spending   Target.       The    earlier      status   reports   had\n\nindicated that Abbott's spending for 2001 and 2002 would be higher.\n\nIn its October 2002 reviews, Abbott had projected higher spending\n\nfor 2003 and for 2004.\n\n      To the same September 22, 2003 letter, Abbott attached a\n\ndocument it called \"the Final 2003 Plan.\"          This version of the 2003\n\nplan indicated that Abbott's spending during the Program Term would\n\nbe even lower than it had projected in October 2002.                     Abbott\n\nforecasted total spending of less than the Aggregate Spending\n\nTarget through 2004 and an additional amount in 2005.               Under this\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fprojection, total spending through 2004 would fall many millions\n\nshort of the Aggregate Spending Target.                    However, Abbott would\n\nexceed the threshold if 2005 spending were included.\n\n     After reviewing the updated 2003 plan, Hancock sent Abbott a\n\nletter, dated October 10, stating that its \"obligation to make any\n\nremaining   Program    Payments       to    Abbott   for    [2003   and    2004]   is\n\nterminated\" because \"the Final 2003 Plan, in conjunction with the\n\nmore limited information contained in the Preliminary 2003 Annual\n\nResearch Plan . . . did not, and does not, reasonably demonstrate\n\nAbbott's intent and reasonable expectation to\" spend the Aggregate\n\nSpending Target on the joint project \"during the Program Term.\"\n\n     Shortly thereafter, Abbott sent Hancock a \"2004 Preliminary\n\nAnnual Research Plan,\" which projected total project spending                      for\n\n2004 and 2005.     Cumulative spending on the project would be less\n\nthan the Aggregate Spending Target through 2004 and more than the\n\nAggregate   Spending      Target   through       2005.       The    same   document\n\nindicated that Abbott would spend well below the annual minimum in\n\n2003 provided for under the contract.\n\n     Hancock never made a contribution for 2003.                        Rather, the\n\ncompany   sued   Abbott    in   the    district      court    for   a   declaratory\n\njudgment that its payment obligations had terminated.                         After\n\npretrial proceedings, the parties consented to have the district\n\ncourt resolve their dispute on the papers as a \"case stated,\"\n\nmeaning that the district court \"could make findings of fact\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\finstead    of   granting    inferences    to    each   non-movant   in   turn.\"\n\nDiGregorio v. Hartford Comp. Employee Ben. Serv. Co., 423 F.3d 6,\n\n12 (1st Cir. 2005).         In due course, the district court issued a\n\nthorough 65-page opinion, finding in Hancock's favor both on the\n\nquestion of whether Abbott was required to plan on spending at\n\nleast the Aggregate Spending Target through 2004, and on whether\n\nAbbott's failure to do so allowed Hancock to cancel its 2003\n\npayment, as well as its payment for 2004.\n\n                                       II.\n\n     The district court determined that, for the most part, the\n\ncontract    between   the    parties     was   \"unambiguous   and   that   the\n\ninterpretation proffered by Hancock is the only reasonable one.\"\n\nThe district court did identify two ambiguities in the contract\n\nthat were relevant to the dispute between the parties.              As to one\n\nof these ambiguities, which we explain later in this opinion, the\n\ndistrict court considered extrinsic evidence and made findings of\n\nfact on the intent of the contracting parties.           As we also explain,\n\nthe other \"ambiguity\" identified by the district court was really\n\nan issue of contract interpretation, and was resolved as such.               On\n\nboth issues, the district court concluded that Hancock had the\n\nstronger case.\n\n     On appeal, Abbott challenges the district court's findings and\n\nconclusions with three arguments.              First, Abbott says that the\n\ncontract allowed it to plan to spend the Aggregate Spending Target\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fover    five   years   instead      of    four.     Anticipating       the   possible\n\nrejection      of   this   claim,    Abbott       also   makes   two    alternative\n\narguments that, if accepted, would entitle it to Hancock's 2003\n\npayment of multiple millions.             Abbott says that the event allowing\n\nHancock to stop paying happened in 2003, not 2002, and so Hancock\n\nhad to make its payment for that year.3              Even if the relevant event\n\nhappened in 2002, meaning that Hancock was potentially freed of its\n\nobligation to make a 2003 payment, Abbott contends that Hancock\n\nwaived that right by failing to recognize the 2002 event promptly.\n\n    We address these arguments in turn.\n\nA.     Jurisdiction and standard of review\n\n        Like the district court, we will accept the parties' agreement\n\non forum selection and choice of law.                    The contract allows any\n\ndisputes between the parties to be decided in the federal district\n\ncourt in Massachusetts.        Based on the parties' complete diversity\n\nof citizenship and the dollar amount at issue, this case is\n\nproperly in federal court.               See 28 U.S.C. § 1332.         The contract\n\ncalls on us to apply Illinois contract law (Abbott is based in\n\nIllinois), which the parties agree should govern.                 We are \"free to\n\nforego independent inquiry and accept that agreement.\"                   Cochran v.\n\nQuest Software, Inc., 328 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n        As to matters of law decided on summary judgment, such as\n\n\n3\n  As we noted above, the contract provided, \"For the avoidance of\ndoubt, [Hancock's] Program Payments for the Program Year in which\n[a terminable] event occurs shall still be due and payable.\"\n\n                                          -11-\n\fcontract interpretation, our review is de novo.             See Utica Mutual\n\nIns. Co. v. Weathermark Investments, Inc., 292 F.3d 77, 80 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).      If it were necessary to review the district court's\n\nfactual findings, our review would be far more deferential.                 See\n\nPrincipal Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Racal-Datacom, Inc., 233 F.3d 1,\n\n3 (1st Cir. 2000).       However, as we will discuss, we believe that\n\nthe   contract    is   unambiguous   on   the   points    necessary   for   the\n\ndisposition of this appeal, permitting us to affirm on the plain\n\nmeaning of the contract alone.              See States Res. Corp. v. The\n\nArchitectural Team, Inc., 433 F.3d 73, 80 (2005) (recognizing that\n\nthe court of appeals can affirm a grant on summary judgment on any\n\nbasis made apparent by the record).\n\nB. Abbott's planning obligations\n\n      Hancock's position is easily summarized. The contract allowed\n\nHancock to stop paying if Abbott did not \"reasonably demonstrate in\n\nits Annual Research Plan, its intent and reasonable expectation to\n\nexpend on Program Related Costs during the Program Term an amount\n\nin excess of [the Aggregate Spending Target]\" (emphasis added).\n\nThe contract defines \"Program Term\" as \"a period of four (4)\n\nconsecutive Program Years\" (emphasis added).             The contract defines\n\n\"Program Year\" as \"a period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar\n\nmonths commencing on January 1 of each year, except that the first\n\nProgram Year shall commence on the Execution Date and end on\n\nDecember 31, 2001.\"       This means, according to Hancock, that the\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f\"Program Term\" ended on December 31, 2004, and that Abbott was\n\nrequired to budget in its \"Annual Research Plans\" to spend the\n\nAggregate Spending Target by that date.                   Since Abbott planned to\n\nspend less than the Aggregate Spending Target by the end of 2004,\n\nHancock could stop paying.\n\n      Abbott's more complicated position relies on the fact that the\n\n\"carryover\" provisions in the contract allowed the company to\n\npostpone    actual    attainment        of   the   Aggregate      Spending   Target\n\nthreshold    until    the   end    of   2005.       According     to   Abbott,    the\n\ncarryover provisions, by implication, also freed the company of any\n\nobligation to plan to spend all of the Aggregate Spending Target by\n\nthe end of 2004. Hancock counters that the carryover provisions do\n\nnot by their terms apply to Abbott's planned spending, but only to\n\nits actual spending.        The sense of this distinction, Hancock and\n\nthe district court agreed, is that unforseen circumstances during\n\nthe   fourth   year    might      reasonably       have    been   thought    by   the\n\ncontract's     drafters     to     excuse      strict      compliance    with     the\n\ncontractually agreed spending, even if a mere change in plans on\n\nAbbott's part would not.\n\n      Hancock has by far the stronger argument.                   As the district\n\ncourt recognized, Abbott's approach is belied by the contract's\n\ndefinition of \"Program Term.\"\n\n      In Illinois, as elsewhere, \"[i]t is a basic and fundamental\n\ntenet of contract law [] that even if a contract offers only a\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\flimited definition of a term, it must be applied as written.\"\n\nConn. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Loop Paper Recycling, Inc., 824 N.E.2d\n\n1125, 1133 (Ill. App. 2005).   Put another way: \"A court . . . may\n\nnot interpret [a] contract in a way contrary to the plain and\n\nobvious meaning of its terms.\"    Krilich v. American Nat. Bank &\n\nTrust Co. of Chicago, 778 N.E.2d 1153, 1164 (Ill. App. 2002).   See\n\nalso In re Blinds to Go Share Purchase Litigation, 443 F.3d 1, 7\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (\"Where the parties to a contract take pains to\n\ndefine a key term specially, their dealings under the contract are\n\ngoverned by that definition.\"); Alexian Bros. Health Providers\n\nAss'n v. Humana Health Plan, Inc., 330 F. Supp. 2d 970, 975 (N.D.\n\nIll. 2004) (\"[P]arties to a contract may serve as their own\n\nlexicographers and may assign a particular meaning to any word they\n\nchoose.\").\n\n     In light of these precedents, we need look no further than the\n\ncontract's own definition of \"Program Term\" as \"a period of four\n\n(4) consecutive Program Years.\"       When the contract said that\n\n\"Hancock's obligation to make any remaining Program Payments    . .\n\n. shall terminate\" if Abbott did not \"reasonably demonstrate in its\n\nAnnual Research Plan, its intent and reasonable expectation to\n\nexpend on Program Related Costs during the Program Term an amount\n\nin excess of [the Aggregate Spending Target]\" (emphasis added), the\n\ncontract meant that Hancock could stop paying if Abbott did not\n\n\"demonstrate . . . its intent and reasonable expectation\" to spend\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fthe money by the end of 2004.     Abbott insists that \"[n]owhere does\n\n[the contract] provide that Abbott must forfeit Hancock's payments\n\nif Abbott forecasts [] that it will need [a] fifth year\" to spend\n\nthe Aggregate Spending Target.     But the contract provides exactly\n\nthat.\n\n     As the district court stated, reading the contract as it was\n\nwritten does not somehow make the contract illogical, irrational,\n\nor \"commercially unreasonable.\"     Cf. Beanstalk Group, Inc. v. A.M.\n\nGen. Corp., 283 F.3d 856, 860 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"[A] contract will\n\nnot be interpreted literally if doing so would produce absurd\n\nresults that the parties, presumed to be rational persons pursuing\n\nrational ends, are unlikely to have agreed to seek.\").          Abbott and\n\nHancock reasonably could agree that Abbott would be bound by the\n\ncontract to make all reasonable efforts to spend the Aggregate\n\nSpending Target on the joint project by the end of 2004.          Hancock\n\nhad obvious reasons to prefer such an obligation: the more Abbott\n\nspent on the project during its first four years, the greater\n\nHancock's returns were likely to be.         Abbott had good reasons to\n\naccede to Hancock's demands: Hancock provided an enormous infusion\n\nof funds on favorable terms.       And Abbott and Hancock reasonably\n\ncould   agree   that,   despite   Abbott's    obligation   to   make   all\n\nreasonable attempts to spend the Aggregate Spending Target through\n\n2004, the company should have the ability to stretch its actual\n\nexpenditure of funds into a fifth year, if unexpected events during\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f2004 made it impossible to spend the money as soon as planned.   The\n\nparties shared an interest in avoiding unnecessary or inefficient\n\nlast-minute spending on the project.   In light of these plausible\n\ngoals, it made sense for the contract to provide that Abbott was\n\nrequired to plan to spend the Aggregate Spending Target by December\n\n31, 2004, but that it was not required to actually spend the money\n\nby that time.     Whether this was the best, fairest, or most\n\nefficient way to structure the contract is not our concern.4\n\n     Referring to the rule that a contract must be read as a whole,\n\nAbbott places great reliance on the appearance of the phrase \"any\n\nextension period of the Program Term\" in the contractual definition\n\nof \"Program Related Costs.\" \"Program Related Costs,\" not otherwise\n\nrelevant here, were costs that Abbott could count as expenditures\n\non the joint program.   The definition provided:\n\n     \"Program Related Costs\" shall mean (i) all direct\n     and indirect costs and expenses that are incurred\n     by Abbott during a given Program Year . . . and\n     (ii) the milestone and license fees paid during a\n     given Program Year or during any extension period\n\n\n4\n  Abbott says repeatedly -- in its brief and at oral argument --\nthat the contract must be read to impose a two to one ratio of\nAbbott's spending to Hancock's.    Abbott criticizes the district\ncourt for allowing actual spending in roughly a four to one ratio.\nBut the contract never required Hancock to spend half as much as\nAbbott. Indeed, Abbott's initial projection was that it would spend\nfive times as much as Hancock. What the contract did not allow was\nfor Abbott to spend less than 1.87 times as much as Hancock\n(Hancock's maximum contribution was approximately one-third of the\nAggregate Spending Target, and Abbott's minimum was approximately\ntwo-thirds of the Aggregate Spending Target). Our resolution of\nthis dispute is fully consistent with these principles agreed to by\nthe parties.\n\n                          -16-\n\f      of the Program Term . . ..\n\nAccording to Abbott, the phrase \"extension period\" in the above-\n\nquoted paragraph frees the company from any obligation to plan for\n\nspending the Aggregate Spending Target by the end of 2004.\n\n      The district court found Abbott's \"extension period\" argument\n\nunpersuasive.        We agree, though for different reasons.5          The\n\nlanguage Abbott relies on does not purport to alter the meaning of\n\n\"Program Term,\" which is the definition that matters in the section\n\nallowing Hancock to terminate its payments.        As the district court\n\nstated, \"the Agreement defines 'Program Term' specifically and\n\nwithout exception as 'a period of four (4) consecutive Program\n\nYears. . . .    Thus, the Program Term, as defined by the Agreement,\n\nran   from   March    13,   2001   through   December   31,   2004.\"   The\n\ncontractual relationship between Abbott and Hancock would continue\n\nbeyond the end of 2004, the district court recognized, because\n\nAbbott would remain responsible for making payments to Hancock.\n\nBut that continuation did not free Abbott from its obligation to\n\nplan to spend the Aggregate Spending Target during the \"Program\n\nTerm\" itself.    Additionally, there are contextual clues far more\n\n\n5\n   The district court found the \"extension period\" language\nambiguous. It then conducted a skillful and convincing analysis of\nsome 40 contract drafts that preceded the final version. On the\nbasis of that review, the district court found that \"extension\nperiod\" was a \"vestige\" from a previous draft that the parties\nmistakenly failed to delete from the final contract. If we were\nnot able to resolve the issue on the plain language of the\ncontract, we would readily adopt the district court's factual\nfindings on the ambiguity.\n\n                                     -17-\n\frelevant to this controversy that eliminate any chance that the\n\nparties to the contract intended the \"Program Term\" to be five\n\nyears    rather   than   four.    For   instance,   the   very   carryover\n\nprovisions Abbott relies on refer to the \"Program Term\" and \"the\n\nsubsequent year commencing immediately after the end of the Program\n\nTerm.\"    The only plausible reading of the contract is that \"the\n\nsubsequent year commencing immediately after the end of the Program\n\nTerm\" is the year 2005.          The \"Program Term\" itself ended on\n\nDecember 31, 2004.\n\n     In short, the contract required that Abbott plan to spend the\n\nAggregate Spending Target during the \"Program Term.\"         The contract\n\ndefined the \"Program Term\" as the period beginning on the day the\n\ncontract was signed and ending on December 31, 2004.                Abbott\n\nunambiguously revealed in its 2003 plan that it did not plan to\n\nspend the Aggregate Spending Target by the end of 2004. Therefore,\n\nunder the terms of the contract, Hancock could terminate its\n\npayments.\n\nC.   The year of the terminable event -- 2002 or 2003?\n\n     Abbott argues in the alternative that, even if Hancock could\n\nwithhold its 2004 payment in light of Abbott's failure to forecast\n\nspending the Aggregate Spending Target through 2004, Hancock could\n\nnot cancel its 2003 payment. Abbott rests this argument on wording\n\nin the same section of the contract that allowed Hancock to stop\n\npaying if Abbott did not \"reasonably demonstrate in its Annual\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fResearch Plan, its intent and reasonable expectation to expend on\n\nProgram Related Costs during the Program Term an amount in excess\n\nof [the Aggregate Spending Target].\"    The wording states: \"For the\n\navoidance of doubt, [Hancock's payments] for the Program Year in\n\nwhich [an event that allows the termination of payments] occurs\n\nshall still be due and payable.\"   Abbott says that Hancock stopped\n\npaying on the basis of events that happened in 2003 and that the\n\n2003 payment was therefore still due.     In response, Hancock says\n\nthat the event allowing it to terminate its payments was Abbott's\n\nDecember 2002 \"2003 Preliminary Annual Research Plan,\" which failed\n\nto manifest any intention by Abbott to spend the Aggregate Spending\n\nTarget on the joint project by the end of 2004.   We agree with the\n\ndistrict court that Hancock was not required to make a 2003\n\npayment.\n\n     Abbott argues that the December 20, 2002 document cannot be\n\nconsidered a ground for termination for two reasons: because it was\n\nmarked \"Preliminary\" and because it did not include any statement\n\nof planned spending for 2004.      Neither of these rationales is\n\nconvincing.   Hancock was not obligated to wait for an annual\n\nresearch plan labeled \"Final.\"   When Abbott sent Hancock the \"2003\n\nPreliminary Annual Research Plan\" in December 2002, it also said\n\nthat the 30-day period for Hancock's payment was running, a sure\n\nindication that Abbott considered its yearly reporting obligations\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fto be complete.6   This demand for payment conformed to Abbott's\n\npractice from the previous year of treating a \"Preliminary\" annual\n\nplan as the \"Annual Plan\" required by the contract.   Additionally,\n\nAbbott gave no indication that another plan, which might indicate\n\nsatisfactory planned spending for 2004, was coming.\n\n     Abbott also says that the December 2002 document was not a\n\nterminable event because it did not contain any projections for\n\n2004. This argument fails in light of the contractual language and\n\nAbbott's later admissions.   As we discussed above, the contract\n\nallowed Hancock to terminate its payments if Abbott did \"not\n\ndemonstrate in its Annual Research Plan its intent and reasonable\n\nexpectation\" to spend at least the Aggregate Spending Target in\n\njoint funds on the project \"during the Program Term.\"    The \"2003\n\nPreliminary Annual Research Plan,\" submitted in 2002, plainly did\n\n\"not demonstrate\" any intention by Abbott to spend the Aggregate\n\nSpending Target through 2004.     Actually, due to the computer\n\nglitch, the document \"did not demonstrate\" a plan to spend anything\n\nat all in 2004.    But -- as Abbott later admitted -- even if the\n\ndocument had been complete, it would have shown \"the estimated\n\n\n\n6\n  Under the contract, Abbott was supposed to send Hancock the\nAnnual Research Plan \"at least forty-five (45) days prior to the\nstart of each Program Year\" and the Status Report \"no later than\nthirty (30) days before the last day of each Program Year.\"\nHancock was not expected to make its payments any earlier than\nDecember 1 of the year in which they were due.       The contract\nallowed Hancock to delay its payments until 30 days after it had\nreceived both the Status Report and the Annual Research Plan.\n\n                               -20-\n\fspend for 2003 had dropped to [approximately the same amount as in\n\nthe 2003 Preliminary Annual Research Plan] and for 2004, it was at\n\n[an amount that when added to the spending for 2001, 2002 and 2003\n\nwas   less   than   the   Aggregate    Spending   Target].\"   Given   this\n\nadmission by Abbott, Abbott's \"2003 Preliminary Annual Research\n\nPlan,\" submitted in December 2002, failed to manifest the company's\n\nintent to spend the required amount through 2004.             As Hancock\n\npoints out, it was not relieved of its payment obligations merely\n\nbecause another party failed to correct a computer glitch.             If\n\nHancock had requested clarification of the December 20, 2002 plan,\n\nAbbott would have stated that it no longer planed to spend the\n\nAggregate Spending Target by the end of 2004.\n\n      The district court provided a slightly different gloss on the\n\nsame conclusion that the terminable event happened in 2002, relying\n\non the principle of contract interpretation that \"if possible,\n\neffect must be given to all of the language so that provisions\n\nwhich appear to be conflicting or inconsistent may be reconciled\n\nand harmonized.\"     In re Halas, 470 N.E.2d 960, 964 (Ill. 1984).      We\n\nalso find the district court's analysis persuasive.7\n\n      As the district court concluded:\n\n\n\n7\n While the district court suggested that there was an ambiguity to\nresolve in this analysis, the district court also stated that the\nissue \"translated into a contractual interpretation argument\" and\nrequired no parol evidence.    Because a careful reading of the\ncontract itself resolved the issue, there was no need to resolve\nany ambiguity.\n\n                                      -21-\n\f              [I]t is clear [from the contract language]\n              that the parties intended Abbott to present an\n              [Annual Research Plan] prior to the start of\n              each Program Year that would include . . .\n              budgets for the remaining Program Years in the\n              Program Term. Thus, the parties intended that\n              the [Annual Research Plan] for 2003 would be\n              submitted to Hancock in 2002 and it would\n              include . . . budgets for 2003 and 2004. As a\n              result . . . Abbot's failure to demonstrate\n              its intent and reasonable expectation to\n              expend at least [the Aggregate Spending Target\n              by the end of] 2004 [] took place in 2002, not\n              2003.\n\n(Emphasis added.)       To hold otherwise, the district court reasoned,\n\nwould allow      Abbott \"to obtain two Program Payments (for 2002 and\n\n2003) for the price of one payment obligation termination.\" As the\n\ndistrict court emphasized, the contract gives Abbott one yearly\n\nHancock payment for each conforming year of Abbott's performance.\n\nThe contract would be subverted if Abbott could require an extra\n\npayment   by    Hancock   merely    because   it   was   late   in   submitting\n\ncomplete projections.\n\nD.   Waiver or estoppel\n\n       Abbott's final fallback argument is that Hancock waived the\n\nright to cancel its 2003 payment by waiting until the fall of 2003\n\nto   notify    Abbott   that   it   considered     its   payment     obligations\n\nterminated.      We agree with the district court that Hancock did\n\nnothing that could establish a waiver or estoppel under Illinois\n\nlaw.\n\n       In Illinois, waiver is the \"voluntary relinquishment of a\n\nknown right, claim, or privilege.\"            Vaughn v. Speaker,533 N.E.2d\n\n                                     -22-\n\f885, 890 (Ill. 1988).        It may be \"express or implied.\"               Geier v.\n\nHamer   Enters.     Inc.,    589    N.E.2d    711,     722   (Ill.   App.    1992).\n\nEquitable estoppel may be found where a party indicates through its\n\nconduct that it will not enforce its contractual rights in a timely\n\nfashion and the other party reasonably relies on that conduct to\n\nits detriment.       See Geddes v. Mill Creek Country Club, 751 N.E.2d\n\n1150, 1157 (Ill. 2001).            Abbott's waiver and estoppel arguments\n\nshare a common problem: they do not establish that Hancock conveyed\n\nany intention to relinquish a contractual \"right or privilege.\" We\n\ndiscuss    briefly    Abbot's      three   principal     waiver      and   estoppel\n\narguments, resolving them on this common ground.\n\n     Abbott first argues that Hancock should have made an earlier\n\nnotification that it planned to terminate its payments.                    However,\n\nthe contract does not contain any requirement that Hancock notify\n\nAbbott when a terminable event occurred.                 To the contrary, the\n\ncontract   states     that   \"Hancock's       entire    obligation     [under   the\n\ncontract] shall be limited to providing [its] program payments.\"\n\nFurther, the contract provides that \"[t]he waiver by either party\n\nhereto of any right hereunder or the failure to perform or of a\n\nbreach by the other party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other\n\nright hereunder . . ..\"            Hancock could not waive its right to\n\nterminate payments by failing to provide a notification that it was\n\nnot required to make.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\f       Abbott also contends that Hancock indicated that it was\n\nsatisfied with the December 2002 \"2003 Preliminary Annual Research\n\nPlan\" by tendering its 2002 payment upon receipt of that document,\n\nand that Abbott relied on that payment as an indication that the\n\nDecember 20, 2002 plan was sufficient.             But Hancock's payment for\n\n2002 could not have been any indication that Hancock considered the\n\n\"2003 Preliminary Annual Research Plan\" as compliant with Abbott's\n\nplanning obligations. Even if Hancock considered the plan a breach\n\nby Abbott, Hancock had no choice but to make its 2002 payment.\n\nAfter all, the contract provided that Hancock's payment \"for the\n\nProgram Year in which [an event that allows the termination of\n\npayments] occurs shall still be due and payable.\"                Abbott's breach\n\noccurred in 2002.        Hancock paid for 2002.      That is merely what the\n\ncontract required.\n\n       Abbott finally claims that Hancock forfeited its right to deem\n\nthe    December   2002    \"2003    Preliminary     Annual    Research    Plan\"   a\n\nterminable event by failing to make a timely request for a 2003\n\nAnnual Research Plan that included planned spending for 2004. This\n\nargument    represents      an    attempt    by   Abbott    to   shift   its   own\n\nresponsibilities to Hancock. The contract made it abundantly clear\n\nthat all responsibility for planning and funding rested with\n\nAbbott.    Hancock's only obligation was to provide large payments\n\nwhen    Abbott    submitted      conforming   documentation.         Given     this\n\narrangement, it was reasonable for both parties to accept the \"2003\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fPreliminary Annual Research Plan,\" submitted in December 2002, as\n\nAbbott's final word on the subject.             That December 2002 plan\n\nallowed Hancock to terminate its payments because it did not\n\nmanifest Abbott's intention to spend the contractually prescribed\n\namount   during   the   Program   Term   (and   because   any   request   for\n\nclarification of the document merely would have confirmed that\n\nAbbott did not intend to spend enough during the Program Term).\n\nHancock did not have to ask for clarification before it deemed the\n\nDecember 2002 Plan a breach by Abbott allowing it to terminate its\n\npayments.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f",

The amendments\ndo not in any way affect the substance of the opinion.\n\f            LIPEZ,     Circuit    Judge.      John    Hancock     Life    Insurance\n\nCompany    and   two   of   its   subsidiaries       (collectively       \"Hancock\")\n\ncontracted with Abbott Laboratories (\"Abbott\") to join in financing\n\nthe development of some pharmaceutical compounds.                   In exchange,\n\nAbbott promised to share with Hancock any profits the compounds\n\nwould generate.        It soon became apparent that a number of the\n\ncompounds had no good prospect of commercial success.                          Abbott\n\nscaled    back   and   delayed    its   planned      investment    in    the   joint\n\nproject.    Arguing that Abbott had failed to uphold its part of the\n\nbargain, Hancock stopped contributing funds altogether.                     Hancock\n\nthen sued for a declaratory judgment, asking the district court to\n\nrule that, under the contract between the parties, Abbott's delayed\n\ninvestment allowed Hancock to terminate its payments but retain its\n\nshare of any future profits.        Abbott countersued, arguing that the\n\ncontract explicitly allowed it to delay its contributions to the\n\nproject.    The parties consented to have the district court decide\n\nthe case on the papers submitted, and, on cross motions, the\n\ndistrict court entered judgment for Hancock.                    Abbott appeals,\n\nessentially arguing that the district court incorrectly construed\n\nthe contract.     We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n     We discuss the contract between Hancock and Abbott and then\n\ntheir course of dealings.         We leave some details for discussion in\n\nconnection with Abbott's appellate arguments.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fA.   The contract\n\n     In 1999, Hancock and Abbott began negotiating the joint\n\nventure at issue.   While the specifics evolved through 40 contract\n\ndrafts, the basics of the final agreement are relatively simple.\n\nAbbott and Hancock would select a \"basket\" of research compounds\n\nthat Abbott had identified as possible pharmaceutical products and\n\nthat Hancock thought were promising.     Hancock would contribute\n\nmultiple millions each year for four consecutive years towards the\n\ndevelopment of these compounds.   Abbott would spend at least 1.86\n\ntimes as much as Hancock over this initial period of development.\n\nThe parties would share any profits from the compounds for roughly\n\nfifteen years from the contract's inception, and Abbott would pay\n\nHancock set amounts when the joint project accomplished certain\n\ndevelopment or regulatory goals.     In short, Hancock agreed to\n\nprovide substantial start-up investment for the project, and Abbott\n\nagreed to match that investment.      Because Hancock would share\n\nprofits only for a set number of years, it stood to gain if the\n\ncompounds were developed quickly (and if they turned out to be\n\nuseful) and stood to lose if development were delayed (or if the\n\ncompounds were unsuccessful).\n\n     For our purposes, the final contract between the parties,\n\nwhich was signed on March 13, 2001, can be summarized.\n\n     ! The parties agreed to partner in the development\n     of a basket of     compounds, with each compound\n     thought to have a potential pharmaceutical use.\n\n\n                           -3-\n\f     ! Hancock agreed to reimburse multiple millions of\n     Abbott's spending on the joint project in four\n     multiple million dollar payments – one for each\n     year 2001 through 2004.\n\n     ! Abbott agreed to provide an additional annual\n     minimum contribution of un-reimbursed funds to the\n     project in each of the four years.\n\n     ! Abbott also agreed that its and Hancock's\n     combined spending on the project would be \"at\n     least\" the Aggregate Spending Target over the\n     \"Program Term,\" which the contract defined as \"a\n     period of four (4) consecutive Program Years.\"1 In\n     other words, by December 31, 2004, Abbott would\n     provide approximately two-thirds of the Aggregate\n     Spending Target to the project above and beyond the\n     one-third of the Aggregate Spending Target that\n     Hancock promised to contribute.\n\n     ! Abbott was \"permitted\" to \"change its funding\n     obligations [] only as follows\":\n\n          (a) If Abbott expended Hancock's yearly\n          contribution during a \"Program Year\" but did\n          not contribute its annual minimum contribution\n          of its own un-reimbursed funds, Abbott could\n          \"carryover\" its obligation to the following\n          year.     The balance of Abbott's yearly\n          obligation, termed the \"Annual Carryover\n          Amount,\" would be added to Abbott's minimum\n          contribution for the \"subsequent Program\n          Year.\"      If   Abbott   carried   over   its\n          contribution, Hancock's obligations for the\n          \"subsequent Program Year\" would be suspended\n          until Abbott spent the \"Annual Carryover\n          Amount.\"\n\n          (b) If Abbott did not spend the entire\n          Aggregate Spending Target \"during the Program\n          Term,\" it could \"carryover\" the balance to the\n          \"subsequent year commencing immediately after\n\n\n1\n  The contract defined a \"Program Year\" as a full calendar year\nbeginning on January 1 and ending on December 31, except that the\nfirst \"Program Year\" would be shortened to begin of the day the\ncontract was signed and to end on December 31, 2001.\n\n                          -4-\n\f            the end of the Program Term.\" If there was\n            such a carryover, the difference between the\n            Aggregate Spending Target and the amount\n            actually spent by the end of the \"Program\n            Term\" would be called the \"Aggregate Carryover\n            Amount.\"\n\n     ! Abbott would update Hancock at least yearly about\n     the project, providing an \"Annual Research Plan\"\n     with a budget for future spending.     Abbott would\n     also provide yearly \"Status Reports\" stating the\n     company's spending on the joint project so far.\n     Hancock's payments were due 30 days after receiving\n     these documents.\n\n     ! In certain enumerated circumstances, including if\n     Abbott \"does not demonstrate in its Annual Research\n     Plan its intent and reasonable expectation\" to\n     spend at least the Aggregate Spending Target in\n     joint funds on the project \"during the Program\n     Term,\"   Hancock's   funding    obligations   would\n     terminate but the rest of the contract (detailing\n     how the parties would share profits) would remain\n     in effect.\n\n     ! Even if one of the enumerated terminable events\n     came to pass and Hancock's payment obligations were\n     cancelled, Hancock would still have to pay its\n     contributions for the year in which the terminable\n     event took place.\n\nB.   The parties' dealings\n\n     2001\n\n     Abbott's first \"Annual Research Plan\" was appended to the\n\nfinal contract, which was executed on March 13, 2001.        It called\n\nfor total project spending almost double the Aggregate Spending\n\nTarget by the end of 2004.     Under this plan, Abbott would spend\n\nmany millions of dollars of its own funds, or roughly five times as\n\nmuch as Hancock, through the end of 2004.       During 2001, Abbott\n\ndecided to halt development of some compounds. In November, Abbott\n\n                                 -5-\n\fsent Hancock a document titled \"2002 Preliminary Annual Research\n\nPlan,\" which called for total spending of less than Abbott's first\n\nAnnual Research Plan but more than the Aggregate Spending Target\n\nthrough 2004. In December, Abbott sent the \"2001 Status Report\" on\n\nthe year's spending, revealing that spending on the project would\n\ntotal multiple millions less by year's end (compared to the amount\n\nthat had been planned). Abbott's cover letter for the \"2001 Status\n\nReport\" stated that Hancock's 2001 payment was due in 30 days, an\n\nindication that Abbott believed its contractual obligations for the\n\nyear had been satisfied.      This was so even though the only \"Annual\n\nResearch Plan\" Abbott had given Hancock was marked \"Preliminary.\"\n\nAbbott did not manifest any intention to send an update to the\n\n\"2002 Preliminary Annual Research Plan.\"         Apparently agreeing that\n\nthe \"Preliminary\" plan satisfied Abbott's reporting obligation for\n\n2001, and that Abbott's obligations for that year were complete,\n\nHancock timely provided its 2001 contribution of multiple millions.\n\n     2002\n\n     In   2002,   Abbott    decided   to    terminate   development   of   an\n\nadditional compound because the scientific results did not warrant\n\nfurther development.       Abbott also dramatically reduced efforts on\n\nsome other compounds.       As a result, less than two years into the\n\njoint project, Abbott was      pursuing a significantly smaller number\n\nof the    original basket of compounds with full effort.              Abbott\n\nsubmitted its \"2002 Status Report\" and the \"2003 Preliminary Annual\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fResearch Plan\" together on December 20, 2002.                The Status Report\n\nrevealed that 2002 spending on the project would be far less than\n\nthe \"2002 Preliminary Annual Research Plan\" had promised. The Plan\n\nstated that spending for 2003 would also be significantly less than\n\nAbbott had estimated the year before.                 The Plan, however, was\n\nsilent as to 2004.          Unlike the previous year's version, the Plan\n\ndivulged the company's planned spending only for the next year.\n\n(Abbott later explained that the 2004 numbers had not been listed\n\nin   the   \"2003   Preliminary      Annual     Research   Plan\"    because     of   a\n\ncomputer error.)       As it had the previous year, Abbott stated in a\n\ncover    letter,     also   sent   on    December   20,   that    Hancock's    2002\n\ncontribution was due in 30 days.                Again, Abbott manifested no\n\nintention to update its \"Preliminary\" report and gave no indication\n\nthat the document was not the planning statement required by the\n\ncontract.     Hancock timely provided its reimbursement of multiple\n\nmillions.2\n\n      2003\n\n      During further review of the \"2003 Preliminary Annual Research\n\nPlan,\"     Hancock    noticed      the   document's    failure     to   make    any\n\nprediction of spending in 2004, a lapse that the company appears to\n\nhave overlooked on its initial review.              During a September 9, 2003\n\nconference call, Hancock asked Abbott to supplement the plan with\n\n\n2\n The 30th day after December 20 was January 19, a Sunday. Hancock\ntendered its payment the next business day. Abbott accepted the\npayment without comment and agrees that it was timely.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fthe missing information.       Abbott's Controller then sent Hancock a\n\nletter, dated September 22, 2003, stating the following:\n\n      I went back to review the data and spend estimates\n      made about 1 year ago for 2003. On 8/26/02, the\n      estimated program spend for 2003 was at [more than\n      indicated in the 2003 Preliminary Annual Research\n      Plan].   By October 14, 2002, after the Executive\n      Committee's portfolio review, the estimated spend\n      for 2003 had dropped to [approximately the same\n      amount as in the 2003 Preliminary Annual Research\n      Plan] and for 2004, it was at [an amount that when\n      added to the spending for 2001, 2002 and 2003 was\n      less than the Aggregate Spending Target].\n\nThis was an important admission.            Abbott confirmed that if there\n\nhad   been   no   computer   error   and    the   \"2003    Preliminary   Annual\n\nResearch Report\" had included planned spending for 2004, it would\n\nhave shown that Abbott planned to spend only an amount less than\n\npreviously projected, which would mean that spending through the\n\nend of 2004 would total -- at the most -- an amount less than the\n\nAggregate    Spending   Target.       The    earlier      status   reports   had\n\nindicated that Abbott's spending for 2001 and 2002 would be higher.\n\nIn its October 2002 reviews, Abbott had projected higher spending\n\nfor 2003 and for 2004.\n\n      To the same September 22, 2003 letter, Abbott attached a\n\ndocument it called \"the Final 2003 Plan.\"          This version of the 2003\n\nplan indicated that Abbott's spending during the Program Term would\n\nbe even lower than it had projected in October 2002.                     Abbott\n\nforecasted total spending of less than the Aggregate Spending\n\nTarget through 2004 and an additional amount in 2005.               Under this\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fprojection, total spending through 2004 would fall many millions\n\nshort of the Aggregate Spending Target.                    However, Abbott would\n\nexceed the threshold if 2005 spending were included.\n\n     After reviewing the updated 2003 plan, Hancock sent Abbott a\n\nletter, dated October 10, stating that its \"obligation to make any\n\nremaining   Program    Payments       to    Abbott   for    [2003   and    2004]   is\n\nterminated\" because \"the Final 2003 Plan, in conjunction with the\n\nmore limited information contained in the Preliminary 2003 Annual\n\nResearch Plan . . . did not, and does not, reasonably demonstrate\n\nAbbott's intent and reasonable expectation to\" spend the Aggregate\n\nSpending Target on the joint project \"during the Program Term.\"\n\n     Shortly thereafter, Abbott sent Hancock a \"2004 Preliminary\n\nAnnual Research Plan,\" which projected total project spending                      for\n\n2004 and 2005.     Cumulative spending on the project would be less\n\nthan the Aggregate Spending Target through 2004 and more than the\n\nAggregate   Spending      Target   through       2005.       The    same   document\n\nindicated that Abbott would spend well below the annual minimum in\n\n2003 provided for under the contract.\n\n     Hancock never made a contribution for 2003.                        Rather, the\n\ncompany   sued   Abbott    in   the    district      court    for   a   declaratory\n\njudgment that its payment obligations had terminated.                         After\n\npretrial proceedings, the parties consented to have the district\n\ncourt resolve their dispute on the papers as a \"case stated,\"\n\nmeaning that the district court \"could make findings of fact\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\finstead    of   granting    inferences    to    each   non-movant   in   turn.\"\n\nDiGregorio v.

Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201811\"><a href=\"/opinion/201811/digregorio-v-hartford-comprehensi/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n12 (1st Cir. 2005).         In due course, the district court issued a\n\nthorough 65-page opinion, finding in Hancock's favor both on the\n\nquestion of whether Abbott was required to plan on spending at\n\nleast the Aggregate Spending Target through 2004, and on whether\n\nAbbott's failure to do so allowed Hancock to cancel its 2003\n\npayment, as well as its payment for 2004.\n\n                                       II.\n\n     The district court determined that, for the most part, the\n\ncontract    between   the    parties     was   \"unambiguous   and   that   the\n\ninterpretation proffered by Hancock is the only reasonable one.\"\n\nThe district court did identify two ambiguities in the contract\n\nthat were relevant to the dispute between the parties.              As to one\n\nof these ambiguities, which we explain later in this opinion, the\n\ndistrict court considered extrinsic evidence and made findings of\n\nfact on the intent of the contracting parties.           As we also explain,\n\nthe other \"ambiguity\" identified by the district court was really\n\nan issue of contract interpretation, and was resolved as such.               On\n\nboth issues, the district court concluded that Hancock had the\n\nstronger case.\n\n     On appeal, Abbott challenges the district court's findings and\n\nconclusions with three arguments.              First, Abbott says that the\n\ncontract allowed it to plan to spend the Aggregate Spending Target\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fover    five   years   instead      of    four.     Anticipating       the   possible\n\nrejection      of   this   claim,    Abbott       also   makes   two    alternative\n\narguments that, if accepted, would entitle it to Hancock's 2003\n\npayment of multiple millions.             Abbott says that the event allowing\n\nHancock to stop paying happened in 2003, not 2002, and so Hancock\n\nhad to make its payment for that year.3              Even if the relevant event\n\nhappened in 2002, meaning that Hancock was potentially freed of its\n\nobligation to make a 2003 payment, Abbott contends that Hancock\n\nwaived that right by failing to recognize the 2002 event promptly.\n\n    We address these arguments in turn.\n\nA.     Jurisdiction and standard of review\n\n        Like the district court, we will accept the parties' agreement\n\non forum selection and choice of law.                    The contract allows any\n\ndisputes between the parties to be decided in the federal district\n\ncourt in Massachusetts.        Based on the parties' complete diversity\n\nof citizenship and the dollar amount at issue, this case is\n\nproperly in federal court.               See 28 U.S.C. § 1332.         The contract\n\ncalls on us to apply Illinois contract law (Abbott is based in\n\nIllinois), which the parties agree should govern.                 We are \"free to\n\nforego independent inquiry and accept that agreement.\"                   Cochran v.\n\nQuest Software, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200447\"><a href=\"/opinion/200447/cochran-v-quest-software-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n        As to matters of law decided on summary judgment, such as\n\n\n3\n  As we noted above, the contract provided, \"For the avoidance of\ndoubt, [Hancock's] Program Payments for the Program Year in which\n[a terminable] event occurs shall still be due and payable.\"\n\n                                          -11-\n\fcontract interpretation, our review is de novo.

Abbott's planning obligations\n\n      Hancock's position is easily summarized. The contract allowed\n\nHancock to stop paying if Abbott did not \"reasonably demonstrate in\n\nits Annual Research Plan, its intent and reasonable expectation to\n\nexpend on Program Related Costs during the Program Term an amount\n\nin excess of [the Aggregate Spending Target]\" (emphasis added).\n\nThe contract defines \"Program Term\" as \"a period of four (4)\n\nconsecutive Program Years\" (emphasis added).             The contract defines\n\n\"Program Year\" as \"a period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar\n\nmonths commencing on January 1 of each year, except that the first\n\nProgram Year shall commence on the Execution Date and end on\n\nDecember 31, 2001.\"       This means, according to Hancock, that the\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f\"Program Term\" ended on December 31, 2004, and that Abbott was\n\nrequired to budget in its \"Annual Research Plans\" to spend the\n\nAggregate Spending Target by that date.                   Since Abbott planned to\n\nspend less than the Aggregate Spending Target by the end of 2004,\n\nHancock could stop paying.\n\n      Abbott's more complicated position relies on the fact that the\n\n\"carryover\" provisions in the contract allowed the company to\n\npostpone    actual    attainment        of   the   Aggregate      Spending   Target\n\nthreshold    until    the   end    of   2005.       According     to   Abbott,    the\n\ncarryover provisions, by implication, also freed the company of any\n\nobligation to plan to spend all of the Aggregate Spending Target by\n\nthe end of 2004. Hancock counters that the carryover provisions do\n\nnot by their terms apply to Abbott's planned spending, but only to\n\nits actual spending.        The sense of this distinction, Hancock and\n\nthe district court agreed, is that unforseen circumstances during\n\nthe   fourth   year    might      reasonably       have    been   thought    by   the\n\ncontract's     drafters     to     excuse      strict      compliance    with     the\n\ncontractually agreed spending, even if a mere change in plans on\n\nAbbott's part would not.\n\n      Hancock has by far the stronger argument.                   As the district\n\ncourt recognized, Abbott's approach is belied by the contract's\n\ndefinition of \"Program Term.\"\n\n      In Illinois, as elsewhere, \"[i]t is a basic and fundamental\n\ntenet of contract law [] that even if a contract offers only a\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\flimited definition of a term, it must be applied as written.\"\n\nConn.

Abbott and\n\nHancock reasonably could agree that Abbott would be bound by the\n\ncontract to make all reasonable efforts to spend the Aggregate\n\nSpending Target on the joint project by the end of 2004.          Hancock\n\nhad obvious reasons to prefer such an obligation: the more Abbott\n\nspent on the project during its first four years, the greater\n\nHancock's returns were likely to be.         Abbott had good reasons to\n\naccede to Hancock's demands: Hancock provided an enormous infusion\n\nof funds on favorable terms.       And Abbott and Hancock reasonably\n\ncould   agree   that,   despite   Abbott's    obligation   to   make   all\n\nreasonable attempts to spend the Aggregate Spending Target through\n\n2004, the company should have the ability to stretch its actual\n\nexpenditure of funds into a fifth year, if unexpected events during\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f2004 made it impossible to spend the money as soon as planned.   The\n\nparties shared an interest in avoiding unnecessary or inefficient\n\nlast-minute spending on the project.   In light of these plausible\n\ngoals, it made sense for the contract to provide that Abbott was\n\nrequired to plan to spend the Aggregate Spending Target by December\n\n31, 2004, but that it was not required to actually spend the money\n\nby that time.     Whether this was the best, fairest, or most\n\nefficient way to structure the contract is not our concern.4\n\n     Referring to the rule that a contract must be read as a whole,\n\nAbbott places great reliance on the appearance of the phrase \"any\n\nextension period of the Program Term\" in the contractual definition\n\nof \"Program Related Costs.\" \"Program Related Costs,\" not otherwise\n\nrelevant here, were costs that Abbott could count as expenditures\n\non the joint program.   The definition provided:\n\n     \"Program Related Costs\" shall mean (i) all direct\n     and indirect costs and expenses that are incurred\n     by Abbott during a given Program Year . . . and\n     (ii) the milestone and license fees paid during a\n     given Program Year or during any extension period\n\n\n4\n  Abbott says repeatedly -- in its brief and at oral argument --\nthat the contract must be read to impose a two to one ratio of\nAbbott's spending to Hancock's.    Abbott criticizes the district\ncourt for allowing actual spending in roughly a four to one ratio.\nBut the contract never required Hancock to spend half as much as\nAbbott. Indeed, Abbott's initial projection was that it would spend\nfive times as much as Hancock. What the contract did not allow was\nfor Abbott to spend less than 1.87 times as much as Hancock\n(Hancock's maximum contribution was approximately one-third of the\nAggregate Spending Target, and Abbott's minimum was approximately\ntwo-thirds of the Aggregate Spending Target). Our resolution of\nthis dispute is fully consistent with these principles agreed to by\nthe parties.\n\n                          -16-\n\f      of the Program Term . . ..\n\nAccording to Abbott, the phrase \"extension period\" in the above-\n\nquoted paragraph frees the company from any obligation to plan for\n\nspending the Aggregate Spending Target by the end of 2004.\n\n      The district court found Abbott's \"extension period\" argument\n\nunpersuasive.        We agree, though for different reasons.5          The\n\nlanguage Abbott relies on does not purport to alter the meaning of\n\n\"Program Term,\" which is the definition that matters in the section\n\nallowing Hancock to terminate its payments.        As the district court\n\nstated, \"the Agreement defines 'Program Term' specifically and\n\nwithout exception as 'a period of four (4) consecutive Program\n\nYears. . . .    Thus, the Program Term, as defined by the Agreement,\n\nran   from   March    13,   2001   through   December   31,   2004.\"   The\n\ncontractual relationship between Abbott and Hancock would continue\n\nbeyond the end of 2004, the district court recognized, because\n\nAbbott would remain responsible for making payments to Hancock.\n\nBut that continuation did not free Abbott from its obligation to\n\nplan to spend the Aggregate Spending Target during the \"Program\n\nTerm\" itself.    Additionally, there are contextual clues far more\n\n\n5\n   The district court found the \"extension period\" language\nambiguous. It then conducted a skillful and convincing analysis of\nsome 40 contract drafts that preceded the final version. On the\nbasis of that review, the district court found that \"extension\nperiod\" was a \"vestige\" from a previous draft that the parties\nmistakenly failed to delete from the final contract. If we were\nnot able to resolve the issue on the plain language of the\ncontract, we would readily adopt the district court's factual\nfindings on the ambiguity.\n\n                                     -17-\n\frelevant to this controversy that eliminate any chance that the\n\nparties to the contract intended the \"Program Term\" to be five\n\nyears    rather   than   four.    For   instance,   the   very   carryover\n\nprovisions Abbott relies on refer to the \"Program Term\" and \"the\n\nsubsequent year commencing immediately after the end of the Program\n\nTerm.\"    The only plausible reading of the contract is that \"the\n\nsubsequent year commencing immediately after the end of the Program\n\nTerm\" is the year 2005.          The \"Program Term\" itself ended on\n\nDecember 31, 2004.\n\n     In short, the contract required that Abbott plan to spend the\n\nAggregate Spending Target during the \"Program Term.\"         The contract\n\ndefined the \"Program Term\" as the period beginning on the day the\n\ncontract was signed and ending on December 31, 2004.                Abbott\n\nunambiguously revealed in its 2003 plan that it did not plan to\n\nspend the Aggregate Spending Target by the end of 2004. Therefore,\n\nunder the terms of the contract, Hancock could terminate its\n\npayments.\n\nC.   The year of the terminable event -- 2002 or 2003?\n\n     Abbott argues in the alternative that, even if Hancock could\n\nwithhold its 2004 payment in light of Abbott's failure to forecast\n\nspending the Aggregate Spending Target through 2004, Hancock could\n\nnot cancel its 2003 payment. Abbott rests this argument on wording\n\nin the same section of the contract that allowed Hancock to stop\n\npaying if Abbott did not \"reasonably demonstrate in its Annual\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fResearch Plan, its intent and reasonable expectation to expend on\n\nProgram Related Costs during the Program Term an amount in excess\n\nof [the Aggregate Spending Target].\"    The wording states: \"For the\n\navoidance of doubt, [Hancock's payments] for the Program Year in\n\nwhich [an event that allows the termination of payments] occurs\n\nshall still be due and payable.\"   Abbott says that Hancock stopped\n\npaying on the basis of events that happened in 2003 and that the\n\n2003 payment was therefore still due.     In response, Hancock says\n\nthat the event allowing it to terminate its payments was Abbott's\n\nDecember 2002 \"2003 Preliminary Annual Research Plan,\" which failed\n\nto manifest any intention by Abbott to spend the Aggregate Spending\n\nTarget on the joint project by the end of 2004.   We agree with the\n\ndistrict court that Hancock was not required to make a 2003\n\npayment.\n\n     Abbott argues that the December 20, 2002 document cannot be\n\nconsidered a ground for termination for two reasons: because it was\n\nmarked \"Preliminary\" and because it did not include any statement\n\nof planned spending for 2004.      Neither of these rationales is\n\nconvincing.   Hancock was not obligated to wait for an annual\n\nresearch plan labeled \"Final.\"   When Abbott sent Hancock the \"2003\n\nPreliminary Annual Research Plan\" in December 2002, it also said\n\nthat the 30-day period for Hancock's payment was running, a sure\n\nindication that Abbott considered its yearly reporting obligations\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fto be complete.6   This demand for payment conformed to Abbott's\n\npractice from the previous year of treating a \"Preliminary\" annual\n\nplan as the \"Annual Plan\" required by the contract.   Additionally,\n\nAbbott gave no indication that another plan, which might indicate\n\nsatisfactory planned spending for 2004, was coming.\n\n     Abbott also says that the December 2002 document was not a\n\nterminable event because it did not contain any projections for\n\n2004. This argument fails in light of the contractual language and\n\nAbbott's later admissions.   As we discussed above, the contract\n\nallowed Hancock to terminate its payments if Abbott did \"not\n\ndemonstrate in its Annual Research Plan its intent and reasonable\n\nexpectation\" to spend at least the Aggregate Spending Target in\n\njoint funds on the project \"during the Program Term.\"    The \"2003\n\nPreliminary Annual Research Plan,\" submitted in 2002, plainly did\n\n\"not demonstrate\" any intention by Abbott to spend the Aggregate\n\nSpending Target through 2004.     Actually, due to the computer\n\nglitch, the document \"did not demonstrate\" a plan to spend anything\n\nat all in 2004.    But -- as Abbott later admitted -- even if the\n\ndocument had been complete, it would have shown \"the estimated\n\n\n\n6\n  Under the contract, Abbott was supposed to send Hancock the\nAnnual Research Plan \"at least forty-five (45) days prior to the\nstart of each Program Year\" and the Status Report \"no later than\nthirty (30) days before the last day of each Program Year.\"\nHancock was not expected to make its payments any earlier than\nDecember 1 of the year in which they were due.       The contract\nallowed Hancock to delay its payments until 30 days after it had\nreceived both the Status Report and the Annual Research Plan.\n\n                               -20-\n\fspend for 2003 had dropped to [approximately the same amount as in\n\nthe 2003 Preliminary Annual Research Plan] and for 2004, it was at\n\n[an amount that when added to the spending for 2001, 2002 and 2003\n\nwas   less   than   the   Aggregate    Spending   Target].\"   Given   this\n\nadmission by Abbott, Abbott's \"2003 Preliminary Annual Research\n\nPlan,\" submitted in December 2002, failed to manifest the company's\n\nintent to spend the required amount through 2004.             As Hancock\n\npoints out, it was not relieved of its payment obligations merely\n\nbecause another party failed to correct a computer glitch.             If\n\nHancock had requested clarification of the December 20, 2002 plan,\n\nAbbott would have stated that it no longer planed to spend the\n\nAggregate Spending Target by the end of 2004.\n\n      The district court provided a slightly different gloss on the\n\nsame conclusion that the terminable event happened in 2002, relying\n\non the principle of contract interpretation that \"if possible,\n\neffect must be given to all of the language so that provisions\n\nwhich appear to be conflicting or inconsistent may be reconciled\n\nand harmonized.\"     In re Halas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2022880\"><a href=\"/opinion/2022880/in-re-support-of-halas/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 964 (Ill. 1984).      We\n\nalso find the district court's analysis persuasive.7\n\n      As the district court concluded:\n\n\n\n7\n While the district court suggested that there was an ambiguity to\nresolve in this analysis, the district court also stated that the\nissue \"translated into a contractual interpretation argument\" and\nrequired no parol evidence.    Because a careful reading of the\ncontract itself resolved the issue, there was no need to resolve\nany ambiguity.\n\n                                      -21-\n\f              [I]t is clear [from the contract language]\n              that the parties intended Abbott to present an\n              [Annual Research Plan] prior to the start of\n              each Program Year that would include . . .\n              budgets for the remaining Program Years in the\n              Program Term. Thus, the parties intended that\n              the [Annual Research Plan] for 2003 would be\n              submitted to Hancock in 2002 and it would\n              include . . . budgets for 2003 and 2004. As a\n              result . . . Abbot's failure to demonstrate\n              its intent and reasonable expectation to\n              expend at least [the Aggregate Spending Target\n              by the end of] 2004 [] took place in 2002, not\n              2003.\n\n(Emphasis added.)       To hold otherwise, the district court reasoned,\n\nwould allow      Abbott \"to obtain two Program Payments (for 2002 and\n\n2003) for the price of one payment obligation termination.\" As the\n\ndistrict court emphasized, the contract gives Abbott one yearly\n\nHancock payment for each conforming year of Abbott's performance.\n\nThe contract would be subverted if Abbott could require an extra\n\npayment   by    Hancock   merely    because   it   was   late   in   submitting\n\ncomplete projections.\n\nD.   Waiver or estoppel\n\n       Abbott's final fallback argument is that Hancock waived the\n\nright to cancel its 2003 payment by waiting until the fall of 2003\n\nto   notify    Abbott   that   it   considered     its   payment     obligations\n\nterminated.      We agree with the district court that Hancock did\n\nnothing that could establish a waiver or estoppel under Illinois\n\nlaw.\n\n       In Illinois, waiver is the \"voluntary relinquishment of a\n\nknown right, claim, or privilege.\"            Vaughn v.

Abbott's waiver and estoppel arguments\n\nshare a common problem: they do not establish that Hancock conveyed\n\nany intention to relinquish a contractual \"right or privilege.\" We\n\ndiscuss    briefly    Abbot's      three   principal     waiver      and   estoppel\n\narguments, resolving them on this common ground.\n\n     Abbott first argues that Hancock should have made an earlier\n\nnotification that it planned to terminate its payments.                    However,\n\nthe contract does not contain any requirement that Hancock notify\n\nAbbott when a terminable event occurred.                 To the contrary, the\n\ncontract   states     that   \"Hancock's       entire    obligation     [under   the\n\ncontract] shall be limited to providing [its] program payments.\"\n\nFurther, the contract provides that \"[t]he waiver by either party\n\nhereto of any right hereunder or the failure to perform or of a\n\nbreach by the other party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other\n\nright hereunder . . ..\"            Hancock could not waive its right to\n\nterminate payments by failing to provide a notification that it was\n\nnot required to make.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\f       Abbott also contends that Hancock indicated that it was\n\nsatisfied with the December 2002 \"2003 Preliminary Annual Research\n\nPlan\" by tendering its 2002 payment upon receipt of that document,\n\nand that Abbott relied on that payment as an indication that the\n\nDecember 20, 2002 plan was sufficient.             But Hancock's payment for\n\n2002 could not have been any indication that Hancock considered the\n\n\"2003 Preliminary Annual Research Plan\" as compliant with Abbott's\n\nplanning obligations. Even if Hancock considered the plan a breach\n\nby Abbott, Hancock had no choice but to make its 2002 payment.\n\nAfter all, the contract provided that Hancock's payment \"for the\n\nProgram Year in which [an event that allows the termination of\n\npayments] occurs shall still be due and payable.\"                Abbott's breach\n\noccurred in 2002.        Hancock paid for 2002.      That is merely what the\n\ncontract required.\n\n       Abbott finally claims that Hancock forfeited its right to deem\n\nthe    December   2002    \"2003    Preliminary     Annual    Research    Plan\"   a\n\nterminable event by failing to make a timely request for a 2003\n\nAnnual Research Plan that included planned spending for 2004. This\n\nargument    represents      an    attempt    by   Abbott    to   shift   its   own\n\nresponsibilities to Hancock. The contract made it abundantly clear\n\nthat all responsibility for planning and funding rested with\n\nAbbott.    Hancock's only obligation was to provide large payments\n\nwhen    Abbott    submitted      conforming   documentation.         Given     this\n\narrangement, it was reasonable for both parties to accept the \"2003\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fPreliminary Annual Research Plan,\" submitted in December 2002, as\n\nAbbott's final word on the subject.             That December 2002 plan\n\nallowed Hancock to terminate its payments because it did not\n\nmanifest Abbott's intention to spend the contractually prescribed\n\namount   during   the   Program   Term   (and   because   any   request   for\n\nclarification of the document merely would have confirmed that\n\nAbbott did not intend to spend enough during the Program Term).\n\nHancock did not have to ask for clarification before it deemed the\n\nDecember 2002 Plan a breach by Abbott allowing it to terminate its\n\npayments.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f</pre>",
