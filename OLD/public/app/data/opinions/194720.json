The appellant,  Robert  G.  Beverly, was\n                \n\nconvicted,  after a  jury-waived  trial,  of  two  counts  of\n\nfailure to  file an  income tax return,  and three  counts of\n\nincome tax evasion.  We affirm the conviction.\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n     Beverly's principal argument on appeal concerns the fact\n\nthat he  represented  himself at  trial.   In  his  pre-trial\n\nappearances, Beverly twice stated that he wanted a lawyer and\n\nwas unable to  afford one.   He even filed  a motion  seeking\n\nappointed  counsel.   However,  a  week  after  he filed  the\n\nmotion, Beverly withdrew  it without explanation, and  on the\n\nfirst day  of trial he unequivocally stated  his intention to\n\ngo forward without a lawyer. \n\n     Beverly now argues that the district court \"was under an\n\nobligation  of  the  Constitution to  appoint  Assistance  of\n\nCounsel regardless of the defendants  [sic] financial status.\n\n. . .\"   This is incorrect.   The Criminal Justice  Act (CJA)\n\nrequires appointed  counsel only for  \"any person financially\n\nunable to obtain adequate representation. . . .\"  18 U.S.C.  \n\n3006A(a).   Although the CJA  requires the district  court to\n\nconduct an \"appropriate inquiry\" into the financial status of\n\na   defendant  who  seeks  appointed  counsel,  18  U.S.C.   \n\n3006A(b), the defendant bears the burden of proving financial\n\ninability. United  States v.  Harris, 707  F.2d 653, 660  (2d\n                                    \n\nCir. 1983) and cases cited therein.  \n\n                             -2-\n\n     Beverly appears  to  be arguing  (1)  that, had  he  not\n\nwithdrawn  his  motion  for  appointed counsel,  the  court's\n\n\"inquiry\" would have consisted of scrutinizing a standard CJA\n\napplication  and  affidavit  disclosing  Beverly's  financial\n\nstatus,  and (2)  that such  an inquiry  would not  have been\n\n\"appropriate\"  because it  would  have  required  Beverly  to\n\nsurrender  his  Fifth  Amendment  right  not  to  incriminate\n\nhimself in order to obtain  the protection of counsel due him\n\nunder the Sixth Amendment. \n\n     Some courts  have  recognized a  potential for  conflict\n\nbetween a criminal  defendant's Fifth Amendment right  not to\n\nincriminate  himself  and  his obligation  under  the  CJA to\n\ndemonstrate  that he  is unable  to pay  for a  lawyer.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v.  Gravatt, 868 F.2d 585, 589  (3d Cir. 1989);\n                         \n\nUnited States  v.

However,  even  these courts  have  not allowed  tax\n\ndefendants  to obtain  free  counsel regardless  of financial\n\nneed.   Rather,  they have  required  the defendants  to bear\n\ntheir  burden  of proof,  subject  to  either (1)  in  camera\n                                                             \n\ninspection  of  information  about  their  finances,  or  (2)\n\nassurances that  such information  will not  be used  against\n\nthem.

Krzyske, 836  F.2d 1013,  1018-19 (6th\n                              \n\nCir.  1988) (district  court not  required to hold  in camera\n                                                             \n\nhearing  where  defendant asserted  Fifth  Amendment rights);\n\nUnited States v. Peister, 631  F.2d 658, 662 (10th Cir. 1980)\n                        \n\n(district court not required to grant immunity where conflict\n\nwith Fifth Amendment is speculative and prospective only).\n\n     We do not  have to decide here whether  a district court\n\nmust  grant immunity  or hold  an  in camera  hearing when  a\n                                            \n\ncriminal  defendant asks for  appointed counsel but  raises a\n\nlegitimate Fifth Amendment concern about providing the needed\n\nfinancial  information,   because  Beverly   --  unlike   the\n\ndefendants in  the cases cited above  -- did not  even make a\n\n\"colorable assertion\"  to  the  district  court  that  public\n\ndisclosure  of his  financial information  would  violate his\n\nFifth Amendment rights.   Cf. United  States v. Gravatt,  868\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  at 588.   Beverly did tell  the court that  he wanted a\n\nlawyer  and could  not  afford one  that would  represent him\n\n\"properly,\"  but in his conversations with the district judge\n\nabout the issue of representation he never asserted his Fifth\n\n                             -4-\n\nAmendment  rights or attempted to explain how his response to\n\nthe standard CJA inquiries would compromise those rights.  He\n\nfiled   a  motion  for  appointed  counsel  but  provided  no\n\nfinancial information,  and then withdrew  the motion without\n\ncomment, and certainly without suggesting that he had done so\n\nin order to preserve his right not to incriminate himself.1\n\n     In sum, Beverly never suggested, much less demonstrated,\n\nto the district court that there was any real tension between\n\nhis  rights under  the Fifth  Amendment  and his  obligations\n\nunder the  CJA, and  hence never gave  the district  court an\n\nopportunity either to resolve such tension by allowing him to\n\nproduce evidence of his financial status subject to in camera\n                                                             \n\ninspection or a  grant of  immunity, or to  refuse to do  so.\n\nHis assertion on  appeal that he was put  to an impermissible\n\n\"choice\"   between    conflicting   constitutional    rights,\n\ntherefore,  is too speculative  to merit relief.   See United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Peister, 631 F.2d at 662.\n                 \n\n                    \n\n1.  Beverly's  statement to  Pre-Trial Services  that he  was\nearning $4,000 a  month, the fact that  he was able to  pay a\nlawyer  to represent him  during the IRS'  investigation, and\nthe evidence produced at trial that he owned two condominiums\nand a  boat, and  had earned more  than $60,000  in 1985  and\n1986,  and more  than $85,000  in 1987, all  suggest, rather,\nthat Beverly  withdrew the  motion because  he had  concluded\nthat he would not be able to convince the court to give him a\nfree  lawyer.   This  evidence also  suggests  that, had  the\ndistrict court reviewed Beverly's financial status (either in\n                                                             \ncamera  or after a grant  of immunity), it would nevertheless\n      \nhave concluded that he was  not entitled to appointed counsel\nunder the CJA.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     Nor do we  find any other suggestion in  the record that\n\nBeverly's decision to  forego counsel was less  than \"knowing\n\nand intelligent.\"   Beverly  argues that  the district  court\n\nshould  have followed  a prescribed  series  of questions  in\n\norder to ensure that the waiver was valid.  See United States\n                                                             \n\nv. McDowell, 814 F.2d 245, 250, 251-52 (6th Cir.  1987).  But\n           \n\nthis court  does not require  the district court to  \"issue a\n\nparticular warning or  make specific findings of  fact before\n\nit allows  a defendant to proceed pro  se.\"  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nHafen, 726 F.2d  21, 25 (1st Cir.  1984).  We have  said that\n     \n\nthe   district  court  can  allow  a  criminal  defendant  to\n\nrepresent himself if all of the information available to  the\n\ncourt  indicates that  the  defendant  (1)  understands  \"the\n\nmagnitude  of the undertaking and the 'disadvantages of self-\n\nrepresentation,'\"  (2) is  aware  \"that  there are  technical\n\nrules governing the conduct of a trial, and that presenting a\n\ndefense is not  a simple matter of telling  one's story,\" and\n\n(3) appreciates \"the  seriousness of  the charge  and of  the\n\npenalties  he may  be exposed  to before  deciding to  take a\n\nchance on his own skill.\"  Maynard v. Meachum, 545  F.2d 273,\n                                             \n\n279 (1st Cir. 1976).\n\n     Here,  on the  first day  of trial,  the district  judge\n\nquite  explicitly asked Beverly whether he understood that he\n\nhad a right to  a lawyer, and whether he chose nonetheless to\n\n\"go ahead without one,\" and Beverly quite explicitly answered\n\n                             -6-\n\nthat he  did.  By that time, moreover,  the court had, in one\n\npre-trial  hearing,  described  the  charges  to  Beverly  as\n\n\"serious,\" explained the  potential penalties, and  commented\n\non the  \"unique\" nature of  some of the motions  that Beverly\n\nhad  filed, and  had  heard  Beverly,  in  another  pre-trial\n\nhearing, acknowledge that he was  not an attorney and that he\n\ndid not  \"know all the procedures that this Court needs me to\n\nperform.\"  Although the process of review would be simplified\n\nif  the  district  court  would  engage in  a  more  extended\n\ncolloquy and give a more specific warning than was done here,\n\nand if it  would \"provide[] a short statement  of its reasons\n\nfor finding a defendant's waiver of counsel to be knowing and\n\nintelligent,\"  United States  v. Hafen,  726 F.2d  at 25,  we\n                                      \n\ncannot find, on the record before us, that the district court\n\nerred in allowing Beverly to represent himself at trial.\n\n                              II\n                                \n\n     Beverly's remaining  arguments do  not require  extended\n\ndiscussion.  \n\n     1. Beverly  contends that  the testimony  of IRS  agents\n\nconcerning  their interview with him in 1989 was inadmissible\n\nbecause Beverly had not been properly warned about his  Fifth\n\nAmendment  rights  before  the   interview  began.    Beverly\n\nconcedes  that  the  agents  advised  him  of  his rights  in\n\n\"absolute  accordance\"  with  IRS  procedures  for  so-called\n\n\"noncustodial\" interviews, but says that his interview was in\n\n                             -7-\n\nfact  \"custodial\" and therefore  required the agents  to give\n\nhim full-blown Miranda warnings.\n                      \n\n     \"In evaluating whether a suspect was in custody and thus\n\nentitled to Miranda warnings, we look to see, using objective\n                   \n\nstandards, whether there was a manifestation of a significant\n\ndeprivation  of  or  restraint on  the  suspect's  freedom of\n\nmovement,  taking into account  such factors as  'whether the\n\nsuspect  was questioned  in  familiar  or  at  least  neutral\n\nsurroundings, the number of law  enforcement officers present\n\nat  the scene, the  degree of physical  restraint placed upon\n\nthe   suspect,  and  the   duration  and  character   of  the\n\ninterrogation.'\"   United States v. Lanni, 951  F.2d 440, 442\n                                         \n\n(1st  Cir. 1991)  (citations  omitted).    Beverly,  who  was\n\nrepresented by  a lawyer  during the  IRS investigation,  was\n\ninterviewed at the lawyer's office, in the lawyer's presence,\n\nby two IRS agents.  There is nothing in the record to suggest\n\nthat the  agents physically  restrained Beverly  or gave  him\n\nreason  to  think  he  could  not   leave  or  terminate  the\n\ninterview.   The questioning  lasted,  according to  Beverly,\n\nonly three hours,  and we see no evidence  that the questions\n\nwere coercive in nature, or that the agents were  overbearing\n\nin manner.   In short, there  are no  indicia of a  custodial\n\ninterrogation, and  Beverly's protests  that he  nevertheless\n\nfelt  intimidated will  not avail  him, because  the  test of\n    \n\ncustody  is  objective:  \"the  only  relevant  inquiry  [with\n\n                             -8-\n\nrespect  to  whether a  person  was  in  custody for  Miranda\n                                                             \n\npurposes] is how  a reasonable man in  the suspect's position\n                              \n\nwould have understood  his situation.\"  Berkemer  v. McCarty,\n                                                            \n\n468 U.S. 420, 442 (1984).2\n\n     2.  Beverly  says   that  IRS  and   Justice  Department\n\nprocedures required the prosecutor in this case to obtain (a)\n\na Special Agent's Report, (b) a Criminal Referral Letter, (c)\n\na Prosecution  Report, and (d)  a signed Form 9131  before he\n\nwent to the grand jury for an indictment.  He claims that the\n\nprosecutor did not obtain these documents. \n\n     We may assume  the truth of these  premises because they\n\ndo not  support  Beverly's  conclusion:  that  the  resulting\n\nindictment  was flawed  and that  the  trial court  therefore\n\nlacked  jurisdiction to convict.  \"[A]n IRS agent's violation\n\nof a regulation of this sort does not prevent prosecution and\n\nconviction of a defendant. . .  .\"  United States v. Michaud,\n                                                            \n\n860 F.2d  495, 499 (1st  Cir. 1988).  The  procedures Beverly\n\ndescribes were not  required by statute or  the Constitution,\n\nnor  can Beverly  reasonably contend  that  he relied  on the\n\nprocedures,  or  that their  breach  had  any effect  on  his\n\nconduct.   United States  v.  Caceres, 440  U.S. 741,  749-53\n                                     \n\n(1979).  For  similar reasons, we hold  that even if the  IRS\n\n                    \n\n2.  Nor do  we  see  any  evidence that  the  agents  tricked\nBeverly into waiving  his Miranda rights.  Beverly  says that\n                                 \nthe IRS  agent who conducted  the interview told him  that he\nwas investigating the possibility of criminal violations, and\nthat appears to be exactly what the agent was doing.\n\n                             -9-\n\nviolated  the  Privacy  Act  by  failing  to  keep  Beverly's\n\nIndividual  Master File  up-to-date,  the delinquency  caused\n\nBeverly  no  prejudice  at  trial  and  does  not  affect the\n\nvalidity of his conviction.\n\n     3. The  district court did  not deprive  Beverly of  any\n\ndiscovery to which  he was entitled.  The government complied\n\nwith  the  district  court's   uniform  order  for  automatic\n\ndiscovery, and Beverly has  not shown us that the  prosecutor\n\nwithheld anything which  the order required him  to disclose,\n\nor that  he  found and  failed  to disclose  any  exculpatory\n\nmaterial.  Beverly's discovery motions ranged well beyond the\n\nscope of  Rule 16 and  were properly denied.   The prosecutor\n\ncomplied  with  the  Jencks  Act, 18  U.S.C.     3500(a),  by\n\nsupplying  witness statements and  reports to Beverly  on the\n\nmorning of trial.\n\n     4.

As to\n\nthe first group, 18 U.S.C.   4082(a) authorized the  Attorney\n\nGeneral  to take  custody,  because  the  repeal  of  Section\n\n4082(a) did not take  effect until November  1, 1987.

The appellant,  Robert  G.  Beverly, was\n                \n\nconvicted,  after a  jury-waived  trial,  of  two  counts  of\n\nfailure to  file an  income tax return,  and three  counts of\n\nincome tax evasion.  We affirm the conviction.\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n     Beverly's principal argument on appeal concerns the fact\n\nthat he  represented  himself at  trial.   In  his  pre-trial\n\nappearances, Beverly twice stated that he wanted a lawyer and\n\nwas unable to  afford one.   He even filed  a motion  seeking\n\nappointed  counsel.   However,  a  week  after  he filed  the\n\nmotion, Beverly withdrew  it without explanation, and  on the\n\nfirst day  of trial he unequivocally stated  his intention to\n\ngo forward without a lawyer. \n\n     Beverly now argues that the district court \"was under an\n\nobligation  of  the  Constitution to  appoint  Assistance  of\n\nCounsel regardless of the defendants  [sic] financial status.\n\n. . .\"   This is incorrect.   The Criminal Justice  Act (CJA)\n\nrequires appointed  counsel only for  \"any person financially\n\nunable to obtain adequate representation. . . .\"  18 U.S.C.  \n\n3006A(a).   Although the CJA  requires the district  court to\n\nconduct an \"appropriate inquiry\" into the financial status of\n\na   defendant  who  seeks  appointed  counsel,  18  U.S.C.   \n\n3006A(b), the defendant bears the burden of proving financial\n\ninability.

Cf. United  States v. Gravatt,  868\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  at 588.   Beverly did tell  the court that  he wanted a\n\nlawyer  and could  not  afford one  that would  represent him\n\n\"properly,\"  but in his conversations with the district judge\n\nabout the issue of representation he never asserted his Fifth\n\n                             -4-\n\nAmendment  rights or attempted to explain how his response to\n\nthe standard CJA inquiries would compromise those rights.  He\n\nfiled   a  motion  for  appointed  counsel  but  provided  no\n\nfinancial information,  and then withdrew  the motion without\n\ncomment, and certainly without suggesting that he had done so\n\nin order to preserve his right not to incriminate himself.1\n\n     In sum, Beverly never suggested, much less demonstrated,\n\nto the district court that there was any real tension between\n\nhis  rights under  the Fifth  Amendment  and his  obligations\n\nunder the  CJA, and  hence never gave  the district  court an\n\nopportunity either to resolve such tension by allowing him to\n\nproduce evidence of his financial status subject to in camera\n                                                             \n\ninspection or a  grant of  immunity, or to  refuse to do  so.\n\nHis assertion on  appeal that he was put  to an impermissible\n\n\"choice\"   between    conflicting   constitutional    rights,\n\ntherefore,  is too speculative  to merit relief.

Beverly's  statement to  Pre-Trial Services  that he  was\nearning $4,000 a  month, the fact that  he was able to  pay a\nlawyer  to represent him  during the IRS'  investigation, and\nthe evidence produced at trial that he owned two condominiums\nand a  boat, and  had earned more  than $60,000  in 1985  and\n1986,  and more  than $85,000  in 1987, all  suggest, rather,\nthat Beverly  withdrew the  motion because  he had  concluded\nthat he would not be able to convince the court to give him a\nfree  lawyer.   This  evidence also  suggests  that, had  the\ndistrict court reviewed Beverly's financial status (either in\n                                                             \ncamera  or after a grant  of immunity), it would nevertheless\n      \nhave concluded that he was  not entitled to appointed counsel\nunder the CJA.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     Nor do we  find any other suggestion in  the record that\n\nBeverly's decision to  forego counsel was less  than \"knowing\n\nand intelligent.\"   Beverly  argues that  the district  court\n\nshould  have followed  a prescribed  series  of questions  in\n\norder to ensure that the waiver was valid.

Beverly,  who  was\n\nrepresented by  a lawyer  during the  IRS investigation,  was\n\ninterviewed at the lawyer's office, in the lawyer's presence,\n\nby two IRS agents.  There is nothing in the record to suggest\n\nthat the  agents physically  restrained Beverly  or gave  him\n\nreason  to  think  he  could  not   leave  or  terminate  the\n\ninterview.   The questioning  lasted,  according to  Beverly,\n\nonly three hours,  and we see no evidence  that the questions\n\nwere coercive in nature, or that the agents were  overbearing\n\nin manner.   In short, there  are no  indicia of a  custodial\n\ninterrogation, and  Beverly's protests  that he  nevertheless\n\nfelt  intimidated will  not avail  him, because  the  test of\n    \n\ncustody  is  objective:  \"the  only  relevant  inquiry  [with\n\n                             -8-\n\nrespect  to  whether a  person  was  in  custody for  Miranda\n                                                             \n\npurposes] is how  a reasonable man in  the suspect's position\n                              \n\nwould have understood  his situation.\"  Berkemer  v.

Beverly  says   that  IRS  and   Justice  Department\n\nprocedures required the prosecutor in this case to obtain (a)\n\na Special Agent's Report, (b) a Criminal Referral Letter, (c)\n\na Prosecution  Report, and (d)  a signed Form 9131  before he\n\nwent to the grand jury for an indictment.  He claims that the\n\nprosecutor did not obtain these documents. \n\n     We may assume  the truth of these  premises because they\n\ndo not  support  Beverly's  conclusion:  that  the  resulting\n\nindictment  was flawed  and that  the  trial court  therefore\n\nlacked  jurisdiction to convict.  \"[A]n IRS agent's violation\n\nof a regulation of this sort does not prevent prosecution and\n\nconviction of a defendant. . .  .\"  United States v. Michaud,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513418\"><a href=\"/opinion/513418/united-states-v-hubert-michaud/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499 (1st  Cir. 1988).  The  procedures Beverly\n\ndescribes were not  required by statute or  the Constitution,\n\nnor  can Beverly  reasonably contend  that  he relied  on the\n\nprocedures,  or  that their  breach  had  any effect  on  his\n\nconduct.   United States  v.  Caceres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110049\"><a href=\"/opinion/110049/united-states-v-caceres/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  749-53\n                                     \n\n(1979).  For  similar reasons, we hold  that even if the  IRS\n\n                    \n\n2.  Nor do  we  see  any  evidence that  the  agents  tricked\nBeverly into waiving  his Miranda rights.  Beverly  says that\n                                 \nthe IRS  agent who conducted  the interview told him  that he\nwas investigating the possibility of criminal violations, and\nthat appears to be exactly what the agent was doing.\n\n                             -9-\n\nviolated  the  Privacy  Act  by  failing  to  keep  Beverly's\n\nIndividual  Master File  up-to-date,  the delinquency  caused\n\nBeverly  no  prejudice  at  trial  and  does  not  affect the\n\nvalidity of his conviction.\n\n     3. The  district court did  not deprive  Beverly of  any\n\ndiscovery to which  he was entitled.  The government complied\n\nwith  the  district  court's   uniform  order  for  automatic\n\ndiscovery, and Beverly has  not shown us that the  prosecutor\n\nwithheld anything which  the order required him  to disclose,\n\nor that  he  found and  failed  to disclose  any  exculpatory\n\nmaterial.  Beverly's discovery motions ranged well beyond the\n\nscope of  Rule 16 and  were properly denied.   The prosecutor\n\ncomplied  with  the  Jencks  Act, 18  U.S.C.     3500(a),  by\n\nsupplying  witness statements and  reports to Beverly  on the\n\nmorning of trial.\n\n     4. We see no merit in Beverly's  contention that neither\n\nthe Attorney  General nor the Bureau of Prisons had statutory\n\nauthority  to take  custody  of  him  after  his  conviction.\n\nBeverly  was convicted of five crimes, three committed before\n\nNovember 1,  1987, and two committed after  that date.  As to\n\nthe first group, 18 U.S.C.   4082(a) authorized the  Attorney\n\nGeneral  to take  custody,  because  the  repeal  of  Section\n\n4082(a) did not take  effect until November  1, 1987.  As  to\n\nthe  latter  group, 18  U.S.C.    3621(a)  --  which replaced\n\nSection  4082(a)  and  applies  to  crimes  committed   after\n\n                             -10-\n\nNovember 1, 1987 -- authorized  the Bureau of Prisons to take\n\ncustody.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -11-\n</pre>",
