Manuel Peña-Beltre, a native and\n\ncitizen of the Dominican Republic, petitions for review of a final\n\norder of removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).\n\nThe BIA upheld an Immigration Judge's (IJ) finding of removability\n\nand   denial     of   Peña-Beltre's     requests      for   (1)   removal    of   the\n\nconditions on his conditional lawful residence status and (2)\n\nvoluntary departure. Both the BIA and the IJ found Peña-Beltre had\n\nengaged    in    marriage   fraud     in    order   to   obtain   an   immigration\n\nbenefit.    We deny his petition.\n\n                                           I.\n\n            Peña-Beltre entered the United States without inspection\n\non or about September 1, 1996.             On January 25, 2001, he married a\n\nUnited States citizen, Vilma Toro-Berrios.                  Within two weeks, on\n\nFebruary 6, 2001, Peña-Beltre filed an application to adjust his\n\nstatus to that of lawful permanent resident on the basis that he\n\nand Toro-Berrios were married and lived together as husband and\n\nwife.\n\n            Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, an alien may\n\nreceive lawful permanent resident status by virtue of marriage to\n\na United States citizen.         8 U.S.C. § 1186a.           If the marriage is\n\nless than two years old when the alien receives permanent resident\n\nstatus,    the    grant   of   such   status     is   conditional.       8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1186a(1).      The alien and spouse must submit a second petition to\n\nremove the conditions, at which point the alien's lawful permanent\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fstatus may be terminated if the government finds that the marriage\n\nwas not bona fide.    8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c),(d).     If the conditions are\n\nnot removed within two-years, the alien's permanent resident status\n\nis terminated.   8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(3)(C).\n\n          On April 12, 2002, Peña-Beltre and Toro-Berrios appeared\n\nbefore   an   Immigration       and     Naturalization      Service    (INS)\n\nAdjudications Officer.       In separate sworn statements, they each\n\nclaimed that they had married for love and resided together as\n\nhusband and wife. The Officer granted Peña-Beltre lawful residence\n\non a conditional basis under 8 U.S.C. § 1186a.           On March 1, 2004,\n\nPeña-Beltre and Toro-Berrios filed an I-751 joint petition to\n\nremove the conditions on Peña-Beltre's lawful permanent residence.\n\nLike the sworn statements, the petition claimed that Peña-Beltre\n\nand Toro-Berrios lived together as husband and wife.\n\n          In response to the I-751 joint petition, on November 14,\n\n2005, Adjudication Officer Martin Garcia of the United States\n\nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) conducted separate\n\ninterviews with Peña-Beltre and Toro-Berrios to assess the bona\n\nfides of their marriage.1\n\n          Garcia     first   interviewed    Toro-Berrios.      When   Garcia\n\nconfronted Toro-Berrios with inconsistencies in her testimony, she\n\nadmitted that the marriage was fraudulent.        In both oral testimony\n\n\n\n     1\n          In the interim, USCIS and Immigration and                   Customs\nEnforcement had assumed the relevant duties of the INS.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fand a sworn statement, Toro-Berrios stated that she had never lived\n\nwith Peña-Beltre and that Peña-Beltre had offered her $2,000 to\n\nmarry him and had paid $500.       This confirmed a similar statement\n\nToro-Berrios made in a call to the INS on September 20, 2001, about\n\nseven    months   before    Peña-Beltre   received   lawful   conditional\n\npermanent resident status.2\n\n            Garcia   then     interviewed   Peña-Beltre.       He   found\n\ninconsistencies between Toro-Berrios' testimony and Peña-Beltre's.\n\nThey gave conflicting statements about the name of the person who\n\ntook Toro-Berrios' daughters to school, the year in which Toro-\n\nBerrios had last been employed, and the person who gave Toro-\n\nBerrios the necklace she was wearing. When Garcia confronted Peña-\n\nBeltre with Toro-Berrios' admission, Peña-Beltre stated that he did\n\nnot know why she had said this and suggested it might be a product\n\nof depression.\n\n            At the end of the interview, Garcia referred Peña-Beltre\n\nto Agent Juan Rivera of the Immigration and Custom Enforcement's\n\n(ICE) fraud division.       In conducting a pat down search of Peña-\n\nBeltre, Rivera discovered handwritten notes in his wallet.            The\n\nnotes appeared to be answers prepared in anticipation of questions\n\nabout the contents of their apartment, the patterns of their daily\n\n\n     2\n          In that call, Toro-Berrios informed an INS investigator\nthat her marriage with Peña-Beltre was fraudulent and that she did\nnot live with him.    She said that Peña-Beltre had promised her\n$2,000 in exchange for marriage, gave her $500, but would not give\nher the remainder of the money.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fliving, and the members of Toro-Berrios' family.             When Rivera\n\nconfronted Peña-Beltre with the notes, Peña-Beltre admitted that he\n\nhad not been living with Toro-Berrios for the past two years.\n\n            Peña-Beltre told Rivera that they had planned what to say\n\nduring the interview and gave a sworn statement that he married\n\nToro-Berrios to obtain an immigration benefit.         Peña-Beltre denied\n\nthat he and Toro-Berrios had an agreement whereby he would provide\n\nfinancial benefits to her in exchange for marriage.         He admitted,\n\nhowever, that an individual named Aladino Días arranged for him to\n\nmeet and marry Toro-Berrios in order to receive an immigration\n\nbenefit.    According to Peña-Beltre, the couple had lived together\n\nfor two years before separating.\n\n            At the conclusion of the interview, Rivera served Peña-\n\nBeltre with a Notice to Appear, which charged him with removability\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A) as an alien who sought to procure\n\nimmigration status by fraud or willful representation under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).    Shortly thereafter, USCIS denied Peña-\n\nBeltre's and Toro-Berrios' joint petition to remove the conditions\n\non his resident status.    On April 18, 2006, Peña-Beltre was served\n\nwith   an   additional   charge   of    removability    under   8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(1)(D)(i), as his permanent resident status had been\n\nterminated.\n\n            On April 11, 2006, Peña-Beltre filed a second I-751\n\npetition.     This petition requested a discretionary waiver of the\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fjoint petition requirements under 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B). Peña-\n\nBeltre claimed he was eligible for waiver because his marriage to\n\nToro-Berrios had been in good faith but ended in divorce.          With the\n\npetition, Peña-Beltre submitted an affidavit from Toro-Berrios.\n\nThe affidavit stated that their marriage was for love and that\n\ntheir divorce resulted from a deterioration of the relationship.\n\nOn February 28, 2007, USCIS denied this petition.\n\n          Before the IJ, Peña-Beltre conceded removability but\n\ndenied having committed marriage fraud.     He did not testify on his\n\nown behalf.   Instead, he presented testimony from three neighbors,\n\nwhose accounts of when they encountered Toro-Berrios near Peña-\n\nBeltre's apartment did not align.          The government introduced\n\ntestimony from immigration personnel, including Garcia and Rivera.\n\nWhen asked about a videotape of his interviews of November 14,\n\n2005, Garcia testified that it must have been misplaced.                The\n\ngovernment    also   presented   Toro-Berrios   as   a   witness   in   the\n\nexpectation that she would repeat her prior admissions of marriage\n\nfraud.\n\n          On the stand, however, Toro-Berrios did not make a\n\nsimilar admission. Initially she testified that she did not recall\n\nher November 14, 2005, interview with Garcia.        When the government\n\npresented Toro-Berrios' sworn statement from that interview, she\n\nclaimed that the statement was false and that Garcia had pressured\n\nher into making it. Toro-Berrios admitted that she had never lived\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fwith Peña-Beltre, but claimed that they had married for love.    She\n\nclaimed that they lived separately because her public housing\n\ndevelopment was safer for her children and did not permit illegal\n\naliens to live in the apartments.    According to Toro-Berrios, she\n\nspent some weekends at Peña-Beltre's apartment.\n\n          On further questioning, Toro-Berrios admitted that she\n\nhad been living with another man, Felix Garcia-Torres, the father\n\nof one of her children.    She first testified that Garcia-Torres\n\nmoved into her apartment in approximately September, 2005.      When\n\nthe government asked her if she had been living with Garcia-Torres\n\nduring the November 14, 2005, interview, Toro-Berrios recanted her\n\nearlier testimony and stated that Garcia-Torres did not move in\n\nwith her until after her divorce from Peña-Beltre.    In response to\n\nquestioning about the state of her relationship with Peña-Beltre at\n\nthe time of the interview on November 14, 2005, Toro-Berrios\n\ninvoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify further.\n\n          After she testified, the government introduced testimony\n\nabout a conference call the previous day in which Toro-Berrios\n\nallegedly admitted to the government's lawyer and an ICE agent that\n\nthe marriage was fraudulent.\n\n          The IJ denied relief, finding that Peña-Beltre and Toro-\n\nBerrios \"pretended to have a marital relationship.\"    The IJ found\n\nToro-Berrios not credible given the inconsistency of her statements\n\nbefore both the court and immigration officials.     The IJ found it\n\n\n                               -7-\n\frelevant that Peña-Beltre did not testify and found the testimony\n\nof his witnesses highly questionable given the tensions between\n\ntheir accounts.    Instead, the IJ credited the testimony of the\n\nimmigration   officials   who   conducted    the   November   14,   2005,\n\ninterviews.   Peña-Beltre's marriage fraud, the IJ held, rendered\n\nhim ineligible for his waiver petition and cast sufficient doubt\n\nupon his moral character to foreclose voluntary departure.\n\n           The BIA affirmed. It held that there was \"no evidence in\n\nthe record\" to support Peña-Beltre's claim that he married Toro-\n\nBerrios in good faith. The BIA credited the statements Peña-Beltre\n\nand Toro-Berrios signed at the interview of November 14, 2005,\n\nadmitting fraud. It deemed it significant that Peña-Beltre refused\n\nto testify and that Toro-Berrios invoked the Fifth Amendment when\n\nquestioned about her earlier statements.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           In his petition for review, Peña-Beltre makes three\n\nclaims.   First, he contests the IJ's finding, affirmed by the BIA,\n\nthat he committed marriage fraud.       Second, he claims that his due\n\nprocess rights were violated both when the IJ drew an adverse\n\ninference from Toro-Berrios' invocation of the Fifth Amendment and\n\nwhen the IJ did not require that the government produce a missing\n\nvideotape of the November 14, 2005, interview.        Third, he claims\n\nthat he was improperly denied voluntary departure.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f              This court reviews the BIA's decision as well as any\n\nportions of the IJ's opinion adopted by the BIA.                    Bonilla v.\n\nMukasey, 539 F.3d 72, 76 (1st Cir. 2008).                 We review the BIA's\n\nconclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact under the\n\ndeferential     substantial   evidence     standard.        Toribio-Chavez     v.\n\nHolder, 611 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 2010).                  We may reverse the\n\nagency's factual findings only if the petitioner shows that any\n\nreasonable fact finder would have concluded to the contrary.                  Syed\n\nv. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 248, 251 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              An alien spouse may remove the conditional basis of his\n\nlawful permanent status in one of two ways.              First, the alien and\n\nhis spouse may file a joint petition stating that the marriage is\n\nbona fide and has not been judicially annulled or terminated for\n\nreasons other than the death of a spouse.              8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(1).\n\nAfter filing, the couple may be required to appear for a personal\n\ninterview     concerning   the   facts   of   their     petition.    8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1186a(c)(1)(B). In removal proceedings, the government bears the\n\nburden   of    showing   marriage   fraud     by   a    preponderance    of    the\n\nevidence.     8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(3)(D).\n\n              Second, the alien may request a discretionary waiver of\n\nthe joint filing requirement if he shows that at least one of three\n\nconditions obtains.        8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4).           The condition at\n\nissue here allows waiver if the marriage was entered into in good\n\nfaith, the marriage was terminated for reasons other than death,\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fand the alien was not at fault for failing to meet the joint\n\npetition and interview requirements.    8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B).\n\nThe alien bears the burden of showing that he qualifies for a\n\ndiscretionary waiver under this provision.\n\n           For Peña-Beltre, both paths to lawful resident status\n\nrequire a showing that his marriage to Toro-Berrios was bona fide.\n\nAny difference as to burdens is not material to this case.    Here,\n\nthe evidence of marriage fraud is so overwhelming that it hardly\n\nneeds detailing.    The government has more than met its burden of\n\nproof.   We rest on the BIA's and IJ's conclusions, which are amply\n\nsupported by the evidence we have described.\n\n           Peña-Beltre's purported due process claims fail.      He\n\nbrings both claims for the first time in this court.   Because Peña-\n\nBeltre could have but did not raise these claims before the BIA, we\n\nlack jurisdiction over them. Bollanos v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 82, 87\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).3\n\n           Peña-Beltre's request for voluntary departure also fails\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction. Peña-Beltre claims that the BIA erred in\n\n\n     3\n          These claims are not even colorable. The IJ did not err\nin drawing an adverse inference from Toro-Berrios' choice to invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment. Adverse inferences may be drawn from silence\nin removal hearings. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1043-44\n(1984).   Nor did the IJ err in not requiring the government to\nproduce the missing videotape.    In deportation proceedings, due\nprocess requires that an alien not be prevented from reasonably\npresenting his case. Orehhova v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 48, 52 (1st\nCir. 2005).    Here, Peña-Beltre had ample opportunity to cross-\nexamine the government's witnesses, provide his own testimony, and\nintroduce other testimony to challenge the government's claims.\n\n                                -10-\n\faffirming the IJ's finding that he was ineligible for voluntary\n\ndeparture    because   he    was   not,   as   required   by   8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229c(b)(1)(B), a person of \"good moral character\" for the\n\npreceding five years.       Peña-Beltre claims that he did not commit\n\nmarriage fraud, and that the IJ therefore abused her discretion in\n\ndenying his request.        This court has no jurisdiction to review\n\ndenials of voluntary departure.       8 U.S.C. § 1229c(f); Hussain v.\n\nHolder, 576 F.3d 54, 58-59 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n            The petition is denied.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

On March 1, 2004,\n\nPeña-Beltre and Toro-Berrios filed an I-751 joint petition to\n\nremove the conditions on Peña-Beltre's lawful permanent residence.\n\nLike the sworn statements, the petition claimed that Peña-Beltre\n\nand Toro-Berrios lived together as husband and wife.\n\n          In response to the I-751 joint petition, on November 14,\n\n2005, Adjudication Officer Martin Garcia of the United States\n\nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) conducted separate\n\ninterviews with Peña-Beltre and Toro-Berrios to assess the bona\n\nfides of their marriage.1\n\n          Garcia     first   interviewed    Toro-Berrios.      When   Garcia\n\nconfronted Toro-Berrios with inconsistencies in her testimony, she\n\nadmitted that the marriage was fraudulent.        In both oral testimony\n\n\n\n     1\n          In the interim, USCIS and Immigration and                   Customs\nEnforcement had assumed the relevant duties of the INS.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fand a sworn statement, Toro-Berrios stated that she had never lived\n\nwith Peña-Beltre and that Peña-Beltre had offered her $2,000 to\n\nmarry him and had paid $500.       This confirmed a similar statement\n\nToro-Berrios made in a call to the INS on September 20, 2001, about\n\nseven    months   before    Peña-Beltre   received   lawful   conditional\n\npermanent resident status.2\n\n            Garcia   then     interviewed   Peña-Beltre.       He   found\n\ninconsistencies between Toro-Berrios' testimony and Peña-Beltre's.\n\nThey gave conflicting statements about the name of the person who\n\ntook Toro-Berrios' daughters to school, the year in which Toro-\n\nBerrios had last been employed, and the person who gave Toro-\n\nBerrios the necklace she was wearing. When Garcia confronted Peña-\n\nBeltre with Toro-Berrios' admission, Peña-Beltre stated that he did\n\nnot know why she had said this and suggested it might be a product\n\nof depression.\n\n            At the end of the interview, Garcia referred Peña-Beltre\n\nto Agent Juan Rivera of the Immigration and Custom Enforcement's\n\n(ICE) fraud division.       In conducting a pat down search of Peña-\n\nBeltre, Rivera discovered handwritten notes in his wallet.            The\n\nnotes appeared to be answers prepared in anticipation of questions\n\nabout the contents of their apartment, the patterns of their daily\n\n\n     2\n          In that call, Toro-Berrios informed an INS investigator\nthat her marriage with Peña-Beltre was fraudulent and that she did\nnot live with him.    She said that Peña-Beltre had promised her\n$2,000 in exchange for marriage, gave her $500, but would not give\nher the remainder of the money.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fliving, and the members of Toro-Berrios' family.             When Rivera\n\nconfronted Peña-Beltre with the notes, Peña-Beltre admitted that he\n\nhad not been living with Toro-Berrios for the past two years.\n\n            Peña-Beltre told Rivera that they had planned what to say\n\nduring the interview and gave a sworn statement that he married\n\nToro-Berrios to obtain an immigration benefit.         Peña-Beltre denied\n\nthat he and Toro-Berrios had an agreement whereby he would provide\n\nfinancial benefits to her in exchange for marriage.         He admitted,\n\nhowever, that an individual named Aladino Días arranged for him to\n\nmeet and marry Toro-Berrios in order to receive an immigration\n\nbenefit.    According to Peña-Beltre, the couple had lived together\n\nfor two years before separating.\n\n            At the conclusion of the interview, Rivera served Peña-\n\nBeltre with a Notice to Appear, which charged him with removability\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A) as an alien who sought to procure\n\nimmigration status by fraud or willful representation under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).    Shortly thereafter, USCIS denied Peña-\n\nBeltre's and Toro-Berrios' joint petition to remove the conditions\n\non his resident status.    On April 18, 2006, Peña-Beltre was served\n\nwith   an   additional   charge   of    removability    under   8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(1)(D)(i), as his permanent resident status had been\n\nterminated.\n\n            On April 11, 2006, Peña-Beltre filed a second I-751\n\npetition.     This petition requested a discretionary waiver of the\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fjoint petition requirements under 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B). Peña-\n\nBeltre claimed he was eligible for waiver because his marriage to\n\nToro-Berrios had been in good faith but ended in divorce.          With the\n\npetition, Peña-Beltre submitted an affidavit from Toro-Berrios.\n\nThe affidavit stated that their marriage was for love and that\n\ntheir divorce resulted from a deterioration of the relationship.\n\nOn February 28, 2007, USCIS denied this petition.\n\n          Before the IJ, Peña-Beltre conceded removability but\n\ndenied having committed marriage fraud.     He did not testify on his\n\nown behalf.   Instead, he presented testimony from three neighbors,\n\nwhose accounts of when they encountered Toro-Berrios near Peña-\n\nBeltre's apartment did not align.          The government introduced\n\ntestimony from immigration personnel, including Garcia and Rivera.\n\nWhen asked about a videotape of his interviews of November 14,\n\n2005, Garcia testified that it must have been misplaced.                The\n\ngovernment    also   presented   Toro-Berrios   as   a   witness   in   the\n\nexpectation that she would repeat her prior admissions of marriage\n\nfraud.\n\n          On the stand, however, Toro-Berrios did not make a\n\nsimilar admission. Initially she testified that she did not recall\n\nher November 14, 2005, interview with Garcia.        When the government\n\npresented Toro-Berrios' sworn statement from that interview, she\n\nclaimed that the statement was false and that Garcia had pressured\n\nher into making it. Toro-Berrios admitted that she had never lived\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fwith Peña-Beltre, but claimed that they had married for love.    She\n\nclaimed that they lived separately because her public housing\n\ndevelopment was safer for her children and did not permit illegal\n\naliens to live in the apartments.    According to Toro-Berrios, she\n\nspent some weekends at Peña-Beltre's apartment.\n\n          On further questioning, Toro-Berrios admitted that she\n\nhad been living with another man, Felix Garcia-Torres, the father\n\nof one of her children.    She first testified that Garcia-Torres\n\nmoved into her apartment in approximately September, 2005.      When\n\nthe government asked her if she had been living with Garcia-Torres\n\nduring the November 14, 2005, interview, Toro-Berrios recanted her\n\nearlier testimony and stated that Garcia-Torres did not move in\n\nwith her until after her divorce from Peña-Beltre.    In response to\n\nquestioning about the state of her relationship with Peña-Beltre at\n\nthe time of the interview on November 14, 2005, Toro-Berrios\n\ninvoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify further.\n\n          After she testified, the government introduced testimony\n\nabout a conference call the previous day in which Toro-Berrios\n\nallegedly admitted to the government's lawyer and an ICE agent that\n\nthe marriage was fraudulent.\n\n          The IJ denied relief, finding that Peña-Beltre and Toro-\n\nBerrios \"pretended to have a marital relationship.\"    The IJ found\n\nToro-Berrios not credible given the inconsistency of her statements\n\nbefore both the court and immigration officials.     The IJ found it\n\n\n                               -7-\n\frelevant that Peña-Beltre did not testify and found the testimony\n\nof his witnesses highly questionable given the tensions between\n\ntheir accounts.    Instead, the IJ credited the testimony of the\n\nimmigration   officials   who   conducted    the   November   14,   2005,\n\ninterviews.   Peña-Beltre's marriage fraud, the IJ held, rendered\n\nhim ineligible for his waiver petition and cast sufficient doubt\n\nupon his moral character to foreclose voluntary departure.\n\n           The BIA affirmed. It held that there was \"no evidence in\n\nthe record\" to support Peña-Beltre's claim that he married Toro-\n\nBerrios in good faith. The BIA credited the statements Peña-Beltre\n\nand Toro-Berrios signed at the interview of November 14, 2005,\n\nadmitting fraud. It deemed it significant that Peña-Beltre refused\n\nto testify and that Toro-Berrios invoked the Fifth Amendment when\n\nquestioned about her earlier statements.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           In his petition for review, Peña-Beltre makes three\n\nclaims.   First, he contests the IJ's finding, affirmed by the BIA,\n\nthat he committed marriage fraud.       Second, he claims that his due\n\nprocess rights were violated both when the IJ drew an adverse\n\ninference from Toro-Berrios' invocation of the Fifth Amendment and\n\nwhen the IJ did not require that the government produce a missing\n\nvideotape of the November 14, 2005, interview.        Third, he claims\n\nthat he was improperly denied voluntary departure.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f              This court reviews the BIA's decision as well as any\n\nportions of the IJ's opinion adopted by the BIA.

First, the alien and\n\nhis spouse may file a joint petition stating that the marriage is\n\nbona fide and has not been judicially annulled or terminated for\n\nreasons other than the death of a spouse.              8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(1).\n\nAfter filing, the couple may be required to appear for a personal\n\ninterview     concerning   the   facts   of   their     petition.    8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1186a(c)(1)(B). In removal proceedings, the government bears the\n\nburden   of    showing   marriage   fraud     by   a    preponderance    of    the\n\nevidence.     8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(3)(D).\n\n              Second, the alien may request a discretionary waiver of\n\nthe joint filing requirement if he shows that at least one of three\n\nconditions obtains.        8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4).           The condition at\n\nissue here allows waiver if the marriage was entered into in good\n\nfaith, the marriage was terminated for reasons other than death,\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fand the alien was not at fault for failing to meet the joint\n\npetition and interview requirements.    8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B).\n\nThe alien bears the burden of showing that he qualifies for a\n\ndiscretionary waiver under this provision.\n\n           For Peña-Beltre, both paths to lawful resident status\n\nrequire a showing that his marriage to Toro-Berrios was bona fide.\n\nAny difference as to burdens is not material to this case.    Here,\n\nthe evidence of marriage fraud is so overwhelming that it hardly\n\nneeds detailing.    The government has more than met its burden of\n\nproof.   We rest on the BIA's and IJ's conclusions, which are amply\n\nsupported by the evidence we have described.\n\n           Peña-Beltre's purported due process claims fail.      He\n\nbrings both claims for the first time in this court.   Because Peña-\n\nBeltre could have but did not raise these claims before the BIA, we\n\nlack jurisdiction over them. Bollanos v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202386\"><a href=\"/opinion/202386/bollanos-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).3\n\n           Peña-Beltre's request for voluntary departure also fails\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction. Peña-Beltre claims that the BIA erred in\n\n\n     3\n          These claims are not even colorable. The IJ did not err\nin drawing an adverse inference from Toro-Berrios' choice to invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment. Adverse inferences may be drawn from silence\nin removal hearings. INS v.

Here, Peña-Beltre had ample opportunity to cross-\nexamine the government's witnesses, provide his own testimony, and\nintroduce other testimony to challenge the government's claims.\n\n                                -10-\n\faffirming the IJ's finding that he was ineligible for voluntary\n\ndeparture    because   he    was   not,   as   required   by   8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229c(b)(1)(B), a person of \"good moral character\" for the\n\npreceding five years.
