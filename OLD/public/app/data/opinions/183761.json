Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Torruella, Stahl and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Keven A.

Plaintiff Keven McKenna appeals from an\n\norder dismissing his federal court action under the so-called\n\nYounger doctrine.           See Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971)\n\n(requiring district courts to stay or dismiss a federal action in\n\nfavor    of   continued     prosecution   of   related   state   litigation).\n\nDefendants Sandra Powell, director of the Rhode Island Department\n\nof Labor and Training, and George Healy, chief judge of the Rhode\n\nIsland Workers Compensation Court, contend that dismissal was\n\nrequired in light of ongoing state judicial proceedings.\n\n              Having read the briefs and record with care, we think\n\nthis case is a paradigm for Younger abstention.            We see no reason\n\nto   expand    upon   the    magistrate   judge's   thoughtful    report   and\n\nrecommendation, McKenna v. Powell, No. 10-017, 2010 WL 2474037\n\n(D.R.I.

Banco Popular de P.R., 560 F.3d 14,\n\n15 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"We consistently have espoused the view that\n\nwhen a lower court accurately takes the measure of a case, applies\n\nthe correct legal rules, and articulates a convincing rationale,\n\n'an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no\n\nother end than to hear its own words resonate.'\" (quoting Lawton v.\n\nState Mut.
