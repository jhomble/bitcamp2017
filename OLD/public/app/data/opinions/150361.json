Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Johannes Hakim (\"Hakim\") seeks\n\nreview of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\nreversing the grant of applications for asylum under Section 208 of\n\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") and for withholding of\n\nremoval under Section 241(b)(3) of the INA.           Hakim contends that\n\nthe BIA erred when it determined that evidence of mistreatment he\n\nexperienced in his native Indonesia failed to rise to the level of\n\npersecution within the meaning of the immigration laws.                   The\n\ngovernment counters that we lack jurisdiction because we have not\n\nbeen   presented   with   a   final   order   of   removal,   and,   in   the\n\nalternative, that the Attorney General's issuance of a final rule\n\non voluntary departure militates in favor of not finding a final\n\norder of removal. After careful consideration, we decline for\n\nprudential reasons to exercise jurisdiction in this case.            Hakim's\n\npetition is thus dismissed without prejudice.\n\n                              I.   Background\n\n           A.   Facts1\n\n           Hakim is an Indonesian citizen of Chinese ethnicity and\n\nChristian faith.     In February of 1996, Hakim, who was fourteen\n\nyears old at the time, was attacked by \"a group of people\" who\n\nidentified him as Chinese and robbed him.           One of the men struck\n\nHakim with a block of wood, breaking his hand.         Neither he nor his\n\n\n1\n  These facts are drawn from the petitioner's testimony before the\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\"), which the IJ deemed \"convincing[].\" See\nDecky v. Holder, 587 F.3d 104, 107 n.2 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fparents reported the incident to the police, considering it a\n\n\"waste\" to file a report because the police would see that they\n\nwere Chinese and would probably then ask them for money.                      Although\n\nHakim testified as to other events, the February 1996 incident was,\n\naccording to him, \"the worst thing that happened\" to him.\n\n           Hakim left Indonesia in 2001 and, the following year,\n\napplied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").\n\n           B.    Procedural History\n\n           Hakim left Indonesia on September 26, 2001. The next day\n\nhe was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant B2 Visitor\n\nfor Pleasure with authorization to remain in the United States for\n\na temporary period not to exceed March 24, 2002.                    He overstayed,\n\nand on September 24, 2002, Hakim submitted applications for asylum,\n\nwithholding     of   removal,      and   protection     under   the   CAT      to   the\n\nImmigration     and        Naturalization      Service     (\"INS\").           Hakim's\n\napplication was referred to the Immigration Court in Boston,\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n           On August 5, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security\n\n(\"DHS\") commenced removal proceedings against Hakim by filing a\n\nNotice to Appear (\"NTA\") with the Immigration Court alleging he had\n\nremained   in   the    United      States    after    March   24,   2002,     without\n\nauthorization,       and     was   subject     to    removal.       See   8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(1)(B).      Hakim admitted the allegations contained in the\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fNTA, conceded that he was removable, and renewed his requests for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n           Hakim testified before the IJ on August 3, 2006, and, on\n\nFebruary   5,    2007,    the    IJ     issued    a    decision      granting      his\n\napplications    for    asylum    and    withholding     of    removal.       The     IJ\n\nconcluded that the evidence presented by Hakim warranted a finding\n\nthat he suffered past persecution in Indonesia.                Given the finding\n\nof past persecution and the DHS's inability to provide evidence\n\nthat conditions in Indonesia had changed, the IJ held that the\n\ngovernment had failed to meet its burden of proving that Hakim's\n\nfears of future persecution were not well-founded.                   See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13(b)(1) (stating that once the applicant has demonstrated\n\npast   persecution,      DHS    has    the    burden   of     establishing      by    a\n\npreponderance of the evidence either \"a fundamental change in\n\ncircumstances\"    or     the    possibility       of    internal      relocation).\n\nHowever, because Hakim \"failed to establish he would be detained\n\nand subject to torture or that the government of Indonesia would\n\nacquiesce in that harm being inflicted upon him[,]\" the IJ denied\n\nhim protection under the CAT.\n\n           The government appealed to the BIA, which issued an\n\nopinion on April 24, 2009, reversing the IJ's grant of applications\n\nfor asylum and for withholding of removal.                  The BIA rejected the\n\nIJ's conclusion that Hakim had established that he was a victim of\n\npast   persecution.       The    BIA    explained      that    the    mistreatment\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\finflicted     on        Hakim     in     the        February        1996        robbery      was\n\n\"reprehensible,\"         but    fell    \"outside          the   scope      of   the   type    of\n\nmistreatment considered to be persecution,\" and that \"the other\n\nincidents of which he complained were [not] sufficiently severe,\n\neither cumulatively or in isolation, [nor] sufficiently related to\n\nan enumerated ground, to constitute persecution.\"2\n\n             Concluding         that    Hakim       had    failed     to    establish       past\n\npersecution, the BIA disagreed with the IJ's conclusion that he\n\nshould benefit from a presumption of future persecution.                                The BIA\n\nfound that Hakim \"did not persuasively articulate any specific\n\nbasis   on   which       he     would    be     likely      to   be     singled       out    for\n\npersecution[,]\" and there was insufficient evidence \"to support a\n\nconclusion that there is a pattern and practice of persecution\n\nagainst Christians or ethnically Chinese individuals in Indonesia.\"\n\nSee also Decky, 587 F.3d at 113 (\"We have repeatedly affirmed the\n\nBIA's determinations . . . that there is no ongoing pattern or\n\npractice of persecution against ethnic Chinese or Christians in\n\nIndonesia.\") (citation omitted).                     The BIA also held that Hakim\n\nfailed to present evidence demonstrating that he would not be able\n\nto   relocate      to     another       part        of    Indonesia.            Given     these\n\n\n2\n   In a claim for asylum, \"the petitioner carries the burden of\nproving that he qualifies as a refugee by showing either that he\nhas suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future\npersecution on the basis of 'race, religion, nationality,\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.'\"\nJournal v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting 8\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)).\n\n                                              -5-\n\fdeterminations, the BIA concluded that Hakim failed to prove that\n\nhe   should      be   granted   asylum,    and    thus   the    more   stringent\n\nwithholding of removal. As the IJ had not considered whether Hakim\n\nwas eligible for voluntary departure, the BIA remanded the case to\n\nthe IJ to make such a determination.\n\n            The IJ scheduled for January 14, 2010, a hearing to\n\ndetermine     Hakim's     eligibility     for    voluntary     departure.    On\n\nDecember 31, 2009, Hakim filed a motion for continuance before the\n\nIJ, which was granted on January 5, 2010.            The IJ thus rescheduled\n\nthe hearing date for July 22, 2010.           Hakim currently seeks, in this\n\nCourt, reversal of the BIA's decision on the merits.\n\n                                II. Discussion\n\n            A.    Standard/Scope of Review\n\n            Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d), we have jurisdiction to\n\nreview final orders of removal only if both of the following\n\nconditions are met.        First, \"the alien [must have] exhausted all\n\nadministrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\"                  8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(d)(1); see De Araujo v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 146, 152\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (\"This exhaustion requirement generally means that\n\nthe BIA must first review an IJ's determination of [removability]\n\nbefore a petitioner may present his appeal to us.\") (citation\n\nomitted).     Second,\n\n            another court        [cannot have] decided the\n            validity of the       order, unless the reviewing\n            court finds that     the petition presents grounds\n            that could not       have been presented in the\n\n                                        -6-\n\f             prior judicial proceedings or that the remedy\n             provided   by   the   prior   proceeding   was\n             inadequate or ineffective to test the validity\n             of the order.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(2).       That is, we lack jurisdiction to consider\n\na   petition    raising   arguments   that    a   court   has   previously\n\n\"considered and rejected\" in a prior proceeding.          Paul v. United\n\nStates Dep't of Justice, 273 F. App'x 64, 65 (2d Cir. 2008); see\n\nGittens v. Menifee, 428 F.3d 382, 386 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that\n\nan alien's second petition for review would fail under § 1252(d)(2)\n\nwhen \"a federal court has already ruled on the merits of his . . .\n\nargument\").\n\n             The INA defines an \"order of [removal]\" as \"the order of\n\nthe special inquiry officer, or other such administrative officer\n\nto whom the Attorney General has delegated the responsibility for\n\ndetermining whether an alien is [removable], concluding that the\n\nalien   is     [removable]   or   ordering    [removal].\"3      8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(47)(A) (emphasis added).        Orders of removal become final\n\nupon \"(I) a determination by the [BIA] affirming such an order; or\n\n(ii) the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted\n\nto seek review of such order by the [BIA,]\" whichever is earlier.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47)(B).\n\n\n\n3\n  See Calcano-Martínez v. INS, 533 U.S. 348, 350 n.1 (2001)(noting\nthat, in 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and\nImmigrant Responsibility Act, which replaced the term \"deportation\"\nwith \"removal\"). The definitions section of the INA has not been\nrevised to incorporate this change.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f            Without directly addressing 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47), Hakim\n\nargues that the BIA's order remanding to the IJ to resolve the\n\nquestion of voluntary departure constitutes a final order of\n\nremoval.    He contends that, according to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1), we\n\nhave jurisdiction because he has exhausted all administrative\n\nremedies in pursuit of his applications for asylum and withholding\n\nof removal, and another court has not decided the validity of the\n\norder.      Furthermore,      he    contends    that    the   only    issue    being\n\nconsidered on remand by the IJ is his eligibility for voluntary\n\ndeparture, not further review of his asylum or withholding of\n\nremoval applications.         In support of his argument, Hakim relies on\n\na number of sister circuit cases, including Alibasic v. Mukasey, in\n\nwhich the Second Circuit held that \"a BIA order denying relief from\n\nremoval and remanding for the sole purpose of considering voluntary\n\ndeparture    is   a   final    order    of    removal   that    this       Court   has\n\njurisdiction to review.\"           547 F.3d 78, 83-84 (2d Cir. 2008) (\"The\n\nIJ's underlying finding of removability based on [the alien's]\n\nconcessions [of removability] still stands and . . . the BIA has\n\nsimply removed an impediment to the removal that was ordered by the\n\nIJ.\") (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Saldarriaga v.\n\nGonzales, 402 F.3d 461, 466 n.2 (4th Cir. 2005) (\"[A] BIA order\n\ndenying    relief     from   deportation,      but   remanding       the    case   for\n\nvoluntary departure proceedings or other subsidiary determinations\"\n\nis a final order of removal that is \"immediately appealable.\"); Del\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fPilar v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 326 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir. 2003) (per\n\ncuriam) (finding that \"the BIA's remand for the limited purpose of\n\npermitting   [petitioner]   to    designate   a   country   of   removal\"\n\nconstituted a final order of removal); Castrejón-García v. INS, 60\n\nF.3d 1359, 1361-62 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding that the BIA's order\n\nreversing the grant of suspension and remanding to the IJ for a\n\ndetermination of voluntary departure was a final order of removal);\n\nPerkovic v. INS, 33 F.3d 616, 619 (6th Cir. 1994) (\"We are aware of\n\nno authority for the proposition that a [BIA] order rejecting an\n\nasylum application is not a final order unless a formal order of\n\ndeportation has already been issued.\").\n\n          Despite the IJ having awarded asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval to Hakim, the government argues that the IJ did not issue\n\nan order of removal, but merely noted that Hakim had conceded that\n\nhe was removable.   But see Chupina v. Holder, 570 F.3d 99, 104 (2d\n\nCir. 2009) (\"[A]n award of withholding of removal requires entry of\n\nan underlying 'order of removal.'\") (citation omitted).               The\n\ngovernment further argues that the Attorney General's issuance in\n\n2008 of a final rule amending the regulation regarding voluntary\n\ndeparture militates in favor of finding that the BIA did not issue\n\na final order of removal.        See Voluntary Departure: Effect of a\n\nMotion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed.\n\nReg. 76,927, 76,937 (Dec. 18, 2008) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R.\n\n§§ 1240-1241, as relevant 1240.26(i)).        Under that new voluntary\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fdeparture regulation, effective as of January 20, 2009, \"any grant\n\nof voluntary departure shall terminate automatically upon the\n\nfiling of the petition [for review] and the alternate order of\n\nremoval[, which shall be entered upon granting a request made for\n\nvoluntary departure,] . . . shall immediately take effect.\"       8\n\nC.F.R. § 1240.26(d), (i).    The decisions of our sister circuits --\n\nfinding that a BIA order denying relief from removal and remanding\n\nfor voluntary departure is a final order of removal -- were issued\n\nbefore this current voluntary departure regulation, and thus did\n\nnot take it into consideration.\n\n          B.     Voluntary Departure\n\n          Voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief.\n\nChi v. Holder, --- F.3d ---, 2010 WL 2089478 at *1 (1st Cir.\n\nMay 26, 2010).    Voluntary departure is available (1) in lieu of or\n\nprior to the completion of removal proceedings or (2) at the\n\nconclusion of removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1).\n\nAn IJ may grant voluntary departure at the conclusion of a removal\n\nproceeding if she finds that: (i) \"[t]he alien has been physically\n\npresent in the United States for [a] period of at least one year\n\npreceding the date the [NTA] was served\"; (ii) \"[t]he alien is, and\n\nhas been, a person of good moral character for at least five years\n\nimmediately preceding the application\"; (iii) \"[t]he alien has not\n\nbeen convicted of [an aggravated felony] and is not deportable [on\n\nsecurity grounds]\"; and (iv) \"[t]he alien has established by clear\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fand convincing evidence that the alien has the means to depart the\n\nUnited   States   and   has   the   intention    to   do    so.\"   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 1240.26(c)(1).    The Supreme Court has described this relief as\n\n           an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like\n           a settlement agreement.    In return for the\n           anticipated benefit, including the possibility\n           of   readmission,   an  alien   who   requests\n           voluntary departure represents that he or she\n           \"has the means to depart the United States and\n           intends to do so\" promptly.    Included among\n           the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien\n           when selecting voluntary departure is the\n           obligation to arrange for departure, and\n           actually depart, within the 60-day period.\n\nDada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1, 32 (2008) (citations omitted).\n\n           The Supreme Court has not resolved the issue of whether\n\nthe federal courts of appeals have the authority to grant a motion\n\nto stay the voluntary departure period pending consideration of a\n\npetition for review on the merits.         See id. at 18.    Our circuit has\n\nheld that we have the authority \"to suspend the running of an\n\nunexpired voluntary departure period while a petition for judicial\n\nreview is pending[,]\" Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 268 (1st\n\nCir. 2005), and while several of our sister circuits are in accord,\n\nat least one disagrees.       Compare Thapa v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 323,\n\n332 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding that the court may stay voluntary\n\ndeparture pending consideration of a petition for review on the\n\nmerits), Obale v. Ashcroft, 453 F.3d 151, 157 (3d Cir. 2006)\n\n(same), Lopez-Chavez v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 650, 654 (7th Cir. 2004)\n\n(same), Rife v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 606, 616 (8th Cir. 2004) (same),\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fNwakanma v. Ashcroft, 352 F.3d 325, 427 (6th Cir. 2003) (same), and\n\nHimri v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1261, 1262 (9th Cir. 2003) (same), with\n\nNgarurih v. Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 182, 194 (4th Cir. 2006) (finding\n\nthat the court may not stay the voluntary departure period pending\n\nconsideration of a petition for review).        In response to the\n\ndivergent federal practice and pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(e), the\n\nAttorney General subsequently issued a final rule on December 18,\n\n2008.   See Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or\n\nReconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed. Reg. at 76,937-38.\n\nThat rule amended the voluntary departure regulation, which now, in\n\npart, provides that a grant of voluntary departure on or after\n\nJanuary 20, 2009, automatically terminates with the filing of a\n\npetition for review.   8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).\n\n          C.   Analysis\n\n          Assuming arguendo that we have before us a final order of\n\nremoval,4 we still decline to exercise jurisdiction in this case\n\nfor prudential reasons.   We thus need not address whether a BIA\n\norder denying relief from removal and remanding for consideration\n\nof voluntary departure is a final order of removal.\n\n\n\n\n4\n   As discussed previously, a number of our sister circuits have\nheld that a BIA order denying relief from removal and remanding for\nconsideration of voluntary departure is a final order of removal.\nSee Alibasic, 547 F.3d at 83-84; Saldarriaga, 402 F.3d at 466 n.2;\nDel Pilar, 326 F.3d at 1157; Castrejón-García, 60 F.3d at 1361-62;\nPerkovic, 33 F.3d at 619.\n\n                               -12-\n\f          On its face, the current voluntary departure regulation\n\nreflects the Attorney General's intention to limit a petitioner's\n\neligibility for voluntary departure where the petitioner has sought\n\njudicial review, and to ensure uniformity in the administration of\n\nthe immigration laws.      The current voluntary departure regulation\n\nhas thus altered the decision-making process for a petitioner\n\ninterested in seeking judicial review of her petition: as of\n\nJanuary 20, 2009, she must elect either voluntary departure or\n\njudicial review of her petition.\n\n          The    automatic       termination   provision      of    the   current\n\nregulation assumes a chronological order, i.e., that the grant of\n\nvoluntary departure precedes the filing of a petition for judicial\n\nreview.   In the instant case, Hakim filed a petition for judicial\n\nreview before the IJ has been afforded the opportunity to determine\n\nHakim's   eligibility      for    voluntary    departure,      and    thus   the\n\nregulation    does   not   directly    address   the   case    at    hand.     By\n\nexercising jurisdiction in this case, we would be permitting Hakim\n\nto circumvent the regulation by allowing him to seek both voluntary\n\ndeparture and judicial review, thus hindering judicial economy and\n\ndenying the government the benefit of \"a prompt and costless\n\ndeparture.\"     See Dada, 554 U.S. at 32-33.            To prevent such a\n\nresult, we think it wiser, for prudential reasons, to remand the\n\ncase to the IJ so that she can decide whether to grant Hakim\n\nvoluntary departure.       Cf. Liu v. United States Dep't of Justice,\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f455 F.3d 106, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2006) (concluding that, \"as a matter\n\nof discretion,\" it was \"prudent and useful\" to remand to the BIA to\n\nresolve a question of first impression).       If Hakim is granted\n\nvoluntary departure, he can at that point decide whether to comply\n\nwith the relevant departure provisions, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), or\n\nelse to file a petition for judicial review of his applications for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal.\n\n                          III. Conclusion\n\n          In sum, we will not review the merits of Hakim's claim\n\nbecause   we   decline,   for   prudential   reasons,   to   exercise\n\njurisdiction at this time.      Accordingly, his petition seeking\n\nreview of the BIA's determination that he was not eligible for\n\nasylum or withholding of removal is dismissed without prejudice.\n\n          Dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f",

Hakim contends that the BIA erred when it determined that evidence of mistreatment he experienced in his native Indonesia failed to rise to the level of persecution within the meaning of the immigration laws. The government counters that we lack jurisdiction because we have not been presented with a final order of removal, and, in the alternative, that the Attorney General's issuance of a final rule on voluntary departure militates in favor of not finding a final order of removal.

Hakim's petition is thus dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Facts<sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>Hakim is an Indonesian citizen of Chinese ethnicity and Christian faith. In February of 1996, Hakim, who was fourteen years old at the time, was attacked by \"a group of people\" who identified him as Chinese and robbed him. One of the men struck Hakim with a block of wood, breaking his hand. Neither he nor his parents reported the incident to the police, considering it a \"waste\" to file a report because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> the police would see that they were Chinese and would probably then ask them for money. Although Hakim testified as to other events, the February 1996 incident was, according to him, \"the worst thing that happened\" to him.</p>\n<p>Hakim left Indonesia in 2001 and, the following year, applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>Hakim left Indonesia on September 26, 2001. The next day he was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant B2 Visitor for Pleasure with authorization to remain in the United States for a temporary period not to exceed March 24, 2002. He overstayed, and on September 24, 2002, Hakim submitted applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"). Hakim's application was referred to the Immigration Court in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>On August 5, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") commenced removal proceedings against Hakim by filing a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") with the Immigration Court alleging he had remained in the United States after March 24, 2002, without authorization, and was subject to removal. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). Hakim admitted the allegations contained in the NTA, conceded that he was removable, and renewed his requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>Hakim testified before the IJ on August 3, 2006, and, on February 5, 2007, the IJ issued a decision granting his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ concluded that the evidence presented by Hakim warranted a finding that he suffered past persecution in Indonesia. Given the finding of past persecution and the DHS's inability to provide evidence that conditions in Indonesia had changed, the IJ held that the government had failed to meet its burden of proving that Hakim's fears of future persecution were not well-founded. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1) (stating that once the applicant has demonstrated past persecution, DHS has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either \"a fundamental change in circumstances\" or the possibility of internal relocation). However, because Hakim \"failed to establish he would be detained and subject to torture or that the government of Indonesia would acquiesce in that harm being inflicted upon him[,]\" the IJ denied him protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>The government appealed to the BIA, which issued an opinion on April 24, 2009, reversing the IJ's grant of applications for asylum and for withholding of removal. The BIA rejected the IJ's conclusion that Hakim had established that he was a victim of past persecution. The BIA explained that the mistreatment inflicted on Hakim in the February 1996 robbery was \"reprehensible,\" but fell \"outside the scope of the type of mistreatment considered to be persecution,\" and that \"the other incidents of which he complained were [not] sufficiently severe, either cumulatively or in isolation, [nor] sufficiently related to an enumerated ground, to constitute persecution.\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> Concluding that Hakim had failed to establish past persecution, the BIA disagreed with the IJ's conclusion that he should benefit from a presumption of future persecution. The BIA found that Hakim \"did not persuasively articulate any specific basis on which he would be likely to be singled out for persecution[,]\" and there was insufficient evidence \"to support a conclusion that there is a pattern and practice of persecution against Christians or ethnically Chinese individuals in Indonesia.\" <i>See also </i><i>Decky,</i> 587 F.3d at 113 (\"We have repeatedly affirmed the BIA's determinations . . . that there is no ongoing pattern or practice of persecution against ethnic Chinese or Christians in Indonesia.\") (citation omitted). The BIA also held that Hakim failed to present evidence demonstrating that he would not be able to relocate to another part of Indonesia. Given these determinations, the BIA concluded that Hakim failed to prove that he should be granted asylum, and thus the more stringent withholding of removal. As the IJ had not considered whether Hakim was eligible for voluntary departure, the BIA remanded the case to the IJ to make such a determination.</p>\n<p>The IJ scheduled for January 14, 2010, a hearing to determine Hakim's eligibility for voluntary departure. On December 31, 2009, Hakim filed a motion for continuance before the IJ, which was granted on January 5, 2010. The IJ thus rescheduled the hearing date for July 22, 2010. Hakim currently seeks, in this Court, reversal of the BIA's decision on the merits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d), we have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal only if both of the following conditions are met. First, \"the alien [must have] exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1); <i>see </i><i>De Araujo v. Gonzales,</i> 457 F.3d 146, 152 (1st Cir.2006) (\"This exhaustion requirement generally means that the BIA must first review an IJ's determination of [removability] before a petitioner may present his appeal to us.\") (citation omitted). Second,</p>\n<blockquote>another court [cannot have] decided the validity of the order, unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceedings or that the remedy provided by the prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.</blockquote>\n<p>8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(2). That is, we lack jurisdiction to consider a petition raising arguments that a court has previously \"considered and rejected\" in a prior proceeding. <i>Paul v. United States Dep't of Justice,</i> 273 Fed.Appx. 64, 65 (2d Cir. 2008); <i>see </i><i>Gittens v. Menifee,</i> 428 F.3d 382, 386 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that an alien's second petition for review would fail under § 1252(d)(2) when \"a federal court has already ruled on the merits of his . . . argument\").</p>\n<p>The INA defines an \"order of [removal]\" as \"the order of the special inquiry officer, or other such administrative officer to whom the Attorney General has delegated the responsibility for determining whether an alien is [removable], concluding that the alien is [removable] <i>or</i> ordering [removal].\"<sup>[3]</sup> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47)(A) (emphasis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> added). Orders of removal become final upon \"(I) a determination by the [BIA] affirming such an order; or (ii) the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the [BIA,]\" whichever is earlier. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47)(B).</p>\n<p>Without directly addressing 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47), Hakim argues that the BIA's order remanding to the IJ to resolve the question of voluntary departure constitutes a final order of removal. He contends that, according to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1), we have jurisdiction because he has exhausted all administrative remedies in pursuit of his applications for asylum and withholding of removal, and another court has not decided the validity of the order. Furthermore, he contends that the only issue being considered on remand by the IJ is his eligibility for voluntary departure, not further review of his asylum or withholding of removal applications. In support of his argument, Hakim relies on a number of sister circuit cases, including <i>Alibasic v. Mukasey,</i> in which the Second Circuit held that \"a BIA order denying relief from removal and remanding for the sole purpose of considering voluntary departure is a final order of removal that this Court has jurisdiction to review.\" 547 F.3d 78, 83-84 (2d Cir.2008) (\"The IJ's underlying finding of removability based on [the alien's] concessions [of removability] still stands and . . . the BIA has simply removed an impediment to the removal that was ordered by the IJ.\") (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Saldarriaga v. Gonzales,</i> 402 F.3d 461, 466 n. 2 (4th Cir.2005) (\"[A] BIA order denying relief from deportation, but remanding the case for voluntary departure proceedings or other subsidiary determinations\" is a final order of removal that is \"immediately appealable.\"); <i>Del Pilar v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,</i> 326 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (finding that \"the BIA's remand for the limited purpose of permitting [petitioner] to designate a country of removal\" constituted a final order of removal); <i>Castrejón-García v. INS,</i> 60 F.3d 1359, 1361-62 (9th Cir.1995) (finding that the BIA's order reversing the grant of suspension and remanding to the IJ for a determination of voluntary departure was a final order of removal); <i>Perkovic v. INS,</i> 33 F.3d 615, 619 (6th Cir.1994) (\"We are aware of no authority for the proposition that a [BIA] order rejecting an asylum application is not a final order unless a formal order of deportation has already been issued.\").</p>\n<p>Despite the IJ having awarded asylum and withholding of removal to Hakim, the government argues that the IJ did not issue an order of removal, but merely noted that Hakim had conceded that he was removable. <i>But see </i><i>Chupina v. Holder,</i> 570 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir.2009) (\"[A]n award of withholding of removal requires entry of an underlying `order of removal.'\") (citation omitted). The government further argues that the Attorney General's issuance in 2008 of a final rule amending the regulation regarding voluntary departure militates in favor of finding that the BIA did not issue a final order of removal. <i>See</i> Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed.Reg. 76,927, 76,937 (Dec. 18, 2008) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240-1241, as relevant 1240.26(i)). Under that new voluntary departure regulation, effective as of January 20, 2009, \"any grant of voluntary departure shall terminate automatically upon the filing of the petition [for review] and the alternate order of removal[, which shall be entered upon granting a request made for voluntary departure,] . . . shall immediately take effect.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(d), (i). The decisions of our sister circuitsfinding that a BIA order denying relief from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> removal and remanding for voluntary departure is a final order of removalwere issued before this current voluntary departure regulation, and thus did not take it into consideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Voluntary Departure</h2>\n<p>Voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief. <i>Chi v. Holder,</i> 606 F.3d 6, 7 (1st Cir.2010). Voluntary departure is available (1) in lieu of or prior to the completion of removal proceedings or (2) at the conclusion of removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1). An IJ <i>may</i> grant voluntary departure at the conclusion of a removal proceeding if she finds that: (i) \"[t]he alien has been physically present in the United States for [a] period of at least one year preceding the date the [NTA] was served\"; (ii) \"[t]he alien is, and has been, a person of good moral character for at least five years immediately preceding the application\"; (iii) \"[t]he alien has not been convicted of [an aggravated felony] and is not deportable [on security grounds]\"; and (iv) \"[t]he alien has established by clear and convincing evidence that the alien has the means to depart the United States and has the intention to do so.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(1). The Supreme Court has described this relief as</p>\n<blockquote>an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement. In return for the anticipated benefit, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she \"has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so\" promptly. Included among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the 60-day period.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Dada v. Mukasey,</i> 554 U.S. 1, 32, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 171 L.Ed.2d 178 (2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has not resolved the issue of whether the federal courts of appeals have the authority to grant a motion to stay the voluntary departure period pending consideration of a petition for review on the merits. <i>See id.</i> at 18, 128 S.Ct. 2307. Our circuit has held that we have the authority \"to suspend the running of an unexpired voluntary departure period while a petition for judicial review is pending[,]\" <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 268 (1st Cir.2005), and while several of our sister circuits are in accord, at least one disagrees. <i>Compare </i><i>Thapa v. Gonzales,</i> 460 F.3d 323, 332 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the court <i>may</i> stay voluntary departure pending consideration of a petition for review on the merits), <i>Obale v. Attorney General,</i> 453 F.3d 151, 157 (3d Cir. 2006) (same), <i>Lopez-Chavez v. Ashcroft,</i> 383 F.3d 650, 654 (7th Cir.2004) (same), <i>Rife v. Ashcroft,</i> 374 F.3d 606, 616 (8th Cir.2004) (same), <i>Nwakanma v. Ashcroft,</i> 352 F.3d 325, 327 (6th Cir.2003) (same), <i>and </i><i>Himri v. Ashcroft,</i> 344 F.3d 1261, 1262 (9th Cir.2003) (same), <i>with </i><i>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft,</i> 371 F.3d 182, 194 (4th Cir. 2004) (finding that the court <i>may not</i> stay the voluntary departure period pending consideration of a petition for review). In response to the divergent federal practice and pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(e), the Attorney General subsequently issued a final rule on December 18, 2008. <i>See</i> Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed.Reg. at 76,937-38. That rule amended the voluntary departure regulation, which now, in part, provides that a grant of voluntary departure on or after January 20, 2009, automatically terminates with the filing of a petition for review. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> C.

He overstayed, and on September 24, 2002, Hakim submitted applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"). Hakim's application was referred to the Immigration Court in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>On August 5, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") commenced removal proceedings against Hakim by filing a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") with the Immigration Court alleging he had remained in the United States after March 24, 2002, without authorization, and was subject to removal. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). Hakim admitted the allegations contained in the NTA, conceded that he was removable, and renewed his requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>Hakim testified before the IJ on August 3, 2006, and, on February 5, 2007, the IJ issued a decision granting his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ concluded that the evidence presented by Hakim warranted a finding that he suffered past persecution in Indonesia. Given the finding of past persecution and the DHS's inability to provide evidence that conditions in Indonesia had changed, the IJ held that the government had failed to meet its burden of proving that Hakim's fears of future persecution were not well-founded. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1) (stating that once the applicant has demonstrated past persecution, DHS has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence either \"a fundamental change in circumstances\" or the possibility of internal relocation). However, because Hakim \"failed to establish he would be detained and subject to torture or that the government of Indonesia would acquiesce in that harm being inflicted upon him[,]\" the IJ denied him protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>The government appealed to the BIA, which issued an opinion on April 24, 2009, reversing the IJ's grant of applications for asylum and for withholding of removal. The BIA rejected the IJ's conclusion that Hakim had established that he was a victim of past persecution. The BIA explained that the mistreatment inflicted on Hakim in the February 1996 robbery was \"reprehensible,\" but fell \"outside the scope of the type of mistreatment considered to be persecution,\" and that \"the other incidents of which he complained were [not] sufficiently severe, either cumulatively or in isolation, [nor] sufficiently related to an enumerated ground, to constitute persecution.\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> Concluding that Hakim had failed to establish past persecution, the BIA disagreed with the IJ's conclusion that he should benefit from a presumption of future persecution. The BIA found that Hakim \"did not persuasively articulate any specific basis on which he would be likely to be singled out for persecution[,]\" and there was insufficient evidence \"to support a conclusion that there is a pattern and practice of persecution against Christians or ethnically Chinese individuals in Indonesia.\" <i>See also </i><i>Decky,</i> 587 F.3d at 113 (\"We have repeatedly affirmed the BIA's determinations . . . that there is no ongoing pattern or practice of persecution against ethnic Chinese or Christians in Indonesia.\") (citation omitted). The BIA also held that Hakim failed to present evidence demonstrating that he would not be able to relocate to another part of Indonesia. Given these determinations, the BIA concluded that Hakim failed to prove that he should be granted asylum, and thus the more stringent withholding of removal. As the IJ had not considered whether Hakim was eligible for voluntary departure, the BIA remanded the case to the IJ to make such a determination.</p>\n<p>The IJ scheduled for January 14, 2010, a hearing to determine Hakim's eligibility for voluntary departure. On December 31, 2009, Hakim filed a motion for continuance before the IJ, which was granted on January 5, 2010. The IJ thus rescheduled the hearing date for July 22, 2010. Hakim currently seeks, in this Court, reversal of the BIA's decision on the merits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d), we have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal only if both of the following conditions are met. First, \"the alien [must have] exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1); <i>see </i><i>De Araujo v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></span>, 152 (1st Cir.2006) (\"This exhaustion requirement generally means that the BIA must first review an IJ's determination of [removability] before a petitioner may present his appeal to us.\") (citation omitted). Second,</p>\n<blockquote>another court [cannot have] decided the validity of the order, unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceedings or that the remedy provided by the prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.</blockquote>\n<p>8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(2). That is, we lack jurisdiction to consider a petition raising arguments that a court has previously \"considered and rejected\" in a prior proceeding. <i>Paul v. United States Dep't of Justice,</i> 273 Fed.Appx. 64, 65 (2d Cir. 2008); <i>see </i><i>Gittens v. Menifee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792366\"><a href=\"/opinion/792366/maurice-gittens-v-fredrick-menifee-warden-fci/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 386 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that an alien's second petition for review would fail under § 1252(d)(2) when \"a federal court has already ruled on the merits of his . . . argument\").</p>\n<p>The INA defines an \"order of [removal]\" as \"the order of the special inquiry officer, or other such administrative officer to whom the Attorney General has delegated the responsibility for determining whether an alien is [removable], concluding that the alien is [removable] <i>or</i> ordering [removal].\"<sup>[3]</sup> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47)(A) (emphasis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> added). Orders of removal become final upon \"(I) a determination by the [BIA] affirming such an order; or (ii) the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the [BIA,]\" whichever is earlier. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47)(B).</p>\n<p>Without directly addressing 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47), Hakim argues that the BIA's order remanding to the IJ to resolve the question of voluntary departure constitutes a final order of removal. He contends that, according to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1), we have jurisdiction because he has exhausted all administrative remedies in pursuit of his applications for asylum and withholding of removal, and another court has not decided the validity of the order. Furthermore, he contends that the only issue being considered on remand by the IJ is his eligibility for voluntary departure, not further review of his asylum or withholding of removal applications. In support of his argument, Hakim relies on a number of sister circuit cases, including <i>Alibasic v. Mukasey,</i> in which the Second Circuit held that \"a BIA order denying relief from removal and remanding for the sole purpose of considering voluntary departure is a final order of removal that this Court has jurisdiction to review.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1225992\"><a href=\"/opinion/1225992/alibasic-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 83-84 (2d Cir.2008) (\"The IJ's underlying finding of removability based on [the alien's] concessions [of removability] still stands and . . . the BIA has simply removed an impediment to the removal that was ordered by the IJ.\") (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Saldarriaga v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789700\"><a href=\"/opinion/789700/apolinar-perafan-saldarriaga-luz-velasquez-carmona-adrianna-menesses/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 466 n. 2 (4th Cir.2005) (\"[A] BIA order denying relief from deportation, but remanding the case for voluntary departure proceedings or other subsidiary determinations\" is a final order of removal that is \"immediately appealable.\"); <i>Del Pilar v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781708\"><a href=\"/opinion/781708/joselito-del-pilar-v-united-states-attorney-general-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span>, 1157 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (finding that \"the BIA's remand for the limited purpose of permitting [petitioner] to designate a country of removal\" constituted a final order of removal); <i>Castrejón-García v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700496\"><a href=\"/opinion/700496/salvador-castrejon-garcia-v-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1359</span></a></span>, 1361-62 (9th Cir.1995) (finding that the BIA's order reversing the grant of suspension and remanding to the IJ for a determination of voluntary departure was a final order of removal); <i>Perkovic v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677046\"><a href=\"/opinion/677046/vaso-and-djela-perkovic-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span>, 619 (6th Cir.1994) (\"We are aware of no authority for the proposition that a [BIA] order rejecting an asylum application is not a final order unless a formal order of deportation has already been issued.\").</p>\n<p>Despite the IJ having awarded asylum and withholding of removal to Hakim, the government argues that the IJ did not issue an order of removal, but merely noted that Hakim had conceded that he was removable. <i>But see </i><i>Chupina v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1196943\"><a href=\"/opinion/1196943/chupina-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 104 (2d Cir.2009) (\"[A]n award of withholding of removal requires entry of an underlying `order of removal.'\") (citation omitted). The government further argues that the Attorney General's issuance in 2008 of a final rule amending the regulation regarding voluntary departure militates in favor of finding that the BIA did not issue a final order of removal. <i>See</i> Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed.Reg. 76,927, 76,937 (Dec. 18, 2008) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240-1241, as relevant 1240.26(i)). Under that new voluntary departure regulation, effective as of January 20, 2009, \"any grant of voluntary departure shall terminate automatically upon the filing of the petition [for review] and the alternate order of removal[, which shall be entered upon granting a request made for voluntary departure,] . . . shall immediately take effect.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(d), (i). The decisions of our sister circuitsfinding that a BIA order denying relief from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> removal and remanding for voluntary departure is a final order of removalwere issued before this current voluntary departure regulation, and thus did not take it into consideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Voluntary Departure</h2>\n<p>Voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief. <i>Chi v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147253\"><a href=\"/opinion/147253/chun-xin-chi-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2010). Voluntary departure is available (1) in lieu of or prior to the completion of removal proceedings or (2) at the conclusion of removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1). An IJ <i>may</i> grant voluntary departure at the conclusion of a removal proceeding if she finds that: (i) \"[t]he alien has been physically present in the United States for [a] period of at least one year preceding the date the [NTA] was served\"; (ii) \"[t]he alien is, and has been, a person of good moral character for at least five years immediately preceding the application\"; (iii) \"[t]he alien has not been convicted of [an aggravated felony] and is not deportable [on security grounds]\"; and (iv) \"[t]he alien has established by clear and convincing evidence that the alien has the means to depart the United States and has the intention to do so.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(1). The Supreme Court has described this relief as</p>\n<blockquote>an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement. In return for the anticipated benefit, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she \"has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so\" promptly. Included among the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the 60-day period.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Dada v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145792\"><a href=\"/opinion/145792/dada-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145792\"><a href=\"/opinion/145792/dada-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span> (2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has not resolved the issue of whether the federal courts of appeals have the authority to grant a motion to stay the voluntary departure period pending consideration of a petition for review on the merits. <i>See id.</i> at 18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145792\"><a href=\"/opinion/145792/dada-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2307</span></a></span>.

Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 268 (1st Cir.2005), and while several of our sister circuits are in accord, at least one disagrees. <i>Compare </i><i>Thapa v.

In response to the divergent federal practice and pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(e), the Attorney General subsequently issued a final rule on December 18, 2008. <i>See</i> Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed.Reg. at 76,937-38. That rule amended the voluntary departure regulation, which now, in part, provides that a grant of voluntary departure on or after January 20, 2009, automatically terminates with the filing of a petition for review. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> C. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Assuming arguendo that we have before us a final order of removal,<sup>[4]</sup> we still decline to exercise jurisdiction in this case for prudential reasons. We thus need not address whether a BIA order denying relief from removal and remanding for consideration of voluntary departure is a final order of removal.</p>\n<p>On its face, the current voluntary departure regulation reflects the Attorney General's intention to limit a petitioner's eligibility for voluntary departure where the petitioner has sought judicial review, and to ensure uniformity in the administration of the immigration laws. The current voluntary departure regulation has thus altered the decision-making process for a petitioner interested in seeking judicial review of her petition: as of January 20, 2009, she must elect either voluntary departure <i>or</i> judicial review of her petition.</p>\n<p>The automatic termination provision of the current regulation assumes a chronological order, i.e., that the grant of voluntary departure <i>precedes</i> the filing of a petition for judicial review. In the instant case, Hakim filed a petition for judicial review <i>before</i> the IJ has been afforded the opportunity to determine Hakim's eligibility for voluntary departure, and thus the regulation does not directly address the case at hand. By exercising jurisdiction in this case, we would be permitting Hakim to circumvent the regulation by allowing him to seek both voluntary departure and judicial review, thus hindering judicial economy and denying the government the benefit of \"a prompt and costless departure.\" <i>See </i><i>Dada,</i> 554 U.S. at 32-33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145792\"><a href=\"/opinion/145792/dada-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2307</span></a></span>. To prevent such a result, we think it wiser, for prudential reasons, to remand the case to the IJ so that she can decide whether to grant Hakim voluntary departure. <i>Cf. </i><i>Liu v. United States Dep't of Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795070\"><a href=\"/opinion/795070/yuanliang-liu-v-us-department-of-justice-attorney-general-alberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2006) (concluding that, \"as a matter of <i>discretion,</i>\" it was \"prudent and useful\" to remand to the BIA to resolve a question of first impression). If Hakim is granted voluntary departure, he can at that point decide whether to comply with the relevant departure provisions, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), or else to file a petition for judicial review of his applications for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In sum, we will not review the merits of Hakim's claim because we decline, for prudential reasons, to exercise jurisdiction at this time. Accordingly, his petition seeking review of the BIA's determination that he was not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal is dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p><i>Dismissed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon.
