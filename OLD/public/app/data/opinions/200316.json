The Fifth Amendment permits\n\nthe federal government to take personal property for public use,\n\nbut     requires    payment   of      \"just    compensation.\"     Plaintiffs-\n\nappellants, Portland Natural Gas Transmission System and Maritimes\n\n& Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. (\"the Pipeline Companies\"), took by\n\neminent    domain    temporary     and    permanent   easements   on   land   in\n\nHaverhill, Massachusetts owned by defendant-appellee, WBC Extrusion\n\nProducts, Inc. (\"WBC\"), to construct, operate and maintain a\n\npipeline as permitted by the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. § 717f(h).\n\nA bench trial was held in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts to determine the amount of compensation\n\ndue.     The court determined that WBC was entitled to $152,677 plus\n\ninterest.    The Pipeline Companies appeal, claiming that the amount\n\nis not justified by the evidence produced at trial.               We affirm.\n\n                                 I.   Background\n\n             The facts of this dispute are detailed in the district\n\ncourt's opinion, Portland Natural Gas Transmission Sys. v. 19.2\n\nAcres of Land, 195 F. Supp. 2d 314, 316-19 (D. Mass. 2002), and we\n\nrepeat only those necessary to our decision.             At the time of the\n\ntaking, WBC owned two parcels totaling approximately seventy-six\n\nacres.     Parcel 1 was divided into eight lots to be used for an\n\nindustrial park; Parcel 2 was a non-buildable vacant lot.                     WBC\n\noccupied Lot 7 in Parcel 1, and the other seven were empty and for\n\nsale.     The permanent gas pipeline easement is fifty feet wide and\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fruns through Lots 1 and 8 on Parcel 1 and through Parcel 2,\n\nencumbering approximately 2.37 acres total. The temporary easement\n\nran along a similar path, reaching approximately 2.10 acres total.\n\n                            II.    Standard of Review\n\n             We    review   the     district     court's     findings     of   facts,\n\nincluding the amount of compensation due, for clear error. Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 52(a); S. Nat. Gas Co. v. Land, Cullman County, 197 F.3d\n\n1368, 1372 (11th Cir. 1999) (\"This court reviews the district\n\ncourt's determination of just compensation for clear error.\");\n\nPuerto Rico Ports Auth. v. M/V Manhattan Prince, 897 F.2d 1, 3 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).       Our job is not to weigh the evidence anew, but simply\n\nto determine whether the decision reached by the trial court is\n\n\"plausible    in    light     of   the    record    viewed    in   its    entirety.\"\n\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985).                        The\n\nfact that     the    ruling      was    substantially    based     on    physical   or\n\ndocumentary evidence, rather than credibility determinations, does\n\nnot alter our deferential analysis.                Id.   Any rulings of law are\n\nsubject to de novo review.               United States v. Mass. Water Res.\n\nAuth., 256 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            As     this   case     is   fact    intensive,    we   note    that     the\n\nappellant has a difficult task of overcoming the trial court's\n\nfindings.     Determining the value of real estate is not a science,\n\nand the decision of a lower tribunal is ordinarily not disturbed\n\nunless \"grossly inadequate or excessive.\"                  4A Julius L. Sackman,\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fNichols on Eminent Domain § 17.1[4], 23.01 (rev. 3d ed. 2001)\n\n(hereinafter Nichols on Eminent Domain).\n\n                               III.    Discussion\n\n           The   land    taken    by     the   Pipeline     Companies     is   in\n\nMassachusetts, and the district court applied Massachusetts law to\n\ndetermine the just compensation to which WBC was entitled.                As the\n\nparties   do   not   contest    this    choice   of   law   and   there   is   no\n\nindication that it makes any difference as to any of the contested\n\nissues, we accept this premise without necessarily endorsing it.1\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, just compensation is defined as\n\n           the value [of the land] before the recording\n           of the order of taking, and in case only part\n           of a parcel of land is taken there shall be\n           included damages for all injury to the part\n           not taken caused by the taking or by the\n           public improvement for which the taking is\n           made.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 79, § 12 (2002).                Therefore, although the\n\neasement did not abrogate all of WBC's bundle of rights, WBC is\n\nentitled to compensation for the decrease in value of the land\n\n\n\n1\n   The federal eminent domain statute involved here provides that\n\"[t]he practice and procedure in any action or proceeding for\n[eminent domain] in the district court of the United States shall\nconform as nearly as may be with the practice and procedure in\nsimilar action or proceeding in the courts of the State where the\nproperty is situated.\" 15 U.S.C. § 717f(h). Perhaps surprisingly,\nseveral circuits have read the phrase \"practice and procedure\" to\nencompass state substantive law as well as formal practice. See,\ne.g., Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. Exclusive Natural Gas\nStorage Easement, 962 F.2d 1192, 1194-99 (6th Cir. 1992). For the\nreasons indicated, we need not pursue this interesting subject in\nthe present case.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fencumbered by the easement as well as the decrease in value of the\n\nother land on the lots, or the \"remaining land.\"             In addition, WBC\n\nis entitled to compensation for the temporary easement, or the two\n\nyears when the Pipeline Companies were using part of WBC's land for\n\nconstruction of the pipeline.           The compensation awards for these\n\nthree areas -- the encumbered land, the remaining land, and the\n\nland temporarily taken -- are the subject of this appeal.\n\n            A.    Encumbered and Remaining Land\n\n            In 1998, the Pipeline Companies promulgated \"Requirements\n\nfor   Construction        On   or      Near   Company      Facilities\"       (the\n\n\"Requirements\") to protect their pipelines from encroachment and\n\ndisturbance      caused   by   construction     activity    on   or   near    the\n\neasement.     WBC   claimed     that    the   easement   together     with    the\n\nRequirements rendered the permanent easement area worthless.2                 The\n\nPipeline Companies' expert testified that the encumbered land was\n\nstill useful and retained fifty percent of its value. The district\n\ncourt found that the Requirements diminished the value of the\n\nencumbered land beyond the Pipeline Companies' suggestion of fifty\n\npercent. The court found that \"a potential buyer who has read [the\n\nRequirements] would be likely to fear a substantial degree of\n\ninfringement on the land encumbered by a permanent easement,\" and\n\n\n\n2\n   The district court's determinations that the highest and best\nuse of Lots 1 and 8 is industrial use, and the highest and best use\nof Parcel 2 is open land, as well as its determination of the per\nacre value of the land, are not challenged.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdetermined   that    the    encumbered    land   was   reduced    in     value   by\n\nseventy-five percent.        Portland Natural Gas, 195 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n324.   The court also determined that the Requirements reduced the\n\nvalue of the remaining land by ten percent because \"[a] reasonable\n\nbuyer, after reading the [Requirements], would almost certainly\n\nanticipate that building in the vicinity of the easement areas of\n\nLots 1 and 8 would involve extra administrative 'hassle,' and\n\npossible extra construction expenditures.\"                Id. at 324.            The\n\nPipeline Companies argue that the diminution of the encumbered land\n\nis only fifty percent and that there is no diminution of the\n\nremaining land.     The Pipeline Companies claim that (1) the damages\n\ntheory employed      by    the   district   court   was   not    litigated       and\n\ntherefore    constituted     unfair   surprise,     and   (2)    there    was     no\n\nevidence    that    the    Requirements     diminished    the    value    of     the\n\nencumbered or remaining land.\n\n                     1.    Unfair Surprise\n\n            The Pipeline Companies claim that the effect of the\n\nRequirements on the value of the land was not litigated and was not\n\nconsidered an issue by the Pipeline Companies, and that they were\n\ntherefore unfairly surprised and prejudiced when the district court\n\nawarded damages based on the Requirements.             Appellants assert that\n\nthe unfair surprise necessitates a new trial and that the district\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fcourt lacked authority to enter judgment on the issue because it\n\nhad not been squarely litigated.3\n\n          The record indicates that the parties addressed the\n\nRequirements issue in their motions and papers before the court.\n\nWBC stated that the Requirements diminished the value of the land\n\nin question, while appellants emphasized that the effect of the\n\nRequirements can only be determined on a case by case basis.     A\n\nmotion in limine discussed and included the Requirements.\n\n          The Requirements issue also consumed extensive time at\n\ntrial.   In his opening statement, WBC's counsel stated that the\n\nRequirements would be discovered by a reasonably prudent buyer, and\n\nthat the \"nub of the dispute\" was what that buyer would do when\n\nfaced with the Requirements. The Requirements were introduced into\n\nevidence without objection and outlined by Franklin Gessner, a\n\nwitness for appellants.   The Pipeline Companies' expert, Steven\n\nFoster, had not been provided with the Requirements before making\n\nhis estimation of damages, and stated that his figures might have\n\nbeen different had he considered the Requirements.       The judge\n\ndirectly asked Foster several questions about a possible diminution\n\nassociated with the increased construction costs and the hassle of\n\ndealing with the Pipeline Companies due to the Requirements.\n\n\n3\n  We note, without reaching the issue, that appellants' failure to\nask for a continuance may be fatal to their claim of unfair\nsurprise. See United States v. Díaz-Villafañe, 874 F.2d 43, 47\n(1st Cir. 1989) (suggesting that unfair surprise may usually be\ncured by a request for a continuance).\n\n                               -7-\n\fFoster responded that \"on a rational level . . . there would be\n\n[diminution],\" although stating that he did not have market data to\n\nverify the judge's intuition.          Finally, during appellants' closing\n\nargument, the judge stated that \"the ordinary and reasonable person\n\nreading [the Requirements] would read them and say: I've got to\n\nworry about them.\"        With the plethora of evidence to the contrary,\n\nthe Pipeline Companies' argument that they were prejudicially\n\nsurprised when the court determined diminution in value based on\n\nthe     effect        of       the         Requirements       must     fail.\n\n                     2.    Impact of the Requirements\n\n            Under Massachusetts law, WBC is entitled to recover for\n\nall incidental effects of the public improvement that impair the\n\nvalue of its land. Roman Catholic Bishop v. Commonwealth, 392 N.E.\n\n2d 829, 831 (Mass. 1979).          This includes not only the lost value of\n\nthe encumbered land, but any \"damages to the remainder that are to\n\nbe reasonably anticipated from use of the property for the purpose\n\nfor which the condemnation is made.\"              Nichols on Eminent Domain\n\n§ 14A.06[3].      Eminent domain is a concept of equity and fairness,\n\nand   the   law   attempts    to    make   the   landowner   whole.   Id.   at\n\n14.02[1][a].\n\n            The district court found the encumbered land to be\n\ndiminished by seventy-five percent, based in part on the effect of\n\nthe Requirements.     The court also determined that the Requirements\n\nreduced the value of the remaining land on Lots 1 and 8 by ten\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fpercent.   This was based on the court's view that \"[p]otential\n\nbuyers   may   reasonably     fear    that   the   presence    of    underground\n\npipelines on their property may make commercial construction more\n\ncostly and inconvenient on the adjacent land.\"                Portland Natural\n\nGas Transmission Sys., 195 F. Supp. 2d at 325.                Appellants claim\n\nthat there was no basis for determining by what precise amount or\n\npercentage the Requirements adversely affected the value of the\n\nland.\n\n           The trier of fact is \"authorized to determine damages in\n\nan amount to which no expert testified by rejecting the precise\n\namounts to which each expert testified.\" Nichols on Eminent Domain\n\n§ 17.1; see also Loschi v. Mass. Port Auth., 282 N.E.2d 418, 419-20\n\n(Mass.   1972)   (upholding     a    jury    verdict   in   excess    of    expert\n\ntestimony because fact-finder could also consider photographs and\n\nother witness testimony).           The judge was entitled to reject the\n\nexperts' valuation and to use her independent judgment to determine\n\nvalue.   Piemonte v. New Boston Garden Corp., 387 N.E.2d 1145, 1152\n\n(Mass. 1979).    The court considered the Requirements themselves,\n\nphotographs, and expert and lay testimony in determining that the\n\nvalue of the Requirements had a negative impact on the value of the\n\nland. Its decision as to the extent of the resulting diminution in\n\nvalue was not clearly erroneous.\n\n           A   reading   of   the    Requirements      supports     the    court's\n\ndetermination that the Requirements would decrease the price a\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\freasonable buyer was willing to pay for the land. The Requirements\n\nprovide that the encumbered land may not be used for structure,\n\nstorage, or trees. Further, a landowner must submit proposed plans\n\nto the Pipeline Companies for authorization before beginning any\n\nwork on or near the easement.      Approval is also required for many\n\nother uses that would commonly be undertaken on a vacant industrial\n\nlot, including grade reduction, movement of heavy equipment across\n\nthe easement, installation of electrical cables, power lines, and\n\ntelephone    lines,   and   blasting   and   excavation.   Finally,   the\n\nPipeline Companies \"reserve[] the right to set forth additional\n\nrequirements if deemed necessary.\"\n\n            The Pipeline Companies assert that the Requirements do\n\nnot impact the land's value because prospective buyers may choose\n\nto use the land in a way that conforms with the Requirements.         We\n\nfind the existence of such a buyer doubtful given the breadth of\n\nthe Requirements and appellants' discretion to modify them as it\n\nwishes.     In addition, prospective owners would have to deal with\n\nthe added burden of obtaining approval from the easement holder\n\nbefore undertaking any work on the vacant lot.        The inference that\n\nthe Requirements impact the property's value is common sense: if a\n\nsimilarly-situated industrial lot exists that is free from the\n\npipeline easement and the Requirements that go along with it, a\n\npotential buyer will likely forego the WBC lot in favor of the\n\nunencumbered lot.     Therefore, WBC must lower its price to attract\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fbuyers.    This is a logical consideration, and the fact that no\n\nexpert spelled out this exact argument does not mean the judge\n\ncould not arrive at it on her own.\n\n           The court heard conflicting evidence regarding the extent\n\nof the impact of the easement and Requirements on the land.                   The\n\nPipeline Companies' expert testified based on \"experience and\n\njudgment\" that the encumbered land was reduced in value by fifty\n\npercent, although he admitted that there is no standard in the\n\nindustry for determining diminution and that he had heard of\n\ndifferent valuations in other cases, ranging from forty to seventy-\n\nfive percent.      This expert, however, did not have the benefit of\n\nthe Requirements      when    making    his   estimate,    as   they   were   not\n\nprovided to him by the Pipeline Companies.                 A witness for WBC\n\nstated that he believed the Requirements negatively impacted the\n\nland.     Witnesses also debated what administrative burden the\n\nRequirements would place on a landowner.\n\n           In light of all the evidence, the district court, acting\n\nas fact-finder, \"made its determination[] based on its reasonable\n\nassessment of the conflicting evidence before it.\"                     Northeast\n\nDrilling, Inc. v. Inner Space Servs., Inc., 243 F.3d 25, 34 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).     The court's determination was not clearly erroneous.\n\n           B.   Temporary Easement\n\n           WBC's     expert    opined     that   the      temporary    easement\n\neffectively delayed the sale of, and any development on, the lots\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\ffor the full two-year period.            He testified that developers had\n\nverified this hypothesis, stating that so long as unencumbered lots\n\nwere available, buyers would go elsewhere.            The Pipeline Companies\n\nurged the court to simply award the rental value for those sections\n\nof each lot taken temporarily.           The court did so but also awarded\n\nsix months rental value for all of Lots 1 and 8.                    The Pipeline\n\nCompanies challenge this additional award.\n\n            Compensation    for     a     temporary      taking    is   generally\n\ndetermined by \"(1) ascertaining the value of the property for the\n\nperiod it is held by the condemnor; (2) ascertaining the difference\n\nin the value of the property before and after the taking; or (3)\n\nlooking at the fair market rental value of the property during the\n\ntime it was taken.\"     Nichols on Eminent Domain § 12E.01[1].\n\n            We find the district court's determination a reasonable\n\nascertainment of the value of the property taken.                 The court heard\n\ntestimony that prospective buyers desire to begin construction\n\nwithin twelve months, and the court found that construction on\n\nWBC's   land    generally   would       begin   within    eighteen      months   of\n\npurchase.      Because the Pipeline Companies required access to a\n\nportion of the land, development likely could not begin until the\n\nend of the temporary easement.

Sackman, <i>Nichols on Eminent Domain</i> &#167; 17.1[4], 23.01 (rev.3d ed.2001) (hereinafter <i>Nichols on Eminent Domain</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The land taken by the Pipeline Companies is in Massachusetts, and the district court applied Massachusetts law to determine the just compensation to which WBC was entitled. As the parties do not contest this choice of law and there is no indication that it makes any difference as to any of the contested issues, we accept this premise without necessarily endorsing it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Under Massachusetts law, just compensation is defined as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the value [of the land] before the recording of the order of taking, and in case only part of a parcel of land is taken there shall be included damages for all injury to the part not taken caused by the taking or by the public improvement for which the taking is made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 79, &#167; 12 (2002). Therefore, although the easement did not abrogate all of WBC's bundle of rights, WBC is entitled to compensation for the decrease in value of the land encumbered by the easement as well as the decrease in value of the other land on the lots, or the \"remaining land.\" In addition, WBC is entitled to compensation for the temporary easement, or the two years when the Pipeline Companies were using part of WBC's land for construction of the pipeline. The compensation awards for these three areas &#8212; the encumbered land, the remaining land, and the land temporarily taken &#8212; are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Encumbered and Remaining Land</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, the Pipeline Companies promulgated \"Requirements for Construction On or Near Company Facilities\" (the \"Requirements\") to protect their pipelines from encroachment and disturbance caused by construction activity on or near the easement. WBC claimed that the easement together with the Requirements rendered the permanent easement area worthless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Pipeline Companies' expert testified that the encumbered land was still useful and retained fifty percent of its value. The district court found that the Requirements diminished the value of the encumbered land beyond the Pipeline Companies' suggestion of fifty percent. The court found that \"a potential buyer who has read [the Requirements] would be likely to fear a substantial degree of infringement on the land encumbered by a permanent easement,\" and determined that the encumbered land was reduced in value by seventy-five percent. <i>Portland Natural Gas,</i> 195 F.Supp.2d at 324. The court also determined that the Requirements reduced the value of the remaining land by ten percent because \"[a] reasonable buyer, after reading the [Requirements], would almost certainly anticipate that building in the vicinity of the easement areas of Lots 1 and 8 would involve extra administrative `hassle,' and possible extra construction expenditures.\" <i>Id.</i> at 324. The Pipeline Companies argue that the diminution of the encumbered land is only fifty percent and that there is no diminution of the remaining land. The Pipeline Companies claim that (1) the damages theory employed by the district court was not litigated and therefore constituted unfair surprise, and (2) there was no evidence that the Requirements diminished the value of the encumbered or remaining land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>Unfair Surprise</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pipeline Companies claim that the effect of the Requirements on the value of the land was not litigated and was not considered an issue by the Pipeline Companies, and that they were therefore unfairly surprised and prejudiced when the district court awarded damages based on the Requirements. Appellants assert that the unfair surprise necessitates a new trial and that the district court lacked authority to enter judgment on the issue because it had not been squarely litigated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record indicates that the parties addressed the Requirements issue in their motions and papers before the court. WBC stated that the Requirements diminished the value of the land in question, while appellants emphasized that the effect of the Requirements can only be determined on a case by case basis. A motion in limine discussed and included the Requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Requirements issue also consumed extensive time at trial. In his opening statement, WBC's counsel stated that the Requirements would be discovered by a reasonably prudent buyer, and that the \"nub of the dispute\" was what that buyer would do when faced with the Requirements. The Requirements were introduced into evidence without objection and outlined by Franklin Gessner, a witness for appellants. The Pipeline Companies' expert, Steven Foster, had not been provided with the Requirements before making his estimation of damages, and stated that his figures might have been different had he considered the Requirements. The judge directly asked Foster several questions about a possible diminution associated with the increased construction costs and the hassle of dealing with the Pipeline Companies due to the Requirements. Foster responded that \"on a rational level... there would be [diminution],\" although stating that he did not have market data to verify the judge's intuition. Finally, during appellants' closing argument, the judge stated that \"the ordinary and reasonable person reading [the Requirements] would read them and say: I've got to worry about them.\" With the plethora of evidence to the contrary, the Pipeline Companies' argument that they were prejudicially surprised when the court determined diminution in value based on the effect of the Requirements must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Impact of the Requirements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, WBC is entitled to recover for all incidental effects of the public improvement that impair the value of its land. <i>Roman Catholic Bishop v. Commonwealth,</i> 378 Mass. 381, 392 N.E.2d 829, 831 (1979). This includes not only the lost value of the encumbered land, but any \"damages to the remainder that are to be reasonably anticipated from use of the property for the purpose for which the condemnation is made.\" <i>Nichols on Eminent Domain</i> &#167; 14A.06[3]. Eminent domain is a concept of equity and fairness, and the law attempts to make the landowner whole. <i>Id.</i> at 14.02[1][a].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the encumbered land to be diminished by seventy-five percent, based in part on the effect of the Requirements. The court also determined that the Requirements reduced the value of the remaining land on Lots 1 and 8 by ten percent. This was based on the court's view that \"[p]otential buyers may reasonably fear that the presence of underground pipelines on their property may make commercial construction more costly and inconvenient on the adjacent land.\" <i>Portland Natural Gas Transmission Sys.,</i> 195 F.Supp.2d at 325. Appellants claim that there was no basis for determining by what precise amount or percentage the Requirements adversely affected the value of the land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trier of fact is \"authorized to determine damages in an amount to which no expert testified by rejecting the precise amounts to which each expert testified.\" <i>Nichols on Eminent Domain</i> &#167; 17.1; <i>see also Loschi v. Mass. Port Auth.,</i> 361 Mass. 714, 282 N.E.2d 418, 419-20 (1972) (upholding a jury verdict in excess of expert testimony because fact-finder could also consider photographs and other witness testimony). The judge was entitled to reject the experts' valuation and to use her independent judgment to determine value. <i>Piemonte v. New Boston Garden Corp.,</i> 377 Mass. 719, 387 N.E.2d 1145, 1152 (1979). The court considered the Requirements themselves, photographs, and expert and lay testimony in determining that the value of the Requirements had a negative impact on the value of the land. Its decision as to the extent of the resulting diminution in value was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reading of the Requirements supports the court's determination that the Requirements would decrease the price a reasonable buyer was willing to pay for the land. The Requirements provide that the encumbered land may not be used for structure, storage, or trees. Further, a landowner must submit proposed plans to the Pipeline Companies for authorization before beginning any work on or near the easement. Approval is also required for many other uses that would commonly be undertaken on a vacant industrial lot, including grade reduction, movement of heavy equipment across the easement, installation of electrical cables, power lines, and telephone lines, and blasting and excavation. Finally, the Pipeline Companies \"reserve[] the right to set forth additional requirements if deemed necessary.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pipeline Companies assert that the Requirements do not impact the land's value because prospective buyers may choose to use the land in a way that conforms with the Requirements. We find the existence of such a buyer doubtful given the breadth of the Requirements and appellants' discretion to modify them as it wishes. In addition, prospective owners would have to deal with the added burden of obtaining approval from the easement holder before undertaking any work on the vacant lot. The inference that the Requirements impact the property's value is common sense: if a similarly-situated industrial lot exists that is free from the pipeline easement and the Requirements that go along with it, a potential buyer will likely forego the WBC lot in favor of the unencumbered lot. Therefore, WBC must lower its price to attract buyers. This is a logical consideration, and the fact that no expert spelled out this exact argument does not mean the judge could not arrive at it on her own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court heard conflicting evidence regarding the extent of the impact of the easement and Requirements on the land. The Pipeline Companies' expert testified based on \"experience and judgment\" that the encumbered land was reduced in value by fifty percent, although he admitted that there is no standard in the industry for determining diminution and that he had heard of different valuations in other cases, ranging from forty to seventy-five percent. This expert, however, did not have the benefit of the Requirements when making his estimate, as they were not provided to him by the Pipeline Companies. A witness for WBC stated that he believed the Requirements negatively impacted the land. Witnesses also debated what administrative burden the Requirements would place on a landowner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of all the evidence, the district court, acting as fact-finder, \"made its determination[] based on its reasonable assessment of the conflicting evidence before it.\" <i>Northeast Drilling, Inc. v. Inner Space Servs., Inc.,</i> 243 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir.2001). The court's determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Temporary Easement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WBC's expert opined that the temporary easement effectively delayed the sale of, and any development on, the lots for the full two-year period. He testified that developers had verified this hypothesis, stating that so long as unencumbered lots were available, buyers would go elsewhere. The Pipeline Companies urged the court to simply award the rental value for those sections of each lot taken temporarily. The court did so but also awarded six months rental value for all of Lots 1 and 8. The Pipeline Companies challenge this additional award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compensation for a temporary taking is generally determined by \"(1) ascertaining the value of the property for the period it is held by the condemnor; (2) ascertaining the difference in the value of the property before and after the taking; or (3) looking at the fair market rental value of the property during the time it was taken.\" <i>Nichols on Eminent Domain</i> &#167; 12E.01[1].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the district court's determination a reasonable ascertainment of the value of the property taken. The court heard testimony that prospective buyers desire to begin construction within twelve months, and the court found that construction on WBC's land generally would begin within eighteen months of purchase. Because the Pipeline Companies required access to a portion of the land, development likely could not begin until the end of the temporary easement. Thus, a potential buyer would wait until six months after the temporary taking had begun before purchasing the property, or would adjust his offer to reflect this waiting time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the decision of the district court determining just compensation.

As the parties do not contest this choice of law and there is no indication that it makes any difference as to any of the contested issues, we accept this premise without necessarily endorsing it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Under Massachusetts law, just compensation is defined as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the value [of the land] before the recording of the order of taking, and in case only part of a parcel of land is taken there shall be included damages for all injury to the part not taken caused by the taking or by the public improvement for which the taking is made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 79, &#167; 12 (2002). Therefore, although the easement did not abrogate all of WBC's bundle of rights, WBC is entitled to compensation for the decrease in value of the land encumbered by the easement as well as the decrease in value of the other land on the lots, or the \"remaining land.\" In addition, WBC is entitled to compensation for the temporary easement, or the two years when the Pipeline Companies were using part of WBC's land for construction of the pipeline. The compensation awards for these three areas &#8212; the encumbered land, the remaining land, and the land temporarily taken &#8212; are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Encumbered and Remaining Land</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, the Pipeline Companies promulgated \"Requirements for Construction On or Near Company Facilities\" (the \"Requirements\") to protect their pipelines from encroachment and disturbance caused by construction activity on or near the easement. WBC claimed that the easement together with the Requirements rendered the permanent easement area worthless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Pipeline Companies' expert testified that the encumbered land was still useful and retained fifty percent of its value. The district court found that the Requirements diminished the value of the encumbered land beyond the Pipeline Companies' suggestion of fifty percent. The court found that \"a potential buyer who has read [the Requirements] would be likely to fear a substantial degree of infringement on the land encumbered by a permanent easement,\" and determined that the encumbered land was reduced in value by seventy-five percent. <i>Portland Natural Gas,</i> 195 F.Supp.2d at 324. The court also determined that the Requirements reduced the value of the remaining land by ten percent because \"[a] reasonable buyer, after reading the [Requirements], would almost certainly anticipate that building in the vicinity of the easement areas of Lots 1 and 8 would involve extra administrative `hassle,' and possible extra construction expenditures.\" <i>Id.</i> at 324. The Pipeline Companies argue that the diminution of the encumbered land is only fifty percent and that there is no diminution of the remaining land. The Pipeline Companies claim that (1) the damages theory employed by the district court was not litigated and therefore constituted unfair surprise, and (2) there was no evidence that the Requirements diminished the value of the encumbered or remaining land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>Unfair Surprise</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pipeline Companies claim that the effect of the Requirements on the value of the land was not litigated and was not considered an issue by the Pipeline Companies, and that they were therefore unfairly surprised and prejudiced when the district court awarded damages based on the Requirements. Appellants assert that the unfair surprise necessitates a new trial and that the district court lacked authority to enter judgment on the issue because it had not been squarely litigated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record indicates that the parties addressed the Requirements issue in their motions and papers before the court. WBC stated that the Requirements diminished the value of the land in question, while appellants emphasized that the effect of the Requirements can only be determined on a case by case basis. A motion in limine discussed and included the Requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Requirements issue also consumed extensive time at trial. In his opening statement, WBC's counsel stated that the Requirements would be discovered by a reasonably prudent buyer, and that the \"nub of the dispute\" was what that buyer would do when faced with the Requirements. The Requirements were introduced into evidence without objection and outlined by Franklin Gessner, a witness for appellants. The Pipeline Companies' expert, Steven Foster, had not been provided with the Requirements before making his estimation of damages, and stated that his figures might have been different had he considered the Requirements. The judge directly asked Foster several questions about a possible diminution associated with the increased construction costs and the hassle of dealing with the Pipeline Companies due to the Requirements. Foster responded that \"on a rational level... there would be [diminution],\" although stating that he did not have market data to verify the judge's intuition. Finally, during appellants' closing argument, the judge stated that \"the ordinary and reasonable person reading [the Requirements] would read them and say: I've got to worry about them.\" With the plethora of evidence to the contrary, the Pipeline Companies' argument that they were prejudicially surprised when the court determined diminution in value based on the effect of the Requirements must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. <i>Impact of the Requirements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, WBC is entitled to recover for all incidental effects of the public improvement that impair the value of its land. <i>Roman Catholic Bishop v. Commonwealth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2160457\"><a href=\"/opinion/2160457/roman-catholic-bishop-of-springfield-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2160457\"><a href=\"/opinion/2160457/roman-catholic-bishop-of-springfield-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span>, 831 (1979). This includes not only the lost value of the encumbered land, but any \"damages to the remainder that are to be reasonably anticipated from use of the property for the purpose for which the condemnation is made.\" <i>Nichols on Eminent Domain</i> &#167; 14A.06[3]. Eminent domain is a concept of equity and fairness, and the law attempts to make the landowner whole. <i>Id.</i> at 14.02[1][a].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the encumbered land to be diminished by seventy-five percent, based in part on the effect of the Requirements. The court also determined that the Requirements reduced the value of the remaining land on Lots 1 and 8 by ten percent. This was based on the court's view that \"[p]otential buyers may reasonably fear that the presence of underground pipelines on their property may make commercial construction more costly and inconvenient on the adjacent land.\" <i>Portland Natural Gas Transmission Sys.,</i> 195 F.Supp.2d at 325. Appellants claim that there was no basis for determining by what precise amount or percentage the Requirements adversely affected the value of the land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trier of fact is \"authorized to determine damages in an amount to which no expert testified by rejecting the precise amounts to which each expert testified.\" <i>Nichols on Eminent Domain</i> &#167; 17.1; <i>see also Loschi v. Mass.

The judge was entitled to reject the experts' valuation and to use her independent judgment to determine value. <i>Piemonte v. New Boston Garden Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2217647\"><a href=\"/opinion/2217647/piemonte-v-new-boston-garden-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2217647\"><a href=\"/opinion/2217647/piemonte-v-new-boston-garden-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></a></span>, 1152 (1979). The court considered the Requirements themselves, photographs, and expert and lay testimony in determining that the value of the Requirements had a negative impact on the value of the land. Its decision as to the extent of the resulting diminution in value was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reading of the Requirements supports the court's determination that the Requirements would decrease the price a reasonable buyer was willing to pay for the land. The Requirements provide that the encumbered land may not be used for structure, storage, or trees. Further, a landowner must submit proposed plans to the Pipeline Companies for authorization before beginning any work on or near the easement. Approval is also required for many other uses that would commonly be undertaken on a vacant industrial lot, including grade reduction, movement of heavy equipment across the easement, installation of electrical cables, power lines, and telephone lines, and blasting and excavation. Finally, the Pipeline Companies \"reserve[] the right to set forth additional requirements if deemed necessary.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pipeline Companies assert that the Requirements do not impact the land's value because prospective buyers may choose to use the land in a way that conforms with the Requirements. We find the existence of such a buyer doubtful given the breadth of the Requirements and appellants' discretion to modify them as it wishes. In addition, prospective owners would have to deal with the added burden of obtaining approval from the easement holder before undertaking any work on the vacant lot. The inference that the Requirements impact the property's value is common sense: if a similarly-situated industrial lot exists that is free from the pipeline easement and the Requirements that go along with it, a potential buyer will likely forego the WBC lot in favor of the unencumbered lot. Therefore, WBC must lower its price to attract buyers. This is a logical consideration, and the fact that no expert spelled out this exact argument does not mean the judge could not arrive at it on her own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court heard conflicting evidence regarding the extent of the impact of the easement and Requirements on the land. The Pipeline Companies' expert testified based on \"experience and judgment\" that the encumbered land was reduced in value by fifty percent, although he admitted that there is no standard in the industry for determining diminution and that he had heard of different valuations in other cases, ranging from forty to seventy-five percent. This expert, however, did not have the benefit of the Requirements when making his estimate, as they were not provided to him by the Pipeline Companies. A witness for WBC stated that he believed the Requirements negatively impacted the land. Witnesses also debated what administrative burden the Requirements would place on a landowner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of all the evidence, the district court, acting as fact-finder, \"made its determination[] based on its reasonable assessment of the conflicting evidence before it.\" <i>Northeast Drilling, Inc. v. Inner Space Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199314\"><a href=\"/opinion/199314/northeast-drilling-v-inner-space-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2001). The court's determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Temporary Easement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WBC's expert opined that the temporary easement effectively delayed the sale of, and any development on, the lots for the full two-year period. He testified that developers had verified this hypothesis, stating that so long as unencumbered lots were available, buyers would go elsewhere. The Pipeline Companies urged the court to simply award the rental value for those sections of each lot taken temporarily. The court did so but also awarded six months rental value for all of Lots 1 and 8. The Pipeline Companies challenge this additional award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compensation for a temporary taking is generally determined by \"(1) ascertaining the value of the property for the period it is held by the condemnor; (2) ascertaining the difference in the value of the property before and after the taking; or (3) looking at the fair market rental value of the property during the time it was taken.\" <i>Nichols on Eminent Domain</i> &#167; 12E.01[1].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the district court's determination a reasonable ascertainment of the value of the property taken. The court heard testimony that prospective buyers desire to begin construction within twelve months, and the court found that construction on WBC's land generally would begin within eighteen months of purchase. Because the Pipeline Companies required access to a portion of the land, development likely could not begin until the end of the temporary easement. Thus, a potential buyer would wait until six months after the temporary taking had begun before purchasing the property, or would adjust his offer to reflect this waiting time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the decision of the district court determining just compensation.
