H.  Raymond Kellett, Jr., has appealed\n                    \n\nthe  district court's dismissal of his habeas petition on res\n\njudicata grounds.   On  appeal,  the  government agrees  with\n\nKellett  that  the district  court  erred  in dismissing  the\n\npetition.   It concurs that the doctrine of res judicata does\n\nnot  apply in  habeas  or postconviction  proceedings.   See,\n                                                             \n\ne.g.,  Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 8, 14-15 (1963).\n                               \n\nThe parties also explain convincingly that the  court had not\n\nresolved Kellett's earlier petition under 28 U.S.C.   2255 on\n\nthe merits.  The  government argues, however, that  remand is\n\nnot necessary  because Kellett's  petition is meritless  as a\n\nmatter of law.   After reviewing the petition and  the record\n\non appeal, we agree and therefore affirm.1\n\n          In his  habeas petition,  Kellett claimed  that the\n\nprosecutor had  concealed material exculpatory  evidence from\n\nhim, i.e., that  senior bank officers and directors had known\n\nthat false loan applications were being submitted to the bank\n\nfor approval.  On  appeal, he argues  that he would not  have\n\npled guilty to  the charge  of making false  statements to  a\n\nfederally insured bank in violation of 18 U.S.C.   1014 if he\n\nhad known of this evidence.  Kellett's argument appears to be\n\nthat  this  evidence  was  exculpatory  because  a  necessary\n\n                    \n\n1.  We hereby  grant the government's motion  to withdraw its\noriginal  appendix and  to  substitute an  appendix excluding\nKellett's presentence report.  In determining this appeal, we\nhave  considered  only   the  contents  of   the  replacement\nappendix.\n\nelement of  the crime to  which he pled  guilty was  that the\n\nbank have relied on the false statements when it approved the\n\nloans.  That  is, Kellett  says that no  crime under  section\n\n1014 would have been  committed if the bank was  not actually\n\ndeceived  when it approved loans  on the basis  of false loan\n\ndocuments.   Abundant  case  law to  the contrary  undermines\n\nKellett's claim.   See, e.g., United  States v. Norberg,  612\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1979) (the focus of the statute is that\n\na false statement was made for the purpose of influencing the\n                                                         \n\nbank  to take  certain action;  the cases  make clear  that a\n\nbank's reliance  on the  false statement is  irrelevant); see\n                                                             \n\nalso  United States v. Johnson,  585 F.2d 119,  125 (5th Cir.\n                              \n\n1978)  (The statute  applies \"not only  [to] a  defendant who\n\nintends to defraud an  unwitting insured institution but also\n\n[to]  a   defendant  who   intends  to  cooperate   with  the\n\ninstitution in a scheme requiring him, with the institution's\n\nknowledge, to  make false  statements for the  furtherance of\n\nthe scheme.   The [institution's]  awareness of the  fraud is\n\nnot relevant, for its existence is  not inconsistent with the\n\nintent   to  influence  which  a  violator  of     1014  must\n\npossess.\").  \n\n          We  note  further  that,  under section  1014,  the\n\ncritical knowledge is that possessed  by the person making or\n\ncausing the false statement to be made.  See United States v.\n                                                          \n\nConcemi,  957  F.2d 942,  951  (1st Cir.  1992)  (among other\n       \n\n                             -3-\n\nthings, the  government must  show that the  defendant \"acted\n\nknowingly\"  in making or causing a false statement be made to\n\na  federally insured  bank).   Although  Kellett suggests  on\n\nappeal that  the bank actually prepared  the false documents,\n\nby pleading guilty  he admitted  that he had  made or  caused\n\nfalse statements to be  made and that he knew  the statements\n\nwere  false.  It is too late  for Kellett to deny the factual\n\nbasis of  the charge  to which  he pled  guilty.  See  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Morrison, 938 F.2d  168, 171 (10th  Cir. 1991) (in\n                   \n\nsentencing   challenge,  defendant  could  not  assert  facts\n\ncontrary  to those  to  which  he  pled  guilty).    This  is\n\nespecially true since the \"fact\"  in question is what Kellett\n\nhimself knew about the accuracy of the statements in the loan\n\ndocuments.    Kellett must  have known  at  the time  he pled\n\nguilty  whether  or  not  he  knew  that  the loan  documents\n\ncontained  falsehoods  which  would  influence  the  bank  to\n\napprove  the  loans,  and  the  state  of knowledge  of  bank\n\nofficers  or  directors  had  no bearing  on  that  question.\n\nTherefore, any failure by the prosecutor to tell Kellett what\n\nthose officers or  directors knew would provide no  basis for\n\npermitting Kellett to withdraw his guilty plea.  \n\n          Kellett suggests that the court  might have imposed\n\na more lenient sentence than it did if it had been aware that\n\nsenior  bank officers or directors had  known that false loan\n\napplications were  being submitted to the  bank for approval.\n\n                             -4-\n\nHe  claims that the court did  not sentence him with full and\n\naccurate  information  and  that  his   sentencing  therefore\n\nviolated his due process  rights.2  The sentencing transcript\n\nshows that the court believed that higher level bank officers\n\nmust  have  known that  false  loan  applications were  being\n\nsubmitted  to the bank.  Thus,  Kellett's suggestion that the\n\ncourt  was   unaware  of  this  fact   is  simply  incorrect.\n\nMoreover, the sentencing  transcript indicates that both  the\n\nprobation  department  and  the  court took  this  and  other\n\nfactors  into  account  by reducing  by  one  level the  base\n\noffense level assigned  to the loss amount in  Kellett's case\n\nby the  Sentencing Guidelines.   See U.S.S.G.    2F1.1(b)(1).\n                                    \n\nAccordingly, we  do not  think that the  prosecutor's alleged\n\nfailure  to disclose  evidence that  senior bank  officers or\n\ndirectors  knew  of  the  ongoing  scheme  renders  Kellett's\n\nsentencing constitutionally deficient.  \n\n          Kellett  further  claims   that  newly   discovered\n\nevidence  substantiates his  claim of  selective prosecution.\n\nAs  the  government  points out,  this  court  has held  that\n\nselective prosecution claims are  deemed waived if not raised\n\nprior to trial.   See Tracey v. United States,  739 F.2d 679,\n                                             \n\n682 (1st  Cir. 1984),  cert.  denied, 469  U.S. 1109  (1985).\n                                    \n\nPrior  to  his  trial,  Kellett sought  assurances  from  the\n\n                    \n\n2.  We assume for argument's sake, but without deciding, that\nthis claim survives dismissal on mootness grounds. \n\n                             -5-\n\nprosecutor   that   his  prosecution   was   not  politically\n\nmotivated,  evidencing his  awareness  that he  might have  a\n\nselective prosecution  claim.  But  he did not  challenge his\n\nprosecution on that basis by way of the requisite motion.  On\n\nappeal, Kellett says that the prosecutor assured him that his\n\nprosecution  was  not  politically   motivated.    The  newly\n\ndiscovered evidence he  refers to, however, has nothing to do\n\nwith those  assurances, but at most  supports the proposition\n\nthat certain  mall developers, whom  he had opposed  prior to\n\nhis  prosecution,  sought  to  ensure the  success  of  their\n\nproject by making  political contributions.   Accordingly, we\n\nfind the selective prosecution claim to be waived.\n\n          We find Kellett's remaining arguments to be without\n\nmerit for the reasons stated in the government's brief. \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -6-\n",

Abundant case law to the contrary undermines Kellett's claim.   See, e.g., United States v. Norberg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"372992\"><a href=\"/opinion/372992/united-states-v-colin-norberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1979) (the focus of the statute is that a false statement was made for the purpose of influencing the bank to take certain action;  the cases make clear that a bank's reliance on the false statement is irrelevant);   see also United States v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360204\"><a href=\"/opinion/360204/united-states-v-charles-glenn-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 125 (5th Cir. 1978) (The statute applies \"not only [to] a defendant who intends to defraud an unwitting insured institution but also [to] a defendant who intends to cooperate with the institution in a scheme requiring him, with the institution's knowledge, to make false statements for the furtherance of the scheme.  The [institution's] awareness of the fraud is not relevant, for its existence is not inconsistent with the intent to influence which a violator of Sec. 1014 must possess.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note further that, under section 1014, the critical knowledge is that possessed by the person making or causing the false statement to be made.  See United States v.  Concemi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578607\"><a href=\"/opinion/578607/united-states-v-samuel-j-concemi-united-states-of-america-v-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 951 (1st Cir. 1992) (among other things, the government must show that the defendant \"acted knowingly\" in making or causing a false statement be made to a federally insured bank).  Although Kellett suggests on appeal that the bank actually prepared the false documents, by pleading guilty he admitted that he had made or caused false statements to be made and that he knew the statements were false.  It is too late for Kellett to deny the factual basis of the charge to which he pled guilty.   See United States v. Morrison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564467\"><a href=\"/opinion/564467/united-states-v-marvin-j-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 171 (10th Cir. 1991) (in sentencing challenge, defendant could not assert facts contrary to those to which he pled guilty).  This is especially true since the \"fact\" in question is what Kellett himself knew about the accuracy of the statements in the loan documents.  Kellett must have known at the time he pled guilty whether or not he knew that the loan documents contained falsehoods which would influence the bank to approve the loans, and the state of knowledge of bank officers or directors had no bearing on that question.  Therefore, any failure by the prosecutor to tell Kellett what those officers or directors knew would provide no basis for permitting Kellett to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kellett suggests that the court might have imposed a more lenient sentence than it did if it had been aware that senior bank officers or directors had known that false loan applications were being submitted to the bank for approval.  He claims that the court did not sentence him with full and accurate information and that his sentencing therefore violated his due process rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The sentencing transcript shows that the court believed that higher level bank officers must have known that false loan applications were being submitted to the bank.  Thus, Kellett's suggestion that the court was unaware of this fact is simply incorrect.  Moreover, the sentencing transcript indicates that both the probation department and the court took this and other factors into account by reducing by one level the base offense level assigned to the loss amount in Kellett's case by the Sentencing Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1).  Accordingly, we do not think that the prosecutor's alleged failure to disclose evidence that senior bank officers or directors knew of the ongoing scheme renders Kellett's sentencing constitutionally deficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kellett further claims that newly discovered evidence substantiates his claim of selective prosecution.  As the government points out, this court has held that selective prosecution claims are deemed waived if not raised prior to trial.   See Tracey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439056\"><a href=\"/opinion/439056/francis-p-tracey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">679</span></a></span>, 682 (1st Cir. 1984), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1109</span></span> (1985).  Prior to his trial, Kellett sought assurances from the prosecutor that his prosecution was not politically motivated, evidencing his awareness that he might have a selective prosecution claim.  But he did not challenge his prosecution on that basis by way of the requisite motion.  On appeal, Kellett says that the prosecutor assured him that his prosecution was not politically motivated.  The newly discovered evidence he refers to, however, has nothing to do with those assurances, but at most supports the proposition that certain mall developers, whom he had opposed prior to his prosecution, sought to ensure the success of their project by making political contributions.  Accordingly, we find the selective prosecution claim to be waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Kellett's remaining arguments to be without merit for the reasons stated in the government's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We hereby grant the government's motion to withdraw its original appendix and to substitute an appendix excluding Kellett's presentence report.
