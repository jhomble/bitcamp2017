This is the second appearance here\n\nof a civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 brought by a group of\n\ntwenty-two contract employees against the Municipality of Aguada in\n\nPuerto Rico and two municipal officers.               See Acevedo-Feliciano v.\n\nRuiz-Hernández (Acevedo-Feliciano IV), 447 F.3d 115 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    That opinion, with which we assume familiarity, states the\n\nunderlying facts.\n\n            In the earlier phases of this case, before the appeal and\n\nremand, a jury rejected plaintiffs' claim that they suffered\n\npolitical party affiliation discrimination in violation of their\n\nFirst Amendment rights.          This left only one federal claim in the\n\ncase:    whether    plaintiffs    had,     on   the   facts   of    this   case,   a\n\nsufficient     property      interest      in    their    employment       by    the\n\nMunicipality       to   invoke   federal      constitutional       procedural    due\n\nprocess rights and whether those rights were violated.\n\n            Between June and September 2000, the (now-former) mayor\n\nof Aguada gave plaintiffs approximately one-year contracts of\n\nemployment with the Municipality, through June 30, 2001.                        These\n\ncontracts stated that plaintiffs' employment was \"by way\" of a\n\ngrant from the Commonwealth to the Municipality under Law 52. That\n\nlaw authorizes the Commonwealth to grant municipalities certain\n\nfunds to promote local employment.              See P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 29,\n\n§ 711c.     Law 52 funds initially paid for plaintiffs' salaries.\n\nAfter six months of funding under Law 52 ended on December 31,\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f2000, plaintiffs were paid for another month with municipal funds.\n\nThe Municipality terminated their employment on January 31, 2001,\n\nwithout notice or hearing, some five months shy of the expiration\n\nof their contracts.\n\n                 In order for plaintiffs to have procedural due process\n\nrights      in    their   employment,     each   plaintiff      must   have   had   a\n\nreasonable expectation, based on a statute, policy, rule, or\n\ncontract, that he or she would continue to be employed.                 See Wojcik\n\nv. Mass. State Lottery Comm'n, 300 F.3d 92, 101 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThese interests are commonly called \"property interests,\" and we\n\nlook   to    state     law   to   see   if    such   property   interests     exist.\n\nAcevedo-Feliciano IV, 447 F.3d at 121 (citing Bishop v. Wood, 426\n\nU.S. 341, 344 (1976)).            Whether these property interests rise to a\n\nlevel sufficient to trigger procedural due process protections\n\nremains a federal question.             Id.\n\n                 In our prior decision, we vacated the district court's\n\nentry of judgment in favor of defendants, which was based on its\n\ndetermination that \"either the Law 52 contract or municipal law\n\nrequired that each plaintiff's hiring contract be read to include\n\nthe implicit condition that the term of employment was conditioned\n\non the Municipality's receipt of Law 52 funding.\"                  Id. at 122.\n\n                 After a discussion of Law 52 and pertinent municipal law,\n\nwe held that this rationale was not dispositive or supported, that\n\nmore analysis was needed, and that Puerto Rican law on the subject\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwas unclear.      Id. at 122-24.    We vacated and remanded so the court\n\ncould address \"whether Puerto Rican law supplies any sort of\n\nproperty interest once the Law 52 funding ceased.\"             Id. at 124.\n\n            On remand, the district court directed both parties to\n\nfile cross-motions for summary judgment, granted summary judgment\n\nfor plaintiffs, and held an evidentiary hearing on related facts.\n\nThe district court held that on the undisputed facts, plaintiffs\n\nhad a continued expectation of employment even though the Law 52\n\nfunding had expired.     See Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández, 524\n\nF. Supp. 2d 150, 154 (D.P.R. 2007) (Acevedo-Feliciano V).                 It so\n\nheld because municipal law did not prohibit the Municipality from\n\nusing general funds to continue paying plaintiffs' salaries, and\n\nthe Municipality knew it had substantial uncommitted funds when it\n\nterminated plaintiffs' contracts.           Id. at 153-54.\n\n            The court further found that plaintiffs' expectation\n\nconstituted a property interest in continued employment cognizable\n\nunder the due process clause.       Id. at 154.    It also held that there\n\nwas no indication from defendants that there were any adequate\n\nstate remedies.      Id. at 154-55.      After a trial on damages, a jury\n\ngranted compensatory damages, punitive damages, and back pay to\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n            The   Municipality     and   the   individual    defendants    have\n\nappealed.    We address their contentions in turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f      I.   Denial of Certification to Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\n            After more than nine years of litigation, a prior appeal,\n\nand   having     lost   at    trial,    defendants        ask   that       questions    be\n\ncertified to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.                  The request is more\n\nthan a little late--it was not raised until after remand--and the\n\ndistrict    court       did    not     abuse     its    discretion          in     denying\n\ncertification. See U.S. Steel v. M. DeMatteo Constr. Co., 315 F.3d\n\n43, 53-54 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            In    addition      to   being      untimely,       the    two       questions\n\ndefendants ask to be certified are the wrong questions. Defendants\n\nsay the dispositive, unsettled questions of Puerto Rican law on the\n\nprocedural due process claim are (1) whether a one-year appointment\n\nmade under Law 52 creates a legitimate expectation of continued\n\nemployment for the entire year if, at the time of appointment, the\n\nLaw 52 allotment was only for six months; and (2) whether the\n\nMunicipality must continue funding those appointments from other\n\nfunds once Law 52 funds expire.\n\n            The     more     significant       question    of    Puerto      Rican     law\n\nnecessary to resolve plaintiffs' claim, however, is whether, under\n\nmunicipal    law,    the      Municipality      could     choose      to    use    general\n\nmunicipal funds to pay for Law 52 positions beyond the funding from\n\nthe Law 52 grant, so as to create a legitimate expectation of an\n\napproximately one-year appointment.               The district court held that\n\nthe Municipality was allowed, but not required, to do so under\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fmunicipal law. See Acevedo-Feliciano V, 542 F. Supp. 2d at 153-54.\n\nThe    remaining      questions    concerning      the    application   of     that\n\nprinciple to the facts of this case were for the federal court to\n\nresolve.      We decline to certify, and the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in declining to do so.\n\n           II.      Existence of Procedural Due Process Rights\n\n              The     district    court     granted      summary   judgment        for\n\nplaintiffs because it found as a matter of law that plaintiffs had\n\na property interest under state law, which was cognizable under the\n\ndue process clause, and that defendants deprived plaintiffs of that\n\nright without due process of law.                Id. at 155.       We review the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment de novo and will affirm\n\nif \"there is no genuine issue as to any issue of material fact and\n\n. . . the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\nAgusty-Reyes v. Dep't of Educ., 601 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n              There    are   no   contested      material    facts.     The    only\n\nquestions before us are legal ones, specifically (1) whether, based\n\non contractual, policy, or other sources derived from Puerto Rican\n\nlaw, plaintiffs had a property interest in continued employment\n\nwith    the      Municipality;       (2)    whether      that   interest      is    a\n\nconstitutionally protected right under the due process clause of\n\nthe federal Constitution; and (3) whether the Municipality deprived\n\nplaintiffs       of   that   right    without     providing     constitutionally\n\nadequate process.        See Maymi v. P.R. Ports Auth., 515 F.3d 20, 29\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f(1st Cir. 2008). Plaintiffs satisfied all these conditions, and we\n\naffirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in their\n\nfavor.\n\nA.        Existence of Property Interests\n\n          We first address whether plaintiffs had a reasonable\n\nexpectation of continued employment, based on their contracts,\n\nsurrounding Puerto Rican law, and the facts of the case.             We hold\n\nthat they did.\n\n          The     undisputed    facts1     established      that   when     the\n\nMunicipality     hired   plaintiffs,      the   contracts     committed     the\n\nMunicipality to employing plaintiffs for almost a year, through\n\nJune 30, 2001, though the Municipality knew that the Law 52 grant\n\nexpired on December 31, 2000, approximately six months into that\n\nperiod.\n\n          The    Municipality    also     had   the   power   to   commit    to\n\nemploying plaintiffs for their full contractual terms, despite the\n\nlimited duration of the Law 52 funds.             Law 52 does not, by its\n\nterms, prohibit municipalities from supplementing Law 52 monies\n\nwith municipal funds, see P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 29, § 711c, and the\n\nCommonwealth's    Law    52   agreement    with    the   Municipality     here\n\nspecifically provided that \"[i]f the Municipality offers to the\n\n\n     1\n          Contrary   to   defendants'   assertions,   because   the\nprocedural due process question was appropriately resolved on\nundisputed facts on summary judgment, there is no Seventh Amendment\nissue. See, e.g., Darr v. Town of Telluride, 495 F.3d 1243, 1252\n(10th Cir. 2007).\n\n                                    -7-\n\femployees other benefits which are not part of this agreement, the\n\nMunicipality assumes responsibility therefore and pays them with\n\nits funds.\"     Acevedo-Feliciano IV, 447 F.3d at 123.\n\n            Nor was the Municipality prohibited by law from making\n\nthis    commitment.    Indeed,    the    Autonomous   Municipalities   Act\n\nauthorizes the mayor to propose readjustments to the Municipality's\n\ngeneral expenses budget when there are anticipated surpluses.          See\n\nP.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 21, § 4309.\n\n            Further, it is undisputed that the Municipality acted in\n\nways to confirm plaintiffs' contractual expectations.            After the\n\nLaw 52 funds expired, the Municipality paid plaintiffs for some\n\nweeks out of municipal funds, confirming plaintiffs' expectation\n\nthat their employment would continue under their contracts even\n\nafter the Law 52 funds expired.         This is sufficient to show that\n\nplaintiffs had a property interest in continued employment under\n\nstate law.\n\nB.          Interests Cognizable as Procedural Due Process Rights\n\n            Plaintiffs' property interest in continued employment\n\nunder   their   approximately    one-year   contracts   is   a   recognized\n\nprocedural due process right. This circuit's law holds that a one-\n\nyear term of employment with Puerto Rican government bodies is\n\ngenerally considered a protected property interest for procedural\n\ndue process purposes.     See Acevedo-Feliciano IV, 447 F.3d at 121;\n\nCaro v. Aponte-Roque, 878 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fC.         Deprivation of Plaintiffs' Due Process Rights\n\n           Finally, we consider, and reject, defendants' argument\n\nthat plaintiffs were not deprived of protected property interests\n\nwithout due process of law because the process Puerto Rico provided\n\nwas adequate.\n\n           The plaintiffs' basic claim is that the Municipality\n\ndeprived them of their property interest in continued employment\n\npursuant to an official policy: the mayor, the Municipality's\n\nofficial   policymaker,   made    the    final   decision    to    terminate\n\nplaintiffs, and the parties stipulated before the district court\n\nthat no pre-termination hearing was provided.\n\n           Defendants   advance    two    arguments   as    to    why   state\n\nprocesses provided plaintiffs with all the process they were due.\n\nFirst, defendants say that, in practice, the Municipality provided\n\nplaintiffs with all the process they were due because plaintiffs\n\nwere given notice and a collective opportunity to comment on their\n\ntermination in the meeting where they were handed their termination\n\nnotices.   That argument is foreclosed by our earlier conclusion,\n\nbased on the parties' previous submissions before this court, that\n\n\"none of the plaintiffs were granted a pre-termination hearing.\"\n\nAcevedo-Feliciano IV, 447 F.3d at 118-19.\n\n           Second, defendants say that under Parratt v. Taylor, 451\n\nU.S. 527 (1981), and its progeny, plaintiffs cannot make out a\n\n§ 1983 claim without showing the inadequacy of existing state\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fremedies, and that plaintiffs have failed to carry that burden.\n\nDefendants rely on cases involving random and unauthorized state\n\ndeprivations of property interests, in which a pre-termination\n\nhearing is, by definition, infeasible and the question becomes\n\nwhether    the   state's    post-deprivation        processes    are   enough   to\n\nprotect    plaintiffs'      rights.          See,    e.g.,      Chmielinski     v.\n\nMassachusetts, 513 F.3d 309, 315 (1st Cir. 2008).               That is plainly\n\nnot the kind of violation alleged here.2\n\n             III.    Claims against Individual Defendants\n\nA.          Qualified Immunity\n\n            Though the individual defendants repeatedly asserted that\n\nthey were entitled to qualified immunity both before and after the\n\nremand,    the   district   court   did   not   address      this   question    on\n\nremand.3    Instead, having granted plaintiffs summary judgment on\n\n     2\n          Nor is this a case in which plaintiffs sought to\nvindicate a right that had elapsed before suit was filed. Rather,\nplaintiffs were \"denied a right by virtue of which [they were]\npresently entitled . . . to pursue a gainful occupation,\" and that\nright cannot \"be fully protected by an ordinary breach-of-contract\nsuit.\"   Lujan v. G&G Fire Sprinklers, Inc., 532 U.S. 189, 196\n(2001).\n     3\n          In August 2002, during the initial stages of this case,\nthe district court deemed one effort by the individual defendants\nto present the qualified immunity question at summary judgment to\nbe untimely due to failure to comply with the court's deadlines.\nSee Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández (Acevedo-Feliciano I), No.\n01-1445 (D.P.R. Aug. 16, 2002) (order denying defendants' motion\nfor summary judgment). On an interlocutory appeal, we affirmed the\nuntimeliness ruling on February 3, 2003.       We added that \"the\nqualified immunity defense, if properly asserted in the defendants'\npleadings and otherwise properly maintained and presented, will\nstill be available at trial; the only consequence of the district\ncourt's refusal to entertain the summary judgment motion on the\n\n                                      -10-\n\ftheir procedural due process claim, the district court held that\n\nthe only remaining issue was to determine how much the Municipality\n\nand the individual defendants owed plaintiffs in damages.4              See\n\nAcevedo-Feliciano V, 542 F. Supp. 2d at 155.\n\n           We hold that the individual defendants are entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.    Even when plaintiffs make out a violation of\n\na   constitutional   right,   officials   are   entitled   to   qualified\n\nimmunity unless that right was also \"clearly established at the\n\ntime of [their] alleged misconduct.\"      Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S.\n\nCt. 808, 816 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).         Whether a\n\nright is clearly established in turn depends on the clarity of the\n\nlaw at the time of the violation and whether, on the facts of the\n\ncase, a reasonable official would know that his actions violated\n\nplaintiffs'   constitutional    rights.     See   Walden   v.    City   of\n\n\nqualified immunity question has been to preclude a pretrial\nresolution of the issue.\" See Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández\n(Acevedo-Feliciano II), No. 02-2287 (1st Cir. Feb. 3, 2003)\n(unpublished judgment).\n     Defendants took all steps necessary to preserve this claim.\nThey again raised it in their April 4, 2003, motion for judgment as\na matter of law before the first jury trial, see Acevedo-Feliciano\nv. Ruiz-Hernández (Acevedo-Feliciano III), 275 F. Supp. 2d 162,\n164, 167-68 (D.P.R. 2003) (denying defendants qualified immunity on\nthe First Amendment claim but avoiding the question on the due\nprocess claim by holding that plaintiffs had no procedural due\nprocess right in continued employment). They also raised it after\nremand in their motion for summary judgment on the procedural due\nprocess claim, in their motion for judgment as a matter of law, and\nin their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n      4\n          To the extent that plaintiffs claim otherwise, nothing in\nour prior decision precluded the individual defendants from\ncontinuing to assert, on remand, that they were entitled to\nqualified immunity.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fProvidence, 596 F.3d 38, 53 (1st Cir. 2010).                           We hold that the\n\nindividual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because\n\nthe   defendants       could    not      have    reasonably        known     in    2001   that\n\nplaintiffs had a constitutionally protected right under the due\n\nprocess clause.\n\n              Our previous decision established that Puerto Rico law\n\nwas unclear as to whether plaintiffs had any rights to continued\n\nemployment once the Law 52 funding ended.                         See Acevedo-Feliciano\n\nIV, 447 F.3d at 124.           The various pleadings submitted on municipal\n\nlaw at summary judgment amply demonstrate the lack of clarity.\n\nIndeed, the district court had originally concluded that Puerto\n\nRican law established that plaintiffs had no such rights, see\n\nAcevedo-Feliciano        III,      275    F.     Supp.      2d.   at   166-67,      and   then\n\nreversed that determination on remand, see Acevedo-Feliciano V, 524\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 152-54, relying in both instances on roughly the\n\nsame provisions of Commonwealth and municipal law.                                 Given the\n\nintricate      maze     of   Commonwealth             and    municipal       law   regarding\n\nemployment under Law 52, no reasonable official would have known,\n\nin    2001,   that     terminating        plaintiffs'          approximately        one-year\n\ncontracts      because       Law    52     funds       had    expired      would      violate\n\nplaintiffs' procedural due process rights.\n\n              Because    the       individual         defendants       are     entitled    to\n\nimmunity, we vacate the judgment against them and remand with\n\ninstructions      to     dismiss         all     claims      against     the       individual\n\n\n\n                                               -12-\n\fdefendants with prejudice.       This ruling does not, however, affect\n\nthe Municipality's liability.       See Walden, 596 F.3d at 55 n.23.\n\nB.         Award of Punitive Damages\n\n           The jury awarded punitive damages to each of the twenty-\n\ntwo plaintiffs in the sum of $15,000 each, which was allotted as\n\n$7,500 against each of the two individual defendants.                 It was\n\nerror, indeed plain error, to submit this issue to the jury.\n\n           Punitive damages in a § 1983 civil rights action can be\n\ngranted at the jury's discretion only if \"the defendant's conduct\n\nis shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it\n\ninvolves   reckless   or    callous   indifference     to   the     federally\n\nprotected rights of others.\"          Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56\n\n(1983).    This   court    has   \"emphasized   that   the   'evil    motive,'\n\n'intent,' or 'reckless or callous indifference' pertains to the\n\n'defendant's knowledge that [he] may be acting in violation of\n\nfederal law.'\"    Davignon v. Hodgson, 524 F.3d 91, 110 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (alteration in original) (quoting Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193\n\nF.3d 14, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n           Puerto Rican law was unclear as to whether plaintiffs had\n\na right to continued employment and so whether any constitutionally\n\nprotected interest was involved at all.         Given the complexity of\n\nthe Commonwealth and municipal law at issue, it cannot logically be\n\ntrue that the individual defendants knew they may have been acting\n\nin violation of federal law.       We vacate the punitive damages award\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fand order dismissal of the punitive damages claim with prejudice on\n\nremand.\n\n           IV.   Award of Damages against the Municipality\n\n           As to each of the twenty-two plaintiffs, the jury awarded\n\n$15,000 in compensatory (\"suffering and anguish\") damages and\n\n$4,960 for back pay jointly and severally against defendants.    We\n\nneed not determine whether this is the appropriate measure of\n\ndamages for a procedural due process violation; it is enough that\n\nthe Municipality has never challenged it.\n\n           Indeed, the Municipality's only challenge to the back pay\n\naward is a specific argument that the award improperly included for\n\neach plaintiff a $500 Christmas bonus for 2001.   There was no error\n\nin the district court's denial of remittitur on these grounds.\n\nPlaintiffs had a property interest in their employment through June\n\n30, 2001, and under Puerto Rican law, any employee who works for\n\nthe government for at least six months of a calendar year is\n\nentitled to an annual Christmas bonus.   See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3,\n\n§ 757.    There was sufficient evidence to support the award of the\n\nbonus.\n\n           We have considered the rest of the arguments made by each\n\nside and either have no need to reach them or have concluded they\n\nare without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f                              V. Conclusion\n\n          We vacate the judgments against the individual defendants\n\nincluding the punitive damages award against them.         We remand with\n\ninstructions   to   dismiss    all     claims   against   the   individual\n\ndefendants with prejudice.      Otherwise, the judgment against the\n\nMunicipality is affirmed.     No costs are awarded.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f",

Peñagarícano-Brown, Assistant Solicitor General, with whom Irene S. Soroeta-Kodesh, Solicitor General, Leticia Casalduc-Rabell, Deputy Solicitor General, and Zaira Z. Girón-Anadón, Deputy Solicitor General, were on brief for appellants Miguel A. Ruiz-Hernández and Glenda L. Peña-Muñoz, in their personal capacities.</p>\n<p>Lizabel M.

Aldarondo-Lopez and Aldarondo &amp; López Bras, were on brief for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>This is the second appearance here of a civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 brought by a group of twenty-two contract employees against the Municipality of Aguada in Puerto Rico and two municipal officers. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández (Acevedo-Feliciano IV),</i> 447 F.3d 115 (1st Cir.2006). That opinion, with which we assume familiarity, states the underlying facts.</p>\n<p>In the earlier phases of this case, before the appeal and remand, a jury rejected plaintiffs' claim that they suffered political party affiliation discrimination in violation of their First Amendment rights. This left only one federal claim in the case: whether plaintiffs had, on the facts of this case, a sufficient property interest in their employment by the Municipality to invoke federal constitutional procedural due process <span class=\"star-pagination\">*264</span> rights and whether those rights were violated.</p>\n<p>Between June and September 2000, the (now-former) mayor of Aguada gave plaintiffs approximately one-year contracts of employment with the Municipality, through June 30, 2001. These contracts stated that plaintiffs' employment was \"by way\" of a grant from the Commonwealth to the Municipality under Law 52. That law authorizes the Commonwealth to grant municipalities certain funds to promote local employment. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 29, § 711c. Law 52 funds initially paid for plaintiffs' salaries. After six months of funding under Law 52 ended on December 31, 2000, plaintiffs were paid for another month with municipal funds. The Municipality terminated their employment on January 31, 2001, without notice or hearing, some five months shy of the expiration of their contracts.</p>\n<p>In order for plaintiffs to have procedural due process rights in their employment, each plaintiff must have had a reasonable expectation, based on a statute, policy, rule, or contract, that he or she would continue to be employed. <i>See </i><i>Wojcik v. Mass. State Lottery Comm'n,</i> 300 F.3d 92, 101 (1st Cir.2002). These interests are commonly called \"property interests,\" and we look to state law to see if such property interests exist. <i>Acevedo-Feliciano IV,</i> 447 F.3d at 121 (citing <i>Bishop v. Wood,</i> 426 U.S. 341, 344, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976)). Whether these property interests rise to a level sufficient to trigger procedural due process protections remains a federal question. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In our prior decision, we vacated the district court's entry of judgment in favor of defendants, which was based on its determination that \"either the Law 52 contract or municipal law required that each plaintiff's hiring contract be read to include the implicit condition that the term of employment was conditioned on the Municipality's receipt of Law 52 funding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 122.</p>\n<p>After a discussion of Law 52 and pertinent municipal law, we held that this rationale was not dispositive or supported, that more analysis was needed, and that Puerto Rican law on the subject was unclear. <i>Id.</i> at 122-24. We vacated and remanded so the court could address \"whether Puerto Rican law supplies any sort of property interest once the Law 52 funding ceased.\" <i>Id.</i> at 124.</p>\n<p>On remand, the district court directed both parties to file cross-motions for summary judgment, granted summary judgment for plaintiffs, and held an evidentiary hearing on related facts. The district court held that on the undisputed facts, plaintiffs had a continued expectation of employment even though the Law 52 funding had expired. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández,</i> 524 F.Supp.2d 150, 154 (D.P.R.2007) (<i>Acevedo-Feliciano V</i>). It so held because municipal law did not prohibit the Municipality from using general funds to continue paying plaintiffs' salaries, and the Municipality knew it had substantial uncommitted funds when it terminated plaintiffs' contracts. <i>Id.</i> at 153-54.</p>\n<p>The court further found that plaintiffs' expectation constituted a property interest in continued employment cognizable underM the due process clause. <i>Id.</i> at 154. It also held that there was no indication from defendants that there were any adequate state remedies. <i>Id.</i> at 154-55. After a trial on damages, a jury granted compensatory damages, punitive damages, and back pay to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>The Municipality and the individual defendants have appealed. We address their contentions in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*265</span> I. <i>Denial of Certification to Puerto Rico Supreme Court</i>\n</h2>\n<p>After more than nine years of litigation, a prior appeal, and having lost at trial, defendants ask that questions be certified to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. The request is more than a little lateit was not raised until after remandand the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying certification. <i>See </i><i>U.S. Steel v. M. DeMatteo Constr. Co.,</i> 315 F.3d 43, 53-54 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>In addition to being untimely, the two questions defendants ask to be certified are the wrong questions. Defendants say the dispositive, unsettled questions of Puerto Rican law on the procedural due process claim are (1) whether a one-year appointment made under Law 52 creates a legitimate expectation of continued employment for the entire year if, at the time of appointment, the Law 52 allotment was only for six months; and (2) whether the Municipality must continue funding those appointments from other funds once Law 52 funds expire.</p>\n<p>The more significant question of Puerto Rican law necessary to resolve plaintiffs' claim, however, is whether, under municipal law, the Municipality could <i>choose</i> to use general municipal funds to pay for Law 52 positions beyond the funding from the Law 52 grant, so as to create a legitimate expectation of an approximately one-year appointment. The district court held that the Municipality was allowed, but not required, to do so under municipal law. <i>See Acevedo-Feliciano V,</i> 542 F.Supp.2d at 153-54. The remaining questions concerning the application of that principle to the facts of this case were for the federal court to resolve. We decline to certify, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Existence of Procedural Due Process Rights</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs because it found as a matter of law that plaintiffs had a property interest under state law, which was cognizable under the due process clause, and that defendants deprived plaintiffs of that right without due process of law. <i>Id.</i> at 155. We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and will affirm if \"there is no genuine issue as to any issue of material fact and. . . the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Agusty-Reyes v. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 601 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>There are no contested material facts. The only questions before us are legal ones, specifically (1) whether, based on contractual, policy, or other sources derived from Puerto Rican law, plaintiffs had a property interest in continued employment with the Municipality; (2) whether that interest is a constitutionally protected right under the due process clause of the federal Constitution; and (3) whether the Municipality deprived plaintiffs of that right without providing constitutionally adequate process. <i>See </i><i>Maymi v. P.R. Ports Auth.,</i> 515 F.3d 20, 29 (1st Cir.2008). Plaintiffs satisfied all these conditions, and we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Existence of Property Interests</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We first address whether plaintiffs had a reasonable expectation of continued employment, based on their contracts, surrounding Puerto Rican law, and the facts of the case. We hold that they did.</p>\n<p>The undisputed facts<sup>[1]</sup> established that when the Municipality hired plaintiffs, the contracts committed the Municipality to employing plaintiffs for almost a year, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> through June 30, 2001, though the Municipality knew that the Law 52 grant expired on December 31, 2000, approximately six months into that period.</p>\n<p>The Municipality also had the power to commit to employing plaintiffs for their full contractual terms, despite the limited duration of the Law 52 funds. Law 52 does not, by its terms, prohibit municipalities from supplementing Law 52 monies with municipal funds, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 29, § 711c, and the Commonwealth's Law 52 agreement with the Municipality here specifically provided that \"[i]f the Municipality offers to the employees other benefits which are not part of this agreement, the Municipality assumes responsibility therefore and pays them with its funds.\" <i>Acevedo-Feliciano IV,</i> 447 F.3d at 123.</p>\n<p>Nor was the Municipality prohibited by law from making this commitment. Indeed, the Autonomous Municipalities Act authorizes the mayor to propose readjustments to the Municipality's general expenses budget when there are anticipated surpluses. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 21, § 4309.</p>\n<p>Further, it is undisputed that the Municipality acted in ways to confirm plaintiffs' contractual expectations. After the Law 52 funds expired, the Municipality paid plaintiffs for some weeks out of municipal funds, confirming plaintiffs' expectation that their employment would continue under their contracts even after the Law 52 funds expired. This is sufficient to show that plaintiffs had a property interest in continued employment under state law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Interests Cognizable as Procedural Due Process Rights</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs' property interest in continued employment under their approximately one-year contracts is a recognized procedural due process right. This circuit's law holds that a one-year term of employment with Puerto Rican government bodies is generally considered a protected property interest for procedural due process purposes. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano IV,</i> 447 F.3d at 121; <i>Caro v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 878 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Deprivation of Plaintiffs' Due Process Rights</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, we consider, and reject, defendants' argument that plaintiffs were not deprived of protected property interests without due process of law because the process Puerto Rico provided was adequate.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' basic claim is that the Municipality deprived them of their property interest in continued employment pursuant to an official policy: the mayor, the Municipality's official policymaker, made the final decision to terminate plaintiffs, and the parties stipulated before the district court that no pre-termination hearing was provided.</p>\n<p>Defendants advance two arguments as to why state processes provided plaintiffs with all the process they were due. First, defendants say that, in practice, the Municipality provided plaintiffs with all the process they were due because plaintiffs were given notice and a collective opportunity to comment on their termination in the meeting where they were handed their termination notices. That argument is foreclosed by our earlier conclusion, based on the parties' previous submissions before this court, that \"none of the plaintiffs were granted a pre-termination hearing.\" <i>Acevedo-Feliciano IV,</i> 447 F.3d at 118-19.</p>\n<p>Second, defendants say that under <i>Parratt v. Taylor,</i> 451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), and its progeny, plaintiffs cannot make out a § 1983 claim without showing the inadequacy of existing state remedies, and that plaintiffs have failed to carry that burden. Defendants rely on cases involving random and unauthorized state deprivations of property interests, in which a pre-termination hearing is, by definition, infeasible and the question becomes whether the state's post-deprivation processes are enough to protect plaintiffs' rights. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Chmielinski v. Massachusetts,</i> 513 F.3d 309, 315 (1st Cir.2008). That is plainly not the kind of violation alleged here.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Claims against Individual Defendants</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Qualified Immunity</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Though the individual defendants repeatedly asserted that they were entitled to qualified immunity both before and after the remand, the district court did not address this question on remand.<sup>[3]</sup> Instead, having granted plaintiffs summary judgment on their procedural due process claim, the district court held that the only remaining issue was to determine how much the Municipality and the individual defendants owed plaintiffs in damages.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See Acevedo-Feliciano V,</i> 542 F.Supp.2d at 155.</p>\n<p>We hold that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. Even when plaintiffs make out a violation of a constitutional right, officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless that right was also \"clearly established at the time of [their] alleged misconduct.\" <i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 816, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> right is clearly established in turn depends on the clarity of the law at the time of the violation and whether, on the facts of the case, a reasonable official would know that his actions violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights. <i>See Walden v. City of Providence,</i> 596 F.3d 38, 53 (1st Cir.2010). We hold that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because the defendants could not have reasonably known in 2001 that plaintiffs had a constitutionally protected right under the due process clause.</p>\n<p>Our previous decision established that Puerto Rico law was unclear as to whether plaintiffs had any rights to continued employment once the Law 52 funding ended. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano IV,</i> 447 F.3d at 124. The various pleadings submitted on municipal law at summary judgment amply demonstrate the lack of clarity. Indeed, the district court had originally concluded that Puerto Rican law established that plaintiffs had no such rights, <i>see Acevedo-Feliciano III,</i> 275 F.Supp.2d. at 166-67, and then reversed that determination on remand, <i>see </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano V,</i> 524 F.Supp.2d at 152-54, relying in both instances on roughly the same provisions of Commonwealth and municipal law. Given the intricate maze of Commonwealth and municipal law regarding employment under Law 52, no reasonable official would have known, in 2001, that terminating plaintiffs' approximately one-year contracts because Law 52 funds had expired would violate plaintiffs' procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p>Because the individual defendants are entitled to immunity, we vacate the judgment against them and remand with instructions to dismiss all claims against the individual defendants with prejudice. This ruling does not, however, affect the Municipality's liability. <i>See Walden,</i> 596 F.3d at 55 n. 23.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Award of Punitive Damages</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The jury awarded punitive damages to each of the twenty-two plaintiffs in the sum of $15,000 each, which was allotted as $7,500 against each of the two individual defendants. It was error, indeed plain error, to submit this issue to the jury.</p>\n<p>Punitive damages in a § 1983 civil rights action can be granted at the jury's discretion only if \"the defendant's conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.\" <i>Smith v. Wade,</i> 461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983). This court has \"emphasized that the `evil motive,' `intent,' or `reckless or callous indifference' pertains to the `<i>defendant's knowledge that [he] may be acting in violation of federal law.</i>'\" <i>Davignon v. Hodgson,</i> 524 F.3d 91, 110 (1st Cir.2008) (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Iacobucci v. Boulter,</i> 193 F.3d 14, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p>Puerto Rican law was unclear as to whether plaintiffs had a right to continued employment and so whether any constitutionally protected interest was involved at all. Given the complexity of the Commonwealth and municipal law at issue, it cannot logically be true that the individual defendants knew they may have been acting in violation of federal law. We vacate the punitive damages award and order dismissal of the punitive damages claim with prejudice on remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>Award of Damages against the Municipality</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As to each of the twenty-two plaintiffs, the jury awarded $15,000 in compensatory (\"suffering and anguish\") damages and $4,960 for back pay jointly and severally against defendants. We need not determine whether this is the appropriate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*269</span> measure of damages for a procedural due process violation; it is enough that the Municipality has never challenged it.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Municipality's only challenge to the back pay award is a specific argument that the award improperly included for each plaintiff a $500 Christmas bonus for 2001. There was no error in the district court's denial of remittitur on these grounds. Plaintiffs had a property interest in their employment through June 30, 2001, and under Puerto Rican law, any employee who works for the government for at least six months of a calendar year is entitled to an annual Christmas bonus. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 757. There was sufficient evidence to support the award of the bonus.</p>\n<p>We have considered the rest of the arguments made by each side and either have no need to reach them or have concluded they are without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We <i>vacate</i> the judgments against the individual defendants including the punitive damages award against them. We <i>remand</i> with instructions to dismiss all claims against the individual defendants with prejudice. Otherwise, the judgment against the Municipality is <i>affirmed.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Contrary to defendants' assertions, because the procedural due process question was appropriately resolved on undisputed facts on summary judgment, there is no Seventh Amendment issue. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Darr v. Town of Telluride,</i> 495 F.3d 1243, 1252 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p>[2]  Nor is this a case in which plaintiffs sought to vindicate a right that had elapsed before suit was filed. Rather, plaintiffs were \"denied a right by virtue of which [they were] presently entitled . . . to pursue a gainful occupation,\" and that right cannot \"be fully protected by an ordinary breach-of-contract suit.\" <i>Lujan v.

Ruiz-Hernández (Acevedo-Feliciano I),</i> No. 01-1445 (D.P.R. Aug. 16, 2002) (order denying defendants' motion for summary judgment). On an interlocutory appeal, we affirmed the untimeliness ruling on February 3, 2003. We added that \"the qualified immunity defense, if properly asserted in the defendants' pleadings and otherwise properly maintained and presented, will still be available at trial; the only consequence of the district court's refusal to entertain the summary judgment motion on the qualified immunity question has been to preclude a pretrial resolution of the issue.\" <i>See Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández (Acevedo-Feliciano II),</i> No. 02-2287 (1st Cir. Feb. 3, 2003) (unpublished judgment).\n</p>\n<p>Defendants took all steps necessary to preserve this claim.

They also raised it after remand in their motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim, in their motion for judgment as a matter of law, and in their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p>[4]  To the extent that plaintiffs claim otherwise, nothing in our prior decision precluded the individual defendants from continuing to assert, on remand, that they were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n\n</div>",

Ruiz-Hernández (Acevedo-Feliciano IV),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202208\"><a href=\"/opinion/202208/acevedo-feliciano-v-ruiz-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2006). That opinion, with which we assume familiarity, states the underlying facts.</p>\n<p>In the earlier phases of this case, before the appeal and remand, a jury rejected plaintiffs' claim that they suffered political party affiliation discrimination in violation of their First Amendment rights. This left only one federal claim in the case: whether plaintiffs had, on the facts of this case, a sufficient property interest in their employment by the Municipality to invoke federal constitutional procedural due process <span class=\"star-pagination\">*264</span> rights and whether those rights were violated.</p>\n<p>Between June and September 2000, the (now-former) mayor of Aguada gave plaintiffs approximately one-year contracts of employment with the Municipality, through June 30, 2001. These contracts stated that plaintiffs' employment was \"by way\" of a grant from the Commonwealth to the Municipality under Law 52. That law authorizes the Commonwealth to grant municipalities certain funds to promote local employment. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 29, § 711c. Law 52 funds initially paid for plaintiffs' salaries. After six months of funding under Law 52 ended on December 31, 2000, plaintiffs were paid for another month with municipal funds. The Municipality terminated their employment on January 31, 2001, without notice or hearing, some five months shy of the expiration of their contracts.</p>\n<p>In order for plaintiffs to have procedural due process rights in their employment, each plaintiff must have had a reasonable expectation, based on a statute, policy, rule, or contract, that he or she would continue to be employed. <i>See </i><i>Wojcik v. Mass. State Lottery Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200086\"><a href=\"/opinion/200086/wojcik-v-massachusetts-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 101 (1st Cir.2002). These interests are commonly called \"property interests,\" and we look to state law to see if such property interests exist. <i>Acevedo-Feliciano IV,</i> 447 F.3d at 121 (citing <i>Bishop v. Wood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109476\"><a href=\"/opinion/109476/bishop-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 344, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109476\"><a href=\"/opinion/109476/bishop-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span> (1976)). Whether these property interests rise to a level sufficient to trigger procedural due process protections remains a federal question. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In our prior decision, we vacated the district court's entry of judgment in favor of defendants, which was based on its determination that \"either the Law 52 contract or municipal law required that each plaintiff's hiring contract be read to include the implicit condition that the term of employment was conditioned on the Municipality's receipt of Law 52 funding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 122.</p>\n<p>After a discussion of Law 52 and pertinent municipal law, we held that this rationale was not dispositive or supported, that more analysis was needed, and that Puerto Rican law on the subject was unclear. <i>Id.</i> at 122-24. We vacated and remanded so the court could address \"whether Puerto Rican law supplies any sort of property interest once the Law 52 funding ceased.\" <i>Id.</i> at 124.</p>\n<p>On remand, the district court directed both parties to file cross-motions for summary judgment, granted summary judgment for plaintiffs, and held an evidentiary hearing on related facts. The district court held that on the undisputed facts, plaintiffs had a continued expectation of employment even though the Law 52 funding had expired. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2442381\"><a href=\"/opinion/2442381/acevedo-feliciano-v-ruiz-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span>, 154 (D.P.R.2007) (<i>Acevedo-Feliciano V</i>). It so held because municipal law did not prohibit the Municipality from using general funds to continue paying plaintiffs' salaries, and the Municipality knew it had substantial uncommitted funds when it terminated plaintiffs' contracts. <i>Id.</i> at 153-54.</p>\n<p>The court further found that plaintiffs' expectation constituted a property interest in continued employment cognizable underM the due process clause. <i>Id.</i> at 154. It also held that there was no indication from defendants that there were any adequate state remedies. <i>Id.</i> at 154-55. After a trial on damages, a jury granted compensatory damages, punitive damages, and back pay to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>The Municipality and the individual defendants have appealed. We address their contentions in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*265</span> I. <i>Denial of Certification to Puerto Rico Supreme Court</i>\n</h2>\n<p>After more than nine years of litigation, a prior appeal, and having lost at trial, defendants ask that questions be certified to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. The request is more than a little lateit was not raised until after remandand the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying certification. <i>See </i><i>U.S. Steel v. M. DeMatteo Constr. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200257\"><a href=\"/opinion/200257/united-states-steel-v-m-dematteo/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 53-54 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>In addition to being untimely, the two questions defendants ask to be certified are the wrong questions. Defendants say the dispositive, unsettled questions of Puerto Rican law on the procedural due process claim are (1) whether a one-year appointment made under Law 52 creates a legitimate expectation of continued employment for the entire year if, at the time of appointment, the Law 52 allotment was only for six months; and (2) whether the Municipality must continue funding those appointments from other funds once Law 52 funds expire.</p>\n<p>The more significant question of Puerto Rican law necessary to resolve plaintiffs' claim, however, is whether, under municipal law, the Municipality could <i>choose</i> to use general municipal funds to pay for Law 52 positions beyond the funding from the Law 52 grant, so as to create a legitimate expectation of an approximately one-year appointment. The district court held that the Municipality was allowed, but not required, to do so under municipal law. <i>See Acevedo-Feliciano V,</i> 542 F.Supp.2d at 153-54. The remaining questions concerning the application of that principle to the facts of this case were for the federal court to resolve. We decline to certify, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Existence of Procedural Due Process Rights</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs because it found as a matter of law that plaintiffs had a property interest under state law, which was cognizable under the due process clause, and that defendants deprived plaintiffs of that right without due process of law. <i>Id.</i> at 155. We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and will affirm if \"there is no genuine issue as to any issue of material fact and. . . the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Agusty-Reyes v. Dep't of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1257\"><a href=\"/opinion/1257/agusty-reyes-v-dept-of-educ-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>There are no contested material facts. The only questions before us are legal ones, specifically (1) whether, based on contractual, policy, or other sources derived from Puerto Rican law, plaintiffs had a property interest in continued employment with the Municipality; (2) whether that interest is a constitutionally protected right under the due process clause of the federal Constitution; and (3) whether the Municipality deprived plaintiffs of that right without providing constitutionally adequate process. <i>See </i><i>Maymi v. P.R. Ports Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203123\"><a href=\"/opinion/203123/maymi-v-puerto-rico-ports-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2008). Plaintiffs satisfied all these conditions, and we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Existence of Property Interests</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We first address whether plaintiffs had a reasonable expectation of continued employment, based on their contracts, surrounding Puerto Rican law, and the facts of the case. We hold that they did.</p>\n<p>The undisputed facts<sup>[1]</sup> established that when the Municipality hired plaintiffs, the contracts committed the Municipality to employing plaintiffs for almost a year, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> through June 30, 2001, though the Municipality knew that the Law 52 grant expired on December 31, 2000, approximately six months into that period.</p>\n<p>The Municipality also had the power to commit to employing plaintiffs for their full contractual terms, despite the limited duration of the Law 52 funds. Law 52 does not, by its terms, prohibit municipalities from supplementing Law 52 monies with municipal funds, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 29, § 711c, and the Commonwealth's Law 52 agreement with the Municipality here specifically provided that \"[i]f the Municipality offers to the employees other benefits which are not part of this agreement, the Municipality assumes responsibility therefore and pays them with its funds.\" <i>Acevedo-Feliciano IV,</i> 447 F.3d at 123.</p>\n<p>Nor was the Municipality prohibited by law from making this commitment. Indeed, the Autonomous Municipalities Act authorizes the mayor to propose readjustments to the Municipality's general expenses budget when there are anticipated surpluses. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 21, § 4309.</p>\n<p>Further, it is undisputed that the Municipality acted in ways to confirm plaintiffs' contractual expectations. After the Law 52 funds expired, the Municipality paid plaintiffs for some weeks out of municipal funds, confirming plaintiffs' expectation that their employment would continue under their contracts even after the Law 52 funds expired. This is sufficient to show that plaintiffs had a property interest in continued employment under state law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Interests Cognizable as Procedural Due Process Rights</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs' property interest in continued employment under their approximately one-year contracts is a recognized procedural due process right. This circuit's law holds that a one-year term of employment with Puerto Rican government bodies is generally considered a protected property interest for procedural due process purposes. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano IV,</i> 447 F.3d at 121; <i>Caro v. Aponte-Roque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525270\"><a href=\"/opinion/525270/angel-l-caro-v-awilda-aponte-roque-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Deprivation of Plaintiffs' Due Process Rights</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, we consider, and reject, defendants' argument that plaintiffs were not deprived of protected property interests without due process of law because the process Puerto Rico provided was adequate.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' basic claim is that the Municipality deprived them of their property interest in continued employment pursuant to an official policy: the mayor, the Municipality's official policymaker, made the final decision to terminate plaintiffs, and the parties stipulated before the district court that no pre-termination hearing was provided.</p>\n<p>Defendants advance two arguments as to why state processes provided plaintiffs with all the process they were due. First, defendants say that, in practice, the Municipality provided plaintiffs with all the process they were due because plaintiffs were given notice and a collective opportunity to comment on their termination in the meeting where they were handed their termination notices. That argument is foreclosed by our earlier conclusion, based on the parties' previous submissions before this court, that \"none of the plaintiffs were granted a pre-termination hearing.\" <i>Acevedo-Feliciano IV,</i> 447 F.3d at 118-19.</p>\n<p>Second, defendants say that under <i>Parratt v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110478\"><a href=\"/opinion/110478/parratt-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 101 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> 1908, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110478\"><a href=\"/opinion/110478/parratt-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span> (1981), and its progeny, plaintiffs cannot make out a § 1983 claim without showing the inadequacy of existing state remedies, and that plaintiffs have failed to carry that burden. Defendants rely on cases involving random and unauthorized state deprivations of property interests, in which a pre-termination hearing is, by definition, infeasible and the question becomes whether the state's post-deprivation processes are enough to protect plaintiffs' rights. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Chmielinski v. Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203111\"><a href=\"/opinion/203111/chmielinski-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span>, 315 (1st Cir.2008). That is plainly not the kind of violation alleged here.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Claims against Individual Defendants</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Qualified Immunity</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Though the individual defendants repeatedly asserted that they were entitled to qualified immunity both before and after the remand, the district court did not address this question on remand.<sup>[3]</sup> Instead, having granted plaintiffs summary judgment on their procedural due process claim, the district court held that the only remaining issue was to determine how much the Municipality and the individual defendants owed plaintiffs in damages.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See Acevedo-Feliciano V,</i> 542 F.Supp.2d at 155.</p>\n<p>We hold that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. Even when plaintiffs make out a violation of a constitutional right, officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless that right was also \"clearly established at the time of [their] alleged misconduct.\" <i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span>, 816, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span> (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> right is clearly established in turn depends on the clarity of the law at the time of the violation and whether, on the facts of the case, a reasonable official would know that his actions violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights. <i>See Walden v. City of Providence,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2010). We hold that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because the defendants could not have reasonably known in 2001 that plaintiffs had a constitutionally protected right under the due process clause.</p>\n<p>Our previous decision established that Puerto Rico law was unclear as to whether plaintiffs had any rights to continued employment once the Law 52 funding ended. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano IV,</i> 447 F.3d at 124. The various pleadings submitted on municipal law at summary judgment amply demonstrate the lack of clarity. Indeed, the district court had originally concluded that Puerto Rican law established that plaintiffs had no such rights, <i>see Acevedo-Feliciano III,</i> 275 F.Supp.2d. at 166-67, and then reversed that determination on remand, <i>see </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano V,</i> 524 F.Supp.2d at 152-54, relying in both instances on roughly the same provisions of Commonwealth and municipal law. Given the intricate maze of Commonwealth and municipal law regarding employment under Law 52, no reasonable official would have known, in 2001, that terminating plaintiffs' approximately one-year contracts because Law 52 funds had expired would violate plaintiffs' procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p>Because the individual defendants are entitled to immunity, we vacate the judgment against them and remand with instructions to dismiss all claims against the individual defendants with prejudice. This ruling does not, however, affect the Municipality's liability. <i>See Walden,</i> 596 F.3d at 55 n. 23.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Award of Punitive Damages</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The jury awarded punitive damages to each of the twenty-two plaintiffs in the sum of $15,000 each, which was allotted as $7,500 against each of the two individual defendants. It was error, indeed plain error, to submit this issue to the jury.</p>\n<p>Punitive damages in a § 1983 civil rights action can be granted at the jury's discretion only if \"the defendant's conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.\" <i>Smith v. Wade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110915\"><a href=\"/opinion/110915/smith-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110915\"><a href=\"/opinion/110915/smith-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span> (1983). This court has \"emphasized that the `evil motive,' `intent,' or `reckless or callous indifference' pertains to the `<i>defendant's knowledge that [he] may be acting in violation of federal law.</i>'\" <i>Davignon v. Hodgson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203296\"><a href=\"/opinion/203296/davignon-v-hodgson/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.2008) (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Iacobucci v. Boulter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198661\"><a href=\"/opinion/198661/iacobucci-v-town-of-pembroke/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p>Puerto Rican law was unclear as to whether plaintiffs had a right to continued employment and so whether any constitutionally protected interest was involved at all. Given the complexity of the Commonwealth and municipal law at issue, it cannot logically be true that the individual defendants knew they may have been acting in violation of federal law. We vacate the punitive damages award and order dismissal of the punitive damages claim with prejudice on remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>Award of Damages against the Municipality</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As to each of the twenty-two plaintiffs, the jury awarded $15,000 in compensatory (\"suffering and anguish\") damages and $4,960 for back pay jointly and severally against defendants. We need not determine whether this is the appropriate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*269</span> measure of damages for a procedural due process violation; it is enough that the Municipality has never challenged it.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Municipality's only challenge to the back pay award is a specific argument that the award improperly included for each plaintiff a $500 Christmas bonus for 2001. There was no error in the district court's denial of remittitur on these grounds. Plaintiffs had a property interest in their employment through June 30, 2001, and under Puerto Rican law, any employee who works for the government for at least six months of a calendar year is entitled to an annual Christmas bonus. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 757. There was sufficient evidence to support the award of the bonus.</p>\n<p>We have considered the rest of the arguments made by each side and either have no need to reach them or have concluded they are without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We <i>vacate</i> the judgments against the individual defendants including the punitive damages award against them. We <i>remand</i> with instructions to dismiss all claims against the individual defendants with prejudice. Otherwise, the judgment against the Municipality is <i>affirmed.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Contrary to defendants' assertions, because the procedural due process question was appropriately resolved on undisputed facts on summary judgment, there is no Seventh Amendment issue. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Darr v. Town of Telluride,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169583\"><a href=\"/opinion/169583/darr-v-town-of-telluride-colo/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span>, 1252 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p>[2]  Nor is this a case in which plaintiffs sought to vindicate a right that had elapsed before suit was filed. Rather, plaintiffs were \"denied a right by virtue of which [they were] presently entitled . . . to pursue a gainful occupation,\" and that right cannot \"be fully protected by an ordinary breach-of-contract suit.\" <i>Lujan v.

Ruiz-Hernández (Acevedo-Feliciano I),</i> No. 01-1445 (D.P.R. Aug. 16, 2002) (order denying defendants' motion for summary judgment). On an interlocutory appeal, we affirmed the untimeliness ruling on February 3, 2003. We added that \"the qualified immunity defense, if properly asserted in the defendants' pleadings and otherwise properly maintained and presented, will still be available at trial; the only consequence of the district court's refusal to entertain the summary judgment motion on the qualified immunity question has been to preclude a pretrial resolution of the issue.\" <i>See Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández (Acevedo-Feliciano II),</i> No. 02-2287 (1st Cir. Feb. 3, 2003) (unpublished judgment).\n</p>\n<p>Defendants took all steps necessary to preserve this claim. They again raised it in their April 4, 2003, motion for judgment as a matter of law before the first jury trial, <i>see </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández (Acevedo-Feliciano III),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2463445\"><a href=\"/opinion/2463445/acevedo-feliciano-v-ruiz-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 164, 167-68 (D.P.R.2003) (denying defendants qualified immunity on the First Amendment claim but avoiding the question on the due process claim by holding that plaintiffs had no procedural due process right in continued employment). They also raised it after remand in their motion for summary judgment on the procedural due process claim, in their motion for judgment as a matter of law, and in their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p>[4]  To the extent that plaintiffs claim otherwise, nothing in our prior decision precluded the individual defendants from continuing to assert, on remand, that they were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n\n</div>",
