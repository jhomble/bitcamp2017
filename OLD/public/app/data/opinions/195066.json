In November 1990, the United\n                             \n\nStates Postal  Service decided  to buy a  36 acre  parcel of\n\nland,  located in  Waltham,  Massachusetts,  just  south  of\n\nLexington, near the intersection of two busy highways, Route\n\n128 and Route 2.   The Service intends to convert  the three\n\nbuildings now  on the  property into  a 400,000 square  foot\n\nmail distribution  facility.   Both  Waltham  and  Lexington\n\noppose the project.\n\n          In  May 1991, Waltham filed this lawsuit (in which\n\nLexington later intervened).  The towns pointed out that the\n\nService must  prepare an Environmental Impact  Statement (an\n\n\"EIS\") -- a  detailed statement on the  environmental impact\n\nof the proposed  project -- unless a  preliminary assessment\n\nallows the  Service to find  that the project will  have \"no\n\nsignificant   impact\"   on   the   environment.     National\n\nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\")   102, 42 U.S.C.  \n\n4332(C);  40  C.F.R.       1501.4,  1508.13;  39   C.F.R.   \n\n775.6(a)(2).  The  towns claimed that the  Service's finding\n\nof \"no significant impact\" was  faulty.  And, they asked the\n\ndistrict court to enjoin the Service from proceeding further\n\nuntil it prepared  an EIS (and  complied with several  other\n\nstatutes and regulations).\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          On  cross   motions  for  summary   judgment,  the\n\ndistrict  court denied the  injunction.  The  court reviewed\n\nthe  Service's  several   \"assessments\"  of  the   project's\n\npotential environmental impacts, and it concluded that those\n\nassessments,  taken  together,   provided  adequate  factual\n\nsupport   for   the   Service's   \"no  significant   impact\"\n\nconclusion.  It rejected the towns' other claims.\n\n          The  towns   now  appeal   the  district   court's\n\ndecision.  Waltham,  in particular,  in its  brief, makes  a\n\nvast number  of claims  and arguments, many  of them  highly\n\nfactual and record-based in nature.   We have dealt with the\n\nclaims and  arguments as follows.  First,  we have evaluated\n\nwhat seem to  us the most important factual  claims -- those\n\nmost  likely to  suggest  the  existence  of  a  significant\n\nenvironmental  effect -- in light  of a rather thorough, and\n\nindependent, reading of the 3800 page record (which includes\n\nabout 1800 pages of  \"environmental assessments\").   Second,\n\nwe  have  considered in  depth  what  seem  to us  the  most\n\nimportant  non-fact-related  legal  claims,  particularly  a\n\nquestion that the  towns raise about the  composition of the\n\nrecord.   Third, in evaluating the towns'  many other claims\n\n(less significant claims that, once  we had read the record,\n\nseemed unlikely to  have legal merit), we did  not go beyond\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nthe  record citations  and the  arguments  contained on  the\n\npages in the briefs where the towns raise those claims.\n\n          We mention  our approach  to the  case because  we\n\nwish counsel to  understand how a fairly  lengthy process of\n\nreview led to  a fairly simple ultimate  conclusion, namely,\n\nthat  the  district  court was  correct,  and  basically for\n\nreasons set forth  in its ninety-five page opinion.   We see\n\nno  need to  rewrite that  same opinion.   Rather,  we shall\n\nfirst  explain  why  we reject  the  towns'  main procedural\n\nargument (dealing with  the composition of the record).   We\n\nshall  then  discuss  the main  fact-related  claims.   But,\n\nsubsequently, we shall  indicate only briefly why  we reject\n\nthe  other arguments  that  the towns  have  made.   Counsel\n\nshould   take  our  statement   of  reasons   throughout  as\n\nsupplemented  by  those of  the  district court  and  by our\n\nconclusion  that, in  respect to  each  of the  fact-related\n\nclaims, the towns have not pointed to sufficient evidentiary\n\nsupport to create a triable issue.\n\n                             I\n\n                  The Scope of the Record\n                                         \n\n          The  Service's   consultants,  Rizzo   Associates,\n\ncompleted   three   studies    of   the   project's   likely\n\nenvironmental  effects.   The  Service  published the  first\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n\"environmental  assessment\" in  May 1990.    After a  public\n\nhearing, it  commissioned a  second  \"assessment,\" which  it\n\npublished in September.  Two months later, at the  beginning\n\nof  November,  the   Service  issued  its  \"finding   of  no\n\nsignificant impact\" (which it  conditioned on the assumption\n\nthat \"all  proposed mitigation  measures are  implemented\").\n\nShortly thereafter,  the Service  asked Rizzo  to perform  a\n\nthird study of the site.\n\n          The  third   assessment  analyzed   the  potential\n\nenvironmental  impact  of  proposed changes,  including  new\n\nmitigation measures, that the Service  intended to make.  It\n\nalso investigated more thoroughly  some of the environmental\n\nconcerns  that  the  towns had  expressed.    The assessment\n\nconcludes  that its findings  \"support[] the [finding  of no\n\nsignificant  impact]  issued  by  the  Postal  Service\"   in\n\nNovember.   The Service  published this third  assessment in\n\nJune 1991 (a month after Waltham brought this lawsuit) as an\n\n\"amendment\" to its earlier assessments.\n\n          The  towns'  most  important  argument  on  appeal\n\nconcerns this third study.   The towns believe that, without\n\nthe  third study,  the district court  would have  reached a\n\ndifferent    conclusion   about    the   project's    likely\n\nenvironmental impact.   And,  they argue  that the  district\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\ncourt should  not have  taken the third  study into  account\n\nbecause Rizzo  developed it after  the Service made  its \"no\n                                 \n\nsignificant  impact\" finding.    Cf.  Citizens  to  Preserve\n                                                            \n\nOverton  Park,  Inc. v.  Volpe,  401  U.S. 402,  419  (1971)\n                              \n\n(warning   against   accepting   an   agency's   \"post   hoc\n\nrationalizations\").   Cast  in its  best  light, the  towns'\n\nargument  amounts  to  both a  logical  claim,  namely, that\n\ninformation  developed   after   the   November   1990   \"no\n\nsignificant  impact\"  finding  cannot  help  show  that  the\n\nService's  finding was  lawful  earlier  when  made,  and  a\n                                       \n\npractical  claim, namely, that  the court, at  least, should\n\nremand  the case to  the Service so that  it, not the court,\n\ncan reassess its November 1990  decision in light of the new\n\ninformation.\n\n          We  agree with the  towns about the  importance of\n\nthe  third study.   Without  that  study, one  might find  a\n\n\"substantial   possibility\"   that    the   project   \"could\n\nsignificantly affect the quality  of the human environment\";\n\nand,  such a  finding  would  show the  need  to perform  an\n\nenvironmental impact  statement.    Quinonez-Lopez  v.  Coco\n                                                            \n\nLagoon Dev. Corp., 733 F.2d 1, 2  (1st Cir. 1984).  Once one\n                 \n\nconsiders  the third  assessment, however,  the \"substantial\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\npossibility,\" and the consequent need for an EIS, disappear.\n\nSee supra p. 6; infra part II.\n                     \n\n          We nonetheless disagree with the towns about court\n\nconsideration of  the third assessment.   We are  unaware of\n\nany   hard  and  fast   legal  rule  forbidding   a  court's\n\nconsideration of a subsequently made  assessment and project\n\nmodifications.   The  district court  independently reviewed\n\nthe third  assessment (as  have we).   We conclude  that, in\n\ndoing  so,  the  court  acted  lawfully,  in  light  of  the\n\nfollowing considerations.\n\n          First,  the towns seek more than a simple judicial\n\ndeclaration that the November 1990 decision was inadequately\n\nsupported when made.  (In fact, the district court basically\n\nconceded that it was not.)   Rather, they seek an injunction\n                                                            \n\nrequiring,   among   other   things,   preparation   of   an\n\nEnvironmental Impact  Statement.   The  third assessment  is\n\nhighly relevant  to the ultimate legal question in the case,\n\nnamely,  the  equitable  question  of  whether  or  not  the\n\ndistrict  court should  issue that  injunction.   It  offers\n\nstrong evidence that  the project will have  no significant,\n\nadverse environmental effects.   See supra  pp. 6, 7;  infra\n                                                            \n\nPart II  pp. 12-18.   It thereby  indicates that  the relief\n\nsought  is unnecessary, that  an injunction would  not serve\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nthe   public  interest,  and  that  one  could  not  justify\n\ninjunction-related  project  delays   through  reference  to\n\neventual statutorily-related environmental benefits.\n\n          Second, the  record indicates  that remand  of the\n\ncase  to the Service for further  consideration of the third\n\nassessment  would serve no  useful purpose.   The assessment\n\nreveals  no new  environmental harms,  nor  does it  provide\n\nevidence that  any already  considered harm  is more  likely\n\nthan previously thought.  Compare Massachusetts v. Watt, 716\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  946  (1st  Cir.  1983)  (requiring  development  of  a\n\nsupplementary EIS  where new evidence  significantly changes\n\nprevious factual assumptions).   Furthermore, the towns have\n\nnot cast  any significant  doubt on  the reliability  of the\n\nthird assessment's facts or its analysis.  Finally, there is\n\nno   reason   to   believe   that   the   Service's  further\n\nconsideration   of    this   third,    Service-commissioned,\n\nassessment would change the mind of a Service that found \"no\n\nsignificant  impact\" upon the bases of two, less convincing,\n\nanalyses.  Cf.  NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394  U.S. 759, 766\n                                        \n\nn.6  (1969) (\"[W]e  [need not]  convert  judicial review  of\n\nagency action into a ping-pong game.\").\n\n          Third,  the district  court  considered the  third\n\nassessment  independently (as  have we), without  giving the\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nbenefit of  any particular doubt  to the agency in  light of\n\nany presumed agency  expertise, or special  legal authority,\n\nto resolve  such matters.   In this way, it  guarded against\n\nwhat    courts    have    sometimes   called    \"post    hoc\n\nrationalization,\" namely,  an effort by agency  staff, after\n\nan agency has  made a decision,  to find supporting  reasons\n\nand  data that the  agency itself,  before the  event, might\n\nhave  considered irrelevant  or  unpersuasive.   See Overton\n                                                            \n\nPark,   401  U.S.   at  419.     The   risk  of   \"post  hoc\n    \n\nrationalization\" is particularly small in this case, for the\n\ndocument contains the same kind of analysis that the Service\n\nearlier  found persuasive.   It differs  from the  first two\n\nassessments  only  in  that  it  is  more  thorough  and  it\n\nconsiders in detail mitigation measures of the sort that the\n\nService had earlier \"assume[d]\" would be \"implemented.\"\n\n          The upshot is that the third assessment is unlike,\n\nsay, late  developed  evidence  of  significant,  previously\n\nunconsidered environmental harm -- evidence that may require\n\nfurther  agency  consideration,   particularly  in  a  legal\n\ncontext  that   offers  the   environment  only   procedural\n\nprotection.     See  Watt,   716  F.2d  at   952  (requiring\n                         \n\npreparation  of a  supplementary EIS).    Rather, the  third\n\nassessment  arises in  a  legal  context  in  which  further\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nenvironmental   investigation   and   additional  mitigation\n\nmeasures may  help an agency  produce a project  that better\n\nmeets  a  substantively  protective  environmental  standard\n\n(i.e.,  \"no  significant  impact\").   The  third  assessment\n\nprovides  evidence of  increased  mitigation and  diminished\n\nenvironmental  harm.    The  third  assessment  is  directly\n\nrelevant to the basic question of court-mandated relief.  By\n\nitself  (and in context) the third assessment indicates that\n\nneither an injunction nor remand to the agency is warranted.\n\nAnd  (as  independently   reviewed),  the  assessment  comes\n\nunaccompanied  with \"post  hoc rationalization\"  risks.   In\n\nthis context, we can find no convincing legal reason why the\n\ndistrict  court should  not (independently)  have considered\n\nthe  third assessment in reaching its  decision not to grant\n\nthe towns the relief they requested.\n\n                             II\n\n                         The Merits\n                                   \n\n          The  basic  legal  question,  on  the  merits,  is\n\nwhether  or not the  Postal Service could  lawfully conclude\n\nthat  its  project  will  not  \"significantly  affect[]  the\n\nquality of the human environment.\"  NEPA   102, 42 U.S.C.   \n\n4332(2)(C)(i).   The district court,  applying standards  at\n\nleast as  stringent as those  our cases have  proposed, see,\n                                                           \n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\ne.g., Sierra Club  v. Marsh, 769 F.2d 868,  870-71 (1st Cir.\n                           \n\n1985), found  the Service's  determination lawful.   We  too\n\nhave reviewed the  record.  We have taken  what we described\n\nin Marsh  as the  \"practical approach\"  to review,  avoiding\n        \n\nverbal formulas, but giving the record the type  of scrutiny\n\nfor which  the circumstances  call.  In  this case,  for the\n\nreasons  discussed in Part  I, that scrutiny,  in respect to\n\nthe third assessment, has been  strict.  We have reached the\n\nsame  conclusion as  the district  court,  namely, that  the\n\nrecord  does not show  a \"substantial possibility\"  that the\n\nproject \"could significantly affect the quality of the human\n\nenvironment.\"  Quinonez-Lopez, 733 F.2d at 2.\n                             \n\n          Our conclusions about the record,  and our reasons\n\nfor  affirming the district  court's decision, are basically\n\nthose the district court itself described in its ninety-five\n\npage opinion, supplemented as follows:\n\n          1.   Lexington, located just north of the project,\n\nsays  that the  project  might  injure  its  environment  by\n\ngenerating  additional truck  traffic,  at  least if  postal\n\ntrucks tend  to enter or  leave the project from  the north.\n\nThe basic problem  with this argument lies in  a record that\n\nindicates significant numbers of postal trucks will not tend\n\nto enter or leave the  project from the north.  The  project\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nis  just east of  Route 128.   Trucks may  easily drive from\n\nthat expressway  to the  project by  way  of a  road to  the\n\nsouth, and they may then  turn left and left again, entering\n\nthe  project  by  means  of its  southern  driveway.    (See\n\nAppendix for diagrams.)   Physical barriers in the road will\n\nprevent  trucks from turning left  (north) as they leave the\n\nproject along this  southern driveway or from  turning right\n\ninto this  driveway, should they try to approach the project\n\nfrom the north.\n\n          Lexington points out that there is also a northern\n\ndriveway,  and it  asks, what  is  to prevent  a truck  from\n\napproaching  the project  from the  north  and entering  (or\n\nleaving) the project along this northern driveway?  Although\n\nthe first  two environmental assessments  contained diagrams\n\nthat showed that  the northern entry would do  the trucks no\n\ngood (for the northern driveway  would not give them  access\n\nto  the  truck  parking   area),  the  third   environmental\n\nassessment  contains  a  slightly   different  diagram  that\n\nsuggests  that a truck  might enter the  project through the\n\nnorthern driveway and drive to the truck parking area.\n\n          In  our  view,  however,  the  third  assessment's\n\nnorthern-driveway-truck-parking-area   connection   is   not\n\nsufficient to show a \"substantial possibility\" of an adverse\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nenvironmental impact in  Lexington.  The government,  in its\n\nbrief,  says that  the Service  \"has  designated a  physical\n\nbarrier that will  prevent trucks from entering  or leaving\"\n\nthe  project \"from  the North.\"   The  Service says,  in its\n\nsecond  environmental assessment,  that  it  will enforce  a\n\ntraffic pattern on Postal Service trucks and contract trucks\n\nso that they will not enter from, or leave, the facility via\n\nthe  North.   The  Postal  Service's  regulations  create  a\n\nbinding  obligation to  implement \"[p]racticable  mitigation\n\nmeasures  identified in  an environmental  assessment.\"   39\n\nC.F.R.    775.6(a)(7).    And, the  district  court, in  its\n\nopinion \"expressly  rule[d] that the judgment entered  . . .\n\nis dependent  upon the  . ..  implementation  of the  . .  .\n\ntraffic design  plan .  . .  .\"   We interpret  the district\n\ncourt's  words \"traffic design plan\"  to include a plan that\n\neffectively assures that trucks will not enter  or leave the\n\nfacility by means of the  northern driveway.  That being so,\n\nwe can find no  substantial possibility of an  adverse truck\n\ntraffic impact in Lexington.\n\n          2.    Lexington  also  argues that  the  Service's\n\nplanned improvement of a roadway intersection near Lexington\n\nwill  mean more  traffic  traveling  through  the  town,  as\n\ndrivers  will choose  the improved  route  over other,  more\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\ncongested,  routes.   Lexington,  however, has  produced  no\n\nfactual  data that suggests  this possibility is  other than\n\nspeculative.   Nor can  Lexington plausibly  argue that  the\n\nService  should  have  investigated further  and  found  the\n\nrelevant data, for Lexington initially implied that it liked\n                                                            \n\nthe idea of an intersection improvement, not that it opposed\n\nthe idea.   Lexington  wrote the Service  that it  wanted to\n\n\"understand  the anticipated  benefits  of the  intersection\n                                      \n\nupgrade,\" and it asked the  Service for an analysis of \"what\n\nthe   impact  on  Lexington's  streets  would  be  if  [the]\n\nintersection upgrade does not occur.\"  (App. Vol. 2, p. 646,\n                             \n\nemphasis added).   We  have found nothing  in the  record to\n\nsuggest  that  anyone thought  the intersection  might cause\n\nadded-car-traffic  harm  of  the  sort  that  Lexington  now\n\nmentions.   And, Lexington does  not have the right  to make\n\nnew  arguments  about  this  problem at  this  stage  of the\n\nproceeding.    Valley  Citizens for  a  Safe  Environment v.\n                                                         \n\nAldridge,  969 F.2d 1315,  1317 (1st Cir.  1992); Teamsters,\n                                                            \n\nChauffeurs,  Warehousemen &amp; Helpers  Union, Local No.  59 v.\n                                                         \n\nSuperline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                     \n\n          3.     Waltham  argues   that  the   project  will\n\nsignificantly  and   adversely  affect  a   nearby  wetland,\n\nbasically by reducing the amount of rainwater that would run\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\noff the site into the wetland.  Its expert points to certain\n\nPostal  Service figures that, the expert says, indicate that\n\nthe project would reduce, by about 25% to 30%, the amount of\n\nwater that, during  a rainstorm, now runs  off the buildings\n\nand onto the  wetlands.  The third  environmental assessment\n\nindicates, however, that  rainwater runoff will not  decline\n\nsignificantly.\n\n          The third  assessment, in responding  primarily to\n\nWaltham's earlier claim that the project would discharge too\n                                                            \n\nmuch,   not  too   little,  rainwater   onto   the  wetlands\n    \n\n(threatening them with additional  pollutants), sets forth a\n\ndetailed  stormwater  management  plan, and,  in  doing  so,\n\ndiscusses  the amount  of  rainwater  that  will  leave  the\n\nproject.  It describes water detention basins that keep, but\n\nthen discharge,  water by  means of what  it calls  a \"flow-\n\ndispersing  swale,\" which  discharge  will \"replicat[e]  the\n\nsheet  flow occurring  in a  predeveloped  condition.\"   The\n\nplan,   it   says,   includes    methods   for   encouraging\n\n\"[g]roundwater  recharge.\"   The description  indicates that\n\nthe project will not affect  drainage from the existing roof\n\narea.  It adds that water running off the new roof area will\n\nbe directed partly to a similar \"flow-dispersing swale,\" and\n\npartly   to  a   \"subsurface  recharge  system\"   that  will\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\n\"replenish the  groundwater, avoiding  indirect hydrological\n\nimpacts  on the  nearby wetlands  and stream.\"   Given  this\n\ndiscussion  of   the  storm  water  management  plan,  taken\n\ntogether  with the fact  that the district  court explicitly\n\nconditioned  its judgment \"upon . .  . implementation of the\n\namended  stormwater management  . .  .  plan,\" Waltham,  its\n\nexpert  notwithstanding, has failed  to show any substantial\n\nlikelihood that an environmentally significant lessening  of\n\nrainwater runoff will occur.\n\n          4.  Waltham  says that the Service will  build the\n\nproject in a  wetland area, without complying  with \"wetland\n\nconstruction\"  legal  requirements.    The  district  court,\n\nhowever, found to  the contrary.  The record  shows that the\n\nService collected  relevant information about  the wetlands.\n\nSee 39 C.F.R.   776.5(a).  Furthermore, the third assessment\n   \n\nsays that the project will not involve wetland construction.\n\nThe site  plans, as far  as we understand them,  confirm the\n\nassessment's  statement.  And, Waltham points to no specific\n\nevidence that might  refute the statement.   Regardless, the\n\ndistrict court explicitly made its  judgment \"dependent upon\n\n.  .  .  the  avoidance  of  construction  in  floodplain or\n\nwetlands or the discharge of fill into wetlands.\"\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\n          5.    Waltham  says  that  the  Service's proposed\n\naddition  to the  existing buildings,  as  described in  the\n\nthird  assessment,  is  twice  the  size  of  that  addition\n\ndescribed in  the earlier  assessments, which  fact (Waltham\n\nadds) \"raises a number of issues which must be addressed\" by\n\nthe Service.   One  problem with this  argument lies  in our\n\ninability to  understand  (despite our  examination  of  the\n\nvarious relevant diagrams) how Waltham reached its \"enlarged\n\nbuilding\"  conclusions.     Regardless,  Waltham  does   not\n\nspecifically  or convincingly  explain why  any diagrammatic\n\ninconsistency between  the  earlier  and  later  assessments\n\nwould make  a relevant legal  difference.  A change  in size\n\ndoes   not  automatically   mean   greater,  or   different,\n\nenvironmental  effects than the record describes.  The third\n\nassessment's environmental analysis, after all, concerns the\n\n(allegedly bigger) building  project described in  the third\n\nassessment.  Thus,  the analysis of groundwater  runoff, for\n\nexample, that we  find adequate (for reasons set  out at pp.\n\n15-16, supra)  also seems  adequate in  respect to  whatever\n            \n\n\"enlarged\"  building that  the  third assessment  describes.\n\nWaltham's brief,  in the  portion devoted  to its  \"enlarged\n\nbuilding\" claim, refers generally to  toxic waste and to the\n\ngeneral  appearance of  the  building.    But,  it  provides\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nneither record  citations nor specific  arguments that could\n\nlead us  to conclude  that whatever  changes it  has deduced\n\nfrom the diagrams  make a relevant  difference in these,  or\n\nother, relevant environmental respects.  We therefore cannot\n\naccept its \"enlarged building\" argument.\n\n          6.    Waltham  mentions  the project's  impact  on\n\nnoise.   The district  court, however, pointed  out that the\n\nthird assessment thoroughly analyzed the noise problem.  The\n\ncourt  concluded that,  even without the  various mitigation\n\nmeasures proposed (measures  that postal regulations require\n\nthe  Service to  implement, 39  C.F.R.    775.6(a)(7)),  the\n\nenvironment will suffer no significant impact on noise.  The\n\nstudies support that conclusion.   And, Waltham points to no\n\nsignificantly conflicting evidence.\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\n                            III\n\n                     Procedural Claims\n                                      \n\n          Waltham objects to several of the district court's\n\nprocedural rulings.   We shall  briefly explain why  we find\n\nthese objections without legal merit.\n\n          1.  The district court's decision not to grant the\n                                               \n\ninjunction was embodied in its grant of the Service's motion\n                                    \n\nfor  summary   judgment  and  its   accompanying  denial  of\n                                                        \n\nWaltham's  converse summary  judgment motion.   Waltham says\n\nthat the district  court's own summary judgment  rule, Local\n\nRule 56.1, required  the court to grant  the Waltham motion.\n\nIt points to three parts of the rule:\n\n          a.   The rule says that a party moving for summary\n               judgment must attach \"a  concise statement of\n               material facts  of  record as  to  which  the\n               moving  party contends  there  is no  genuine\n               issue to be tried.\"\n\n          b.   The  rule adds  that the opposing  party must\n               then include \"a concise statement of material\n               facts of record  as to which it  is contended\n               that  there  exists  a  genuine  issue to  be\n               tried.\"\n\n          c.   The rule concludes that  any fact \"set forth\"\n               in  the  moving   party's  statement,  unless\n               \"controverted\"   in   the   opposing  party's\n                            \n               statement,  \"will be  deemed for  purposes of\n               the  motion  to   be  admitted  by   opposing\n                                             \n               parties.\"\n\nLocal Rule, D. Mass. 56.1 (emphases  added).  Waltham points\n\nout that it attached a long statement of facts to its motion\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nfor summary judgment, but the  Service did not attach a list\n                                              \n\nof facts to its opposition.   Hence, says Waltham, the court\n\nshould have  considered its list of facts  \"to be admitted,\"\n\nand  those  facts,  it  believes,  entitled  it  to  summary\n\njudgment (and the injunction).\n\n          The problem with this argument is that the Service\n\ndid  submit a  \"concise statement  of  material facts\"  that\n   \n\n(despite Waltham's own opposing statements, and for  reasons\n\nset out here and in the district court's opinion) adequately\n\nsupported  judgment in  its  favor  --  though  the  Service\n\nphysically  attached that statement  only to its  own motion\n                                                     \n\nfor summary judgment without also physically attaching it to\n                                 \n\nits opposition to Waltham's motion.  The district court held\n\nthat the Service's failure also to attach a duplicate of the\n\ndocument  to its opposition  made no legal  difference (even\n\nthough the Service did not literally comply  with the rule).\n\nAnd, that holding makes perfect sense to us.  After all, the\n\nService's error (failing  to make  an additional  copy of  a\n\ndocument already  in the  record) was  highly technical  and\n\nnonprejudicial.  Waltham, and the court, were fully aware of\n\nthe  Service's view  about the  facts.   Were one  to accept\n\nWaltham's literal interpretation of the local rule, it could\n\nrequire the district court, nonsensically, to grant both the\n                                                        \n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n\nService's  motion (which  all factual  statements adequately\n\nsupport) and  Waltham's conflicting  motion.   The  district\n            \n\ncourt has  authority to  interpret  its own  local rules  in\n\nnontechnical ways and to avoid  such results.  United States\n                                                            \n\nv. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 46 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                           \n\n493  U.S. 862  (1989).    The  district  court's  nonliteral\n\nreading  of the summary judgment rule, creating an exception\n\nfor the present  circumstances, falls well within  the scope\n\nof that legal authority.\n\n          2.   Waltham argues that the district court should\n\nhave  granted its discovery request for \"two filing cabinets\n\nfull\"  of  material  that the  Service  compiled  during the\n\ncourse  of  its  environmental  investigations.   The  court\n\ndenied  the  request  because  it  accepted   the  Service's\n\nstatement that it  had not relied upon any  of this material\n\nin reaching any of the here-relevant conclusions.  The court\n\nhas broad power to  control discovery.  Santiago v.  Fenton,\n                                                           \n\n891 F.2d 373,  379 (1st  Cir. 1989).   In doing  so, it  can\n\nweigh discovery  burdens against  the likelihood  of finding\n\nrelevant material.   Mack v. Great Atlantic  and Pacific Tea\n                                                            \n\nCo., 871 F.2d 179, 186-87 (1st Cir. 1989).  We will overturn\n   \n\na  discovery decision  of this  sort  only when  we find  it\n\nplainly  wrong and substantially prejudicial.  Santiago, 891\n                                                       \n\n                            -22-\n                             22\n\nF.2d at  379;  Mack, 871  F.2d  at  186.   Waltham  has  not\n                   \n\nprovided us with any basis  for finding a violation of these\n\nlegal standards.\n\n          3.   Waltham  argues that  the  court should  have\n\nordered the Service to provide it with a document called the\n\n\"Berger assessment\" -- a document  that apparently discusses\n\nthe  environmental effects of  choosing other sites  for the\n\nnew  facility.    Waltham,  however,  has  not  convincingly\n\nexplained why the document  is relevant to the  legal issues\n\nbefore us  in this case.  And, it  provides us with no basis\n\nfor  finding that  the district  court violated  any of  the\n\nlegal standards described in the preceding paragraph.\n\n          4.  Waltham asked the  district court not to admit\n\nin  evidence a  letter  from the  Service  proposing to  pay\n\nWaltham $1.6 million for roadway improvements.  The district\n\ncourt did  not rule on  Waltham's claim that the  letter was\n\nnot properly authenticated.  The letter, in our view, has no\n\nsignificance.  Other documents,  properly admitted, say that\n\nthe  Service was  willing to  pay  Waltham $1.5  million for\n\nroadway improvements.   And, we do not see  how the $100,000\n\ndifference  (between  the  $1.6  million  and  $1.5  million\n\noffers) could  make any  difference to  the outcome  of this\n\ncase.   We have  not considered the  $1.6 million  letter in\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\nreaching  our decision.   Insofar as the  district court may\n\nhave done so (say, in  respect to traffic impact), any error\n\nis harmless.   United  States v. Pisari,  636 F.2d  855, 859\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1981).\n\n          5.  Waltham has made various claims to  the effect\n\nthat the Postal  Service has acted in \"bad faith.\"   We have\n\nnot found in the record, however, specific  evidence of \"bad\n\nfaith\"  sufficient to  invalidate  the Service's  finding in\n\nrespect to the  lack of adverse  environmental impact or  to\n\ndemonstrate  a  violation  of any  other  relevant  law that\n\nWaltham has mentioned.\n\n                             IV\n\n                   Adequate Consultation\n                                        \n\n          1.   The law requires  the Service to consult with\n\nlocal  authorities about its project.  The Intergovernmental\n\nCooperation Act (\"ICA\"), for example, says that\n\n          [t]o  the extent  possible,  all  . .  .\n          local viewpoints  shall be considered in\n          planning   development    programs   and\n          projects . . . . \n\nICA   401(c), 31 U.S.C.   6506(c).\n\n          An Executive Order,  elaborating this requirement,\nsays\n\n          [f]ederal    agencies   shall    provide\n          opportunities   for    consultation   by\n\n                            -24-\n                             24\n\n          elected  officials  of those  State  and\n          local governments  . .  . that  would be\n          directly  affected  by  .  .  .   direct\n          Federal development . . . .\n\nMoreover, \n\n          [f]or  those  cases where  the  concerns\n          cannot    be    accommodated,    Federal\n          officials  shall explain  the bases  for\n          their decision in a timely manner.\n\nExec. Order No. 12,372, 47 Fed. Reg. 30,959 (1982).\n\n          Waltham  claims that  the  Service violated  these\n\nlegal obligations.   It concedes that Service  employees met\n\nwith Waltham  officials many times.   It does not  deny, for\n\nexample, the  accuracy of an  affidavit that refers  to such\n\nmeetings  in October 1989, January, March, June (two), July,\n\nSeptember, October, November  and December  1990, and  March\n\nand May 1991.  But,  says Waltham, all pre-May 1990 meetings\n\nconcerned  other possible  project  sites, and  all post-May\n                \n\n1990   meetings  took  place  only  after  the  Service  had\n\ndeveloped a \"bureaucratic commitment\" to the present site --\n\nwhich  fact,  in  Waltham's view,  makes  the  post-May 1990\n\nmeetings irrelevant.\n\n          In  our  view,  neither  the  Act  nor  the  Order\n\nrequires  a federal agency to begin consultations before the\n\nagency makes any commitment to a particular project or takes\n                \n\nany steps towards  carrying out such a project.   Nothing in\n   \n\n                            -25-\n                             25\n\nthe  Act or Order  suggests an intent  to integrate federal,\n\nstate, and local  bureaucracies to the extent  that any such\n\ninterpretation would require.  Nor does the language of  the\n\nAct  or Order  suggest  an  intent to  give  state or  local\n\nofficials  the right to  veto federal projects,  where, say,\n\nspeed is important or practical considerations indicate that\n\na degree  of pre-consultation federal  bureaucratic activity\n\nis  desirable.    Rather,  the  relevant  statutory language\n\nsimply  requires  \"consider[ation]\"  of  \"local  viewpoints\"\n\nduring the  \"planning\"  stages  of  a  project.    In  these\n\nrespects it  is quite different  from the language  of, say,\n\nNEPA, a  statute that insists that \"a  detailed statement by\n\nthe  responsible official on the environmental impact of the\n\nproposed action\"  be  included in  \"every recommendation  or\n\nreport  on  proposals  for  .  .  .  major  Federal  actions\n\nsignificantly   affecting   the   quality   of   the   human\n\nenvironment,\" that  is, at  the time  when  the decision  to\n\nwhich  NEPA obligations  attach is  made.   NEPA    102,  42\n\nU.S.C.   4332(C)(i); see also Watt, 716 F.2d at 952.\n                                  \n\n          With these provisions  in mind,  we have  examined\n\nthe record.   We find the record indicates  that the Service\n\nprovided meaningful consultation, considered local points of\n\nview, and  made  reasonable  efforts  to  accommodate  local\n\n                            -26-\n                             26\n\nconcerns.  Publication of the first environmental assessment\n\nin   May  1990  did  not  preclude  subsequent,  meaningful,\n\nconsultation,   consideration,  and   accommodation.     The\n\ndevelopment of further assessments, the changes subsequently\n\nmade to mitigate potentially adverse environmental  effects,\n\nand  other  related  changes,  all  show  that  the  Service\n\nlistened   to   local   viewpoints   and   made   reasonable\n\naccommodation  efforts.     Waltham   strongly  states   the\n\ncontrary,  but  it   does  not  point  to   record  evidence\n\nsufficient to show either a lack of meaningful consultations\n\nor  a failure  to take  local points  of view  into account,\n\nwhether those  consultations and  accommodations took  place\n\nbefore, or only after, May 1990.\n\n          2.  Waltham says that the Service has violated the\n\nExecutive  Order (or  the  Act)  because  the  project  will\n\ndiminish local tax revenues by $560,000, and the Service did\n\nnot  adequately  address  these tax  consequences.    We are\n\nwilling to assume,  for argument's sake, that  the Executive\n\nOrder  imposes upon  the federal  government an  obligation,\n\nlegally  enforceable  in  present  circumstances,  to   make\n\n\"efforts  to accommodate\" local concerns and \"to explain the\n\nbases for their decision\" when they do not accommodate local\n\nconcerns.  But still, the Executive Order would not prohibit\n\n                            -27-\n                             27\n\nthe  federal government  from  removing local  property from\n\nstate  and local  tax rolls.   It  would simply  require the\n\ngovernment  to have  a sensible,  understandable  reason for\n\ndoing so.  In this  case, the adverse local tax consequences\n\nunderstandably flow from the federal government's need for a\n\nnew postal facility  and its decision to build that facility\n\nin Waltham.  More importantly, the Service  did consider the\n\ntax consequences of  its action.  The  initial environmental\n\nassessment  identifies the issue  and says that  the Service\n\nhad \"agreed to provide  infrastructure improvements in  lieu\n\nof taxes,\" as does the second assessment.  Waltham points to\n\nno  specific evidence  that might show,  in this  respect, a\n\nviolation of the Act or Order.\n\n          3. Waltham  makes  a similar  complaint about  the\n\nService's  consideration of zoning  issues.  Both  the first\n\nand  second  environmental   assessments,  however,  discuss\n\nzoning issues.  The  assessment notes that the new  facility\n\nwould technically be a nonconforming use,  but that it would\n\n\"not  significantly change  the existing  land  use from  an\n\naesthetics perspective\" and that the previous owner's use of\n\nthe  property was  similar to  the  Service's proposed  use.\n\nWaltham  has  not  pointed  to  any  specific zoning-related\n\nproblem that might show a violation of the Act or the Order.\n\n                            -28-\n                             28\n\n          4. Lexington points  to Postal Service regulations\n\nthat  require  the Service  to  notify  it of  any  proposed\n\nenvironmental  assessment  before  the  Service  makes  that\n\nassessment.   39 C.F.R.     775.7(b), 775.10(a).   Lexington\n\nadds that it did not  receive notice prior to publication of\n\nthe  first environmental assessment  in May 1990.   Assuming\n\n(as  did the district  court) for summary  judgment purposes\n\nthat this is  so, the notice failure  still does not  make a\n\nsignificant  legal difference.  That is because the Service,\n\nafter  May  1990,  provided   Lexington  with  an   adequate\n\nopportunity  to comment,  particularly  about the  potential\n\ntraffic problems that  concerned the town.   And, subsequent\n\nto May 1990  the Service  prepared additional  environmental\n\nassessments   and  consulted   with   Lexington.     Because\n\nmeaningful consultation subsequently took  place, any notice\n\nviolation,  in the district  court's view, was  harmless and\n\ndid  not warrant  an  injunction.    The  record  adequately\n\nsupports  the conclusion that  any such violation  would not\n\nsignificantly affect the quality of the environment.\n\n                             V\n\n                    The Clean Water Act\n                                       \n\n          Waltham argues  that the Service  has violated the\n\nClean  Water Act,  33 U.S.C.     1342,  1344, by  failing to\n\n                            -29-\n                             29\n\nobtain  two necessary permits:  1) a permit  that allows the\n\ndischarge of  material onto  wetlands and  2) a  permit that\n\nallows the discharge  of pollutants.  We do  not believe the\n\nClean Water  Act requires  the Service  to obtain  the first\n\npermit because the  third assessment makes clear  that there\n\nwill not be  sufficient discharge of material  onto wetlands\n\nto  trigger the permit  requirement.  See  pp. 16-17, supra.\n                                                           \n\nThe Service concedes that it needs the second permit, and it\n\nis  in the  process of  obtaining  it.   The district  court\n\nspecified that  its \"judgment  . . .  is dependent  upon the\n\nissuance of [that] permit.\"  We therefore see no need for an\n\ninjunction.   Weinberger  v.

In November 1990, the United\n                             \n\nStates Postal  Service decided  to buy a  36 acre  parcel of\n\nland,  located in  Waltham,  Massachusetts,  just  south  of\n\nLexington, near the intersection of two busy highways, Route\n\n128 and Route 2.   The Service intends to convert  the three\n\nbuildings now  on the  property into  a 400,000 square  foot\n\nmail distribution  facility.   Both  Waltham  and  Lexington\n\noppose the project.\n\n          In  May 1991, Waltham filed this lawsuit (in which\n\nLexington later intervened).  The towns pointed out that the\n\nService must  prepare an Environmental Impact  Statement (an\n\n\"EIS\") -- a  detailed statement on the  environmental impact\n\nof the proposed  project -- unless a  preliminary assessment\n\nallows the  Service to find  that the project will  have \"no\n\nsignificant   impact\"   on   the   environment.     National\n\nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\")   102, 42 U.S.C.  \n\n4332(C);  40  C.F.R.       1501.4,  1508.13;  39   C.F.R.   \n\n775.6(a)(2).  The  towns claimed that the  Service's finding\n\nof \"no significant impact\" was  faulty.  And, they asked the\n\ndistrict court to enjoin the Service from proceeding further\n\nuntil it prepared  an EIS (and  complied with several  other\n\nstatutes and regulations).\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          On  cross   motions  for  summary   judgment,  the\n\ndistrict  court denied the  injunction.  The  court reviewed\n\nthe  Service's  several   \"assessments\"  of  the   project's\n\npotential environmental impacts, and it concluded that those\n\nassessments,  taken  together,   provided  adequate  factual\n\nsupport   for   the   Service's   \"no  significant   impact\"\n\nconclusion.  It rejected the towns' other claims.\n\n          The  towns   now  appeal   the  district   court's\n\ndecision.  Waltham,  in particular,  in its  brief, makes  a\n\nvast number  of claims  and arguments, many  of them  highly\n\nfactual and record-based in nature.   We have dealt with the\n\nclaims and  arguments as follows.  First,  we have evaluated\n\nwhat seem to  us the most important factual  claims -- those\n\nmost  likely to  suggest  the  existence  of  a  significant\n\nenvironmental  effect -- in light  of a rather thorough, and\n\nindependent, reading of the 3800 page record (which includes\n\nabout 1800 pages of  \"environmental assessments\").   Second,\n\nwe  have  considered in  depth  what  seem  to us  the  most\n\nimportant  non-fact-related  legal  claims,  particularly  a\n\nquestion that the  towns raise about the  composition of the\n\nrecord.   Third, in evaluating the towns'  many other claims\n\n(less significant claims that, once  we had read the record,\n\nseemed unlikely to  have legal merit), we did  not go beyond\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nthe  record citations  and the  arguments  contained on  the\n\npages in the briefs where the towns raise those claims.\n\n          We mention  our approach  to the  case because  we\n\nwish counsel to  understand how a fairly  lengthy process of\n\nreview led to  a fairly simple ultimate  conclusion, namely,\n\nthat  the  district  court was  correct,  and  basically for\n\nreasons set forth  in its ninety-five page opinion.   We see\n\nno  need to  rewrite that  same opinion.   Rather,  we shall\n\nfirst  explain  why  we reject  the  towns'  main procedural\n\nargument (dealing with  the composition of the record).   We\n\nshall  then  discuss  the main  fact-related  claims.   But,\n\nsubsequently, we shall  indicate only briefly why  we reject\n\nthe  other arguments  that  the towns  have  made.   Counsel\n\nshould   take  our  statement   of  reasons   throughout  as\n\nsupplemented  by  those of  the  district court  and  by our\n\nconclusion  that, in  respect to  each  of the  fact-related\n\nclaims, the towns have not pointed to sufficient evidentiary\n\nsupport to create a triable issue.\n\n                             I\n\n                  The Scope of the Record\n                                         \n\n          The  Service's   consultants,  Rizzo   Associates,\n\ncompleted   three   studies    of   the   project's   likely\n\nenvironmental  effects.   The  Service  published the  first\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n\"environmental  assessment\" in  May 1990.    After a  public\n\nhearing, it  commissioned a  second  \"assessment,\" which  it\n\npublished in September.  Two months later, at the  beginning\n\nof  November,  the   Service  issued  its  \"finding   of  no\n\nsignificant impact\" (which it  conditioned on the assumption\n\nthat \"all  proposed mitigation  measures are  implemented\").\n\nShortly thereafter,  the Service  asked Rizzo  to perform  a\n\nthird study of the site.\n\n          The  third   assessment  analyzed   the  potential\n\nenvironmental  impact  of  proposed changes,  including  new\n\nmitigation measures, that the Service  intended to make.  It\n\nalso investigated more thoroughly  some of the environmental\n\nconcerns  that  the  towns had  expressed.    The assessment\n\nconcludes  that its findings  \"support[] the [finding  of no\n\nsignificant  impact]  issued  by  the  Postal  Service\"   in\n\nNovember.   The Service  published this third  assessment in\n\nJune 1991 (a month after Waltham brought this lawsuit) as an\n\n\"amendment\" to its earlier assessments.\n\n          The  towns'  most  important  argument  on  appeal\n\nconcerns this third study.   The towns believe that, without\n\nthe  third study,  the district court  would have  reached a\n\ndifferent    conclusion   about    the   project's    likely\n\nenvironmental impact.   And,  they argue  that the  district\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\ncourt should  not have  taken the third  study into  account\n\nbecause Rizzo  developed it after  the Service made  its \"no\n                                 \n\nsignificant  impact\" finding.

Cast  in its  best  light, the  towns'\n\nargument  amounts  to  both a  logical  claim,  namely, that\n\ninformation  developed   after   the   November   1990   \"no\n\nsignificant  impact\"  finding  cannot  help  show  that  the\n\nService's  finding was  lawful  earlier  when  made,  and  a\n                                       \n\npractical  claim, namely, that  the court, at  least, should\n\nremand  the case to  the Service so that  it, not the court,\n\ncan reassess its November 1990  decision in light of the new\n\ninformation.\n\n          We  agree with the  towns about the  importance of\n\nthe  third study.   Without  that  study, one  might find  a\n\n\"substantial   possibility\"   that    the   project   \"could\n\nsignificantly affect the quality  of the human environment\";\n\nand,  such a  finding  would  show the  need  to perform  an\n\nenvironmental impact  statement.

Once one\n                 \n\nconsiders  the third  assessment, however,  the \"substantial\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\npossibility,\" and the consequent need for an EIS, disappear.\n\nSee supra p. 6; infra part II.\n                     \n\n          We nonetheless disagree with the towns about court\n\nconsideration of  the third assessment.   We are  unaware of\n\nany   hard  and  fast   legal  rule  forbidding   a  court's\n\nconsideration of a subsequently made  assessment and project\n\nmodifications.   The  district court  independently reviewed\n\nthe third  assessment (as  have we).   We conclude  that, in\n\ndoing  so,  the  court  acted  lawfully,  in  light  of  the\n\nfollowing considerations.\n\n          First,  the towns seek more than a simple judicial\n\ndeclaration that the November 1990 decision was inadequately\n\nsupported when made.  (In fact, the district court basically\n\nconceded that it was not.)   Rather, they seek an injunction\n                                                            \n\nrequiring,   among   other   things,   preparation   of   an\n\nEnvironmental Impact  Statement.   The  third assessment  is\n\nhighly relevant  to the ultimate legal question in the case,\n\nnamely,  the  equitable  question  of  whether  or  not  the\n\ndistrict  court should  issue that  injunction.   It  offers\n\nstrong evidence that  the project will have  no significant,\n\nadverse environmental effects.   See supra  pp. 6, 7;  infra\n                                                            \n\nPart II  pp. 12-18.   It thereby  indicates that  the relief\n\nsought  is unnecessary, that  an injunction would  not serve\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nthe   public  interest,  and  that  one  could  not  justify\n\ninjunction-related  project  delays   through  reference  to\n\neventual statutorily-related environmental benefits.\n\n          Second, the  record indicates  that remand  of the\n\ncase  to the Service for further  consideration of the third\n\nassessment  would serve no  useful purpose.   The assessment\n\nreveals  no new  environmental harms,  nor  does it  provide\n\nevidence that  any already  considered harm  is more  likely\n\nthan previously thought.  Compare Massachusetts v. Watt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424681\"><a href=\"/opinion/424681/commonwealth-of-massachusetts-v-james-g-watt-commonwealth-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span>\n                                                       \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1st  Cir.  1983)  (requiring  development  of  a\n\nsupplementary EIS  where new evidence  significantly changes\n\nprevious factual assumptions).   Furthermore, the towns have\n\nnot cast  any significant  doubt on  the reliability  of the\n\nthird assessment's facts or its analysis.  Finally, there is\n\nno   reason   to   believe   that   the   Service's  further\n\nconsideration   of    this   third,    Service-commissioned,\n\nassessment would change the mind of a Service that found \"no\n\nsignificant  impact\" upon the bases of two, less convincing,\n\nanalyses.

Wyman-Gordon Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107915\"><a href=\"/opinion/107915/nlrb-v-wyman-gordon-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 766\n                                        \n\nn.6  (1969) (\"[W]e  [need not]  convert  judicial review  of\n\nagency action into a ping-pong game.\").\n\n          Third,  the district  court  considered the  third\n\nassessment  independently (as  have we), without  giving the\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nbenefit of  any particular doubt  to the agency in  light of\n\nany presumed agency  expertise, or special  legal authority,\n\nto resolve  such matters.   In this way, it  guarded against\n\nwhat    courts    have    sometimes   called    \"post    hoc\n\nrationalization,\" namely,  an effort by agency  staff, after\n\nan agency has  made a decision,  to find supporting  reasons\n\nand  data that the  agency itself,  before the  event, might\n\nhave  considered irrelevant  or  unpersuasive.   See Overton\n                                                            \n\nPark,   401  U.S.   at  419.     The   risk  of   \"post  hoc\n    \n\nrationalization\" is particularly small in this case, for the\n\ndocument contains the same kind of analysis that the Service\n\nearlier  found persuasive.   It differs  from the  first two\n\nassessments  only  in  that  it  is  more  thorough  and  it\n\nconsiders in detail mitigation measures of the sort that the\n\nService had earlier \"assume[d]\" would be \"implemented.\"\n\n          The upshot is that the third assessment is unlike,\n\nsay, late  developed  evidence  of  significant,  previously\n\nunconsidered environmental harm -- evidence that may require\n\nfurther  agency  consideration,   particularly  in  a  legal\n\ncontext  that   offers  the   environment  only   procedural\n\nprotection.     See  Watt,   716  F.2d  at   952  (requiring\n                         \n\npreparation  of a  supplementary EIS).    Rather, the  third\n\nassessment  arises in  a  legal  context  in  which  further\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nenvironmental   investigation   and   additional  mitigation\n\nmeasures may  help an agency  produce a project  that better\n\nmeets  a  substantively  protective  environmental  standard\n\n(i.e.,  \"no  significant  impact\").   The  third  assessment\n\nprovides  evidence of  increased  mitigation and  diminished\n\nenvironmental  harm.    The  third  assessment  is  directly\n\nrelevant to the basic question of court-mandated relief.  By\n\nitself  (and in context) the third assessment indicates that\n\nneither an injunction nor remand to the agency is warranted.\n\nAnd  (as  independently   reviewed),  the  assessment  comes\n\nunaccompanied  with \"post  hoc rationalization\"  risks.   In\n\nthis context, we can find no convincing legal reason why the\n\ndistrict  court should  not (independently)  have considered\n\nthe  third assessment in reaching its  decision not to grant\n\nthe towns the relief they requested.\n\n                             II\n\n                         The Merits\n                                   \n\n          The  basic  legal  question,  on  the  merits,  is\n\nwhether  or not the  Postal Service could  lawfully conclude\n\nthat  its  project  will  not  \"significantly  affect[]  the\n\nquality of the human environment.\"  NEPA   102, 42 U.S.C.   \n\n4332(2)(C)(i).

We  too\n\nhave reviewed the  record.  We have taken  what we described\n\nin Marsh  as the  \"practical approach\"  to review,  avoiding\n        \n\nverbal formulas, but giving the record the type  of scrutiny\n\nfor which  the circumstances  call.  In  this case,  for the\n\nreasons  discussed in Part  I, that scrutiny,  in respect to\n\nthe third assessment, has been  strict.  We have reached the\n\nsame  conclusion as  the district  court,  namely, that  the\n\nrecord  does not show  a \"substantial possibility\"  that the\n\nproject \"could significantly affect the quality of the human\n\nenvironment.\"  Quinonez-Lopez, 733 F.2d at 2.\n                             \n\n          Our conclusions about the record,  and our reasons\n\nfor  affirming the district  court's decision, are basically\n\nthose the district court itself described in its ninety-five\n\npage opinion, supplemented as follows:\n\n          1.   Lexington, located just north of the project,\n\nsays  that the  project  might  injure  its  environment  by\n\ngenerating  additional truck  traffic,  at  least if  postal\n\ntrucks tend  to enter or  leave the project from  the north.\n\nThe basic problem  with this argument lies in  a record that\n\nindicates significant numbers of postal trucks will not tend\n\nto enter or leave the  project from the north.  The  project\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nis  just east of  Route 128.   Trucks may  easily drive from\n\nthat expressway  to the  project by  way  of a  road to  the\n\nsouth, and they may then  turn left and left again, entering\n\nthe  project  by  means  of its  southern  driveway.    (See\n\nAppendix for diagrams.)   Physical barriers in the road will\n\nprevent  trucks from turning left  (north) as they leave the\n\nproject along this  southern driveway or from  turning right\n\ninto this  driveway, should they try to approach the project\n\nfrom the north.\n\n          Lexington points out that there is also a northern\n\ndriveway,  and it  asks, what  is  to prevent  a truck  from\n\napproaching  the project  from the  north  and entering  (or\n\nleaving) the project along this northern driveway?  Although\n\nthe first  two environmental assessments  contained diagrams\n\nthat showed that  the northern entry would do  the trucks no\n\ngood (for the northern driveway  would not give them  access\n\nto  the  truck  parking   area),  the  third   environmental\n\nassessment  contains  a  slightly   different  diagram  that\n\nsuggests  that a truck  might enter the  project through the\n\nnorthern driveway and drive to the truck parking area.\n\n          In  our  view,  however,  the  third  assessment's\n\nnorthern-driveway-truck-parking-area   connection   is   not\n\nsufficient to show a \"substantial possibility\" of an adverse\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nenvironmental impact in  Lexington.  The government,  in its\n\nbrief,  says that  the Service  \"has  designated a  physical\n\nbarrier that will  prevent trucks from entering  or leaving\"\n\nthe  project \"from  the North.\"   The  Service says,  in its\n\nsecond  environmental assessment,  that  it  will enforce  a\n\ntraffic pattern on Postal Service trucks and contract trucks\n\nso that they will not enter from, or leave, the facility via\n\nthe  North.   The  Postal  Service's  regulations  create  a\n\nbinding  obligation to  implement \"[p]racticable  mitigation\n\nmeasures  identified in  an environmental  assessment.\"   39\n\nC.F.R.    775.6(a)(7).    And, the  district  court, in  its\n\nopinion \"expressly  rule[d] that the judgment entered  . . .\n\nis dependent  upon the  . ..  implementation  of the  . .  .\n\ntraffic design  plan .  . .  .\"   We interpret  the district\n\ncourt's  words \"traffic design plan\"  to include a plan that\n\neffectively assures that trucks will not enter  or leave the\n\nfacility by means of the  northern driveway.  That being so,\n\nwe can find no  substantial possibility of an  adverse truck\n\ntraffic impact in Lexington.\n\n          2.    Lexington  also  argues that  the  Service's\n\nplanned improvement of a roadway intersection near Lexington\n\nwill  mean more  traffic  traveling  through  the  town,  as\n\ndrivers  will choose  the improved  route  over other,  more\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\ncongested,  routes.   Lexington,  however, has  produced  no\n\nfactual  data that suggests  this possibility is  other than\n\nspeculative.   Nor can  Lexington plausibly  argue that  the\n\nService  should  have  investigated further  and  found  the\n\nrelevant data, for Lexington initially implied that it liked\n                                                            \n\nthe idea of an intersection improvement, not that it opposed\n\nthe idea.   Lexington  wrote the Service  that it  wanted to\n\n\"understand  the anticipated  benefits  of the  intersection\n                                      \n\nupgrade,\" and it asked the  Service for an analysis of \"what\n\nthe   impact  on  Lexington's  streets  would  be  if  [the]\n\nintersection upgrade does not occur.\"  (App. Vol. 2, p. 646,\n                             \n\nemphasis added).   We  have found nothing  in the  record to\n\nsuggest  that  anyone thought  the intersection  might cause\n\nadded-car-traffic  harm  of  the  sort  that  Lexington  now\n\nmentions.   And, Lexington does  not have the right  to make\n\nnew  arguments  about  this  problem at  this  stage  of the\n\nproceeding.

Waltham  argues   that  the   project  will\n\nsignificantly  and   adversely  affect  a   nearby  wetland,\n\nbasically by reducing the amount of rainwater that would run\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\noff the site into the wetland.  Its expert points to certain\n\nPostal  Service figures that, the expert says, indicate that\n\nthe project would reduce, by about 25% to 30%, the amount of\n\nwater that, during  a rainstorm, now runs  off the buildings\n\nand onto the  wetlands.  The third  environmental assessment\n\nindicates, however, that  rainwater runoff will not  decline\n\nsignificantly.\n\n          The third  assessment, in responding  primarily to\n\nWaltham's earlier claim that the project would discharge too\n                                                            \n\nmuch,   not  too   little,  rainwater   onto   the  wetlands\n    \n\n(threatening them with additional  pollutants), sets forth a\n\ndetailed  stormwater  management  plan, and,  in  doing  so,\n\ndiscusses  the amount  of  rainwater  that  will  leave  the\n\nproject.  It describes water detention basins that keep, but\n\nthen discharge,  water by  means of what  it calls  a \"flow-\n\ndispersing  swale,\" which  discharge  will \"replicat[e]  the\n\nsheet  flow occurring  in a  predeveloped  condition.\"   The\n\nplan,   it   says,   includes    methods   for   encouraging\n\n\"[g]roundwater  recharge.\"   The description  indicates that\n\nthe project will not affect  drainage from the existing roof\n\narea.  It adds that water running off the new roof area will\n\nbe directed partly to a similar \"flow-dispersing swale,\" and\n\npartly   to  a   \"subsurface  recharge  system\"   that  will\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\n\"replenish the  groundwater, avoiding  indirect hydrological\n\nimpacts  on the  nearby wetlands  and stream.\"   Given  this\n\ndiscussion  of   the  storm  water  management  plan,  taken\n\ntogether  with the fact  that the district  court explicitly\n\nconditioned  its judgment \"upon . .  . implementation of the\n\namended  stormwater management  . .  .  plan,\" Waltham,  its\n\nexpert  notwithstanding, has failed  to show any substantial\n\nlikelihood that an environmentally significant lessening  of\n\nrainwater runoff will occur.\n\n          4.  Waltham  says that the Service will  build the\n\nproject in a  wetland area, without complying  with \"wetland\n\nconstruction\"  legal  requirements.    The  district  court,\n\nhowever, found to  the contrary.  The record  shows that the\n\nService collected  relevant information about  the wetlands.\n\nSee 39 C.F.R.   776.5(a).  Furthermore, the third assessment\n   \n\nsays that the project will not involve wetland construction.\n\nThe site  plans, as far  as we understand them,  confirm the\n\nassessment's  statement.  And, Waltham points to no specific\n\nevidence that might  refute the statement.   Regardless, the\n\ndistrict court explicitly made its  judgment \"dependent upon\n\n.  .  .  the  avoidance  of  construction  in  floodplain or\n\nwetlands or the discharge of fill into wetlands.\"\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\n          5.    Waltham  says  that  the  Service's proposed\n\naddition  to the  existing buildings,  as  described in  the\n\nthird  assessment,  is  twice  the  size  of  that  addition\n\ndescribed in  the earlier  assessments, which  fact (Waltham\n\nadds) \"raises a number of issues which must be addressed\" by\n\nthe Service.   One  problem with this  argument lies  in our\n\ninability to  understand  (despite our  examination  of  the\n\nvarious relevant diagrams) how Waltham reached its \"enlarged\n\nbuilding\"  conclusions.     Regardless,  Waltham  does   not\n\nspecifically  or convincingly  explain why  any diagrammatic\n\ninconsistency between  the  earlier  and  later  assessments\n\nwould make  a relevant legal  difference.  A change  in size\n\ndoes   not  automatically   mean   greater,  or   different,\n\nenvironmental  effects than the record describes.  The third\n\nassessment's environmental analysis, after all, concerns the\n\n(allegedly bigger) building  project described in  the third\n\nassessment.  Thus,  the analysis of groundwater  runoff, for\n\nexample, that we  find adequate (for reasons set  out at pp.\n\n15-16, supra)  also seems  adequate in  respect to  whatever\n            \n\n\"enlarged\"  building that  the  third assessment  describes.\n\nWaltham's brief,  in the  portion devoted  to its  \"enlarged\n\nbuilding\" claim, refers generally to  toxic waste and to the\n\ngeneral  appearance of  the  building.    But,  it  provides\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nneither record  citations nor specific  arguments that could\n\nlead us  to conclude  that whatever  changes it  has deduced\n\nfrom the diagrams  make a relevant  difference in these,  or\n\nother, relevant environmental respects.  We therefore cannot\n\naccept its \"enlarged building\" argument.\n\n          6.    Waltham  mentions  the project's  impact  on\n\nnoise.   The district  court, however, pointed  out that the\n\nthird assessment thoroughly analyzed the noise problem.  The\n\ncourt  concluded that,  even without the  various mitigation\n\nmeasures proposed (measures  that postal regulations require\n\nthe  Service to  implement, 39  C.F.R.    775.6(a)(7)),  the\n\nenvironment will suffer no significant impact on noise.  The\n\nstudies support that conclusion.   And, Waltham points to no\n\nsignificantly conflicting evidence.\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\n                            III\n\n                     Procedural Claims\n                                      \n\n          Waltham objects to several of the district court's\n\nprocedural rulings.   We shall  briefly explain why  we find\n\nthese objections without legal merit.\n\n          1.  The district court's decision not to grant the\n                                               \n\ninjunction was embodied in its grant of the Service's motion\n                                    \n\nfor  summary   judgment  and  its   accompanying  denial  of\n                                                        \n\nWaltham's  converse summary  judgment motion.   Waltham says\n\nthat the district  court's own summary judgment  rule, Local\n\nRule 56.1, required  the court to grant  the Waltham motion.\n\nIt points to three parts of the rule:\n\n          a.   The rule says that a party moving for summary\n               judgment must attach \"a  concise statement of\n               material facts  of  record as  to  which  the\n               moving  party contends  there  is no  genuine\n               issue to be tried.\"\n\n          b.   The  rule adds  that the opposing  party must\n               then include \"a concise statement of material\n               facts of record  as to which it  is contended\n               that  there  exists  a  genuine  issue to  be\n               tried.\"\n\n          c.   The rule concludes that  any fact \"set forth\"\n               in  the  moving   party's  statement,  unless\n               \"controverted\"   in   the   opposing  party's\n                            \n               statement,  \"will be  deemed for  purposes of\n               the  motion  to   be  admitted  by   opposing\n                                             \n               parties.\"\n\nLocal Rule, D. Mass. 56.1 (emphases  added).  Waltham points\n\nout that it attached a long statement of facts to its motion\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nfor summary judgment, but the  Service did not attach a list\n                                              \n\nof facts to its opposition.   Hence, says Waltham, the court\n\nshould have  considered its list of facts  \"to be admitted,\"\n\nand  those  facts,  it  believes,  entitled  it  to  summary\n\njudgment (and the injunction).\n\n          The problem with this argument is that the Service\n\ndid  submit a  \"concise statement  of  material facts\"  that\n   \n\n(despite Waltham's own opposing statements, and for  reasons\n\nset out here and in the district court's opinion) adequately\n\nsupported  judgment in  its  favor  --  though  the  Service\n\nphysically  attached that statement  only to its  own motion\n                                                     \n\nfor summary judgment without also physically attaching it to\n                                 \n\nits opposition to Waltham's motion.  The district court held\n\nthat the Service's failure also to attach a duplicate of the\n\ndocument  to its opposition  made no legal  difference (even\n\nthough the Service did not literally comply  with the rule).\n\nAnd, that holding makes perfect sense to us.  After all, the\n\nService's error (failing  to make  an additional  copy of  a\n\ndocument already  in the  record) was  highly technical  and\n\nnonprejudicial.  Waltham, and the court, were fully aware of\n\nthe  Service's view  about the  facts.   Were one  to accept\n\nWaltham's literal interpretation of the local rule, it could\n\nrequire the district court, nonsensically, to grant both the\n                                                        \n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n\nService's  motion (which  all factual  statements adequately\n\nsupport) and  Waltham's conflicting  motion.   The  district\n            \n\ncourt has  authority to  interpret  its own  local rules  in\n\nnontechnical ways and to avoid  such results.

The  district  court's  nonliteral\n\nreading  of the summary judgment rule, creating an exception\n\nfor the present  circumstances, falls well within  the scope\n\nof that legal authority.\n\n          2.   Waltham argues that the district court should\n\nhave  granted its discovery request for \"two filing cabinets\n\nfull\"  of  material  that the  Service  compiled  during the\n\ncourse  of  its  environmental  investigations.   The  court\n\ndenied  the  request  because  it  accepted   the  Service's\n\nstatement that it  had not relied upon any  of this material\n\nin reaching any of the here-relevant conclusions.

Waltham  has  not\n                   \n\nprovided us with any basis  for finding a violation of these\n\nlegal standards.\n\n          3.   Waltham  argues that  the  court should  have\n\nordered the Service to provide it with a document called the\n\n\"Berger assessment\" -- a document  that apparently discusses\n\nthe  environmental effects of  choosing other sites  for the\n\nnew  facility.    Waltham,  however,  has  not  convincingly\n\nexplained why the document  is relevant to the  legal issues\n\nbefore us  in this case.  And, it  provides us with no basis\n\nfor  finding that  the district  court violated  any of  the\n\nlegal standards described in the preceding paragraph.\n\n          4.  Waltham asked the  district court not to admit\n\nin  evidence a  letter  from the  Service  proposing to  pay\n\nWaltham $1.6 million for roadway improvements.  The district\n\ncourt did  not rule on  Waltham's claim that the  letter was\n\nnot properly authenticated.  The letter, in our view, has no\n\nsignificance.  Other documents,  properly admitted, say that\n\nthe  Service was  willing to  pay  Waltham $1.5  million for\n\nroadway improvements.   And, we do not see  how the $100,000\n\ndifference  (between  the  $1.6  million  and  $1.5  million\n\noffers) could  make any  difference to  the outcome  of this\n\ncase.   We have  not considered the  $1.6 million  letter in\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\nreaching  our decision.   Insofar as the  district court may\n\nhave done so (say, in  respect to traffic impact), any error\n\nis harmless.   United  States v.

Waltham has made various claims to  the effect\n\nthat the Postal  Service has acted in \"bad faith.\"   We have\n\nnot found in the record, however, specific  evidence of \"bad\n\nfaith\"  sufficient to  invalidate  the Service's  finding in\n\nrespect to the  lack of adverse  environmental impact or  to\n\ndemonstrate  a  violation  of any  other  relevant  law that\n\nWaltham has mentioned.\n\n                             IV\n\n                   Adequate Consultation\n                                        \n\n          1.   The law requires  the Service to consult with\n\nlocal  authorities about its project.  The Intergovernmental\n\nCooperation Act (\"ICA\"), for example, says that\n\n          [t]o  the extent  possible,  all  . .  .\n          local viewpoints  shall be considered in\n          planning   development    programs   and\n          projects . . . . \n\nICA   401(c), 31 U.S.C.   6506(c).\n\n          An Executive Order,  elaborating this requirement,\nsays\n\n          [f]ederal    agencies   shall    provide\n          opportunities   for    consultation   by\n\n                            -24-\n                             24\n\n          elected  officials  of those  State  and\n          local governments  . .  . that  would be\n          directly  affected  by  .  .  .   direct\n          Federal development . . . .\n\nMoreover, \n\n          [f]or  those  cases where  the  concerns\n          cannot    be    accommodated,    Federal\n          officials  shall explain  the bases  for\n          their decision in a timely manner.\n\nExec. Order No. 12,372, 47 Fed. Reg. 30,959 (1982).\n\n          Waltham  claims that  the  Service violated  these\n\nlegal obligations.   It concedes that Service  employees met\n\nwith Waltham  officials many times.   It does not  deny, for\n\nexample, the  accuracy of an  affidavit that refers  to such\n\nmeetings  in October 1989, January, March, June (two), July,\n\nSeptember, October, November  and December  1990, and  March\n\nand May 1991.  But,  says Waltham, all pre-May 1990 meetings\n\nconcerned  other possible  project  sites, and  all post-May\n                \n\n1990   meetings  took  place  only  after  the  Service  had\n\ndeveloped a \"bureaucratic commitment\" to the present site --\n\nwhich  fact,  in  Waltham's view,  makes  the  post-May 1990\n\nmeetings irrelevant.\n\n          In  our  view,  neither  the  Act  nor  the  Order\n\nrequires  a federal agency to begin consultations before the\n\nagency makes any commitment to a particular project or takes\n                \n\nany steps towards  carrying out such a project.   Nothing in\n   \n\n                            -25-\n                             25\n\nthe  Act or Order  suggests an intent  to integrate federal,\n\nstate, and local  bureaucracies to the extent  that any such\n\ninterpretation would require.  Nor does the language of  the\n\nAct  or Order  suggest  an  intent to  give  state or  local\n\nofficials  the right to  veto federal projects,  where, say,\n\nspeed is important or practical considerations indicate that\n\na degree  of pre-consultation federal  bureaucratic activity\n\nis  desirable.    Rather,  the  relevant  statutory language\n\nsimply  requires  \"consider[ation]\"  of  \"local  viewpoints\"\n\nduring the  \"planning\"  stages  of  a  project.    In  these\n\nrespects it  is quite different  from the language  of, say,\n\nNEPA, a  statute that insists that \"a  detailed statement by\n\nthe  responsible official on the environmental impact of the\n\nproposed action\"  be  included in  \"every recommendation  or\n\nreport  on  proposals  for  .  .  .  major  Federal  actions\n\nsignificantly   affecting   the   quality   of   the   human\n\nenvironment,\" that  is, at  the time  when  the decision  to\n\nwhich  NEPA obligations  attach is  made.   NEPA    102,  42\n\nU.S.C.   4332(C)(i); see also Watt, 716 F.2d at 952.\n                                  \n\n          With these provisions  in mind,  we have  examined\n\nthe record.   We find the record indicates  that the Service\n\nprovided meaningful consultation, considered local points of\n\nview, and  made  reasonable  efforts  to  accommodate  local\n\n                            -26-\n                             26\n\nconcerns.  Publication of the first environmental assessment\n\nin   May  1990  did  not  preclude  subsequent,  meaningful,\n\nconsultation,   consideration,  and   accommodation.     The\n\ndevelopment of further assessments, the changes subsequently\n\nmade to mitigate potentially adverse environmental  effects,\n\nand  other  related  changes,  all  show  that  the  Service\n\nlistened   to   local   viewpoints   and   made   reasonable\n\naccommodation  efforts.     Waltham   strongly  states   the\n\ncontrary,  but  it   does  not  point  to   record  evidence\n\nsufficient to show either a lack of meaningful consultations\n\nor  a failure  to take  local points  of view  into account,\n\nwhether those  consultations and  accommodations took  place\n\nbefore, or only after, May 1990.\n\n          2.  Waltham says that the Service has violated the\n\nExecutive  Order (or  the  Act)  because  the  project  will\n\ndiminish local tax revenues by $560,000, and the Service did\n\nnot  adequately  address  these tax  consequences.    We are\n\nwilling to assume,  for argument's sake, that  the Executive\n\nOrder  imposes upon  the federal  government an  obligation,\n\nlegally  enforceable  in  present  circumstances,  to   make\n\n\"efforts  to accommodate\" local concerns and \"to explain the\n\nbases for their decision\" when they do not accommodate local\n\nconcerns.  But still, the Executive Order would not prohibit\n\n                            -27-\n                             27\n\nthe  federal government  from  removing local  property from\n\nstate  and local  tax rolls.   It  would simply  require the\n\ngovernment  to have  a sensible,  understandable  reason for\n\ndoing so.  In this  case, the adverse local tax consequences\n\nunderstandably flow from the federal government's need for a\n\nnew postal facility  and its decision to build that facility\n\nin Waltham.  More importantly, the Service  did consider the\n\ntax consequences of  its action.  The  initial environmental\n\nassessment  identifies the issue  and says that  the Service\n\nhad \"agreed to provide  infrastructure improvements in  lieu\n\nof taxes,\" as does the second assessment.  Waltham points to\n\nno  specific evidence  that might show,  in this  respect, a\n\nviolation of the Act or Order.\n\n          3. Waltham  makes  a similar  complaint about  the\n\nService's  consideration of zoning  issues.  Both  the first\n\nand  second  environmental   assessments,  however,  discuss\n\nzoning issues.  The  assessment notes that the new  facility\n\nwould technically be a nonconforming use,  but that it would\n\n\"not  significantly change  the existing  land  use from  an\n\naesthetics perspective\" and that the previous owner's use of\n\nthe  property was  similar to  the  Service's proposed  use.\n\nWaltham  has  not  pointed  to  any  specific zoning-related\n\nproblem that might show a violation of the Act or the Order.\n\n                            -28-\n                             28\n\n          4. Lexington points  to Postal Service regulations\n\nthat  require  the Service  to  notify  it of  any  proposed\n\nenvironmental  assessment  before  the  Service  makes  that\n\nassessment.   39 C.F.R.     775.7(b), 775.10(a).   Lexington\n\nadds that it did not  receive notice prior to publication of\n\nthe  first environmental assessment  in May 1990.   Assuming\n\n(as  did the district  court) for summary  judgment purposes\n\nthat this is  so, the notice failure  still does not  make a\n\nsignificant  legal difference.  That is because the Service,\n\nafter  May  1990,  provided   Lexington  with  an   adequate\n\nopportunity  to comment,  particularly  about the  potential\n\ntraffic problems that  concerned the town.   And, subsequent\n\nto May 1990  the Service  prepared additional  environmental\n\nassessments   and  consulted   with   Lexington.     Because\n\nmeaningful consultation subsequently took  place, any notice\n\nviolation,  in the district  court's view, was  harmless and\n\ndid  not warrant  an  injunction.    The  record  adequately\n\nsupports  the conclusion that  any such violation  would not\n\nsignificantly affect the quality of the environment.\n\n                             V\n\n                    The Clean Water Act\n                                       \n\n          Waltham argues  that the Service  has violated the\n\nClean  Water Act,  33 U.S.C.     1342,  1344, by  failing to\n\n                            -29-\n                             29\n\nobtain  two necessary permits:  1) a permit  that allows the\n\ndischarge of  material onto  wetlands and  2) a  permit that\n\nallows the discharge  of pollutants.  We do  not believe the\n\nClean Water  Act requires  the Service  to obtain  the first\n\npermit because the  third assessment makes clear  that there\n\nwill not be  sufficient discharge of material  onto wetlands\n\nto  trigger the permit  requirement.  See  pp. 16-17, supra.\n                                                           \n\nThe Service concedes that it needs the second permit, and it\n\nis  in the  process of  obtaining  it.   The district  court\n\nspecified that  its \"judgment  . . .  is dependent  upon the\n\nissuance of [that] permit.\"  We therefore see no need for an\n\ninjunction.   Weinberger  v.
