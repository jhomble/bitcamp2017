Jose  Quezada  appeals  from  his\n                     \n\nconviction and  sentence.   He was indicted  on one  count of\n\npossessing  heroin with  intent to distribute.   He  moved to\n\nsuppress evidence seized  from his home, on  the grounds that\n\nthe  warrant  authorizing  the search  was  not  supported by\n\nprobable  cause.  After a  hearing, the district court denied\n\nthe motion.    Quezada pled  guilty  and the  district  court\n\nsentenced  him to  27 months  in prison.   In  estimating the\n\nquantity  of  heroin for  sentencing  purposes,  the district\n\ncourt relied, in part, on \n\n$2,321 in cash found during the search  of his apartment.  He\n\nappeals  his sentence  and  the  denial  of  his  suppression\n\nmotion.\n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          The  presentence   report  (\"PSR\")   contained  the\n\nfollowing summary  of  the facts  underlying this  case.   An\n\ninformant (known  to  the Johnston  Police  Department)  told\n\ndetectives  of the Providence  Police Department that  a man,\n\nwhom the informant  identified from a photograph  as Quezada,\n\nwould  be arriving  on October, 14,  1992 at  9:00 p.m.  at a\n\ncertain  location in  a burgundy  van  containing heroin  for\n\nsale. The detectives  set up watch at  the specified location\n\nand at 9:00 appellant arrived in a burgundy van.  Approaching\n\nthe  van,  the detectives  saw  Quezada  throw  a  gray  box,\n\ncommonly used to store heroin, into the back of the van.  The\n\n                             -2-\n\ndetectives arrested  Quezada and  seized the  box, containing\n\n500 glassine envelopes  of heroin, and $206 in  cash found in\n\nQuezada's pocket.\n\n          Later that night, the detectives executed a  search\n\nwarrant at Quezada's home.  They seized 781  glassine packets\n\nof heroin  and the  following articles  commonly used in  the\n\npackaging  of  heroin:  a  coffee  grinder,  boxes  of  empty\n\nglassine  packets (some  stamped  \"shoot  to kill\"),  elastic\n\nbands, an ink  pad and a  \"shoot to kill\"  stamp.  They  also\n\nseized a pager and $ 2,321 in cash.  After being  informed of\n\nhis Miranda rights, Quezada signed a statement admitting that\n           \n\nthe drugs seized  from the van and his  apartment belonged to\n\nhim.   A subsequent  laboratory analysis  concluded that  the\n\nweight of the total amount of heroin seized was between 15.26\n\ngrams and 18.22 grams.\n\n          In  November,  1992, Quezada  was  indicted  on one\n\ncount  of  possession  with intent  to  distribute  heroin in\n\nviolation of  21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1).  In December,  1992, he\n\nfiled a  motion to suppress  the drugs seized by  the police.\n\nFollowing an evidentiary hearing,  the district court  denied\n\nthe motion.  On June 15, 1993, appellant pled guilty.   \n\n          For purposes of calculating  the base offense level\n\n(\"BOL\"),the probation officer who prepared  the PSR converted\n\nthe  cash  seized  from Quezada's  pocket  and  his apartment\n\n($2,527) into an  equivalent amount of heroin  (14.17 grams).\n\n                             -3-\n\nHe  relied   upon  information  from  the   Drug  Enforcement\n\nAdministration that an ounce of heroin was then selling for \n\n$5,000.   He  then added  the 14.7  grams to  the amounts  of\n\nheroin seized to arrive  at a total weight of  29.43 to 32.39\n\ngrams.   That  amount of  heroin yielded  a BOL  of 18  under\n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.1 (c) (13). 1  The district  court adopted the\n\nBOL  of  18  and  then applied  a  three-point  reduction for\n\nQuezada's acceptance of  responsibility.  The PSR  included a\n\nstatement  by Quezada  admitting that  he  had committed  the\n\noffenses charged and acknowledging that \"the drugs the police\n\nfound [at my house]  were to sell.\"  The total  offense level\n\nof 15 and Quezada's criminal history category of 2 yielded an\n\nimprisonment range of 21 to 27 months. \n\n          On August  17, 1993,  the district  court sentenced\n\nappellant to 27 months in prison and five years of supervised\n\nrelease.  As a condition of supervised  release, the district\n\ncourt  ordered appellant,  at the  completion of his  term of\n\nimprisonment, to  be surrendered to  an immigration  official\n\nfor deportation. \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          Quezada makes three arguments on appeal.  First, he\n\nargues that the district court erred in denying his motion to\n\nsuppress.   Second, he challenges his  sentence as based upon\n\n                    \n\n1.   The Sentencing  Guidelines applied were those  in effect\non the date appellant was sentenced.\n\n                             -4-\n\nillegally-seized evidence.  Finally, Quezada contends that it\n\nwas  error for  the district  court to  convert cash  into an\n\nequivalent amount of  heroin for purposes of  calculating his\n\nsentence.  We reject all three arguments.\n\n          In pleading  guilty, Quezada  did  not reserve  the\n\nright to  appeal from the  denial of his motion  to suppress.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2) (allowing  conditional pleas to\n   \n\nbe  entered,  with  the consent  of  the  government  and the\n\napproval  of the court,  by defendant's reserving  in writing\n\nthe right to appeal a pre-trial motion).  \"It is clear that a\n\nplea of guilty to an indictment is  an admission of guilt and\n\na waiver of  all non-jurisdictional defenses.\"  Acevedo-Ramos\n                                                             \n\nv. United States, 961 F.2d  305, 308 (1st Cir.) (holding that\n                \n\nby pleading  guilty, defendant waived statute  of limitations\n\ndefense),  cert. denied,     U.S.     , 113 S.Ct. 299 (1992).\n                       \n\nTherefore, Quezada's guilty  plea forecloses from review  the\n\ndenial of his motion to suppress.  \n\n          Quezada's  guilty   plea  also   bars  his   Fourth\n\nAmendment challenge to  his sentence.  The Supreme  Court has\n\nexplained the effect of a guilty plea as follows:\n\n          [A] guilty plea represents a break in the\n          chain of events which has preceded it  in\n          the  criminal process.   When  a criminal\n          defendant has  solemnly admitted  in open\n          court  that he is  in fact guilty  of the\n          offense with  which he is charged, he may\n          not thereafter  raise independent  claims\n          relating    to    the    deprivation   of\n          constitutional rights that occurred prior\n          to the entry of the guilty plea.\n\n                             -5-\n\nTollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S.  258, 267 (1973).  By pleading\n                    \n\nguilty,  appellant  waived  the right  to  assert  his Fourth\n\nAmendment  claim for the  purpose of attacking  his sentence.\n\nSee  United States  v. Smallwood,  920 F.2d  1231, 1240  (5th\n                                \n\nCir.) (holding that, following the district court's denial of\n\nappellant's  motion  to suppress  and  appellant's subsequent\n\nguilty plea,  appellant \"cannot resuscitate  fourth amendment\n\nconcerns solely to challenge the consideration of evidence at\n\nsentencing.\"), cert.  denied,      U.S.    ,  111 S.Ct.  2870\n                            \n\n(1991).\n\n          Quezada  contests on  appeal,  as  he  did  at  his\n\nsentencing hearing, the  government's conversion of  the cash\n\nfound in  his apartment into  an equivalent amount  of heroin\n\nfor purposes of calculating appellant's BOL.  He  argues that\n\nthere was  insufficient evidence  that the  cash belonged  to\n\nhim, given that  he shared the apartment with  others and the\n\nPSI failed  to indicate where  in the apartment the  cash was\n\nfound.  Appellant  also contends that there  was insufficient\n\nproof to support  the probation officer's assertion  that the\n\ncash   was   \"the   direct  result   of   previous  narcotics\n\ntrafficking.\"  He  cites his employment at an  auto body shop\n\nat the time  of the search  in support  of his argument  that\n\nthere were other plausible sources of the cash. \n\n          For  the first time on appeal, Quezada contests the\n\nconversion ratio used by the probation officer and adopted by\n\n                             -6-\n\nthe  district  court  (one ounce  of  heroin  equals $5,000).\n\nHaving failed to object below to the conversion ratio used in\n\nthe PSR,  however, Quezada is barred from  raising this issue\n\nfor  the first time on  appeal.  United  States v. Jackson, 3\n                                                          \n\nF.2d 506, 511 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          \"Pursuant to U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(2), a defendant is\n\nresponsible for all acts which  'were part of the same course\n\nof  conduct   or  common  scheme  or  plan  as  the  offenses\n\ncharged.'\" United  States v.  Figueroa, 976  F.2d 1446,  1461\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir. 1992),  cert. denied,     U.S.    ,  113 S.Ct. 1346\n                              \n\n(1993).  In United States v. Gerante,  891 F.2d 364, 369 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1989), we held that Application Note 2 of the Commentary\n\nto U.S.S.G.    2D1.4 authorizes  a district court  to convert\n\ncash into a drug amount for the purpose of calculating a base\n\noffense  level,  provided  that  the  cash  \"represents  drug\n\ntransactions that are  part of the same course  of conduct as\n\nthe instant offense.\" United States v. Jackson, 3 F.2d at 510\n                                              \n\n(citing Gerante, 891 F.2d at 369).  \n               \n\n          A   finding  by   the  district  court   that  cash\n\nrepresents drug transactions that are part of the same course\n\nof  conduct as  the charged  offense must  be supported  by a\n\npreponderance of the  evidence.  United States  v. Jackson, 3\n                                                          \n\nF.3d   at  510.     At  the  sentencing   hearing,  appellant\n\nchallenged,   as  unsupported  by   a  preponderance  of  the\n\nevidence, the PSI's assertion that  the cash seized from  his\n\n                             -7-\n\napartment \"was  the direct  result of  narcotics trafficking\"\n\nand,  therefore,  \"relevant  conduct\"  for  the  purposes  of\n\ndetermining the BOL.  \n\n          As  required by Fed.  R. Crim. P.  32(c)(3)(D), the\n\ndistrict court  made a finding  as to the  alleged inaccuracy\n\ncontained in the PSI.  The district court found as follows:\n\n          [the  seizure  of   heroin  and  numerous\n          articles used in the  packaging of heroin\n          and  the defendant's  admission that  the\n          drugs found were  his and that  they were\n          there to  sell] certainly  indicates that\n          this  defendant was  heavily involved  in\n          the  heroin  trafficking business  and  I\n          join  hands with the Probation Officer in\n          the statement that he made that he stands\n          firm in his belief that the $2,527 seized\n          from the defendant's  person and his  own\n          apartment  are the  proceeds of  previous\n          heroin trafficking, and,  therefore, it's\n          considered  relevant   conduct  for   the\n          purpose  of  determining   the  guideline\n          range.\n\nThe  district court  also stated  that, with  respect to  the\n\nsource of the cash  and its connection to Quezada, \"I  do not\n\nattach much significance to the defendant's argument.\"\n\n          These  findings of fact  by the district  court are\n\nreviewable only  for  clear  error.   See  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nJackson, 3 F.2d at 510; United States v. Gerante, 891 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n368.  We cannot say that the sentencing judge committed clear\n\nerror in concluding  that the  government met  its burden  of\n\nproving  by a  preponderance of  the  evidence that  the cash\n\nseized represented  proceeds of previous  heroin trafficking.\n\nSee United States  v. Sepulveda, Nos.  92-1362, et al.,  slip\n                               \n\n                             -8-\n\nop.  at  81 (1st  Cir.  Dec.  20,  1993) (holding  that  \"the\n\ngovernment presented abundant evidence of Johnson's narcotics\n\ntrafficking, .  . . ,  and the volume of  business transacted\n\njustified  the court's  illation that  the  sums seized  were\n\nconnected to her drug dealings.\").\n\n          Quezada argued at his  sentencing hearing that  the\n\nevidence  suggested  that  there were  others  living  at his\n\napartment,  including a  woman,  children  and someone  named\n\nRodriguez.   Quezada  did not  produce any  such person  as a\n\nwitness  at the hearing,  however, to testify  that the money\n\nwas theirs.  Nor did  appellant offer any evidence to support\n\nhis contention that  he was employed at an  auto body shop at\n\nthe time of his  arrest.  The probation officer was unable to\n\nverify the alleged employment.  Appellant did not provide any\n\nproof  of employment,  (such as  paycheck  stubs) and  relied\n\nsolely  on a  statement  by  his wife  that  he  had been  so\n\nemployed.    Moreover,  the district  court  would  have been\n\njustified in concluding that legitimate employment would  not\n\nnecessarily  explain the presence of large amounts of cash in\n\nQuezada's apartment.  As in  United States v. Jackson, 3 F.2d\n                                                     \n\nat  511,  the  sentencing court  here  \"rejected  the various\n\nalternative sources of  the currency and determined  that the\n\nfunds were drug proceeds.\"  It did not commit clear error  in\n\nmaking that determination.\n\n                             -9-\n\n          The conviction  and sentence are  affirmed pursuant\n\nto Loc.

He moved to suppress evidence seized from his home, on the grounds that the warrant authorizing the search was not supported by probable cause.  After a hearing, the district court denied the motion.  Quezada pled guilty and the district court sentenced him to 27 months in prison.

They also seized a pager and $ 2,321 in cash.  After being informed of his Miranda rights, Quezada signed a statement admitting that the drugs seized from the van and his apartment belonged to him.

He then added the 14.7 grams to the amounts of heroin seized to arrive at a total weight of 29.43 to 32.39 grams.  That amount of heroin yielded a BOL of 18 under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1 (c)(13).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court adopted the BOL of 18 and then applied a three-point reduction for Quezada's acceptance of responsibility.  The PSR included a statement by Quezada admitting that he had committed the offenses charged and acknowledging that \"the drugs the police found [at my house] were to sell.\"  The total offense level of 15 and Quezada's criminal history category of 2 yielded an imprisonment range of 21 to 27 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 17, 1993, the district court sentenced appellant to 27 months in prison and five years of supervised release.

First, he argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress.  Second, he challenges his sentence as based upon illegally-seized evidence.  Finally, Quezada contends that it was error for the district court to convert cash into an equivalent amount of heroin for purposes of calculating his sentence.  We reject all three arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In pleading guilty, Quezada did not reserve the right to appeal from the denial of his motion to suppress.  See Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11(a)(2) (allowing conditional pleas to be entered, with the consent of the government and the approval of the court, by defendant's reserving in writing the right to appeal a pre-trial motion).  \"It is clear that a plea of guilty to an indictment is an admission of guilt and a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defenses.\"   Acevedo-Ramos v. United States, 961 F.2d 305, 308 (1st Cir.)  (holding that by pleading guilty, defendant waived statute of limitations defense), cert. denied,  U.S., 113 S.Ct. 299 (1992).

Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973).  By pleading guilty, appellant waived the right to assert his Fourth Amendment claim for the purpose of attacking his sentence.   See United States v. Smallwood, 920 F.2d 1231, 1240 (5th Cir.)  (holding that, following the district court's denial of appellant's motion to suppress and appellant's subsequent guilty plea, appellant \"cannot resuscitate fourth amendment concerns solely to challenge the consideration of evidence at sentencing.\"), cert. denied,  U.S., 111 S.Ct. 2870 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quezada contests on appeal, as he did at his sentencing hearing, the government's conversion of the cash found in his apartment into an equivalent amount of heroin for purposes of calculating appellant's BOL.  He argues that there was insufficient evidence that the cash belonged to him, given that he shared the apartment with others and the PSI failed to indicate where in the apartment the cash was found.  Appellant also contends that there was insufficient proof to support the probation officer's assertion that the cash was \"the direct result of previous narcotics trafficking.\"  He cites his employment at an auto body shop at the time of the search in support of his argument that there were other plausible sources of the cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time on appeal, Quezada contests the conversion ratio used by the probation officer and adopted by the district court (one ounce of heroin equals $5,000).  Having failed to object below to the conversion ratio used in the PSR, however, Quezada is barred from raising this issue for the first time on appeal.  United States v.

We cannot say that the sentencing judge committed clear error in concluding that the government met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the cash seized represented proceeds of previous heroin trafficking.

Quezada did not produce any such person as a witness at the hearing, however, to testify that the money was theirs.  Nor did appellant offer any evidence to support his contention that he was employed at an auto body shop at the time of his arrest.  The probation officer was unable to verify the alleged employment.  Appellant did not provide any proof of employment, (such as paycheck stubs) and relied solely on a statement by his wife that he had been so employed.  Moreover, the district court would have been justified in concluding that legitimate employment would not necessarily explain the presence of large amounts of cash in Quezada's apartment.  As in United States v.

He was indicted on one count of possessing heroin with intent to distribute.  He moved to suppress evidence seized from his home, on the grounds that the warrant authorizing the search was not supported by probable cause.  After a hearing, the district court denied the motion.  Quezada pled guilty and the district court sentenced him to 27 months in prison.  In estimating the quantity of heroin for sentencing purposes, the district court relied, in part, on $2,321 in cash found during the search of his apartment.  He appeals his sentence and the denial of his suppression motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report (\"PSR\") contained the following summary of the facts underlying this case.  An informant (known to the Johnston Police Department) told detectives of the Providence Police Department that a man, whom the informant identified from a photograph as Quezada, would be arriving on October, 14, 1992 at 9:00 p.m.  at a certain location in a burgundy van containing heroin for sale.  The detectives set up watch at the specified location and at 9:00 appellant arrived in a burgundy van.  Approaching the van, the detectives saw Quezada throw a gray box, commonly used to store heroin, into the back of the van.  The detectives arrested Quezada and seized the box, containing 500 glassine envelopes of heroin, and $206 in cash found in Quezada's pocket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that night, the detectives executed a search warrant at Quezada's home.  They seized 781 glassine packets of heroin and the following articles commonly used in the packaging of heroin:  a coffee grinder, boxes of empty glassine packets (some stamped \"shoot to kill\"), elastic bands, an ink pad and a \"shoot to kill\" stamp.  They also seized a pager and $ 2,321 in cash.  After being informed of his Miranda rights, Quezada signed a statement admitting that the drugs seized from the van and his apartment belonged to him.  A subsequent laboratory analysis concluded that the weight of the total amount of heroin seized was between 15.26 grams and 18.22 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, 1992, Quezada was indicted on one count of possession with intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C.

Appellant did not provide any proof of employment, (such as paycheck stubs) and relied solely on a statement by his wife that he had been so employed.  Moreover, the district court would have been justified in concluding that legitimate employment would not necessarily explain the presence of large amounts of cash in Quezada's apartment.  As in United States v. Jackson, 3 F.2d at 511, the sentencing court here \"rejected the various alternative sources of the currency and determined that the funds were drug proceeds.\"  It did not commit clear error in making that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conviction and sentence are affirmed pursuant to Loc.
