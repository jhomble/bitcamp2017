In this  appeal, we  consider\n          SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\n                               \n\nwhether larceny from the person is a crime of violence within the\n\nmeaning of the federal sentencing guidelines.  Because  we answer\n\nthat  question  affirmatively, defendant's  prior  conviction for\n\nthat  crime qualifies as  a predicate offense,  requiring that we\n\naffirm his enhanced sentence as a career offender.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The  career offender guideline  elevates the sentencing\n\nrange of  a defendant who, being at  least eighteen years old and\n\nhaving previously  been convicted  of  \"at least  2 prior  felony\n\nconvictions  of  either  a  crime of  violence  or  a  controlled\n\nsubstance offense,\" is found  guilty of a federal felony  that is\n\nitself  either  a crime  of  violence or  a  controlled substance\n\noffense.   U.S.S.G.    4B1.1.1  On January  21, 1992,  defendant-\n\nappellant  Carlos  De  Jesus  pled guilty  to  federal  narcotics\n\noffenses  in  violation of  21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1),  846, 860(a)\n\n(1988)   and  18  U.S.C.      2  (1988).     In  the  presentence\n\ninvestigation   report  (PSI   Report),  the   probation  officer\n\nrecommended that appellant be sentenced as a career offender.  In\n\nsupport  of the  predicate  offense requirement,  the PSI  Report\n\nlimned five prior offenses, viz., a conviction for  possession of\n                                \n\n                    \n\n     1Unless   otherwise  indicated,   all   references  to   the\nsentencing guidelines are to  the November 1991 version.   See 18\n                                                              \nU.S.C.    3553(a)(4)-(5)(1988) (instructing a sentencing court to\nconsider the guidelines and  policy statements \"in effect on  the\ndate  the defendant  is sentenced\");  see also  United States  v.\n                                                             \nHarotunian, 920  F.2d 1040,  1041-42 (1st Cir.  1990) (explaining\n          \nthat, save for any  ex post facto complications, \"a  defendant is\n                                 \nto  be punished according to the guidelines in effect at the time\nof sentencing\").\n\n                                3\n\nheroin with  intent to distribute, two  diversionary dispositions\n\nfor  assault and  battery  that were  placed  on file  without  a\n\nfinding  of guilt,  a  diversionary disposition  for assault  and\n\nbattery  that was placed on file after  a finding of guilt, and a\n\nconviction for larceny from the person.2 \n\n          At sentencing,  the  district  court  adopted  the  PSI\n\nReport's recommendation, branded appellant a career offender, and\n\nset  the guideline  sentencing  range (GSR)  at 210-262  months.3\n\nThe  court then  granted a  government motion  filed pursuant  to\n\nU.S.S.G.   5K1.1 and departed downward in tribute to  appellant's\n\nsubstantial  assistance, sentencing  him  to a  60-month term  of\n\nincarceration.\n\n          Appellant objects  to his  classification  as a  career\n\noffender.   He  acknowledges that  his conviction  for possessing\n\nheroin  with  intent  to  distribute  is  a  countable  predicate\n\noffense, but  protests that there is  no other.  Thus,  he claims\n\nthat  the  government  failed  to  show  the  requisite  pair  of\n\npredicate offenses.\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          Although the lower court determined that De Jesus was a\n\ncareer offender, it  made no express finding  as to which  of his\n\npast escapades constituted predicate  offenses within the meaning\n\n                    \n\n     2The first three dispositions occurred on November 24, 1987;\nthe last two  dispositions occurred on April 10, 1990.   All five\ncases were prosecuted in a Massachusetts state court.\n\n     3Both sides  agree that, apart from  career offender status,\nthe GSR would have been 46-57 months.\n\n                                4\n\nof U.S.S.G.   4B1.1.   Because appellant admits the  incidence of\n\none  predicate offense (for peddling heroin), our sole task is to\n\ndetermine  whether  the record  supports  the  sentencing court's\n\nimplicit finding  of a  second predicate  offense.4  We  approach\n\nthis task with an awareness that, so long as any one of the other\n\ndispositions  catalogued in  the PSI  Report qualifies  under the\n\ncareer offender rubric, De Jesus's appeal founders.\n\n                                A\n\n          Because we  believe it is relatively  clearcut, we turn\n\nfirst to the issue of whether appellant's conviction for  larceny\n\nfrom  the  person constitutes  a  predicate  offense.   Appellant\n\nclaims that this conviction cannot trigger career offender status\n\nbecause the crime charged,  a violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266,\n\n   25(b) (1990), does not  constitute a crime  of violence within\n\nthe meaning of the sentencing guidelines.  We do not agree.\n\n          The  Sentencing  Commission  has  defined  a  crime  of\n\nviolence as a federal or state offense punishable by imprisonment\n\nfor more than one year that:\n\n          (i)   has  as an  element the  use, attempted\n          use,  or  threatened  use of  physical  force\n          against the  person of  another,  or (ii)  is\n          burglary  of a dwelling, arson, or extortion,\n\n                    \n\n     4Although  the lack  of express  findings is  a complicating\nfactor, it does not  frustrate appellate review.  After  all, the\nquestion of whether a crime qualifies as a predicate offense is a\nquestion of  law and, hence, our  review is plenary.   See United\n                                                                 \nStates v. Fiore,      F.2d    ,     (1st Cir. 1992) [No. 92-1601,\n                                   \nslip  op. at 3].   Therefore, this  appeal can proceed.   We take\nthis opportunity, however, to emphasize that  reasonably complete\nfindings  at  the trial  court  level  invariably facilitate  the\nappellate  task and to urge district judges to make such findings\nwherever possible.\n\n                                5\n\n          involves  use  of  explosives,  or  otherwise\n          involves  conduct  that  presents  a  serious\n          potential risk of physical injury to another.\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1).  A formal categorical approach   an approach\n\nthat looks to  a prior offense's statutory provenance rather than\n\nto its  actual facts    is the  method of choice  for determining\n\nwhether a  felony constitutes a targeted crime within the meaning\n\nof this definition.  See  United States v. Fiore,      F.2d     ,\n                                                                \n\n    (1st Cir.  1992) [No. 92-1601, slip op. at  5]; United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Bell, 966  F.2d 703, 704  (1st Cir. 1992);  accord U.S.S.G.   \n                                                     \n\n4B1.2, comment (n.2) (directing  judicial inquiry to \"the conduct\n\nset forth (i.e.,  expressly charged)  in the count  of which  the\n               \n\ndefendant was convicted\"); cf. Taylor v. United States,  495 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n575,  600  (1990)  (adopting  categorical  approach  for  similar\n\ndefinitional  inquiries  under  the Armed  Career  Criminal Act);\n\nUnited  States v.  Doe,  960 F.2d  221,  223-24 (1st  Cir.  1992)\n                      \n\n(same).   Thus,  rather than  examining the  actual circumstances\n\nunderlying the earlier conviction,  we examine only the statutory\n\nformulation of the crime charged  (here, larceny from the person)\n\nto see if that crime  is a crime of violence for purposes  of the\n\ncareer offender guideline.5\n\n                    \n\n     5To  be sure,  there  are certain  limited circumstances  in\nwhich  a court  may appropriately  peruse documents  such as  the\ncharging  papers or  jury instructions  in order  to flesh  out a\npredicate offense inquiry.   See, e.g., Taylor, 495 U.S.  at 602.\n                                              \nIn  this  instance, however,  we see  no  reason either  to reach\nbeyond the statutory parameter or to consider the extent to which\nour opinion in United States  v. Harris, 964 F.2d 1234 (1st  Cir.\n                                       \n1992),  does  or  does not  permit  resort  to  the PSI  Report's\ndepiction  of the  underlying events  and/or the  defendant's own\nversion of the facts as outlined in the Report's addendum.\n\n                                6\n\n                                B\n\n          The state statute in  question authorizes a prison term\n\nof up  to five  years for  one who \"steal[s]  from the  person of\n\nanother.\"   Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 266,    25(b).  Massachusetts  law\n\nmakes clear that, in order to satisfy \"the essential elements\" of\n\nthe  statutory definition,  the  taking  need  not  be  from  the\n\nvictim's person  so long  as  it is  \"from  the presence  of  the\n\nvictim,\"   that  is,   from   \"within  his   area  of   control.\"\n\nCommonwealth v.  Subilosky, 352 Mass.  153, 166, 224  N.E.2d 197,\n                          \n\n206  (1967)  (internal  quotation  marks and  citation  omitted).\n\nUsing  this  rendition  of   Massachusetts  law  as  a  doctrinal\n\nspringboard, appellant argues that his earlier conviction was not\n\nfor  a \"crime of violence\" as that  term is defined in the career\n\noffender guideline.\n\n          Appellant's  argument  has  some superficial  allure.  \n\nBecause actual  or threatened use of  force is not an  element of\n\nthe  offense in Massachusetts,  larceny from the  person does not\n\nfit  within subsection (i) of  U.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1).   The puzzle,\n\nhowever,  is not  so  easily solved;  even  if force  (actual  or\n\nthreatened) is  not an element of the  offense, a crime may still\n\nbe a crime  of violence if it falls within the \"otherwise\" clause\n\nof  subsection  (ii), that  is,  if  it  \"involves  conduct  that\n\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1).\n\n          The Sentencing Commission's commentary recites a litany\n\nof  illustrative offenses,  including  some that  typically  fall\n\n                                7\n\nwithin  the  reach of  the \"otherwise\"  clause.   See  U.S.S.G.  \n                                                     \n\n4B1.2,  comment (n.2).  Although  larceny from the  person is not\n\nlisted, we do not  think the lack of enumeration  is dispositive.\n\nExpanding  on  the  \"otherwise\"  clause,  the  application  notes\n\nexplain  that  \"[o]ther offenses  are included  where  . .  . the\n\nconduct set forth (i.e., expressly charged) in the count of which\n                       \n\nthe  defendant was  convicted . .  ., by its  nature, presented a\n\nserious potential  risk  of physical  injury  to another.\"    Id.\n                                                                 \n\nAgainst  this backdrop, the lens of judicial inquiry narrows to a\n\ndetermination of whether larceny from the person is a category of\n\ncrime  that,  by  its  nature, presents  a  substantial  risk  of\n\npersonal injury  even though its statutorily  defined elements do\n\nnot include the use or threat of force.\n\n          Appellant  contends that because  the crime potentially\n\nembraces  a  broad  range  of  non-violent  conduct,  see,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nCommonwealth  v. Dimond,  57  Mass. 235,  236-38 (1849)  (holding\n                       \n\nthat, in certain circumstances, fraud can be prosecuted under the\n\nstatute), larceny from  the person cannot be  shoehorned into the\n\ncontours of the \"otherwise\" clause.  We think that Taylor and its\n                                                         \n\nprogeny undermine this contention.   The Taylor Court, invoking a\n                                               \n\ncategorical approach, held that  any state offense containing the\n\nbasic elements  of burglary, \"regardless of  its exact definition\n\nor  label,\"  Taylor,  495  U.S. at  599,  constituted  a \"violent\n                   \n\nfelony\" for  purposes of  sentencing enhancement under  the Armed\n\n                                8\n\nCareer  Criminal Act  (ACCA),  as  amended,  18 U.S.C.     924(e)\n\n(1988).6  Hence, not  only \"especially dangerous\" burglaries, but\n\nalso \"ordinary burglaries,\"  that is, \"run-of-the-mill burglaries\n\ninvolving an unarmed offender, an unoccupied building, and no use\n\nor threat  of force\"  present \"a sufficiently  'serious potential\n\nrisk' to count towards enhancement.\"  Id. at 597.\n                                         \n\n          The linchpin of the taxonomy, then,  is not the breadth\n\nof the statutory sweep but the degree of risk, expressed in terms\n\nof  the probability of physical harm presented by the mine-run of\n\nconduct that falls within the heartland of the statute.  Applying\n\nthis test in  the post-Taylor era, we  have repeatedly classified\n                             \n\nas  crimes of  violence  offenses in  which actual  or threatened\n\nforce  against another  person is  likely, although  by  no means\n\ncertain.  In a case hitting close to the mark, we determined that\n\na conviction  for larceny  from the  person  under Tennessee  law\n\nconstituted  a crime of violence within the meaning of the career\n\noffender guideline.  See United States v. McVicar, 907  F.2d 1, 2\n                                                 \n\n(1st Cir. 1990).   We recognized that, although larceny  from the\n\nperson  \"typically involves no threat of violence,\" id. at 3, the\n                                                       \n\n                    \n\n     6The definition  of \"violent felony\" in  the ACCA's sentence\nenhancement provision is virtually identical to the definition of\n\"crime of violence\" under  U.S.S.G.   4B1.2.  Indeed,  the former\ndefinition  is  widely  regarded  as the  source  of  the  latter\ndefinition.  See Fiore,     F.2d at     n.2 [slip op. at 5  n.2];\n                                       \nUnited  States v.

For that reason, we  have routinely\nheld  that decisions interpreting  the ACCA constitute persuasive\nauthority  upon  which a  court  construing  the career  offender\nguideline may rely.   See Fiore,     F.2d at     n.2 [slip op. at\n                                                \n5 n.2]; Bell, 966 F.2d at 705.\n            \n\n                                9\n\nrisk of ensuing struggle is omnipresent.  Thus, we concluded that\n\n\"[t]aking  property directly  from  a  person  .  .  .  run[s]  a\n\n'substantial'  or  'serious'   risk  that  'physical  force'   or\n\n'physical injury'  will  follow.\"   Id.  at  2.   Of  course,  as\n                                       \n\nappellant points out, the Tennessee  statute at issue in  McVicar\n                                                                 \n\ndiffers  from  the  Massachusetts  statute  in  that  the  former\n\nrequires theft directly from the victim's person.  See 1975 Tenn.\n                                                      \n\nPub. Acts  367,  368.   But,  because the  Massachusetts  statute\n\nrequires theft  from either the  victim's person or  the victim's\n\nimmediate  vicinity,   see  Subilosky,   352  Mass.  at   166,  a\n                                     \n\nsufficiently serious  potential  for confrontation  and  physical\n\ninjury  invariably exists.  Hence, we  believe that the proffered\n\ndistinction  between  the Tennessee  and  Massachusetts statutes,\n\nthough  it exists,  does not  meaningfully differentiate  the two\n\ncases.\n\n          Our other decisions  point in the  same direction.   In\n\nFiore, we  held  that breaking  and  entering into  a  commercial\n     \n\nstructure comprises a crime of violence under the career offender\n\nguideline.    See  Fiore,       F.2d  at       [slip  op.  at  9]\n                        \n\n(concluding  that breaking  into a  commercial building  \"poses a\n\npotential  for episodic violence so substantial  as to bring such\n\nburglaries within the . . . crime of violence ambit\").  In United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Patterson, 882 F.2d 595 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n493 U.S. 1027 (1990), an ACCA case, we held that \"an unauthorized\n\nentry  of the premises of another\" portended a sufficient risk of\n\nharm to  energize the career criminal  statute.  Id. at  604.  If\n                                                    \n\n                                10\n\nbreaking and entering an abandoned warehouse poses a sufficiently\n\n\"serious  potential risk  of physical  injury\" to  trigger career\n\noffender status, we fail to see how larceny  from the person that\n\nnecessarily involves  theft  from within  the victim's  immediate\n\npresence  can be thought to  pose a significantly  lesser risk of\n\nviolent eruption.\n\n          To say more would be to paint the lily.   We rule that,\n\nas the crime of  larceny from the person under  Massachusetts law\n\nbears  an inherent  risk of  violent outbreak,  it constitutes  a\n\ncrime  of  violence within  the  meaning of  the  career offender\n\nprovisions   of  the  federal   sentencing  guidelines.     Thus,\n\nappellant's April 10, 1990 conviction on a charge of larceny from\n\nthe person could properly be counted as a predicate offense.\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We   need  go   no  further.7     Appellant's   larceny\n\nconviction,  taken in  conjunction  with  the earlier  controlled\n\nsubstance offense, comprise  the two predicate offenses  required\n\nfor career offender status.   It follows inexorably, as  night is\n\nsaid  to follow  day,  that appellant  received  his due  in  the\n\ndistrict court.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    \n\n     7Inasmuch as  U.S.S.G.    4B1.1 requires only  two predicate\noffenses as a  condition precedent to its  operation, any attempt\nto evaluate the remaining predicate offense candidates enumerated\nin the PSI Report would be supererogatory.  Therefore, we take no\nview  as  to the  sufficiency  of  those  dispositions under  the\nversion of the career offender guideline applicable to this case.\n\n                                11\n",

In this  appeal, we  consider\n          SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\n                               \n\nwhether larceny from the person is a crime of violence within the\n\nmeaning of the federal sentencing guidelines.  Because  we answer\n\nthat  question  affirmatively, defendant's  prior  conviction for\n\nthat  crime qualifies as  a predicate offense,  requiring that we\n\naffirm his enhanced sentence as a career offender.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The  career offender guideline  elevates the sentencing\n\nrange of  a defendant who, being at  least eighteen years old and\n\nhaving previously  been convicted  of  \"at least  2 prior  felony\n\nconvictions  of  either  a  crime of  violence  or  a  controlled\n\nsubstance offense,\" is found  guilty of a federal felony  that is\n\nitself  either  a crime  of  violence or  a  controlled substance\n\noffense.   U.S.S.G.    4B1.1.1  On January  21, 1992,  defendant-\n\nappellant  Carlos  De  Jesus  pled guilty  to  federal  narcotics\n\noffenses  in  violation of  21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1),  846, 860(a)\n\n(1988)   and  18  U.S.C.      2  (1988).     In  the  presentence\n\ninvestigation   report  (PSI   Report),  the   probation  officer\n\nrecommended that appellant be sentenced as a career offender.  In\n\nsupport  of the  predicate  offense requirement,  the PSI  Report\n\nlimned five prior offenses, viz., a conviction for  possession of\n                                \n\n                    \n\n     1Unless   otherwise  indicated,   all   references  to   the\nsentencing guidelines are to  the November 1991 version.   See 18\n                                                              \nU.S.C.    3553(a)(4)-(5)(1988) (instructing a sentencing court to\nconsider the guidelines and  policy statements \"in effect on  the\ndate  the defendant  is sentenced\");  see also  United States  v.\n                                                             \nHarotunian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1041-42 (1st Cir.  1990) (explaining\n          \nthat, save for any  ex post facto complications, \"a  defendant is\n                                 \nto  be punished according to the guidelines in effect at the time\nof sentencing\").\n\n                                3\n\nheroin with  intent to distribute, two  diversionary dispositions\n\nfor  assault and  battery  that were  placed  on file  without  a\n\nfinding  of guilt,  a  diversionary disposition  for assault  and\n\nbattery  that was placed on file after  a finding of guilt, and a\n\nconviction for larceny from the person.2 \n\n          At sentencing,  the  district  court  adopted  the  PSI\n\nReport's recommendation, branded appellant a career offender, and\n\nset  the guideline  sentencing  range (GSR)  at 210-262  months.3\n\nThe  court then  granted a  government motion  filed pursuant  to\n\nU.S.S.G.   5K1.1 and departed downward in tribute to  appellant's\n\nsubstantial  assistance, sentencing  him  to a  60-month term  of\n\nincarceration.\n\n          Appellant objects  to his  classification  as a  career\n\noffender.   He  acknowledges that  his conviction  for possessing\n\nheroin  with  intent  to  distribute  is  a  countable  predicate\n\noffense, but  protests that there is  no other.  Thus,  he claims\n\nthat  the  government  failed  to  show  the  requisite  pair  of\n\npredicate offenses.\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          Although the lower court determined that De Jesus was a\n\ncareer offender, it  made no express finding  as to which  of his\n\npast escapades constituted predicate  offenses within the meaning\n\n                    \n\n     2The first three dispositions occurred on November 24, 1987;\nthe last two  dispositions occurred on April 10, 1990.   All five\ncases were prosecuted in a Massachusetts state court.\n\n     3Both sides  agree that, apart from  career offender status,\nthe GSR would have been 46-57 months.\n\n                                4\n\nof U.S.S.G.   4B1.1.   Because appellant admits the  incidence of\n\none  predicate offense (for peddling heroin), our sole task is to\n\ndetermine  whether  the record  supports  the  sentencing court's\n\nimplicit finding  of a  second predicate  offense.4  We  approach\n\nthis task with an awareness that, so long as any one of the other\n\ndispositions  catalogued in  the PSI  Report qualifies  under the\n\ncareer offender rubric, De Jesus's appeal founders.\n\n                                A\n\n          Because we  believe it is relatively  clearcut, we turn\n\nfirst to the issue of whether appellant's conviction for  larceny\n\nfrom  the  person constitutes  a  predicate  offense.   Appellant\n\nclaims that this conviction cannot trigger career offender status\n\nbecause the crime charged,  a violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266,\n\n   25(b) (1990), does not  constitute a crime  of violence within\n\nthe meaning of the sentencing guidelines.  We do not agree.\n\n          The  Sentencing  Commission  has  defined  a  crime  of\n\nviolence as a federal or state offense punishable by imprisonment\n\nfor more than one year that:\n\n          (i)   has  as an  element the  use, attempted\n          use,  or  threatened  use of  physical  force\n          against the  person of  another,  or (ii)  is\n          burglary  of a dwelling, arson, or extortion,\n\n                    \n\n     4Although  the lack  of express  findings is  a complicating\nfactor, it does not  frustrate appellate review.  After  all, the\nquestion of whether a crime qualifies as a predicate offense is a\nquestion of  law and, hence, our  review is plenary.   See United\n                                                                 \nStates v. Fiore,      F.2d    ,     (1st Cir. 1992) [No. 92-1601,\n                                   \nslip  op. at 3].   Therefore, this  appeal can proceed.   We take\nthis opportunity, however, to emphasize that  reasonably complete\nfindings  at  the trial  court  level  invariably facilitate  the\nappellate  task and to urge district judges to make such findings\nwherever possible.\n\n                                5\n\n          involves  use  of  explosives,  or  otherwise\n          involves  conduct  that  presents  a  serious\n          potential risk of physical injury to another.\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1).  A formal categorical approach   an approach\n\nthat looks to  a prior offense's statutory provenance rather than\n\nto its  actual facts    is the  method of choice  for determining\n\nwhether a  felony constitutes a targeted crime within the meaning\n\nof this definition.

The puzzle,\n\nhowever,  is not  so  easily solved;  even  if force  (actual  or\n\nthreatened) is  not an element of the  offense, a crime may still\n\nbe a crime  of violence if it falls within the \"otherwise\" clause\n\nof  subsection  (ii), that  is,  if  it  \"involves  conduct  that\n\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1).\n\n          The Sentencing Commission's commentary recites a litany\n\nof  illustrative offenses,  including  some that  typically  fall\n\n                                7\n\nwithin  the  reach of  the \"otherwise\"  clause.   See  U.S.S.G.  \n                                                     \n\n4B1.2,  comment (n.2).  Although  larceny from the  person is not\n\nlisted, we do not  think the lack of enumeration  is dispositive.\n\nExpanding  on  the  \"otherwise\"  clause,  the  application  notes\n\nexplain  that  \"[o]ther offenses  are included  where  . .  . the\n\nconduct set forth (i.e., expressly charged) in the count of which\n                       \n\nthe  defendant was  convicted . .  ., by its  nature, presented a\n\nserious potential  risk  of physical  injury  to another.\"    Id.\n                                                                 \n\nAgainst  this backdrop, the lens of judicial inquiry narrows to a\n\ndetermination of whether larceny from the person is a category of\n\ncrime  that,  by  its  nature, presents  a  substantial  risk  of\n\npersonal injury  even though its statutorily  defined elements do\n\nnot include the use or threat of force.\n\n          Appellant  contends that because  the crime potentially\n\nembraces  a  broad  range  of  non-violent  conduct,  see,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nCommonwealth  v. Dimond,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  236-38 (1849)  (holding\n                       \n\nthat, in certain circumstances, fraud can be prosecuted under the\n\nstatute), larceny from  the person cannot be  shoehorned into the\n\ncontours of the \"otherwise\" clause.  We think that Taylor and its\n                                                         \n\nprogeny undermine this contention.   The Taylor Court, invoking a\n                                               \n\ncategorical approach, held that  any state offense containing the\n\nbasic elements  of burglary, \"regardless of  its exact definition\n\nor  label,\"  Taylor,  495  U.S. at  599,  constituted  a \"violent\n                   \n\nfelony\" for  purposes of  sentencing enhancement under  the Armed\n\n                                8\n\nCareer  Criminal Act  (ACCA),  as  amended,  18 U.S.C.     924(e)\n\n(1988).6  Hence, not  only \"especially dangerous\" burglaries, but\n\nalso \"ordinary burglaries,\"  that is, \"run-of-the-mill burglaries\n\ninvolving an unarmed offender, an unoccupied building, and no use\n\nor threat  of force\"  present \"a sufficiently  'serious potential\n\nrisk' to count towards enhancement.\"  Id. at 597.\n                                         \n\n          The linchpin of the taxonomy, then,  is not the breadth\n\nof the statutory sweep but the degree of risk, expressed in terms\n\nof  the probability of physical harm presented by the mine-run of\n\nconduct that falls within the heartland of the statute.  Applying\n\nthis test in  the post-Taylor era, we  have repeatedly classified\n                             \n\nas  crimes of  violence  offenses in  which actual  or threatened\n\nforce  against another  person is  likely, although  by  no means\n\ncertain.  In a case hitting close to the mark, we determined that\n\na conviction  for larceny  from the  person  under Tennessee  law\n\nconstituted  a crime of violence within the meaning of the career\n\noffender guideline.  See United States v. McVicar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543830\"><a href=\"/opinion/543830/united-states-v-louis-mcvicar/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2\n                                                 \n\n(1st Cir. 1990).   We recognized that, although larceny  from the\n\nperson  \"typically involves no threat of violence,\" id. at 3, the\n                                                       \n\n                    \n\n     6The definition  of \"violent felony\" in  the ACCA's sentence\nenhancement provision is virtually identical to the definition of\n\"crime of violence\" under  U.S.S.G.   4B1.2.  Indeed,  the former\ndefinition  is  widely  regarded  as the  source  of  the  latter\ndefinition.  See Fiore,     F.2d at     n.2 [slip op. at 5  n.2];\n                                       \nUnited  States v.

For that reason, we  have routinely\nheld  that decisions interpreting  the ACCA constitute persuasive\nauthority  upon  which a  court  construing  the career  offender\nguideline may rely.   See Fiore,     F.2d at     n.2 [slip op. at\n                                                \n5 n.2]; Bell, 966 F.2d at 705.\n            \n\n                                9\n\nrisk of ensuing struggle is omnipresent.  Thus, we concluded that\n\n\"[t]aking  property directly  from  a  person  .  .  .  run[s]  a\n\n'substantial'  or  'serious'   risk  that  'physical  force'   or\n\n'physical injury'  will  follow.\"   Id.  at  2.   Of  course,  as\n                                       \n\nappellant points out, the Tennessee  statute at issue in  McVicar\n                                                                 \n\ndiffers  from  the  Massachusetts  statute  in  that  the  former\n\nrequires theft directly from the victim's person.  See 1975 Tenn.\n                                                      \n\nPub. Acts  367,  368.   But,  because the  Massachusetts  statute\n\nrequires theft  from either the  victim's person or  the victim's\n\nimmediate  vicinity,   see  Subilosky,   352  Mass.  at   166,  a\n                                     \n\nsufficiently serious  potential  for confrontation  and  physical\n\ninjury  invariably exists.  Hence, we  believe that the proffered\n\ndistinction  between  the Tennessee  and  Massachusetts statutes,\n\nthough  it exists,  does not  meaningfully differentiate  the two\n\ncases.\n\n          Our other decisions  point in the  same direction.   In\n\nFiore, we  held  that breaking  and  entering into  a  commercial\n     \n\nstructure comprises a crime of violence under the career offender\n\nguideline.    See  Fiore,       F.2d  at       [slip  op.  at  9]\n                        \n\n(concluding  that breaking  into a  commercial building  \"poses a\n\npotential  for episodic violence so substantial  as to bring such\n\nburglaries within the . . . crime of violence ambit\").  In United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

Id. at  604.  If\n                                                    \n\n                                10\n\nbreaking and entering an abandoned warehouse poses a sufficiently\n\n\"serious  potential risk  of physical  injury\" to  trigger career\n\noffender status, we fail to see how larceny  from the person that\n\nnecessarily involves  theft  from within  the victim's  immediate\n\npresence  can be thought to  pose a significantly  lesser risk of\n\nviolent eruption.\n\n          To say more would be to paint the lily.   We rule that,\n\nas the crime of  larceny from the person under  Massachusetts law\n\nbears  an inherent  risk of  violent outbreak,  it constitutes  a\n\ncrime  of  violence within  the  meaning of  the  career offender\n\nprovisions   of  the  federal   sentencing  guidelines.     Thus,\n\nappellant's April 10, 1990 conviction on a charge of larceny from\n\nthe person could properly be counted as a predicate offense.\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We   need  go   no  further.7     Appellant's   larceny\n\nconviction,  taken in  conjunction  with  the earlier  controlled\n\nsubstance offense, comprise  the two predicate offenses  required\n\nfor career offender status.   It follows inexorably, as  night is\n\nsaid  to follow  day,  that appellant  received  his due  in  the\n\ndistrict court.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    \n\n     7Inasmuch as  U.S.S.G.    4B1.1 requires only  two predicate\noffenses as a  condition precedent to its  operation, any attempt\nto evaluate the remaining predicate offense candidates enumerated\nin the PSI Report would be supererogatory.  Therefore, we take no\nview  as  to the  sufficiency  of  those  dispositions under  the\nversion of the career offender guideline applicable to this case.\n\n                                11\n</pre>",
