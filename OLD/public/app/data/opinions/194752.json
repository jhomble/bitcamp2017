Delaware, 438 U.S. 154\n                                                   \n(1978), the court also received evidence concerning Carty's post-\narrest statements to the police.\n\n     2The Cardarelli affidavit stated in pertinent part:\n\n               Within the  past few days . . . my reli-\n          able and confidential informant  . . . stated\n          . . . that Ralph and Pamela [Carty] are stor-\n          ing  and  selling   illegal  [c]ocaine   from\n          [their] house located at 34 Adelaide Ave. 1st\n          floor  apartment,  garage  area and  basement\n          area, Providence, RI. . . .\n\nJuly 30, 1990, indicated that the controlled buy had taken  place\n\nwithin the preceding \"few  days,\" Cardarelli subsequently learned\n\nthat Carty and his family  were on vacation during that time  and\n\nhad not returned to their residence until the evening of July 29.\n\nAt the  suppression hearing,  Cardarelli testified that  the con-\n\n                    \n\n               Within the past few days  this confiden-\n          tial informant  . . . agreed  to make a  pur-\n          chase of cocaine from  Ralph H. Carty from 34\n          Adelaide Ave.  first floor  apartment. .  . .\n          [A]ffiant met this  informant at [a]  pre-ar-\n          ranged  location  [where]  the informant  was\n          searched by your affiant and after finding no\n          contraband the informant  was given a sum  of\n          U.S. currency  for the purpose  of purchasing\n          suspected cocaine  from  the Ralph  H.  Carty\n          subject at 34 Adelaide  Ave.  [T]he informant\n          was driven into the  area of 34 Adelaide Ave-\n          nue and . . . was then observed by your affi-\n          ant walking over to 34 Adelaide Avenue. . . .\n          [T]he informant was  observed knocking on the\n          front door  . . . and then . . . entered this\n          location.   A short  time later the informant\n          was . . . observed . . .  walking back to our\n          pre-arranged location.  Never losing sight of\n          this  informant[,] the informant met your af-\n          fiant   back   at   the  pre-arranged   loca-\n          tion. . . .   [A]t  this time  the  informant\n          handed over to your affiant a bag of suspect-\n          ed  cocaine. . . .   [A]  field   test  . . .\n          proved positive. . . .\n               . . . [T]he informant who  has purchased\n          cocaine  several times  from either  Ralph or\n          Pamela  Carty  stated  to  your  affiant that\n          cocaine was being  stored in the garage  area\n          and  in the  basement area.    This informant\n          purchased cocaine from Ralph on  one occasion\n          when the informant observed Ralph go into the\n          basement  area  and came  up  with  a bag  of\n          cocaine.   On another  occasion the informant\n          observed  Ralph go  into the garage  area and\n          return with a  bag of  cocaine. . . .   [T]he\n          informant stated that Ralph hides the cocaine\n          in  different areas of  his house  and garage\n          areas so that the police will not be  able to\n          find the  large quantity of  cocaine if  they\n          . . . raid the house.\n\n                                3\n\ntrolled buy took place between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m. on July 30.  He\n                                                    \n\nexplained that it was  normal police procedure not to  reveal the\n\nexact date of the controlled buy so as to protect the identity of\n\nthe confidential  informant.  Cardarelli testified  that he drove\n\nthe  informant to the tenement  in which Carty  occupied a first-\n\nfloor apartment, observed the  informant enter and emerge shortly\n\nthereafter  with  a  small  baggie containing  a  substance  that\n\nappeared  to be  cocaine, returned  to the  Special Investigation\n\nBureau (\"SIB\") office,  and performed  a field test  on the  sub-\n\nstance.  As  the test  indicated the presence  of cocaine,  Card-\n\narelli drafted the affidavit and obtained a search warrant from a\n\nstate court  judge.    At  approximately 8:00  p.m.  on  July 30,\n\nCardarelli and other  officers executed the search warrant at the\n\nCarty residence.\n\n          Detective Stephen  Berarducci corroborated Cardarelli's\n\ntestimony.  He testified that he saw Cardarelli at the SIB office\n\non  July 30 at about 2:00 p.m.  and was aware that Cardarelli was\n\ngoing  to  attempt  a  controlled buy  at  the  Carty  residence.\n\nAccording to Berarducci, Cardarelli returned to the office around\n\n4:00 p.m.  and performed a field  test on a small  plastic bag of\n\ncocaine, which  Cardarelli said had  been purchased at  the Carty\n\nresidence.  Berarducci  also testified that  he received a  check\n\nthe following day from Sergeant Dennis Lambert,  the SIB evidence\n\ncontrol  officer,  which  was used  to  pay  for  the informant's\n\nservices.  A photocopy of the check was admitted into evidence.\n\n          Sergeant Lambert testified that he could locate neither\n\n                                4\n\na log book entry, nor a \"controlled buy form,\" reflecting a  drug\n\ntransaction on July  30 conducted by Detective  Cardarelli or any\n\nother officer.3  Lambert testified that his records  documented a\n\ncontrolled  buy of  heroin  on July  25  or 26  at  the apartment\n                          \n\nbuilding in which Carty lived, but that it occurred on the second\n                                                                 \n\nfloor of the building and was unrelated to any  controlled buy at\n     \n\nthe Carty apartment on the first floor.\n\n          Two of Carty's co-workers testified that he was at work\n\non July 30  between 9:00 a.m. and 7:00  p.m.  Mrs. Carty provided\n\nsimilar testimony and submitted receipts reflecting Carty's wages\n\nfor  the day.   She further testified  that no one  came to their\n\nresidence between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. on July 30.  Two  other\n\nindividuals  testified  that they  were  at  the Carty  residence\n\nthroughout the day on July 30  and that no one came to  the house\n\nbetween 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.\n\n          At  the  conclusion  of the  suppression  hearing,  the\n\ndistrict court declined to  suppress the evidence seized pursuant\n\n                    \n\n     3Sergeant  Lambert described  the  procedure used  after  an\ninvestigating officer has directed an informant to purchase drugs\nwith police  funds:  The  investigating officer performs  a field\ntest  on the drugs, then fills out a controlled buy form reflect-\ning the date  and location of the  controlled buy, the  number of\nthe  check used  to finance  the purchase,  a description  of the\nitems  purchased, and the name of the investigating officer.  The\nofficer  attaches the controlled buy form to the drugs, and drops\nthe narcotics (controlled buy form attached) through  a slot into\na  safe.   The officer logs  on the  control sheet  the amount of\nmoney spent  on the drugs.   Lambert transcribes  the information\nfrom the control sheets into  a log book each week.   Every month\nor so, he opens  the safe containing the narcotics,  compares the\ncontrolled  buy form attached to  each bag of  narcotics with the\nlog book, removes and retains the form, and delivers the drugs to\nthe state health department for destruction.\n\n                                5\n\nto the warrant as Carty had failed to produce sufficient evidence\n\nto undermine the  Cardarelli affidavit.4  Carty  contends that he\n\n                    \n\n     4The district court explained its findings as follows:\n\n               Now, turning to  the contention that the\n          allegations in the warrant are willful false-\n          hood[s], I must say  this is a bold assertion\n          but  nevertheless  tinged  with a  degree  of\n          suspicion as  to  the accuracy  of  Detective\n          Cardarelli's testimony.  However,  the suspi-\n          cion is not evidence and certainly not strong\n          enough to destroy credibility sufficiently to\n          declare the search illegal.\n               . . .  It is  strange  indeed [that]  no\n          [record of the  controlled buy] could  be lo-\n          cated.  This  would have clearly  established\n          the date of the purchase. . . .\n               The detective asserts the buy  was defi-\n          nitely made on the 30th.  The affidavit indi-\n          cates it  was made  within the past  few days\n          . . .  of the 30th.  I agree the semantics of\n          the  affidavit lead to an interpretation that\n          the buy was made prior to the 30th.\n               However,  the   officer  explained  that\n          preciseness of dates was purposefully avoided\n          when  controlled buys  are made  in order  to\n          safeguard the identity of the informant and I\n          am constrained to accept this.\n               . . . [W]hether or  not Ralph Carty made\n          the   alleged  sale   to  the   informant  on\n          September 30  [sic] really isn't a vital fact\n          to  be  resolved in  order  to  rule on  this\n          motion.  The affidavit premising the issuance\n          of the search warrant did not turn on a  pur-\n          chase  being made  strictly from  Ralph Carty\n          nor does  it say  it was purchased  from him.\n          The crucial fact in the affidavit [is] that a\n          purchase  was made  from  Adelaide Avenue  on\n          September 30 [sic].\n               I  can  understand  [defense  counsel's]\n          argument here but it would be asking too much\n          of  the  Court  to  conclude  that  Detective\n          Cardarelli  is a bold-face perjurer, not only\n          in this courtroom but was at the time that he\n          made the  affidavit and  at the time  that he\n          presented  it to  the  State  District  Court\n          Judge for  the issuance of the  warrant.  And\n          so I  feel constrained  and I do  hereby deny\n          the [suppression] motions. . . .\n\n                                6\n\ndemonstrated that  the controlled buy could not  have occurred as\n\ndescribed in the Cardarelli affidavit.   Without the false state-\n\nments,  he argues,  the affidavit  was insufficient  to establish\n\nprobable  cause.  See Franks,  438 U.S. at  156 (If the defendant\n                            \n\nproves perjury or \"reckless disregard,\" by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, and  the untainted content of the affidavit is insuffi-\n\ncient  to establish probable cause, the fruits of the search must\n\nbe excluded \"to the same extent  as if probable cause was lacking\n\non the face of the affidavit.\").\n\n          We  review the  district court's  findings of  fact for\n\nclear error; its  conclusion of law  de novo.   United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nGarcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1167 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Sanchez,  943 F.2d 110, 112  (1st Cir. 1991)).   Its denial of\n          \n\nthe suppression motion will be upheld if supported by any reason-\n\nable view of the evidence.  Id.\n                              \n\n          Although  we find  it  troubling, as  did the  district\n\ncourt, that there is no record of a controlled cocaine buy during\n\nthe entire relevant period, our review of the suppression hearing\n\ntranscript reveals nothing inherently contradictory or incredible\n\nin  Cardarelli's   testimony,   as  corroborated   by   Detective\n\nBerarducci.  First and foremost, Cardarelli's suppression hearing\n\ntestimony as to the exact date of the controlled buy (July 30) is\n\nnot inconsistent  with  the time  period  (\"within the  past  few\n\ndays\") he gave in the warrant  affidavit; July 30 at 2:00 to 4:00\n\np.m. was \"within the  past few days\" of  Cardarelli's preparation\n        \n\nof the warrant affidavit, which occurred late in the afternoon or\n\n                                7\n\nearly in the  evening of July  30.  Thus,  the affidavit was  not\n\nnecessarily  inconsistent with  Cardarelli's testimony.   Second,\n\nthe district court, before  whom Cardarelli and Berarducci testi-\n\nfied, credited Cardarelli's explanation  that it was customary to\n\navoid  precise specification of  the dates of  controlled buys in\n\norder  to protect  the identity  of informants.   Finding nothing\n\ninherently inconsistent in Cardarelli's testimony, and mindful of\n\nthe trial court's  superior vantage point, we are  satisfied that\n\nthere is  no sound  basis for second-guessing  its demeanor-based\n\ncredibility  determinations  at the  suppression  hearing.5   See\n                                                                 \n\nWainwright v. Witt,  469 U.S. 412, 428  (1985) (determinations of\n                  \n\ndemeanor and  credibility are  peculiarly within a  trial judge's\n\nprovince); United States v. Portalla, 985 F.2d 621, 622 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1993)  (recognizing  district  court's broad  power  to determine\n\nwitness  credibility); see  also Anderson  v. Bessemer  City, 470\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  564, 575 (1985) (\"only the trial  judge can be aware of the\n\nvariations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear  so heavily on\n\nthe listener's understanding of and belief in what is said\").6\n\n                    \n\n     5Contrary to Carty's contention,  we find no indication that\nthe district  court imposed  a more  stringent standard  of proof\nthan  the  applicable \"preponderance  of the  evidence\" standard.\nSee Franks, 438 U.S. at 156.  \n          \n\n     6Appellant  claims  that the  Cardarelli  affidavit includes\nstatements made  with reckless disregard  for their truth,  as it\ngave the erroneous impression  that Carty personally sold cocaine\nto the informant.  We need not address the merits  of this claim.\nAs the  district court correctly  noted, Carty's presence  at the\ntime the undercover buy occurred was immaterial to the establish-\nment  of probable  cause  to search  the  residence.   Since  the\naffidavit provided  probable cause to believe  that the informant\npurchased cocaine at  the Carty residence, without regard  to the\n                                         \nidentity of the  seller, the district  court properly denied  the\n\n                                8\n\n     2.   Right to Confrontation\n                                \n\n          Carty next  asserts that  his Sixth Amendment  right to\n\nconfront adverse witnesses was  infringed by the district court's\n\nrestrictions on cross-examination of Detective Cardarelli  at the\n\nsuppression hearing.  In the course of cross-examining Cardarelli\n\nabout  the perceived  discrepancy between  his testimony  and his\n\naffidavit relating to  the date  of the  controlled buy,  defense\n\ncounsel  inquired:  \"Tell  me, Detective Cardarelli,  why are you\n\nrepresented  by Mr.  Bevilacqua?\"   When  the  court refused,  on\n\nrelevancy  grounds,  to  direct  Cardarelli to  answer  over  the\n\ngovernment's objection,  defense counsel  responded by way  of an\n\noffer of  proof:  \"[I]t is  my belief that this  witness is being\n\ninvestigated for corruption  in the police department.\"   Defense\n\ncounsel  hypothesized  that  Cardarelli  may  have  adjusted  the\n\nasserted  date of  the  controlled buy  to  negate Carty's  alibi\n\nevidence.  Counsel argued  that the proposed line  of questioning\n\nwas  intended to  determine  whether Cardarelli  was telling  the\n\ntruth.   Rebuffed by the  district court,7 defense  counsel urged\n\n                    \n\nmotion to suppress.

I think you are entitled\n     to it.   You have  cross-examined him vigorously  as to\n     the date of the purchase.  He has maintained that a buy\n     was made on  the 30th.   There is no  question how  the\n     affidavit  reads.  It's for me to decide whether that's\n     inconsistent with the affidavit.  Now, the fact that he\n\n                                9\n\nthat he  be permitted to show Cardarelli's  bias, suggesting that\n\n\"if, in fact, the investigation  is being conducted . . .  by the\n\n[f]ederal  [g]overnment,  then [Cardarelli]  has  an  interest in\n\nmaking the [f]ederal  [g]overnment happy by  being a witness  who\n\ntestifies  consistently with  the  [g]overnment's theory  of this\n\ncase[, a]nd bias to that extent is a legitimate area of inquiry.\"\n\nConcluding  that it  was not  \"material to  the issue  here,\" the\n\ncourt  remained steadfast in  its refusal to  permit inquiry con-\n\ncerning the supposed investigation.\n\n          Carty contends that  the proffer demonstrated that  the\n\nputative federal investigation into possible corruption involving\n\nCardarelli was directly  related to  the events in  the case  and\n\nprobative of Cardarelli's  credibility and bias,  and, therefore,\n\nthat  the  district  court's  ruling deprived  him  of  his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to confrontation.   \"[A] primary interest secured\n\nby [the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment] is the right\n\nof cross-examination.\"   Douglas  v.

The court  recognized that  the conclusory  offer of\n\nproof  simply  speculated  that an  investigation  into  possible\n\npolice corruption might be underway and might involve Cardarelli.\n\nThere was no indication as  to the source or basis of  the stated\n\nbelief, no substantiation, and no representation that the federal\n\ngovernment was involved in any such investigation.  Nor was there\n\nany  suggestion that  the  supposed investigation  in any  manner\n\nrelated to the  events at issue in this case.   Thus, the conten-\n\ntion,  advanced  below and  on appeal,  that Cardarelli  may have\n\ntestified with a view to impressing the federal government is not\n\neven  based on  a speculative  belief.   Absent any  such logical\n\nlinkage, the proposed  inquiry was irrelevant,  just as the  dis-\n\ntrict court found.  Moreover, as the district court was  also the\n\nfinder of fact  at the  suppression hearing, the  defense was  on\n\nnotice  that it  needed  to make  the  strongest offer  of  proof\n\npossible to overcome the government's  objection to this line  of\n\ninquiry.  Yet the  offer of proof was left (and remains) patently\n\ndeficient to enable the conclusion that the district court abused\n\nits  discretion  by  ruling  the proffer  inadequate  to  warrant\n\n                                12\n\nfurther  inquiry over  the  government's objection.

At  trial, Detective\n\nCardarelli testified as follows:\n\n          Mr.  Carty stated  to me that  he also  had a\n          location on  Route 95  in Attleboro  where he\n          would drive  his white  Camaro to meet  a so-\n          called person, he didn't mention  any name or\n          didn't give any description,  at a road  side\n          rest  stop where this  person would  meet him\n          and  leave drugs underneath a trash container\n          at that  roadside stop and  he would retrieve\n          the drugs and bring them back to  the City of\n          Providence.  And I then asked him why did you\n          go through  all that  trouble?  And  he says,\n          because  this person  does not  want  to come\n          into the City of Providence because there's a\n          lot  of heat on drug activity  in the City of\n          Providence.\n\n                                13\n\nAnother police officer testified  that he overheard the conversa-\n\ntion,  and  corroborated  Cardarelli's  testimony.    When  asked\n\nwhether Carty described what he was buying, the  officer replied,\n\n\"coke.\"\n\n          Admissible  \"other act\" evidence  must survive scrutiny\n\nunder  Rules 403 and 404(b).   First, under the \"absolute bar\" of\n\nRule 404(b), the evidence  is inadmissible if relevant  solely to\n\nshow the  defendant's character  or propensity for  criminal con-\n\nduct; it must have  some \"special relevance\" to a  material issue\n\nsuch  as  motive,  opportunity,  intent,  preparation,  plan,  or\n\nknowledge.  See United States v. Agudelo,      F.2d    ,     (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1993), No.  90-1465, slip  op.  at 4-5  (1st Cir.  Mar. 18,\n\n1993);  United States  v.

Second,  under Rule  403, the  trial court  must satisfy\n\nitself that the probative  value of the evidence is  not substan-\n\ntially outweighed  by the danger of  unfair prejudice, confusion,\n\nor undue  delay.

Appellant has not shown that the probative value of\n\nthe  \"other act\"  evidence  was substantially  outweighed by  its\n\nunfair prejudice.   See Onujiogu v. United States, 817  F.2d 3, 6\n                                                 \n\n(1st Cir.  1987) (\"The  fact  that a  piece of  evidence hurts  a\n\nparty's chances does not mean it should automatically be  exclud-\n\ned,  [or]  there would  be  precious little  left in  the  way of\n\nprobative evidence in any case\").  As Carty's  post-arrest state-\n\nments relating to a  cocaine source were probative of  his intent\n\nand opportunity to possess and distribute cocaine, see supra Part\n                                                            \n\nI.B.1.a., and  there was no  \"unfair prejudice,\"8 Rule  403 posed\n\nno barrier to their admission in evidence.9\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     8Although  Carty  suggests  that  the  \"slightest prejudice\"\nresulting  from improper  admission of  the \"other  act\" evidence\nmight  have caused the jury  to disbelieve a  defense witness who\ntestified that  he, rather than  Carty, owned the  weapons seized\nfrom  the  Carty residence,  we are  hard-pressed to  discern any\n                                                                 \nharm.  Since  the jury acquitted Carty  on the cocaine  charge to\nwhich the \"other  act\" evidence related, we consider  the sugges-\ntion far-fetched.\n\n     9Finally,  Carty argues that  the court erred  by not giving\nlimiting instructions to the  jury either contemporaneously or in\nits charge.   Carty waived  the objection by  requesting neither.\nSee Fed.  R. Crim. P. 30 &amp; 52(b).   Moreover, as we are confident\n   \nthat the lack of limiting instructions  did not \"seriously affect\nthe fundamental fairness and basic integrity of the proceedings,\"\nthere was no plain error.  See United States v.

I  disagree with my\n\ncolleagues in  the majority  that it  is \"far-fetched\"  that this\n\nevidence influenced the jury in any way because Carty was acquit-\n\nted  of  the cocaine  charge.

As  such a\n\nnefarious person, the jury could very well have believed that the\n\nfirearms were his  tools of  the trade.   The improper  character\n\nevidence easily could  have carried the  day for the  Government,\n\nconsidering  the  highly contradictory  nature  of  the proof  it\n\npresented.  Ante, at 3-5.

Carty\n          subject at 34 Adelaide  Ave.  [T]he informant\n          was driven into the  area of 34 Adelaide Ave-\n          nue and . . . was then observed by your affi-\n          ant walking over to 34 Adelaide Avenue. . . .\n          [T]he informant was  observed knocking on the\n          front door  . . . and then . . . entered this\n          location.   A short  time later the informant\n          was . . . observed . . .  walking back to our\n          pre-arranged location.  Never losing sight of\n          this  informant[,] the informant met your af-\n          fiant   back   at   the  pre-arranged   loca-\n          tion. . . .   [A]t  this time  the  informant\n          handed over to your affiant a bag of suspect-\n          ed  cocaine. . . .   [A]  field   test  . . .\n          proved positive. . . .\n               . . . [T]he informant who  has purchased\n          cocaine  several times  from either  Ralph or\n          Pamela  Carty  stated  to  your  affiant that\n          cocaine was being  stored in the garage  area\n          and  in the  basement area.    This informant\n          purchased cocaine from Ralph on  one occasion\n          when the informant observed Ralph go into the\n          basement  area  and came  up  with  a bag  of\n          cocaine.   On another  occasion the informant\n          observed  Ralph go  into the garage  area and\n          return with a  bag of  cocaine. . . .   [T]he\n          informant stated that Ralph hides the cocaine\n          in  different areas of  his house  and garage\n          areas so that the police will not be  able to\n          find the  large quantity of  cocaine if  they\n          . . . raid the house.\n\n                                3\n\ntrolled buy took place between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m. on July 30.  He\n                                                    \n\nexplained that it was  normal police procedure not to  reveal the\n\nexact date of the controlled buy so as to protect the identity of\n\nthe confidential  informant.  Cardarelli testified  that he drove\n\nthe  informant to the tenement  in which Carty  occupied a first-\n\nfloor apartment, observed the  informant enter and emerge shortly\n\nthereafter  with  a  small  baggie containing  a  substance  that\n\nappeared  to be  cocaine, returned  to the  Special Investigation\n\nBureau (\"SIB\") office,  and performed  a field test  on the  sub-\n\nstance.  As  the test  indicated the presence  of cocaine,  Card-\n\narelli drafted the affidavit and obtained a search warrant from a\n\nstate court  judge.    At  approximately 8:00  p.m.  on  July 30,\n\nCardarelli and other  officers executed the search warrant at the\n\nCarty residence.\n\n          Detective Stephen  Berarducci corroborated Cardarelli's\n\ntestimony.  He testified that he saw Cardarelli at the SIB office\n\non  July 30 at about 2:00 p.m.  and was aware that Cardarelli was\n\ngoing  to  attempt  a  controlled buy  at  the  Carty  residence.\n\nAccording to Berarducci, Cardarelli returned to the office around\n\n4:00 p.m.  and performed a field  test on a small  plastic bag of\n\ncocaine, which  Cardarelli said had  been purchased at  the Carty\n\nresidence.  Berarducci  also testified that  he received a  check\n\nthe following day from Sergeant Dennis Lambert,  the SIB evidence\n\ncontrol  officer,  which  was used  to  pay  for  the informant's\n\nservices.  A photocopy of the check was admitted into evidence.\n\n          Sergeant Lambert testified that he could locate neither\n\n                                4\n\na log book entry, nor a \"controlled buy form,\" reflecting a  drug\n\ntransaction on July  30 conducted by Detective  Cardarelli or any\n\nother officer.3  Lambert testified that his records  documented a\n\ncontrolled  buy of  heroin  on July  25  or 26  at  the apartment\n                          \n\nbuilding in which Carty lived, but that it occurred on the second\n                                                                 \n\nfloor of the building and was unrelated to any  controlled buy at\n     \n\nthe Carty apartment on the first floor.\n\n          Two of Carty's co-workers testified that he was at work\n\non July 30  between 9:00 a.m. and 7:00  p.m.  Mrs. Carty provided\n\nsimilar testimony and submitted receipts reflecting Carty's wages\n\nfor  the day.   She further testified  that no one  came to their\n\nresidence between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. on July 30.  Two  other\n\nindividuals  testified  that they  were  at  the Carty  residence\n\nthroughout the day on July 30  and that no one came to  the house\n\nbetween 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.\n\n          At  the  conclusion  of the  suppression  hearing,  the\n\ndistrict court declined to  suppress the evidence seized pursuant\n\n                    \n\n     3Sergeant  Lambert described  the  procedure used  after  an\ninvestigating officer has directed an informant to purchase drugs\nwith police  funds:  The  investigating officer performs  a field\ntest  on the drugs, then fills out a controlled buy form reflect-\ning the date  and location of the  controlled buy, the  number of\nthe  check used  to finance  the purchase,  a description  of the\nitems  purchased, and the name of the investigating officer.  The\nofficer  attaches the controlled buy form to the drugs, and drops\nthe narcotics (controlled buy form attached) through  a slot into\na  safe.   The officer logs  on the  control sheet  the amount of\nmoney spent  on the drugs.   Lambert transcribes  the information\nfrom the control sheets into  a log book each week.   Every month\nor so, he opens  the safe containing the narcotics,  compares the\ncontrolled  buy form attached to  each bag of  narcotics with the\nlog book, removes and retains the form, and delivers the drugs to\nthe state health department for destruction.\n\n                                5\n\nto the warrant as Carty had failed to produce sufficient evidence\n\nto undermine the  Cardarelli affidavit.4  Carty  contends that he\n\n                    \n\n     4The district court explained its findings as follows:\n\n               Now, turning to  the contention that the\n          allegations in the warrant are willful false-\n          hood[s], I must say  this is a bold assertion\n          but  nevertheless  tinged  with a  degree  of\n          suspicion as  to  the accuracy  of  Detective\n          Cardarelli's testimony.  However,  the suspi-\n          cion is not evidence and certainly not strong\n          enough to destroy credibility sufficiently to\n          declare the search illegal.\n               . . .  It is  strange  indeed [that]  no\n          [record of the  controlled buy] could  be lo-\n          cated.  This  would have clearly  established\n          the date of the purchase. . . .\n               The detective asserts the buy  was defi-\n          nitely made on the 30th.  The affidavit indi-\n          cates it  was made  within the past  few days\n          . . .  of the 30th.  I agree the semantics of\n          the  affidavit lead to an interpretation that\n          the buy was made prior to the 30th.\n               However,  the   officer  explained  that\n          preciseness of dates was purposefully avoided\n          when  controlled buys  are made  in order  to\n          safeguard the identity of the informant and I\n          am constrained to accept this.\n               . . . [W]hether or  not Ralph Carty made\n          the   alleged  sale   to  the   informant  on\n          September 30  [sic] really isn't a vital fact\n          to  be  resolved in  order  to  rule on  this\n          motion.  The affidavit premising the issuance\n          of the search warrant did not turn on a  pur-\n          chase  being made  strictly from  Ralph Carty\n          nor does  it say  it was purchased  from him.\n          The crucial fact in the affidavit [is] that a\n          purchase  was made  from  Adelaide Avenue  on\n          September 30 [sic].\n               I  can  understand  [defense  counsel's]\n          argument here but it would be asking too much\n          of  the  Court  to  conclude  that  Detective\n          Cardarelli  is a bold-face perjurer, not only\n          in this courtroom but was at the time that he\n          made the  affidavit and  at the time  that he\n          presented  it to  the  State  District  Court\n          Judge for  the issuance of the  warrant.  And\n          so I  feel constrained  and I do  hereby deny\n          the [suppression] motions. . . .\n\n                                6\n\ndemonstrated that  the controlled buy could not  have occurred as\n\ndescribed in the Cardarelli affidavit.   Without the false state-\n\nments,  he argues,  the affidavit  was insufficient  to establish\n\nprobable  cause.  See Franks,  438 U.S. at  156 (If the defendant\n                            \n\nproves perjury or \"reckless disregard,\" by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, and  the untainted content of the affidavit is insuffi-\n\ncient  to establish probable cause, the fruits of the search must\n\nbe excluded \"to the same extent  as if probable cause was lacking\n\non the face of the affidavit.\").\n\n          We  review the  district court's  findings of  fact for\n\nclear error; its  conclusion of law  de novo.

First and foremost, Cardarelli's suppression hearing\n\ntestimony as to the exact date of the controlled buy (July 30) is\n\nnot inconsistent  with  the time  period  (\"within the  past  few\n\ndays\") he gave in the warrant  affidavit; July 30 at 2:00 to 4:00\n\np.m. was \"within the  past few days\" of  Cardarelli's preparation\n        \n\nof the warrant affidavit, which occurred late in the afternoon or\n\n                                7\n\nearly in the  evening of July  30.  Thus,  the affidavit was  not\n\nnecessarily  inconsistent with  Cardarelli's testimony.   Second,\n\nthe district court, before  whom Cardarelli and Berarducci testi-\n\nfied, credited Cardarelli's explanation  that it was customary to\n\navoid  precise specification of  the dates of  controlled buys in\n\norder  to protect  the identity  of informants.   Finding nothing\n\ninherently inconsistent in Cardarelli's testimony, and mindful of\n\nthe trial court's  superior vantage point, we are  satisfied that\n\nthere is  no sound  basis for second-guessing  its demeanor-based\n\ncredibility  determinations  at the  suppression  hearing.5   See\n                                                                 \n\nWainwright v.

We need not address the merits  of this claim.\nAs the  district court correctly  noted, Carty's presence  at the\ntime the undercover buy occurred was immaterial to the establish-\nment  of probable  cause  to search  the  residence.

In the course of cross-examining Cardarelli\n\nabout  the perceived  discrepancy between  his testimony  and his\n\naffidavit relating to  the date  of the  controlled buy,  defense\n\ncounsel  inquired:  \"Tell  me, Detective Cardarelli,  why are you\n\nrepresented  by Mr.  Bevilacqua?\"   When  the  court refused,  on\n\nrelevancy  grounds,  to  direct  Cardarelli to  answer  over  the\n\ngovernment's objection,  defense counsel  responded by way  of an\n\noffer of  proof:  \"[I]t is  my belief that this  witness is being\n\ninvestigated for corruption  in the police department.\"   Defense\n\ncounsel  hypothesized  that  Cardarelli  may  have  adjusted  the\n\nasserted  date of  the  controlled buy  to  negate Carty's  alibi\n\nevidence.  Counsel argued  that the proposed line  of questioning\n\nwas  intended to  determine  whether Cardarelli  was telling  the\n\ntruth.   Rebuffed by the  district court,7 defense  counsel urged\n\n                    \n\nmotion to suppress.

The court  recognized that  the conclusory  offer of\n\nproof  simply  speculated  that an  investigation  into  possible\n\npolice corruption might be underway and might involve Cardarelli.\n\nThere was no indication as  to the source or basis of  the stated\n\nbelief, no substantiation, and no representation that the federal\n\ngovernment was involved in any such investigation.  Nor was there\n\nany  suggestion that  the  supposed investigation  in any  manner\n\nrelated to the  events at issue in this case.   Thus, the conten-\n\ntion,  advanced  below and  on appeal,  that Cardarelli  may have\n\ntestified with a view to impressing the federal government is not\n\neven  based on  a speculative  belief.   Absent any  such logical\n\nlinkage, the proposed  inquiry was irrelevant,  just as the  dis-\n\ntrict court found.  Moreover, as the district court was  also the\n\nfinder of fact  at the  suppression hearing, the  defense was  on\n\nnotice  that it  needed  to make  the  strongest offer  of  proof\n\npossible to overcome the government's  objection to this line  of\n\ninquiry.

As Carty's  post-arrest state-\n\nments relating to a  cocaine source were probative of  his intent\n\nand opportunity to possess and distribute cocaine, see supra Part\n                                                            \n\nI.B.1.a., and  there was no  \"unfair prejudice,\"8 Rule  403 posed\n\nno barrier to their admission in evidence.9\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     8Although  Carty  suggests  that  the  \"slightest prejudice\"\nresulting  from improper  admission of  the \"other  act\" evidence\nmight  have caused the jury  to disbelieve a  defense witness who\ntestified that  he, rather than  Carty, owned the  weapons seized\nfrom  the  Carty residence,  we are  hard-pressed to  discern any\n                                                                 \nharm.  Since  the jury acquitted Carty  on the cocaine  charge to\nwhich the \"other  act\" evidence related, we consider  the sugges-\ntion far-fetched.\n\n     9Finally,  Carty argues that  the court erred  by not giving\nlimiting instructions to the  jury either contemporaneously or in\nits charge.   Carty waived  the objection by  requesting neither.\nSee Fed.  R. Crim. P. 30 &amp; 52(b).   Moreover, as we are confident\n   \nthat the lack of limiting instructions  did not \"seriously affect\nthe fundamental fairness and basic integrity of the proceedings,\"\nthere was no plain error.  See United States v. Barnett,     F.2d\n                                                       \n   ,     (1st Cir. 1993), No. 91-1890, slip op at 25-26 n.14.\n\n                                16\n\nDissent follows.\n               \n\n                                       \n\n          TORRUELLA,  Circuit  Judge  (Dissenting).    I  dissent\n          TORRUELLA,  Circuit  Judge  (Dissenting).\n                                    \n\nbecause  the so-called \"other  act\" evidence  relating to  a drug\n\nsource  unconnected to the facts of the present case and admitted\n\nunder  Federal  Rules of  Evidence 404(b),  is nothing  more than\n\nimproper  propensity or character  evidence.  I  disagree with my\n\ncolleagues in  the majority  that it  is \"far-fetched\"  that this\n\nevidence influenced the jury in any way because Carty was acquit-\n\nted  of  the cocaine  charge.   Ante, at  16  n.9.   The objected\n                                    \n\nevidence branded him  as a  drug dealer, not  necessarily as  the\n\npossessor  of  the small  amount of  cocaine  found.   As  such a\n\nnefarious person, the jury could very well have believed that the\n\nfirearms were his  tools of  the trade.   The improper  character\n\nevidence easily could  have carried the  day for the  Government,\n\nconsidering  the  highly contradictory  nature  of  the proof  it\n\npresented.  Ante, at 3-5.   In view of the  constitutional burden\n                \n\nrequired of the Government in a criminal case, I fail  to see why\n\nall the speculation  regarding what the  jury did or  did not  do\n\nwith this  improper evidence,  should be weighted  against defen-\n\ndant.\n\n          Appellant should be granted a new trial.\n\n                                17\n</pre>",
