Keith Parkinson appeals from his conviction\n               \n\non a  single count of bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n  2113(a).  He raises  four issues, two involving evidentiary\n\nrulings  at trial  and two  pertaining to  his sentence.   We\n\naffirm the conviction but remand for resentencing.1  \n\n                        I.  Background\n                                      \n\n     Shortly  before noon on February  15, 1990, a man robbed\n\nthe Casco Northern Bank's West End branch in Portland, Maine.\n\nHe handed  the teller a note,  written on the back  of a bank\n\nform, which read, \"Put  all your hundreds and fifties  on the\n\ncounter  now.\"  The teller complied, and the man escaped with\n\n$1300.    At  trial,  the  teller,  Sara  Plourd,  identified\n\ndefendant  as the individual in question.  So did Amy Bolduc,\n\nanother  teller who had been seated adjacent to Plourd at the\n\ntime  of  the  robbery.    (Both  had  separately  identified\n\ndefendant earlier  in a photographic line-up  prepared by the\n\nFBI.)   Defendant  was also  identified  by Roger  Sabin,  an\n\nemployee  of  a  restaurant located  near  the  bank,  as the\n\nindividual who arrived shortly after 11:00  on the morning of\n\nthe  robbery, drank two beers while looking out the window in\n\nthe bank's  direction, and  then departed.   Finally,  an FBI\n\nexpert document  examiner, who had compared  the robbery note\n\n                    \n\n1.  On  December 4, 1992, we  issued an opinion  in this case\naffirming both the conviction and the sentence.   In response\nto defendant's  petition for rehearing, we  have vacated that\nearlier opinion and issued the instant one in its stead.\n\n                             -2-\n\nwith handwriting exemplars obtained from defendant, testified\n\nthat the  note and the exemplars had been written by the same\n\nperson.  Following the one-day trial, defendant was convicted\n\nand sentenced to twenty years in prison.  \n\n             II.  Authentication of Robbery Note\n                                                \n\n     We   first  address   defendant's   argument  that   the\n\ngovernment presented an  inadequate foundation for  admission\n\nof the  robbery note.  At trial, Sara Plourd was asked if she\n\nrecognized the note and responded: \"Yes, that's the note that\n\nthe  man gave me.\"   And following the  note's admission into\n\nevidence, the  FBI document examiner identified  it (by means\n\nof his initials which he had  written on the back) as the one\n\nthat had been sent  to him for examination; as  mentioned, he\n\nalso identified the writing as that  of defendant.  As he did\n\nbelow, defendant now argues that the court erred in admitting\n\nthe  note   because  the   government  failed  to   prove  an\n\nuninterrupted  chain  of custody.    We  review the  district\n\ncourt's  ruling for  abuse of  discretion, see,  e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Collado, 957 F.2d 38, 39 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                 \n\n     Defendant's claim  falters for the reasons  expressed in\n\nUnited States v. Abreu, 952 F.2d 1458, 1467 (1st Cir.), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied,  112 S. Ct. 1695 (1992).  Where \"the offered evidence\n      \n\nis  of  the  type that  is  not  readily  identifiable or  is\n\nsusceptible of alteration, a testimonial tracing of the chain\n\nof custody  is necessary.\"  Id.   The purpose thereof  \"is to\n                               \n\n                             -3-\n\nrender  it  improbable  that   the  original  item  has  been\n\nexchanged  with   another  or  has  been   tampered  with  or\n\ncontaminated.\"  Id.  Yet no  testimony as to chain of custody\n                   \n\nis necessary where the evidence \"is readily identifiable by a\n\nunique  feature or  other  identifying mark.\"   Id.;  accord,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., United  States v. Hernandez-Herrera, 952  F.2d 342, 344\n                                         \n\n(10th Cir. 1991) (where  \"documents are uniquely identifiable\n\nand relatively  resistant to  change, the establishment  of a\n\nchain of custody is  not necessary\"); see also Fed.  R. Evid.\n                                              \n\n901(b)(1)  &amp; (4).  It  is not disputed  that the robbery note\n\nhere fell within this latter category.  See, e.g., M. Graham,\n                                                 \n\nFederal Practice  &amp; Procedure:  Evidence    6822, at  854 n.6\n                                        \n\n(interim ed.  1992) (citing to case involving  holdup note as\n\none involving  \"unique and readily identifiable\"  evidence in\n\nthis  respect).   Authentication  was properly  accomplished,\n\ntherefore,  through Plourd's identification, without the need\n\nfor chain-of-custody testimony. \n\n                III.  Evidence of Other Crimes\n                                              \n\n     Defendant's  next challenge  involves evidence  that was\n\nnever  introduced at trial.  The day after the Maine robbery,\n\ndefendant  committed a  similar bank  robbery in  Boston;2 by\n\nthe  time of  the Maine  trial, he  had pled  guilty to  this\n\n                    \n\n2.  From the  government's brief  offer of proof,  it appears\nthat this robbery occurred at approximately noon, when a note\nwritten on the back of a bank form, and containing  the words\n\"Put  your hundreds,  fifties on  counter,\"  was handed  to a\nteller.\n\n                             -4-\n\noffense and been  sentenced therefor  in Massachusetts  state\n\ncourt.   Defendant's  criminal history  involved a  series of\n\nother offenses, including convictions in 1977 for kidnapping,\n\nrobbery and  rape, and  earlier convictions for,  inter alia,\n                                                            \n\naggravated  assault,  larceny,  and escape.    The government\n\nplanned  to introduce  evidence of  the Boston  robbery under\n\nFed.  R.  Evid.  404(b)  in order  to  establish  defendant's\n\nidentity;  it  also  indicated  that,  should  the  defendant\n\ntestify, it  planned to introduce evidence of all his earlier\n\nconvictions  under Fed. R. Evid.  609 in order  to attack his\n\ncredibility.  Defendant  filed a motion in limine  seeking to\n                                                 \n\nexclude  all such evidence of his past convictions.  During a\n\nbreak  in the  trial, the court  addressed these  matters and\n\nissued a three-part  ruling.   It held that  evidence of  the\n\nBoston robbery  was admissible  under Rule 404(b),  given the\n\nsimilarity of the  two robberies and  the fact that  identity\n\nwas  the major  issue at  trial.3   As to  the admissibility,\n\n                    \n\n3.  The government planned to introduce proof of this robbery\nthrough the testimony of the arresting Boston Police officer.\nNo voir dire was held (or requested); instead, the government\n            \ndescribed  the  officer's  anticipated  testimony  through an\noffer of proof.  The court's ruling was therefore necessarily\nconditional.  It held in part: \"I believe that the government\nhas satisfied Rule 404(b),  that [given] the circumstances as\ndescribed, if that  is the gist  of the witness's  testimony,\n                                                            \nthat  the jury  could indeed  conclude that it  confirmed the\nidentity of the  defendant, if the jargon  of signature crime\nis used.\"  Tr. at 103-04 (emphasis added).  The court went on\nto find, under  Rule 403,  that the probative  value of  such\nevidence was  not substantially  outweighed by the  danger of\nunfair prejudice.  Id.   See Advisory Committee Note  to Rule\n                            \n\n                             -5-\n\nunder Rule 609, of defendant's convictions in 1977, the court\n\nreserved judgment pending defendant's testimony.  And it held\n\ndefendant's other  convictions to be  inadmissible under Rule\n\n609.\n\n     As it turned  out, none of this  evidence was introduced\n\nand defendant did  not testify.   In response  to an  inquiry\n\nfrom the  court, defense  counsel indicated that  the primary\n\nreason  for  defendant  to  testify  would  be  to  rebut  or\n\notherwise explain  the Boston robbery; if  that evidence were\n\nnot to be introduced,  there would be a  \"minimal\" likelihood\n\nof  the defendant testifying.4  The court then encouraged the\n\ngovernment  to  consider  whether  to  introduce  the  Boston\n\nrobbery  evidence,  and  suggested that  both  sides  confer.\n\nDuring a  recess, the  government and defense  counsel agreed\n\nthat if the evidence of that robbery were not introduced, the\n\n                    \n\n404(b) (explaining requisite balancing  test by reference  to\nRule 403 factors).    \n\n4.  The exchange between the court and defense counsel was as\nfollows:\n          THE COURT:     [A]m  I  correct  in  believing\n     that the  only witness  for the defendant  would be\n     the defendant himself?\n          MR. DILWORTH:  Probably, yes.\n          THE COURT:     Now  as  I understand  it also,\n     your decision to put the defendant on is because of\n     the 404(b)  testimony, if that were  not coming in,\n     you would not be putting him on?\n          MR. DILWORTH:  Well, it's his decision.\n          THE COURT:     I understand. \n          MR. DILWORTH:  I  would say the chances of him\n     testifying are  much, much less.   I'd say minimal,\n     if the 404 evidence wasn't coming in.\nTr. at 125.\n\n                             -6-\n\ndefendant would  not testify.  Defense  counsel and defendant\n\nboth  affirmatively  acknowledged  to  the  court  that  they\n\napproved of  this arrangement.5  The  government then rested,\n\nas did the defense without putting on any witnesses.\n\n     Defendant  now  seeks to  challenge  the  denial of  his\n\nmotion in  limine  to  exclude  the evidence  of  the  Boston\n                 \n\nrobbery.  We agree with the government that, based on a  line\n\nof cases commencing with  Luce v. United States, 469  U.S. 38\n                                               \n\n(1984),  defendant  has failed  to  preserve  this issue  for\n\nappeal.  \n\n     The defendant  in  Luce filed  an  in limine  motion  to\n                                                 \n\npreclude  the government  (in  the event  he testified)  from\n\nrelying on an earlier conviction to impeach him under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 609(a).  The motion was denied, yet defendant chose not\n\nto testify and the impeachment evidence was never introduced.\n\nThe Court held  that \"to  raise and preserve  for review  the\n\nclaim  of improper  impeachment  with a  prior conviction,  a\n\ndefendant  must testify.\"    Id. at  43.   It  cited  various\n                                \n\nreasons  for  this  decision.   First,  without  the  precise\n\nfactual context  that such testimony would  have provided, an\n\nappellate court is handicapped in reviewing the balance drawn\n\nbetween probative value and  prejudice.  Id. at 41.   Second,\n                                            \n\n                    \n\n5.  Defense  counsel  stated:  \"I've discussed  this  with my\nclient, Your Honor, and  he's decided that he's not  going to\ntestify on  the condition that  the government agrees  not to\nintroduce the Rule 404(b) evidence.\"  Tr. at 127.  Defendant,\nin response to the court's inquiry, confirmed this.\n\n                             -7-\n\nfor  much the same reason, the trial court's in limine ruling\n                                                      \n\nis necessarily tentative and \"subject to change when the case\n\nunfolds\";  any  possible  harm  stemming  therefrom  is  thus\n\n\"wholly speculative.\"  Id. at 41.  Third, there is  no way of\n                          \n\nknowing whether  the government ultimately would have elected\n\nto  use  the impeachment  evidence.   Id. at  42.   Fourth, a\n                                         \n\nreviewing court cannot tell to what degree, if at all, the in\n                                                             \n\nlimine ruling contributed to a defendant's decision to remain\n      \n\nsilent.   Id.  And finally, given the difficulty of reviewing\n             \n\nfor  harmless  error in  the  absence of  a  concrete factual\n\nsetting,  requiring  a  defendant  to  testify  in  order  to\n\npreserve his  objections makes it more  difficult to \"'plant'\n\nreversible error\" in the record.  Id. \n                                     \n\n     We have joined other  courts in extending this reasoning\n\nbeyond  the  confines  of Rule  609.    In  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nGriffin, 818 F.2d 97  (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484  U.S. 844\n                                              \n\n(1987), for example, we applied Luce to the Rule 403 context.\n                                    \n\nThere,  the  prosecutor  proposed  to  explain  a  government\n\nwitness' delay in  coming forward by  offering evidence of  a\n\nthird-party  threat against  him.   The  court sustained  the\n\ndefendant's objection  to such  evidence under Rule  403, but\n\nwarned that, if  defense counsel  cross-examined the  witness\n\nconcerning  such  delay,  the  prosecution  could   use  such\n\nevidence in  rebuttal.  No  such cross-examination  occurred,\n\nand the \"threat\"  evidence was thus never introduced.  Noting\n\n                             -8-\n\nthat  Rule   403  \"necessitates   much  the  same   genre  of\n\ncomparative  analysis\" as Rule  609, id. at  104, and finding\n                                        \n\neach  of   the  Luce   concerns  applicable,  we   held  that\n                    \n\ndefendant's challenge  to such  ruling never ripened  into an\n\nappealable issue.   Id. at 103-06.  See also United States v.\n                                                          \n\nNivica,  887 F.2d  1110, 1115-17  (1st Cir.  1989) (defendant\n      \n\nsought  advance ruling  that, if  he took  the  stand, cross-\n\nexamination  would be limited to  the scope of  direct and to\n\nquestions bearing  on  credibility; motion  was  denied,  but\n\ndefendant never testified or  asked for voir dire;  held that\n                                                 \n\nruling  was  not appealable),  cert.  denied,  494 U.S.  1005\n                                            \n\n(1990).   And other courts  have applied Luce  to Rule 404(b)\n                                             \n\nsituations similar to that involved here.  See, e.g.,  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.

In  each of them, the evidence\n\nin question  was held  to be  conditionally admissible.   The\n\ntrial  court in  each instance  ruled that  it could  only be\n\nintroduced  if  a subsequent  event  occurred  (i.e., if  the\n              \n\ndefendant in  Luce  or Nivica  or Johnson  testified; if  the\n                                         \n\ndefendant in Griffin challenged the witness'  credibility; if\n                    \n\nthe defendant in Johnson raised the personal-use issue).  And\n                        \n\nin  each  instance,  the  merits of  the  evidentiary  ruling\n                                \n\nnecessarily  depended (to  a greater  or lesser  extent) upon\n\nfurther factual  development.  As we stated  in Nivica: \"None\n                                                      \n\nof these requests [in Luce,  Griffin and Nivica] were capable\n                                               \n\nof  meaningful  resolution  in  a vacuum.    Ultimately,  the\n\ntrier's  decision, whatever his  initial inclination,  had to\n\ndepend upon ... development  of a specific record ....\"   887\n\nF.2d at 1117.  In the  instant case, by contrast, there is no\n\nsuch connection  between the  court's Rule 404(b)  ruling and\n\nthe defendant's  prospective testimony.  The  evidence of the\n\nBoston robbery was not  rebuttal or impeachment evidence; the\n\ngovernment was permitted to introduce it in its case-in-chief\n\n                    \n\n6.  The Johnson court explained:  \"Although Luce was  decided\n                                                \nunder Fed. R. Evid.  609(a)(1), its logic applies  with equal\nforce to  motions under  Rule 404.\"   767 F.2d  at 1270.   We\nquoted this  comment with  apparent approval in  Griffin, 818\n                                                        \nF.2d at 105.\n\n                             -10-\n\nto  establish  identity.7    Accordingly,   the  Rule  404(b)\n\ndetermination here  could have  been definitively made  (in a\n\nconcrete  factual  setting  allowing  for  appellate  review)\n\nduring the government's case-in-chief.  \n\n     For this  reason, the first Luce concern--the difficulty\n                                     \n\nof  balancing   probative  and  prejudicial  effects   in  an\n\nevidentiary vacuum--could  have been avoided here.   Yet that\n\nfactor  is  in  fact  implicated, due  to  circumstances  not\n\ninvolved in the  above cases.   While the  Rule 404(b)  issue\n\ncould have  been definitively  resolved here and  an adequate\n     \n\nrecord developed, such did not occur.  The government's offer\n\nof  proof only  outlined the  anticipated testimony  from the\n\nBoston officer in generalized  fashion, providing few details\n\nconcerning the second robbery.8   Defendant never requested a\n\nvoir  dire.   See  Griffin, 818  F.2d  at 105  (\"counsel  may\n                          \n\n                    \n\n7.  The  fact   that  defendant's  decision  not  to  testify\nresulted in  that evidence  not being introduced  was nothing\nmore  than happenstance,  stemming solely  from the  parties'\nlast-minute agreement.  \n\n8.  The Court  in Luce held that an offer of proof was not an\n                      \nacceptable   substitute   for  actual   testimony,   since  a\ndefendant's  \"trial   testimony  could,  for  any  number  of\nreasons,  differ  from the  proffer.\"   469  U.S. at  41 n.5.\nGiven  the  limited  and  specific nature  of  the  testimony\nexpected from the  Boston officer, one might  argue that this\nconcern is  of less weight here.  Cf. Ortiz, 857 F.2d at 906-\n                                           \n07  (Pierce, J., concurring) (rejecting applicability of Luce\n                                                             \nbecause,  unlike   the  anticipated  testimony   there,  \"the\ndistrict court could, prospectively,  have reviewed what  the\n                    \ndefense counsel's  arguments would have been,  and could have\nheld the  defense counsel  to those proffers  of argument.\").\nWe need not decide  this issue, since the proffer  here lacks\nsufficient details to permit meaningful review in any event.\n\n                             -11-\n\nrequest that ... the  actual testimony be screened  voir dire\n                                                             \n\nin the  jury's  absence\" in  order  to supply  the  necessary\n\ncontext).   The court was  thus compelled to  make its ruling\n\ncontingent on the Boston's officer's testimony turning out to\n\nbe as described.  On this record, any effort by this court to\n\nreview  the district  court's  balancing  of probative  value\n\nversus  prejudicial   effect  would   be  difficult   if  not\n\nimpossible.  \n\n     Each  of  the  remaining  Luce  factors,   moreover,  is\n                                   \n\ndirectly implicated.   The district court  might have altered\n\nits  ruling upon hearing the Boston officer's testimony.  The\n\ngovernment  might have  elected independently  to  forgo such\n\nevidence,   given  the   strength   of  its   case.     Other\n\nconsiderations, such as the prospect of the Rule 609 evidence\n\nbeing  admitted,   might  have  contributed   to  defendant's\n\ndecision not to testify.  And the sparse factual record would\n\nhave  hampered any review  by this court  for harmless error.\n\nAccordingly,  we conclude  that defendant's challenge  to the\n\nRule 404(b)  ruling never  ripened into an  appealable issue.\n\nCf. Freeman v.  Package Machinery Corp., 865 F.2d  1331, 1337\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (warning that litigants must exercise caution\n\nin relying on in  limine rulings as the basis  for preserving\n                        \n\nevidentiary objections).\n\n                       IV.  Sentencing\n                                      \n\n                             -12-\n\n     Relying  on    4B1.1 of  the sentencing  guidelines, the\n\ndistrict court  classified  defendant as  a career  offender.\n\nThis yielded  a criminal history  category of VI,  an offense\n\nlevel  of 32,  and  (in light  of  the statutory  maximum)  a\n\nsentencing range  of 210-240 months.   The court  imposed the\n\nmaximum of 240 months, and ordered that it  run consecutively\n\nto the  ten-to-twenty year sentence imposed  earlier in state\n\ncourt  for the  Massachusetts bank  robbery.9   Defendant now\n\nargues, as  he did briefly  below, that under  the guidelines\n\nthe federal sentence must run at  least partly in concurrence\n\nwith his  state  sentence.10    In  a  related  argument,  he\n\ncontends that  the court employed an  erroneous offense level\n\nin calculating that a consecutive sentence was warranted.  As\n\nwe  find  this  latter  contention persuasive,  we  need  not\n\naddress the former.  \n\n     Section  5G1.3 addresses the  sentencing of  a defendant\n\nsubject  to an  undischarged term  of imprisonment.11   Three\n\n                    \n\n9.  The state sentencing occurred in April 1990.\n\n10.  His  principal  argument  below  was  that  the  federal\nsentence  should  have  been completely  concurrent  with his\n                                       \nstate sentence.  He has abandoned this contention on appeal.\n\n11.  An  amended  version  of  this section  took  effect  on\nNovember   1,  1991--thirteen   days  prior   to  defendant's\nsentencing.  As he  did below, defendant in his  brief relies\non  the  earlier version,  without mentioning  such revision.\nYet, the amended version of   5G1.3 does not adversely affect\ndefendant's sentencing; indeed, it lends some strength to the\narguments  he advances  here.   As  such,  no ex  post  facto\n                                                             \nconcerns  arise, and the amended version governs.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \nUnited States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 66 n.1 (1st Cir. 1991)\n                        \n\n                             -13-\n\nseparate categories  of situations  are set forth,  each with\n\ndifferent sentencing ramifications.  Subsection  (a) requires\n\nimposition  of a  consecutive sentence  where, inter  alia, a\n                                                          \n\ndefendant  commits  an   offense  while  serving   (or  after\n\nsentencing for, but  before commencing service of)  a term of\n\nimprisonment.     This   provision   is  inapplicable   here.\n\nSubsection (b)  applies where,  inter alia,  the undischarged\n                                          \n\nprison term resulted  from \"offense(s) that constituted  part\n\nof the same course of conduct as the instant offense and have\n\nbeen fully taken  into account  in the  determination of  the\n\noffense level for the instant offense.\"   In such a case, the\n\nsentence  should produce  a  combined sentence  equal to  the\n\ntotal punishment  that would have been imposed  under   5G1.2\n\nhad  all sentences  been imposed  at the  same time,  with an\n\nadjustment for time already  served.  This provision likewise\n\nappears inapplicable.  While  the Boston robbery was included\n\nin  defendant's   criminal  history,  it  did   not  in  fact\n\ncontribute to  his offense  level: defendant would  have been\n\nclassified  as  a  career  offender  even  without  reference\n\nthereto.\n\n                    \n\n(\"Barring ex post facto concerns, the guidelines in effect at\n                       \nthe  time of sentencing, not  those in effect  when the crime\nwas committed,  control  at sentencing.\");  United States  v.\n                                                         \nCousens, 942 F.2d  800, 801 n.1  (1st Cir. 1991).   (We  also\n       \nnote that    5G1.3  was again amended  effective November  1,\n1992--after defendant's sentencing.)\n\n                             -14-\n\n     The remaining provision  provides: \"In  any other  case,\n\nthe  sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run\n\nconsecutively to the prior  unexpired term of imprisonment to\n\nthe  extent  necessary to  achieve  a reasonable  incremental\n\npunishment  for the instant offense.\"   Id.    5G1.3(c).  The\n                                           \n\ncommentary elaborates as follows:\n\n     To the extent practicable, the court shall impose a\n     sentence for the instant  offense that results in a\n     combined  sentence  that  approximates   the  total\n     punishment  that would  have been  imposed  under  \n     5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction)\n     had all  of the offenses been  federal offenses for\n     which  sentences were  being  imposed at  the  same\n     time.\n\nId. comment. (n.4).  Section 5G1.2(b), in turn, provides that\n   \n\n\"the  sentence imposed ...  shall be the  total punishment as\n\ndetermined in accordance with  Part D of Chapter Three  ....\"\n\nAnd     5G1.2(d)  provides  that  consecutive  sentences  are\n\npermissible  \"only  to  the  extent necessary  to  produce  a\n\ncombined sentence equal to the total punishment.\"12  \n\n     The district  court determined that, had  both robberies\n\nbeen   considered  together   for  purposes   of  sentencing,\n\n                    \n\n12.  Section 5G1.2(d) reads in full as follows: \n\n     If the  sentence imposed on the  count carrying the\n     highest statutory  maximum is  less than  the total\n     punishment, then  the sentence  imposed  on one  or\n     more of the  other counts shall run  consecutively,\n     but  only  to the  extent  necessary  to produce  a\n     combined  sentence equal  to the  total punishment.\n     In all other respects sentences on all counts shall\n     run  concurrently, except  to the  extent otherwise\n     required by law.\n\n                             -15-\n\ndefendant would have faced a \"total punishment\" of 262 to 327\n\nmonths.   It reached  this conclusion in  part by calculating\n\nthat, under   3D1.4 (which  provides for the determination of\n\na  combined  offense  level  for multiple  counts),  the  two\n\nrobberies  would   have  led  to  a   two-level  increase  in\n\ndefendant's offense  level.  The court  applied this increase\n\nto  the career  offender level  of 32  derived from    4B1.1,\n\nresulting in  an offense level of  34.  (A level of  34 and a\n\ncriminal   history  category  of   VI  yields  the  indicated\n\nsentencing  range.)    Defendant   now  argues  that  it  was\n\ninappropriate to apply the two-level increase from   3D1.4(a)\n\nto the career offender level derived from   4B1.1.\n\n     Defendant is  correct in this regard,  as the government\n\neffectively  concedes.  Section  4B1.1 specifically provides:\n\n\"If  the offense level for  a career criminal  from the table\n\nbelow is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable,\n\nthe  offense level from the  table below shall  apply.\"  This\n\ndirective makes  clear that  \"the  career offender  guideline\n\nsupersede[s]  the  'otherwise  applicable   offense  level.'\"\n\nUnited States v.  Elwell, No.  91-1621, slip op.  at 18  (1st\n                        \n\nCir. Jan.  20, 1993).   The  \"Application Instructions\"  in  \n\n1B1.1 confirm the point.  As we explained in United States v.\n                                                          \n\nAlves, 873 F.2d  495 (1st  Cir. 1989), the  first step  under\n     \n\nthat section's sequential format is to use the actual statute\n\nof conviction to determine the offense level,   1B1.1(a)-(b),\n\n                             -16-\n\nand  then  to apply  any  adjustments  deriving from  Chapter\n\nThree,   1B1.1(c)-(e).  \n\n     After  this is  done,  the court  looks  to see  if\n     provisions  in Chapter  4,  Part B  apply, such  as\n     career offender provisions,  which may set  another\n     offense level.     1B1.1(f)....   The guidelines do\n                                                        \n     not  then  apply  the   adjustments  noted  in     \n                                                        \n     1B1.1(c)-(e)  to  the  level  found  for  a  career\n                                                        \n     offender....   If the application  instructions are\n             \n     followed in  the order written,  as they presumably\n     should be, a career  criminal is never allowed [the\n     reductions specified in Chapter Three].\n\n873 F.2d at 497 (emphasis added). \n\n     For this reason, we have on several occasions noted that\n\nthe applicability  of   4B1.1  obviated any  need to  examine\n\npotential  offense-level  adjustments  deriving from  Chapter\n\nThree.   See, e.g.,  Elwell, supra, slip  op. at 18  (role in\n                                  \n\noffense under   3B1); United States v.

Subsequent to our Alves decision,   4B1.1 was amended to\n                            \npermit  a reduction in the offense level of a career offender\nfor acceptance of responsibility.   No other such adjustments\nderiving from Chapter Three have been authorized.\n\n                             -17-\n\n588 (7th  Cir.), cert. denied,  112 S. Ct.  96 (1991).14   It\n                             \n\nis  apparent, therefore,  that  the district  court erred  by\n\nadding the  two-level increase  derived from    3D1.4  to the\n\ncareer offender level derived from   4B1.1.15\n\n     The  government, while  not contesting  this conclusion,\n\nargues that  a remand for  resentencing is  unnecessary.   It\n\nreasons  as follows.    (1) Without  the two-level  increase,\n\ndefendant's offense  level  would be  32.   With  a  criminal\n\nhistory category of  VI, he  thus would have  faced a  \"total\n\npunishment\"  of  210-262  months  had  both  robberies   been\n\nconsidered together.   (2)  As the two  sentences now  stand,\n\ndefendant could end up serving a combined total of  as few as\n\n284  months.16   (3) While 284  exceeds 262 (the  high end of\n\n                    \n\n14.  The  fact that    5G1.2(b)  specifically refers  back to\n\"the total punishment as determined in accordance with Part D\nof  Chapter  Three\"  does  not  change  this  result.    That\nreference necessarily encompasses  any additional  adjustment\nfrom   4B1 as well.  The final provision in Part D of Chapter\nThree makes this clear.  Section 3D1.5, entitled \"Determining\nthe Total Punishment,\" reads: \"Use the combined offense level\nto determine the appropriate  sentence in accordance with the\nprovisions of Chapter Five.\"  And the accompanying Commentary\nadds: \"The  combined offense level is  subject to adjustments\nfrom ... Chapter Four, Part B ....\"\n\n15.  The   court's  oversight  was   understandable,  as  the\nmiscalculation was  contained in  the presentence  report and\nwas embraced below by both  the defendant and the government.\nIndeed, it was  advanced by  both parties on  appeal and  was\nadopted  by this  court in the  original decision;  not until\ndefendant  filed his  petition  for rehearing  was the  error\nmentioned.\n\n16.  The  government   calculates  as  follows.     Defendant\nreceived a ten-to-twenty year sentence in state court.  Under\nMass. G.L. c. 127,   129, the Commonwealth deducts twelve and\n\n                             -18-\n\nthe  applicable  sentencing  range  had both  robberies  been\n\nconsidered  together),  it is  close  enough  to satisfy  the\n\nguidelines.  For as noted above, the guidelines only call for\n\na  sentence  that \"approximates\"  the  total punishment  that\n\nwould have been imposed, \"to the extent practicable.\"\n\n     We  need  not address  the  validity  of these  specific\n\ncontentions, as we conclude that a remand for resentencing is\n\nappropriate in any event.   In the original opinion  we noted\n\nthat  (again  due  largely  to the  parties'  oversight)  the\n\ndistrict court failed to employ the  methodology set forth in\n\nthe applicable version  of    5G1.3 in deciding  to impose  a\n\nconsecutive  sentence.    We   think  that  this   additional\n\nshortcoming, when combined  with the erroneous  offense-level\n\ncalculation, suffices  under the  circumstances to  warrant a\n\nremand.  We intimate no view as to the appropriateness of (1)\n\nany specific sentence  to be imposed upon resentencing or (2)\n\nany  upward or  downward  departure that  either party  might\n\nrequest.\n\n                    \n\none-half  days  from the  sentence  for  each  month of  good\nconduct, meaning that with such credits defendant would serve\nat  most eleven years and nine months.  More important, under\nG.L.  c. 127,   133,  defendant would be  eligible for parole\nafter serving two-thirds of his minimum sentence--i.e., after\n80 months.   As to  the federal sentence,  under 18 U.S.C.   \n3624(b),  defendant would  receive a  54-day credit  for each\nyear  of \"satisfactory  behavior,\"  meaning he  could end  up\nserving  204 months  out  of  the  240  imposed.    For  both\nsentences in conjunction, therefore,  he could end up serving\nas few as 284 months.\n\n                             -19-\n\n     The conviction is affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and\n                                                             \n\nthe case is remanded for resentencing.  \n                                      \n\n                             -20-\n",

He raises  four issues, two involving evidentiary\n\nrulings  at trial  and two  pertaining to  his sentence.   We\n\naffirm the conviction but remand for resentencing.1  \n\n                        I.  Background\n                                      \n\n     Shortly  before noon on February  15, 1990, a man robbed\n\nthe Casco Northern Bank's West End branch in Portland, Maine.\n\nHe handed  the teller a note,  written on the back  of a bank\n\nform, which read, \"Put  all your hundreds and fifties  on the\n\ncounter  now.\"  The teller complied, and the man escaped with\n\n$1300.    At  trial,  the  teller,  Sara  Plourd,  identified\n\ndefendant  as the individual in question.  So did Amy Bolduc,\n\nanother  teller who had been seated adjacent to Plourd at the\n\ntime  of  the  robbery.    (Both  had  separately  identified\n\ndefendant earlier  in a photographic line-up  prepared by the\n\nFBI.)   Defendant  was also  identified  by Roger  Sabin,  an\n\nemployee  of  a  restaurant located  near  the  bank,  as the\n\nindividual who arrived shortly after 11:00  on the morning of\n\nthe  robbery, drank two beers while looking out the window in\n\nthe bank's  direction, and  then departed.   Finally,  an FBI\n\nexpert document  examiner, who had compared  the robbery note\n\n                    \n\n1.  On  December 4, 1992, we  issued an opinion  in this case\naffirming both the conviction and the sentence.   In response\nto defendant's  petition for rehearing, we  have vacated that\nearlier opinion and issued the instant one in its stead.\n\n                             -2-\n\nwith handwriting exemplars obtained from defendant, testified\n\nthat the  note and the exemplars had been written by the same\n\nperson.  Following the one-day trial, defendant was convicted\n\nand sentenced to twenty years in prison.  \n\n             II.  Authentication of Robbery Note\n                                                \n\n     We   first  address   defendant's   argument  that   the\n\ngovernment presented an  inadequate foundation for  admission\n\nof the  robbery note.  At trial, Sara Plourd was asked if she\n\nrecognized the note and responded: \"Yes, that's the note that\n\nthe  man gave me.\"   And following the  note's admission into\n\nevidence, the  FBI document examiner identified  it (by means\n\nof his initials which he had  written on the back) as the one\n\nthat had been sent  to him for examination; as  mentioned, he\n\nalso identified the writing as that  of defendant.  As he did\n\nbelow, defendant now argues that the court erred in admitting\n\nthe  note   because  the   government  failed  to   prove  an\n\nuninterrupted  chain  of custody.    We  review the  district\n\ncourt's  ruling for  abuse of  discretion, see,  e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.

Graham,\n                                                 \n\nFederal Practice  &amp; Procedure:  Evidence    6822, at  854 n.6\n                                        \n\n(interim ed.  1992) (citing to case involving  holdup note as\n\none involving  \"unique and readily identifiable\"  evidence in\n\nthis  respect).   Authentication  was properly  accomplished,\n\ntherefore,  through Plourd's identification, without the need\n\nfor chain-of-custody testimony. \n\n                III.  Evidence of Other Crimes\n                                              \n\n     Defendant's  next challenge  involves evidence  that was\n\nnever  introduced at trial.  The day after the Maine robbery,\n\ndefendant  committed a  similar bank  robbery in  Boston;2 by\n\nthe  time of  the Maine  trial, he  had pled  guilty to  this\n\n                    \n\n2.  From the  government's brief  offer of proof,  it appears\nthat this robbery occurred at approximately noon, when a note\nwritten on the back of a bank form, and containing  the words\n\"Put  your hundreds,  fifties on  counter,\"  was handed  to a\nteller.\n\n                             -4-\n\noffense and been  sentenced therefor  in Massachusetts  state\n\ncourt.   Defendant's  criminal history  involved a  series of\n\nother offenses, including convictions in 1977 for kidnapping,\n\nrobbery and  rape, and  earlier convictions for,  inter alia,\n                                                            \n\naggravated  assault,  larceny,  and escape.    The government\n\nplanned  to introduce  evidence of  the Boston  robbery under\n\nFed.  R.  Evid.  404(b)  in order  to  establish  defendant's\n\nidentity;  it  also  indicated  that,  should  the  defendant\n\ntestify, it  planned to introduce evidence of all his earlier\n\nconvictions  under Fed. R. Evid.  609 in order  to attack his\n\ncredibility.  Defendant  filed a motion in limine  seeking to\n                                                 \n\nexclude  all such evidence of his past convictions.  During a\n\nbreak  in the  trial, the court  addressed these  matters and\n\nissued a three-part  ruling.   It held that  evidence of  the\n\nBoston robbery  was admissible  under Rule 404(b),  given the\n\nsimilarity of the  two robberies and  the fact that  identity\n\nwas  the major  issue at  trial.3   As to  the admissibility,\n\n                    \n\n3.  The government planned to introduce proof of this robbery\nthrough the testimony of the arresting Boston Police officer.\nNo voir dire was held (or requested); instead, the government\n            \ndescribed  the  officer's  anticipated  testimony  through an\noffer of proof.  The court's ruling was therefore necessarily\nconditional.  It held in part: \"I believe that the government\nhas satisfied Rule 404(b),  that [given] the circumstances as\ndescribed, if that  is the gist  of the witness's  testimony,\n                                                            \nthat  the jury  could indeed  conclude that it  confirmed the\nidentity of the  defendant, if the jargon  of signature crime\nis used.\"  Tr. at 103-04 (emphasis added).  The court went on\nto find, under  Rule 403,  that the probative  value of  such\nevidence was  not substantially  outweighed by the  danger of\nunfair prejudice.  Id.   See Advisory Committee Note  to Rule\n                            \n\n                             -5-\n\nunder Rule 609, of defendant's convictions in 1977, the court\n\nreserved judgment pending defendant's testimony.  And it held\n\ndefendant's other  convictions to be  inadmissible under Rule\n\n609.\n\n     As it turned  out, none of this  evidence was introduced\n\nand defendant did  not testify.   In response  to an  inquiry\n\nfrom the  court, defense  counsel indicated that  the primary\n\nreason  for  defendant  to  testify  would  be  to  rebut  or\n\notherwise explain  the Boston robbery; if  that evidence were\n\nnot to be introduced,  there would be a  \"minimal\" likelihood\n\nof  the defendant testifying.4  The court then encouraged the\n\ngovernment  to  consider  whether  to  introduce  the  Boston\n\nrobbery  evidence,  and  suggested that  both  sides  confer.\n\nDuring a  recess, the  government and defense  counsel agreed\n\nthat if the evidence of that robbery were not introduced, the\n\n                    \n\n404(b) (explaining requisite balancing  test by reference  to\nRule 403 factors).    \n\n4.  The exchange between the court and defense counsel was as\nfollows:\n          THE COURT:     [A]m  I  correct  in  believing\n     that the  only witness  for the defendant  would be\n     the defendant himself?\n          MR. DILWORTH:  Probably, yes.\n          THE COURT:     Now  as  I understand  it also,\n     your decision to put the defendant on is because of\n     the 404(b)  testimony, if that were  not coming in,\n     you would not be putting him on?\n          MR. DILWORTH:  Well, it's his decision.\n          THE COURT:     I understand. \n          MR. DILWORTH:  I  would say the chances of him\n     testifying are  much, much less.   I'd say minimal,\n     if the 404 evidence wasn't coming in.\nTr. at 125.\n\n                             -6-\n\ndefendant would  not testify.  Defense  counsel and defendant\n\nboth  affirmatively  acknowledged  to  the  court  that  they\n\napproved of  this arrangement.5  The  government then rested,\n\nas did the defense without putting on any witnesses.\n\n     Defendant  now  seeks to  challenge  the  denial of  his\n\nmotion in  limine  to  exclude  the evidence  of  the  Boston\n                 \n\nrobbery.  We agree with the government that, based on a  line\n\nof cases commencing with  Luce v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111284\"><a href=\"/opinion/111284/luce-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                                               \n\n(1984),  defendant  has failed  to  preserve  this issue  for\n\nappeal.  \n\n     The defendant  in  Luce filed  an  in limine  motion  to\n                                                 \n\npreclude  the government  (in  the event  he testified)  from\n\nrelying on an earlier conviction to impeach him under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 609(a).  The motion was denied, yet defendant chose not\n\nto testify and the impeachment evidence was never introduced.\n\nThe Court held  that \"to  raise and preserve  for review  the\n\nclaim  of improper  impeachment  with a  prior conviction,  a\n\ndefendant  must testify.\"    Id. at  43.   It  cited  various\n                                \n\nreasons  for  this  decision.   First,  without  the  precise\n\nfactual context  that such testimony would  have provided, an\n\nappellate court is handicapped in reviewing the balance drawn\n\nbetween probative value and  prejudice.  Id. at 41.   Second,\n                                            \n\n                    \n\n5.  Defense  counsel  stated:  \"I've discussed  this  with my\nclient, Your Honor, and  he's decided that he's not  going to\ntestify on  the condition that  the government agrees  not to\nintroduce the Rule 404(b) evidence.\"  Tr. at 127.  Defendant,\nin response to the court's inquiry, confirmed this.\n\n                             -7-\n\nfor  much the same reason, the trial court's in limine ruling\n                                                      \n\nis necessarily tentative and \"subject to change when the case\n\nunfolds\";  any  possible  harm  stemming  therefrom  is  thus\n\n\"wholly speculative.\"  Id. at 41.  Third, there is  no way of\n                          \n\nknowing whether  the government ultimately would have elected\n\nto  use  the impeachment  evidence.   Id. at  42.   Fourth, a\n                                         \n\nreviewing court cannot tell to what degree, if at all, the in\n                                                             \n\nlimine ruling contributed to a defendant's decision to remain\n      \n\nsilent.   Id.  And finally, given the difficulty of reviewing\n             \n\nfor  harmless  error in  the  absence of  a  concrete factual\n\nsetting,  requiring  a  defendant  to  testify  in  order  to\n\npreserve his  objections makes it more  difficult to \"'plant'\n\nreversible error\" in the record.

In  each of them, the evidence\n\nin question  was held  to be  conditionally admissible.   The\n\ntrial  court in  each instance  ruled that  it could  only be\n\nintroduced  if  a subsequent  event  occurred  (i.e., if  the\n              \n\ndefendant in  Luce  or Nivica  or Johnson  testified; if  the\n                                         \n\ndefendant in Griffin challenged the witness'  credibility; if\n                    \n\nthe defendant in Johnson raised the personal-use issue).  And\n                        \n\nin  each  instance,  the  merits of  the  evidentiary  ruling\n                                \n\nnecessarily  depended (to  a greater  or lesser  extent) upon\n\nfurther factual  development.

In the  instant case, by contrast, there is no\n\nsuch connection  between the  court's Rule 404(b)  ruling and\n\nthe defendant's  prospective testimony.  The  evidence of the\n\nBoston robbery was not  rebuttal or impeachment evidence; the\n\ngovernment was permitted to introduce it in its case-in-chief\n\n                    \n\n6.  The Johnson court explained:  \"Although Luce was  decided\n                                                \nunder Fed. R.

We\nquoted this  comment with  apparent approval in  Griffin, 818\n                                                        \nF.2d at 105.\n\n                             -10-\n\nto  establish  identity.7    Accordingly,   the  Rule  404(b)\n\ndetermination here  could have  been definitively made  (in a\n\nconcrete  factual  setting  allowing  for  appellate  review)\n\nduring the government's case-in-chief.  \n\n     For this  reason, the first Luce concern--the difficulty\n                                     \n\nof  balancing   probative  and  prejudicial  effects   in  an\n\nevidentiary vacuum--could  have been avoided here.   Yet that\n\nfactor  is  in  fact  implicated, due  to  circumstances  not\n\ninvolved in the  above cases.   While the  Rule 404(b)  issue\n\ncould have  been definitively  resolved here and  an adequate\n     \n\nrecord developed, such did not occur.  The government's offer\n\nof  proof only  outlined the  anticipated testimony  from the\n\nBoston officer in generalized  fashion, providing few details\n\nconcerning the second robbery.8   Defendant never requested a\n\nvoir  dire.   See  Griffin, 818  F.2d  at 105  (\"counsel  may\n                          \n\n                    \n\n7.  The  fact   that  defendant's  decision  not  to  testify\nresulted in  that evidence  not being introduced  was nothing\nmore  than happenstance,  stemming solely  from the  parties'\nlast-minute agreement.  \n\n8.  The Court  in Luce held that an offer of proof was not an\n                      \nacceptable   substitute   for  actual   testimony,   since  a\ndefendant's  \"trial   testimony  could,  for  any  number  of\nreasons,  differ  from the  proffer.\"   469  U.S. at  41 n.5.\nGiven  the  limited  and  specific nature  of  the  testimony\nexpected from the  Boston officer, one might  argue that this\nconcern is  of less weight here.  Cf. Ortiz, 857 F.2d at 906-\n                                           \n07  (Pierce, J., concurring) (rejecting applicability of Luce\n                                                             \nbecause,  unlike   the  anticipated  testimony   there,  \"the\ndistrict court could, prospectively,  have reviewed what  the\n                    \ndefense counsel's  arguments would have been,  and could have\nheld the  defense counsel  to those proffers  of argument.\").\nWe need not decide  this issue, since the proffer  here lacks\nsufficient details to permit meaningful review in any event.\n\n                             -11-\n\nrequest that ... the  actual testimony be screened  voir dire\n                                                             \n\nin the  jury's  absence\" in  order  to supply  the  necessary\n\ncontext).   The court was  thus compelled to  make its ruling\n\ncontingent on the Boston's officer's testimony turning out to\n\nbe as described.  On this record, any effort by this court to\n\nreview  the district  court's  balancing  of probative  value\n\nversus  prejudicial   effect  would   be  difficult   if  not\n\nimpossible.  \n\n     Each  of  the  remaining  Luce  factors,   moreover,  is\n                                   \n\ndirectly implicated.   The district court  might have altered\n\nits  ruling upon hearing the Boston officer's testimony.  The\n\ngovernment  might have  elected independently  to  forgo such\n\nevidence,   given  the   strength   of  its   case.     Other\n\nconsiderations, such as the prospect of the Rule 609 evidence\n\nbeing  admitted,   might  have  contributed   to  defendant's\n\ndecision not to testify.  And the sparse factual record would\n\nhave  hampered any review  by this court  for harmless error.\n\nAccordingly,  we conclude  that defendant's challenge  to the\n\nRule 404(b)  ruling never  ripened into an  appealable issue.\n\nCf.

The court  imposed the\n\nmaximum of 240 months, and ordered that it  run consecutively\n\nto the  ten-to-twenty year sentence imposed  earlier in state\n\ncourt  for the  Massachusetts bank  robbery.9   Defendant now\n\nargues, as  he did briefly  below, that under  the guidelines\n\nthe federal sentence must run at  least partly in concurrence\n\nwith his  state  sentence.10    In  a  related  argument,  he\n\ncontends that  the court employed an  erroneous offense level\n\nin calculating that a consecutive sentence was warranted.  As\n\nwe  find  this  latter  contention persuasive,  we  need  not\n\naddress the former.  \n\n     Section  5G1.3 addresses the  sentencing of  a defendant\n\nsubject  to an  undischarged term  of imprisonment.11   Three\n\n                    \n\n9.  The state sentencing occurred in April 1990.\n\n10.  His  principal  argument  below  was  that  the  federal\nsentence  should  have  been completely  concurrent  with his\n                                       \nstate sentence.  He has abandoned this contention on appeal.\n\n11.  An  amended  version  of  this section  took  effect  on\nNovember   1,  1991--thirteen   days  prior   to  defendant's\nsentencing.  As he  did below, defendant in his  brief relies\non  the  earlier version,  without mentioning  such revision.\nYet, the amended version of   5G1.3 does not adversely affect\ndefendant's sentencing; indeed, it lends some strength to the\narguments  he advances  here.   As  such,  no ex  post  facto\n                                                             \nconcerns  arise, and the amended version governs.

Section 5G1.2(b), in turn, provides that\n   \n\n\"the  sentence imposed ...  shall be the  total punishment as\n\ndetermined in accordance with  Part D of Chapter Three  ....\"\n\nAnd     5G1.2(d)  provides  that  consecutive  sentences  are\n\npermissible  \"only  to  the  extent necessary  to  produce  a\n\ncombined sentence equal to the total punishment.\"12  \n\n     The district  court determined that, had  both robberies\n\nbeen   considered  together   for  purposes   of  sentencing,\n\n                    \n\n12.  Section 5G1.2(d) reads in full as follows: \n\n     If the  sentence imposed on the  count carrying the\n     highest statutory  maximum is  less than  the total\n     punishment, then  the sentence  imposed  on one  or\n     more of the  other counts shall run  consecutively,\n     but  only  to the  extent  necessary  to produce  a\n     combined  sentence equal  to the  total punishment.\n     In all other respects sentences on all counts shall\n     run  concurrently, except  to the  extent otherwise\n     required by law.\n\n                             -15-\n\ndefendant would have faced a \"total punishment\" of 262 to 327\n\nmonths.   It reached  this conclusion in  part by calculating\n\nthat, under   3D1.4 (which  provides for the determination of\n\na  combined  offense  level  for multiple  counts),  the  two\n\nrobberies  would   have  led  to  a   two-level  increase  in\n\ndefendant's offense  level.  The court  applied this increase\n\nto  the career  offender level  of 32  derived from    4B1.1,\n\nresulting in  an offense level of  34.  (A level of  34 and a\n\ncriminal   history  category  of   VI  yields  the  indicated\n\nsentencing  range.)    Defendant   now  argues  that  it  was\n\ninappropriate to apply the two-level increase from   3D1.4(a)\n\nto the career offender level derived from   4B1.1.\n\n     Defendant is  correct in this regard,  as the government\n\neffectively  concedes.  Section  4B1.1 specifically provides:\n\n\"If  the offense level for  a career criminal  from the table\n\nbelow is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable,\n\nthe  offense level from the  table below shall  apply.\"  This\n\ndirective makes  clear that  \"the  career offender  guideline\n\nsupersede[s]  the  'otherwise  applicable   offense  level.'\"\n\nUnited States v.

No other such adjustments\nderiving from Chapter Three have been authorized.\n\n                             -17-\n\n588 (7th  Cir.), cert. denied,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It\n\nreasons  as follows.    (1) Without  the two-level  increase,\n\ndefendant's offense  level  would be  32.   With  a  criminal\n\nhistory category of  VI, he  thus would have  faced a  \"total\n\npunishment\"  of  210-262  months  had  both  robberies   been\n\nconsidered together.   (2)  As the two  sentences now  stand,\n\ndefendant could end up serving a combined total of  as few as\n\n284  months.16   (3) While 284  exceeds 262 (the  high end of\n\n                    \n\n14.  The  fact that    5G1.2(b)  specifically refers  back to\n\"the total punishment as determined in accordance with Part D\nof  Chapter  Three\"  does  not  change  this  result.    That\nreference necessarily encompasses  any additional  adjustment\nfrom   4B1 as well.  The final provision in Part D of Chapter\nThree makes this clear.  Section 3D1.5, entitled \"Determining\nthe Total Punishment,\" reads: \"Use the combined offense level\nto determine the appropriate  sentence in accordance with the\nprovisions of Chapter Five.\"  And the accompanying Commentary\nadds: \"The  combined offense level is  subject to adjustments\nfrom ... Chapter Four, Part B ....\"\n\n15.  The   court's  oversight  was   understandable,  as  the\nmiscalculation was  contained in  the presentence  report and\nwas embraced below by both  the defendant and the government.\nIndeed, it was  advanced by  both parties on  appeal and  was\nadopted  by this  court in the  original decision;  not until\ndefendant  filed his  petition  for rehearing  was the  error\nmentioned.\n\n16.  The  government   calculates  as  follows.     Defendant\nreceived a ten-to-twenty year sentence in state court.  Under\nMass. G.L. c. 127,   129, the Commonwealth deducts twelve and\n\n                             -18-\n\nthe  applicable  sentencing  range  had both  robberies  been\n\nconsidered  together),  it is  close  enough  to satisfy  the\n\nguidelines.  For as noted above, the guidelines only call for\n\na  sentence  that \"approximates\"  the  total punishment  that\n\nwould have been imposed, \"to the extent practicable.\"\n\n     We  need  not address  the  validity  of these  specific\n\ncontentions, as we conclude that a remand for resentencing is\n\nappropriate in any event.   In the original opinion  we noted\n\nthat  (again  due  largely  to the  parties'  oversight)  the\n\ndistrict court failed to employ the  methodology set forth in\n\nthe applicable version  of    5G1.3 in deciding  to impose  a\n\nconsecutive  sentence.    We   think  that  this   additional\n\nshortcoming, when combined  with the erroneous  offense-level\n\ncalculation, suffices  under the  circumstances to  warrant a\n\nremand.  We intimate no view as to the appropriateness of (1)\n\nany specific sentence  to be imposed upon resentencing or (2)\n\nany  upward or  downward  departure that  either party  might\n\nrequest.\n\n                    \n\none-half  days  from the  sentence  for  each  month of  good\nconduct, meaning that with such credits defendant would serve\nat  most eleven years and nine months.  More important, under\nG.L.  c. 127,   133,  defendant would be  eligible for parole\nafter serving two-thirds of his minimum sentence--i.e., after\n80 months.   As to  the federal sentence,  under 18 U.S.C.   \n3624(b),  defendant would  receive a  54-day credit  for each\nyear  of \"satisfactory  behavior,\"  meaning he  could end  up\nserving  204 months  out  of  the  240  imposed.    For  both\nsentences in conjunction, therefore,  he could end up serving\nas few as 284 months.\n\n                             -19-\n\n     The conviction is affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and\n                                                             \n\nthe case is remanded for resentencing.  \n                                      \n\n                             -20-\n</pre>",
