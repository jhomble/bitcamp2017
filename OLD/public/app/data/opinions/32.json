In   2008,       Professor   Rebecca\n\nLockridge sued her employer, the University of Southern Maine,\n\nclaiming, among other things, three violations of Title VII (42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e et seq.):           (1) gender discrimination (relating to\n\nthe denial of a pay raise); (2) retaliation (relating to the denial\n\nof her request to move to another office); and (3) hostile work\n\nenvironment (relating to various incidents that occurred during her\n\ntenure    at    the    University).       The     district     court,    adopting    a\n\nmagistrate judge's recommendation, granted summary judgment to the\n\nUniversity on all three claims.           Lockridge appeals.           After review,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n               The facts, discussed at length in the magistrate judge's\n\ndecision, Lockridge v. Univ. of Me. Sys., No. 08-146-P-S, 2009 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 38544, at *4-30 (D. Me. Apr. 23, 2009), can be briefly\n\nsummarized.           Because   summary        judgment      was    granted    against\n\nLockridge, we state these facts in the light most favorable to her,\n\ndrawing   all     reasonable    inferences        in   her    favor.      Rathbun   v.\n\nAutozone, Inc., 361 F.3d 62, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n               In 1984, Lockridge began work at the University as an\n\nAssistant Professor of Communication.                  Her position was tenure-\n\ntrack and part of the University's Department of Communications.1\n\n\n     1\n       Sometime in 2003 or 2004, the University decided to combine\nthe Department of Communications and its Media Studies program to\ncreate a new department, the aptly named \"Department of\n\n                                       -2-\n\f          From 1985 to 2008, Lockridge suffered through a number of\n\nincidents at work.    In addition to incidents we will discuss\n\nseparately and in greater detail, the record contains evidence of\n\nthe following:\n\n          In   1985,   a   fellow   professor,    Leonard\n          Shedletsky, made what Lockridge considered to\n          be sexually inappropriate overtures toward her\n          on two separate occasions.      When Lockridge\n          rejected these overtures, Shedletsky began to\n          appear difficult and angry with her. In 1989,\n          in his capacity as a member of a tenure\n          evaluation   committee   assigned   to   review\n          Lockridge,    Shedletsky    recommended    that\n          Lockridge not be granted tenure. Despite his\n          recommendation, Lockridge was ultimately given\n          tenure.\n\n          In 1992, Lockridge became Chair of the\n          Department of Communications.       Shedletsky\n          chafed    under     Lockridge's     authority,\n          frustrating her ability to carry out her\n          responsibilities   as   Chair.     Eventually,\n          Shedletsky requested that the Dean remove\n          Lockridge from her position. During a meeting\n          in 1993, faculty members voted to remove\n          Lockridge as Chair.    Immediately after this\n          meeting, an article entitled \"Accused of\n          Sexual Harassment,\" which had been written by\n          Shedletsky, was placed in Lockridge's on-\n          campus mailbox.\n\n          From 1991 to 2006, Lockridge, during various\n          work-related   activities,  heard  a  fellow\n          professor, Richard West, make at least seven\n          sexually charged \"jokes\" or comments, most\n          concerning either his status/lifestyle as a\n          gay male or his sexual organs.\n\n\n\nCommunications and Media Studies.\" For ease of exposition, and\nbecause it makes no difference in our analysis, we will refer to\nLockridge's department as the Department of Communications\nthroughout this opinion.\n\n                               -3-\n\f           In 2006, Lockridge came up for \"post-tenure\" review.\n\nThis review consisted of professors being evaluated over a four\n\nyear period in three areas:     teaching, service, and scholarship.\n\nProfessors who received a satisfactory rating in all three areas\n\nwere eligible for a pay raise.\n\n           The peer review committee assigned to review Lockridge\n\nrated her scholarship \"unsatisfactory.\"         Not pleased by this,\n\nLockridge wrote a letter to Devinder Malhotra, the Dean of the\n\nCollege of Arts and Sciences, questioning whether there was \"gender\n\nbias at work.\" Malhotra thereafter conducted an independent review\n\nof Lockridge's scholarship and also rated it \"unsatisfactory.\"\n\nMalhotra noted that at the time of Lockridge's review, she had not\n\npublished a book or juried/peer reviewed article in approximately\n\nfourteen years, and that during the four-year review period, she\n\nhad produced only \"four conference presentations and a chapter in\n\na book.\"     Because of this unsatisfactory scholarship rating,\n\nLockridge was denied a pay raise.      Convinced that she was denied a\n\npay raise because she was a woman, Lockridge filed a complaint with\n\nthe Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC) in December 2006.\n\n           Not long after this, in May 2007, the University reviewed\n\na tenured male professor in the Department of Communications,\n\nRussell Kivatisky.    The peer review committee assigned to review\n\nKivatisky,   which   included   Lockridge,    rated   his   scholarship\n\n\"satisfactory\" despite the fact that he had published less than\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fLockridge during the four-year review period.             In reviewing his\n\nscholarship, however, the committee noted that Kivatisky was on a\n\n\"non-scholarly   track     for   evaluation.\"         Non-scholarly       track\n\nprofessors are not expected to produce scholarship at the same rate\n\nas scholarly track professors.\n\n            During this time period, Lockridge, like many faculty\n\nmembers in the Department of Communications, worked out of a\n\nsatellite office on the University's campus.                 These satellite\n\noffices were necessary due to the limited space in the Department's\n\nhub, the Chamberlain Street building.          Sometime in late 2007 or\n\nearly 2008, however, an office in the Chamberlain Street building\n\nbecame available.      Because these offices were desirable -- they\n\nwere located at the Department's center and had direct access to\n\nthe   Department's     administrative     support    staff    --   they   were\n\ntypically   assigned    based    partially   on     seniority.     Lockridge\n\nrequested that she be given the vacant office.                The University\n\ndenied her request.      When explaining the denial to Lockridge in a\n\nletter, Kivatisky, who had become the Department Chair, wrote,\n\n\"given the continuing legal issues2, I want to be particularly\n\nsensitive to the climate in the office and the working environment\n\nof the staff.\" Kivatisky also told Lockridge that, \"Some find your\n\nattitude toward them to be demeaning.        They find this ironic given\n\n\n\n      2\n       The parties appear to agree that Kivatisky was referring to\nthe 2006 administrative complaint filed by Lockridge.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fyour feminist stance . . . .\"      The University later assigned the\n\noffice to a female faculty member less senior than Lockridge.\n\n             In February 2008, Lockridge sued the University in Maine\n\nstate court, claiming, inter alia, gender discrimination (based on\n\nthe denial of a pay raise) and retaliation (based on the denial of\n\nher   office   request).    Lockridge   also   brought   a   hostile   work\n\nenvironment claim, relying on all of the acts discussed above. The\n\nUniversity removed the case to federal court and, in due time,\n\nmoved for summary judgment, which was granted. This appeal ensued.\n\n                                  II.\n\n             We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.     Rodi v. S. New Eng. Sch. of Law, 532 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).     Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, the\n\ndiscovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show\n\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the\n\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"          Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(c).3\n\n                       A. Gender discrimination\n\n             Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against\n\nan employee with respect to her compensation on the basis of\n\n\n      3\n       A \"material\" fact is one \"that might affect the outcome of\nthe suit under the governing law.\"    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is\n\"genuine\" only \"if a reasonable jury could resolve it in favor of\neither party.\"   Santoni v. Potter, 369 F.3d 594, 598 (1st Cir.\n2004) (quoting Basic Controlex Corp., Inc. v. Klockner Moeller\nCorp., 202 F.3d 450, 453 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n                                  -6-\n\fgender.   42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).   Here, Lockridge claims that\n\nthe University denied her a pay raise because she was a woman.\n\n          Because Lockridge failed to proffer any direct evidence\n\nof gender discrimination, her claim is generally governed by the\n\nburden shifting scheme set out by the Supreme Court in McDonnell\n\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).           See Garcia v.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Co., 535 F.3d 23, 31 n.2 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nUnder this scheme, a plaintiff-employee must first establish a\n\nprima facie case of gender discrimination.        Kosereis v. Rhode\n\nIsland, 331 F.3d 207, 212 (1st Cir. 2003).      The elements of the\n\nprima facie case vary according to the nature of the plaintiff's\n\nclaim, but the plaintiff must show, among other things, that she\n\nsuffered an adverse employment action.      Garcia, 535 F.3d 31 n.2.\n\nIf the plaintiff establishes this prima facie case, the burden of\n\nproduction -- but not the burden of persuasion -- shifts to the\n\nemployer, who must articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory\n\nreason for the adverse employment action.    See id.   If the employer\n\ndoes so, the focus shifts back to the plaintiff, who must then\n\nshow, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer's\n\narticulated reason for the adverse employment action is pretextual\n\nand that the true reason for the adverse action is discriminatory.\n\nSmith v. Stratus Computer, 40 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          We will assume for the sake of analysis that Lockridge\n\nhas met her modest burden of establishing a prima facie case.     See\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fGarcia, 535 F.3d at 30-31.      The University, in turn, has met its\n\nburden of production, as it has identified a legitimate, non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for denying Locrkidge a pay raise:                      her\n\nunsatisfactory scholarship.      For purposes of the summary judgment\n\nanalysis, then, the question reduces to whether Lockridge has\n\nidentified evidence that would enable a reasonable jury to find\n\nthat the University's proffered reason is pretextual and that\n\nLockridge was in fact denied the pay raise because she was a woman.\n\nId. at 31.\n\n           Lockridge focuses most of her efforts on exposing the\n\nUniversity's proffered reason as pretextual.           See St. Mary's Honor\n\nCtr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 517 (explaining that \"proving the\n\nemployer's [articulated] reason false becomes part of (and often\n\nconsiderably assists) the greater enterprise of proving that the\n\nreal reason was intentional discrimination\")4.              She proceeds on a\n\ndifferential treatment theory, reasoning that the University's\n\n\"unsatisfactory scholarship\" explanation must be pretextual because\n\nthe University gave a similarly situated male professor, Russell\n\nKivatisky, a satisfactory scholarship rating despite the fact that\n\nhe   published   less   than   she.         See   Garcia,   535   F.3d   at    31\n\n(recognizing that \"[a] plaintiff can demonstrate that an employer's\n\n\n      4\n       Indeed, \"[t]he factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put\nforward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied\nby a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the\nprima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.\" Id.\nat 511.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fstated reasons are pretextual . . . by producing evidence that\n\n[the] plaintiff was treated differently from similarly situated\n\nemployees\").\n\n            But to prove differential treatment at trial, Lockridge\n\nwould need to show that Kivatisky was similarly situated to her \"in\n\nall relevant respects.\"   Id. (quoting Kosereis, 331 F.3d at 214);\n\nConward v. Cambridge Sch. Comm., 171 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(noting that the comparison cases \"must closely resemble one\n\nanother in respect to relevant facts and circumstances\").          She\n\ncannot hope to do so.   At the time of his review, Kivatisky, unlike\n\nLockridge, was on a \"non-scholarly\" track.    Lockridge acknowledged\n\nas much when she, as a member of the peer review committee\n\nevaluating Kivatisky, signed a letter to the Dean which read, \"When\n\nconsidering scholarship, the committee noted that Russ [Kivatisky]\n\nhas been on a 4-4 teaching load for the past two academic years\n\nand, therefore, sets up a non-scholarly track for evaluation.\"\n\n(emphasis    added).    The   difference   between   scholarly   track\n\nprofessors and non-scholarly track professors is material in this\n\ncase.    Non-scholarly track professors are not expected to produce\n\nscholarship at the same rate as scholarly track professors.5\n\n            Lockridge attempts to draw the sting of this letter by\n\ncalling into question the peer review committee's statement that\n\n\n\n     5\n       At no point has Lockridge claimed that non-scholarly track\nprofessors are situated similarly to scholarly track professors.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fKivatisky's \"4-4 teaching load\" put him on a non-scholarly track.\n\nShe notes that, when deposed, the current Department Chair, Dan\n\nPanici, testified that a professor who carries a 4-4 teaching load\n\nis not exempt from scholarship obligations.\n\n            This testimony, however, is not necessarily inconsistent\n\nwith the statement made in the letter.            A professor carrying a 4-4\n\nteaching load may well have minor scholarship obligations that do\n\nnot disqualify the professor from being on a non-scholarly track.\n\nIn any event, even if Panici's testimony does cast some doubt on\n\nthe statement made in the letter, the fact remains that Lockridge\n\nherself   endorsed   this    statement      and    explicitly     acknowledged\n\nKivatisky's different scholarship obligations.                 Though given an\n\nopportunity, she has yet to adequately explain why she did so.6\n\n            Ultimately,     given    the    material     difference    between\n\nKivatisky   and   Lockridge,   and    the   lack    of   any   other   evidence\n\nsuggesting that the University's proffered reason was pretextual,\n\nLockridge's gender discrimination claim (to the extent it is\n\npremised on differential treatment) fails as a matter of law.               See\n\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 149 (2000)\n\n(explaining that judgment as a matter of law is appropriate where\n\n\n     6\n       At oral argument, when asked why Lockridge signed the\nletter, Lockridge's counsel theorized that Lockridge signed it\nbecause of hostile pressures in her work environment. But, because\nhe could not provide any record support for this theory, this\namounts to \"unsupported speculation\" which is insufficient to\nforestall summary judgment.     See Feliciano de la Cruz v. El\nConquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                     -10-\n\f\"there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable\n\njury to find for [a] party on [a particular] issue\").\n\n          In a last gasp effort, Lockridge claims that, at the very\n\nleast, the University had \"mixed motives\" when denying her the pay\n\nraise.   To prevail on a mixed-motive theory of discrimination,\n\nLockridge would need to establish that the decision to deny her a\n\npay raise was at least partially motivated by her status as a\n\nwoman.   Sher v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 488 F.3d 489, 508\n\nn.22 (1st Cir. 2007).     She cannot do so as a matter of law.\n\nAlthough Lockridge claims that the various incidents that occurred\n\nat the University between 1985 and 2006 serve as circumstantial\n\nevidence that the decision to deny her a pay raise was motivated by\n\nher gender, the incidents she identifies have no discernible\n\nconnection to that decision.\n\n                          B.   Retaliation\n\n          Title   VII's   anti-retaliation   provision,   42   U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-3(a), seeks to prevent employers from retaliating against\n\nan employee for attempting to enforce rights under Title VII.\n\nDeCaire v. Mukasey, 530 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2008).       In relevant\n\npart, the retaliation provision makes it illegal \"for an employer\n\nto discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has\n\nopposed any practice made [] unlawful by [this subchapter] . . . or\n\nbecause he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated\n\nin any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\" under\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fthis subchapter.        42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).          Lockridge claims that\n\nafter she filed a discrimination complaint with the MHRC, the\n\nUniversity retaliated against her by denying her request for an\n\noffice in the Chamberlain Street building.\n\n            Lockridge's       retaliation       claim,     like     her    gender\n\ndiscrimination claim, is generally governed by McDonnell Douglas'\n\nburden shifting scheme.         Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,\n\n355 F.3d 6, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2004).              Accordingly, Lockridge must\n\nfirst establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that\n\n(1) she engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) she\n\nsuffered a materially adverse employment action; and (3) the\n\nprotected activity and the adverse employment action were causally\n\nconnected.       Marrero v. Goya of P.R., Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).   The primary dispute in this case is over the second factor,\n\nwhether Lockridge suffered a materially adverse employment action.\n\n            To     be   materially   adverse,    the    challenged     employment\n\naction must be one that could \"'dissuade a reasonable worker from\n\nmaking or supporting a charge of discrimination.'\"                Dixon v. Int'l\n\nBhd. of Police Officers, 504 F.3d 73, 81 (1st Cir. 2007) quoting\n\nBurlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 57 (2006)).\n\nThis   is   an    objective   test    and    \"'should    be   judged    from   the\n\nperspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position,\n\nconsidering all the circumstances.'\"            Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fCo., 548 U.S. at 71 (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services,\n\nInc., 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998)).\n\n            In its decision recommending summary judgment for the\n\nUniversity, the magistrate judge ruled that the denial of an\n\nemployee's request for office space cannot, as a categorical\n\nmatter, be a materially adverse employment action.              We disagree.\n\nAfter Burlington Northern, employment actions are less susceptible\n\nto categorical treatment when it comes to the question of whether\n\nthey are or are not materially adverse.               We think that, under\n\ncertain circumstances, the denial of an employee's request for\n\noffice space could dissuade a reasonable person from making or\n\nsupporting a charge of discrimination.          Indeed, we have previously\n\nconcluded that \"disadvantageous transfers or assignments\" can be\n\nmaterially adverse, although in the context of conditions more\n\nsevere    than   those    attending   the    usual   employee   office   space\n\nrequest.    See Valentin-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla, 447\n\nF.3d 85, 95 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding a totality of assignments,\n\nwhich included a police officer's transfer for an \"unusually long\"\n\nduration to a \"remote and solitary\" duty site that was \"regarded as\n\npunishment\" by officers, to constitute adverse employment action).\n\n            Moving from the general to the specific, the question\n\nbecomes whether the University's denial of Lockridge's particular\n\nrequest    for   office    space   amounted     to   a   materially   adverse\n\nemployment action. In arguing that it did, Lockridge says that the\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fChamberlain Street office that she desired had distinct advantages\n\nover the satellite office she occupied, namely, administrative\n\nsupport,    more    opportunities       for    professional   interaction     and\n\ndevelopment, and better access to information about Department\n\ngoings-ons.       These allegations find some support in the record,\n\nalthough neither very particular nor strong.              Lockridge testified\n\nduring discovery that the lack of administrative support took time\n\naway from her research and writing and that being separated from\n\nfaculty members in the Department hub made her feel \"excluded and\n\nostracized.\" She also entered into evidence an email exchange with\n\nKivatisky    in    which   she   complained      that   her   location   in   the\n\nsatellite office \"excluded [her] from the informal exchanges of\n\ninformation that occur on an impromptu basis with the result that\n\nI often feel uninformed about the structure, curriculum, and\n\ndirection of the Department.\"\n\n            Regardless,     on    the     undisputed     record,   Lockridge's\n\ncontinued location in a satellite office was not unique.                      The\n\nattendant inconveniences may not have been optimal, but neither did\n\nthey affect Lockridge more adversely than they did some of her\n\ncolleagues.   Lockridge herself observes that other faculty members\n\nwithin the Department, including those senior to her such as\n\nShedletsky, were similarly located in satellite offices.                      So,\n\nalthough Lockridge's request for a better office may have been a\n\nreasonable one, the fact remains that the denial left her in no\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fworse a position than that held by similarly situated faculty\n\nmembers.     Under these circumstances, we cannot see how one could\n\nfind that the denial of Lockridge's request could \"dissuade a\n\nreasonable     worker    from    making     or   supporting    a    charge   of\n\ndiscrimination.\"    Burlington Northern, 548 U.S. at 57.\n\n                        C.   Hostile work environment\n\n           \"Title VII's ban on employment practices . . . extends to\n\nsex-based discrimination that creates a hostile or abusive work\n\nenvironment.\"    Billings v. Town of Grafton, 515 F.3d 39, 47 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).     This type of hostile or abusive work environment is\n\ngenerally referred to as \"sexual harassment.\"                 Id.    Lockridge\n\nclaims that, beginning in 1989, she was subjected to a hostile work\n\nenvironment within the Department of Communications.\n\n           To establish a claim of \"hostile work environment sexual\n\nharassment,\" a plaintiff must demonstrate \"that the harassment was\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of\n\nthe plaintiff's employment and create an abusive work environment.\"\n\nForrest v. Brinker Int'l Payroll Co., LP, 511 F.3d 225, 228 (1st\n\nCir. 2007). In support of her claim, Lockridge identifies a number\n\nof incidents that occurred between 1989 and 2008.             These incidents\n\ninclude:   (1) Shedletsky's 1989 recommendation denying her tenure\n\nafter Lockridge's rejection of his alleged sexual overtures; (2)\n\nthe placement of a sexual harassment article in her work inbox in\n\n1993 after she was removed as Department Chair; (3) West's various\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fjokes and comments about sex and sexuality that occurred between\n\n1991 and 2006; (4) the University's decision to deny her a pay\n\nraise in 2006; and (5) the University's decision to deny her\n\nrequest for office space in 2008.\n\n          In its defense, the University argues that Lockridge's\n\nclaim fails as a matter of law because it relies predominantly on\n\nuntimely acts, specifically, acts that occurred before February 22,\n\n2006 (which is as far back as the statute of limitations reaches).\n\nLockridge, although conceding that most of the aforementioned acts\n\nfall outside the limitations period and are integral to her claim,\n\nargues that the \"continuing violation doctrine\" permits her to rely\n\non the untimely acts.     This doctrine, an equitable exception to\n\nTitle VII's statute of limitations, \"allows an employee to seek\n\ndamages for otherwise time-barred allegations if they are deemed\n\npart of an ongoing series of discriminatory acts and there is 'some\n\nviolation within the statute of limitations period that anchors the\n\nearlier claims.'\"   O'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713,\n\n730 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy, 145 F.3d\n\n5, 14 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n          For the continuing violation doctrine to apply, Lockridge\n\nneeds to establish that a discriminatory \"anchoring act\" occurred\n\nwithin the limitations period.    Noviello v. City of Boston, 398\n\nF.3d 76, 86 (1st Cir. 2005).   To qualify as an anchoring act, the\n\ndiscriminatory act must \"substantially relate[] to [the] earlier\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fincidents of abuse.\"       Id.; Sabree v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &\n\nJoiners   Local   No.    33,   921   F.2d    396,   401    (1st   Cir.   1990).7\n\nLockridge purports to identify two anchoring acts:                the 2006 pay\n\nraise denial and the 2008 office space denial.\n\n            Neither qualifies as an anchoring act.                For reasons\n\nalready discussed, the identified acts are not actionable as a\n\nmatter of law.    Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co. of Am., 101\n\nF.3d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"Common sense teaches that a\n\nplaintiff    cannot     resuscitate    time-barred        acts,   said   to   be\n\ndiscriminatory, by the simple expedient of linking them to a non-\n\nidentical, non-discriminatory, non-time barred act.\") (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n            Our conclusion that Lockridge cannot avail herself of the\n\ncontinuing violation doctrine sounds the death knell for her\n\nhostile work environment claim.         Without reliance on the untimely\n\nevents, the claim fails as a matter of law.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            For the reasons provided above, we affirm the entry of\n\nsummary judgment for the University on all claims.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       In O'Rourke, we explained that a court, when ascertaining\nwhether an anchoring act is \"substantially related\" to an untimely\nact, should ask if the subject matter of the anchoring act is\n\"sufficiently similar\" to that of the untimely act. 235 F.3d at\n731.\n\n                                      -17-\n\f",

The district court, adopting a magistrate judge's recommendation, granted summary judgment to the University on all three claims. Lockridge appeals. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The facts, discussed at length in the magistrate judge's decision, <i>Lockridge v. Univ. of Me. Sys.,</i> No. 08-146-P-S, 2009 WL 1106529, *1-11, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38544, at *4-30 (D.Me. April 23, 2009), can be briefly summarized. Because summary judgment was granted against Lockridge, we state these facts in the light most favorable to her, drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor. <i>Rathbun v. Autozone, Inc.,</i> 361 F.3d 62, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p>In 1984, Lockridge began work at the University as an Assistant Professor of Communication. Her position was tenure-track and part of the University's Department of Communications.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>From 1985 to 2008, Lockridge suffered through a number of incidents at work. In addition to incidents we will discuss separately and in greater detail, the record contains evidence of the following:</p>\n<blockquote>In 1985, a fellow professor, Leonard Shedletsky, made what Lockridge considered to be sexually inappropriate overtures toward her on two separate occasions. When Lockridge rejected these overtures, Shedletsky began to appear difficult and angry with her. In 1989, in his capacity as a member of a tenure evaluation committee assigned to review Lockridge, Shedletsky recommended that Lockridge not be granted tenure. Despite his recommendation, Lockridge was ultimately given tenure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In 1992, Lockridge became Chair of the Department of Communications. Shedletsky chafed under Lockridge's authority, frustrating her ability to carry out her responsibilities as Chair. Eventually, Shedletsky requested that the Dean remove Lockridge from her position. During a meeting in 1993, faculty members voted to remove Lockridge as Chair. Immediately after this meeting, an article entitled \"Accused of Sexual Harassment,\" which had been written by Shedletsky, was placed in Lockridge's on-campus mailbox.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>From 1991 to 2006, Lockridge, during various work-related activities, heard a fellow professor, Richard West, make at least seven sexually charged \"jokes\" or comments, most concerning either his status/lifestyle as a gay male or his sexual organs.</blockquote>\n<p>In 2006, Lockridge came up for \"post-tenure\" review. This review consisted of professors being evaluated over a four year period in three areas: teaching, service, and scholarship. Professors who received a satisfactory rating in all three areas were eligible for a pay raise.</p>\n<p>The peer review committee assigned to review Lockridge rated her scholarship \"unsatisfactory.\" Not pleased by this, Lockridge wrote a letter to Devinder Malhotra, the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, questioning whether there was \"gender bias at work.\" Malhotra thereafter conducted an independent review of Lockridge's scholarship and also rated it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> \"unsatisfactory.\" Malhotra noted that at the time of Lockridge's review, she had not published a book or juried/peer reviewed article in approximately fourteen years, and that during the four-year review period, she had produced only \"four conference presentations and a chapter in a book.\" Because of this unsatisfactory scholarship rating, Lockridge was denied a pay raise. Convinced that she was denied a pay raise because she was a woman, Lockridge filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC) in December 2006.</p>\n<p>Not long after this, in May 2007, the University reviewed a tenured male professor in the Department of Communications, Russell Kivatisky. The peer review committee assigned to review Kivatisky, which included Lockridge, rated his scholarship \"satisfactory\" despite the fact that he had published less than Lockridge during the four-year review period. In reviewing his scholarship, however, the committee noted that Kivatisky was on a \"non-scholarly track for evaluation.\" Non-scholarly track professors are not expected to produce scholarship at the same rate as scholarly track professors.</p>\n<p>During this time period, Lockridge, like many faculty members in the Department of Communications, worked out of a satellite office on the University's campus. These satellite offices were necessary due to the limited space in the Department's hub, the Chamberlain Street building. Sometime in late 2007 or early 2008, however, an office in the Chamberlain Street building became available. Because these offices were desirablethey were located at the Department's center and had direct access to the Department's administrative support staffthey were typically assigned based partially on seniority. Lockridge requested that she be given the vacant office. The University denied her request. When explaining the denial to Lockridge in a letter, Kivatisky, who had become the Department Chair, wrote, \"given the continuing legal issues<sup>[2]</sup>, I want to be particularly sensitive to the climate in the office and the working environment of the staff.\" Kivatisky also told Lockridge that, \"Some find your attitude toward them to be demeaning. They find this ironic given your feminist stance. . . .\" The University later assigned the office to a female faculty member less senior than Lockridge.</p>\n<p>In February 2008, Lockridge sued the University in Maine state court, claiming, inter alia, gender discrimination (based on the denial of a pay raise) and retaliation (based on the denial of her office request). Lockridge also brought a hostile work environment claim, relying on all of the acts discussed above. The University removed the case to federal court and, in due time, moved for summary judgment, which was granted. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Rodi v. S. New Eng. Sch. of Law,</i> 532 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> A. <i>Gender discrimination</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee with respect to her compensation on the basis of gender. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Here, Lockridge claims that the University denied her a pay raise because she was a woman.</p>\n<p>Because Lockridge failed to proffer any direct evidence of gender discrimination, her claim is generally governed by the burden shifting scheme set out by the Supreme Court in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <i>See </i><i>Garcia v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,</i> 535 F.3d 23, 31 n. 2 (1st Cir.2008). Under this scheme, a plaintiff-employee must first establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination. <i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> 331 F.3d 207, 212 (1st Cir.2003). The elements of the prima facie case vary according to the nature of the plaintiff's claim, but the plaintiff must show, among other things, that she suffered an adverse employment action. <i>Garcia,</i> 535 F.3d at 31 n. 2. If the plaintiff establishes this prima facie case, the burden of productionbut not the burden of persuasionshifts to the employer, who must articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <i>See id.</i> If the employer does so, the focus shifts back to the plaintiff, who must then show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is pretextual and that the true reason for the adverse action is discriminatory. <i>Smith v. Stratus Computer,</i> 40 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>We will assume for the sake of analysis that Lockridge has met her modest burden of establishing a prima facie case. <i>See </i><i>Garcia,</i> 535 F.3d at 30-31. The University, in turn, has met its burden of production, as it has identified a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying Lockridge a pay raise: her unsatisfactory scholarship. For purposes of the summary judgment analysis, then, the question reduces to whether Lockridge has identified evidence that would enable a reasonable jury to find that the University's proffered reason is pretextual and that Lockridge was in fact denied the pay raise because she was a woman. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n<p>Lockridge focuses most of her efforts on exposing the University's proffered reason as pretextual. <i>See </i><i>St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks,</i> 509 U.S. 502, 517, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (explaining that \"proving the employer's [articulated] reason false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination\")<sup>[4]</sup>. She proceeds on a differential treatment theory, reasoning that the University's \"unsatisfactory scholarship\" explanation must be pretextual because the University gave a similarly situated male professor, Russell Kivatisky, a satisfactory scholarship rating despite the fact that he published less than she. <i>See </i><i>Garcia,</i> 535 F.3d at 31 (recognizing that \"[a] plaintiff can demonstrate that an employer's stated reasons are pretextual. . . by producing evidence that [the] plaintiff was treated differently from similarly situated employees\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> But to prove differential treatment at trial, Lockridge would need to show that Kivatisky was similarly situated to her \"in all relevant respects.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Kosereis,</i> 331 F.3d at 214); <i>Conward v. Cambridge Sch. Comm.,</i> 171 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that the comparison cases \"must closely resemble one another in respect to relevant facts and circumstances\"). She cannot hope to do so. At the time of his review, Kivatisky, unlike Lockridge, was on a \"non-scholarly\" track. Lockridge acknowledged as much when she, as a member of the peer review committee evaluating Kivatisky, signed a letter to the Dean which read, \"When considering scholarship, the committee noted that Russ [Kivatisky] has been on a 4-4 teaching load for the past two academic years and, therefore, sets up a <i>non-scholarly track</i> for evaluation.\" (emphasis added). The difference between scholarly track professors and non-scholarly track professors is material in this case. Non-scholarly track professors are not expected to produce scholarship at the same rate as scholarly track professors.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Lockridge attempts to draw the sting of this letter by calling into question the peer review committee's statement that Kivatisky's \"4-4 teaching load\" put him on a non-scholarly track. She notes that, when deposed, the current Department Chair, Dan Panici, testified that a professor who carries a 4-4 teaching load is not exempt from scholarship obligations.</p>\n<p>This testimony, however, is not necessarily inconsistent with the statement made in the letter. A professor carrying a 4-4 teaching load may well have minor scholarship obligations that do not disqualify the professor from being on a non-scholarly track. In any event, even if Panici's testimony does cast some doubt on the statement made in the letter, the fact remains that Lockridge herself endorsed this statement and explicitly acknowledged Kivatisky's different scholarship obligations. Though given an opportunity, she has yet to adequately explain why she did so.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Ultimately, given the material difference between Kivatisky and Lockridge, and the lack of any other evidence suggesting that the University's proffered reason was pretextual, Lockridge's gender discrimination claim (to the extent it is premised on differential treatment) fails as a matter of law. <i>See </i><i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 149, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (explaining that judgment as a matter of law is appropriate where \"there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [a] party on [a particular] issue\").</p>\n<p>In a last gasp effort, Lockridge claims that, at the very least, the University had \"mixed motives\" when denying her the pay raise. To prevail on a mixed-motive theory of discrimination, Lockridge would need to establish that the decision to deny her a pay raise was at least partially motivated by her status as a woman. <i>Sher v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> 488 F.3d 489, 508 n. 22 (1st Cir.2007). She cannot do so as a matter of law. Although Lockridge claims that the various incidents that occurred at the University between 1985 and 2006 serve as circumstantial evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> that the decision to deny her a pay raise was motivated by her gender, the incidents she identifies have no discernible connection to that decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Retaliation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Title VII's anti-retaliation provision, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), seeks to prevent employers from retaliating against an employee for attempting to enforce rights under Title VII. <i>DeCaire v. Mukasey,</i> 530 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2008). In relevant part, the retaliation provision makes it illegal \"for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has opposed any practice made [] unlawful by [this subchapter] . . . or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\" under this subchapter. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Lockridge claims that after she filed a discrimination complaint with the MHRC, the University retaliated against her by denying her request for an office in the Chamberlain Street building.</p>\n<p>Lockridge's retaliation claim, like her gender discrimination claim, is generally governed by <i>McDonnell Douglas</i>' burden shifting scheme. <i>Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 355 F.3d 6, 25-26 (1st Cir.2004). Accordingly, Lockridge must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that (1) she engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered a materially adverse employment action; and (3) the protected activity and the adverse employment action were causally connected. <i>Marrero v. Goya of P.R., Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 22 (1st Cir.2002). The primary dispute in this case is over the second factor, whether Lockridge suffered a materially adverse employment action.</p>\n<p>To be materially adverse, the challenged employment action must be one that could \"`dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.'\" <i>Dixon v. Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers,</i> 504 F.3d 73, 81 (1st Cir. 2007) quoting <i>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White,</i> 548 U.S. 53, 57, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). This is an objective test and \"`should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering all the circumstances.'\" <i>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co.,</i> 548 U.S. at 71, 126 S.Ct. 2405 (quoting <i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998)).</p>\n<p>In its decision recommending summary judgment for the University, the magistrate judge ruled that the denial of an employee's request for office space cannot, as a categorical matter, be a materially adverse employment action. We disagree. After <i>Burlington Northern,</i> employment actions are less susceptible to categorical treatment when it comes to the question of whether they are or are not materially adverse. We think that, under certain circumstances, the denial of an employee's request for office space could dissuade a reasonable person from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. Indeed, we have previously concluded that \"disadvantageous transfers or assignments\" can be materially adverse, although in the context of conditions more severe than those attending the usual employee office space request. <i>See </i><i>Valentin-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla,</i> 447 F.3d 85, 95 (1st Cir.2006) (finding a totality of assignments, which included a police officer's transfer for an \"unusually long\" duration to a \"remote and solitary\" duty site that was \"regarded as punishment\" by officers, to constitute adverse employment action).</p>\n<p>Moving from the general to the specific, the question becomes whether the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> University's denial of Lockridge's particular request for office space amounted to a materially adverse employment action. In arguing that it did, Lockridge says that the Chamberlain Street office that she desired had distinct advantages over the satellite office she occupied, namely, administrative support, more opportunities for professional interaction and development, and better access to information about Department goings-ons. These allegations find some support in the record, although neither very particular nor strong. Lockridge testified during discovery that the lack of administrative support took time away from her research and writing and that being separated from faculty members in the Department hub made her feel \"excluded and ostracized.\" She also entered into evidence an email exchange with Kivatisky in which she complained that her location in the satellite office \"excluded [her] from the informal exchanges of information that occur on an impromptu basis with the result that I often feel uninformed about the structure, curriculum, and direction of the Department.\"</p>\n<p>Regardless, on the undisputed record, Lockridge's continued location in a satellite office was not unique. The attendant inconveniences may not have been optimal, but neither did they affect Lockridge more adversely than they did some of her colleagues. Lockridge herself observes that other faculty members within the Department, including those senior to her such as Shedletsky, were similarly located in satellite offices. So, although Lockridge's request for a better office may have been a reasonable one, the fact remains that the denial left her in no worse a position than that held by similarly situated faculty members. Under these circumstances, we cannot see how one could find that the denial of Lockridge's request could \"dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\" <i>Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 57, 126 S.Ct. 2405.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Hostile work environment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>\"Title VII's ban on employment practices . . . extends to sex-based discrimination that creates a hostile or abusive work environment.\" <i>Billings v. Town of Grafton,</i> 515 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir.2008). This type of hostile or abusive work environment is generally referred to as \"sexual harassment.\" <i>Id.</i> Lockridge claims that, beginning in 1989, she was subjected to a hostile work environment within the Department of Communications.</p>\n<p>To establish a claim of \"hostile work environment sexual harassment,\" a plaintiff must demonstrate \"that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of the plaintiff's employment and create an abusive work environment.\" <i>Forrest v. Brinker Int'l Payroll Co., LP,</i> 511 F.3d 225, 228 (1st Cir.2007). In support of her claim, Lockridge identifies a number of incidents that occurred between 1989 and 2008. These incidents include: (1) Shedletsky's 1989 recommendation denying her tenure after Lockridge's rejection of his alleged sexual overtures; (2) the placement of a sexual harassment article in her work inbox in 1993 after she was removed as Department Chair; (3) West's various jokes and comments about sex and sexuality that occurred between 1991 and 2006; (4) the University's decision to deny her a pay raise in 2006; and (5) the University's decision to deny her request for office space in 2008.</p>\n<p>In its defense, the University argues that Lockridge's claim fails as a matter of law because it relies predominantly on untimely acts, specifically, acts that occurred before February 22, 2006 (which is as far back as the statute of limitations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> reaches). Lockridge, although conceding that most of the aforementioned acts fall outside the limitations period and are integral to her claim, argues that the \"continuing violation doctrine\" permits her to rely on the untimely acts. This doctrine, an equitable exception to Title VII's statute of limitations, \"allows an employee to seek damages for otherwise time-barred allegations if they are deemed part of an ongoing series of discriminatory acts and there is `some violation within the statute of limitations period that anchors the earlier claims.'\" <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713, 730 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy,</i> 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p>For the continuing violation doctrine to apply, Lockridge needs to establish that a discriminatory \"anchoring act\" occurred within the limitations period. <i>Noviello v. City of Boston,</i> 398 F.3d 76, 86 (1st Cir.2005). To qualify as an anchoring act, the discriminatory act must \"substantially relate[] to [the] earlier incidents of abuse.\" <i>Id.; </i><i>Sabree v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners Local No. 33,</i> 921 F.2d 396, 401 (1st Cir.1990).<sup>[7]</sup> Lockridge purports to identify two anchoring acts: the 2006 pay raise denial and the 2008 office space denial.</p>\n<p>Neither qualifies as an anchoring act. For reasons already discussed, the identified acts are not actionable as a matter of law. <i>Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co. of Am.,</i> 101 F.3d 218, 222 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Common sense teaches that a plaintiff cannot resuscitate time-barred acts, said to be discriminatory, by the simple expedient of linking them to a non-identical, <i>non-discriminatory,</i> non-time barred act.\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that Lockridge cannot avail herself of the continuing violation doctrine sounds the death knell for her hostile work environment claim. Without reliance on the untimely events, the claim fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons provided above, we <i>affirm</i> the entry of summary judgment for the University on all claims.</p>\n<p>Affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Sometime in 2003 or 2004, the University decided to combine the Department of Communications and its Media Studies program to create a new department, the aptly named \"Department of Communications and Media Studies.\" For ease of exposition, and because it makes no difference in our analysis, we will refer to Lockridge's department as the Department of Communications throughout this opinion.</p>\n<p>[2]  The parties appear to agree that Kivatisky was referring to the 2006 administrative complaint filed by Lockridge.</p>\n<p>[3]  A \"material\" fact is one \"that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\" <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is \"genuine\" only \"if a reasonable jury could resolve it in favor of either party.\" <i>Santoni v. Potter,</i> 369 F.3d 594, 598 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Basic Controlex Corp., Inc. v. Klockner Moeller Corp.,</i> 202 F.3d 450, 453 (1st Cir. 2000)).</p>\n<p>[4]  Indeed, \"[t]he factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742.</p>\n<p>[5]  At no point has Lockridge claimed that nonscholarly track professors are situated similarly to scholarly track professors.</p>\n<p>[6]  At oral argument, when asked why Lockridge signed the letter, Lockridge's counsel theorized that Lockridge signed it because of hostile pressures in her work environment. But, because he could not provide any record support for this theory, this amounts to \"unsupported speculation\" which is insufficient to forestall summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Feliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort &amp; Country Club,</i> 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>[7]  In <i>O'Rourke,</i> we explained that a court, when ascertaining whether an anchoring act is \"substantially related\" to an untimely act, should ask if the subject matter of the anchoring act is \"sufficiently similar\" to that of the untimely act. 235 F.3d at 731.</p>\n\n</div>",

The district court, adopting a magistrate judge's recommendation, granted summary judgment to the University on all three claims. Lockridge appeals. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The facts, discussed at length in the magistrate judge's decision, <i>Lockridge v. Univ. of Me.

Because summary judgment was granted against Lockridge, we state these facts in the light most favorable to her, drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor. <i>Rathbun v.

Her position was tenure-track and part of the University's Department of Communications.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>From 1985 to 2008, Lockridge suffered through a number of incidents at work. In addition to incidents we will discuss separately and in greater detail, the record contains evidence of the following:</p>\n<blockquote>In 1985, a fellow professor, Leonard Shedletsky, made what Lockridge considered to be sexually inappropriate overtures toward her on two separate occasions. When Lockridge rejected these overtures, Shedletsky began to appear difficult and angry with her. In 1989, in his capacity as a member of a tenure evaluation committee assigned to review Lockridge, Shedletsky recommended that Lockridge not be granted tenure. Despite his recommendation, Lockridge was ultimately given tenure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In 1992, Lockridge became Chair of the Department of Communications. Shedletsky chafed under Lockridge's authority, frustrating her ability to carry out her responsibilities as Chair. Eventually, Shedletsky requested that the Dean remove Lockridge from her position. During a meeting in 1993, faculty members voted to remove Lockridge as Chair. Immediately after this meeting, an article entitled \"Accused of Sexual Harassment,\" which had been written by Shedletsky, was placed in Lockridge's on-campus mailbox.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>From 1991 to 2006, Lockridge, during various work-related activities, heard a fellow professor, Richard West, make at least seven sexually charged \"jokes\" or comments, most concerning either his status/lifestyle as a gay male or his sexual organs.</blockquote>\n<p>In 2006, Lockridge came up for \"post-tenure\" review. This review consisted of professors being evaluated over a four year period in three areas: teaching, service, and scholarship. Professors who received a satisfactory rating in all three areas were eligible for a pay raise.</p>\n<p>The peer review committee assigned to review Lockridge rated her scholarship \"unsatisfactory.\" Not pleased by this, Lockridge wrote a letter to Devinder Malhotra, the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, questioning whether there was \"gender bias at work.\" Malhotra thereafter conducted an independent review of Lockridge's scholarship and also rated it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> \"unsatisfactory.\" Malhotra noted that at the time of Lockridge's review, she had not published a book or juried/peer reviewed article in approximately fourteen years, and that during the four-year review period, she had produced only \"four conference presentations and a chapter in a book.\" Because of this unsatisfactory scholarship rating, Lockridge was denied a pay raise. Convinced that she was denied a pay raise because she was a woman, Lockridge filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC) in December 2006.</p>\n<p>Not long after this, in May 2007, the University reviewed a tenured male professor in the Department of Communications, Russell Kivatisky. The peer review committee assigned to review Kivatisky, which included Lockridge, rated his scholarship \"satisfactory\" despite the fact that he had published less than Lockridge during the four-year review period. In reviewing his scholarship, however, the committee noted that Kivatisky was on a \"non-scholarly track for evaluation.\" Non-scholarly track professors are not expected to produce scholarship at the same rate as scholarly track professors.</p>\n<p>During this time period, Lockridge, like many faculty members in the Department of Communications, worked out of a satellite office on the University's campus. These satellite offices were necessary due to the limited space in the Department's hub, the Chamberlain Street building. Sometime in late 2007 or early 2008, however, an office in the Chamberlain Street building became available. Because these offices were desirablethey were located at the Department's center and had direct access to the Department's administrative support staffthey were typically assigned based partially on seniority. Lockridge requested that she be given the vacant office. The University denied her request. When explaining the denial to Lockridge in a letter, Kivatisky, who had become the Department Chair, wrote, \"given the continuing legal issues<sup>[2]</sup>, I want to be particularly sensitive to the climate in the office and the working environment of the staff.\" Kivatisky also told Lockridge that, \"Some find your attitude toward them to be demeaning. They find this ironic given your feminist stance. . . .\" The University later assigned the office to a female faculty member less senior than Lockridge.</p>\n<p>In February 2008, Lockridge sued the University in Maine state court, claiming, inter alia, gender discrimination (based on the denial of a pay raise) and retaliation (based on the denial of her office request). Lockridge also brought a hostile work environment claim, relying on all of the acts discussed above. The University removed the case to federal court and, in due time, moved for summary judgment, which was granted. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Rodi v. S. New Eng.

Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> A. <i>Gender discrimination</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee with respect to her compensation on the basis of gender. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Here, Lockridge claims that the University denied her a pay raise because she was a woman.</p>\n<p>Because Lockridge failed to proffer any direct evidence of gender discrimination, her claim is generally governed by the burden shifting scheme set out by the Supreme Court in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under this scheme, a plaintiff-employee must first establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination. <i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200505\"><a href=\"/opinion/200505/kosereis-v-department-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 212 (1st Cir.2003). The elements of the prima facie case vary according to the nature of the plaintiff's claim, but the plaintiff must show, among other things, that she suffered an adverse employment action. <i>Garcia,</i> 535 F.3d at 31 n. 2. If the plaintiff establishes this prima facie case, the burden of productionbut not the burden of persuasionshifts to the employer, who must articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <i>See id.</i> If the employer does so, the focus shifts back to the plaintiff, who must then show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is pretextual and that the true reason for the adverse action is discriminatory. <i>Smith v. Stratus Computer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195745\"><a href=\"/opinion/195745/smith-v-stratus-computers/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>We will assume for the sake of analysis that Lockridge has met her modest burden of establishing a prima facie case. <i>See </i><i>Garcia,</i> 535 F.3d at 30-31. The University, in turn, has met its burden of production, as it has identified a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying Lockridge a pay raise: her unsatisfactory scholarship. For purposes of the summary judgment analysis, then, the question reduces to whether Lockridge has identified evidence that would enable a reasonable jury to find that the University's proffered reason is pretextual and that Lockridge was in fact denied the pay raise because she was a woman. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n<p>Lockridge focuses most of her efforts on exposing the University's proffered reason as pretextual. <i>See </i><i>St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 517, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

She proceeds on a differential treatment theory, reasoning that the University's \"unsatisfactory scholarship\" explanation must be pretextual because the University gave a similarly situated male professor, Russell Kivatisky, a satisfactory scholarship rating despite the fact that he published less than she. <i>See </i><i>Garcia,</i> 535 F.3d at 31 (recognizing that \"[a] plaintiff can demonstrate that an employer's stated reasons are pretextual. . . by producing evidence that [the] plaintiff was treated differently from similarly situated employees\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> But to prove differential treatment at trial, Lockridge would need to show that Kivatisky was similarly situated to her \"in all relevant respects.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Kosereis,</i> 331 F.3d at 214); <i>Conward v. Cambridge Sch. Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762534\"><a href=\"/opinion/762534/thomas-conward-v-the-cambridge-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that the comparison cases \"must closely resemble one another in respect to relevant facts and circumstances\"). She cannot hope to do so. At the time of his review, Kivatisky, unlike Lockridge, was on a \"non-scholarly\" track. Lockridge acknowledged as much when she, as a member of the peer review committee evaluating Kivatisky, signed a letter to the Dean which read, \"When considering scholarship, the committee noted that Russ [Kivatisky] has been on a 4-4 teaching load for the past two academic years and, therefore, sets up a <i>non-scholarly track</i> for evaluation.\" (emphasis added). The difference between scholarly track professors and non-scholarly track professors is material in this case. Non-scholarly track professors are not expected to produce scholarship at the same rate as scholarly track professors.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Lockridge attempts to draw the sting of this letter by calling into question the peer review committee's statement that Kivatisky's \"4-4 teaching load\" put him on a non-scholarly track. She notes that, when deposed, the current Department Chair, Dan Panici, testified that a professor who carries a 4-4 teaching load is not exempt from scholarship obligations.</p>\n<p>This testimony, however, is not necessarily inconsistent with the statement made in the letter. A professor carrying a 4-4 teaching load may well have minor scholarship obligations that do not disqualify the professor from being on a non-scholarly track. In any event, even if Panici's testimony does cast some doubt on the statement made in the letter, the fact remains that Lockridge herself endorsed this statement and explicitly acknowledged Kivatisky's different scholarship obligations. Though given an opportunity, she has yet to adequately explain why she did so.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Ultimately, given the material difference between Kivatisky and Lockridge, and the lack of any other evidence suggesting that the University's proffered reason was pretextual, Lockridge's gender discrimination claim (to the extent it is premised on differential treatment) fails as a matter of law. <i>See </i><i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span> (2000) (explaining that judgment as a matter of law is appropriate where \"there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [a] party on [a particular] issue\").</p>\n<p>In a last gasp effort, Lockridge claims that, at the very least, the University had \"mixed motives\" when denying her the pay raise. To prevail on a mixed-motive theory of discrimination, Lockridge would need to establish that the decision to deny her a pay raise was at least partially motivated by her status as a woman. <i>Sher v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202763\"><a href=\"/opinion/202763/sher-v-us-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 508 n. 22 (1st Cir.2007). She cannot do so as a matter of law. Although Lockridge claims that the various incidents that occurred at the University between 1985 and 2006 serve as circumstantial evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> that the decision to deny her a pay raise was motivated by her gender, the incidents she identifies have no discernible connection to that decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Retaliation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Title VII's anti-retaliation provision, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), seeks to prevent employers from retaliating against an employee for attempting to enforce rights under Title VII. <i>DeCaire v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203386\"><a href=\"/opinion/203386/decaire-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2008). In relevant part, the retaliation provision makes it illegal \"for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has opposed any practice made [] unlawful by [this subchapter] . . . or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\" under this subchapter. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Lockridge claims that after she filed a discrimination complaint with the MHRC, the University retaliated against her by denying her request for an office in the Chamberlain Street building.</p>\n<p>Lockridge's retaliation claim, like her gender discrimination claim, is generally governed by <i>McDonnell Douglas</i>' burden shifting scheme. <i>Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201012\"><a href=\"/opinion/201012/calero-cerezo-v-us-dep-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 25-26 (1st Cir.2004). Accordingly, Lockridge must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that (1) she engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered a materially adverse employment action; and (3) the protected activity and the adverse employment action were causally connected. <i>Marrero v. Goya of P.R., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200103\"><a href=\"/opinion/200103/marrero-v-goya-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2002). The primary dispute in this case is over the second factor, whether Lockridge suffered a materially adverse employment action.</p>\n<p>To be materially adverse, the challenged employment action must be one that could \"`dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.'\" <i>Dixon v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span> (1998)).</p>\n<p>In its decision recommending summary judgment for the University, the magistrate judge ruled that the denial of an employee's request for office space cannot, as a categorical matter, be a materially adverse employment action. We disagree. After <i>Burlington Northern,</i> employment actions are less susceptible to categorical treatment when it comes to the question of whether they are or are not materially adverse. We think that, under certain circumstances, the denial of an employee's request for office space could dissuade a reasonable person from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. Indeed, we have previously concluded that \"disadvantageous transfers or assignments\" can be materially adverse, although in the context of conditions more severe than those attending the usual employee office space request. <i>See </i><i>Valentin-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202202\"><a href=\"/opinion/202202/valentin-v-mun-of-aquadilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir.2006) (finding a totality of assignments, which included a police officer's transfer for an \"unusually long\" duration to a \"remote and solitary\" duty site that was \"regarded as punishment\" by officers, to constitute adverse employment action).</p>\n<p>Moving from the general to the specific, the question becomes whether the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> University's denial of Lockridge's particular request for office space amounted to a materially adverse employment action. In arguing that it did, Lockridge says that the Chamberlain Street office that she desired had distinct advantages over the satellite office she occupied, namely, administrative support, more opportunities for professional interaction and development, and better access to information about Department goings-ons. These allegations find some support in the record, although neither very particular nor strong. Lockridge testified during discovery that the lack of administrative support took time away from her research and writing and that being separated from faculty members in the Department hub made her feel \"excluded and ostracized.\" She also entered into evidence an email exchange with Kivatisky in which she complained that her location in the satellite office \"excluded [her] from the informal exchanges of information that occur on an impromptu basis with the result that I often feel uninformed about the structure, curriculum, and direction of the Department.\"</p>\n<p>Regardless, on the undisputed record, Lockridge's continued location in a satellite office was not unique. The attendant inconveniences may not have been optimal, but neither did they affect Lockridge more adversely than they did some of her colleagues. Lockridge herself observes that other faculty members within the Department, including those senior to her such as Shedletsky, were similarly located in satellite offices. So, although Lockridge's request for a better office may have been a reasonable one, the fact remains that the denial left her in no worse a position than that held by similarly situated faculty members. Under these circumstances, we cannot see how one could find that the denial of Lockridge's request could \"dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\" <i>Burlington Northern,</i> 548 U.S. at 57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Town of Grafton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203138\"><a href=\"/opinion/203138/billings-v-town-of-grafton/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2008). This type of hostile or abusive work environment is generally referred to as \"sexual harassment.\" <i>Id.</i> Lockridge claims that, beginning in 1989, she was subjected to a hostile work environment within the Department of Communications.</p>\n<p>To establish a claim of \"hostile work environment sexual harassment,\" a plaintiff must demonstrate \"that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of the plaintiff's employment and create an abusive work environment.\" <i>Forrest v. Brinker Int'l Payroll Co., LP,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203078\"><a href=\"/opinion/203078/forrest-v-brinker-intern-payroll-co-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 228 (1st Cir.2007). In support of her claim, Lockridge identifies a number of incidents that occurred between 1989 and 2008. These incidents include: (1) Shedletsky's 1989 recommendation denying her tenure after Lockridge's rejection of his alleged sexual overtures; (2) the placement of a sexual harassment article in her work inbox in 1993 after she was removed as Department Chair; (3) West's various jokes and comments about sex and sexuality that occurred between 1991 and 2006; (4) the University's decision to deny her a pay raise in 2006; and (5) the University's decision to deny her request for office space in 2008.</p>\n<p>In its defense, the University argues that Lockridge's claim fails as a matter of law because it relies predominantly on untimely acts, specifically, acts that occurred before February 22, 2006 (which is as far back as the statute of limitations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> reaches). Lockridge, although conceding that most of the aforementioned acts fall outside the limitations period and are integral to her claim, argues that the \"continuing violation doctrine\" permits her to rely on the untimely acts. This doctrine, an equitable exception to Title VII's statute of limitations, \"allows an employee to seek damages for otherwise time-barred allegations if they are deemed part of an ongoing series of discriminatory acts and there is `some violation within the statute of limitations period that anchors the earlier claims.'\" <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771503\"><a href=\"/opinion/771503/julia-m-orourke-v-city-of-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 730 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Provencher v.

For reasons already discussed, the identified acts are not actionable as a matter of law. <i>Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur.
