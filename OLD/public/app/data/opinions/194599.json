The  National Labor  Relations Board  has\n                \n\npetitioned   to   enforce   its   order   against  respondent\n\nLindenmeyr/Munroe, a division  of Central National Gottesman,\n\nInc.  (\"the  company\").   The  order directs  the  company to\n\nbargain with  Local 504  of the International  Brotherhood of\n\nTeamsters,  Chauffeurs, Warehousemen  and Helpers  of America\n\n(\"the  union\").  Agreeing that  the order is  valid, we order\n\nits enforcement.\n\n     Lindenmeyr/Munroe  operates  a  warehouse in  Mansfield,\n\nMassachusetts, from which it distributes paper products.  The\n\ncompany hired Donald Dooley on April  1, 1986 to serve as the\n\nnight shift  foreman.  On  March 28, 1989, the  union filed a\n\npetition  with the Board seeking  to represent a  unit of the\n\ncompany's warehouse employees.  The Board's Regional Director\n\nissued a  direction of election  on May 10,  1989, permitting\n\nDooley  to vote as an employee subject to the company's claim\n\nthat he  was  a \"supervisor\"  within the  meaning of  section\n\n2(11)  of  the  National Labor  Relations  Act,  29  U.S.C.  \n\n152(11).\n\n     The Board conducted the election on June 8, 1989.  Aside\n\nfrom Dooley's vote, the  tally of unchallenged ballots showed\n\neight  votes  for  the  company  and  eight  for  the  union.\n\nDooley's ballot  (which favored  the union) was  the deciding\n\nvote.   The Board's Regional Director  then ordered a hearing\n\nto be conducted before an administrative law judge to resolve\n\n                             -3-\n\nthe issue of Dooley's  status.  The administrative  law judge\n\nconducted  the  hearing, determined  that  Dooley  was not  a\n\nsupervisor,  and  directed  that  his ballot  be  opened  and\n\ncounted.  The  Board adopted the  recommended order, and  the\n\nRegional Director  thereafter certified  the union.   On June\n\n21,  1991,   the  union   requested  the  company   to  begin\n\nbargaining.      The   company   refused,   citing   improper\n\ncertification of the bargaining unit as its basis.\n\n     Upon the  company's refusal to bargain,  the union filed\n\nan unfair labor  practice charge.   On August  15, 1991,  the\n\nRegional Director  charged  that  the  company  had  violated\n\nsections 8(a)(1) and (5)  of the Act, 29 U.S.C.     158(a)(1)\n\nand  (5).  The company  admitted the refusals  to bargain but\n\nasserted that  the union  was improperly certified  because a\n\ndeterminative  vote was  cast  by a  supervisor.   On summary\n\njudgment, the Board entered an order dated November 26, 1991,\n\nfinding  that the company had violated the Act as charged and\n\nrequiring that it bargain.   Enforcement of the order  is now\n\nsought,  pursuant  to section  10(e)  of the  Act,  29 U.S.C.\n\n160(e).\n\n     The  sole   issue  is  whether  there   is  \"substantial\n\nevidence\" in  the record to justify the  Board's finding that\n\nDooley was not a supervisor.  Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,\n                                                            \n\n340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951).  Section 2(11) of the Act provides:\n\n             The   term   \"supervisor\"  means   any\n          individual   having  authority,   in  the\n\n                             -4-\n\n          interest  of  the   employer,  to   hire,\n          transfer,   suspend,  lay   off,  recall,\n          promote,  discharge,  assign,  reward  or\n          discipline     other     employees,    or\n          responsibly to direct  them, or to adjust\n          their   grievances,  or   effectively  to\n          recommend such action,  if in  connection\n          with the  foregoing the exercise  of such\n          authority is not of  a merely routine  or\n          clerical  nature, but requires the use of\n          independent judgment.\n\nThe  statute is  read in  the  disjunctive.   Any one  of the\n\nenumerated  capabilities can  confer supervisory  status upon\n\nthe individual.  E.g., Maine Yankee Atomic Power v. NLRB, 624\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  347,  360  (1st Cir.  1980).    However, gradations  of\n\nauthority  ranging from \"top executive to `straw boss' are so\n\ninfinite  and subtle  that of  necessity a  large measure  of\n\ninformed discretion is involved in the exercise by the  Board\n\nof its primary function to determine those who as a practical\n\nmatter   fall   within   the   statutory  definition   of   a\n\n`supervisor.'\"   NLRB v. Swift and Company, 292 F.2d 561, 563\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1961).\n\n     In this  case, the  administrative law judge  found that\n\nDooley's work day was \"almost indistinguishable\" from that of\n\nthe  other warehousemen on his shift.  Dooley like the others\n\n\"picked\"  orders  and  loaded   them  on  pallets  for  truck\n\ndelivery.   He  clocked in  and out,  was paid  on an  hourly\n\nbasis,  had no  office or  desk, did  no extra  paperwork and\n\nattended  no management meetings.  Hiring  and firing was the\n\nprovince  of Dooley's  own superiors.   Although  Dooley gave\n\n                             -5-\n\ncertain orders, the administrative law judge found them to be\n\nlimited in scope, mechanical in nature, and involving no real\n\nuse of independent judgment.  The Board could thus reasonably\n\nfind that  Dooley exerted \"the routine exercise  of a skilled\n\nworker's control over  less capable employees, and  was not a\n\nsupervisor sharing  the power of management.\"   Goldies, Inc.\n                                                             \n\nv. NLRB, 628 F.2d 706, 710 (1st Cir. 1980).\n       \n\n     The  company  argues  that  when it  hired  Dooley,  his\n\nsuperiors  described his  authority  to him  in broad  terms,\n\nincluding the power effectively to recommend discipline.  The\n\nadministrative law  judge  found  that  this  description  of\n\nDooley's authority had  been provided to Dooley  \"once upon a\n\ntime,\" but  he also found that Dooley's  actual authority did\n\nnot  correspond to the original description.  While it is the\n\nexistence and not the  exercise of authority that establishes\n\nsupervisory status, NLRB v. Leland-Gifford Co., 200 F.2d 620,\n                                             \n\n625  (1st Cir. 1952), we think that the existence of Dooley's\n\nauthority was reasonably in dispute in this case.\n\n     Specifically,  the administrative  law  judge  found  no\n\nindication   that   Dooley   himself   had   ever   exercised\n\ndisciplinary  authority,  recommended   discipline  or   even\n\nreported any  misbehavior of others to superiors.   There was\n\nno evidence that other workers had ever been told that Dooley\n\nhad such  authority.  Indeed,  while Dooley  could report  or\n\nrecommend  anything  to management,  Dooley  himself observed\n\n                             -6-\n\nthat  \"anybody else could\" too.  The picture painted by these\n\nand  other facts  strongly suggests  that neither  Dooley nor\n\nanyone  else behaved  as if  he had  been entrusted  with any\n\nspecial disciplinary authority.  In sum, the Board's decision\n\nis  a   reasonable  evaluation   of  the  facts   based  upon\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n     The petition for enforcement is granted.\n                                            \n\n                             -7-\n",

However, gradations  of\n\nauthority  ranging from \"top executive to `straw boss' are so\n\ninfinite  and subtle  that of  necessity a  large measure  of\n\ninformed discretion is involved in the exercise by the  Board\n\nof its primary function to determine those who as a practical\n\nmatter   fall   within   the   statutory  definition   of   a\n\n`supervisor.'\"   NLRB v. Swift and Company, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"254600\"><a href=\"/opinion/254600/national-labor-relations-board-v-swift-and-company-dba-new-england/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 563\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1961).\n\n     In this  case, the  administrative law judge  found that\n\nDooley's work day was \"almost indistinguishable\" from that of\n\nthe  other warehousemen on his shift.  Dooley like the others\n\n\"picked\"  orders  and  loaded   them  on  pallets  for  truck\n\ndelivery.   He  clocked in  and out,  was paid  on an  hourly\n\nbasis,  had no  office or  desk, did  no extra  paperwork and\n\nattended  no management meetings.  Hiring  and firing was the\n\nprovince  of Dooley's  own superiors.   Although  Dooley gave\n\n                             -5-\n\ncertain orders, the administrative law judge found them to be\n\nlimited in scope, mechanical in nature, and involving no real\n\nuse of independent judgment.  The Board could thus reasonably\n\nfind that  Dooley exerted \"the routine exercise  of a skilled\n\nworker's control over  less capable employees, and  was not a\n\nsupervisor sharing  the power of management.\"   Goldies, Inc.\n                                                             \n\nv.

The\n\nadministrative law  judge  found  that  this  description  of\n\nDooley's authority had  been provided to Dooley  \"once upon a\n\ntime,\" but  he also found that Dooley's  actual authority did\n\nnot  correspond to the original description.  While it is the\n\nexistence and not the  exercise of authority that establishes\n\nsupervisory status, NLRB v. Leland-Gifford Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"230664\"><a href=\"/opinion/230664/national-labor-relations-board-v-leland-gifford-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                             \n\n625  (1st Cir. 1952), we think that the existence of Dooley's\n\nauthority was reasonably in dispute in this case.\n\n     Specifically,  the administrative  law  judge  found  no\n\nindication   that   Dooley   himself   had   ever   exercised\n\ndisciplinary  authority,  recommended   discipline  or   even\n\nreported any  misbehavior of others to superiors.   There was\n\nno evidence that other workers had ever been told that Dooley\n\nhad such  authority.  Indeed,  while Dooley  could report  or\n\nrecommend  anything  to management,  Dooley  himself observed\n\n                             -6-\n\nthat  \"anybody else could\" too.  The picture painted by these\n\nand  other facts  strongly suggests  that neither  Dooley nor\n\nanyone  else behaved  as if  he had  been entrusted  with any\n\nspecial disciplinary authority.  In sum, the Board's decision\n\nis  a   reasonable  evaluation   of  the  facts   based  upon\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n     The petition for enforcement is granted.\n                                            \n\n                             -7-\n</pre>",
