Plaintiff-appellant,  Massachusetts\n          Per  Curiam.\n                     \n\nLaborers'   District   Council  (Laborers),   and  defendant-\n\nappellee, Labor Relations Division of Construction Industries\n\nof Massachusetts (CIM),  a contractor trade  association, are\n\nparties  to a  collective bargaining  agreement  containing a\n\nprovision   to  arbitrate   unresolved  grievances.     Cardi\n\nCorporation  (Cardi), a  general contractor  and a  member of\n\n(CIM), was a signatory to  that agreement.  Plaintiff  claims\n\nthat Cardi violated the  agreement in two separate instances,\n\non one occasion by subcontracting work to a subcontractor who\n\nused members of  the Ironworkers' Union to perform  work that\n\nLaborers felt belonged to its  members, and then by assigning\n\nwork on another  of its  jobs to members  of the  Carpenters'\n\nUnion rather than to members of the local Laborers affiliate.\n\n          After  the  disputes remained  unresolved, Laborers\n\nsought a  court  order requiring  that  the two  disputes  be\n\narbitrated  in  accordance  with  the  bilateral  arbitration\n\nclause  contained in  the  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement.\n\nUltimately, the district court  ordered the disputing parties\n\nto engage  in tripartite arbitration  with regard to  each of\n\nthe separate work-related disputes.   That order was complied\n\nwith,  and eventually one of the disputes was dropped and the\n\nother settled during arbitration proceedings.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          After  notifying  the court  of  the  resolution of\n\nthese  disputes, Laborers, in  essence, continued  to contend\n\nthat  the   court  had  erred  when   it  ordered  tripartite\n\narbitration.  Notwithstanding  that contention, the  district\n\ncourt, on being advised of the dispositions of the underlying\n\ndisputes,  dismissed the  action  as moot.   Laborers  took a\n\ntimely appeal from that dismissal.  We affirm.\n\n          A   federal   court's  jurisdiction   to  determine\n\ndisputes is limited by  the strictures of Article III  of the\n\nConstitution  to  the  resolution  of  \"real  and substantial\n\ncontrovers[ies] admitting of specific relief through a decree\n\nof  a conclusive  nature,  as distinguished  from an  opinion\n\nadvising what the law  would be upon a hypothetical  state of\n\nfacts.\"  Lewis v.  Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S.  472, 477\n                                         \n\n(1990) (citations omitted).  Thus, as we said in another case\n\ninvolving the \"case or controversy\" requirement:\n\n          the only issue is whether there is now an\n          actual \"case or  controversy\" within  the\n          meaning   of   Article    III   of    the\n          Constitution, or whether, as the district\n          court held, the case  is moot and thus no\n          longer justiciable.   See Sosna  v. Iowa,\n                                                  \n          419  U.S.  393,  397-403  (1975).   Where\n          declaratory  relief is  sought, plaintiff\n          must  show that  there  is a  substantial\n          controversy   over   present  rights   of\n          \"sufficient   immediacy   and    reality\"\n          requiring   adjudication.     Preiser  v.\n                                               \n          Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 402  (1975); Aetna\n                                                   \n          Life Ins.  Co. v.

McCormack, 395\n                                              \n          U.S. 486, 496 (1969)).  \n\nBoston  Teachers Union v.

We  agree with the  district court that this  case is\n\nmoot. \n\n          It  is  beyond  question that  no  current  dispute\n\nexists between the  parties with regard to work assignment or\n\nsubcontracting  practices.  The  original disputes respecting\n\nCardi's  assignment and subcontracting  of work vis-a-vis all\n\nthree unions have  been resolved.   Thus,  once the  district\n\ncourt  was  advised  of  the  resolution  of  the  underlying\n\ndisputes, the order of  dismissal was appropriate because the\n\nonly  relief  plaintiff  had   sought,  an  order  compelling\n\narbitration, was no longer a live issue.\n\n          With  the settlement  of  the underlying  disputes,\n\nthere  remained no further  justiciable case  or controversy.\n\nAlthough the  parties to  this litigation may  still disagree\n\nabout the proper allocation of the disputed work or, for that\n\nmatter,  whether the  district court  should have  joined all\n\nthree  disputing unions  and ordered  tripartite arbitration,\n\nonce  that  order issued,  and the  parties  acted on  it and\n\nresolved their differences,  there remained  nothing for  the\n\ndistrict court to resolve.   \n\n          The  particular disputes  which animated  this case\n\nwill  not occur  again although,  of course,  future disputes\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ninvolving other  work issues  may arise between  employer and\n\nunion.  The resolution  of those disputes will have  to await\n\ntheir occurrence.1\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the order is affirmed.\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n1.  Plaintiff contends for the first  time in its reply brief\nthat  because  this  dispute  is capable  of  repetition  and\nincapable of review, we must now decide whether the  district\ncourt  exceeded  its  authority  when it  ordered  tripartite\narbitration.

We agree with the district court that this case is moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond question that no current dispute exists between the parties with regard to work assignment or subcontracting practices.  The original disputes respecting Cardi's assignment and subcontracting of work vis-a-vis all three unions have been resolved.  Thus, once the district court was advised of the resolution of the underlying disputes, the order of dismissal was appropriate because the only relief plaintiff had sought, an order compelling arbitration, was no longer a live issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the settlement of the underlying disputes, there remained no further justiciable case or controversy.  Although the parties to this litigation may still disagree about the proper allocation of the disputed work or, for that matter, whether the district court should have joined all three disputing unions and ordered tripartite arbitration, once that order issued, and the parties acted on it and resolved their differences, there remained nothing for the district court to resolve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The particular disputes which animated this case will not occur again although, of course, future disputes involving other work issues may arise between employer and union.  The resolution of those disputes will have to await their occurrence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the order is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff contends for the first time in its reply brief that because this dispute is capable of repetition and incapable of review, we must now decide whether the district court exceeded its authority when it ordered tripartite arbitration.  The short answer to this plaint is that issues raised for the first time in a reply brief are deemed waived.   Vanhaaren v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins.
