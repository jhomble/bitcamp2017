Morales  de\n\nCasenave, challenge  the district court's  dismissal of their\n\ncomplaint as  time-barred.

On April 27,\n\n1989,  Mr.  de Casenave  and  his  wife, plaintiff  Maria  de\n\nCasenave,  presented   tort  claims  to  the   United  States\n\ngovernment  based on  this incident.   The  government denied\n\ntheir claims on March 26, 1990, and mailed them the notice of\n\ndenial two  days  later.   On  August  14,  1990,  plaintiffs\n\ncommenced an  action in federal court  against the government\n\nunder  the Federal  Torts Claims  Act (\"FTCA\"), 28  U.S.C.   \n\n1346(b),  2671,  et  seq.,  alleging  that  the  government's\n                         \n\nnegligent  maintenance of  a  sidewalk at  the Naval  Station\n\ncaused his  injuries.   During the  pendency of  that action,\n\nplaintiffs'  counsel failed  to comply with  an order  of the\n\ndistrict  court  (Pieras,  J.)  directing him  to  attend  an\n\ninitial scheduling conference and to file certain  scheduling\n\nmemoranda.    As a  result,  Judge  Pieras found  plaintiffs'\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\ncounsel  in violation  of  Federal Rules  of Civil  Procedure\n\n16(f)  and 37(b)(2), and, in an order dated January 18, 1991,\n\ndismissed the complaint.   See de Casenave  v. United States,\n                                                            \n\nNo.  90-2095(JP), slip  op. at 5  (D.P.R. January  18, 1991).\n\nThe judgment of  dismissal was entered on  January 23, 1991.1\n\nOn March 4, 1991, Judge Pieras denied plaintiffs'  motion for\n\nreconsideration  of that  dismissal,  and on  April 3,  1991,\n\nplaintiffs filed a notice  of appeal.  Subsequently, however,\n\nplaintiffs moved  for a voluntary dismissal  of their appeal,\n\nwhich this court entered on May 28, 1991.\n\n          On July  10, 1991, plaintiff filed  a new complaint\n\nagainst  the  government  which contained  verbatim  the same\n\nallegations  as  the  first  complaint.    In  response,  the\n\ngovernment filed a  motion to dismiss, arguing  that the six-\n\nmonth statute  of limitations  on plaintiffs' FTCA  claim had\n\nrun.  The  district court (Cerezo,  J.) agreed and  dismissed\n\n                    \n\n1.  In his  January 18 order,  Judge Pieras  stated that  the\ndismissal was  \"with prejudice.\"  The  judgment of dismissal,\nhowever, stated that the dismissal was \"without prejudice.\"\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nthe complaint.2   See de  Casenave v. United  States, 797  F.\n                                                    \n\nSupp. 86, 87 (D.P.R. 1992).  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          A FTCA  claimant has six  months from the  date the\n\nfederal agency  mails the notice  of final denial  of her/his\n\nclaim  to  file  suit in  federal  court.   See  28  U.S.C.  \n                                               \n\n2401(b).3  Here, the  government mailed plaintiffs the notice\n\nof final denial of their claim on March 28, 1990.  Plaintiffs\n\nfiled their new lawsuit  more than one year after  the notice\n\nof  denial was mailed.  Thus, the instant complaint was filed\n\nwell outside  the six-month  limitations period.   Plaintiffs\n\n                    \n\n2.  The  district  court  held  that,  because the  six-month\nstatute of limitations was jurisdictional, it had no power to\napply principles  of equitable tolling  to plaintiffs' claim.\nIn  light of the Supreme Court's holding in Irwin v. Veterans\n                                                             \nAdmin.,  498 U.S.  89,    ,  111 S.  Ct. 453,  457-58 (1990),\n      \ndiscussed infra, the  district court's  refusal to  entertain\n               \nplaintiffs'  tolling argument  was  erroneous.    On  appeal,\nhowever, we are  \"free to affirm a  district court's decision\non  any ground supported in the record  even if the issue was\nnot  pleaded,   tried  or   otherwise  referred  to   in  the\nproceedings below.\"  Resare v.

We  have  allowed  equitable  tolling  in\n\nsituations  where  the  claimant  has  actively  pursued  his\n\njudicial remedies  by filing a defective  pleading during the\n\nstatutory period,  or where the complainant  has been induced\n\nor tricked  by his  adversary's misconduct into  allowing the\n\nfiling  deadline  to pass.\")  (footnotes omitted);  Pipkin v.\n                                                          \n\nUnited  States, 951 F.2d 272,  274 (10th Cir. 1991) (refusing\n              \n\nto toll  FTCA six-month  limitations period during  filing of\n\nprevious FTCA lawsuit  which was dismissed  without prejudice\n\nfor failure to prosecute).\n\n          Plaintiffs'  initial lawsuit  was dismissed  due to\n\ntheir counsel's refusal  to abide by the  discovery orders of\n\n                    \n\n4.  Because the facts upon which plaintiffs' tolling argument\nrests are undisputed, we see no reason to remand this case to\nthe district court.  See,  e.g., Societe Des Produits Nestle,\n                                                             \nS.A.  v. Casa  Helvetia, Inc.,  982 F.2d  633, 642  (1st Cir.\n                             \n1992) (using findings  of fact  made in the  framework of  an\nunacceptable legal  analysis to  affirm on a  different legal\ntheory).\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nthe district court.   The  record contains  no evidence  that\n\nplaintiffs were induced  or tricked by any misconduct  on the\n\npart of the government to delay as long as they did in filing\n\nthis lawsuit.5   Rather, this case is  a classic example of a\n\nparty  \"[fail]ing  to  exercise due  diligence  in preserving\n\nhis[/her] legal rights.\"  Irwin, 498 U.S.  at    , 111 S. Ct.\n                               \n\nat 458.   Thus, we discern no basis  under which the district\n\ncourt  could  have  applied  equitable principles  to  rescue\n\nplaintiffs' complaint.  Cf. Pipkin, 951 F.2d at 275 (refusing\n                                  \n\nto toll FTCA six-month  limitations period during pendency of\n\npreviously filed lawsuit).  \n\n          Even if the district court  had decided to toll the\n\nsix-month  limitations period  between  the  time  plaintiffs\n\nfiled  the  first  lawsuit  and  the  time  that  action  was\n\ndismissed, plaintiffs' instant complaint would still be time-\n\nbarred.6   Plaintiffs waited four  months and sixteen days to\n\n                    \n\n5.  At  oral argument,  plaintiffs appeared  to be  asserting\nsome sort  of estoppel theory based on  an alleged discussion\nwith counsel  for the government  during the pendency  of the\nprevious   appeal.     This  theory,  however,   was  neither\narticulated  below  nor  developed  in plaintiffs'  brief  on\nappeal.  As such, we need not address it.  See, e.g., Lafont-\n                                                             \nRivera v. Soler-Zapata,  984 F.2d  1, 3 n.2  (1st Cir.  1993)\n                      \n(refusing  to   address  issue  which  appellant   failed  to\narticulate  below);  Rodriguez-Pinto  v. Tirado-Delgado,  982\n                                                       \nF.2d 34, 41  (1st Cir. 1993) (deeming issue  adverted to in a\n\"perfunctory manner\" on appeal waived).\n\n6.  Plaintiffs cannot  successfully  argue that  the  tolling\nperiod should extend through the time that plaintiff filed an\nunsuccessful motion for reconsideration of the dismissal.  We\nhave  previously rejected  that  same argument  in a  similar\ncontext.  Hilton  Int'l Co.  v. Union de  Trabajadores de  La\n                                                             \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nfile  their  first  lawsuit.   After  the  dismissal of  that\n\nlawsuit, plaintiffs waited in excess of five months to refile\n\ntheir  complaint.   Thus,  even giving  them  the benefit  of\n\ntolling, plaintiffs  waited  more  than  nine  months  before\n\nbringing  suit.7   We therefore  affirm, albeit  on different\n\ngrounds, the district court's decision to dismiss plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                    \n\nIndustria  Gastronomica,  833 F.2d  10,  11  (1st Cir.  1987)\n                       \n(holding  that   plaintiff's   filing   of   a   motion   for\nreconsideration  of  a   dismissal  of  a  previously   filed\ncomplaint  does  not  toll limitations  period  in subsequent\naction). \n\n7.  The question of whether the court's dismissal was with or\nwithout prejudice is therefore irrelevant.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n",

On  August  14,  1990,  plaintiffs\n\ncommenced an  action in federal court  against the government\n\nunder  the Federal  Torts Claims  Act (\"FTCA\"), 28  U.S.C.   \n\n1346(b),  2671,  et  seq.,  alleging  that  the  government's\n                         \n\nnegligent  maintenance of  a  sidewalk at  the Naval  Station\n\ncaused his  injuries.   During the  pendency of  that action,\n\nplaintiffs'  counsel failed  to comply with  an order  of the\n\ndistrict  court  (Pieras,  J.)  directing him  to  attend  an\n\ninitial scheduling conference and to file certain  scheduling\n\nmemoranda.    As a  result,  Judge  Pieras found  plaintiffs'\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\ncounsel  in violation  of  Federal Rules  of Civil  Procedure\n\n16(f)  and 37(b)(2), and, in an order dated January 18, 1991,\n\ndismissed the complaint.   See de Casenave  v. United States,\n                                                            \n\nNo.  90-2095(JP), slip  op. at 5  (D.P.R. January  18, 1991).\n\nThe judgment of  dismissal was entered on  January 23, 1991.1\n\nOn March 4, 1991, Judge Pieras denied plaintiffs'  motion for\n\nreconsideration  of that  dismissal,  and on  April 3,  1991,\n\nplaintiffs filed a notice  of appeal.  Subsequently, however,\n\nplaintiffs moved  for a voluntary dismissal  of their appeal,\n\nwhich this court entered on May 28, 1991.\n\n          On July  10, 1991, plaintiff filed  a new complaint\n\nagainst  the  government  which contained  verbatim  the same\n\nallegations  as  the  first  complaint.    In  response,  the\n\ngovernment filed a  motion to dismiss, arguing  that the six-\n\nmonth statute  of limitations  on plaintiffs' FTCA  claim had\n\nrun.  The  district court (Cerezo,  J.) agreed and  dismissed\n\n                    \n\n1.  In his  January 18 order,  Judge Pieras  stated that  the\ndismissal was  \"with prejudice.\"  The  judgment of dismissal,\nhowever, stated that the dismissal was \"without prejudice.\"\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nthe complaint.2   See de  Casenave v. United  States, 797  F.\n                                                    \n\nSupp. 86, 87 (D.P.R. 1992).  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          A FTCA  claimant has six  months from the  date the\n\nfederal agency  mails the notice  of final denial  of her/his\n\nclaim  to  file  suit in  federal  court.   See  28  U.S.C.  \n                                               \n\n2401(b).3  Here, the  government mailed plaintiffs the notice\n\nof final denial of their claim on March 28, 1990.  Plaintiffs\n\nfiled their new lawsuit  more than one year after  the notice\n\nof  denial was mailed.  Thus, the instant complaint was filed\n\nwell outside  the six-month  limitations period.   Plaintiffs\n\n                    \n\n2.  The  district  court  held  that,  because the  six-month\nstatute of limitations was jurisdictional, it had no power to\napply principles  of equitable tolling  to plaintiffs' claim.\nIn  light of the Supreme Court's holding in Irwin v. Veterans\n                                                             \nAdmin.,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    ,  111 S.

The  record contains  no evidence  that\n\nplaintiffs were induced  or tricked by any misconduct  on the\n\npart of the government to delay as long as they did in filing\n\nthis lawsuit.5   Rather, this case is  a classic example of a\n\nparty  \"[fail]ing  to  exercise due  diligence  in preserving\n\nhis[/her] legal rights.\"  Irwin, 498 U.S.  at    , 111 S. Ct.\n                               \n\nat 458.   Thus, we discern no basis  under which the district\n\ncourt  could  have  applied  equitable principles  to  rescue\n\nplaintiffs' complaint.  Cf. Pipkin, 951 F.2d at 275 (refusing\n                                  \n\nto toll FTCA six-month  limitations period during pendency of\n\npreviously filed lawsuit).  \n\n          Even if the district court  had decided to toll the\n\nsix-month  limitations period  between  the  time  plaintiffs\n\nfiled  the  first  lawsuit  and  the  time  that  action  was\n\ndismissed, plaintiffs' instant complaint would still be time-\n\nbarred.6   Plaintiffs waited four  months and sixteen days to\n\n                    \n\n5.

Plaintiffs cannot  successfully  argue that  the  tolling\nperiod should extend through the time that plaintiff filed an\nunsuccessful motion for reconsideration of the dismissal.  We\nhave  previously rejected  that  same argument  in a  similar\ncontext.  Hilton  Int'l Co.  v.

After  the  dismissal of  that\n\nlawsuit, plaintiffs waited in excess of five months to refile\n\ntheir  complaint.   Thus,  even giving  them  the benefit  of\n\ntolling, plaintiffs  waited  more  than  nine  months  before\n\nbringing  suit.7   We therefore  affirm, albeit  on different\n\ngrounds, the district court's decision to dismiss plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                    \n\nIndustria  Gastronomica,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497014\"><a href=\"/opinion/497014/hilton-international-co-dba-caribe-hilton-hotel-v-union-de/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  11  (1st Cir.  1987)\n                       \n(holding  that   plaintiff's   filing   of   a   motion   for\nreconsideration  of  a   dismissal  of  a  previously   filed\ncomplaint  does  not  toll limitations  period  in subsequent\naction). \n\n7.
