The  issue before  us  is\n                                   \n\nwhether  the  district  court,  in  refusing  to  reconsider  its\n\ndecision to  dismiss a  second amended  complaint for failure  to\n\nstate any non-fraud cause of  action, abused its discretion.  Our\n\nconclusion is that,  even if the issue had  been preserved, there\n\nhas been no abuse.\n\n     The factual essence of the complaint is that plaintiff was a\n\nsupplier  and creditor  of  an  electronics  retailer,  Novedades\n\nGuerra (N.G.); N.G. and  the bank agreed that N.G.  would pay its\n\nsuppliers/creditors with post-dated checks,  which the bank would\n\nhonor; N.G. issued eleven such  checks to plaintiff but the bank,\n\nby  setting off deposits of  N.G.'s sales proceeds against N.G.'s\n\noutstanding debt  to  it, reduced  the  amount available  to  pay\n\nN.G.'s  creditors and discriminated against plaintiff by honoring\n\nsome post-dated checks payable to other creditors; the result was\n\nthat no checks payable to  plaintiff were honored.  The complaint\n\nalso   alleged  that  the  bank  made  false  representations  to\n\ncreditors of N.G., allegations no longer relevant to this appeal.\n\n     The  district  court,  in  dismissing  the   second  amended\n\ncomplaint --  which, it observed,  represented plaintiff's  third\n\nopportunity to  submit an  acceptable pleading  -- referred to  a\n\nlisting of  the supposed non-fraud  causes of action:   breach of\n\ncontract, fraud  and/or negligence,  breach of  fiduciary duties,\n\nmisrepresentation,  unsafe  and  unsound  banking practices,  and\n\ntortious interference with  contractual relationships.   It  held\n\nthat not  only did  plaintiff fail  to set  forth  each claim  as\n\nrequired by Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(b), it also failed to allege facts\n\n(\"as opposed to unverifiable  conclusions\") supporting such claim\n\nor to relate facts to a legal theory.  Therefore, the court held,\n\nplaintiff failed to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n     In moving  to  reconsider this  dismissal, plaintiff  sought\n\nreconsideration  only  \"on  the grounds  that  the  pleadings are\n\nsufficient  to meet the  specificity requirements of  Rule 9(b).\"\n\nThis reference, of course, was to the allegations of fraud.  Only\n\nin the last two pages of the twenty-two page brief supporting the\n\nmotion was  there mention of  non-fraud claims.  Even  here there\n\nwas only the most conclusory assertion that such  claims \"require\n\nonly general pleading\"  -- with no effort to  demonstrate how any\n\nsuch claim could be considered adequate.  At least, the issue was\n\ndiscussed \"in  only a  most  perfunctory manner  . .  . [and  is]\n\ndeemed waived on appeal.\"  Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     To  compound its  difficulties,  while  plaintiff on  appeal\n\nidentifies its claims as including breach of contract, breach  of\n\nfiduciary  duties,  or  tortious  interference  with  contractual\n\nrelations, it proffers arguments only with regard to its claim of\n\n\"negligent  or tortious  conduct.\"   It  cites three  subordinate\n\ntheories.    The  first  is  the bank's  failure  \"to  honor  the\n\nagreement with [N.G.] that the  post-dated checks . . .  would be\n\npaid when  due.\"   This has  the aroma  of an  alleged breach  of\n\ncontract,  but that theory  is not argued  on appeal.   Nor do we\n\n                               -3-\n\nperceive any ground for inferring a duty of care owed by the bank\n\nto creditors of N.G.\n\n     The remaining allegations  are that causes of action in tort\n\narise from the \"intentional or unintentional . . . discriminatory\n\npattern\" of honoring some  post-dated checks but not others,  and\n\nthe bank's setting  off N.G.'s  deposits of  proceeds from  sales\n\nagainst N.G.'s  debt  to  the  bank  rather  than  paying  N.G.'s\n\nsuppliers.  But the arguments were not made in plaintiff's motion\n\nfor reconsideration  below.   We  can hardly  fault the  district\n\ncourt for any abuse of discretion in overlooking claims that were\n\nnever  advanced.    Even  were  we  to  entertain the  arguments,\n\nplaintiff has not  pointed out any legal basis  for deeming these\n\nalleged actions improper or a breach of any duty.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                               -4-\n",
