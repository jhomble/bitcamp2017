Two     sets    of   parents,   whose\n\nreligious beliefs are offended by gay marriage and homosexuality,\n\nsued the Lexington, Massachusetts school district in which their\n\nyoung children are enrolled.          They assert that they must be given\n\nprior notice by the school and the opportunity to exempt their\n\nyoung   children     from   exposure    to    books    they    find    religiously\n\nrepugnant.    Plaintiffs asserted violations of their own and their\n\nchildren's   rights     under   the    Free    Exercise       Clause    and   their\n\nsubstantive parental and privacy due process rights under the U.S.\n\nConstitution.\n\n            The Parkers object to their child being presented in\n\nkindergarten and first grade with two books that portray diverse\n\nfamilies, including families in which both parents are of the same\n\ngender.   The Wirthlins object to a second-grade teacher's reading\n\nto their son's class a book that depicts and celebrates a gay\n\nmarriage.    The parents do not challenge the use of these books as\n\npart of a nondiscrimination curriculum in the public schools, but\n\nchallenge the school district's refusal to provide them with prior\n\nnotice and to allow for exemption from such instruction.                  They ask\n\nfor relief until their children are in seventh grade.\n\n            Massachusetts does have a statute that requires parents\n\nbe given notice and the opportunity to exempt their children from\n\ncurriculum which primarily involves human sexual education or human\n\nsexuality issues.       Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, § 32A.                 The school\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fsystem has declined to apply this statutory exemption to these\n\nplaintiffs on the basis that the materials do not primarily involve\n\nhuman sexual education or human sexuality issues.\n\n           The U.S. District Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint\n\nfor failure to state a federal constitutional claim upon which\n\nrelief could be granted.       Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); Parker v.\n\nHurley, 474 F. Supp. 2d 261, 263 (D. Mass. 2007).                Plaintiffs\n\nappeal.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           Because    plaintiffs   appeal     the    dismissal   of    their\n\ncomplaint under Rule 12(b)(6), we take the allegations in their\n\ncomplaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs'\n\nfavor.    Otero v. Commonwealth of P.R. Indus. Comm'n, 441 F.3d 18,\n\n20 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           In addition to the complaint, we consider the three books\n\nplaintiffs   find    objectionable.1     We   also   take   notice    of   the\n\nstatewide curricular standards of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\n\nand start with those to put this dispute in context.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          Normally, documents not included in the original pleading\ncannot be considered on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion without converting\nthe motion into one for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).\nHowever, \"courts have made narrow exceptions for documents the\nauthenticity of which are not disputed by the parties; for official\nrecords; for documents central to plaintiffs' claim; or for\ndocuments sufficiently referred to in the complaint.\" Watterson v.\nPage, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fA.          Massachusetts Statewide Curricular Standards\n\n            The Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted a comprehensive\n\neducation    reform    bill     in   1993,    requiring   the   State      Board   of\n\nEducation (SBE) to establish academic standards for core subjects.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 69, § 1D.                 The statute mandates that the\n\nstandards \"be designed to inculcate respect for the cultural,\n\nethnic and racial diversity of the commonwealth.\"                   Id.    Further,\n\n\"[a]cademic standards shall be designed to avoid perpetuating\n\ngender, cultural, ethnic or racial stereotypes.\" Id.; see also id.\n\n§    1E   (requiring     same    for   the     establishment        of    curricular\n\nframeworks).      The statute does not specify sexual orientation in\n\nthese lists.\n\n            The    SBE    established        such    standards,      including      a\n\nComprehensive Health Curriculum Framework in 1999.                  That Framework\n\nestablishes Learning Standards, which set different measurable\n\ngoals for students in pre-kindergarten through grade 5, grades 6-8,\n\nand grades 9-12. The Health Framework also specifically notes that\n\n\"public schools must notify parents before implementing curriculum\n\nthat involves human sexuality.\"\n\n            Within     the    Framework      are   Strands,   and    Strands   have\n\ndifferent components.           Under the Social and Emotional Health\n\nStrand, there is a Family Life component, which states:\n\n            Students   will  gain   knowledge  about  the\n            significance of the family on individuals and\n            society, and will learn skills to support the\n            family, balance work and family life, be an\n\n                                        -5-\n\f             effective parent, and nurture the development of\n             children.\n\nThe Learning Standard for elementary school grades under the Family\n\nLife component states that children should be able to \"[d]escribe\n\ndifferent types of families.\"\n\n             In addition, the Social and Emotional Health Strand\n\nincludes an Interpersonal Relationships component.          That component\n\nprovides:\n\n             Students will learn that relationships with\n             others are an integral part of the human life\n             experience and the factors that contribute to\n             healthy interpersonal relationships, and will\n             acquire skills to enhance and make many of these\n             relationships more fulfilling through commitment\n             and communication.\n\nThe associated Learning Standard for pre-kindergarten through grade\n\n5 recommends that children be able to \"[d]escribe the concepts of\n\nprejudice and discrimination.\"\n\n             It is not until grades 6-8 that the Learning Standards\n\nunder this component address \"the detrimental effect of prejudice\n\n(such   as    prejudice   on   the    basis   of   race,   gender,   sexual\n\norientation, class, or religion) on individual relationships and\n\nsociety as a whole.\"\n\n             There is also a Reproduction/Sexuality component under\n\nthe Physical Health Strand.          Within that component, the Learning\n\nStandards provide that by grade 5, students should be able to\n\n\"[d]efine sexual orientation using the correct terminology (such as\n\nheterosexual, and gay and lesbian).\"\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            These statewide academic standards do not purport to\n\nselect particular instructional materials, but only to be a guide\n\nto assist others in that selection.                Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 69, § 1E.\n\nThus, there is no statewide regulation or policy providing for the\n\nuse of the particular texts in dispute here.\n\n            By    statute,     the    actual       selection     of    books     is   the\n\nresponsibility of a school's principal, with the approval of the\n\nsuperintendent of schools.             Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, § 48.                   We\n\nassume these books were chosen locally subject to the terms of that\n\nstatute.       Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that Lexington\n\nschool officials began integrating books like these into their\n\nelementary      school's     curriculum       at   the    behest      of   gay   rights\n\nadvocates.      Compl. ¶¶ 32-33.\n\n            In 1996, the Massachusetts legislature adopted a parental\n\nnotification statute to be implemented by schools starting with the\n\n1997-1998 school year.         Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, § 32A.              Section 32A\n\nrequires school districts to provide parents with notice of and an\n\nopportunity      to   exempt    their    children        from    \"curriculum      which\n\nprimarily      involves     human    sexual    education        or   human   sexuality\n\nissues.\"     The Commissioner of Education, in an advisory opinion\n\nguiding the implementation of the new law, noted that it was\n\nintended to apply to discrete curricular units, such as \"any\n\ncourses (typically, sex education or portions of a health education\n\nor   science     course),    school     assemblies       or   other    instructional\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\factivities       and    programs.\"2     Schools   must   make    the   relevant\n\ncurricular materials available for parents to review, though they\n\ndo not necessarily have to allow parents to observe the classes.\n\nThe statute mandates that the Department of Education promulgate\n\nregulations for resolving any disputes arising under section 32A,\n\nwhich the Department has done.           See 603 Mass. Code Regs. 5.01 et\n\nseq.       Lexington has a section 32A policy in place.\n\n               On November 18, 2003, a divided Supreme Judicial Court of\n\nMassachusetts held, in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health,\n\n798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003), that the state constitution mandates\n\nthe recognition of same-sex marriage.             A later effort to reverse\n\nthis decision through the mechanism of a constitutional convention\n\nand a popular vote failed.\n\nB.             The Parkers\n\n               David and Tonia Parker's sons, Jacob and Joshua Parker,\n\nand Joseph and Robin Wirthlin's son, Joseph Robert Wirthlin, Jr.,\n\nare    students        at   Estabrook   Elementary   School     in   Lexington,\n\nMassachusetts.         Both families assert that they are devout Judeo-\n\nChristians and that a core belief of their religion is that\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          That statute has been interpreted in an opinion letter by\nthe Department of Education not to apply to educational materials\ndesigned to promote tolerance, including materials recognizing\ndifferences in sexual orientation, if those materials are presented\n\"without further instruction or discussion of the physical and\nsexual implications of homosexuality.\"\n\n                                        -8-\n\fhomosexual behavior and gay marriage are immoral and violate God's\n\nlaw.\n\n            In January 2005, when Jacob Parker (\"Jacob\") was in\n\nkindergarten,      he   brought      home    a     \"Diversity    Book   Bag.\"       This\n\nincluded    a    picture     book,   Who's        in   a   Family?,   which   depicted\n\ndifferent families, including single-parent families, an extended\n\nfamily, interracial families, animal families, a family without\n\nchildren, and -- to the concern of the Parkers -- a family with two\n\ndads and a family with two moms.                 The book concludes by answering\n\nthe question, \"Who's in a family?\": \"The people who love you the\n\nmost!\"    The book says nothing about marriage.\n\n            The Parkers were concerned that this book was part of an\n\neffort by the public schools \"to indoctrinate young children into\n\nthe concept that homosexuality and homosexual relationships or\n\nmarriage are moral and acceptable behavior.\"                   Compl. ¶ 30.     Such an\n\neffort, they feared, would require their sons to affirm a belief\n\ninconsistent with their religion.                 Id. ¶ 33.    On January 21, 2005,\n\nthey met with Estabrook's principal, Joni Jay (\"Jay\"), to request\n\nthat     Jacob   not    be    exposed       to     any     further    discussions    of\n\nhomosexuality.         Principal Jay disagreed that the school had any\n\nobligation under section 32A to notify parents in advance of such\n\nclass discussions.           In March 2005, the Parkers repeated their\n\nrequest that \"no teacher or adult expose [Jacob] to any materials\n\nor discussions featuring sexual orientation, same-sex unions, or\n\n                                            -9-\n\fhomosexuality without notification to the Parkers and the right to\n\n'opt out,'\" this time including in their communication the then-\n\nSuperintendent of Lexington's schools, William Hurley (\"Hurley\"),\n\nand two other district-wide administrators.        Id. ¶ 34.   This\n\nrequest was met with the same response.      A further meeting to\n\ndiscuss these issues was held at Estabrook on April 27, 2005, which\n\nresulted in Mr. Parker's arrest when he refused to leave the school\n\nuntil his demands were met.\n\n          As the 2005-2006 school year began, Paul Ash (\"Ash\"), the\n\ncurrent Superintendent, released a public statement explaining the\n\nschool district's position that it would not provide parental\n\nnotification for \"discussions, activities, or materials that simply\n\nreference same-gender parents or that otherwise recognize the\n\nexistence of differences in sexual orientation.\"        When Jacob\n\nentered first grade that fall, his classroom's book collection\n\nincluded Who's in a Family? as well as Molly's Family, a picture\n\nbook about a girl who is at first made to feel embarrassed by a\n\nclassmate because she has both a mommy and a mama but then learns\n\nthat families can come in many different varieties.     In December\n\n2005, the Parkers repeated their request for advance notice, which\n\nSuperintendent Ash again denied.\n\nC.        The Wirthlins\n\n          We turn to the other plaintiff family.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f          In March 2006, an Estabrook teacher read aloud King and\n\nKing to her second grade class, which included Joseph Robert\n\nWirthlin, Jr. (\"Joey\").    This picture book tells the story of a\n\nprince, ordered by his mother to get married, who first rejects\n\nseveral princesses only to fall in love with another prince.      A\n\nwedding scene between the two princes is depicted.    The last page\n\nof the book shows the two princes kissing, but with a red heart\n\nsuperimposed over their mouths.      There is no allegation in the\n\ncomplaint that the teacher further discussed the book with the\n\nclass.   That evening, Joey told his parents about the book; his\n\nparents described him as \"agitated\" and remembered him calling the\n\nbook \"so silly.\"   Id. ¶ 57.   Eventually the Wirthlins were able to\n\nsecure a meeting with the teacher and Jay on April 6, 2006, to\n\nobject to what they considered to be indoctrination of their son\n\nabout gay marriage in contravention of their religious beliefs.\n\nJay reiterated the school district's position that no prior notice\n\nor exemption would be given.\n\nD.        Procedural History\n\n          On April 27, 2006, the Parkers and the Wirthlins filed\n\nsuit on behalf of themselves and their children in federal district\n\ncourt against Hurley, Ash, Jay, and Joey Wirthlin's teacher, as\n\nwell as the town of Lexington, the members of its school board, and\n\nother school district administrators.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            The   complaint   alleges    that   the   public   schools   are\n\nsystematically indoctrinating the Parkers' and the Wirthlins' young\n\nchildren contrary to the parents' religious beliefs and that the\n\ndefendants held \"a specific intention to denigrate the [families']\n\nsincere and deeply-held faith.\"         Id. ¶ 66.     They claim, under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, violations of their and their children's First\n\nAmendment right to the free exercise of religion and of their\n\nFourteenth Amendment due process right to parental autonomy in the\n\nupbringing of their children, as well as of their concomitant state\n\nrights.3    They also assert a violation of the Massachusetts \"opt\n\nout\" statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, § 32A.\n\n            The plaintiffs argue that their ability to influence\n\ntheir young children toward their family religious views has been\n\nundercut in several respects.      First, they believe their children\n\nare too young to be introduced to the topic of gay marriage.             They\n\nalso point to the important influence teachers have on this age\n\ngroup.     They fear their own inability as parents to counter the\n\nschool's approval of gay marriage, particularly if parents are\n\n\n\n     3\n          The plaintiffs also claim that defendants violated § 1983\nby conspiring to deprive them of these constitutional rights. They\ndo not assert an Establishment Clause claim.\n          We note that the Supreme Judicial Court has held that the\nMassachusetts state constitution provides greater protection for\nfree exercise claims then does the federal constitution. Attorney\nGen. v. Desilets, 636 N.E.2d 233, 235-36 (Mass. 1994). Plaintiffs\nbrought their suit in federal court and have chosen not to request\ncertification of any state law issues to the Supreme Judicial\nCourt.\n\n                                  -12-\n\f  given no notice that such curricular materials are in use.           As\n\nfor the children, the parents fear that they are \"essentially\"\n\nrequired \"to affirm a belief inconsistent with and prohibited by\n\ntheir religion.\"       Compl. ¶ 33.     The parents assert it is ironic,\n\nand unconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause, for a public\n\nschool system to show such intolerance towards their own religious\n\nbeliefs in the name of tolerance.\n\n              For relief, the plaintiffs seek a declaration of their\n\nconstitutional rights; damages; and an injunction requiring the\n\nschool (1) to provide an opportunity to exempt their children from\n\n\"classroom presentations or discussions the intent of which is to\n\nhave children accept the validity of, embrace, affirm, or celebrate\n\nviews    of    human    sexuality,     gender   identity,   and   marriage\n\nconstructs,\" (2) to allow the parents to observe any such classroom\n\ndiscussions, and (3) to not present any \"materials graphically\n\ndepicting homosexual physical contact\" to students before the\n\nseventh grade.4\n\n              The defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a\n\nclaim upon which relief could           be granted.    Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6). After hearing oral arguments, the district court granted\n\n\n     4\n          In the request for injunctive relief, plaintiffs also\nsought an opt-out right regarding \"classroom presentations or\ndiscussions when the intent is to have children accept the validity\nof, embrace, affirm or celebrate belief systems or religious\nperspectives.\" Because the complaint does not allege any instance\nof such a classroom presentation or discussion, we do not further\nconsider this particular claim for relief.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fthe defendants' motion on February 23, 2007.                 The court dismissed\n\nthe state claims without prejudice so that they could be reasserted\n\nin state court.        Parker, 474 F. Supp. 2d at 263.\n\n             As to the federal claims, the district court found this\n\ncase indistinguishable from Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Productions,\n\n68 F.3d 525 (1st Cir. 1995).          In Brown, this circuit held that the\n\nFree Exercise Clause and the parents' substantive due process\n\nrights were not violated by one instance of a school system's\n\nfailure to provide prior notice and an exemption for a specific\n\nhigh school assembly on human sexuality.                Holding that Brown was\n\nanalytically identical to the present case, the district court\n\napplied rational basis review and concluded that the state's\n\ninterest in preventing discrimination, specifically discrimination\n\ntargeted     at    students   in    school,      justified   the   policy   of   the\n\nLexington schools.

Otero,   441     F.3d   at     20.   Plaintiffs'     \"[f]actual\n\nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the\n\nspeculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in\n\nthe complaint are true.\"           Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct.\n\n1955, 1965 (2007) (citations omitted).                 We affirm the order of\n\ndismissal, albeit on grounds different from the district court's\n\nreasoning.        See Otero, 441 F.3d at 20.\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f           There are several ways to approach the parents' claim\n\ndepending upon how this case is categorized.            One could start by\n\nasking how strong the school's interest must be to justify the\n\ndenial of the parents' request for an exemption (as opposed to\n\nasking about the nature of the plaintiffs' interests, as we do\n\nbelow).   The parties have focused on the standard of justification\n\nthe defendants must meet in the aftermath of Employment Division v.\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990).      What is clear from Smith is that not\n\nall free exercise challenges will survive motions to dismiss and\n\nnot all will receive strict scrutiny review.\n\n           One possible answer is that, under Smith, the school may\n\nhave to show no more than that its choice of books and its refusal\n\nto provide exemption is rational. In Smith, the Court rejected the\n\nplaintiffs' claim that they had unconstitutionally been denied\n\nunemployment benefits due to their violation of Oregon's general\n\ncriminal prohibition on the use of peyote, even though they had\n\nused the peyote for religious purposes.        The Court found no free\n\nexercise objection to the criminal statute's enforcement because,\n\nas it summarized in a later case, \"a law that is neutral and of\n\ngeneral   applicability   need   not   be   justified    by   a   compelling\n\ngovernmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of\n\nburdening a particular religious practice.\"        Church of the Lukumi\n\nBabalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f           If Smith's mere rationality test were the applicable\n\nstandard, this case would easily be dismissed.          Plaintiffs do not\n\ncontest   that   the   defendants    have   an   interest    in   promoting\n\ntolerance,   including   for   the    children   (and   parents)     of   gay\n\nmarriages.   The Supreme Court has often referred to the role of\n\npublic education in the preparation of students for citizenship.\n\nSee, e.g., Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 681-\n\n85 (1986) (upholding ability of schools to prohibit lewd speech).\n\nGiven that Massachusetts has recognized gay marriage under its\n\nstate constitution, it is entirely rational for its schools to\n\neducate their students regarding that recognition.5\n\n           In plaintiffs' favor, however, we will assume their case\n\nis not necessarily subject to this general Smith rule.            First, the\n\ncase does not arise in the same context as Smith.           Plaintiffs have\n\nnot engaged in conduct prohibited by state law or otherwise sought\n\nto avoid compliance with a law of general applicability.6           Nor does\n\n\n     5\n          We do not reach the question of whether there is a\ncompelling interest, either state or federal, in teaching tolerance\nfor gay marriage to elementary school students in the public school\nsystem. Cf. Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 604\n(1983) (holding that federal government's compelling interest in\neradicating racial discrimination outweighed plaintiffs' free\nexercise claim); Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 499-\n500 (1977) (holding that city lacked compelling justification for\nimpinging on due process right of familial privacy).\n     6\n          In City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), the\nSupreme Court appeared to assume that Smith would apply to non-\ncriminal regulations such as zoning ordinances. Id. at 535. At\nleast four circuits have held that Smith is not limited to criminal\nprohibitions. Fairbanks v. Brackettville Bd. of Educ., No. 99-\n\n                                    -16-\n\fstate law or a formal policy require that the defendants take the\n\nactions they did.   Indeed, there is not even a formal, district-\n\nwide policy of affirming gay marriage through the use of such\n\neducational materials with young students.\n\n          In contrast to the mere rationality standard for neutral\n\nlaws of general applicability, Smith and its progeny require a\n\ncompelling justification for any law that targets religious groups.\n\nSee Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546 (invalidating law targeting religious\n\ngroup). This case also does not fit into the \"targeting\" category,\n\nas the Supreme Court has used the phrase.      The school was not\n\nsingling out plaintiffs' particular religious beliefs or targeting\n\nits tolerance lessons to only those children from families with\n\nreligious objections to gay marriage.    Cf. id. at 542.   The fact\n\nthat a school promotes tolerance of different sexual orientations\n\nand gay marriage when such tolerance is anathema to some religious\n\ngroups does not constitute targeting.\n\n          The Smith Court, in our view, left open other possible\n\napproaches.   The Court in Smith did not say it overruled any prior\n\nfree exercise cases.   For example, it reinterpreted the balancing\n\n\n\n\n50265, 2000 WL 821401, at *2 (5th Cir. May 30, 2000); Miller v.\nReed, 176 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 1999); Vandiver v. Hardin\nCounty Bd. of Educ., 925 F.2d 927, 932 (6th Cir. 1991); Salvation\nArmy v. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs, 919 F.2d 183, 194-96 (3d Cir.\n1990); see also Gary S. v. Manchester Sch. Dist., 374 F.3d 15, 18-\n19 (1st Cir. 2004) (refusing to limit the Smith rule to statutes\nrelated to socially harmful conduct).\n\n                               -17-\n\ftest of Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963),7 under which the\n\ncourt \"asks whether the government has placed a substantial burden\n\non the observation of a central religious belief or practice and,\n\nif so, whether a compelling governmental interest justifies the\n\nburden,\" Hernandez v. Comm'r, 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989).               Smith\n\nclarified that the Sherbert test does not apply to violations of a\n\ngeneral prohibition.          Smith, 494 U.S. at 883-85.         The Court\n\nexpressed unwillingness to apply the Sherbert test outside the\n\nunemployment compensation cases in which it had found free exercise\n\nviolations, id. at 883, explaining that the Sherbert approach was\n\n\"developed   in   a   context    that   lent   itself   to   individualized\n\ngovernmental      assessment\"     of    each   plaintiff's      \"particular\n\ncircumstances,\" id. at 884.       Thus it summarized the Sherbert line\n\nof cases as \"stand[ing] for the proposition that where the State\n\nhas in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse\n\nto extend that system to cases of 'religious hardship' without\n\ncompelling reason.\"     Id.    Plaintiffs have not argued that they fit\n\nwithin this redefinition of Sherbert, so we do not address the\n\ntheory.8\n\n\n     7\n          But cf. Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao\ndo Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 424 (2006) (describing Smith as\n\"reject[ing] the interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause\nannounced in Sherbert\").\n     8\n          Plaintiffs have not argued, for example, that the\nCommonwealth, having provided an exemption for sex education under\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, § 32A, is compelled by either the state or\nfederal constitution to extend the exemption to this situation.\n\n                                    -18-\n\f          Smith, by its terms, also carved out an area of \"hybrid\n\nsituations.\"   Id. at 881-82.   Plaintiffs argue this is where their\n\nclaim fits.    Smith described such hybrid situations as involving\n\nfree exercise claims brought in conjunction with other claims of\n\nviolations of constitutional protections.          Smith gave as one\n\nexample of a companion claim \"the right of parents . . . to direct\n\nthe education of their children,\" citing to Pierce v. Society of\n\nSisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205\n\n(1972).   Smith, 494 U.S. at 881.       In this hybrid category, Smith\n\n\n           Indeed, there are factual distinctions between the two\nsituations. Sex education as referred to in section 32A is usually\nset out as an independent course segment at prearranged times and\nplaces. Notice and exemption is thus far easier to accomplish. By\ncontrast, the notice and exemption requested here would require\nbroad advance notice of \"any adult-directed or initiated classroom\ndiscussions    of  sexuality,   gender   identity,   and   marriage\nconstructs,\" discussions that could arise often in almost any part\nof the curriculum.\n           Plaintiffs do point out, however, that because this case\nwas decided on a motion to dismiss, the defendants have put on no\nevidence that the school system would bear any burden if required\nto give them this notice and exemption. Defendants have not, for\ninstance, argued that granting the plaintiffs an exemption from\nsuch classroom instruction would violate the Establishment Clause.\nSee Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n, 480 U.S. 136, 144-45\n(1987) (\"[G]overnment may (and sometimes must) accommodate\nreligious practices . . . without violating the Establishment\nClause.\").\n           Amici, however, argue that such exemptions would\nsignificantly burden the schools because (1) there would be an\nexodus from classrooms if plaintiffs received the relief requested\nand that (2) this in turn would send a message that children of\nsame-sex parents are inferior. This is mere supposition and may\nnot be credited on a motion to dismiss, where inferences must be\ndrawn in the plaintiffs' favor. Plaintiffs argue for their part\nthat the remedy they seek would teach other students tolerance of\ndifferent religious beliefs.\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\falso included cases of compelled expression decided on free speech\n\ngrounds, but which also involved freedom of religion, such as West\n\nVirginia Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943).\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 882.         The Smith Court commented that only in\n\nthese hybrid situations had the Court ever held that \"the First\n\nAmendment bar[red] application of a neutral, generally applicable\n\nlaw to religiously motivated action.\"           Id. at 881.\n\n          What   the    Court    meant    by   its   discussion   of   \"hybrid\n\nsituations\" in Smith has led to a great deal of discussion and\n\ndisagreement.    See,    e.g.,    E.     Chemerinsky,   Constitutional    Law\n\n§ 12.3.2.3, at 1262 (3d ed. 2006) (noting different treatments of\n\nthe hybrid rights language by the lower courts).           Observers debate\n\nwhether Smith created a new hybrid rights doctrine, or whether in\n\ndiscussing \"hybrid situations\" the Court was merely noting in\n\ndescriptive terms that it was not overruling certain cases such as\n\nPierce and Yoder.   Compare M.E. Lechliter, Note, The Free Exercise\n\nof Religion and Public Schools: The Implication of Hybrid Rights on\n\nthe Religious Upbringing of Children, 103 Mich. L. Rev. 2209, 2220-\n\n21 (2005), with M.W. McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism and the\n\nSmith Decision, 57 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1109, 1121-22 (1990).                Courts\n\nand commentators also disagree over how strong the companion\n\nconstitutional claim must be to establish a hybrid situation:\n\nwhether, for example, the associated claim must be independently\n\nviable, or whether it is enough for the claim to be \"colorable.\"\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fSee, e.g., Miller v. Reed, 176 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 1999)\n\n(requiring a colorable claim that another constitutional right has\n\nbeen violated); Swanson ex rel. Swanson v. Guthrie Indep. Sch.\n\nDist.        No.    I-L,     135    F.3d   694,    700   (10th   Cir.    1998)   (same);\n\nLechliter,           supra,        at   2226-33     (identifying        and   describing\n\ndisagreement among courts).9                 Yet another debate is whether such\n\n\"hybrid\" cases automatically subject the governmental defendant to\n\nthe compelling state interest test.10                    Plaintiffs argue that they\n\nhave pled a hybrid claim and that this entitles them to strict\n\nscrutiny           review,    which     requires    defendants     to    demonstrate   a\n\ncompelling state interest.\n\n                   No published circuit court opinion, including Brown, has\n\never applied strict scrutiny to a case in which plaintiffs argued\n\nthey had presented a hybrid claim.                  See, e.g., Civil Liberties for\n\nUrban Believers v. City of Chicago, 342 F.3d 752, 764-65 (7th Cir.\n\n\n        9\n          Others have interpreted this circuit's decision in Brown\nas falling into the former category -- that is, requiring an\nindependently viable constitutional claim. See, e.g., Lechliter,\nsupra, at 2226-27; R.C. Miller, Annotation, What Constitutes\n\"Hybrid Rights\" Claim, 163 A.L.R. Fed. 493 § 6.      Brown did not\nexplicitly consider this debate, and the parental rights claim\nasserted in that case was found to be so weak that it was not a\ncolorable claim, much less an independently viable one. Thus we do\nnot read Brown as having settled this question or as firmly\nestablishing that Smith created a new category of hybrid claims.\n        10\n          There is no occasion here to consider whether there might\nbe an intermediate step in which the degree of justification may\nvary with the type of burden asserted. See, e.g., Fraternal Order\nof Police Newark Lodge No. 12 v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359, 366\n& n.7 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying intermediate scrutiny because the\nplaintiffs' claim arose in the public employment context).\n\n                                             -21-\n\f2003); Henderson v. Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2001);\n\nMiller, 176 F.3d at 1208; Swanson, 135 F.3d at 700; Salvation Army\n\nv. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs, 919 F.2d 183, 199-200 & n.9 (3d Cir.\n\n1990).11   As for this circuit, Brown noted that Yoder survived\n\nSmith, but then explained that the facts in Brown were far from\n\nanalogous to the unique facts of Yoder, and held that no hybrid\n\nclaim was presented.12   Brown, 68 F.3d at 539.   Other circuits have\n\nheld explicitly that Smith does not create a new category of hybrid\n\nclaims.    See, e.g., Leebaert v. Harrington, 332 F.3d 134, 143-44\n\n(2d Cir. 2003); Kissinger v. Bd. of Trs., 5 F.3d 177, 180 (6th Cir.\n\n1993); see also Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 567 (Souter, J., concurring)\n\n(describing the hybrid distinction drawn by Smith as \"ultimately\n\nuntenable\").\n\n\n\n\n     11\n          A Ninth Circuit panel did apply strict scrutiny, but that\nopinion was later withdrawn by the court en banc.        Thomas v.\nAnchorage Equal Rights Comm'n, 165 F.3d 692, 714-17 (9th Cir.\n1999), vacated by 220 F.3d 1134 (9th Cir. 2000). The D.C. Circuit\nopinion in EEOC v. Catholic University of America, 83 F.3d 455\n(D.C. Cir. 1996), might be read as implying that strict scrutiny\nwould apply in hybrid situations, but its brief discussion of\nhybrid rights was merely an alternate ground for its holding. See\nid. at 467.\n     12\n          Also, in Gary S. v. Manchester School District, 374 F.3d\n15 (1st Cir. 2004), this court held that no hybrid claim was\npresented by a disabled private school student's parents, who\nargued that their son was entitled to all the same services under\nIDEA as public school students. Id. at 19 (endorsing Gary S. v.\nManchester Sch. Dist., 241 F. Supp. 2d 111, 121 (D.N.H. 2003)).\nThe failure to provide those IDEA benefits to private school\nstudents does not impose any cognizable burden upon the religion of\nthose who choose private schools. Id. at 20.\n\n                                -22-\n\f          Without     entering   the    fray   over   the   meaning    and\n\napplication of Smith's \"hybrid situations\" language, we approach\n\nthe parents' claims as the Court did in Yoder.        In that case, the\n\nCourt did not analyze separately the due process and free exercise\n\ninterests of the parent-plaintiffs, but rather considered the two\n\nclaims interdependently, given that those two sets of interests\n\ninform one other.13   See Yoder, 406 U.S. at 213-14, 232-34.          We do\n\nnot need to resolve the hybrid rights debate because the level of\n\njustification the government must demonstrate -- a rational basis,\n\na compelling interest, or something in between -- is irrelevant in\n\nthis case.   While we accept as true plaintiffs' assertion that\n\ntheir sincerely held religious beliefs were deeply offended, we\n\nfind that they have not described a constitutional burden on their\n\nrights, or on those of their children.\n\n\n\n     13\n          While some have criticized the hybrid rights concept,\nsaying it tries to make something out of nothing, see Henderson,\n253 F.3d at 19 (\"[I]n law as in mathematics zero plus zero equals\nzero.\"), others have noted that \"it is equally true that the sum of\na number of fractions -- one-half plus one-half, for example -- may\nequal one,\" R.F. Duncan, Free Exercise Is Dead, Long Live Free\nExercise:     Smith, Lukumi, and the General Applicability\nRequirement, 3 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 850, 858 (2001).\n          In the criminal law, we have recognized that at times the\ncumulative effect of a series of individual rulings, none of which\nindividually constituted error, could mean the trial was not fair,\nUnited States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st Cir. 1993),\nthough we do not conclude that this is an appropriate analogy.\n          As in Brown, we do not settle the question of what must\nbe pled to raise a viable hybrid claim, as Smith uses the term.\nOur point here is rather that parental rights and the free exercise\nof religion by parents are interests that overlap and inform each\nother, and thus are sensibly considered together.\n\n                                 -23-\n\f            Even    if    Smith     largely      set     aside   in   free      exercise\n\njurisprudence, at least in some contexts, \"the balancing question\n\n-- whether the state's interest outweighs the plaintiff's interest\n\nin being free from interference,\" it did not alter the standard\n\nconstitutional threshold question.                N.M. Stolzenberg, \"He Drew a\n\nCircle That Shut Me Out\": Assimilation, Indoctrination, and the\n\nParadox of a Liberal Education, 106 Harv. L. Rev. 581, 592-93\n\n(1993). That question is \"whether the plaintiff's free exercise is\n\ninterfered with at all.\"           Id.; see also Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery\n\nProtective Ass'n, 485 U.S. 439, 451-52 (1988) (denying a free\n\nexercise    claim        despite     potential         \"devastating        effects   on\n\ntraditional Indian religious practices\" because \"the Constitution\n\nsimply does not provide a principle that could justify upholding\n\nrespondents' legal claims\"); Bauchman ex rel. Bauchman v. W. High\n\nSch., 132 F.3d 542, 557 (10th Cir. 1997) (requiring plaintiff\n\nasserting a free exercise claim to demonstrate burden, either\n\nthrough coercion or compulsion). In this case there is no pleading\n\nof a constitutionally significant burden on plaintiffs' rights.\n\n            In Yoder, the Court found unconstitutional Wisconsin's\n\napplication of its compulsory school attendance law to Amish\n\nparents    who   believed     that       any    education    beyond    eighth     grade\n\nundermined their entire, religiously focused way of life. 406 U.S.\n\nat   235-36.       The    heart     of    the    Yoder    opinion     is    a   lengthy\n\nconsideration of \"the interrelationship of belief with [the Amish]\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\fmode of life, the vital role that belief and daily conduct play in\n\nthe continued survival of Old Order Amish communities and their\n\nreligious organization,\" and how as a result compulsory high school\n\neducation    would    \"substantially     interfer[e]      with    the   religious\n\ndevelopment of the Amish child and his integration into the way of\n\nlife of the Amish faith community.\"           Id. at 218, 235.          The Court\n\nthus found Wisconsin's compulsory attendance law to be flatly\n\nincompatible with the plaintiffs' free exercise rights and parental\n\nliberty   interests,     which    it   considered    in   tandem.       That   is,\n\ncompulsory attendance at any school -- whether public, private, or\n\nhome-based -- prevented these Amish parents from making fundamental\n\ndecisions    regarding    their    children's      religious     upbringing    and\n\neffectively overrode their ability to pass their religion on to\n\ntheir children, as their faith required.            Id. at 233-35.       Further,\n\nthe   parents    in   Yoder   were     able   to    demonstrate     that    their\n\nalternative informal vocational training of their older children\n\nstill met the state's professed interest behind its compulsory\n\nattendance requirement.       Id. at 235.\n\n             To the extent that Yoder embodies judicial protection for\n\nsocial and religious \"sub-groups from the public cultivation of\n\nliberal tolerance,\" plaintiffs are correct to rely on it.                      See\n\nStolzenberg, supra, at 637.        But there are substantial differences\n\nbetween the plaintiffs' claims in Yoder and the claims raised in\n\nthis case.      One ground of distinction is that the plaintiffs have\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fchosen to place their children in public schools and do not live,\n\nas the Amish do, in a largely separate culture.               There are others.\n\nWhile plaintiffs do invoke Yoder's language that the state is\n\nthreatening their very \"way of life,\" they use this language to\n\nrefer to the centrality of these beliefs to their faith, in\n\ncontrast to its use in Yoder to refer to a distinct community and\n\nlife style.       Exposure to the materials in dispute here will not\n\nautomatically and irreversibly prevent the parents from raising\n\nJacob and Joey in the religious belief that gay marriage is\n\nimmoral.     Nor is there a criminal statute involved, or any other\n\npunishment imposed on the parents if they choose to educate their\n\nchildren in other ways. They retain options, unlike the parents in\n\nYoder.       Tellingly,       Yoder   emphasized     that     its    holding       was\n\nessentially sui generis, as few sects could make a similar showing\n\nof   a   unique    and   demanding     religious      way    of     life   that    is\n\nfundamentally incompatible with any schooling system.                  See Yoder,\n\n406 U.S. at 235-36.       Plaintiffs' case is not Yoder.\n\n            Despite defendants' contention, plaintiffs' case is also\n\nnot Brown.    Brown concerned a federal constitutional challenge to\n\na one-time failure by a Massachusetts high school to comply with\n\nthe notice and exemption procedures required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n71, § 32A, for a student's attendance at a discrete sex education\n\nassembly.      Brown     is    factually    and    legally    distinct.           Most\n\nsignificantly,      Brown     involved     the    education    of     high   school\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fstudents, not the education of kindergarten through second-grade\n\nstudents.    Educators treat this age differential as significant.\n\nThe statewide curricular standards themselves, including those\n\nrelated to sexual orientation, distinguish between elementary and\n\nhigh school students.    Further, as the plaintiffs sensibly point\n\nout, high school students are less responsive to what adults say\n\nthan are very young elementary school children.\n\n            The impressionability of young school children has been\n\nnoted as a relevant factor in the Establishment Clause context.\n\nSee, e.g., Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 592 (1992) (identifying\n\nconcerns about the \"subtle coercive pressure [of state endorsement\n\nof religion] in the elementary and secondary public schools\"); Sch.\n\nDist. of Abington Twp. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 307 (1963)\n\n(Goldberg, J., concurring) (expressing concern about the impact of\n\nschool   prayer   and   Bible   reading   on   \"young   impressionable\n\nchildren\"); L.H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law, § 14-5, at\n\n1177-79 (2d ed. 1988).      Just as university students \"are less\n\nimpressionable than younger students\" when it comes to school\n\npolicies regarding religion, Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 274\n\nn.14 (1981), so also are high school students less impressionable\n\nthan the very youngest children, see Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.\n\n602, 616 (1971) (noting that \"inculcating religious doctrine is .\n\n. . enhanced by the impressionable age of the pupils, in primary\n\n\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fschools particularly\"); see also Fleischfresser v. Dirs. of Sch.\n\nDist. 200, 15 F.3d 680, 686 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\n            The relevance of the age of school children has been\n\nnoted in a free speech case involving religious expression.         Curry\n\nex rel. Curry v. Hensiner, ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 141076, at *6 (6th\n\nCir. Jan. 16, 2008).         The age of the student has also been\n\nidentified as relevant in the context of parental due process\n\nrights.    See C.N. v. Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 430 F.3d 159, 185 (3d\n\nCir. 2005) (recognizing that \"introducing a child to sensitive\n\ntopics before a parent might have done so herself can complicate\n\nand even undermine parental authority\").\n\n            We see no principled reason why the age of students\n\nshould be irrelevant in Free Exercise Clause cases.         See, e.g., M.\n\nEichner,     Who   Should   Control    Children's   Education?:   Parents,\n\nChildren, and the State, 75 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1339, 1382, 1386 (2007)\n\n(age of children should be taken into account when considering\n\nparental due process or free exercise claims in the public school\n\ncontext).    Based on this distinction alone, Brown does not control\n\nthis case.\n\n            We turn afresh to plaintiffs' complementary due process\n\nand free exercise claims.        Plaintiffs' opening premise is that\n\ntheir rights of parental control are fundamental rights.14            They\n\n\n     14\n         In Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997), the\nCourt listed fundamental rights protected by the Due Process\nClause. Id. at 719-20. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that\n\n                                      -28-\n\frely on a Supreme Court decision recognizing a substantive due\n\nprocess right of parents \"to make decisions concerning the care,\n\ncustody, and control of their children.\"   Troxel v. Granville, 530\n\nU.S. 57, 66 (2000) (plurality opinion).    Troxel is not so broad as\n\nplaintiffs assert.      The cases cited by the Court in Troxel as\n\nestablishing this parental right pertain either to the custody of\n\nchildren, which was also the issue in dispute in Troxel, or to the\n\nfundamental control of children's schooling, as in Yoder.   See id.\n\nat 65-66.15   The Troxel plurality did not, however, specifically\n\naddress which standard of review to apply when this due process\n\nright is implicated.\n\n          The schooling cases cited in Troxel \"evince the principle\n\nthat the state cannot prevent parents from choosing a specific\n\neducational program.\"    Brown, 68 F.3d at 533 (emphasis added).   In\n\nMeyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923), the Supreme Court found\n\nunconstitutional a prohibition on the teaching of foreign languages\n\n\n\nno state may \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. That\ndue process right has both a procedural and a substantive\ncomponent: it ensures fair process, and it \"provides heightened\nprotection against government interference with certain fundamental\nrights and liberty interests.\" Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720.\n     15\n          In slight variations on these themes, the Court also\ncited Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979), which pertained to the\npower of parents to commit their children to mental institutions,\nand Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), in which the\nCourt determined that the parent's liberty interest was outweighed\nin that instance by the state's interest in enforcing child labor\nand compulsory attendance laws.\n\n                                -29-\n\fto young children in part because it interfered with \"the power of\n\nparents to control the education of their own.\"          Id. at 401.     Two\n\nyears later, in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, the Court overturned\n\nan Oregon statute compelling children to attend public schools on\n\nthe grounds that the statute \"unreasonably interfere[d] with the\n\nliberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing of\n\nchildren under their control.\"         Id. at 534-35.    Plaintiffs argue\n\ntheir   request   for   notice   and   exemption   is   simply   a   logical\n\nextension of their parental rights under Meyer and Pierce, as\n\nreinforced by their free exercise rights.\n\n           Defendants respond that plaintiffs' argument runs afoul\n\nof the general proposition that, while parents can choose between\n\npublic and private schools, they do not have a constitutional right\n\nto \"direct how a public school teaches their child.\"         Blau v. Fort\n\nThomas Pub. Sch. Dist., 401 F.3d 381, 395 (6th Cir. 2005).              That\n\nproposition is well recognized.        See, e.g., C.N., 430 F.3d at 184\n\n(recognizing a \"distinction between actions that strike at the\n\nheart of parental decision-making authority on matters of the\n\ngreatest importance and other actions that, although perhaps unwise\n\nand offensive, are not of constitutional dimension\"); Leebaert, 332\n\nF.3d at 141 (\"Meyer, Pierce, and their progeny do not begin to\n\nsuggest the existence of a fundamental right of every parent to\n\ntell a public school what his or her child will and will not be\n\ntaught.\"); Littlefield v. Forney Indep. Sch. Dist., 268 F.3d 275,\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\f291 (5th Cir. 2001) (\"It has long been recognized that parental\n\nrights are not absolute in the public school context and can be\n\nsubject to reasonable regulation.\"); Swanson, 135 F.3d at 699 (\"The\n\ncase law in this area establishes that parents simply do not have\n\na constitutional right to control each and every aspect of their\n\nchildren's education . . . .\"); see also Fields v. Palmdale Sch.\n\nDist., 427 F.3d 1197, 1207 (9th Cir. 2005), amended by 447 F.3d\n\n1187 (9th Cir. 2006).     Indeed, Meyer and Pierce specified that the\n\nparental interests they recognized would not interfere with the\n\ngeneral power of the state to regulate education, including \"the\n\nstate's power to prescribe a curriculum for institutions which it\n\nsupports.\"      Meyer, 262 U.S. at 402; see also Pierce, 268 U.S. at\n\n534.\n\n           Plaintiffs say, in response, that they are not attempting\n\nto control the school's power to prescribe a curriculum.                The\n\nplaintiffs accept that the school system \"has a legitimate secular\n\ninterest in seeking to eradicate bias against same-gender couples\n\nand to ensure the safety of all public school students.\"                They\n\nassert   that    they   have   an   equally   sincere   interest   in   the\n\naccommodation of their own religious beliefs and of the diversity\n\nrepresented by their contrary views.            Plaintiffs specifically\n\ndisclaim any intent to seek control of the school's curriculum or\n\nto impose their will on others.         They do not seek to change the\n\nchoice of books available to others but only to require notice of\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\fthe books and an exemption, and even then only up to the seventh\n\ngrade.     Nonetheless, we have found no federal case under the Due\n\nProcess Clause which has permitted parents to demand an exemption\n\nfor their children from exposure to certain books used in public\n\nschools.\n\n            The due process right of parental autonomy might be\n\nconsidered a subset of a broader substantive due process right of\n\nfamilial privacy.     See M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 116 (1996).\n\nThe other cases establishing privacy rights under the Due Process\n\nClause pertain to such issues as the right to marry, e.g., Loving\n\nv. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967) (state cannot outlaw miscegenation),\n\nand the right to procreate, e.g., Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535\n\n(1942) (state cannot forcibly sterilize convicts), and are not\n\nrelevant to plaintiffs' claims.          In sum, the substantive due\n\nprocess clause by itself, either in its parental control or its\n\nprivacy focus, does not give plaintiffs the degree of control over\n\ntheir children's education that their requested relief seeks.          We\n\nturn then to whether the combination of substantive due process and\n\nfree exercise interests give the parents a cause of action.\n\n            The First Amendment's prohibition on laws \"respecting an\n\nestablishment    of   religion,   or   prohibiting   the   free   exercise\n\nthereof\" applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nCantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940).         In Smith, the\n\nSupreme Court noted that the \"free exercise of religion means,\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\ffirst and foremost, the right to believe and profess whatever\n\nreligious doctrine one desires.\"               494 U.S. at 877.   As a result,\n\nthe government may not, for example, (1) compel affirmation of\n\nreligious beliefs; (2) punish the expression of religious doctrines\n\nit believes to be false; (3) impose special disabilities on the\n\nbasis of religious views or religious status; or (4) lend its power\n\nto   one    side   or   the    other     in    controversies   over   religious\n\nauthorities or dogma.         Id.16\n\n             The Free Exercise Clause, importantly, is not a general\n\nprotection of religion or religious belief.              It has a more limited\n\nreach of protecting the free exercise of religion.                In Lyng, the\n\nCourt noted that there and in Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693 (1986), no\n\nfree    exercise   claim      was     stated   even   though   \"the   challenged\n\nGovernment    action    would       interfere    significantly    with   private\n\npersons' ability to pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their\n\nown religious beliefs.\"             485 U.S. at 449.       There was no free\n\nexercise problem in those cases because \"[i]n neither case . . .\n\n\n\n       16\n          While this case is not a funding case, the Court has most\nrecently held that in such cases there is no significant burden on\nfree exercise rights where, as here, the government has \"impose[d]\nneither criminal nor civil sanctions on any type of religious\nservice or rite,\" and where it \"does not require students to choose\nbetween their religious beliefs and receiving a government\nbenefit.\" Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712, 720-21 (2004). As here,\nthe government in Locke made no attempt to regulate the plaintiffs'\nconduct. Id.; see D. Laycock, Supreme Court, 2003 Term -- Case\nComment: Theology Scholarships, the Pledge of Allegiance, and\nReligious Liberty: Avoiding the Extremes but Missing the Liberty,\n118 Harv. L. Rev. 155, 214-15 (2004).\n\n                                        -33-\n\fwould the affected individuals be coerced by the Government's\n\naction into violating their religious beliefs.\"      Id.   As the Court\n\nsaid in Roy, \"[n]ever to our knowledge has the Court interpreted\n\nthe First Amendment to require the Government itself to behave in\n\nways that the individual believes will further his or her spiritual\n\ndevelopment or that of his or her family.\"       476 U.S. at 699; see\n\nalso Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 412 (Douglas, J., concurring) (\"[T]he\n\nFree Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the government\n\ncannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the individual\n\ncan exact from the government.\").      Specifically, \"it is necessary\n\nin a free exercise case for one to show the coercive effect of the\n\nenactment as it operates against him in the practice of his\n\nreligion.\"   Schempp, 374 U.S. at 223.\n\n          Preliminarily,   we   mark   the   distinction   between   the\n\nalleged burden on the parents' free exercise rights and the alleged\n\nburden on their children's.     The right of parents \"to direct the\n\nreligious upbringing of their children,\"      Yoder, 406 U.S. at 233,\n\nis distinct from (although related to) any right their children\n\nmight have regarding the content of their school curriculum.         See\n\nElk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 16-18 (2004)\n\n(where father lacked legal power to sue on behalf of his daughter,\n\nhe could assert a right to influence her religious upbringing but\n\nlacked standing to challenge her exposure to ideas presented to her\n\nby third parties).     But see id. at 24 n.2 (Rehnquist, C.J.,\n\n\n                                -34-\n\fconcurring in the judgment) (Newdow's right should not be treated\n\nas distinct from his daughter's).             This is not a new distinction.\n\nIn   Prince    v.   Massachusetts,      321   U.S.    158   (1944),    the   Court\n\nexplained that \"two claimed liberties are at stake.                   One is the\n\nparent's, to bring up the child in the way [the parent desires],\n\nwhich for appellant means to teach him the tenets and the practices\n\nof their faith.       The other freedom is the child's, to observe these\n\n[tenets and practices].\"           Id. at 164; see also Fleischfresser, 15\n\nF.3d at 683-84.       We start with the parents' claim.\n\n              Generally, the fundamental parental control/free exercise\n\nclaims regarding public schools have fallen into several types of\n\nsituations: claims that failure to provide benefits given to public\n\nschool     students     violates    free   exercise    rights,17   claims     that\n\nplaintiffs     should    not   be   subjected    to   compulsory      education,18\n\ndemands for removal of offensive material from the curriculum,19\n\n\n      17\n          See, e.g., Gary S. v. Manchester Sch. Dist., 374 F.3d 15,\n19-21 (1st Cir. 2004); Swanson, 135 F.3d at 698, 702 (no due\nprocess or free exercise violation in school district's refusal to\nallow home-schooled students to attend public schools part-time).\n      18\n          See, e.g., Yoder, 406 U.S. 205; Murphy v. Arkansas, 852\nF.2d 1039 (8th Cir. 1988) (no due process or free exercise\nviolation in state setting requirements for home schooling); Duro\nv. Dist. Attorney, 712 F.2d 96 (4th Cir. 1983) (no Yoder-like\nconstitutional problem with state statute prohibiting home\nschooling).\n      19\n          See, e.g., Williams v. Bd. of Educ., 388 F. Supp. 93 (D.\nW. Va. 1975) (no violation of free exercise or privacy rights in\nschool's use of textbooks that offend plaintiffs' religious\nbeliefs). The amici's attempts to fit plaintiffs' claim into this\nthird type -- removal of material from the school's curriculum --\n\n                                       -35-\n\fand, as here, claims that there is a constitutional right to\n\nexemption from religiously offensive material.20               See also M.\n\nStewart,    The    First    Amendment,   the   Public    Schools,     and   the\n\nInculcation of Community Values, 18 J. L. & Educ. 23, 86 (1989).\n\n            In two cases in which plaintiffs did not raise a related\n\nparental rights due process claim, federal courts have rejected\n\nfree    exercise    claims     seeking   exemptions     from   the    schools'\n\nassignment of particular books.          In Fleischfresser, the parents\n\nsought to prevent the use of the Impressions Reading Series as a\n\nsupplemental reading program for an elementary school.               15 F.3d at\n\n683.    The parents complained that the series fostered a belief in\n\nthe existence of superior beings and indoctrinated their children\n\nin values such as despair, deceit, and parental disrespect, values\n\ndifferent from their Christian beliefs.           Id. at 683, 689.          The\n\nSeventh Circuit held that any burden on free exercise rights was,\n\nat most, minimal.          The parents were not precluded from meeting\n\ntheir religious obligation to instruct their children, nor were the\n\n\n\nfails. Plaintiffs do not claim a general right of censorship, only\nthat they have a right to notice and exemption.\n       20\n          See, e.g., Leebaert, 332 F.3d 134 (no free exercise or\nparental due process right violated by school's refusal to exempt\nstudent from mandatory health class); Littlefield, 268 F.3d 275 (no\nparental due process or free exercise violation in refusal to\nexempt child from mandatory uniform policy); Morrison ex rel.\nMorrison v. Bd. of Educ., 419 F. Supp. 2d 937 (E.D. Ky. 2006) (no\nright to exempt child from mandatory school diversity training on\nhomosexuality), rev'd on other grounds, 507 F.3d 494 (6th Cir.\n2007).\n\n                                     -36-\n\fparents or children compelled to do anything or refrain from doing\n\nanything of a religious nature.         Thus, no coercion existed.       Id. at\n\n690.\n\n              In Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of Education, 827 F.2d\n\n1058 (6th Cir. 1987), which is more factually similar to this case,\n\nthe Sixth Circuit rejected a broader claim for an exemption from a\n\nschool district's use of an entire series of texts.             The parents in\n\nthat   case    asserted   that   the   books    in   question   taught   values\n\ncontrary to their religious beliefs and that, as a result, the\n\nschool violated the parents' religious beliefs by allowing their\n\nchildren to read the books and violated their children's religious\n\nbeliefs by requiring the children to read them.            Id. at 1060.     The\n\ncourt, however, found that exposure to ideas through the required\n\nreading of books did not constitute a constitutionally significant\n\nburden on the plaintiffs' free exercise of religion.             Id. at 1065.\n\nIn so holding, the court emphasized that \"the evil prohibited by\n\nthe Free Exercise Clause\" is \"governmental compulsion either to do\n\nor refrain from doing an act forbidden or required by one's\n\nreligion, or to affirm or disavow a belief forbidden or required by\n\none's religion,\" and reading or even discussing the books did not\n\ncompel such action or affirmation.            Id. at 1066, 1069.\n\n              In the present case, the plaintiffs claim that the\n\nexposure of their children, at these young ages and in this\n\nsetting, to ways of life contrary to the parents' religious beliefs\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fviolates their ability to direct the religious upbringing of their\n\nchildren.   We try to identify the categories of harms alleged.   The\n\nparents do not allege coercion in the form of a direct interference\n\nwith their religious beliefs, nor of compulsion in the form of\n\npunishment for their beliefs, as in Yoder.   Nor do they allege the\n\ndenial of benefits.    Further, plaintiffs do not allege that the\n\nmere listening to a book being read violated any religious duty on\n\nthe part of the child.    There is no claim that as a condition of\n\nattendance at the public schools, the defendants have forced\n\nplaintiffs -- either the parents or the children -- to violate\n\ntheir religious beliefs.     In sum there is no claim of direct\n\ncoercion.\n\n            The heart of the plaintiffs' free exercise claim is a\n\nclaim of \"indoctrination\": that the state has put pressure on their\n\nchildren to endorse an affirmative view of gay marriage and has\n\nthus undercut the parents' efforts to inculcate their children with\n\ntheir own opposing religious views. The Supreme Court, we believe,\n\nhas never utilized an indoctrination test under the Free Exercise\n\nClause, much less in the public school context.   The closest it has\n\ncome is Barnette, a free speech case that implicated free exercise\n\ninterests and which Smith included in its hybrid case discussion.\n\nIn Barnette, the Court held that the state could not coerce\n\nacquiescence through compelled statements of belief, such as the\n\nmandatory recital of the pledge of allegiance in public schools.\n\n\n                                -38-\n\f319 U.S. at 634, 642.      It did not hold that the state could not\n\nattempt to inculcate values by instruction, and in fact carefully\n\ndistinguished the two approaches.             Id. at 631, 640; see also\n\nStewart, supra, at 74.           We do not address whether or not an\n\nindoctrination theory under the Free Exercise Clause is sound.\n\nPlaintiffs'   pleadings     do     not    establish      a    viable   case    of\n\nindoctrination, even assuming that extreme indoctrination can be a\n\nform of coercion.\n\n           First, as to the parents' free exercise rights, the mere\n\nfact that a child is exposed on occasion in public school to a\n\nconcept offensive to a parent's religious belief does not inhibit\n\nthe parent from instructing the child differently.              A parent whose\n\n\"child is exposed to sensitive topics or information [at school]\n\nremains free to discuss these matters and to place them in the\n\nfamily's   moral    or   religious       context,   or   to    supplement     the\n\ninformation with more appropriate materials.\"                C.N., 430 F.3d at\n\n185; see also Newdow, 542 U.S. at 16 (noting that the school's\n\nrequirement that Newdow's daughter recite the pledge of allegiance\n\nevery day did not \"impair[] Newdow's right to instruct his daughter\n\nin his religious views\").          The parents here did in fact have\n\nnotice, if not prior notice, of the books and of the school's\n\noverall intent to promote toleration of same-sex marriage, and they\n\nretained their ability to discuss the material and subject matter\n\n\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\fwith their children.      Our outcome does not turn, however, on\n\nwhether the parents had notice.\n\n            Turning to the children's free exercise rights, we cannot\n\nsee how Jacob's free exercise right was burdened at all: two books\n\nwere made available to him, but he was never required to read them\n\nor have them read to him.    Further, these books do not endorse gay\n\nmarriage or homosexuality, or even address these topics explicitly,\n\nbut merely describe how other children might come from families\n\nthat look different from one's own.      There is no free exercise\n\nright to be free from any reference in public elementary schools to\n\nthe existence of families in which the parents are of different\n\ngender combinations.\n\n            Joey has a more significant claim, both because he was\n\nrequired to sit through a classroom reading of King and King and\n\nbecause that book affirmatively endorses homosexuality and gay\n\nmarriage.   It is a fair inference that the reading of King and King\n\nwas precisely intended to influence the listening children toward\n\ntolerance of gay marriage.   That was the point of why that book was\n\nchosen and used.   Even assuming there is a continuum along which an\n\nintent to influence could become an attempt to indoctrinate,\n\nhowever, this case is firmly on the influence-toward-tolerance end.\n\nThere is no evidence of systemic indoctrination.        There is no\n\nallegation that Joey was asked to affirm gay marriage.     Requiring\n\n\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\fa student to read a particular book is generally not coercive of\n\nfree exercise rights.\n\n            Public schools are not obliged to shield individual\n\nstudents from ideas which potentially are religiously offensive,\n\nparticularly when the school imposes no requirement that the\n\nstudent agree with or affirm those ideas, or even participate in\n\ndiscussions about them.              See Fleischfresser, 15 F.3d at 690;\n\nMozert, 827 F.2d at 1063-65, 1070; see also Bauchman, 132 F.3d at\n\n558    (\"[P]ublic      schools   are    not     required    to   delete   from    the\n\ncurriculum       all     materials      that     may   offend     any     religious\n\nsensibility.\"       (quoting Florey v.

The reading of King and King was not instruction in\n\nreligion or religious beliefs.21                Cf. Barnette, 319 U.S. at 631\n\n(distinguishing between compelling students to declare a belief\n\nthrough mandatory recital of the pledge of allegiance, which\n\nviolates free exercise, and \"merely . . . acquaint[ing students]\n\nwith the flag salute so that they may be informed as to what it is\n\nor even what it means\").\n\n            On     the     facts,       there     is   no    viable       claim   of\n\n\"indoctrination\" here. Without suggesting that such showings would\n\n\n       21\n          Indeed, in Schempp the Court suggested that even if a\nseries of mandatory classroom Bible readings violated the Free\nExercise Clause, the study of the Bible or religion, if \"presented\nobjectively as part of a secular program of education, may [] be\neffected consistently with the First Amendment.\" 374 U.S. at 225.\n\n                                         -41-\n\fsuffice   to    establish     a    claim   of   indoctrination,       we   note   the\n\nplaintiffs' children were not forced to read the books on pain of\n\nsuspension.      Nor were they subject to a constant stream of like\n\nmaterials.      There is no allegation here of a formalized curriculum\n\nrequiring students to read many books affirming gay marriage.                     Cf.\n\nMozert, 827 F.2d at 1079 (Boggs, J., concurring) (concluding that\n\nsuch facts could constitute a burden on free exercise, although\n\nsuch a burden would be constitutionally permissible in the public\n\nschool    context     if    parents    still     retained     other    educational\n\noptions).      The reading by a teacher of one book, or even three, and\n\neven if to a young and impressionable child, does not constitute\n\n\"indoctrination.\"\n\n             Because plaintiffs do not allege facts that give rise to\n\nclaims of constitutional magnitude, the district court did not err\n\nin granting defendants' motion to dismiss the claims under the U.S.\n\nConstitution.\n\n                                       III.\n\n             Public schools often walk a tightrope between the many\n\ncompeting      constitutional       demands     made    by   parents,      students,\n\nteachers, and the schools' other constituents.

The balance\n\nthe school struck here does not offend the Free Exercise or Due\n\nProcess Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n            We do not suggest that the school's choice of books for\n\nyoung students has not deeply offended the plaintiffs' sincerely\n\nheld   religious     beliefs.       If     the     school      system    has    been\n\ninsufficiently sensitive to such religious beliefs, the plaintiffs\n\nmay seek recourse to the normal political processes for change in\n\nthe town and state.

Two     sets    of   parents,   whose\n\nreligious beliefs are offended by gay marriage and homosexuality,\n\nsued the Lexington, Massachusetts school district in which their\n\nyoung children are enrolled.          They assert that they must be given\n\nprior notice by the school and the opportunity to exempt their\n\nyoung   children     from   exposure    to    books    they    find    religiously\n\nrepugnant.    Plaintiffs asserted violations of their own and their\n\nchildren's   rights     under   the    Free    Exercise       Clause    and   their\n\nsubstantive parental and privacy due process rights under the U.S.\n\nConstitution.\n\n            The Parkers object to their child being presented in\n\nkindergarten and first grade with two books that portray diverse\n\nfamilies, including families in which both parents are of the same\n\ngender.   The Wirthlins object to a second-grade teacher's reading\n\nto their son's class a book that depicts and celebrates a gay\n\nmarriage.    The parents do not challenge the use of these books as\n\npart of a nondiscrimination curriculum in the public schools, but\n\nchallenge the school district's refusal to provide them with prior\n\nnotice and to allow for exemption from such instruction.                  They ask\n\nfor relief until their children are in seventh grade.\n\n            Massachusetts does have a statute that requires parents\n\nbe given notice and the opportunity to exempt their children from\n\ncurriculum which primarily involves human sexual education or human\n\nsexuality issues.

Massachusetts Statewide Curricular Standards\n\n            The Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted a comprehensive\n\neducation    reform    bill     in   1993,    requiring   the   State      Board   of\n\nEducation (SBE) to establish academic standards for core subjects.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 69, § 1D.                 The statute mandates that the\n\nstandards \"be designed to inculcate respect for the cultural,\n\nethnic and racial diversity of the commonwealth.\"                   Id.    Further,\n\n\"[a]cademic standards shall be designed to avoid perpetuating\n\ngender, cultural, ethnic or racial stereotypes.\" Id.; see also id.\n\n§    1E   (requiring     same    for   the     establishment        of    curricular\n\nframeworks).      The statute does not specify sexual orientation in\n\nthese lists.\n\n            The    SBE    established        such    standards,      including      a\n\nComprehensive Health Curriculum Framework in 1999.                  That Framework\n\nestablishes Learning Standards, which set different measurable\n\ngoals for students in pre-kindergarten through grade 5, grades 6-8,\n\nand grades 9-12. The Health Framework also specifically notes that\n\n\"public schools must notify parents before implementing curriculum\n\nthat involves human sexuality.\"\n\n            Within     the    Framework      are   Strands,   and    Strands   have\n\ndifferent components.           Under the Social and Emotional Health\n\nStrand, there is a Family Life component, which states:\n\n            Students   will  gain   knowledge  about  the\n            significance of the family on individuals and\n            society, and will learn skills to support the\n            family, balance work and family life, be an\n\n                                        -5-\n\f             effective parent, and nurture the development of\n             children.\n\nThe Learning Standard for elementary school grades under the Family\n\nLife component states that children should be able to \"[d]escribe\n\ndifferent types of families.\"\n\n             In addition, the Social and Emotional Health Strand\n\nincludes an Interpersonal Relationships component.          That component\n\nprovides:\n\n             Students will learn that relationships with\n             others are an integral part of the human life\n             experience and the factors that contribute to\n             healthy interpersonal relationships, and will\n             acquire skills to enhance and make many of these\n             relationships more fulfilling through commitment\n             and communication.\n\nThe associated Learning Standard for pre-kindergarten through grade\n\n5 recommends that children be able to \"[d]escribe the concepts of\n\nprejudice and discrimination.\"\n\n             It is not until grades 6-8 that the Learning Standards\n\nunder this component address \"the detrimental effect of prejudice\n\n(such   as    prejudice   on   the    basis   of   race,   gender,   sexual\n\norientation, class, or religion) on individual relationships and\n\nsociety as a whole.\"\n\n             There is also a Reproduction/Sexuality component under\n\nthe Physical Health Strand.          Within that component, the Learning\n\nStandards provide that by grade 5, students should be able to\n\n\"[d]efine sexual orientation using the correct terminology (such as\n\nheterosexual, and gay and lesbian).\"\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            These statewide academic standards do not purport to\n\nselect particular instructional materials, but only to be a guide\n\nto assist others in that selection.                Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 69, § 1E.\n\nThus, there is no statewide regulation or policy providing for the\n\nuse of the particular texts in dispute here.\n\n            By    statute,     the    actual       selection     of    books     is   the\n\nresponsibility of a school's principal, with the approval of the\n\nsuperintendent of schools.             Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, § 48.                   We\n\nassume these books were chosen locally subject to the terms of that\n\nstatute.       Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that Lexington\n\nschool officials began integrating books like these into their\n\nelementary      school's     curriculum       at   the    behest      of   gay   rights\n\nadvocates.      Compl. ¶¶ 32-33.\n\n            In 1996, the Massachusetts legislature adopted a parental\n\nnotification statute to be implemented by schools starting with the\n\n1997-1998 school year.         Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, § 32A.              Section 32A\n\nrequires school districts to provide parents with notice of and an\n\nopportunity      to   exempt    their    children        from    \"curriculum      which\n\nprimarily      involves     human    sexual    education        or   human   sexuality\n\nissues.\"     The Commissioner of Education, in an advisory opinion\n\nguiding the implementation of the new law, noted that it was\n\nintended to apply to discrete curricular units, such as \"any\n\ncourses (typically, sex education or portions of a health education\n\nor   science     course),    school     assemblies       or   other    instructional\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\factivities       and    programs.\"2     Schools   must   make    the   relevant\n\ncurricular materials available for parents to review, though they\n\ndo not necessarily have to allow parents to observe the classes.\n\nThe statute mandates that the Department of Education promulgate\n\nregulations for resolving any disputes arising under section 32A,\n\nwhich the Department has done.           See 603 Mass. Code Regs. 5.01 et\n\nseq.       Lexington has a section 32A policy in place.\n\n               On November 18, 2003, a divided Supreme Judicial Court of\n\nMassachusetts held, in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 2003), that the state constitution mandates\n\nthe recognition of same-sex marriage.             A later effort to reverse\n\nthis decision through the mechanism of a constitutional convention\n\nand a popular vote failed.\n\nB.             The Parkers\n\n               David and Tonia Parker's sons, Jacob and Joshua Parker,\n\nand Joseph and Robin Wirthlin's son, Joseph Robert Wirthlin, Jr.,\n\nare    students        at   Estabrook   Elementary   School     in   Lexington,\n\nMassachusetts.         Both families assert that they are devout Judeo-\n\nChristians and that a core belief of their religion is that\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          That statute has been interpreted in an opinion letter by\nthe Department of Education not to apply to educational materials\ndesigned to promote tolerance, including materials recognizing\ndifferences in sexual orientation, if those materials are presented\n\"without further instruction or discussion of the physical and\nsexual implications of homosexuality.\"\n\n                                        -8-\n\fhomosexual behavior and gay marriage are immoral and violate God's\n\nlaw.\n\n            In January 2005, when Jacob Parker (\"Jacob\") was in\n\nkindergarten,      he   brought      home    a     \"Diversity    Book   Bag.\"       This\n\nincluded    a    picture     book,   Who's        in   a   Family?,   which   depicted\n\ndifferent families, including single-parent families, an extended\n\nfamily, interracial families, animal families, a family without\n\nchildren, and -- to the concern of the Parkers -- a family with two\n\ndads and a family with two moms.                 The book concludes by answering\n\nthe question, \"Who's in a family?\": \"The people who love you the\n\nmost!\"    The book says nothing about marriage.\n\n            The Parkers were concerned that this book was part of an\n\neffort by the public schools \"to indoctrinate young children into\n\nthe concept that homosexuality and homosexual relationships or\n\nmarriage are moral and acceptable behavior.\"                   Compl. ¶ 30.     Such an\n\neffort, they feared, would require their sons to affirm a belief\n\ninconsistent with their religion.                 Id. ¶ 33.    On January 21, 2005,\n\nthey met with Estabrook's principal, Joni Jay (\"Jay\"), to request\n\nthat     Jacob   not    be    exposed       to     any     further    discussions    of\n\nhomosexuality.         Principal Jay disagreed that the school had any\n\nobligation under section 32A to notify parents in advance of such\n\nclass discussions.           In March 2005, the Parkers repeated their\n\nrequest that \"no teacher or adult expose [Jacob] to any materials\n\nor discussions featuring sexual orientation, same-sex unions, or\n\n                                            -9-\n\fhomosexuality without notification to the Parkers and the right to\n\n'opt out,'\" this time including in their communication the then-\n\nSuperintendent of Lexington's schools, William Hurley (\"Hurley\"),\n\nand two other district-wide administrators.        Id. ¶ 34.   This\n\nrequest was met with the same response.      A further meeting to\n\ndiscuss these issues was held at Estabrook on April 27, 2005, which\n\nresulted in Mr. Parker's arrest when he refused to leave the school\n\nuntil his demands were met.\n\n          As the 2005-2006 school year began, Paul Ash (\"Ash\"), the\n\ncurrent Superintendent, released a public statement explaining the\n\nschool district's position that it would not provide parental\n\nnotification for \"discussions, activities, or materials that simply\n\nreference same-gender parents or that otherwise recognize the\n\nexistence of differences in sexual orientation.\"        When Jacob\n\nentered first grade that fall, his classroom's book collection\n\nincluded Who's in a Family? as well as Molly's Family, a picture\n\nbook about a girl who is at first made to feel embarrassed by a\n\nclassmate because she has both a mommy and a mama but then learns\n\nthat families can come in many different varieties.     In December\n\n2005, the Parkers repeated their request for advance notice, which\n\nSuperintendent Ash again denied.\n\nC.        The Wirthlins\n\n          We turn to the other plaintiff family.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f          In March 2006, an Estabrook teacher read aloud King and\n\nKing to her second grade class, which included Joseph Robert\n\nWirthlin, Jr. (\"Joey\").    This picture book tells the story of a\n\nprince, ordered by his mother to get married, who first rejects\n\nseveral princesses only to fall in love with another prince.      A\n\nwedding scene between the two princes is depicted.    The last page\n\nof the book shows the two princes kissing, but with a red heart\n\nsuperimposed over their mouths.      There is no allegation in the\n\ncomplaint that the teacher further discussed the book with the\n\nclass.   That evening, Joey told his parents about the book; his\n\nparents described him as \"agitated\" and remembered him calling the\n\nbook \"so silly.\"   Id. ¶ 57.   Eventually the Wirthlins were able to\n\nsecure a meeting with the teacher and Jay on April 6, 2006, to\n\nobject to what they considered to be indoctrination of their son\n\nabout gay marriage in contravention of their religious beliefs.\n\nJay reiterated the school district's position that no prior notice\n\nor exemption would be given.\n\nD.        Procedural History\n\n          On April 27, 2006, the Parkers and the Wirthlins filed\n\nsuit on behalf of themselves and their children in federal district\n\ncourt against Hurley, Ash, Jay, and Joey Wirthlin's teacher, as\n\nwell as the town of Lexington, the members of its school board, and\n\nother school district administrators.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            The   complaint   alleges    that   the   public   schools   are\n\nsystematically indoctrinating the Parkers' and the Wirthlins' young\n\nchildren contrary to the parents' religious beliefs and that the\n\ndefendants held \"a specific intention to denigrate the [families']\n\nsincere and deeply-held faith.\"         Id. ¶ 66.     They claim, under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, violations of their and their children's First\n\nAmendment right to the free exercise of religion and of their\n\nFourteenth Amendment due process right to parental autonomy in the\n\nupbringing of their children, as well as of their concomitant state\n\nrights.3    They also assert a violation of the Massachusetts \"opt\n\nout\" statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, § 32A.\n\n            The plaintiffs argue that their ability to influence\n\ntheir young children toward their family religious views has been\n\nundercut in several respects.      First, they believe their children\n\nare too young to be introduced to the topic of gay marriage.             They\n\nalso point to the important influence teachers have on this age\n\ngroup.     They fear their own inability as parents to counter the\n\nschool's approval of gay marriage, particularly if parents are\n\n\n\n     3\n          The plaintiffs also claim that defendants violated § 1983\nby conspiring to deprive them of these constitutional rights. They\ndo not assert an Establishment Clause claim.\n          We note that the Supreme Judicial Court has held that the\nMassachusetts state constitution provides greater protection for\nfree exercise claims then does the federal constitution. Attorney\nGen. v. Desilets, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235-36 (Mass. 1994). Plaintiffs\nbrought their suit in federal court and have chosen not to request\ncertification of any state law issues to the Supreme Judicial\nCourt.\n\n                                  -12-\n\f  given no notice that such curricular materials are in use.           As\n\nfor the children, the parents fear that they are \"essentially\"\n\nrequired \"to affirm a belief inconsistent with and prohibited by\n\ntheir religion.\"       Compl. ¶ 33.     The parents assert it is ironic,\n\nand unconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause, for a public\n\nschool system to show such intolerance towards their own religious\n\nbeliefs in the name of tolerance.\n\n              For relief, the plaintiffs seek a declaration of their\n\nconstitutional rights; damages; and an injunction requiring the\n\nschool (1) to provide an opportunity to exempt their children from\n\n\"classroom presentations or discussions the intent of which is to\n\nhave children accept the validity of, embrace, affirm, or celebrate\n\nviews    of    human    sexuality,     gender   identity,   and   marriage\n\nconstructs,\" (2) to allow the parents to observe any such classroom\n\ndiscussions, and (3) to not present any \"materials graphically\n\ndepicting homosexual physical contact\" to students before the\n\nseventh grade.4\n\n              The defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a\n\nclaim upon which relief could           be granted.    Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6). After hearing oral arguments, the district court granted\n\n\n     4\n          In the request for injunctive relief, plaintiffs also\nsought an opt-out right regarding \"classroom presentations or\ndiscussions when the intent is to have children accept the validity\nof, embrace, affirm or celebrate belief systems or religious\nperspectives.\" Because the complaint does not allege any instance\nof such a classroom presentation or discussion, we do not further\nconsider this particular claim for relief.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fthe defendants' motion on February 23, 2007.                 The court dismissed\n\nthe state claims without prejudice so that they could be reasserted\n\nin state court.        Parker, 474 F. Supp. 2d at 263.\n\n             As to the federal claims, the district court found this\n\ncase indistinguishable from Brown v.

In Brown, this circuit held that the\n\nFree Exercise Clause and the parents' substantive due process\n\nrights were not violated by one instance of a school system's\n\nfailure to provide prior notice and an exemption for a specific\n\nhigh school assembly on human sexuality.                Holding that Brown was\n\nanalytically identical to the present case, the district court\n\napplied rational basis review and concluded that the state's\n\ninterest in preventing discrimination, specifically discrimination\n\ntargeted     at    students   in    school,      justified   the   policy   of   the\n\nLexington schools.

See Otero, 441 F.3d at 20.\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f           There are several ways to approach the parents' claim\n\ndepending upon how this case is categorized.            One could start by\n\nasking how strong the school's interest must be to justify the\n\ndenial of the parents' request for an exemption (as opposed to\n\nasking about the nature of the plaintiffs' interests, as we do\n\nbelow).   The parties have focused on the standard of justification\n\nthe defendants must meet in the aftermath of Employment Division v.\n\nSmith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990).      What is clear from Smith is that not\n\nall free exercise challenges will survive motions to dismiss and\n\nnot all will receive strict scrutiny review.\n\n           One possible answer is that, under Smith, the school may\n\nhave to show no more than that its choice of books and its refusal\n\nto provide exemption is rational. In Smith, the Court rejected the\n\nplaintiffs' claim that they had unconstitutionally been denied\n\nunemployment benefits due to their violation of Oregon's general\n\ncriminal prohibition on the use of peyote, even though they had\n\nused the peyote for religious purposes.        The Court found no free\n\nexercise objection to the criminal statute's enforcement because,\n\nas it summarized in a later case, \"a law that is neutral and of\n\ngeneral   applicability   need   not   be   justified    by   a   compelling\n\ngovernmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of\n\nburdening a particular religious practice.\"        Church of the Lukumi\n\nBabalu Aye, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs do not\n\ncontest   that   the   defendants    have   an   interest    in   promoting\n\ntolerance,   including   for   the    children   (and   parents)     of   gay\n\nmarriages.   The Supreme Court has often referred to the role of\n\npublic education in the preparation of students for citizenship.\n\nSee, e.g., Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111754\"><a href=\"/opinion/111754/bethel-school-dist-no-403-v-fraser/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 681-\n\n85 (1986) (upholding ability of schools to prohibit lewd speech).\n\nGiven that Massachusetts has recognized gay marriage under its\n\nstate constitution, it is entirely rational for its schools to\n\neducate their students regarding that recognition.5\n\n           In plaintiffs' favor, however, we will assume their case\n\nis not necessarily subject to this general Smith rule.            First, the\n\ncase does not arise in the same context as Smith.           Plaintiffs have\n\nnot engaged in conduct prohibited by state law or otherwise sought\n\nto avoid compliance with a law of general applicability.6           Nor does\n\n\n     5\n          We do not reach the question of whether there is a\ncompelling interest, either state or federal, in teaching tolerance\nfor gay marriage to elementary school students in the public school\nsystem.

Id. at 535. At\nleast four circuits have held that Smith is not limited to criminal\nprohibitions. Fairbanks v. Brackettville Bd. of Educ., No. 99-\n\n                                    -16-\n\fstate law or a formal policy require that the defendants take the\n\nactions they did.   Indeed, there is not even a formal, district-\n\nwide policy of affirming gay marriage through the use of such\n\neducational materials with young students.\n\n          In contrast to the mere rationality standard for neutral\n\nlaws of general applicability, Smith and its progeny require a\n\ncompelling justification for any law that targets religious groups.\n\nSee Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546 (invalidating law targeting religious\n\ngroup). This case also does not fit into the \"targeting\" category,\n\nas the Supreme Court has used the phrase.      The school was not\n\nsingling out plaintiffs' particular religious beliefs or targeting\n\nits tolerance lessons to only those children from families with\n\nreligious objections to gay marriage.    Cf. id. at 542.   The fact\n\nthat a school promotes tolerance of different sexual orientations\n\nand gay marriage when such tolerance is anathema to some religious\n\ngroups does not constitute targeting.\n\n          The Smith Court, in our view, left open other possible\n\napproaches.   The Court in Smith did not say it overruled any prior\n\nfree exercise cases.

Sex education as referred to in section 32A is usually\nset out as an independent course segment at prearranged times and\nplaces. Notice and exemption is thus far easier to accomplish. By\ncontrast, the notice and exemption requested here would require\nbroad advance notice of \"any adult-directed or initiated classroom\ndiscussions    of  sexuality,   gender   identity,   and   marriage\nconstructs,\" discussions that could arise often in almost any part\nof the curriculum.\n           Plaintiffs do point out, however, that because this case\nwas decided on a motion to dismiss, the defendants have put on no\nevidence that the school system would bear any burden if required\nto give them this notice and exemption.

In that case, the\n\nCourt did not analyze separately the due process and free exercise\n\ninterests of the parent-plaintiffs, but rather considered the two\n\nclaims interdependently, given that those two sets of interests\n\ninform one other.13   See Yoder, 406 U.S. at 213-14, 232-34.          We do\n\nnot need to resolve the hybrid rights debate because the level of\n\njustification the government must demonstrate -- a rational basis,\n\na compelling interest, or something in between -- is irrelevant in\n\nthis case.   While we accept as true plaintiffs' assertion that\n\ntheir sincerely held religious beliefs were deeply offended, we\n\nfind that they have not described a constitutional burden on their\n\nrights, or on those of their children.\n\n\n\n     13\n          While some have criticized the hybrid rights concept,\nsaying it tries to make something out of nothing, see Henderson,\n253 F.3d at 19 (\"[I]n law as in mathematics zero plus zero equals\nzero.\"), others have noted that \"it is equally true that the sum of\na number of fractions -- one-half plus one-half, for example -- may\nequal one,\" R.F.

In this case there is no pleading\n\nof a constitutionally significant burden on plaintiffs' rights.\n\n            In Yoder, the Court found unconstitutional Wisconsin's\n\napplication of its compulsory school attendance law to Amish\n\nparents    who   believed     that       any    education    beyond    eighth     grade\n\nundermined their entire, religiously focused way of life. 406 U.S.\n\nat   235-36.       The    heart     of    the    Yoder    opinion     is    a   lengthy\n\nconsideration of \"the interrelationship of belief with [the Amish]\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\fmode of life, the vital role that belief and daily conduct play in\n\nthe continued survival of Old Order Amish communities and their\n\nreligious organization,\" and how as a result compulsory high school\n\neducation    would    \"substantially     interfer[e]      with    the   religious\n\ndevelopment of the Amish child and his integration into the way of\n\nlife of the Amish faith community.\"           Id. at 218, 235.          The Court\n\nthus found Wisconsin's compulsory attendance law to be flatly\n\nincompatible with the plaintiffs' free exercise rights and parental\n\nliberty   interests,     which    it   considered    in   tandem.       That   is,\n\ncompulsory attendance at any school -- whether public, private, or\n\nhome-based -- prevented these Amish parents from making fundamental\n\ndecisions    regarding    their    children's      religious     upbringing    and\n\neffectively overrode their ability to pass their religion on to\n\ntheir children, as their faith required.            Id. at 233-35.       Further,\n\nthe   parents    in   Yoder   were     able   to    demonstrate     that    their\n\nalternative informal vocational training of their older children\n\nstill met the state's professed interest behind its compulsory\n\nattendance requirement.       Id. at 235.\n\n             To the extent that Yoder embodies judicial protection for\n\nsocial and religious \"sub-groups from the public cultivation of\n\nliberal tolerance,\" plaintiffs are correct to rely on it.                      See\n\nStolzenberg, supra, at 637.        But there are substantial differences\n\nbetween the plaintiffs' claims in Yoder and the claims raised in\n\nthis case.      One ground of distinction is that the plaintiffs have\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fchosen to place their children in public schools and do not live,\n\nas the Amish do, in a largely separate culture.               There are others.\n\nWhile plaintiffs do invoke Yoder's language that the state is\n\nthreatening their very \"way of life,\" they use this language to\n\nrefer to the centrality of these beliefs to their faith, in\n\ncontrast to its use in Yoder to refer to a distinct community and\n\nlife style.       Exposure to the materials in dispute here will not\n\nautomatically and irreversibly prevent the parents from raising\n\nJacob and Joey in the religious belief that gay marriage is\n\nimmoral.     Nor is there a criminal statute involved, or any other\n\npunishment imposed on the parents if they choose to educate their\n\nchildren in other ways. They retain options, unlike the parents in\n\nYoder.       Tellingly,       Yoder   emphasized     that     its    holding       was\n\nessentially sui generis, as few sects could make a similar showing\n\nof   a   unique    and   demanding     religious      way    of     life   that    is\n\nfundamentally incompatible with any schooling system.                  See Yoder,\n\n406 U.S. at 235-36.       Plaintiffs' case is not Yoder.\n\n            Despite defendants' contention, plaintiffs' case is also\n\nnot Brown.    Brown concerned a federal constitutional challenge to\n\na one-time failure by a Massachusetts high school to comply with\n\nthe notice and exemption procedures required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n71, § 32A, for a student's attendance at a discrete sex education\n\nassembly.      Brown     is    factually    and    legally    distinct.           Most\n\nsignificantly,      Brown     involved     the    education    of     high   school\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fstudents, not the education of kindergarten through second-grade\n\nstudents.    Educators treat this age differential as significant.\n\nThe statewide curricular standards themselves, including those\n\nrelated to sexual orientation, distinguish between elementary and\n\nhigh school students.    Further, as the plaintiffs sensibly point\n\nout, high school students are less responsive to what adults say\n\nthan are very young elementary school children.\n\n            The impressionability of young school children has been\n\nnoted as a relevant factor in the Establishment Clause context.\n\nSee, e.g., Lee v.

Indeed, Meyer and Pierce specified that the\n\nparental interests they recognized would not interfere with the\n\ngeneral power of the state to regulate education, including \"the\n\nstate's power to prescribe a curriculum for institutions which it\n\nsupports.\"      Meyer, 262 U.S. at 402; see also Pierce, 268 U.S. at\n\n534.\n\n           Plaintiffs say, in response, that they are not attempting\n\nto control the school's power to prescribe a curriculum.                The\n\nplaintiffs accept that the school system \"has a legitimate secular\n\ninterest in seeking to eradicate bias against same-gender couples\n\nand to ensure the safety of all public school students.\"                They\n\nassert   that    they   have   an   equally   sincere   interest   in   the\n\naccommodation of their own religious beliefs and of the diversity\n\nrepresented by their contrary views.            Plaintiffs specifically\n\ndisclaim any intent to seek control of the school's curriculum or\n\nto impose their will on others.         They do not seek to change the\n\nchoice of books available to others but only to require notice of\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\fthe books and an exemption, and even then only up to the seventh\n\ngrade.     Nonetheless, we have found no federal case under the Due\n\nProcess Clause which has permitted parents to demand an exemption\n\nfor their children from exposure to certain books used in public\n\nschools.\n\n            The due process right of parental autonomy might be\n\nconsidered a subset of a broader substantive due process right of\n\nfamilial privacy.

In sum, the substantive due\n\nprocess clause by itself, either in its parental control or its\n\nprivacy focus, does not give plaintiffs the degree of control over\n\ntheir children's education that their requested relief seeks.          We\n\nturn then to whether the combination of substantive due process and\n\nfree exercise interests give the parents a cause of action.\n\n            The First Amendment's prohibition on laws \"respecting an\n\nestablishment    of   religion,   or   prohibiting   the   free   exercise\n\nthereof\" applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nCantwell v.

In Smith, the\n\nSupreme Court noted that the \"free exercise of religion means,\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\ffirst and foremost, the right to believe and profess whatever\n\nreligious doctrine one desires.\"               494 U.S. at 877.   As a result,\n\nthe government may not, for example, (1) compel affirmation of\n\nreligious beliefs; (2) punish the expression of religious doctrines\n\nit believes to be false; (3) impose special disabilities on the\n\nbasis of religious views or religious status; or (4) lend its power\n\nto   one    side   or   the    other     in    controversies   over   religious\n\nauthorities or dogma.         Id.16\n\n             The Free Exercise Clause, importantly, is not a general\n\nprotection of religion or religious belief.              It has a more limited\n\nreach of protecting the free exercise of religion.                In Lyng, the\n\nCourt noted that there and in Bowen v.

There was no free\n\nexercise problem in those cases because \"[i]n neither case . . .\n\n\n\n       16\n          While this case is not a funding case, the Court has most\nrecently held that in such cases there is no significant burden on\nfree exercise rights where, as here, the government has \"impose[d]\nneither criminal nor civil sanctions on any type of religious\nservice or rite,\" and where it \"does not require students to choose\nbetween their religious beliefs and receiving a government\nbenefit.\" Locke v.

Thus, no coercion existed.       Id. at\n\n690.\n\n              In Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493641\"><a href=\"/opinion/493641/bob-alice-mozert-individually-and-as-guardians-ad-litem-for-travis/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1987), which is more factually similar to this case,\n\nthe Sixth Circuit rejected a broader claim for an exemption from a\n\nschool district's use of an entire series of texts.             The parents in\n\nthat   case    asserted   that   the   books    in   question   taught   values\n\ncontrary to their religious beliefs and that, as a result, the\n\nschool violated the parents' religious beliefs by allowing their\n\nchildren to read the books and violated their children's religious\n\nbeliefs by requiring the children to read them.            Id. at 1060.     The\n\ncourt, however, found that exposure to ideas through the required\n\nreading of books did not constitute a constitutionally significant\n\nburden on the plaintiffs' free exercise of religion.             Id. at 1065.\n\nIn so holding, the court emphasized that \"the evil prohibited by\n\nthe Free Exercise Clause\" is \"governmental compulsion either to do\n\nor refrain from doing an act forbidden or required by one's\n\nreligion, or to affirm or disavow a belief forbidden or required by\n\none's religion,\" and reading or even discussing the books did not\n\ncompel such action or affirmation.            Id. at 1066, 1069.\n\n              In the present case, the plaintiffs claim that the\n\nexposure of their children, at these young ages and in this\n\nsetting, to ways of life contrary to the parents' religious beliefs\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fviolates their ability to direct the religious upbringing of their\n\nchildren.   We try to identify the categories of harms alleged.   The\n\nparents do not allege coercion in the form of a direct interference\n\nwith their religious beliefs, nor of compulsion in the form of\n\npunishment for their beliefs, as in Yoder.   Nor do they allege the\n\ndenial of benefits.    Further, plaintiffs do not allege that the\n\nmere listening to a book being read violated any religious duty on\n\nthe part of the child.    There is no claim that as a condition of\n\nattendance at the public schools, the defendants have forced\n\nplaintiffs -- either the parents or the children -- to violate\n\ntheir religious beliefs.     In sum there is no claim of direct\n\ncoercion.\n\n            The heart of the plaintiffs' free exercise claim is a\n\nclaim of \"indoctrination\": that the state has put pressure on their\n\nchildren to endorse an affirmative view of gay marriage and has\n\nthus undercut the parents' efforts to inculcate their children with\n\ntheir own opposing religious views. The Supreme Court, we believe,\n\nhas never utilized an indoctrination test under the Free Exercise\n\nClause, much less in the public school context.   The closest it has\n\ncome is Barnette, a free speech case that implicated free exercise\n\ninterests and which Smith included in its hybrid case discussion.\n\nIn Barnette, the Court held that the state could not coerce\n\nacquiescence through compelled statements of belief, such as the\n\nmandatory recital of the pledge of allegiance in public schools.\n\n\n                                -38-\n\f319 U.S. at 634, 642.      It did not hold that the state could not\n\nattempt to inculcate values by instruction, and in fact carefully\n\ndistinguished the two approaches.             Id. at 631, 640; see also\n\nStewart, supra, at 74.           We do not address whether or not an\n\nindoctrination theory under the Free Exercise Clause is sound.\n\nPlaintiffs'   pleadings     do     not    establish      a    viable   case    of\n\nindoctrination, even assuming that extreme indoctrination can be a\n\nform of coercion.\n\n           First, as to the parents' free exercise rights, the mere\n\nfact that a child is exposed on occasion in public school to a\n\nconcept offensive to a parent's religious belief does not inhibit\n\nthe parent from instructing the child differently.              A parent whose\n\n\"child is exposed to sensitive topics or information [at school]\n\nremains free to discuss these matters and to place them in the\n\nfamily's   moral    or   religious       context,   or   to    supplement     the\n\ninformation with more appropriate materials.\"                C.N., 430 F.3d at\n\n185; see also Newdow, 542 U.S. at 16 (noting that the school's\n\nrequirement that Newdow's daughter recite the pledge of allegiance\n\nevery day did not \"impair[] Newdow's right to instruct his daughter\n\nin his religious views\").          The parents here did in fact have\n\nnotice, if not prior notice, of the books and of the school's\n\noverall intent to promote toleration of same-sex marriage, and they\n\nretained their ability to discuss the material and subject matter\n\n\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\fwith their children.      Our outcome does not turn, however, on\n\nwhether the parents had notice.\n\n            Turning to the children's free exercise rights, we cannot\n\nsee how Jacob's free exercise right was burdened at all: two books\n\nwere made available to him, but he was never required to read them\n\nor have them read to him.    Further, these books do not endorse gay\n\nmarriage or homosexuality, or even address these topics explicitly,\n\nbut merely describe how other children might come from families\n\nthat look different from one's own.      There is no free exercise\n\nright to be free from any reference in public elementary schools to\n\nthe existence of families in which the parents are of different\n\ngender combinations.\n\n            Joey has a more significant claim, both because he was\n\nrequired to sit through a classroom reading of King and King and\n\nbecause that book affirmatively endorses homosexuality and gay\n\nmarriage.   It is a fair inference that the reading of King and King\n\nwas precisely intended to influence the listening children toward\n\ntolerance of gay marriage.   That was the point of why that book was\n\nchosen and used.   Even assuming there is a continuum along which an\n\nintent to influence could become an attempt to indoctrinate,\n\nhowever, this case is firmly on the influence-toward-tolerance end.\n\nThere is no evidence of systemic indoctrination.        There is no\n\nallegation that Joey was asked to affirm gay marriage.     Requiring\n\n\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\fa student to read a particular book is generally not coercive of\n\nfree exercise rights.\n\n            Public schools are not obliged to shield individual\n\nstudents from ideas which potentially are religiously offensive,\n\nparticularly when the school imposes no requirement that the\n\nstudent agree with or affirm those ideas, or even participate in\n\ndiscussions about them.              See Fleischfresser, 15 F.3d at 690;\n\nMozert, 827 F.2d at 1063-65, 1070; see also Bauchman, 132 F.3d at\n\n558    (\"[P]ublic      schools   are    not     required    to   delete   from    the\n\ncurriculum       all     materials      that     may   offend     any     religious\n\nsensibility.\"       (quoting Florey v.

Barnette, 319 U.S. at 631\n\n(distinguishing between compelling students to declare a belief\n\nthrough mandatory recital of the pledge of allegiance, which\n\nviolates free exercise, and \"merely . . . acquaint[ing students]\n\nwith the flag salute so that they may be informed as to what it is\n\nor even what it means\").\n\n            On     the     facts,       there     is   no    viable       claim   of\n\n\"indoctrination\" here.

Nor were they subject to a constant stream of like\n\nmaterials.      There is no allegation here of a formalized curriculum\n\nrequiring students to read many books affirming gay marriage.                     Cf.\n\nMozert, 827 F.2d at 1079 (Boggs, J., concurring) (concluding that\n\nsuch facts could constitute a burden on free exercise, although\n\nsuch a burden would be constitutionally permissible in the public\n\nschool    context     if    parents    still     retained     other    educational\n\noptions).      The reading by a teacher of one book, or even three, and\n\neven if to a young and impressionable child, does not constitute\n\n\"indoctrination.\"\n\n             Because plaintiffs do not allege facts that give rise to\n\nclaims of constitutional magnitude, the district court did not err\n\nin granting defendants' motion to dismiss the claims under the U.S.\n\nConstitution.\n\n                                       III.\n\n             Public schools often walk a tightrope between the many\n\ncompeting      constitutional       demands     made    by   parents,      students,\n\nteachers, and the schools' other constituents.
