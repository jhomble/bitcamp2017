Mark Terison, Assistant U.S. Attorney,\n                                          \nwere on brief for appellee.\n\n                                           \n\n                                           \n\n     Per Curiam.  Appellant  Maldonado contends that his sentence\n               \n\non a  drug distribution charge  was tainted by  false information\n\npresented at his  sentencing hearing.   He claims  that both  the\n\nprosecutor and  defense counsel should have  brought the problems\n\nto the attention of the sentencing judge, and their failure to do\n\nso  constituted,  respectively,  a  denial  of  due  process  and\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.  We affirm.\n\n     This case arises  from a drug conspiracy that  extended from\n\nthe summer of  1990 through spring 1991,  involving Maldonado and\n\ntwo  other individuals,  both  of whom  testified at  Maldonado's\n\nsentencing hearing.   Their  testimony depicted Maldonado  as the\n\norganizer or supervisor of  the endeavor.   They said he was  the\n\nsource of all the cocaine they sold and, at least for part of the\n\nconspiracy period, he set the prices and controlled the proceeds.\n\nThe  two men also testified to the amounts of cocaine involved in\n\nthe  conspiracy, describing  both amounts  sold to  customers and\n\namounts delivered by or obtained through Maldonado. \n\n     The testimony on drug  amounts was not precisely consistent,\n\nand  at times was confusing.   The district  court was satisfied,\n\nhowever,  that  Maldonado  was  responsible  for  at  least  five\n\nkilograms, the  lowest amount necessary to  trigger offense level\n\n32  under the Sentencing Guidelines.  Based on the two witnesses'\n\ntestimony,  the  court  also   found  that  Maldonado  served  as\n\norganizer or supervisor of  the conspiracy.  The court  sentenced\n\nMaldonado to 121  months, the  shortest possible  term under  the\n\nrelevant guideline.\n\n     Maldonado identifies three factual  flaws in his sentencing:\n\n(1)  the  government  misrepresented   the  nature  of  its  plea\n\nagreement with the  primary witness,  co-conspirator Lemieux,  by\n\nstating that Lemieux's culpability was limited to the quantity of\n\ndrugs known  at the time of his indictment; (2) the court was not\n\napprised that, contrary to his statements at the hearing, Lemieux\n\nhad done extensive  drug dealing before  the conspiracy at  issue\n\nhere;  and (3)  the  court  also  did  not  know  that  Lemieux's\n\ntestimony at the hearing about the number of cocaine customers he\n\ncould identify by  name differed from  earlier statements he  had\n\ngiven to authorities.\n\n     Maldonado  asserts that  the lawyers'  failure to  alert the\n\ndistrict  court to  the true  circumstances may  have  caused the\n\ncourt to overvalue Lemieux's  testimony and, therefore, to impose\n\na higher sentence.  Additionally, he criticizes defense counsel's\n\nfailure to impeach Lemieux's credibility on the quantity of drugs\n\ndealt  during   the  conspiracy.    Maldonado   claims  that  the\n\nprosecutor's  omissions  denied  him  due process  and  that  the\n\ndefense   attorney's  deficiencies  deprived  him  of  meaningful\n\nrepresentation by  counsel.  Consequently, he  maintains that his\n\nsentence must be vacated.\n\n     This appeal is unavailing  for a number of reasons.   First,\n\nit  relies  in  substantial  part  on  documents  that  were  not\n\npresented  to the  district court.   Maldonado's  contention that\n\ninformation about  Lemieux's prior drug dealing  was omitted from\n\nthe sentencing hearing and that Lemieux testified  inconsistently\n\n                               -3-\n\nabout  his  knowledge  of  customer  names  is  based  on   prior\n\nstatements Lemieux  gave to authorities.   None of  these unsworn\n\nstatements  was made a  part of  the record  below.   Rather than\n\nasking this court to consider these interviews for the first time\n\non  appeal,  Maldonado  should  have brought  them  first  to the\n\nattention of  the trial court, see  Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc.\n                                                                 \n\nv. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 682 F.2d 12, 22 &amp;  n.8 (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1982),  presumably in  the form  of a  motion under  28 U.S.C.   \n\n2255.1\n\n     Were we to consider the interviews and rule on the merits of\n\nhis claims, Maldonado would fare no better.  The documents do not\n\nevince  perjury  by Lemieux  or undermine  in  any other  way the\n\ndistrict court's  findings on  the amount  of drugs involved  and\n\nMaldonado's  role.    The  testimony of  Lemieux  highlighted  by\n\nMaldonado  reasonably is understood not as a denial of prior drug\n\ndealing  but simply as confirmation of the date the conspiracy at\n\nissue began.  See  Transcript of Sentencing Hearing (Tr.)  at 9.2\n                 \n\nAs  for the  customer  names,  a  year's  lapse  in  time  and  a\n\n                    \n\n     1 We  recognize that  Maldonado's appeal  rests on  the fact\nthat these documents  were not presented  to the district  court.\nTo the extent the omission of the documents gives rise to a claim\nof  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel,  however, Maldonado  is\nobliged under  longstanding precedent to present  the claim first\nto the district court.  See infra at 5-7.  The due process claim,\n                                 \nrelying  as  it does  on the  alleged  deception of  the district\ncourt, strikes  us as similarly inappropriate  for initial review\nby this court.\n\n     2 In fact, although the point was not developed, Lemieux was\nasked by defense counsel whether he had been dealing drugs before\nhe became involved in  this conspiracy.  He answered  \"yes.\"  See\n                                                                 \nTr. at 27.\n\n                               -4-\n\ndifference  in  the  questions   asked  account  for  the  slight\n\nvariations in Lemieux's statements.3\n\n     Second, Maldonado's attempt  to create  controversy at  this\n\njuncture  over the  nature  of Lemieux's  plea agreement  plainly\n\nlacks substance.   Although the  government's characterization of\n\nthe agreement was muddled, the district court focused on the very\n\npoint  about  which Maldonado  is  concerned  -- the  discrepancy\n\nbetween the  amounts of  cocaine that Lemieux  attributed to  the\n\nconspiracy  in his testimony and the much smaller amount on which\n\nhe was sentenced.  See Tr.  at 85-88.  We are confident that  the\n                      \n\ncourt  understood  the  prosecutor  to say  only  that  Lemieux's\n\nsentence likely was  based on the amount of  cocaine known to the\n\ngovernment at the time he was sentenced.  In any event, the court\n\nhad the agreement before it and was in no way deceived.\n\n     Third, the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not\n\nproperly  before  us  as  we  ordinarily  do  not  consider  such\n\ncomplaints when raised for the first time on direct  appeal.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited  States v.  Georgacarakos,  No. 92-1890,  slip  op. at  18\n                                \n\n(March 30, 1993);  United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d  16, 19 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1991).   This is not the \"exotic exception\" to the rule, see\n                                                                 \n\nMcGill,  952  F.2d  at  19,  where  the  record  is  sufficiently\n      \n\ndeveloped to  allow reasoned  consideration of  the claim by  the\n\nappeals  court  in the  first instance.    Indeed, this  claim is\n\n                    \n\n     3 This case  does not involve allegations  of either delayed\ndisclosure   or  nondisclosure   of  Lemieux's   statements,  and\nMaldonado's reliance  on United States  v. Osorio, 929  F.2d 753,\n                                                 \n758  (1st Cir. 1991) and United States v. Perkins, 926 F.2d 1271,\n                                                 \n1275 (1st Cir. 1991), is therefore misplaced.\n\n                               -5-\n\nparticularly suited  to resolution by the  district court because\n\nits  gist  is  that  that  court  was  led  astray  by  counsel's\n\nperformance. \n\n     Once  again, even if review  were appropriate, we would find\n\nno constitutional error.  During cross-examination, trial counsel\n\nappropriately focused on Lemieux's testimony regarding the amount\n\nof cocaine and Maldonado's role in the conspiracy.  Maldonado, in\n\nfact, acknowledges  that the attorney reasonably  \"dealt with the\n\ncrucial  issue of quantity by accepting the veracity of that part\n\nof Lemieux's testimony . . .  most favorable to his client . .  .\n\n.\"   See Brief at 14  (\"These arguments were certainly  valid . .\n        \n\n..\").   But he goes on  to argue that a  more direct challenge to\n\nLemieux's testimony should  have been made based on the witness's\n\nprior  statements  to  authorities.   Those  statements, however,\n\narguably lend support to  the government's calculation of cocaine\n\namounts.4    The decision  not  to utilize  them  therefore would\n\n                    \n\n     4 Our computations  show that the  grand jury testimony  and\nreports filed by  two agents for the  Bureau of Intergovernmental\nDrug Enforcement supported substantially more than the minimum of\nfive kilograms of cocaine found by the district court.\n     Maldonado  relies in  particular on  Lemieux's statement  to\nAgent  Kelly that Maldonado delivered  1/2 to 1  pound of cocaine\nevery  two weeks for about 32  weeks.  See App. at  9.  Using the\n                                          \nsmaller estimate, Maldonado asserts that this produces only about\n3.6 kilograms, and  that this amount is far less  than the lowest\nquantity to which  Lemieux testified at the  hearing.  But in  so\narguing,  Maldonado is  reading  Kelly's memorandum  selectively.\nThe document also reports Lemieux's statement that  he made trips\nto  Providence and New York to pick up approximately 4 additional\nkilograms from Maldonado.  See App. at 9-10.\n                              \n     Maldonado  also  points  to Lemieux's  statements  to Agents\nKelly  and Small  concerning a  hiatus in  drug dealing  in early\n1991,  contending that  the Small  report describes  a four-month\nperiod from January through April while the Kelly report notes an\napproximately two-month break.   We do not read the  memoranda as\n\n                               -6-\n\nindicate sound strategy.   See Isabel v. United States,  980 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n60, 65 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (quoting Barrett v.  United States,  965\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 1184,  1193 &amp; n.18  (1st Cir. 1992))  (\"[W]e may not  find a\n\ndeficient  professional performance  in the  constitutional sense\n\nunless the challenged decisions were not `plausible options.'\").\n\n     The other  document upon which Maldonado's claims rest is an\n\nImmigration and Naturalization  Service investigative  memorandum\n\ndetailing Lemieux's prior  drug dealing activities.  At  the time\n\nof  sentencing,  the  district  court knew  that  Lemieux  was  a\n\nconvicted drug dealer testifying as part of a plea agreement with\n\nthe  government.  We fail  to see how  the peripheral information\n\nthat Lemieux also had dealt drugs independently in the past could\n\nhave affected materially the district court's fact-finding on the\n\namount  of  cocaine  and  Maldonado's role  in  the  conspiracy.5\n\nMaldonado  falls far  short  of demonstrating  that  \"there is  a\n\nreasonable  probability  that, but  for  counsel's unprofessional\n\nerrors,  the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984).\n                        \n\n     Finally,  we note that, at bottom, this appeal is a creative\n\nattempt  to challenge  as a  matter of  law the  district court's\n\nunassailable factual findings that Maldonado was the leader  of a\n\n                    \n\nnecessarily  inconsistent.   Small's  report  describes the  time\nframe as  \"between the months of January 1991 to the beginning of\nApril 1991,\" see App. at 4 -- which plainly excludes the month of\n                \nApril and  thus could be read to mean only the two months between\n                                                                 \nJanuary and April.\n\n     5 Moreover,  as previously noted, Lemieux  did admit earlier\ndealing.\n\n                               -7-\n\nconspiracy involving the distribution  of at least five kilograms\n\nof cocaine.  In  our view, Maldonado received fair  treatment and\n\nwas represented by competent  counsel.  Accordingly, his sentence\n\nis unchallengeable.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                               -8-\n",

The court  sentenced\n\nMaldonado to 121  months, the  shortest possible  term under  the\n\nrelevant guideline.\n\n     Maldonado identifies three factual  flaws in his sentencing:\n\n(1)  the  government  misrepresented   the  nature  of  its  plea\n\nagreement with the  primary witness,  co-conspirator Lemieux,  by\n\nstating that Lemieux's culpability was limited to the quantity of\n\ndrugs known  at the time of his indictment; (2) the court was not\n\napprised that, contrary to his statements at the hearing, Lemieux\n\nhad done extensive  drug dealing before  the conspiracy at  issue\n\nhere;  and (3)  the  court  also  did  not  know  that  Lemieux's\n\ntestimony at the hearing about the number of cocaine customers he\n\ncould identify by  name differed from  earlier statements he  had\n\ngiven to authorities.\n\n     Maldonado  asserts that  the lawyers'  failure to  alert the\n\ndistrict  court to  the true  circumstances may  have  caused the\n\ncourt to overvalue Lemieux's  testimony and, therefore, to impose\n\na higher sentence.  Additionally, he criticizes defense counsel's\n\nfailure to impeach Lemieux's credibility on the quantity of drugs\n\ndealt  during   the  conspiracy.    Maldonado   claims  that  the\n\nprosecutor's  omissions  denied  him  due process  and  that  the\n\ndefense   attorney's  deficiencies  deprived  him  of  meaningful\n\nrepresentation by  counsel.  Consequently, he  maintains that his\n\nsentence must be vacated.\n\n     This appeal is unavailing  for a number of reasons.   First,\n\nit  relies  in  substantial  part  on  documents  that  were  not\n\npresented  to the  district court.   Maldonado's  contention that\n\ninformation about  Lemieux's prior drug dealing  was omitted from\n\nthe sentencing hearing and that Lemieux testified  inconsistently\n\n                               -3-\n\nabout  his  knowledge  of  customer  names  is  based  on   prior\n\nstatements Lemieux  gave to authorities.   None of  these unsworn\n\nstatements  was made a  part of  the record  below.   Rather than\n\nasking this court to consider these interviews for the first time\n\non  appeal,  Maldonado  should  have brought  them  first  to the\n\nattention of  the trial court, see  Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc.\n                                                                 \n\nv.

The documents do not\n\nevince  perjury  by Lemieux  or undermine  in  any other  way the\n\ndistrict court's  findings on  the amount  of drugs involved  and\n\nMaldonado's  role.    The  testimony of  Lemieux  highlighted  by\n\nMaldonado  reasonably is understood not as a denial of prior drug\n\ndealing  but simply as confirmation of the date the conspiracy at\n\nissue began.  See  Transcript of Sentencing Hearing (Tr.)  at 9.2\n                 \n\nAs  for the  customer  names,  a  year's  lapse  in  time  and  a\n\n                    \n\n     1 We  recognize that  Maldonado's appeal  rests on  the fact\nthat these documents  were not presented  to the district  court.\nTo the extent the omission of the documents gives rise to a claim\nof  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel,  however, Maldonado  is\nobliged under  longstanding precedent to present  the claim first\nto the district court.  See infra at 5-7.  The due process claim,\n                                 \nrelying  as  it does  on the  alleged  deception of  the district\ncourt, strikes  us as similarly inappropriate  for initial review\nby this court.\n\n     2 In fact, although the point was not developed, Lemieux was\nasked by defense counsel whether he had been dealing drugs before\nhe became involved in  this conspiracy.  He answered  \"yes.\"  See\n                                                                 \nTr. at 27.\n\n                               -4-\n\ndifference  in  the  questions   asked  account  for  the  slight\n\nvariations in Lemieux's statements.3\n\n     Second, Maldonado's attempt  to create  controversy at  this\n\njuncture  over the  nature  of Lemieux's  plea agreement  plainly\n\nlacks substance.   Although the  government's characterization of\n\nthe agreement was muddled, the district court focused on the very\n\npoint  about  which Maldonado  is  concerned  -- the  discrepancy\n\nbetween the  amounts of  cocaine that Lemieux  attributed to  the\n\nconspiracy  in his testimony and the much smaller amount on which\n\nhe was sentenced.  See Tr.  at 85-88.  We are confident that  the\n                      \n\ncourt  understood  the  prosecutor  to say  only  that  Lemieux's\n\nsentence likely was  based on the amount of  cocaine known to the\n\ngovernment at the time he was sentenced.  In any event, the court\n\nhad the agreement before it and was in no way deceived.\n\n     Third, the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not\n\nproperly  before  us  as  we  ordinarily  do  not  consider  such\n\ncomplaints when raised for the first time on direct  appeal.

During cross-examination, trial counsel\n\nappropriately focused on Lemieux's testimony regarding the amount\n\nof cocaine and Maldonado's role in the conspiracy.  Maldonado, in\n\nfact, acknowledges  that the attorney reasonably  \"dealt with the\n\ncrucial  issue of quantity by accepting the veracity of that part\n\nof Lemieux's testimony . . .  most favorable to his client . .  .\n\n.\"   See Brief at 14  (\"These arguments were certainly  valid . .\n        \n\n..\").   But he goes on  to argue that a  more direct challenge to\n\nLemieux's testimony should  have been made based on the witness's\n\nprior  statements  to  authorities.   Those  statements, however,\n\narguably lend support to  the government's calculation of cocaine\n\namounts.4    The decision  not  to utilize  them  therefore would\n\n                    \n\n     4 Our computations  show that the  grand jury testimony  and\nreports filed by  two agents for the  Bureau of Intergovernmental\nDrug Enforcement supported substantially more than the minimum of\nfive kilograms of cocaine found by the district court.\n     Maldonado  relies in  particular on  Lemieux's statement  to\nAgent  Kelly that Maldonado delivered  1/2 to 1  pound of cocaine\nevery  two weeks for about 32  weeks.  See App. at  9.  Using the\n                                          \nsmaller estimate, Maldonado asserts that this produces only about\n3.6 kilograms, and  that this amount is far less  than the lowest\nquantity to which  Lemieux testified at the  hearing.  But in  so\narguing,  Maldonado is  reading  Kelly's memorandum  selectively.\nThe document also reports Lemieux's statement that  he made trips\nto  Providence and New York to pick up approximately 4 additional\nkilograms from Maldonado.  See App. at 9-10.\n                              \n     Maldonado  also  points  to Lemieux's  statements  to Agents\nKelly  and Small  concerning a  hiatus in  drug dealing  in early\n1991,  contending that  the Small  report describes  a four-month\nperiod from January through April while the Kelly report notes an\napproximately two-month break.   We do not read the  memoranda as\n\n                               -6-\n\nindicate sound strategy.   See Isabel v.

At  the time\n\nof  sentencing,  the  district  court knew  that  Lemieux  was  a\n\nconvicted drug dealer testifying as part of a plea agreement with\n\nthe  government.  We fail  to see how  the peripheral information\n\nthat Lemieux also had dealt drugs independently in the past could\n\nhave affected materially the district court's fact-finding on the\n\namount  of  cocaine  and  Maldonado's role  in  the  conspiracy.5\n\nMaldonado  falls far  short  of demonstrating  that  \"there is  a\n\nreasonable  probability  that, but  for  counsel's unprofessional\n\nerrors,  the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n\nStrickland v.
