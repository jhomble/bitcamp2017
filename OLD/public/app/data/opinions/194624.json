George  Chapdelaine  appeals\n                            \n\nfollowing his conviction for numerous offenses arising out of\n\nthe planned robbery  of a  Wells Fargo truck  by himself  and\n\nothers  at  the  Emerald  Square  Mall  in  North  Attleboro,\n\nMassachusetts.  The  plan was frustrated when  the truck left\n\nthe location  earlier than usual.   Chapdelaine was convicted\n\nafter trial while his accomplices pled.  We affirm.    \n\n                        I.  THE EVENTS\n\n     Acting on  an informant's tip, federal  agents and state\n\nand local police on  March 3, 1991, followed  Chapdelaine and\n\nAnthony Fiore  to  a meeting  with  Edward Mahan  and  George\n\nWhalen in  Walpole, Massachusetts.1   The next day,  March 4,\n\nChapdelaine,  Fiore, and  Mahan  drove Mahan's  vehicle to  a\n\nparking lot in Canton, Massachusetts.   When they left, Fiore\n\nwas driving  a Wagoneer jeep  later reported stolen  from the\n\nlot.   The  Wagoneer  was  taken  to  a  garage  in  Walpole,\n\noutfitted with a false registration plate, and then driven by\n\nFiore  (accompanied  by  Chapdelaine  in another  car)  to  a\n\nparking lot in North  Providence, Rhode Island, where  it was\n\nleft.   Fiore  later lodged  a stolen  Jaguar in  a different\n\nparking lot in Warwick, Rhode Island.\n\n     On March  25, Chapdelaine and Fiore  arrived in separate\n\nvehicles  at  the Emerald  Square  Mall  in North  Attleboro,\n\n                    \n\n     1Several  law enforcement  officers who  participated in\nsurveillance  of  the four  men  testified  at  trial to  the\ngroup's activities.\n\n                             -2-\n\nMassachusetts.   There, Fiore got into  Chapdelaine's car and\n\nthe two  drove around the mall  before leaving.   A few hours\n\nlater,  the two men returned to the mall in Fiore's Plymouth,\n\nthis  time accompanied by Mahan and Whalen.  The Plymouth was\n\nparked  near a BayBank branch  bank located in  the mall, and\n\nFiore and Mahan watched a Wells Fargo  truck as it arrived at\n\nthe bank and was loaded by a guard.  The following day, March\n\n26, Fiore returned alone to the mall, spent a short period of\n\ntime, and then left without having made any purchases.\n\n     The next day, March 27, Chapdelaine and Fiore drove to a\n\ndepartment store parking lot in Taunton, Massachusetts, where\n\nthey  remained in  their car  as the  same Wells  Fargo truck\n\nwhich served the  Emerald Mall BayBank  arrived to serve  the\n\ndepartment store.   When the  truck crossed the  street to  a\n\nnearby  bank, Chapdelaine and Fiore moved their car to a spot\n\ncloser  to the bank.  After the  truck left the bank, the two\n\nmen drove back to  the Emerald Mall parking lot  before going\n\nhome.  They returned the following day, March 28, to the  lot\n\nin  Taunton, where they again  waited in their  car until the\n\nWells Fargo truck arrived and departed.\n\n     The next  morning, March 29, Chapdelaine  and Fiore made\n\nanother brief visit  to the Emerald  Mall parking lot  before\n\nproceeding to a  parking lot in Cumberland,  Rhode Island, to\n\ndrop off the stolen Jaguar.   They then picked up  the stolen\n\nWagoneer,  now  in Fiore's  garage  and  bearing yet  another\n\n                             -3-\n\nregistration  plate,  and drove  it  to  the Cumberland  lot.\n\nLater  all  four  men met  at  the  Cumberland  lot.   There,\n\nChapdelaine  opened the  trunk  of his  car,  put on  gloves,\n\nhanded another pair of gloves to Whalen, and removed from the\n\ntrunk  a green  laundry  bag which  was  then placed  in  the\n\nWagoneer.   The  group  then drove  the  stolen vehicles  and\n\nFiore's Plymouth to the Emerald Mall parking lot.  As the men\n\nentered the mall lot  at 1:27 p.m., they  were passed by  the\n\nWells  Fargo truck on its way out; the truck's normal arrival\n\ntime at the  mall was 2  p.m. but this  was Good Friday,  and\n\nseveral of the truck's usual stops were closed.  The four men\n\npulled  into  a parking  garage,  remained  there for  a  few\n\nminutes,  and  then  drove  back  to  the  staging  area   in\n\nCumberland.\n\n     In Cumberland,  all four  were arrested.   The Wagoneer,\n\nwhich Chapdelaine was then driving, had to be turned off with\n\na screwdriver because the steering column was pulled back and\n\nthere was no key in the ignition.  A subsequent search of the\n\nvehicles  turned  up the  green laundry  bag (now  in Fiore's\n\nPlymouth) which  was found  to contain firearms  (including a\n\n.357 Magnum with an obliterated serial number), ammunition, a\n\nmake-up kit, a black wig and a washcloth.  Other items seized\n\nfrom   the  vehicles  included   gloves,  several  pieces  of\n\nclothing, a  make-up removal kit,  and a  police scanner  and\n\nradio  guidebook.     Later   that  day,   in  a  search   of\n\n                             -4-\n\nChapdelaine's home in Woonsocket, Rhode  Island, agents found\n\nfive .357-caliber  bullets in his bedroom  closet and $22,000\n\nin cash under his bed.\n\n     All four men were indicted.  Fiore and Mahan pled guilty\n\nprior to  trial.2   Whalen, tried together  with Chapdelaine,\n\nentered  a  guilty  plea  shortly  before  the  close of  the\n\ngovernment's case.   Chapdelaine was convicted  of conspiracy\n\nunder 18  U.S.C.   371 to rob a federally insured bank and to\n\ncommit  four  other,  related  offenses;  of  two  Hobbs  Act\n\nviolations,  18  U.S.C.     1951;  of  attempting  to  rob  a\n\nfederally insured  bank, 18  U.S.C.   2113(a);  of using  and\n\ncarrying firearms  during a  crime of  violence, 18  U.S.C.  \n\n924(c)(1);  of transporting  a stolen  vehicle in  interstate\n\ncommerce,  18 U.S.C.     2312; and  of four  firearms-related\n\noffenses, 18 U.S.C.   922.    After trial, the district court\n\nvacated the conviction  on one of the firearms counts because\n\nChapdelaine's name  had been inadvertently  omitted from that\n\ncount  in a  superseding indictment  used at  trial.   On all\n\ncounts  but one,  Chapdelaine  was  sentenced  to  concurrent\n\nsentences, the longest being  78 months' imprisonment; on the\n\nconviction for carrying a firearm during a crime of violence,\n\nthe court imposed  the five-year consecutive prison  sentence\n\nmade mandatory by 18 U.S.C.   924(c).  This appeal followed.\n\n                    \n\n     2Fiore's appeal  from his  sentence has  been previously\ndecided. United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                               \n\n                             -5-\n\n                             -6-\n\n                        II.  THE TRIAL\n\n     Publicity   and  Jury  Prejudice.     Chapdelaine  first\n                                     \n\ncontends  that  the  district  court  erred  in  denying  his\n\ninformal  motion  for  a  change  of  venue  on  grounds   of\n\nprejudicial pretrial publicity.   As evidence of  prejudicial\n\ncoverage, Chapdelaine  points to  articles in  the Providence\n                                                             \n\nJournal newspaper and to  local television coverage, which he\n       \n\nsays was  inflammatory.  Since Chapdelaine  does not describe\n\nthe content  of the television  reports, nor allege  that the\n\nreports were seen by any of the jurors, we have  no basis for\n\nevaluating his complaint about televised coverage.\n\n     As for the newspaper  articles, they are largely factual\n\naccounts of the arrests of the four men and subsequent guilty\n\npleas  of Fiore  and Mahan.3   On  the day  trial began,  the\n\ndistrict judge questioned each  of the jurors and alternates,\n\nwho  had  been  empaneled  two months  before,  to  determine\n\nwhether they had discussed the case, been  approached or read\n\nor heard anything  about it.  Only four of  the panel, two of\n\nwhom  ultimately  deliberated, answered  in  the affirmative;\n\neach had  been  exposed to  a  November 20,  1991  Providence\n                                                             \n\nJournal  article indicating  that two  of the  defendants had\n       \n\npleaded guilty before trial.   All four of the  panel members\n\n                    \n\n     3One  of  the  articles  mentions   Chapdelaine's  prior\nconviction  for cocaine trafficking  and an informant's claim\nthat  Chapdelaine and Fiore had earlier  tried to rob another\narmored  car.  There is no indication that any juror saw this\narticle or knew these supposed facts.\n\n                             -7-\n\naffirmed that  they could be impartial.   Neither Chapdelaine\n\nnor Whalen challenged any of the four for cause.\n\n     There  is no  basis  on this  record  for any  claim  of\n\n\"widespread, highly inflammatory  publicity.\"  United  States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Moreno  Morales, 815  F.2d  725,  734 (1st  Cir.),  cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 484 U.S. 966 (1987).  The only issue is whether juror\n      \n\nknowledge of guilty pleas  by co-defendants is information so\n\nsearing that failure to  excuse the juror for cause  is plain\n\nerror, even though  the trial  judge found the  jurors to  be\n\nimpartial.   The voir dire did not in this instance reflect a\n\n\"pattern  of deep and  bitter prejudice,\" Irwin  v. Dowd, 366\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 717,  726 (1961), compelling  the court to  override the\n\njuror's claim of impartiality.  We do not think juror bias is\n\ninherent  in  the knowledge  that  a  co-defendant has  pled.\n\nHines v. United States,  131 F.2d 971, 974 (10th  Cir. 1942).\n                      \n\nCf.  Murphy v. Florida, 421  U.S. 794 (1975) (juror knowledge\n                      \n\nof defendant's prior convictions).\n\n     There is  even less  basis  for Chapdelaine's  complaint\n\nthat  some  of  the  seated  jurors   had  relatives  in  law\n\nenforcement  or   were  familiar  with  some   of  the  trial\n\nparticipants or their families.   Chapdelaine was entitled to\n\nchallenge jurors for cause or to  argue on appeal that it was\n\nplain error not to excuse a juror.  But here no specifics are\n\noffered in his brief, so there is no error to assess.  As for\n\nthe claim that  trial counsel was  ineffective in failing  to\n\n                             -8-\n\nchallenge jurors, that issue  is not normally open  on direct\n\nappeal  and must  await a  collateral attack,  if Chapdelaine\n\nchooses to make one.   See United States v. Arango-Echeberry,\n                                                            \n\n927 F.2d 35, 39 ((1st Cir. 1991). \n\n     Whalen's Guilty Plea.   As the government was completing\n                         \n\nthe presentation of its case, Whalen pled guilty (outside the\n\npresence  of the  jury) and  withdrew from  the trial.   This\n\nprompted a  motion for  mistrial from Chapdelaine,  which the\n\ndistrict court denied.  Chapdelaine's position  then, renewed\n\nnow, was that the  jury would conclude from  Whalen's absence\n\nthat  he had pled guilty and would draw the further inference\n\nthat  Chapdelaine, as  an  alleged  co-conspirator,  must  be\n\nguilty as well.\n\n     We addressed this  issue in United States  v. Del Carmen\n                                                             \n\nRamirez, 823  F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1987).   The district court in\n       \n\nthat case, faced with the same situation, declined to declare\n\na mistrial but gave a cautionary instruction to the jury.  We\n\napproved   this  approach,  stating  that  the  court  should\n\n\"clearly  and carefully  instruct  the jury  to consider  the\n\nevidence  against  a  particular individual,  alone,  and  to\n\ndetermine guilt or  innocence on that basis.\"  Id.  at 3.  In\n                                                 \n\nthis case, the district court delivered an instruction almost\n\nidentical to the one we approved in Del Carmen Ramirez:\n                                                      \n\n             Members of the  Jury, you'll note that\n          Mr.  Whalen  is  no  longer   sitting  at\n          counsel table and he is no longer a party\n          to this  action.  You are  not, I repeat,\n\n                             -9-\n\n          you are not to speculate,  surmise in any\n          way whatsoever why he  is not here.  It's\n          none  of your concern;  it's not  part of\n          your  deliberations;  you  will not  even\n          discuss the matter as we go forward.  The\n          case stands here with Mr.  Chapdelaine as\n          the defendant.  Is anyone going to have a\n          problem with that?   If so, speak up now.\n          I can't stress to  you the importance  of\n          fairness, objectivity, total impartiality\n          and I  stress that again and  I stress to\n          you  why he is  not here is  none of your\n          concern; it  has nothing to do  with your\n          deliberations  in this  case  in any  way\n          whatsoever.\n\n      Chapdelaine  now says that  the instruction should have\n\nbeen repeated in the  closing charge to the jury.   At trial,\n\nhe made  no such request  and the  failure to do  so was  not\n\nplain error. \n\n     Sufficiency of  the Evidence.   Chapdelaine  next claims\n                                 \n\nthat  the  evidence  at   trial  was  insufficient  to  prove\n\nconspiracy,   attempted  robbery,   various  firearms-related\n\noffenses, and interstate transportation of a  stolen vehicle.\n\nIn   assessing  these   claims,  reasonable   inferences  and\n\ncredibility judgments  are taken in the  light most favorable\n\nto  the verdict;  and the  issue is  whether a  rational jury\n\ncould  have found  the defendant  guilty beyond  a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   United States  v. Batista-Polanco,  927 F.2d  14, 17\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1991). \n\n     Beginning with  conspiracy,  Chapdelaine says  that  the\n\nevidence did  not prove an intent to commit robbery.  This is\n\nnot a serious argument.  The evidence described at the outset\n\n                             -10-\n\nof this  opinion, a  sketch that omits  further incriminating\n\ndetail,   could  easily  persuade   a  reasonable  jury  that\n\nChapdelaine and his associates \"cased\" the BayBank branch and\n\nthe armored truck, positioned  stolen vehicles for an escape,\n\nacquired weapons and disguises, arrived at the scene ready to\n\ncommit the  crime and were  frustrated only by  an accidental\n\nchange in the truck's schedule.  United States v. Buffington,\n                                                            \n\n815  F.2d 1292 (9th Cir. 1987), where the Ninth Circuit found\n\nthe evidence inadequate, involved far less aggravated facts.\n\n     This  same  evidence supported  Chapdelaine's conviction\n\nfor attempted robbery.  To prove attempt, the government must\n\nestablish both  an intent  to commit the  substantive offense\n\nand  a \"substantial  step  towards its  commission,\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

(same  result under  similar facts), cert.  denied, 113\n                                                        \n\nS.Ct.  358 (1992).  That describes the activity in this case,\n\nand we have no reason to reach a different result.4\n\n     Turning  to  the firearms-related  offenses, Chapdelaine\n\nwas convicted of using  firearms during and in relation  to a\n\ncrime  of violence,  possession  of  firearms and  ammunition\n\nafter a felony conviction, and interstate transportation of a\n\nfirearm with  an obliterated serial  number.  In  addition to\n\nthe guns and ammunition recovered from the green laundry bag,\n\npolice   also   seized  five   rounds   of  ammunition   from\n\nChapdelaine's bedroom  closet.  The ammunition recovered from\n\nthe closet formed the basis of a separate count. \n\n     Chapdelaine's argument on appeal is two-fold.  First, he\n\nsays  that the  evidence  did not  show  that he  \"knowingly\"\n\npossessed the guns found in the laundry bag because there was\n\nno   proof  that  he  looked  inside  the  bag.    At  trial,\n\nChapdelaine  testified that  he thought  the bag  contained a\n\ntire  jack and car tools.  Noting  that the bag was recovered\n\nfrom Fiore's  Plymouth instead  of the  Wagoneer, Chapdelaine\n\n                    \n\n     4In a  related argument, Chapdelaine  contends that  the\njury  instruction  on  what   is  \"a  substantial  step\"  was\ninadequate.  The objection was not raised at trial and we are\nnot  told what was wrong with the instruction other than that\n\"a more complex  and detailed instruction was  required.\"  We\ntherefore consider the  claim waived.   See United States  v.\n                                                         \nZannino,  895 F.2d  1,  17 (1st  Cir.)  (issued raised  in  a\n       \nperfunctory manner are deemed waived), cert. denied, 494 U.S.\n                                                   \n1082 (1990).\n\n                             -12-\n\nargues  that the  evidence  did not  exclude the  possibility\n\nthat,  unbeknownst to him, guns were substituted for the jack\n\nand tools when the  bag was transferred from the  Wagoneer to\n\nthe Plymouth.   In this case,  involving a carefully  planned\n\narmed robbery with abundant weapons,  we think the jury could\n\nreasonably infer that the bag's contents when seized were the\n\nsame as when  Chapdelaine handled the  bag hours before,  and\n\nthat Chapdelaine knew that the  bag contained firearms.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Arango-Echeberry, 927 F.2d at 38.\n                                 \n\n     Second, Chapdelaine  argues that the  evidence failed to\n\nprove his \"possession\" of the firearms in the laundry bag and\n\nthe ammunition  found in  his bedroom closet.   Chapdelaine's\n\nhandling  of  the  laundry  bag  adequately  established  his\n\npossession of the  weapons within.5   As for  the bullets  in\n\nhis  closet, Chapdelaine  emphasizes that  the owners  of the\n\nhouse where he rented  a room were gun dealers  who testified\n\nto  storing ammunition  throughout  the home.   However,  the\n\nbullets retrieved  from Chapdelaine's closet were  in an area\n\nwithin  his \"dominion  and control.\"   Further,  they matched\n\nthose found  in the  .357 Magnum recovered  from the  laundry\n\nbag.   This was enough to prove that Chapdelaine was at least\n\n                    \n\n     5As for the question of the guns' use in relation to the\ncrime,  the  jury  could  readily  have  concluded  that,  by\ntransferring the guns to the  Wagoneer before setting off for\nthe mall with the others, Chapdelaine  \"intended to have [the\nweapons]  available for  possible use  during or  immediately\nfollowing\" a robbery.  United States v. Payero, 888 F.2d 928,\n                                              \n929 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n                             -13-\n\nin \"constructive possession\" of the ammunition in his closet.\n\nSee  United States v. Garcia, Nos. 92-1427, 92-1428, slip op.\n                            \n\nat 6-11 (1st Cir. Feb. 4,  1993); United States v. Wight, 968\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1393, 1397-98 (1st Cir. 1992).   \n\n     Chapdelaine's  last  attack  on  the  evidence  requires\n\nlittle  comment.   He  says that  a  rational jury  could not\n\nconvict him of knowingly transporting a stolen vehicle across\n\nstate lines because,  as he  testified at trial,  he did  not\n\nrealize the Wagoneer was stolen.  But of  course the jury was\n\nentitled to  disbelieve his testimony,  and Chapdelaine  does\n\nnot  otherwise contest  the government's  proof.   That proof\n\nincluded  (in  addition to  that  summarized  at the  outset)\n\nevidence that  Chapdelaine possessed  tools commonly  used by\n\ncar thieves  and Chapdelaine's own  admission that he  used a\n\nscrewdriver to start the Wagoneer.\n\n     The Flaw in the Indictment.  Chapdelaine's next claim of\n                               \n\nerror is the most serious:  he was mistakenly convicted of an\n\noffense for which he  was not indicted.   The count at  issue\n\ncharged interstate transportation of a stolen firearm, a Colt\n\n.45  caliber  pistol  seized  from  the  green  laundry  bag.\n\nChapdelaine  was in fact initially named in this count in the\n\noriginal indictment handed down by the grand jury.   Probably\n\nby accident, Chapdelaine's name was omitted from the count in\n\na superseding indictment. \n\n                             -14-\n\n     The omission escaped  the attention  of the  prosecutor,\n\nChapdelaine's defense  counsel, and  the trial judge,  all of\n\nwhom proceeded  as if Chapdelaine  were still charged  in the\n\ncount.   At trial,  Chapdelaine's counsel and  the government\n\nstipulated that the  Colt was stolen, and  there was evidence\n\nthat he  knowingly transported it  across state  lines.   The\n\ndistrict  court charged the jury  on the stolen firearm count\n\nand it was  included in  a redacted indictment  given to  the\n\njury to reflect only counts naming Chapdelaine.  In preparing\n\nthe pre-sentence report, the probation officer discovered the\n\nerror.  The district court then vacated the conviction on the\n\nstolen firearm charge but denied  a motion by Chapdelaine for\n\na new trial on all counts.\n\n     We are  not cited  to any precedent  directly addressing\n\nthis issue.6    The  important  fact conveyed  to  the  jury,\n\nChapdelaine's possession  of  the weapon,  was admissible  as\n\n\"intent\"  evidence on  several other  counts, whether  or not\n\npossession was  charged as an  offense.  The  stipulated fact\n\nthat  the gun was stolen may not  have been admissible on the\n\nother counts, but if  so the prejudicial force of  this point\n\nwas very  faint, as  other evidence showed  multiple weapons,\n\n                    \n\n     6The closest in point is Chow Bing Kew v. United States,\n                                                            \n248 F.2d 466 (9th  Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S.  889 (1957).\n                                      \nThe  Ninth Circuit there dismissed a conviction on a count in\nwhich  the  defendant was  not named  while leaving  intact a\nconviction on  another charge.   The question of  whether the\nformer conviction  invalidated the latter  was apparently not\nraised.\n\n                             -15-\n\ntwo  stolen  cars, an  obliterated  serial  number and  ample\n\nplanning.  The  jury was instructed to separate  the evidence\n\nas to each count, and its verdict--including the acquittal of\n\nChapdelaine  on two  counts relating  to the  stolen Jaguar--\n\nsuggests that it did just that.\n\n                        III.  SENTENCE\n\n     Chapdelaine's   final   challenge   is   to   sentencing\n\ncalculations.7   First, as to the  counts charging interstate\n\ntransportation   of  the  stolen   Wagoneer,  he  objects  to\n\nincluding the value of  the stolen Jaguar and to  a two-level\n\nenhancement in his  base offense level for more  than minimal\n\nplanning.   These computations were made  in the pre-sentence\n\nreport,  without objection  by Chapdelaine.   Whether  or not\n\nthese computations were error  (Chapdelaine was not convicted\n\nof the  counts relating to  the stolen Jaguar),  his sentence\n\nwas  not affected by these two calculations.  Pursuant to the\n\nguidelines,  the district  court  disregarded the  stolen car\n\ncounts  and set  Chapdelaine's  offense level  solely on  the\n\nbasis of the  grouped robbery counts.   U.S.S.G.    3D1.4(c).\n\nIt then sentenced Chapdelaine at the low end of the guideline\n\n                    \n\n     7Although the 1991 Sentencing Guidelines  were in effect\nat the  time of Chapdelaine's sentencing,  the district court\napplied  the 1990  guidelines in  effect at  the time  of the\noffenses, a result more  favorable to Chapdelaine. See United\n                                                             \nStates v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                    \nAll references in this opinion are to the 1990 guidelines.\n\n                             -16-\n\nrange  due to his age.   Adjustments to the stolen car counts\n\nsimply did not figure into Chapdelaine's sentence.\n\n     Next, Chapdelaine  complains of the  computation on  the\n\nrobbery  counts.  The guideline for robbery calls for a four-\n\nlevel   increase  for   losses  ranging   from   $800,000  to\n\n$1,500,000. U.S.S.G.   2B3.1(b)(6).  Where as here an attempt\n\nor conspiracy is at issue, \"intended\" loss is the test.8   At\n\nsentencing, over Chapdelaine's objection, the court imposed a\n\nfour-level increase in his base offense level for a \"loss\" of\n\n$1,000,000--the approximate amount of money contained in  the\n\nWells Fargo truck  when it stopped at the BayBank  on the day\n\nChapdelaine and the others were arrested.  \n\n     Chapdelaine  contends that  the  loss in  this case  was\n\nspeculative because no robbery actually occurred.  However,\n\n \"[i]n  an attempted theft, the  value of the  items that the\n\ndefendant attempted to steal  would be considered.\"  U.S.S.G.\n\n  2X1.1,  application  note 2.   The  requirement in  section\n\n2X1.1(a)   of  \"reasonable  certainty\"  \"goes  to  what  with\n\nreasonable   certainty  can   be   determined   to   be   the\n\n                    \n\n     8U.S.S.G.    2B3.1, application note 3, cross-references\nsection 2B1.1  for \"valuation  of loss\" in  robbery offenses.\nSection  2B1.1,  application  note  2, refers  the  judge  to\nsection  2X1.1  in cases  of  \"partially completed  conduct.\"\nSection 2X1.1 sets the  base offense level as that  fixed for\nthe  object  offense  (in  this  case,  robbery),  \"plus  any\nadjustments from  such  guideline for  any  intended  offense\nconduct that  can be established with  reasonable certainty.\"\nU.S.S.G   2X1.1(a).  \n\n                             -17-\n\nconspirator's intent.\"   United States v.  Medeiros, 897 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n13, 18 (1st Cir. 1990).   \n\n     Finally,  Chapdelaine  invokes  section 2X1.1(b),  which\n\ndirects the sentencing court to decrease by three levels  the\n\noffense  level  for  an  attempt  or  conspiracy  unless  the\n                                                        \n\ndefendant  or  conspirators  were  \"about  to  complete\"  the\n\nunderlying offense \"but for  the apprehension or interruption\n\nby   some   similar   event   beyond  [the   defendant's   or\n\nconspirators'] control.\"   U.S.S.G.    2X1.1(b)(1), (2).  The\n\ndistrict court in this  case declined to grant  the reduction\n\nbecause  it found  that  the robbery  was frustrated  \"simply\n\nbecause the  . . .  truck arrived  earlier than  usual.\"   On\n\nappeal, Chapdelaine disputes the  correctness of this finding\n\nwhile  the  government  naturally  urges  us  to  uphold  the\n\ndistrict court.  \n\n     We affirm  the district  court's conclusion that  on the\n\npresent facts Chapdelaine was  not entitled to the reduction.\n\nThe evidence  showed that Chapdelaine and  the others arrived\n\nat the mall prepared  and equipped to carry out a robbery and\n\nwere thwarted only  by the unexpected early departure  of the\n\nWells Fargo truck.   Under these circumstances,  there was no\n\nclear  error  in   the  district   court's  conclusion   that\n\nChapdelaine  was  \"about  to  complete\" a  robbery  \"but  for\n\napprehension  or interruption  by  some similar  event beyond\n\nthe  defendant's  control.\"   U.S.S.G.     2X1.1(b)(1).   See\n                                                             \n\n                             -18-\n\nUnited  States v.  Johnson,  962 F.2d  at 1313-14  (upholding\n                          \n\ndenial of the reduction under similar facts). \n\n     Chapdelaine  argues   that  the  reference   in  section\n\n2X1.1(b)  to  an   interruption  \"similar\"  to   apprehension\n\nexcludes  offenses that  are prevented  by  fortuitous events\n\nlike  the premature departure of  the Wells Fargo  truck.  In\n\nour  view,  the guideline  reflects  a  policy decision  that\n\nconspiracies and attempts should be  treated like substantive\n\noffenses  for sentencing purposes  if the substantive offense\n\nwas nearly  completed, and the defendant  did not voluntarily\n\nwithdraw.   The Sentencing  Commission  likely believed  that\n\nnear  accomplishment of  the criminal  object  normally poses\n\nenough risk  of actual harm, and  reveals enough culpability,\n\nas to justify the same punishment that would be imposed for a\n\ncompleted   offense.    It  is  nearness   of  the  crime  to\n\nachievement--not   the  precise  nature  of  the  involuntary\n\ninterruption--that  defeats  the   reduction  available   for\n\nconspiracies and attempts that  have not progressed very far.\n\nThis one progressed far enough.\n\n     The judgment of conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n                                                         \n\n                             -19-\n",

The  plan was frustrated when  the truck left\n\nthe location  earlier than usual.   Chapdelaine was convicted\n\nafter trial while his accomplices pled.  We affirm.    \n\n                        I.  THE EVENTS\n\n     Acting on  an informant's tip, federal  agents and state\n\nand local police on  March 3, 1991, followed  Chapdelaine and\n\nAnthony Fiore  to  a meeting  with  Edward Mahan  and  George\n\nWhalen in  Walpole, Massachusetts.1   The next day,  March 4,\n\nChapdelaine,  Fiore, and  Mahan  drove Mahan's  vehicle to  a\n\nparking lot in Canton, Massachusetts.   When they left, Fiore\n\nwas driving  a Wagoneer jeep  later reported stolen  from the\n\nlot.   The  Wagoneer  was  taken  to  a  garage  in  Walpole,\n\noutfitted with a false registration plate, and then driven by\n\nFiore  (accompanied  by  Chapdelaine  in another  car)  to  a\n\nparking lot in North  Providence, Rhode Island, where  it was\n\nleft.   Fiore  later lodged  a stolen  Jaguar in  a different\n\nparking lot in Warwick, Rhode Island.\n\n     On March  25, Chapdelaine and Fiore  arrived in separate\n\nvehicles  at  the Emerald  Square  Mall  in North  Attleboro,\n\n                    \n\n     1Several  law enforcement  officers who  participated in\nsurveillance  of  the four  men  testified  at  trial to  the\ngroup's activities.\n\n                             -2-\n\nMassachusetts.   There, Fiore got into  Chapdelaine's car and\n\nthe two  drove around the mall  before leaving.   A few hours\n\nlater,  the two men returned to the mall in Fiore's Plymouth,\n\nthis  time accompanied by Mahan and Whalen.  The Plymouth was\n\nparked  near a BayBank branch  bank located in  the mall, and\n\nFiore and Mahan watched a Wells Fargo  truck as it arrived at\n\nthe bank and was loaded by a guard.  The following day, March\n\n26, Fiore returned alone to the mall, spent a short period of\n\ntime, and then left without having made any purchases.\n\n     The next day, March 27, Chapdelaine and Fiore drove to a\n\ndepartment store parking lot in Taunton, Massachusetts, where\n\nthey  remained in  their car  as the  same Wells  Fargo truck\n\nwhich served the  Emerald Mall BayBank  arrived to serve  the\n\ndepartment store.   When the  truck crossed the  street to  a\n\nnearby  bank, Chapdelaine and Fiore moved their car to a spot\n\ncloser  to the bank.  After the  truck left the bank, the two\n\nmen drove back to  the Emerald Mall parking lot  before going\n\nhome.  They returned the following day, March 28, to the  lot\n\nin  Taunton, where they again  waited in their  car until the\n\nWells Fargo truck arrived and departed.\n\n     The next  morning, March 29, Chapdelaine  and Fiore made\n\nanother brief visit  to the Emerald  Mall parking lot  before\n\nproceeding to a  parking lot in Cumberland,  Rhode Island, to\n\ndrop off the stolen Jaguar.   They then picked up  the stolen\n\nWagoneer,  now  in Fiore's  garage  and  bearing yet  another\n\n                             -3-\n\nregistration  plate,  and drove  it  to  the Cumberland  lot.\n\nLater  all  four  men met  at  the  Cumberland  lot.   There,\n\nChapdelaine  opened the  trunk  of his  car,  put on  gloves,\n\nhanded another pair of gloves to Whalen, and removed from the\n\ntrunk  a green  laundry  bag which  was  then placed  in  the\n\nWagoneer.   The  group  then drove  the  stolen vehicles  and\n\nFiore's Plymouth to the Emerald Mall parking lot.  As the men\n\nentered the mall lot  at 1:27 p.m., they  were passed by  the\n\nWells  Fargo truck on its way out; the truck's normal arrival\n\ntime at the  mall was 2  p.m. but this  was Good Friday,  and\n\nseveral of the truck's usual stops were closed.  The four men\n\npulled  into  a parking  garage,  remained  there for  a  few\n\nminutes,  and  then  drove  back  to  the  staging  area   in\n\nCumberland.\n\n     In Cumberland,  all four  were arrested.   The Wagoneer,\n\nwhich Chapdelaine was then driving, had to be turned off with\n\na screwdriver because the steering column was pulled back and\n\nthere was no key in the ignition.  A subsequent search of the\n\nvehicles  turned  up the  green laundry  bag (now  in Fiore's\n\nPlymouth) which  was found  to contain firearms  (including a\n\n.357 Magnum with an obliterated serial number), ammunition, a\n\nmake-up kit, a black wig and a washcloth.  Other items seized\n\nfrom   the  vehicles  included   gloves,  several  pieces  of\n\nclothing, a  make-up removal kit,  and a  police scanner  and\n\nradio  guidebook.     Later   that  day,   in  a  search   of\n\n                             -4-\n\nChapdelaine's home in Woonsocket, Rhode  Island, agents found\n\nfive .357-caliber  bullets in his bedroom  closet and $22,000\n\nin cash under his bed.\n\n     All four men were indicted.  Fiore and Mahan pled guilty\n\nprior to  trial.2   Whalen, tried together  with Chapdelaine,\n\nentered  a  guilty  plea  shortly  before  the  close of  the\n\ngovernment's case.   Chapdelaine was convicted  of conspiracy\n\nunder 18  U.S.C.   371 to rob a federally insured bank and to\n\ncommit  four  other,  related  offenses;  of  two  Hobbs  Act\n\nviolations,  18  U.S.C.     1951;  of  attempting  to  rob  a\n\nfederally insured  bank, 18  U.S.C.   2113(a);  of using  and\n\ncarrying firearms  during a  crime of  violence, 18  U.S.C.  \n\n924(c)(1);  of transporting  a stolen  vehicle in  interstate\n\ncommerce,  18 U.S.C.     2312; and  of four  firearms-related\n\noffenses, 18 U.S.C.   922.    After trial, the district court\n\nvacated the conviction  on one of the firearms counts because\n\nChapdelaine's name  had been inadvertently  omitted from that\n\ncount  in a  superseding indictment  used at  trial.   On all\n\ncounts  but one,  Chapdelaine  was  sentenced  to  concurrent\n\nsentences, the longest being  78 months' imprisonment; on the\n\nconviction for carrying a firearm during a crime of violence,\n\nthe court imposed  the five-year consecutive prison  sentence\n\nmade mandatory by 18 U.S.C.   924(c).

Chapdelaine  first\n                                     \n\ncontends  that  the  district  court  erred  in  denying  his\n\ninformal  motion  for  a  change  of  venue  on  grounds   of\n\nprejudicial pretrial publicity.   As evidence of  prejudicial\n\ncoverage, Chapdelaine  points to  articles in  the Providence\n                                                             \n\nJournal newspaper and to  local television coverage, which he\n       \n\nsays was  inflammatory.  Since Chapdelaine  does not describe\n\nthe content  of the television  reports, nor allege  that the\n\nreports were seen by any of the jurors, we have  no basis for\n\nevaluating his complaint about televised coverage.\n\n     As for the newspaper  articles, they are largely factual\n\naccounts of the arrests of the four men and subsequent guilty\n\npleas  of Fiore  and Mahan.3   On  the day  trial began,  the\n\ndistrict judge questioned each  of the jurors and alternates,\n\nwho  had  been  empaneled  two months  before,  to  determine\n\nwhether they had discussed the case, been  approached or read\n\nor heard anything  about it.  Only four of  the panel, two of\n\nwhom  ultimately  deliberated, answered  in  the affirmative;\n\neach had  been  exposed to  a  November 20,  1991  Providence\n                                                             \n\nJournal  article indicating  that two  of the  defendants had\n       \n\npleaded guilty before trial.

As the government was completing\n                         \n\nthe presentation of its case, Whalen pled guilty (outside the\n\npresence  of the  jury) and  withdrew from  the trial.   This\n\nprompted a  motion for  mistrial from Chapdelaine,  which the\n\ndistrict court denied.  Chapdelaine's position  then, renewed\n\nnow, was that the  jury would conclude from  Whalen's absence\n\nthat  he had pled guilty and would draw the further inference\n\nthat  Chapdelaine, as  an  alleged  co-conspirator,  must  be\n\nguilty as well.\n\n     We addressed this  issue in United States  v. Del Carmen\n                                                             \n\nRamirez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490949\"><a href=\"/opinion/490949/united-states-v-julio-del-carmen-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1987).   The district court in\n       \n\nthat case, faced with the same situation, declined to declare\n\na mistrial but gave a cautionary instruction to the jury.  We\n\napproved   this  approach,  stating  that  the  court  should\n\n\"clearly  and carefully  instruct  the jury  to consider  the\n\nevidence  against  a  particular individual,  alone,  and  to\n\ndetermine guilt or  innocence on that basis.\"  Id.  at 3.  In\n                                                 \n\nthis case, the district court delivered an instruction almost\n\nidentical to the one we approved in Del Carmen Ramirez:\n                                                      \n\n             Members of the  Jury, you'll note that\n          Mr.  Whalen  is  no  longer   sitting  at\n          counsel table and he is no longer a party\n          to this  action.  You are  not, I repeat,\n\n                             -9-\n\n          you are not to speculate,  surmise in any\n          way whatsoever why he  is not here.  It's\n          none  of your concern;  it's not  part of\n          your  deliberations;  you  will not  even\n          discuss the matter as we go forward.  The\n          case stands here with Mr.  Chapdelaine as\n          the defendant.  Is anyone going to have a\n          problem with that?   If so, speak up now.\n          I can't stress to  you the importance  of\n          fairness, objectivity, total impartiality\n          and I  stress that again and  I stress to\n          you  why he is  not here is  none of your\n          concern; it  has nothing to do  with your\n          deliberations  in this  case  in any  way\n          whatsoever.\n\n      Chapdelaine  now says that  the instruction should have\n\nbeen repeated in the  closing charge to the jury.   At trial,\n\nhe made  no such request  and the  failure to do  so was  not\n\nplain error. \n\n     Sufficiency of  the Evidence.   Chapdelaine  next claims\n                                 \n\nthat  the  evidence  at   trial  was  insufficient  to  prove\n\nconspiracy,   attempted  robbery,   various  firearms-related\n\noffenses, and interstate transportation of a  stolen vehicle.\n\nIn   assessing  these   claims,  reasonable   inferences  and\n\ncredibility judgments  are taken in the  light most favorable\n\nto  the verdict;  and the  issue is  whether a  rational jury\n\ncould  have found  the defendant  guilty beyond  a reasonable\n\ndoubt.

That describes the activity in this case,\n\nand we have no reason to reach a different result.4\n\n     Turning  to  the firearms-related  offenses, Chapdelaine\n\nwas convicted of using  firearms during and in relation  to a\n\ncrime  of violence,  possession  of  firearms and  ammunition\n\nafter a felony conviction, and interstate transportation of a\n\nfirearm with  an obliterated serial  number.  In  addition to\n\nthe guns and ammunition recovered from the green laundry bag,\n\npolice   also   seized  five   rounds   of  ammunition   from\n\nChapdelaine's bedroom  closet.  The ammunition recovered from\n\nthe closet formed the basis of a separate count. \n\n     Chapdelaine's argument on appeal is two-fold.  First, he\n\nsays  that the  evidence  did not  show  that he  \"knowingly\"\n\npossessed the guns found in the laundry bag because there was\n\nno   proof  that  he  looked  inside  the  bag.    At  trial,\n\nChapdelaine  testified that  he thought  the bag  contained a\n\ntire  jack and car tools.  Noting  that the bag was recovered\n\nfrom Fiore's  Plymouth instead  of the  Wagoneer, Chapdelaine\n\n                    \n\n     4In a  related argument, Chapdelaine  contends that  the\njury  instruction  on  what   is  \"a  substantial  step\"  was\ninadequate.  The objection was not raised at trial and we are\nnot  told what was wrong with the instruction other than that\n\"a more complex  and detailed instruction was  required.\"  We\ntherefore consider the  claim waived.

In this case,  involving a carefully  planned\n\narmed robbery with abundant weapons,  we think the jury could\n\nreasonably infer that the bag's contents when seized were the\n\nsame as when  Chapdelaine handled the  bag hours before,  and\n\nthat Chapdelaine knew that the  bag contained firearms.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Arango-Echeberry, 927 F.2d at 38.\n                                 \n\n     Second, Chapdelaine  argues that the  evidence failed to\n\nprove his \"possession\" of the firearms in the laundry bag and\n\nthe ammunition  found in  his bedroom closet.   Chapdelaine's\n\nhandling  of  the  laundry  bag  adequately  established  his\n\npossession of the  weapons within.5   As for  the bullets  in\n\nhis  closet, Chapdelaine  emphasizes that  the owners  of the\n\nhouse where he rented  a room were gun dealers  who testified\n\nto  storing ammunition  throughout  the home.   However,  the\n\nbullets retrieved  from Chapdelaine's closet were  in an area\n\nwithin  his \"dominion  and control.\"   Further,  they matched\n\nthose found  in the  .357 Magnum recovered  from the  laundry\n\nbag.   This was enough to prove that Chapdelaine was at least\n\n                    \n\n     5As for the question of the guns' use in relation to the\ncrime,  the  jury  could  readily  have  concluded  that,  by\ntransferring the guns to the  Wagoneer before setting off for\nthe mall with the others, Chapdelaine  \"intended to have [the\nweapons]  available for  possible use  during or  immediately\nfollowing\" a robbery.

He  says that  a  rational jury  could not\n\nconvict him of knowingly transporting a stolen vehicle across\n\nstate lines because,  as he  testified at trial,  he did  not\n\nrealize the Wagoneer was stolen.  But of  course the jury was\n\nentitled to  disbelieve his testimony,  and Chapdelaine  does\n\nnot  otherwise contest  the government's  proof.   That proof\n\nincluded  (in  addition to  that  summarized  at the  outset)\n\nevidence that  Chapdelaine possessed  tools commonly  used by\n\ncar thieves  and Chapdelaine's own  admission that he  used a\n\nscrewdriver to start the Wagoneer.\n\n     The Flaw in the Indictment.  Chapdelaine's next claim of\n                               \n\nerror is the most serious:  he was mistakenly convicted of an\n\noffense for which he  was not indicted.   The count at  issue\n\ncharged interstate transportation of a stolen firearm, a Colt\n\n.45  caliber  pistol  seized  from  the  green  laundry  bag.\n\nChapdelaine  was in fact initially named in this count in the\n\noriginal indictment handed down by the grand jury.   Probably\n\nby accident, Chapdelaine's name was omitted from the count in\n\na superseding indictment. \n\n                             -14-\n\n     The omission escaped  the attention  of the  prosecutor,\n\nChapdelaine's defense  counsel, and  the trial judge,  all of\n\nwhom proceeded  as if Chapdelaine  were still charged  in the\n\ncount.   At trial,  Chapdelaine's counsel and  the government\n\nstipulated that the  Colt was stolen, and  there was evidence\n\nthat he  knowingly transported it  across state  lines.   The\n\ndistrict  court charged the jury  on the stolen firearm count\n\nand it was  included in  a redacted indictment  given to  the\n\njury to reflect only counts naming Chapdelaine.  In preparing\n\nthe pre-sentence report, the probation officer discovered the\n\nerror.  The district court then vacated the conviction on the\n\nstolen firearm charge but denied  a motion by Chapdelaine for\n\na new trial on all counts.\n\n     We are  not cited  to any precedent  directly addressing\n\nthis issue.6    The  important  fact conveyed  to  the  jury,\n\nChapdelaine's possession  of  the weapon,  was admissible  as\n\n\"intent\"  evidence on  several other  counts, whether  or not\n\npossession was  charged as an  offense.  The  stipulated fact\n\nthat  the gun was stolen may not  have been admissible on the\n\nother counts, but if  so the prejudicial force of  this point\n\nwas very  faint, as  other evidence showed  multiple weapons,\n\n                    \n\n     6The closest in point is Chow Bing Kew v. United States,\n                                                            \n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"243183\"><a href=\"/opinion/243183/chow-bing-kew-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th  Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">889</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1957).\n                                      \nThe  Ninth Circuit there dismissed a conviction on a count in\nwhich  the  defendant was  not named  while leaving  intact a\nconviction on  another charge.   The question of  whether the\nformer conviction  invalidated the latter  was apparently not\nraised.\n\n                             -15-\n\ntwo  stolen  cars, an  obliterated  serial  number and  ample\n\nplanning.  The  jury was instructed to separate  the evidence\n\nas to each count, and its verdict--including the acquittal of\n\nChapdelaine  on two  counts relating  to the  stolen Jaguar--\n\nsuggests that it did just that.\n\n                        III.  SENTENCE\n\n     Chapdelaine's   final   challenge   is   to   sentencing\n\ncalculations.7   First, as to the  counts charging interstate\n\ntransportation   of  the  stolen   Wagoneer,  he  objects  to\n\nincluding the value of  the stolen Jaguar and to  a two-level\n\nenhancement in his  base offense level for more  than minimal\n\nplanning.   These computations were made  in the pre-sentence\n\nreport,  without objection  by Chapdelaine.   Whether  or not\n\nthese computations were error  (Chapdelaine was not convicted\n\nof the  counts relating to  the stolen Jaguar),  his sentence\n\nwas  not affected by these two calculations.  Pursuant to the\n\nguidelines,  the district  court  disregarded the  stolen car\n\ncounts  and set  Chapdelaine's  offense level  solely on  the\n\nbasis of the  grouped robbery counts.   U.S.S.G.    3D1.4(c).\n\nIt then sentenced Chapdelaine at the low end of the guideline\n\n                    \n\n     7Although the 1991 Sentencing Guidelines  were in effect\nat the  time of Chapdelaine's sentencing,  the district court\napplied  the 1990  guidelines in  effect at  the time  of the\noffenses, a result more  favorable to Chapdelaine. See United\n                                                             \nStates v.

Adjustments to the stolen car counts\n\nsimply did not figure into Chapdelaine's sentence.\n\n     Next, Chapdelaine  complains of the  computation on  the\n\nrobbery  counts.  The guideline for robbery calls for a four-\n\nlevel   increase  for   losses  ranging   from   $800,000  to\n\n$1,500,000. U.S.S.G.   2B3.1(b)(6).  Where as here an attempt\n\nor conspiracy is at issue, \"intended\" loss is the test.8   At\n\nsentencing, over Chapdelaine's objection, the court imposed a\n\nfour-level increase in his base offense level for a \"loss\" of\n\n$1,000,000--the approximate amount of money contained in  the\n\nWells Fargo truck  when it stopped at the BayBank  on the day\n\nChapdelaine and the others were arrested.  \n\n     Chapdelaine  contends that  the  loss in  this case  was\n\nspeculative because no robbery actually occurred.  However,\n\n \"[i]n  an attempted theft, the  value of the  items that the\n\ndefendant attempted to steal  would be considered.\"  U.S.S.G.\n\n  2X1.1,  application  note 2.   The  requirement in  section\n\n2X1.1(a)   of  \"reasonable  certainty\"  \"goes  to  what  with\n\nreasonable   certainty  can   be   determined   to   be   the\n\n                    \n\n     8U.S.S.G.    2B3.1, application note 3, cross-references\nsection 2B1.1  for \"valuation  of loss\" in  robbery offenses.\nSection  2B1.1,  application  note  2, refers  the  judge  to\nsection  2X1.1  in cases  of  \"partially completed  conduct.\"\nSection 2X1.1 sets the  base offense level as that  fixed for\nthe  object  offense  (in  this  case,  robbery),  \"plus  any\nadjustments from  such  guideline for  any  intended  offense\nconduct that  can be established with  reasonable certainty.\"\nU.S.S.G   2X1.1(a).  \n\n                             -17-\n\nconspirator's intent.\"   United States v.

The\n\ndistrict court in this  case declined to grant  the reduction\n\nbecause  it found  that  the robbery  was frustrated  \"simply\n\nbecause the  . . .  truck arrived  earlier than  usual.\"   On\n\nappeal, Chapdelaine disputes the  correctness of this finding\n\nwhile  the  government  naturally  urges  us  to  uphold  the\n\ndistrict court.  \n\n     We affirm  the district  court's conclusion that  on the\n\npresent facts Chapdelaine was  not entitled to the reduction.\n\nThe evidence  showed that Chapdelaine and  the others arrived\n\nat the mall prepared  and equipped to carry out a robbery and\n\nwere thwarted only  by the unexpected early departure  of the\n\nWells Fargo truck.   Under these circumstances,  there was no\n\nclear  error  in   the  district   court's  conclusion   that\n\nChapdelaine  was  \"about  to  complete\" a  robbery  \"but  for\n\napprehension  or interruption  by  some similar  event beyond\n\nthe  defendant's  control.\"   U.S.S.G.     2X1.1(b)(1).   See\n                                                             \n\n                             -18-\n\nUnited  States v.  Johnson,  962 F.2d  at 1313-14  (upholding\n                          \n\ndenial of the reduction under similar facts). \n\n     Chapdelaine  argues   that  the  reference   in  section\n\n2X1.1(b)  to  an   interruption  \"similar\"  to   apprehension\n\nexcludes  offenses that  are prevented  by  fortuitous events\n\nlike  the premature departure of  the Wells Fargo  truck.  In\n\nour  view,  the guideline  reflects  a  policy decision  that\n\nconspiracies and attempts should be  treated like substantive\n\noffenses  for sentencing purposes  if the substantive offense\n\nwas nearly  completed, and the defendant  did not voluntarily\n\nwithdraw.   The Sentencing  Commission  likely believed  that\n\nnear  accomplishment of  the criminal  object  normally poses\n\nenough risk  of actual harm, and  reveals enough culpability,\n\nas to justify the same punishment that would be imposed for a\n\ncompleted   offense.    It  is  nearness   of  the  crime  to\n\nachievement--not   the  precise  nature  of  the  involuntary\n\ninterruption--that  defeats  the   reduction  available   for\n\nconspiracies and attempts that  have not progressed very far.\n\nThis one progressed far enough.\n\n     The judgment of conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n                                                         \n\n                             -19-\n</pre>",
