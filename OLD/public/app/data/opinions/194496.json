See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nMonahan v.  Dorchester Counseling  Ctr., Inc., 961  F.2d 987,\n                                             \n\n988  (1st Cir. 1992).  Plaintiff, an optometrist, worked part\n\ntime  for the  Department of  Health of  the Commonwealth  of\n\nPuerto Rico (\"DOH\") from March 5, 1951, to November 30, 1971.\n\nSometime   in   1984,   plaintiff   allegedly    received   a\n\n\"[C]ertificate of Service\"  (the \"Certificate\") verifying his\n\ntwenty-year term  of employment  with DOH.   Plaintiff claims\n\nthat the  Certificate operated as  an official acknowledgment\n\nthat, as of  1982, the  year in which  he turned  fifty-eight\n\nyears old, he became qualified to receive a pension.\n\n          Receiving  a  Certificate  is,  however,  only  the\n\nbeginning of the pension  application process in Puerto Rico.\n\nApparently,  DOH  pension applicants  with  Certificates next\n\nmust  acquire   from  DOH  a  \"Form   OP-15\"  verifying  that\n\napplicant's  employment has  terminated.   According  to  the\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\ncomplaint, the Retirement Office does  not process individual\n\npension applications without the Form OP-15.  \n\n          After   receiving    his   Certificate,   plaintiff\n\nattempted  to secure  a Form OP-15  from DOH.   To  that end,\n\nsometime  in  1984,  plaintiff  -- through  his  attorney  --\n\nrequested  DOH  to  issue  him  a  Form  OP-15.   Apparently,\n\nplaintiff's initial request went unheeded.  \n\n          The complaint does not reflect  further interaction\n\nbetween the  parties in 1984-1986.  The complaint does state,\n\nhowever, that on January  24, 1987, defendant Armando Troche,\n\nHead of  DOH's Personnel  Office,  communicated to  plaintiff\n\nthat  his  case  \"was  being   referred\"  to  the  DOH  Legal\n\nDepartment.  \n\n          Again, more  than two years passed  without further\n\ncommunication  between plaintiff and DOH.   Then, on June 14,\n\n1989, plaintiff reiterated his request that  defendant Troche\n\nissue  the  Form OP-15.   On  June 26,  1989, Troche  wrote a\n\nletter  to plaintiff  informing  him that  \"nothing could  be\n\ndone\"  as his case \"had been referred to the Legal Department\n\nsix months before.\" \n\n          Sometime in  1990, plaintiff requested for  a third\n\ntime  that  DOH issue  the  Form  OP-15.   Contemporaneously,\n\nplaintiff  also petitioned defendant  Dr. Jose  Soler Zapata,\n\nthe Secretary of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nissue the Form.  Apparently, defendant  Soler did not respond\n\nto plaintiff's request.\n\n          Sometime  thereafter,   plaintiff  began  extensive\n\nnegotiations over his employment status with officials in the\n\nDOH Legal Department.   After these negotiations, an official\n\nin  the  Legal  Department   went  to  defendant  Troche  and\n\nrecommended  that   he  fill  out  plaintiff's   Form  OP-15.\n\nDefendant  Troche  ignored  this  recommendation  and instead\n\nreferred   plaintiff's  case  to   the  \"Office   of  Central\n\nPersonnel.\" \n\n          After  learning  of  this  referral,  plaintiff, on\n\nFebruary  21, 1991,  filed \"an  appeal\" with  defendant Soler\n\nagain  seeking  his Form  OP-15.    Defendant Soler  referred\n\nplaintiff's case to defendant  Ricardo Torres Munoz, the Head\n\nof the DOH Legal Department.  Defendant Munoz  conferred with\n\ndefendant Troche and, in May of  1991, wrote a letter to  the\n\nRetirement Office  certifying that plaintiff  had worked with\n\nDOH for  twenty years.   Without  the  requisite Form  OP-15,\n\nhowever, the  Retirement Office would not process plaintiff's\n\napplication.\n\n          During  the  month  of June  1991,  plaintiff  made\n\nnumerous phone  calls and  personal visits to  DOH requesting\n\nthe Form OP-15.  The  DOH again ignored plaintiff's requests.\n\nIn  a letter dated July  8, 1991, plaintiff  made yet another\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nrequest for the Form OP-15.  Again, the DOH turned a deaf ear\n\nto plaintiff's request.\n\n          On  August 2,  1991,  plaintiff filed  the  instant\n\nlawsuit  alleging  that defendants'  refusal  to provide  the\n\nRetirement  Office with  his Form  OP-15 was,  inter alia,  a\n                                                         \n\nviolation  of   rights  secured  him  under   the  Fourteenth\n\nAmendment's  Due  Process   and  Equal  Protection   Clauses.\n\nPlaintiff  sued under 42  U.S.C.   1983  seeking both damages\n\nand  injunctive  relief.   In  response,  defendants filed  a\n\nmotion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint arguing, inter  alia,\n                                                            \n\nthat  the complaint  was  barred by  the applicable  one-year\n\nstatute of  limitations.   Finding that plaintiff's  cause of\n\naction accrued more than a year before plaintiff filed  suit,\n\nthe district court  agreed and dismissed the  complaint.  For\n\nthe reasons  outlined below,  we affirm the  district court's\n\nruling.  \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          The  parties do  not dispute  the  applicability of\n\nPuerto Rico's one-year statute  of limitations governing tort\n\nactions.  See Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349,\n                                              \n\n353 (1st Cir. 1992); Torres v. Superintendent of Police,  893\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 404, 406 (1st Cir. 1990).  While state  law supplies the\n\nstatute of  limitations  in  a    1983  action,  federal  law\n\ngoverns the accrual period.   See, e.g., Rivera-Muriente, 959\n                                                        \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nF.2d  at 353.  Under federal  law, a plaintiff's   1983 cause\n\nof action accrues when s/he \"knows, or has reason to know, of\n\nthe injury on which the action is based.\"  Id.  \n                                              \n\n          In  determining when  plaintiff  became  aware  (or\n\nshould have been aware) of his alleged injury, our first task\n\nis to identify the injury of which he complains.  Plaintiff's\n\nultimate complaint is that  defendants' actions are depriving\n\nhim  of  his  pension.   However,  as  is  apparent from  the\n\ncomplaint, defendants  have  not officially  denied  him  the\n                                           \n\npension.  Rather, they allegedly are shuttling his Form OP-15\n\nrequest from department to department within the DOH, thereby\n\npreventing  him  from  making   formal  application  to   the\n\nRetirement  Office.    Therefore,   it  appears  that  it  is\n\ndefendants'  repeated  failure  to  respond   to  plaintiff's\n                              \n\nrequest that DOH  fill out a  Form OP-15 that  serves as  the\n\nbasis for plaintiff's claim.  \n\n          Thus,  for  statute  of  limitations  purposes, the\n\npivotal question  becomes when plaintiff knew  or should have\n\nknown that defendants were  not going to respond to  his Form\n\nOP-15 request.  The  district court determined that plaintiff\n\nbecame  aware of his injury in 1984, the year he received the\n\nCertificate  indicating that  he was  qualified to  receive a\n\npension.  The court based this determination, in part, on the\n\nfact  that plaintiff knew as early as 1972 that DOH's failure\n\nto \"define his  status\" would deprive him of pension benefits\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nonce he became eligible.  The  court therefore reasoned that,\n\nin 1984,  when plaintiff's initial request  went unheeded, he\n\nwas (or should  have been)  on notice that  his civil  rights\n\nwere being  violated.  We disagree with  the district court's\n\nreasoning.\n\n          In  1984,  plaintiff  was  on notice  that  he  was\n\nqualified to make an application to the Retirement Office for\n\na pension.  As a  result, he made his initial request  to DOH\n\nto issue  him the  Form OP-15.   DOH did  not respond  to his\n\nrequest.  Plaintiff may well have known at that point that if\n\nDOH ultimately failed to  \"define his status,\" the Retirement\n\nOffice would not be able  to process his pension application.\n\nIt is hardly  clear, however, that,  in 1984, plaintiff  knew\n\n(or should have known) that defendants would never officially\n\nrespond to plaintiff's Form OP-15 request.\n\n          Plaintiff's initial request, however, went unheeded\n\nfor more than  two years.   In January  1987, when  defendant\n\nTroche finally responded  to plaintiff's initial  request, he\n\ninformed him that his  case \"was being referred to  the Legal\n\nDepartment[.]\"  Reading the complaint favorably to plaintiff,\n\nwe  think it would not have been unreasonable for him to have\n\nconcluded -- at this point -- that, although extremely  slow,\n\nthe  bureaucratic process might  eventually produce  his Form\n\nOP-15.  \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          Another two years  passed, however, as  plaintiff's\n\nrequest  apparently languished in the Legal Department.  As a\n\nresult,  we   think  that  when   defendant  Troche  informed\n\nplaintiff on June 26,  1989, that \"nothing could be  done\" as\n\nhis case again had been \"referred to the Legal Department[,]\"\n\nplaintiff should have been on notice that defendants  did not\n\nintend to act on his Form OP-15 request.  Thus,  any cause of\n\naction  plaintiff  had  against  defendants accrued  at  that\n\npoint.  \n\n          Accordingly, we  hold that,  on June 26,  1989, the\n\none-year statute of limitations began to run on plaintiff's  \n\n1983  action.1  As plaintiff waited more than two years after\n\nthat  date to  file  his complaint,  his    1983  action  was\n\nuntimely.2    Thus,  while  we  disagree  with  the  district\n\ncourt's selection of an accrual date, we affirm its dismissal\n\nof plaintiff's complaint. \n\n           Affirmed.\n                    \n\n                    \n\n1.   Plaintiff  also pursues  an alternative theory  that his\nlawsuit  was in  reality  only against  defendants Soler  and\nMunoz, whose unlawful actions, he contends, occurred within a\nyear of his filing of the  complaint.  For the reasons  amply\narticulated  by  the  district  court,  see Lafont-Rivera  v.\n                                                         \nSoler-Zapata, No.  91-1932CCC, slip op. at  5-6 (D.P.R. April\n            \n29, 1992), we find this argument meritless.\n\n2.    Plaintiff attempts to establish timeliness by asserting\nthat  defendants  have  committed a  \"continuing  violation.\"\nPlaintiff, however, failed to  articulate this theory  below.\nAs  such he cannot  raise it  for the  first time  on appeal.\nSee, e.g., Clement v. United States, No. 91-1839, slip op. at\n                                   \n20 (1st Cir. November 25, 1992).    \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n",

Plaintiff, an optometrist, worked part\n\ntime  for the  Department of  Health of  the Commonwealth  of\n\nPuerto Rico (\"DOH\") from March 5, 1951, to November 30, 1971.\n\nSometime   in   1984,   plaintiff   allegedly    received   a\n\n\"[C]ertificate of Service\"  (the \"Certificate\") verifying his\n\ntwenty-year term  of employment  with DOH.   Plaintiff claims\n\nthat the  Certificate operated as  an official acknowledgment\n\nthat, as of  1982, the  year in which  he turned  fifty-eight\n\nyears old, he became qualified to receive a pension.\n\n          Receiving  a  Certificate  is,  however,  only  the\n\nbeginning of the pension  application process in Puerto Rico.\n\nApparently,  DOH  pension applicants  with  Certificates next\n\nmust  acquire   from  DOH  a  \"Form   OP-15\"  verifying  that\n\napplicant's  employment has  terminated.   According  to  the\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\ncomplaint, the Retirement Office does  not process individual\n\npension applications without the Form OP-15.  \n\n          After   receiving    his   Certificate,   plaintiff\n\nattempted  to secure  a Form OP-15  from DOH.   To  that end,\n\nsometime  in  1984,  plaintiff  -- through  his  attorney  --\n\nrequested  DOH  to  issue  him  a  Form  OP-15.   Apparently,\n\nplaintiff's initial request went unheeded.  \n\n          The complaint does not reflect  further interaction\n\nbetween the  parties in 1984-1986.  The complaint does state,\n\nhowever, that on January  24, 1987, defendant Armando Troche,\n\nHead of  DOH's Personnel  Office,  communicated to  plaintiff\n\nthat  his  case  \"was  being   referred\"  to  the  DOH  Legal\n\nDepartment.  \n\n          Again, more  than two years passed  without further\n\ncommunication  between plaintiff and DOH.   Then, on June 14,\n\n1989, plaintiff reiterated his request that  defendant Troche\n\nissue  the  Form OP-15.   On  June 26,  1989, Troche  wrote a\n\nletter  to plaintiff  informing  him that  \"nothing could  be\n\ndone\"  as his case \"had been referred to the Legal Department\n\nsix months before.\" \n\n          Sometime in  1990, plaintiff requested for  a third\n\ntime  that  DOH issue  the  Form  OP-15.   Contemporaneously,\n\nplaintiff  also petitioned defendant  Dr. Jose  Soler Zapata,\n\nthe Secretary of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nissue the Form.  Apparently, defendant  Soler did not respond\n\nto plaintiff's request.\n\n          Sometime  thereafter,   plaintiff  began  extensive\n\nnegotiations over his employment status with officials in the\n\nDOH Legal Department.   After these negotiations, an official\n\nin  the  Legal  Department   went  to  defendant  Troche  and\n\nrecommended  that   he  fill  out  plaintiff's   Form  OP-15.\n\nDefendant  Troche  ignored  this  recommendation  and instead\n\nreferred   plaintiff's  case  to   the  \"Office   of  Central\n\nPersonnel.\" \n\n          After  learning  of  this  referral,  plaintiff, on\n\nFebruary  21, 1991,  filed \"an  appeal\" with  defendant Soler\n\nagain  seeking  his Form  OP-15.    Defendant Soler  referred\n\nplaintiff's case to defendant  Ricardo Torres Munoz, the Head\n\nof the DOH Legal Department.  Defendant Munoz  conferred with\n\ndefendant Troche and, in May of  1991, wrote a letter to  the\n\nRetirement Office  certifying that plaintiff  had worked with\n\nDOH for  twenty years.   Without  the  requisite Form  OP-15,\n\nhowever, the  Retirement Office would not process plaintiff's\n\napplication.\n\n          During  the  month  of June  1991,  plaintiff  made\n\nnumerous phone  calls and  personal visits to  DOH requesting\n\nthe Form OP-15.  The  DOH again ignored plaintiff's requests.\n\nIn  a letter dated July  8, 1991, plaintiff  made yet another\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nrequest for the Form OP-15.  Again, the DOH turned a deaf ear\n\nto plaintiff's request.\n\n          On  August 2,  1991,  plaintiff filed  the  instant\n\nlawsuit  alleging  that defendants'  refusal  to provide  the\n\nRetirement  Office with  his Form  OP-15 was,  inter alia,  a\n                                                         \n\nviolation  of   rights  secured  him  under   the  Fourteenth\n\nAmendment's  Due  Process   and  Equal  Protection   Clauses.\n\nPlaintiff  sued under 42  U.S.C.   1983  seeking both damages\n\nand  injunctive  relief.   In  response,  defendants filed  a\n\nmotion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint arguing, inter  alia,\n                                                            \n\nthat  the complaint  was  barred by  the applicable  one-year\n\nstatute of  limitations.   Finding that plaintiff's  cause of\n\naction accrued more than a year before plaintiff filed  suit,\n\nthe district court  agreed and dismissed the  complaint.  For\n\nthe reasons  outlined below,  we affirm the  district court's\n\nruling.  \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          The  parties do  not dispute  the  applicability of\n\nPuerto Rico's one-year statute  of limitations governing tort\n\nactions.

While state  law supplies the\n\nstatute of  limitations  in  a    1983  action,  federal  law\n\ngoverns the accrual period.   See, e.g., Rivera-Muriente, 959\n                                                        \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nF.2d  at 353.  Under federal  law, a plaintiff's   1983 cause\n\nof action accrues when s/he \"knows, or has reason to know, of\n\nthe injury on which the action is based.\"  Id.  \n                                              \n\n          In  determining when  plaintiff  became  aware  (or\n\nshould have been aware) of his alleged injury, our first task\n\nis to identify the injury of which he complains.  Plaintiff's\n\nultimate complaint is that  defendants' actions are depriving\n\nhim  of  his  pension.   However,  as  is  apparent from  the\n\ncomplaint, defendants  have  not officially  denied  him  the\n                                           \n\npension.  Rather, they allegedly are shuttling his Form OP-15\n\nrequest from department to department within the DOH, thereby\n\npreventing  him  from  making   formal  application  to   the\n\nRetirement  Office.    Therefore,   it  appears  that  it  is\n\ndefendants'  repeated  failure  to  respond   to  plaintiff's\n                              \n\nrequest that DOH  fill out a  Form OP-15 that  serves as  the\n\nbasis for plaintiff's claim.  \n\n          Thus,  for  statute  of  limitations  purposes, the\n\npivotal question  becomes when plaintiff knew  or should have\n\nknown that defendants were  not going to respond to  his Form\n\nOP-15 request.  The  district court determined that plaintiff\n\nbecame  aware of his injury in 1984, the year he received the\n\nCertificate  indicating that  he was  qualified to  receive a\n\npension.  The court based this determination, in part, on the\n\nfact  that plaintiff knew as early as 1972 that DOH's failure\n\nto \"define his  status\" would deprive him of pension benefits\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nonce he became eligible.  The  court therefore reasoned that,\n\nin 1984,  when plaintiff's initial request  went unheeded, he\n\nwas (or should  have been)  on notice that  his civil  rights\n\nwere being  violated.  We disagree with  the district court's\n\nreasoning.\n\n          In  1984,  plaintiff  was  on notice  that  he  was\n\nqualified to make an application to the Retirement Office for\n\na pension.  As a  result, he made his initial request  to DOH\n\nto issue  him the  Form OP-15.   DOH did  not respond  to his\n\nrequest.  Plaintiff may well have known at that point that if\n\nDOH ultimately failed to  \"define his status,\" the Retirement\n\nOffice would not be able  to process his pension application.\n\nIt is hardly  clear, however, that,  in 1984, plaintiff  knew\n\n(or should have known) that defendants would never officially\n\nrespond to plaintiff's Form OP-15 request.\n\n          Plaintiff's initial request, however, went unheeded\n\nfor more than  two years.   In January  1987, when  defendant\n\nTroche finally responded  to plaintiff's initial  request, he\n\ninformed him that his  case \"was being referred to  the Legal\n\nDepartment[.]\"  Reading the complaint favorably to plaintiff,\n\nwe  think it would not have been unreasonable for him to have\n\nconcluded -- at this point -- that, although extremely  slow,\n\nthe  bureaucratic process might  eventually produce  his Form\n\nOP-15.  \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          Another two years  passed, however, as  plaintiff's\n\nrequest  apparently languished in the Legal Department.  As a\n\nresult,  we   think  that  when   defendant  Troche  informed\n\nplaintiff on June 26,  1989, that \"nothing could be  done\" as\n\nhis case again had been \"referred to the Legal Department[,]\"\n\nplaintiff should have been on notice that defendants  did not\n\nintend to act on his Form OP-15 request.  Thus,  any cause of\n\naction  plaintiff  had  against  defendants accrued  at  that\n\npoint.  \n\n          Accordingly, we  hold that,  on June 26,  1989, the\n\none-year statute of limitations began to run on plaintiff's  \n\n1983  action.1  As plaintiff waited more than two years after\n\nthat  date to  file  his complaint,  his    1983  action  was\n\nuntimely.2    Thus,  while  we  disagree  with  the  district\n\ncourt's selection of an accrual date, we affirm its dismissal\n\nof plaintiff's complaint. \n\n           Affirmed.\n                    \n\n                    \n\n1.   Plaintiff  also pursues  an alternative theory  that his\nlawsuit  was in  reality  only against  defendants Soler  and\nMunoz, whose unlawful actions, he contends, occurred within a\nyear of his filing of the  complaint.  For the reasons  amply\narticulated  by  the  district  court,  see Lafont-Rivera  v.\n                                                         \nSoler-Zapata, No.  91-1932CCC, slip op. at  5-6 (D.P.R. April\n            \n29, 1992), we find this argument meritless.\n\n2.    Plaintiff attempts to establish timeliness by asserting\nthat  defendants  have  committed a  \"continuing  violation.\"\nPlaintiff, however, failed to  articulate this theory  below.\nAs  such he cannot  raise it  for the  first time  on appeal.\nSee, e.g., Clement v. United States, No. 91-1839, slip op. at\n                                   \n20 (1st Cir. November 25, 1992).    \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n</pre>",
