This case involves constitutional\n\nchallenges to a Maine statute enacted to reduce health care costs\n\nand protect prescribers' data privacy.                        In Maine and elsewhere,\n\neach    time    a    prescription        from     a    physician      or    other    licensed\n\nprescriber is given to a pharmacy, the pharmacy obtains a number of\n\nfacts    that       identify     the    prescriber.           Data    put   together    from\n\nmultiple transactions involving the same prescriber reveal certain\n\npatterns and preferences, including her prescribing history, her\n\nchoice    of     particular           brand-name      drugs    versus       their    generic\n\nequivalents, and the likelihood she will adopt new brand-name\n\ndrugs.\n\n               Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of 22 Me. Rev.\n\nStat.    Ann.       tit.   22,    §    1711-E(2-A),       which       allows      prescribers\n\nlicensed       in    Maine     to      choose    not     to    make    this       identifying\n\ninformation available for use in marketing prescription drugs to\n\nthem. Section 1711-E(2-A) does not directly prohibit any marketing\n\npractices.       Rather, it prohibits certain entities from licensing,\n\nusing, selling, transferring, or exchanging this information for a\n\nmarketing purpose if the prescriber has opted to protect the\n\nconfidentiality of her prescribing data.                      Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n22, § 1711-E(2-A).\n\n               Plaintiffs,       companies        that    collect       vast      amounts   of\n\nidentifying data about individual prescribers and aggregate the\n\ndata     into       reports      and     databases       for     use       when     marketing\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fpharmaceutical products, are covered in the text of the law, as are\n\nothers.     See id. § 1711-E(1)(A)(I).                Immediately after section\n\n1711-E(2-A)'s      enactment     in    2008,   and     before      its    enforcement,\n\nplaintiffs sued Maine's attorney general in the federal district\n\ncourt of Maine under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that section 1711-\n\nE(2-A)'s restrictions on the licensing, use, sale, transfer, or\n\nexchange of Maine prescribers' identifying data for a marketing\n\npurpose are unconstitutional limitations on protected speech under\n\nthe First Amendment; that these restrictions are unconstitutionally\n\nvague and overbroad under the First and Fourteenth Amendments; and\n\nthat the law also regulates transactions outside of Maine in\n\nviolation of the dormant Commerce Clause.                   On December 21, 2007,\n\nthe district court granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction and\n\nprohibited Maine from enforcing section 1711-E(2-A) on the basis of\n\nplaintiffs' First Amendment claims.             See IMS Health Corp. v. Rowe,\n\n532 F. Supp. 2d 153, 183 (D. Me. 2007).1\n\n            This case comes to us in an unusual posture.                     Maine is\n\nnot   the   only    state   to    have    restricted         plaintiffs'      use    of\n\nprescriber-identifying         data,    and    this    is    not    the    first    time\n\nplaintiffs have made these constitutional claims.                   On November 18,\n\n2008, after the district court granted plaintiffs a preliminary\n\ninjunction in this case, this court upheld a similar, but not\n\n\n      1\n          The district court also enjoined Maine from enforcing\nparts of section 1711-E implementing section 1171-E(2-A).   See\nRowe, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 183.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fidentical, New Hampshire statute against plaintiffs' constitutional\n\nchallenges, a ruling that binds this panel.              See IMS Health Inc. v.\n\nAyotte, 550 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2864\n\n(2009).       In the meantime, the district court's injunction has\n\nremained   in    effect     during   this    appeal,     and    Maine   has   never\n\nimplemented section 1711-E(2-A).\n\n              We reject all of plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to\n\nsection 1711-E(2-A).        Plaintiffs' First Amendment challenges fail\n\nfor the reasons stated in Ayotte: the statute regulates conduct,\n\nnot speech, and even if it regulates commercial speech, that\n\nregulation satisfies constitutional standards.                 They also fail for\n\nreasons not present in Ayotte.         The Maine statute constitutionally\n\nprotects Maine prescribers' choice to opt in to confidentiality\n\nprotection to avoid being subjected to unwanted solicitations based\n\non their identifying data.           We also reject the argument that the\n\nstatute is void for vagueness.\n\n              Plaintiffs'    argument       that   section       1711-E(2-A)    is\n\nunconstitutional under the dormant Commerce Clause if applied to\n\nplaintiffs' out-of-state use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers'\n\nidentifying data also fails.         We interpret the Maine statute using\n\nMaine's principles of statutory construction and hold that section\n\n1711-E(2-A) regulates prescription drug information intermediaries'\n\nout-of-state use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' data.                   We\n\nhold   that    this   interpretation        does   not   raise    constitutional\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fconcerns under the dormant Commerce Clause, which might necessitate\n\na   narrower           reading    of   the   statute   under     the   doctrine    of\n\nconstitutional avoidance.\n\n                 The    Supreme    Court's   current   dormant    Commerce     Clause\n\njurisprudence does not leave Maine powerless to protect Maine\n\nprescribers who have sought to prevent the use of their identifying\n\ndata in transactions that also cause substantial in-state harms,\n\nincluding          increased       health     care     costs.          The     statute\n\nconstitutionally reaches plaintiffs' out-of-state transactions as\n\na necessary incident of Maine's strong interest in protecting\n\nopted-in Maine prescribers from unwanted solicitations, a policy\n\nthat Maine also rationally believes will lower its health care\n\ncosts.          Nor, we hold, would section 1711-E(2-A)'s regulation of\n\nprescription drug information intermediaries' out-of-state use or\n\nsale       of    opted-in    Maine     prescribers'    identifying      data    raise\n\nconstitutional concerns as a disproportionate burden on interstate\n\ncommerce under Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 (1970).\n\n                                  I. Factual Background\n\n                 The relevant facts are undisputed.2\n\n                 Prescriber-identifying data is used for many purposes,\n\nbut this case concerns restrictions on only one of those uses:\n\n\n\n       2\n          These facts rely in part on this court's discussion of\nthe same industry, and plaintiffs' role in that industry, in our\n2008 Ayotte opinion.   The parties have relied heavily on those\nfacts and the record from Ayotte.\n\n                                             -5-\n\fpharmaceutical      manufacturers'         use    of    the      data   to    send    their\n\npharmaceutical        sales        representatives          to    personally         market\n\nparticular drugs to particular prescribers, a practice known as\n\n\"detailing.\"     Section 1711-E defines \"detailing\" as \"one-to-one\n\ncontact with a prescriber or employees or agents of a prescriber\n\nfor the purpose of increasing or reinforcing the prescribing of a\n\ncertain drug by the prescriber.\"                 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22,\n\n§ 1711-E(1)(A-2).\n\n            Detailing is a massive and expensive undertaking for\n\npharmaceutical manufacturers, which spend billions of dollars a\n\nyear to have some 90,000 pharmaceutical sales representatives make\n\nweekly or monthly one-on-one visits to prescribers nationwide.\n\nStephanie     Saul,       Doctors    Object      as    Drug      Makers      Learn   Who's\n\nPrescribing     What,       N.Y.    Times,    May      4,    2006,      at    A1.     Each\n\npharmaceutical        manufacturer's          detailers           market        particular\n\npharmaceutical products in particular regions. A single prescriber\n\nis visited by an average of twenty-eight detailers a week; an\n\naverage of fourteen detailers a week call on a single specialist.\n\n            Prescriber-identifying data is a valuable tool in a\n\ndetailer's arsenal of sales techniques.                     With it, pharmaceutical\n\nmanufacturers can pinpoint the prescribing habits of individual\n\nprescribers    in     a    region    and   target      prescribers        who    might   be\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fpersuaded to switch brands or prescribe more of a detailer's brand\n\nof products.3   See Saul, supra, at A1.\n\n           During their one-on-one visits to prescribers, detailers\n\ndistribute upwards of $1 million worth of free product samples per\n\nyear, along with branded promotional materials and pamphlets about\n\nthe different conditions their particular products can be used to\n\ntreat.     Detailers use prescriber-identifying data to do these\n\nthings more effectively; every sales pitch can be tailored to what\n\nthe detailer knows of the prescriber based on her prescribing\n\nhistory.    The central objective is to get prescribers to adopt the\n\npharmaceutical product the detailer is marketing and to build brand\n\nloyalty.   This goal is not only explicit; it is how detailers earn\n\nbonuses.   See Saul, supra, at A1.\n\n           Some prescribers, in Maine and elsewhere, welcome these\n\ninteractions.    Detailers, they say, provide them with studies\n\nrelevant to their practices, useful free samples, and targeted data\n\nabout how widely certain new drugs have been prescribed by others.\n\nThey find that detailers provide helpful comparisons of competing\n\ndrugs used to treat the same conditions and information about new\n\n\n     3\n          When Merck marketed Vioxx, for example, it used a wealth\nof prescriber-identifying data to create monthly reports on\nindividual prescribers in each detailer's assigned territory. The\nreports showed how many Merck versus non-Merck drugs the prescriber\nprescribed and estimated how many of these prescriptions could be\nsubstituted for Merck products. Merck then tracked its detailers'\nprogress in converting prescribers in their territories to the\nMerck brand and gave detailers bonuses based on Merck's sales\nvolume and market share in the detailer's territory.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdrugs or more effective alternatives to the prescriptions they\n\ncurrently prescribe.    These prescribers say they are immune to\n\ndetailers' influence and see no conflict of interest.\n\n           Significantly, though, other prescribers have strenuously\n\nobjected that detailing intrudes into their prescribing decisions.\n\nDetailers, these prescribers insist, should not be able to use\n\ntheir prescribing histories to target them for unwelcome marketing\n\ncalls.    An article by a senior vice president of the American\n\nMedical Association (AMA) and an executive of plaintiff IMS Health\n\nnoted that physicians \"complain bitterly\" about detailers \"who wave\n\ndata in their faces\" and challenge them with their own prescribing\n\nhistories when they fail to prescribe more of the product the\n\ndetailer has been advertising.    R. A. Musacchio & R. J. Hunkler,\n\nMore Than a Game of Keep-Away, Pharmaceutical Executive, May 2006.\n\nThe head of California's state medical association has reported\n\nthat prescribers have been \"outraged that people came into their\n\noffice and talked to them about how many times they prescribed a\n\nparticular drug.\"    Saul, supra, at A1.    Aggregated survey data\n\nconfirms that physicians have a predominantly negative view of\n\ndetailing.   See P. Manchanda & E. Honka, The Effects and Role of\n\nDirect-to-Physician Marketing in the Pharmaceutical Industry: An\n\nIntegrative Review, 5 Yale J. Health Pol'y L. & Ethics 785, 788-91\n\n(2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           Many Maine prescribers have openly objected to detailing.\n\nA survey by the Maine Medical Association in 2006 revealed that a\n\nmajority     of   Maine   physicians         did   not     want    pharmaceutical\n\nmanufacturers to be able to use their individual prescribing\n\nhistories for marketing purposes.            One Maine prescriber explained\n\nthat she felt that \"it intrudes upon my privacy and my work life\n\nfor drug companies to buy my information, without my permission,\n\nfor marketing purposes.\"         She has \"ask[ed] to be removed from\n\nmailing lists and telephone call lists\" and \"would like to have the\n\nsimilar option of not allowing my professional information to be\n\nsold to drug companies for marketing purposes.\"\n\n           Detailers' use of prescriber-identifying data, however,\n\nis only the final step in a series of transactions that begin with\n\nthe acquisition and aggregation of massive amounts of individual\n\nprescribers' identifying data.          Pharmaceutical manufacturers lack\n\ndirect access to prescriber-identifying data. That fact has fueled\n\nan   enormously    profitable,       multilayered     market       for   acquiring,\n\naggregating,      packaging,   and    selling      these    data    primarily   for\n\ndetailing.    Plaintiffs are the middlemen of this market.\n\n           When     filling    prescriptions,            individual      pharmacies\n\naccumulate data about the prescriptions individual prescribers have\n\nmade, usually for insurance reimbursement.                  Pharmacies that are\n\npart of national chains normally transfer these data to the chain's\n\ncentral data warehouse.        Each pharmacy, and even each pharmacy\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fchain,    is    only   one   piece   of    a   bigger      picture;     individual\n\nprescribers, or their patients, may make prescriptions at many\n\ndifferent pharmacy locations.\n\n            This is where plaintiffs come in.              Plaintiff companies\n\nare    prescription     drug    information     intermediaries          that     mine\n\nspecialized data.       They contract with numerous pharmacies and, to\n\na lesser degree, insurance companies and other carriers, to buy\n\ntheir raw data.        Under those contracts, the pharmacy's computer\n\nsoftware collects data it sends to plaintiffs.                     The software\n\nencrypts       patient-identifying    data     so   that     plaintiffs        cannot\n\nidentify individual patients by name, but it captures information\n\ndirectly identifying prescribers by name and address and shows\n\ndetails about the particular drugs prescribed.\n\n            Plaintiffs receive and aggregate data from these various\n\nsources and then compile reports and databases.                 They assemble a\n\ncomplete picture of individual prescribers' prescribing histories\n\nby    cross-referencing      prescriber    names    with     publicly    available\n\ndatabases,      including    the   AMA's   database     of    medical     doctors'\n\nspecialties.      See Saul, supra, at A1.       Plaintiffs admit that most\n\nof their reports and databases are destined--and designed--for\n\npharmaceutical manufacturers to instruct detailers where to focus\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\ftheir efforts, identify which prescribers to target, and assess\n\ndetailers' effectiveness.4\n\n           Plaintiffs    then    license    or   sell   these   specialized\n\ndatabases and reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers, a lucrative\n\nbusiness that yielded revenues of $1.75 billion for plaintiff IMS\n\nHealth alone in 2005.5    Id.    Plaintiffs' products are the building\n\nblocks of the reports pharmaceutical manufacturers generate for\n\nindividual detailers, who use them to target prescribers in their\n\nassigned areas.\n\n                             II. The Maine Law\n\n           To date, Maine appears to be one of only three states\n\nthat have limited detailers' access to prescribers' identifying\n\ndata.    See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1711-E(2-A); N.H. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. § 318:47-f; Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, § 4631(d).          Like its\n\ncounterparts in New Hampshire and Vermont, the Maine law, section\n\n1711-E(2-A), does so indirectly: in relevant part, it states that\n\n\"a   carrier,     pharmacy      or    prescription      drug    information\n\nintermediary,\" as defined in the statute, \"may not license, use,\n\nsell, transfer or exchange for value, for any marketing purpose,\n\n\n\n     4\n          Plaintiffs also sell or license other databases and\nreports to other clients, including governments, nonprofit\norganizations, and research institutions.\n     5\n          Pharmaceutical manufacturers may also use plaintiffs'\ndata for other purposes, like to send out alerts about particular\ndrugs to prescribers who have been prescribing it or for research\nand development.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fprescription drug information that identifies a prescriber who has\n\nfiled for confidentiality protection.\"6   Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n22, § 1711-E(2-A).   Maine's law regulates the different layers of\n\nthe market for prescriber-identifying information, but it does not\n\nprohibit detailing, nor does it purport to prohibit speech by\n\ndetailers to prescribers.\n\n          Unlike similar laws in New Hampshire and Vermont, the\n\ncentral feature of the Maine law is to limit detailers' access to\n\nan individual prescriber's identifying data only if the prescriber\n\nhas affirmatively opted for this protection.7   See id.\n\n\n     6\n          \"Marketing\"    includes   \"[a]dvertising,    publicizing,\npromoting or selling a prescription drug;\" \"activities undertaken\nfor the purpose of influencing the market share of a prescription\ndrug or the prescribing patterns of a prescriber, a detailing visit\nor a personal appearance;\" \"[a]ctivities undertaken to evaluate or\nimprove the effectiveness of a professional detailing sales force;\"\nor \"[a] brochure, media advertisement or announcement, poster or\nfree sample of a prescription drug.\" Id. § 1711-E(1)(F-1).\n     \"'Marketing' does not include pharmacy reimbursement,\nformulary compliance, pharmacy file transfers in response to a\npatient request or as a result of the sale or purchase of a\npharmacy, patient care management, utilization review by a health\ncare provider or agent of a health care provider or the patient's\nhealth plan or an agent of the patient's health plan, and health\ncare research.\" Id.\n     7\n          This circuit upheld New Hampshire's statute, which\ncategorically prohibits certain entities, including plaintiffs,\nfrom licensing, transferring, using, or selling any prescriber-\nidentifying data for a commercial purpose. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§ 318:47-f; Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 47. The Vermont statute instead\nprohibits certain entities from selling, licensing, exchanging, or\npermitting the use of records containing prescriber-identifying\ndata when marketing or promoting prescription drugs unless the\nprescriber has affirmatively consented to such uses. See Vt. Stat.\nAnn. tit. 18, § 4631(d); IMS Health Inc. v. Sorrell, 631 F. Supp.\n2d 434, 443-44 (D.

The\n\nlaw does not, by its terms, affect this transaction.\n\n            Section 1711-E(2-A) does regulate transactions between\n\nthose pharmacies (or pharmacy data centers) and prescription drug\n\ninformation intermediaries like plaintiffs.                Section 1711-E(2-A)\n\nprohibits   pharmacies        from   selling,   transferring,          or   licensing\n\nopted-in    Maine   prescribers'       identifying     data      for   a    marketing\n\npurpose, unless the prescriber revokes the protection.

See id. § 1711-E(2-A).            Section 1711-E(2-A) also\n\nprohibits plaintiffs from selling or licensing (to pharmaceutical\n\nmanufacturers) only the portion of these databases and reports\n\ncontaining opted-in Maine prescribers' identifying data.

Section    1711-E(2-A)      does   not\n\nexplicitly limit detailers' use of prescriber-identifying data, but\n\nthe   earlier   stages   of    regulation    are    meant   to    prevent    this\n\ninformation from getting to detailers for use in marketing.\n\n             A violation of section 1711-E(2-A)'s prohibitions is a\n\nviolation of the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, id. § 1711-E(3),\n\nand, under that act, the Maine Attorney General can enjoin the\n\npractice and levy civil penalties of $10,000 per violation, Me.\n\nRev.

See Rowe, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 157.           As of September\n\n2009, notwithstanding the injunction, 259 Maine prescribers have\n\nopted in for confidentiality protection.\n\n                               III. First Amendment\n\n              We reject plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge to the\n\nMaine law.         Plaintiffs' claims fail for the same reasons we\n\nrejected their nearly identical First Amendment challenge to New\n\nHampshire's similar statute in Ayotte.           Plaintiffs' arguments here\n\nfail for another, independent reason.            Maine has set up an opt-in\n\nscheme for prescribers licensed in Maine.               Even assuming arguendo\n\nthat the Maine law restricts protected commercial speech and not\n\nconduct, we hold that it directly advances the substantial purpose\n\nof protecting opted-in prescribers from having their identifying\n\ndata used in unwanted solicitations by detailers, and thus Maine's\n\ninterests in lowering health care costs.\n\n                                        A.\n\n              In   Ayotte,     this   circuit   held    that    New   Hampshire's\n\nrestrictions on plaintiffs' licensing, use, sale, transfer or\n\nexchange   of      all   New   Hampshire     prescribers'      identifying   data\n\nregulate conduct, not speech, and thus the First Amendment does not\n\nprotect       plaintiffs'        conduct.         550      F.3d       at   51-54.\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fAyotte   alternately    held    that    even    if    the   New    Hampshire      law\n\nregulates speech, plaintiffs are at best engaged in commercial\n\nspeech and the law survives intermediate scrutiny under Central\n\nHudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, 447 U.S.\n\n557 (1980).    Id. at 54-60.     Ayotte also held that reducing health\n\ncare costs is a substantial government interest; the court did not\n\nreach New Hampshire's two other asserted interests, protecting\n\ncitizens' health and protecting the confidentiality of patients'\n\nand prescribers' identifying data.             Id. at 55.     The New Hampshire\n\nlaw directly advances health care cost reduction given record\n\nevidence showing that detailing increases prescription drug costs,\n\nthat   detailers'    effectiveness      is    bound   up    with   their    use    of\n\nindividual prescribers' histories, and that reducing detailers'\n\naccess to prescribers' data would make prescribers less responsive\n\nto detailers' efforts to market costly brand-name drugs.                    Id. at\n\n55-58.   Finally, Ayotte found that New Hampshire's law is no more\n\nrestrictive than necessary to advance the state's interest in\n\ncontaining    costs,   though   its     prohibitions        extend   to    all    New\n\nHampshire prescribers' identifying data.              Id. at 58-60.\n\n           Maine's     law,    which     was     modeled     in    part    on     New\n\nHampshire's, regulates the same kind of conduct for the same three\n\npurposes: reducing health care costs in Maine, protecting Maine\n\npatients' health, and protecting Maine patients' and prescribers'\n\nidentifying data from unwanted uses in Maine.               Me. Stat. Rev. Ann.\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\ftit. 22, § 1711-E(A-1).    Indeed, section 1711-E(2-A) differs from\n\nthe New Hampshire law only in ways that weaken plaintiffs' First\n\nAmendment and other challenges.       Unlike New Hampshire's law, the\n\nMaine law only prohibits plaintiffs from licensing, using, selling,\n\ntransferring or exchanging data identifying prescribers licensed in\n\nMaine who have opted-in for confidentiality protection.         See id.\n\n§ 1711-E(2-A).      Unlike New Hampshire's legislature, the Maine\n\nlegislature included specific findings that limiting detailers' use\n\nof Maine prescribers' identifying data would reduce health care\n\ncosts, ensure Maine prescribers' decisions were based on unbiased\n\nmedical and scientific evidence, and protect Maine prescribers from\n\nunwanted detailing visits.    Compare id. § 1711-E (1-A), with N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. § 318:47-f.     Maine also introduced evidence into\n\nthe record to show how section 1711-E advances Maine's three\n\nasserted interests.\n\n           Plaintiffs concede that Ayotte forecloses their First\n\nAmendment challenge and that the district court's injunction, which\n\nwas granted based on their First Amendment claims before Ayotte was\n\ndecided,   cannot   be   affirmed    on    those   grounds.   Plaintiffs\n\nnonetheless reiterate shorthand versions of the same arguments this\n\ncourt rejected in Ayotte: that their use, sale, and licensing of\n\nprescriber-identifying information is speech, not conduct, and that\n\nit is protected speech warranting strict scrutiny, not merely\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fcommercial speech.13      Their alternate claim, that the Maine law\n\ncannot survive intermediate scrutiny as commercial         speech because\n\nMaine has not introduced any evidence that the law will actually\n\nreduce health care costs, is contradicted by Ayotte's reasoning,\n\nand the record in this case supports Ayotte's conclusion.           See 550\n\nF.3d at 55-58.    There is no basis for considering these arguments\n\nanew.\n\n           We reject plaintiffs' contention that United States v.\n\nStevens, 130 S. Ct. 1577 (2010), undermines Ayotte's holding.\n\nStevens held that speech in the form of video depictions of animal\n\nfighting is not categorically unprotected by the First Amendment,\n\nsee id. 1585-87.    By contrast, Ayotte's initial holding was that\n\nthe New Hampshire law primarily regulated conduct, not speech. 550\n\nF.3d at 51-54.   Ayotte did suggest that any speech regulated was of\n\nsuch minimal value that it likely fell outside of First Amendment\n\nprotections.     Id. at 51-52.       That suggestion, though, was in\n\nservice   of   Ayotte's   holding    that   the   New   Hampshire   statute\n\nregulated conduct, not speech, an argument not at issue in Stevens.\n\n\n\n     13\n          Plaintiffs' overbreadth argument, not addressed by the\ndistrict court, consists of the bare assertion that the Maine law\nis overbroad because it prohibits the use of prescriber-identifying\ndata when marketing all prescription drugs, not just those drugs\nwithout any obvious financial or health benefit to patients. That\nargument is at best an assertion that section 1711-E(2-A) is not\nnarrowly tailored enough to serve Maine's interest in reducing\nhealth care costs. We rejected an analogous claim in Ayotte, see\n550 F.3d at 59-60, and the argument has no relevance to our\nalternate holding in Part III.B.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fFurther, Ayotte's alternate holding was that the New Hampshire law\n\nwould be upheld even if it regulated protected speech.    Id. at 54-\n\n60.\n\n                                 B.\n\n           We reject plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge to the\n\nMaine law for a further reason particular to the Maine statute and\n\nindependent of Ayotte.   Even if the Maine law regulates protected\n\nspeech, section 1711-E(2-A) directly serves Maine's substantial\n\ninterest in vindicating Maine prescribers' rights to avoid unwanted\n\ntargeting by detailers in Maine on the basis of their individual\n\nprescribing histories.\n\n           This purpose is not solely about protecting prescribers'\n\nexpectation that their identifying data will remain categorically\n\nprivate.   See Rowe, 532 F. Supp. 2d. at 170-72.   Prescribers' also\n\nhave a privacy interest in avoiding unwanted solicitations from\n\ndetailers who have used their individual prescribing data to\n\nidentify and target them.   Maine's stated interest, in turn, is in\n\nshielding those Maine-licensed prescribers who object to this\n\ninvasive use of their identifying information and who have opted in\n\nto a system of protection the state provides.   Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 22, § 1711-E(1-A)(B),(1-B),(B).    Like laws implementing \"do\n\nnot call\" lists, Maine advances this interest by allowing its\n\nprescribers to join a list to stop their data from being licensed,\n\nused, sold, transferred or exchanged for this unwelcome purpose.\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f          If section 1711-E(2-A) regulates protected speech at all,\n\nit regulates commercial speech, which the Supreme Court has defined\n\nto include \"expression related solely to the economic interests of\n\nthe speaker and its audience.\"       Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 561.\n\nThis circuit and others continue to apply this definition.             See\n\nAyotte, 550 F.3d at 54; see also United States v. Philip Morris USA\n\nInc., 566 F.3d 1095, 1143 (D.C. Cir. 2009); BellSouth Telecomms.,\n\nInc. v. Farris, 542 F.3d 499, 504 (6th Cir. 2008); Procter & Gamble\n\nCo. v. Amway Corp., 242 F.3d 539, 552 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\n          Plaintiffs' purported regulated \"speech\" consists of data\n\ncontained in databases and reports that plaintiffs have designed to\n\nfacilitate detailing.       This is economically motivated content\n\ntailored to a commercial use, namely, to help pharmaceutical\n\nmanufacturers   better    market   brand-name   prescription   drugs    to\n\nparticular prescribers.     Cf. Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp.,\n\n463 U.S. 60, 66-68 (1983) (suggesting that use for an advertising\n\npurpose and the speaker's economic motivations are relevant indicia\n\nof commercial speech).       Plaintiffs' collections of prescriber-\n\nidentifying data, if speech at all, would be commercial speech:\n\ntheir purpose is to \"facilitate the marketing of . . . services to\n\nindividual customers.\"     U.S. W. Inc. v. FCC, 182 F.3d 1224, 1233\n\nn.4 (10th Cir. 1999).14\n\n\n     14\n          Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472\nU.S. 749 (1985), held that a consumer credit report made available\nby a reporting agency to particular subscribers received less First\n\n                                   -22-\n\f          Under the Central Hudson framework, commercial speech is\n\nprotected if it is \"neither misleading nor related to unlawful\n\nactivity.\"    447 U.S. at 564.         That is not at issue here.       Still,\n\nprotected commercial speech can be restricted if the \"asserted\n\ngovernmental interest is substantial,\" \"the regulation directly\n\nadvances the governmental interest asserted,\" and the restriction\n\n\"is not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.\" Id.\n\nat 566; see also Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 55.\n\n          Assuming         the    opt-in      statute   regulates    protected\n\ncommercial speech, Maine meets the test for restricting that\n\nspeech.      Maine   has    a    substantial    interest   in   protecting   its\n\nprescribers from unwanted solicitations by detailers in Maine based\n\non their prescribing histories. \"The unwilling listener's interest\n\nin avoiding unwanted communication,\" the Supreme Court has held,\n\n\"has been repeatedly identified in our cases,\" and it is \"an aspect\n\nof the broader 'right to be let alone' that one of our wisest\n\n\n\nAmendment protection because it was \"solely in the individual\ninterest of the speaker and its specific business audience.\" Id.\nat 762.    Though not explicitly labeled commercial speech, the\nSupreme Court nonetheless concluded that \"many of the same concerns\nthat argue in favor of reduced constitutional protection in those\nareas apply here as well.\" Id. at 762 n.8.\n     Applying these principles in an analogous context, the D.C.\nCircuit held that a blanket prohibition on an intermediary's sale\nof targeted marketing lists identifying particular consumers with\ndesired characteristics was subject to lesser scrutiny. See Trans\nUnion Corp. v. FTC, 245 F.3d 809, 818 (D.C. Cir. 2001).         The\nreports and databases plaintiffs prepare to facilitate detailing\nare indistinguishable from these cases for First Amendment\npurposes. Still, we use the Central Hudson framework.\n\n                                       -23-\n\fJustices characterized as 'the most comprehensive of rights and the\n\nright most valued by civilized men.'\"         Hill v.

United States, 277 U.S.\n\n438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)).\n\n               Maine has a substantial interest in vindicating this\n\nright     by   allowing    Maine-licensed   prescribers   to   avoid   being\n\nsubjected to unwelcome advertisements and solicitations.                The\n\nSupreme Court has recognized this interest in the context of \"do\n\nnot mail\" lists.15        See Rowan v. U.S. Post Office Dep't, 397 U.S.\n\n728, 736-38 (1970) (holding that a federal \"do not mail\" list\n\nserved \"the very basic right to be free from sights, sounds, and\n\ntangible matter we do not want\"); see also FTC v.

It undoubtedly\n\nextends to protecting Maine prescribers who do not want their data\n\nused to facilitate unwanted solicitations.         See Trans Union Corp.\n\nv. FTC, 245 F.3d 809, 818 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (recognizing the\n\ngovernment's \"substantial interest\" in \"protecting the privacy of\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          Though many of these unwanted solicitations invade\nindividuals' right to be left alone in their homes, a location\naccorded special protection, Hill formulated this right as one that\napplies more broadly, with special but not exclusive force in the\nhome.

Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 770-71 (1993)).                Time and again,\n\nthe   record    establishes,       Maine     prescribers    have    not     merely\n\ncomplained about being subjected to detailing; they have identified\n\ndetailers'     use   of   their    personal    prescribing      histories    as    a\n\nsingularly objectionable practice.            Maine's legislature found that\n\nmany prescribers had demanded legislative action to protect their\n\nidentifying     data   from   this    unwanted     use.     §   1711-E(1-A)(B).\n\nSection    1711-E(2-A)      does     not,    and   need    not,    directly       or\n\ncategorically prohibit detailing to address this harm.                    Rather,\n\nMaine provides exactly the protections that Maine prescribers have\n\nrequested and allows prescribers to choose whether to invoke them.\n\n           Maine's opt-in confidentiality mechanism is also a less\n\nrestrictive means of vindicating prescribers' interests in not\n\nhaving their information used in detailing.               See Ayotte, 550 F.3d\n\n\n      16\n          This reasoning also disposes of plaintiffs' assertion\nthat section 1711-E(2-A) is a prior restraint on their speech\nbecause it allows prescribers to prevent plaintiffs from\ntransferring or using their data.   That argument rests on the\nmistaken assumption that plaintiffs have an absolute right to\nobtain prescriber-identifying data and to use it to facilitate\nunwelcome detailing practices.\n\n                                      -25-\n\fat 59.    Targeted prohibitions are by definition less restrictive\n\nthan a categorical ban.       See United States v. Playboy Entm't.\n\nGroup, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 815 (2000); see also Mainstream Mktg.\n\nServs., Inc. v. FTC, 358 F.3d 1228, 1242-43 (10th Cir. 2004).         Opt-\n\nin mechanisms like the \"do not call\" list are narrowly tailored by\n\nnature: they \"restrict only calls that are targeted at unwilling\n\nrecipients.\"   Mainstream Mktg. Servs., 358 F.3d at 1242; see also\n\nFraternal Ord. of Police v. Stenehjem, 431 F.3d 591, 599 (8th Cir.\n\n2005); Nat'l Fed'n of the Blind v. FTC, 420 F.3d 331, 342 (4th Cir.\n\n2005); Bland v. Fessler, 88 F.3d 729, 733 (9th Cir. 1996).           Opt-in\n\nmechanisms also avoid concerns about state paternalism in the First\n\nAmendment context.      They regulate speech (if speech at all) only\n\nwhen private individuals choose not to be subject to certain kinds\n\nof communications, not simply because the state has identified\n\nparticular communications as harmful.     Bland, 88 F.3d at 733.\n\n           Plaintiffs    cursorily   assert   that   Maine   could    have\n\nregulated detailers' free samples to prescribers, educated doctors,\n\nor implemented formulary controls as alternatives to section 1711-\n\nE(2-A).   Ayotte rejected these alternatives as ineffective ways to\n\nadvance a state's interest in health care costs.       550 F.3d at 59-\n\n60.   These alternatives do virtually nothing to advance Maine's\n\ninterest in protecting opted-in Maine prescribers' identifying data\n\n\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\ffrom use in detailing.17     Our analysis also disposes of plaintiffs'\n\nassertion that section 1711-E violates the Fourteenth Amendment as\n\nan economic constraint unrelated to legitimate state interests.\n\n                              IV. Vagueness\n\n            Plaintiffs    also    argue       that   section    1711-E(2-A)'s\n\nprohibition on the use, transfer, licensing, sale, or exchange of\n\nopted-in prescriber-identifying data \"for any marketing purpose\" is\n\nunconstitutionally vague.         Plaintiffs' brief claims that they\n\n\"simply sell the information\" to pharmaceutical manufacturers, and\n\nthey have no intent to market or advertise pharmaceutical products\n\nto prescribers themselves.         Plaintiffs assert that the law is\n\nunconstitutionally vague because they cannot know whether \"any\n\nmarketing   purpose\"     refers   to    their    motivation    in   selling   or\n\nlicensing   the   information     or    to    pharmaceutical   manufacturers'\n\nultimate purpose in obtaining the data.\n\n            Even if there were possible ambiguity in section 1711-\n\nE(2-A)'s terms, the law is still not void for vagueness. Statutory\n\nambiguity is a regular byproduct of legislative drafting, but the\n\n\n     17\n          Plaintiffs also introduced evidence on an AMA initiative\nthat allows medical doctors to signal that they do not want their\nprescribing data used in detailing. But the AMA has no real power\nto limit plaintiffs' and other intermediaries' use of this data;\ncompliance is monitored only through complaints to the AMA, and\nenforcement depends on plaintiffs and other intermediaries'\ngoodwill prevailing over the strong financial incentives to use\nthis data.    Moreover, the AMA scheme does not cover a host of\nprescribers like nurse practitioners or osteopathic physicians, who\nmight want to protect their prescribing data but are ineligible for\nthe AMA scheme.\n\n                                       -27-\n\fvagueness doctrine invalidates only statutes whose terms are \"so\n\nuncertain that persons of average intelligence would have no choice\n\nbut to guess at [their] meaning and modes of application.\"               United\n\nStates   v.    Nieves-Castaño,   480   F.3d   597,   603   (1st   Cir.   2007)\n\n(quoting United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (en banc)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\n\nRidley v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 390 F.3d 65, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nWhatever ambiguity lurks in the phrase \"any marketing purpose,\" the\n\nlaw's lengthy definition of the term \"marketing,\" see supra note 6,\n\nsurely provides enough of a benchmark to satisfy due process.\n\n              Further, this purported ambiguity does not exist on the\n\nfacts: plaintiffs, at minimum, intend for their databases and\n\nreports to facilitate detailing.       Plaintiffs portray themselves as\n\nunwitting middlemen that sell prescriber-identifying information to\n\ntheir clients with no knowledge or control of its ultimate use.\n\nPlaintiffs' depositions and statements at oral argument reveal\n\ninstead that they are well aware that the primary and intended use\n\nof their reports and databases is in detailing.\n\n                       V. Dormant Commerce Clause\n\n              Plaintiffs'   final   constitutional    challenge     is    that\n\nsection 1711-E(2-A), \"as it is applied to the transactions in which\n\nthey engage out of the state and are shown by the record evidence,\"\n\n\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\fviolates the dormant Commerce Clause.18 Because plaintiffs obtained\n\nan injunction before section 1711-E(2-A) went into effect, however,\n\nthe state has not promulgated regulations under this section, there\n\nis no state decisional law, and the law has never been applied.19\n\n\n     18\n          The Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the authority\nto \"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States,\" U.S. Const.\nart I, § 8, cl. 3, also carries negative or implicit consequences\nfor states' authority to regulate interstate commerce, referred to\nas the \"dormant Commerce Clause.\" There is no claim that Congress\nhas acted and that Maine's statute must fail on that basis.\n     19\n          In recent years, the Supreme Court has sharply\ndistinguished between facial and as-applied challenges, stringently\nlimiting the availability of the former. See, e.g., Wash. State\nGrange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 450-51\n(2008); see also G.E. Metzger, Facial Challenges and Federalism,\n105 Colum. L. Rev. 873, 878-80 (2005) (questioning whether the\nSupreme Court follows this doctrinal position in practice).\n     We did not address this distinction in Ayotte: plaintiffs'\ndormant Commerce Clause challenge to the New Hampshire statute\nthere was plainly identified as a facial challenge. See Ayotte,\n550 F.3d at 63.\n     Here, plaintiffs say they are not making any facial challenge.\nThere is some question as to whether plaintiffs' pre-enforcement\nchallenge can be properly characterized as an as-applied challenge.\nPlaintiffs have introduced record evidence showing that their use\nor sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' identifying data occurs\noutside Maine and that they are \"prescription drug information\nintermediaries\" and thus potentially subject to regulation under\nsection 1711-E(2-A). But plaintiffs argue that the law applies to\ntheir transactions only based on their statutory construction.\n     We accept plaintiffs' characterization of their argument as a\nchallenge only to section 1711-E(2-A) as it applies to plaintiffs,\nas prescription drug information intermediaries, and not as to\npharmacies and other entities. See Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz,\nP.A. v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 1324, 1339 & n.7 (2010). We also\nassume arguendo that plaintiffs' challenge is not subject to the\nrestrictions on facial challenges.         But we cannot accept\nplaintiffs' assertion that section 1711-E(2-A) applies to their\nout-of-state transactions without engaging in our own statutory\nanalysis. Here, the issue is not whether plaintiffs belong to a\nclass of entities that section 1711-E(2-A) plainly regulates\nextraterritorially; it is how to interpret section 1711-E(2-A)'s\n\n                               -29-\n\fPlaintiffs assert that they are \"prescription drug information\n\nintermediaries\" as defined in section 1711-E, and Maine does not\n\ndispute this.      Cf. Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United\n\nStates, 130 S. Ct. 1324, 1339 & n.7 (2010).\n\n           Plaintiffs'      challenge   presents       questions      of   whether\n\nsection 1711-E(2-A) would be interpreted under Maine law to apply\n\nto   plaintiffs'    out-of-state     use   or    sale    of    opted-in      Maine\n\nprescribers'    identifying    data,    including      whether     the     rule    of\n\nconstitutional avoidance requires the statute to be interpreted not\n\nto apply to plaintiffs' out-of-state transactions.20                  As a matter\n\nof law, we hold that the statute applies to plaintiffs' out-of-\n\nstate use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' identifying data\n\nand that the statute does so constitutionally.                 We also reject\n\nplaintiffs'    claim   at   oral   argument     that    we   should    leave      the\n\ndistrict court's injunction in place and remand this claim for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n           Plaintiffs interpret section 1711-E(2-A) to apply to\n\ntheir out-of-state transactions based on their construction of its\n\ntext.     They claim that the regulation violates the so-called\n\n\"extraterritoriality\" branch of the dormant Commerce Clause, which\n\n\nintended scope.     Cf. id. at 1339.\n     20\n          We do not decide whether section 1711-E(2-A) applies to\npharmacies'   or   pharmaceutical   manufacturers'    out-of-state\ntransactions involving opted-in Maine prescribers.    There is no\nindication that these entities cannot effectively assert their own\nrights insofar as they are affected by section 1711-E(2-A).\n\n                                    -30-\n\fthey say prohibits direct regulation of interstate commerce that\n\noccurs wholly outside a state's borders.        In the alternative,\n\nplaintiffs assert, this regulation violates the Pike balancing test\n\n\"because it does nothing to advance in-state interests and imposes\n\na heavy burden on interstate activity.\"\n\n          We reject plaintiffs' arguments.     We interpret section\n\n1711-E(2-A)'s scope by applying the rules of statutory construction\n\nthat the state's highest court would follow.    Ayotte, 550 F.3d at\n\n61; see also Adar v. Smith, 597 F.3d 697, 714 (5th Cir. 2010).   We\n\nhold, based on the text and legislative backdrop of section 1711-\n\nE(2-A) and Maine's canons of statutory construction, that section\n\n1711-E(2-A) regulates plaintiffs' out-of-state use or sale of\n\nopted-in Maine prescribers' identifying data.\n\n          We further hold that this interpretation of the statute\n\ndoes not raise constitutional concerns under the dormant Commerce\n\nClause.   The Supreme Court's current dormant Commerce Clause\n\njurisprudence is concerned with preventing economic protectionism\n\nand inconsistent regulation, not with enforcing geographical limits\n\non states' exercise of their police power that necessarily regulate\n\ncommerce. Even under the extraterritoriality branch of the dormant\n\nCommerce Clause, the Supreme Court has not barred states from\n\nregulating any commercial transactions beyond their borders that\n\ninvolve their own citizens and create in-state harms. Nor does the\n\nMaine law create constitutional concerns under the Pike balancing\n\n\n                               -31-\n\ftest.   Plaintiffs have not shown any disproportionate burden on\n\ninterstate commerce, and the law creates substantial in-state\n\nbenefits for those Maine prescribers who have affirmatively asked\n\nMaine to protect their identifying data and for Maine in its\n\nefforts to lower health care costs.\n\n               A. Section 1711-E(2-A)'s Text and Setting\n\n          The text of the statute shows section 1711-E(2-A) was\n\nintended to apply to plaintiffs' out-of-state use or sale of opted-\n\nin Maine prescribers' identifying data.         The statutory text shows\n\nthat section 1711-E(2-A) was designed to address a significant\n\nproblem occurring in Maine, whose solution has some cross-border\n\nimplications.      The law is concerned only with \"prescribers in the\n\nhealth care system of [Maine],\" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22,\n\n§ 1711-E(1-B), not prescribers anywhere in the United States, and\n\nspecifically    those   prescribers    who   have   opted   in   to   Maine's\n\n\"mechanism   for    protecting   the   confidentiality      of   identifying\n\nprescription drug information from use for marketing purposes,\" id.\n\n§ 1711-E(1-A)(B).       The statute further recognizes that these\n\nmarketing uses occur \"[a]cross the nation\" when \"data companies\n\npurchase for marketing purposes computerized prescription drug\n\nrecords from pharmacies and insurers that identify prescribers.\"\n\nId. § 1711-E(1-A)(C).     The statutory text also identifies specific\n\nharms arising from these transactions--invasions of prescribers'\n\n\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fprivacy, increased health care costs, and harms to public health--\n\nas occurring in Maine.       See § 1711-E(1-B).\n\n          Section 1711-E(2-A)'s context confirms that the Maine\n\nLegislature intended to reach plaintiffs' out-of-state conduct\n\nbecause of its substantial connections to Maine and because it\n\ncauses harms exclusively in Maine.           Section 1711-E(2-A) targets a\n\nseries of underlying transactions that cause these harms, which\n\nstart and end in Maine, even if all the transactions covered in\n\norder to effectuate the statute's purposes do not occur in Maine.\n\nMaine prescribers' prescriptions are primarily, if not exclusively,\n\nfilled at Maine pharmacies.          Data from those Maine pharmacies are\n\nultimately      transferred     to      prescription      drug     information\n\nintermediaries like plaintiffs through contractual arrangements.\n\nPlaintiffs'     subsequent    use     and    sale   of   Maine    prescribers'\n\nidentifying   data   to   generate     detailing-oriented        databases   and\n\nreports may occur outside Maine, but those activities are bound up\n\nwith pharmaceutical manufacturers' ultimate use of the information\n\nin detailing that targets Maine prescribers in Maine.\n\n          The law also takes effect only if Maine prescribers\n\naffirmatively    indicate     that    they   want   Maine   to    protect    the\n\nconfidentiality of their identifying information.            See id. § 1711-\n\nE(1)(G-1), (2-A), (4).         Every intermediate step is limited to\n\ntransactions involving these prescribers' identifying data.                  See\n\nid. § 1711-E(2-A).        The law's ultimate effect is to prevent\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\fdetailers with Maine routes from targeting Maine prescribers with\n\ntheir own prescribing histories.           Id. § 1711-E(1-A), (1-B).\n\n              B. Presumption against Extraterritoriality\n\n          Our interpretation of section 1711-E(2-A) also comports\n\nwith Maine's canons of statutory construction.              Maine, like other\n\nstates,   generally        presumes       its    statutes       do   not    apply\n\nextraterritorially    in    the    absence      of   contrary   indications     of\n\nlegislative intent.     See Holbrook v. Libby, 94 A. 482, 483 (Me.\n\n1915); see also 73 Am. Jur. 2d Statutes § 250 (2010).                         That\n\npresumption    is   overcome      here:   the    Maine   Legislature       plainly\n\nintended section 1711-E(2-A) to regulate plaintiffs' out-of-state\n\nuse or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' identifying data.21\n\n          Maine's presumption against extraterritoriality reflects\n\ninherent limitations on the scope of states' sovereign regulatory\n\npowers.   See Stavis Ipswich Clam Co. v. Green, 236 A.2d 708, 712\n\n(Me. 1968).    This presumption is not a per se rule because those\n\nstate powers are not mechanically limited to conduct occurring\n\nwithin a state's physical borders.           As one learned commentator has\n\nnoted, \"[i]n practice, states exert regulatory control over each\n\nother all the time . . . . [A] state's geographic territory does\n\nnot mark the outer limit of its legitimate regulatory concern.\"\n\n\n     21\n          In Ayotte, this court held that the presumption against\nconstruing New Hampshire's statute to apply extraterritorially had\nnot been overcome, not least because the New Hampshire Attorney\nGeneral insisted that New Hampshire only sought to regulate conduct\nwithin its borders. 550 F.3d at 63-64.\n\n                                      -34-\n\fG.E. Metzger, Congress, Article IV, and Interstate Relations, 120\n\nHarv. L. Rev. 1468, 1521-22 (2007).              Indeed, an entire body of\n\nconflict   of    laws   cases   apply   state    laws   to   extraterritorial\n\nconduct.     See K. Florey, State Courts, State Territory, State\n\nPower: Reflections on the Extraterritoriality Principle in Choice\n\nof Law and Legislation, 84 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1057, 1073-74 (2009).\n\n           Maine, like other states, has construed its laws to apply\n\nto   extraterritorial      conduct   with    a   substantial   impact   in   or\n\nconnection to Maine's residents or licensees.            See, e.g., State v.\n\nHayes, 603 A.2d 869, 870 (Me. 1992) (upholding the extraterritorial\n\nenforcement of Maine's lobster laws to vessels registered in\n\nMaine); Dissell v. Trans World Airlines, 511 A.2d 441, 444-45 (Me.\n\n1986) (applying Maine's worker's compensation statute to require an\n\nout-of-state airline to further compensate a flight attendant\n\nstationed and injured out of state but residing in Maine because of\n\nsufficient      contacts    with     Maine).22      Section     1711-E(2-A)'s\n\napplication to plaintiffs is within Maine's sovereign authority.\n\n\n\n      22\n          Other states have similarly recognized that \"a state may\nhave the power to legislate concerning the rights and obligations\nof its citizens with regard to transactions occurring beyond its\nboundaries.\" N. Alaska Salmon Co. v. Pillsbury, 162 P. 93 (Cal.\n1916); see also Sexton v. Ryder Truck Rental, Inc., 320 N.W.2d 843,\n854 (Mich. 1982); 73 Am. Jur. 2d Statutes § 250 (2010). Numerous\ntypes of state statutes have extraterritorial effect. See, e.g.,\nState v. Flores, 188 P.3d 706, 710 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2008) (criminal\nlaws); Boca Petroco, Inc. v. Petroleum Realty II, LLC, 678 S.E.2d\n330, 333-34 (Ga. 2009) (lis pendens statutes); Heath Consultants,\nInc. v. Precision Instruments, Inc., 527 N.W.2d 596, 607 (Neb.\n1995) (antitrust law).\n\n                                      -35-\n\f   C. Constitutional Avoidance and the Dormant Commerce Clause\n\n            Finally, we reject the argument that section 1711-E(2-\n\nA)'s application to prescription drug information intermediaries'\n\nout-of-state use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' identifying\n\ndata would raise constitutional concerns under the dormant Commerce\n\nClause.23    Under      Maine   and    federal     law,    we    must    \"avoid   an\n\nunconstitutional     construction       of     a   statute      if   a   reasonable\n\ninterpretation     of    the    statute       would    satisfy       constitutional\n\nrequirements.\"    Anderson v. Town of Durham, 895 A.2d 944, 951 (Me.\n\n2006) (quoting Bagley v. Raymond Sch. Dep't, 728 A.2d 127, 133 (Me.\n\n1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                There is no need for\n\nconstitutional avoidance here.\n\n            We   begin   with    the   Supreme        Court's    current   dormant\n\nCommerce Clause jurisprudence, which provides no foundation for\n\nplaintiffs' contention that Maine's regulation of their out-of-\n\nstate use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' data would raise\n\nconstitutional concerns.         The dormant Commerce Clause sets two\n\ncomplementary     boundaries     for    states'       regulatory      powers   over\n\n\n     23\n          The Maine Attorney General has argued that the law\nregulates persons or entities over whom Maine can exercise personal\njurisdiction.   That interpretation states a limitation on any\nextraterritorial application of a statute: it must comport with the\nrequirements of the Due Process and Full Faith and Credit Clauses.\nAllstate Ins. Co. v. Hague, 449 U.S. 302, 308 (1981). Plaintiffs\nhave not argued that section 1711-E(2-A)'s application to their\nout-of-state transactions would violate those provisions. But that\ndoes not by definition alleviate constitutional concerns under the\ndormant Commerce Clause, which serves different purposes. Quill\nCorp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 312-13 (1992).\n\n                                       -36-\n\fcommerce.     On one hand, states cannot interfere with Congress's\n\nconstitutional authority over interstate commerce by enacting laws\n\nthat seriously impede interstate commerce, even when Congress has\n\nnot acted.       See Dep't of Revenue v. Davis, 553 U.S. 328, 337-38\n\n(2008).24    On the other hand, states \"retain authority under their\n\ngeneral police powers to regulate matters of legitimate local\n\nconcern, even though interstate commerce may be affected.\"              Maine\n\nv. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 138 (1986) (quoting Lewis v. BT Inv.\n\nManagers, Inc., 447 U.S. 27, 36 (1980)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).        Further, in fields traditionally subject to state\n\nregulation, federal courts \"should be particularly hesitant to\n\ninterfere with [states'] efforts under the guise of the Commerce\n\nClause.\" United Haulers Ass'n, Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste\n\nMgmt. Auth., 550 U.S. 330, 344 (2007) (alterations in original).\n\n            As    to   the   first   of   these   boundaries,   \"the   dormant\n\nCommerce Clause is driven by concern about 'economic protectionism-\n\n-that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic\n\ninterests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\"           Davis, 553 U.S.\n\nat 337-38 (quoting New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269,\n\n\n     24\n          This limitation on states' powers is grounded in the\nhistorical origins of the Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the\npower to \"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.\" U.S.\nConst. Art I, § 8, cl. 3. The Framers saw this as an essential\nelement of the Constitution to avoid the \"economic Balkanization\"\nthat had prevailed under the Articles of Confederation, under which\nstates had enacted rampant tariffs and other trade barriers at the\nprice of national economic unity. See Davis, 553 U.S. at 337-38;\nGranholm v. Heald, 544 U.S. 460, 472 (2005).\n\n                                      -37-\n\f273) (1988)).         Similar concerns about hidden protectionism and\n\nexcessive barriers to interstate trade arise when states enact laws\n\nlikely to subject entities engaged in interstate commerce to\n\nincompatible cross-state regulatory regimes, see CTS Corp. v.\n\nDynamics Corp. of Am., 481 U.S. 69, 88-89 (1987); S. Pac. Co. v.\n\nAriz. ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U.S. 761, 767-68 (1945), or laws with\n\nminimal     in-state     benefits    and   a   disproportionate   impact   on\n\ninterstate commerce, see Pike, 397 U.S. at 142.\n\n                These concerns are central to the way the Supreme Court\n\nhas framed the dormant Commerce Clause in its recent opinions. The\n\nMaine     law    implicates   none    of   them.    Maine's   regulation   of\n\nprescription drug information intermediaries' out-of-state use or\n\nsale of opted-in Maine prescribers' data does not discriminate\n\nagainst out-of-state entities in favor of in-state competitors, nor\n\ndo plaintiffs so argue.              Maine's law does not risk imposing\n\nregulatory obligations inconsistent with those of other states. No\n\nother states have erected competing regulations, much less opposing\n\nregulations requiring the transfer of Maine prescribers' data.25\n\nThis is simply not an example of a state engaged in economic\n\nprotectionism.       Cf. Davis, 553 U.S. at 337-39.26\n\n\n\n     25\n          Though New Hampshire and Vermont's laws differ somewhat\nfrom Maine's, neither purports to regulate any prescriber anywhere.\n     26\n          Nor, as we discuss below, would this interpretation of\nsection 1711-E(2-A) result in excessive burdens on interstate\ncommerce relative to in-state benefits.\n\n                                       -38-\n\f           Maine's interests, on the other hand, are precisely the\n\nkind of traditional state concerns that the Supreme Court has\n\nidentified as falling outside the reach of the dormant Commerce\n\nClause.   See Davis, 553 U.S. at 342; United Haulers, 550 U.S. at\n\n344-45.   States are \"vested with the responsibility of protecting\n\nthe health, safety, and welfare of [their] citizens.\" United\n\nHaulers, 550 U.S. at 342.            To serve those interests, states\n\nexercise the kind of local autonomy essential to federalism.               \"The\n\nessence of our federal system is that within the realm of authority\n\nleft open to them under the Constitution, the States must be\n\nequally free to engage in any activity that their citizens choose\n\nfor the common weal.\"       Davis, 553 U.S. at 338 (quoting Garcia v.\n\nSan   Antonio    Metro.   Transit    Auth.,    469   U.S.   528,   546   (1985))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Maine has a uniquely strong interest in protecting Maine\n\nprescribers who have invoked Maine's regulatory authority through\n\nthe opt-in scheme.        Cf. CTS, 481 U.S. at 89. Maine has done so\n\nbecause these commercial transactions also harm the public health\n\nand   increase    Maine's   health    care    costs.    In   advancing    these\n\ninterests, Maine has regulated in a traditional area of state\n\nconcern without undercutting other states' regulatory schemes or\n\nencroaching on their interests.        Maine's choice must be respected.\n\n           The Maine statute falls outside the central concerns of\n\nthe Court's dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence for another\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\freason.     Maine has not shifted the costs of regulation to other\n\nstates whose voters cannot affect its legislative choices, nor does\n\nthe Maine law \"hand local businesses a victory they could not\n\nobtain through the political process.\" United Haulers, 550 U.S. at\n\n345.    Maine's political processes produced this statute, and Maine\n\nvoters can, if they disagree, reverse this policy.\n\n            Plaintiffs ignore these foundational principles; indeed,\n\nplaintiffs ignore virtually every Supreme Court dormant Commerce\n\nClause case after 1989.    Instead, plaintiffs say section 1711-E(2-\n\nA)'s application to their conduct would violate an infrequently\n\napplied strand of the dormant Commerce Clause loosely labeled\n\nextraterritoriality.27    Its central premise is that \"a statute that\n\ndirectly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries\n\nof a State exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting State's\n\nauthority and is invalid regardless of whether the statute's\n\nextraterritorial reach was intended by the legislature.\"    Healy v.\n\nBeer Inst., Inc., 491 U.S. 324, 336 (1989) (emphasis added); see\n\n\n       27\n          Extraterritoriality has been the dormant branch of the\ndormant Commerce Clause.    Despite a host of subsequent dormant\nCommerce Clause cases, see, e.g., Davis, 553 U.S. 328; United\nHaulers, 550 U.S. 330; Am. Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v. Mich. Pub.\nServ. Comm'n, 545 U.S. 429 (2005); Granholm, 544 U.S. 460, the\nSupreme Court last mentioned the doctrine in a paragraph of a 2003\ndecision to reject its applicability. The Court pointedly referred\nto it as \"[t]he rule that was applied in Baldwin and Healy,\" cases\ndecided in 1935 and 1989. Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Walsh,\n538 U.S. 644, 669 (2003) (citing Healy, 491 U.S. 324; Baldwin v.\nG.A.F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511 (1935)). We nonetheless assume\nthis doctrine remains viable. See State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S.\n3, 20 (1997). Even so, plaintiffs' challenge fails.\n\n                                 -40-\n\falso Alliance of Auto Mfrs. v. Gwadowsky, 430 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    Plaintiffs further suggest that this doctrine applies not\n\nto the Maine law as applied to prescription drug information\n\nintermediaries but to their atomized transactions only. Plaintiffs\n\nmake no attempt to square these principles with the Court's current\n\ndormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence or to explain how these\n\nprinciples fit with its central concerns.         In any event, this\n\ndoctrine is inapplicable.\n\n           Whatever the present scope of the extraterritoriality\n\ndoctrine, it clearly does not require per se invalidation of all\n\nextraterritorial   applications    contained   within   state   statutes\n\nregulating commerce.28 Section 1711-E(2-A) does not regulate wholly\n\nextraterritorial   commercial   transactions.     Its   regulation   of\n\nplaintiffs' use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' data affects\n\nonly Maine prescribers and regulates transactions that impact\n\nMaine, with incidental effects elsewhere. It is instead one of \"an\n\ninfinite variety of cases in which regulation of local matters may\n\n\n     28\n          Some circuits have simply framed the doctrine in terms of\nconcerns with preventing economic protectionism or inconsistent\nregulatory regimes, see, e.g., Cloverland-Green Spring Dairies,\nInc. v. Penn. Milk Mktg. Bd., 462 F.3d 249, 262-63 (3d Cir. 2006);\nPharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon, 249 F.3d 66, 81-83\n(1st Cir. 2001), aff'd sub nom. Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am., 538\nU.S. 644, or have suggested that the Court's cases do not dictate\n\"the notion that direct and facial regulation of extraterritorial\ntransactions is absolutely banned,\" Alliant Energy Corp. v. Bie,\n336 F. 3d 545, 547-50 (7th Cir. 2003); see also J. Goldsmith & A.\nSykes, The Internet and the Dormant Commerce Clause, 110 Yale L.J.\n785, 789-90 & n.26 (2001).\n\n                                  -41-\n\falso operate as a regulation of commerce,\" requiring \"appraisal and\n\naccommodation of the competing demands of the state and national\n\ninterests involved.\"    S. Pac. Co., 325 U.S. at 768-69.29\n\n          The   Supreme     Court     has    applied      the   so-called\n\nextraterritoriality doctrine sparingly, and in ways that only\n\nreinforce the conclusion that Maine can regulate plaintiffs' out-\n\nof-state use and sale of Maine prescribers' identifying data.        The\n\nCourt has only struck down two related types of statutes on\n\nextraterritoriality    grounds.     The   first   are   price-affirmation\n\nstatutes that force regulated entities to certify that the in-state\n\nprice they charge for a good is no higher than the price they\n\n\n     29\n          Limitations on states' regulation of extraterritorial\ncommerce have been justified because \"one State's power to impose\nburdens on the interstate market . . . is also constrained by the\nneed to respect the interests of other States.\" BMW of N. Am. v.\nGore, 517 U.S. 559, 571 (1996) (internal citation omitted); see\nalso Healy, 491 U.S. at 336-37.\n     That has never meant that states are powerless to regulate all\ntransactions beyond their borders, including transactions involving\ntheir citizens.   States' interests may justify extraterritorial\nregulation in contexts ranging from taxation under the dormant\nCommerce Clause, see, e.g., MeadWestvaco Corp. ex rel. Mead Corp.\nv. Ill. Dep't of Revenue, 553 U.S. 16, 24-25 (2008), to the\nenforcement of criminal and tort law, see, e.g., Young v. Masci,\n289 U.S. 253, 259 (1933); Strassheim v. Daily, 221 U.S. 280, 285\n(1911) (Holmes, J.); see also Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809,\n834-35 & 834 n.2 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\n     The Edgar v. MITE plurality reasoned that \"[t]he limits on a\nState's power to enact substantive legislation are similar to the\nlimits on the jurisdiction of state courts.\"       457 U.S. at 643\n(plurality opinion). But the expansion of personal jurisdiction\nbeyond the rigid geographical rules of Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S.\n714 (1877), to the nexus-oriented approach of International Shoe\nCo. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), only reinforces the fact\nthat states' jurisdiction--whether legislative or adjudicatory--is\nnot categorically limited to their territory in any context.\n\n                                  -42-\n\fcharge out of state.     See Healy, 491 U.S. at 337-40; Brown-Forman,\n\n476 U.S. at 582-84; Baldwin, 294 U.S. at 521-22.            The second are\n\nstatutes that \"force an out-of-state merchant to seek regulatory\n\napproval in one State before undertaking a transaction in another.\"\n\nHealy, 491 U.S. at 337; see also Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U.S. at\n\n627, 642-43 (plurality opinion).             Even these statutes are not\n\ninvariably struck down.        See CTS, 481 U.S. at 88-89 (upholding a\n\nstatute regulating takeovers of corporations with a strong in-state\n\nnexus by limiting the acquisition of control shares).\n\n          The    Maine   law    is   easily    distinguishable    from    the\n\ninvalidated statutes.     Those state statutes--unlike section 1711-\n\nE(2-A)--raised   independent      concerns     about   protectionism   under\n\nestablished strands of the dormant Commerce Clause.30             Moreover,\n\nunlike the Maine law, none of the invalidated statutes dealt with\n\nharms caused exclusively inside the regulating state. Nor were the\n\ninvalidated statutes limited to regulating transactions with a\n\nsignificant   inherent   connection     to    the   regulating   state,   and\n\ninvolving its own professional licensees.           Those differences, and\n\n\n     30\n          The challenged price-affirmation laws were also deemed\nunconstitutional because they discriminated against out-of-state\nentities in favor of in-state competitors, see Healy, 491 U.S. at\n340-41; Baldwin, 294 U.S. at 522, or because of their protectionist\neffects for consumers, Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 580. Likewise,\nonly a plurality in Edgar v. MITE would have invalidated on\nextraterritoriality grounds the challenged Illinois law, which\nrequired companies to obtain regulatory approval for takeover bids\nof corporations with no real relation to Illinois. See 451 U.S. at\n641 (plurality opinion). The majority only invalidated the law as\nan excessive burden on interstate commerce under Pike. Id. at 644.\n\n                                     -43-\n\fnot   the   mere     fact   that   those   statutes   directly   regulated\n\nout-of-state transactions, explain why the Supreme Court deemed\n\nthose statutes wholly extraterritorial.31\n\n            Plaintiffs' attempt to analogize the Maine law to these\n\ncases fails.       The Supreme Court has previously distinguished and\n\nupheld a state statute that regulated out-of-state commercial\n\ntransactions with a clear in-state nexus and impact.         See CTS, 481\n\nU.S. at 93.32       Other circuits have upheld similar laws on this\n\n\n      31\n          Baldwin involved a New York price affirmation statute\nthat required out-of-state milk buyers to certify that they paid\nout-of-state milk producers no more than what New York producers\nreceived.   See 294 U.S. at 519.     The Court deemed the law an\nimpermissible attempt to project New York's pricing regime on other\nstates because it had no \"direct and certain\" relationship to New\nYork's asserted interest in ensuring a supply of sanitary milk, id.\nat 524, and the asserted purpose of protecting local farmers'\neconomic welfare was impermissibly protectionist, id. at 523.\n     In Edgar v. MITE, the plurality found the Illinois corporate\ntakeover bid law had a \"sweeping extraterritorial effect\" because\nit would \"regulate a tender offer which would not affect a single\nIllinois shareholder\" and thus reached conduct in which Illinois\nhad no conceivable interest. 457 U.S. at 642 (plurality opinion).\n     Likewise, the price affirmation statutes in Healy and\nBrown-Forman were not limited to transactions involving the\nregulating state; they made in-state prices that out-of-state\nshippers charged for alcohol contingent on the price those shippers\ncharged elsewhere. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 326-27; Brown-Forman,\n476 U.S. at 576. The only in-state interest served by such laws,\nthe Court suggested, was to illegitimately protect local interests.\nSee Healy, 491 U.S. at 340-41; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 580.\n      32\n          In CTS, the Supreme Court rejected an extraterritoriality\nchallenge to an Indiana statute limiting out-of-state tender\nofferors' acquisition of control shares in certain corporations.\nThe Court reasoned that the law was limited \"only to corporations\nincorporated in Indiana\" with substantial numbers of shareholders\nin Indiana, and therefore \"every application of the Indiana Act\nwill affect a substantial number of Indiana residents, whom Indiana\nindisputably has an interest in protecting.\" 481 U.S. at 93.\n\n                                    -44-\n\fbasis.      See, e.g., Quik Payday, Inc. v. Stork, 549 F.3d 1302, 1308-\n\n09 (10th Cir. 2008); S. Union Co. v. Mo. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 289\n\nF.3d 503, 507-08 (8th Cir. 2002); Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co. v.\n\nHeintz, 760 F.2d 1408, 1421-27 (4th Cir. 1985); cf. Am. Booksellers\n\nFound.      v.    Dean,   342   F.3d   96,   103-04   (2d   Cir.   2003).   That\n\nreasoning, not the broad rule plaintiffs try to derive from Healy\n\nand its antecedents, governs here.33            Under these circumstances, we\n\nhold that section 1711-E(2-A)'s regulation of plaintiffs' conduct\n\ndoes        not      raise      constitutional        concerns      under   the\n\nextraterritoriality branch of the dormant Commerce Clause.\n\n                 Finally, we reject plaintiffs' alternate contention that\n\nsection 1711-E(2-A) would raise constitutional concerns under Pike\n\nif applied to plaintiffs' out-of-state transactions.34                Plaintiffs\n\n\n       33\n          This holding does not put our circuit at odds with a\nrecent panel opinion of the Seventh Circuit. Midwest Title Loans,\nInc. v. Mills invalidated on extraterritoriality grounds a\nprovision of an Indiana statute that forbade lenders that solicited\nor advertised their lending services in Indiana from making title\nloans to Indiana residents, unless they obtained a license from\nIndiana (and thereby agreed to be bound by Indiana's restrictions\non the kind of loans permitted). See 593 F.3d 660, 662, 669 (7th\nCir. 2010).    Midwest Title reasoned that states should not be\nallowed to control interstate commerce to prevent their citizens\nfrom engaging in out-of-state conduct that the regulating state\n(but not the citizens themselves) deems harmful. See id. at 663-\n65, 666, 669.\n     The Maine law does not raise similar concerns. It regulates\nonly data from those Maine prescribers who have asked Maine to\nprotect their data. It does not force other states to apply the\nregulating state's paternalistic regulatory choices even when its\nresidents want to engage in prohibited conduct elsewhere.\n       34\n          We need not decide whether the Pike balancing test\nrequires courts to look to the relative benefits and burdens of the\n\n                                        -45-\n\fdid not make this argument to the district court; their brief on\n\nappeal cursorily asserts that the law has no in-state benefits and\n\nonly out-of-state costs.        That is waiver.           See Mass. Museum of\n\nContemporary Art Found. v. Büchel, 593 F.3d 38, 65 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n            This claim is also meritless.             \"State laws frequently\n\nsurvive this Pike scrutiny,\" Davis, 553 U.S. at 339, and section\n\n1711-E(2-A) is no exception. To date, 259 Maine prescribers out of\n\nMaine's     7,500   total    prescribers       have   opted   in    to    Maine's\n\nconfidentiality protections.         Section 1711-E(2-A)'s regulation of\n\nplaintiffs' transactions would confer clear in-state benefits by\n\nenabling those prescribers to avoid unwanted targeting in Maine.\n\n            Nothing suggests that the costs to interstate commerce\n\nwould be disproportionate in relation to these benefits.                 The loss\n\nof several hundred data points in Maine, out of some 7,500 total\n\nMaine   prescribers    and   1.5    million    prescribers    nationwide,      is\n\nunlikely to seriously impact the marketability of plaintiffs'\n\nproducts.     Nor have plaintiffs shown that the costs of complying\n\nwith    section     1711-E(2-A)'s     protections       meaningfully      burden\n\ninterstate    commerce.      There   is   no    obvious    reason   why   cross-\n\n\nstatute as a whole or only to its effect on prescription drug\ninformation intermediaries. Plaintiffs have provided no data about\nrange of prescription drug information intermediaries subject to\nsection 1711-E(2-A) or the relative proportion of overall business\ntransacted in Maine versus outside it. Plaintiffs' Pike challenge\narguably fails on that basis alone; the Pike balancing test is\nabout burdens on the interstate market as a whole, not about\nburdens on particular firms. Even looking only to the law's impact\non plaintiffs' out-of-state transactions, the argument fails.\n\n                                     -46-\n\f    referencing the Maine Health Data Organization's list of opted-in\n\n    Maine prescribers to avoid using or selling this data would prove\n\n    particularly costly or difficult, let alone enough to warrant\n\n    invalidation of a state law.      We also heed the cautionary note the\n\n    Court sounded in Davis: federal courts have less institutional\n\n    competence than states in measuring the costs and benefits of\n\n    particular state regulatory schemes.         See 553 U.S. at 355-57.\n\n                                        VI.\n\n                The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the\n\n    case   is   remanded   with   instructions   to   dismiss   the   case   with\n\n    prejudice.    Costs are awarded to the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                           -Concurring Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n                                       -47-\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.                 The\n\nMaine     statute    at   issue   here,   like   the   New   Hampshire   law    we\n\nconsidered in IMS Health Inc. v. Ayotte, 550 F.3d 42 (1st Cir.\n\n2008), is a creative effort to meet escalating concerns about the\n\nhigh cost of prescription drugs and the way they are marketed.\n\nOther states have passed or considered similar legislation.                   See,\n\ne.g., IMS Health Inc. v. Sorrell, 631 F. Supp. 2d 434, 446 (D. Vt.\n\n2009) (addressing a Vermont statute);35 IMS Health Corp. v. Rowe,\n\n532 F. Supp. 2d 153, 180 n.41 (D. Me. 2008) (noting initiatives in\n\nother     states);    Michael     Heesters,   Comment,   An   Assault    on    the\n\nBusiness of Pharmaceutical Data Mining, 11 U. Pa. J. Bus. L. 789,\n\n791 (2009) (same).        The two statutes that we have reviewed, along\n\nwith Vermont's, are aimed at restricting the messages that may be\n\npresented by pharmaceutical detailers to prescribers.                    Because\n\nthese provisions have the purpose and effect of regulating the\n\ncontent of speech, their compatibility with the First Amendment is\n\na challenging issue that inevitably will be considered by the\n\nSupreme Court.\n\n             The statutes specifically seek to prevent pharmaceutical\n\ndetailers from using the prescribing histories of individual health\n\ncare professionals in their marketing approach to prescribers.                  In\n\nthe view of the States, these individualized sales pitches result\n\n\n     35\n       The decision in Sorrell has been appealed to the Second\nCircuit, and oral argument in the case (No. 09-1913) was heard on\nOctober 13, 2009.\n\n                                       -48-\n\fin the over-prescription of high-priced, brand-name drugs, thereby\n\nneedlessly increasing public expenditures on prescription drugs\n\nand, at times, harming patient health.36            In an effort to minimize\n\nthe First Amendment implications of their content-based goal, Maine\n\nand New Hampshire attempted to cut off access to the prescribing\n\ninformation at its source.       Hence, the statutes prohibit the sale,\n\ntransfer   or    other    dissemination       of    prescriber-identifiable\n\ninformation among pharmacies and other data-collecting entities for\n\nmarketing purposes, but impose no direct limitation on the drug\n\ncompanies or sales people who do the actual marketing.37 The States\n\ninsist that the laws thus regulate conduct, not protected speech.\n\n           As   I   explained        in   Ayotte,    it   begs   reality   to\n\ncharacterize    these    laws   as   regulations     of   conduct.   Maine's\n\nstatute, like New Hampshire's, must be judged for what it is – a\n\n\n     36\n        Each statute operates slightly differently.        The New\nHampshire law imposes an outright prohibition on the sale or use of\nprescriber-identifiable data for marketing purposes.     N.H. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §§ 318:47-f, 318:47-g, 318-B:12(IV) (2006).      Maine's\nstatute imposes such a prohibition only for prescribers who choose\nto prevent their prescribing information from being used to market\nprescription drugs to them – the so-called \"opt-out\" approach. Me.\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1711-E(2-A). Vermont's law has an \"opt-\nin\" feature, prohibiting certain entities from selling or using\nprescriber-identifiable    data   for   marketing    or   promoting\nprescription drugs unless the prescriber consents. Vt. Stat. Ann.\ntit. 18, § 4631.\n     37\n        The Vermont statute limits the exchange of prescriber-\nidentifiable information among the same entities as the New\nHampshire and Maine provisions, but it also bars pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers and marketers from using the information for\nmarketing or promoting a prescription drug unless the prescriber\nconsents. See Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, § 4631(d).\n\n                                      -49-\n\frestriction on protected speech subject to the demands of the First\n\nAmendment.     That view has been validated by the Supreme Court's\n\nrecent decision in United States v. Stevens, 130 S. Ct. 1577\n\n(2010). See infra Section II.      However, as construed by the State,\n\nMaine's law also has a substantial ripple effect beyond Maine's\n\nborders that requires review under the dormant Commerce Clause. By\n\nshifting the statute's focus away from the activity considered\n\nharmful – the detailers' interactions with prescribers in Maine –\n\nto the earlier sales of the data, the Legislature in practical\n\neffect targeted transactions that occur primarily outside the\n\nState.\n\n          I agree with the majority that this out-of-state reach is\n\nnot fatal.    I write separately, however, to highlight the unusual\n\nrelationship    between   the   First   Amendment   and    Commerce     Clause\n\nissues.   Indeed, after examining the law's impact on interstate\n\ncommerce, I conclude that the First Amendment is the appropriate\n\nbattleground    for   constitutional    analysis    as    these   cases   move\n\nthrough the courts.\n\n             I. The First Amendment-Commerce Clause Dance\n\n          As a reflection of the analytic difficulties posed by New\n\nHampshire's    and    Maine's   laws    on   the   use,    sale   and     other\n\ndissemination of prescriber-identifiable data, their provisions are\n\nbaffling even to their proponents.             New Hampshire's Attorney\n\nGeneral asserted in Ayotte that the law should be construed to\n\n\n                                   -50-\n\fgovern only in-state transactions, see 550 F.3d at 63-64, an\n\ninterpretation that renders the statute largely irrelevant because\n\nthe transfers of data the statute purports to restrict occur almost\n\nentirely out-of-state.        Maine, by contrast, concedes that its\n\nsimilarly worded provision reaches out-of-state activity.                  At oral\n\nargument, however, when pressed about the statute's reach, the\n\nState's counsel asserted that section 1711-E(2-A) would cover the\n\npharmaceutical       detailers'   use   in   Maine       of    the     prescriber-\n\nidentifiable data – even though the law appears to have been\n\ndesigned precisely to avoid directly restricting the detailers'\n\nspeech to prescribers.\n\n           Counsel noted, for example, that \"use in Maine is what\n\nthe statute is directed at and that would be proscribed regardless\n\nof whether or not [an out-of-state] transaction before that was\n\nsubject   to   the    Act.\"   Counsel      also   stated       that,    \"[i]f   the\n\nassumption is that the transaction between IMS or one of the other\n\nplaintiffs and the drug companies occur[s] totally outside the\n\nState, then what the statute covers is the subsequent use in Maine\n\nby the detailer.\"       That explanation is at odds with my previous\n\nunderstanding of the State's construction of the statute, which\n\nexplicitly applies to \"a carrier, pharmacy or prescription drug\n\ninformation    intermediary\"      [\"PDII\"]    –    not        to   pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies and their employees.          That explanation is also at odds\n\nwith the district court's reading of the law.                  See Rowe, 532 F.\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\fSupp. 2d at 169 (\"The Law does not make illegal a drug company's\n\nuse of opt-out prescriber information for marketing purposes. . .\n\n.   The    Law   forbids   the   PDIIs   from   selling    opt-out   data   for\n\nmarketing, but it does not prohibit the pharmaceutical companies\n\nfrom using the data for marketing.\").38\n\n             Although the plaintiffs also state in their brief that\n\ndrug companies fall within the statute's definition of a PDII, that\n\nconstruction departs from plain language and ordinary usage.                 It\n\nmay be, as plaintiffs' counsel explained at oral argument, that a\n\ndrug manufacturer could be treated as a PDII when it transacts\n\ndirectly with pharmacies or other sources of prescription data. As\n\na general matter, however, drug companies are not PDIIs, and\n\nclassifying them as such when they are not acting in that capacity\n\nis not a defensible reading of the statute.               Thus, my assumption\n\nthroughout is that the statute does not directly regulate drug\n\nmanufacturers and their employees, including detailers, unless the\n\ndrug manufacturer acts as its own PDII.\n\n             The confusion over how the statutes operate arises from\n\nthe States' attempts to achieve indirectly its ultimate objective\n\n– limiting the content of the detailers' messages.             By restricting\n\nthe dissemination of prescriber-identifiable data rather than the\n\n\n      38\n        The majority in this case makes the same assumption:\n\"Section 1711-E(2-A) does not explicitly limit detailers' use of\nprescriber-identifying data, but the earlier stages of regulation\nare meant to prevent this information from getting to detailers for\nuse in marketing.\"\n\n                                     -52-\n\fdetailers' messages themselves, the States hoped their laws would\n\nbe evaluated as restrictions on conduct rather than speech.                 The\n\nFirst Amendment consequences of regulating the content of speech do\n\nnot disappear, however, simply because the regulation operates\n\nindirectly. See infra. In this instance, the indirection has only\n\nmade the constitutional inquiry more complex.\n\n            In   particular,    the    States'     approach   magnified     the\n\nCommerce    Clause   implications      of    the   legislation   because    the\n\ntargeted transfers of prescriber-identifiable data for marketing\n\npurposes occur primarily outside of both New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nEvidently    feeling   caught   in    a     constitutional    bind,   the   New\n\nHampshire Attorney General construed her state's statute to govern\n\nonly in-state transactions – effectively stripping the law of any\n\nimpact. Although Maine has rejected such a narrow construction, it\n\nis still scrambling to define the reach of its legislation.\n\n            In my view, the States should have confronted directly\n\nthe First Amendment challenges of what they sought to do.                 Their\n\nindirect approach has not avoided First Amendment scrutiny, yet\n\nthey have generated the Commerce Clause complications that we must\n\naddress here.     Those complications might have been avoided with\n\nmore straightforward laws addressing the States' concerns about\n\npharmaceutical detailing.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -53-\n\f                          II. The First Amendment\n\n            I recognize that the majority decision in Ayotte is\n\nbinding precedent for the proposition that the statute at issue\n\nhere, like the statute in Ayotte, regulates conduct, not speech.\n\nSee United States v. Rodríguez, 527 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(\"As a general rule, newly constituted panels in a multi-panel\n\ncircuit are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point.\").              I\n\nmust re-emphasize, however, my strong disagreement with the Ayotte\n\nmajority's conclusion that statutes such as those of New Hampshire\n\nand Maine regulate conduct, rather than constitutionally protected\n\nspeech.    The purpose of both laws is to restrict           truthful – but,\n\nin   the   States'    view,   undesirable   –   messages     communicated   by\n\npharmaceutical detailers to prescribing health care professionals.\n\nThe State of Maine admits that restricting such speech is precisely\n\nits objective.       Cf. Sorrell, 631 F. Supp. 2d at 446 (\"Plainly, the\n\nwhole   point   of    [Vermont's   statute]     is   to   control   detailers'\n\ncommercial message to prescribers.\").                The laws achieve this\n\npurpose by regulating the transfer of factual information.                  It\n\ncannot reasonably be argued that these laws, with this ultimate\n\npurpose, do not constitute restrictions on speech. See Ayotte, 550\n\nF.3d at 81-82 (Lipez, J., concurring and dissenting) (citing\n\ncases); Sorrell, 631 F. Supp. 2d at 446 (\"The mere fact that\n\n[Vermont's similar provision] regulates protected speech indirectly\n\ndoes not sweep it from the First Amendment's purview.\"); Laurence\n\n\n                                    -54-\n\fH.

In   making    that    comparison,   the   majority   repeatedly\n\ndiscounted the value of the expression that it acknowledged the New\n\nHampshire statute might regulate, describing such \"putative speech\"\n\nas \"items of nugatory informational value\" and \"of scant societal\n\nvalue.\"     Id. at 52.\n\n             However, in a recent decision considering a challenge to\n\na law criminalizing depictions of animal cruelty, the Supreme Court\n\nfirmly rejected the notion that the First Amendment's guarantee of\n\nfree speech \"extend[s] only to categories of speech that survive an\n\n\n                                      -55-\n\fad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.\"           Stevens,\n\n130 S. Ct. at 1585.       The Court explained that the exclusion of\n\ncategories of speech from the protection of the First Amendment has\n\noccurred only in \"special case[s].\"            Id. at 1586; id. at 1584\n\n(listing the \"few limited areas\" where \"the First Amendment has\n\npermitted restrictions upon the content of speech\" (quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted)).       Although observing that other categories\n\nof speech may yet be identified as unprotected based on historical\n\npractice, the Court stated that its prior decisions \"cannot be\n\ntaken as establishing a freewheeling authority to declare new\n\ncategories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.\"\n\nId. at 1586.\n\n              These prescriber-information cases involve the right to\n\ndisseminate truthful information – a classic form of protectible\n\nspeech activity, even when done for a fee – and the right to use\n\nthat information in crafting a marketing message. Stevens confirms\n\nthat   such    speech   may   not   be   excluded   from   First   Amendment\n\nprotection \"on the basis that [it] is not worth it,\" 130 S. Ct. at\n\n1585, and labeling speech as conduct does not make that exclusion\n\nany more permissible.\n\n              Hence, while Ayotte governs the First Amendment analysis\n\nin this case, I adhere to my view that what is at stake is\n\nprotectible speech, not conduct.            The relevant First Amendment\n\nquestion is thus whether Maine, like New Hampshire, has adequately\n\n\n                                     -56-\n\fjustified the limited restraint on commercial speech imposed by its\n\nstatute.      Here, as in Ayotte, I conclude that the State has done\n\nso.\n\n           Maine    asserts      three    \"compelling    state     interests\"   in\n\nsupport of section 1711-E(2-A): \"to improve public health, to limit\n\nannual increases in the cost of health care and to protect the\n\nprivacy of patients and prescribers\" in the State's health care\n\nsystem.    Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1711-E(1-B).                Although I\n\nagree that these interests are substantial in theory, I doubt that\n\nthe record supports the State's contention that the challenged\n\nstatute in fact advances all of them.            I am particularly skeptical\n\nof the privacy interest.\n\n           The     Maine   law     neither      prohibits    the    practice    of\n\npharmaceutical detailing nor prevents the widespread use of any\n\nprescriber's prescribing histories.             See Rowe, 532 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n170   (\"The     Attorney   General's        expert     [prescriber]    witnesses\n\nacknowledged     that   insurance        companies,    governmental    agencies,\n\nquality assurance committees, utilization reviewers, and others\n\nhave the right and responsibility to assess their prescribing\n\npatterns.\"); id. at 173 (\"[T]he new Law does not prevent the\n\npharmacies from transferring exactly the same information to the\n\nPDIIs, so long as the information is not ultimately used for\n\nmarketing.\").        Detailers      may     continue    to   devise    marketing\n\nstrategies based on the prescribing patterns of prescribers who do\n\n\n                                         -57-\n\fnot choose to bar the marketing use of their information, meaning\n\nthat the one-on-one meeting with a prescriber who has invoked the\n\nlaw's   protection    may    include      references     to    the    histories     of\n\ncolleagues within the same town or even the same practice.                    See id.\n\nat 171.\n\n           Given     the    wide,     permissible       dissemination         of   the\n\nprescribing information, and the continued allowance of targeted\n\none-on-one detailing, prescriber privacy does not appear to be\n\nmeaningfully advanced by this statute.              Accord Rowe, 532 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 173 (\"The Law only marginally advances the governmental\n\ninterest in prescriber privacy.\").              I therefore disagree with the\n\nmajority's analysis of the State's \"interest in preventing its\n\nprescribers from being subjected to unwanted solicitations by\n\ndetailers in Maine on the basis of their prescribing histories.\"\n\nThe statute does not protect a \"right to be let alone\"; it merely\n\nprotects prescribers who consent to interactions with detailers\n\nfrom exposure to one type of message.                The prescribers may have\n\nparticular    distaste      for     sales   pitches      based       on   their    own\n\nprescribing    histories,     but    that       discomfort    –     whether   or   not\n\nproperly labeled an issue of \"privacy\" – seems inadequate to\n\njustify a content-based restriction on truthful speech of public\n\nconcern.      See   Rowe,   532     F.    Supp.    2d   at    170    (\"Prescribers'\n\nprescribing patterns are . . . a matter of public concern.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                         -58-\n\f          In any event, the State's brief gives short shrift to\n\nboth the privacy and public health interests, and I find it\n\nunnecessary to closely examine the record on those two interests\n\nbecause the State's substantial interest in reducing health care\n\ncosts in Maine is sufficient to justify the statute within the\n\ncommercial speech framework.   Cf. Ayotte, 550 F.3d 88-96; Sorrell,\n\n631 F. Supp. 2d at 449-454 (finding that Vermont's statute advances\n\nthe State's interests in both cost containment and protecting\n\npublic health).   Relying on evidence similar to that introduced in\n\nAyotte, the State argues that detailing is \"significantly more\n\nsuccessful when detailers use prescriber-identifiable data,\" and\n\nthat reduced access to physicians' prescribing histories will\n\nreduce the likelihood that prescribers in Maine will prescribe\n\n\"unnecessary and more expensive brand-name drugs.\"      I will not\n\nrehearse in detail the nature of the evidence presented on this\n\nissue at the Maine legislative hearings or before the district\n\ncourt. It suffices to say that the record \"establishes a plausible\n\ncause-and-effect relationship between targeted detailing and higher\n\ndrug prices,\" Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 93, and that \"the Attorney\n\nGeneral has [thus] sufficiently demonstrated that the State's\n\ninterest in cost-containment would be furthered 'to a material\n\ndegree' by the limitation on speech it seeks to achieve through\n\n[section 1711-E(2-A)],\" id. at 94.\n\n\n\n\n                                -59-\n\f             To satisfy the First Amendment, the statute also must\n\nmeet the narrow tailoring prong of the Central Hudson inquiry. See\n\nCentral Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S.\n\n557, 566 (1980).         Without the benefit of our decision in Ayotte,\n\nthe district court concluded that the Maine law \"substantially\n\nfails\" the narrow tailoring requirement.                      Rowe, 532 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n176.    That judgment is wrong largely for the same reasons that it\n\nwas wrong in Ayotte.\n\n             In   concluding        that        the    law    is   more   extensive        than\n\nnecessary to serve the State's interest in decreasing the influence\n\nof drug company representatives, the district court emphasized that\n\nthe     State     did    not       address        the        concern      that        detailers\n\n\"inappropriately influenc[e] Maine prescribers by showering them\n\nwith gifts in implicit exchange for prescriptions.\"                          Id.        It also\n\npointed out that prescribers are \"[t]rained as professionals\" \"to\n\nperform a sophisticated and critical public health function.\"                               Id.\n\nat 177. It stated that these trained professionals \"have access to\n\na broad range of sources to evaluate whether to prescribe a drug\n\nfor a particular patient.\"                Id.    Therefore, the law unnecessarily\n\nprotects     them     \"from       being    influenced         by   their     own       practice\n\npatterns.\" Id. Specifically on the cost issue, the district court\n\nobserved that \"some branded drugs end up being more cost effective\n\nto     the   system     as    a    whole        than    their      generic       or     branded\n\ncounterparts.\"        Id. at 178.          In that sense, the court stated, the\n\n\n                                            -60-\n\fMaine law fails to \"discriminate between beneficial detailing and\n\nharmful detailing.\"           Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nThe court thus concluded that \"ban[ning] truthful information about\n\nopt-out prescribers' prescription patterns is to overreach and\n\nrestrict more speech than is necessary to address the problem of\n\nharmful detailing.\"       Id.\n\n            The district court's narrow tailoring assessment does not\n\nadequately    take     into    account    the    premise     from      which   it   must\n\nproceed, i.e., that the State has shown that restricting the use of\n\nprescriber-identifiable data advances at least one of its asserted\n\ninterests – controlling the spiraling cost of prescription drugs.\n\nThe court seems to assume that the alternatives it describes will\n\nbe just as effective in advancing that goal.\n\n            As I have explained, the State's evidence in both Ayotte\n\nand here supports the view that, despite the expertise of medical\n\nprofessionals,       detailers     are        able   to    influence      prescribing\n\ndecisions. I also explained in Ayotte why the State could properly\n\nconclude     that    alternative     methods         for    achieving      its      cost-\n\ncontainment objective that would not burden speech, including\n\nrestricting courtesy samples and other gifts, were not equivalent.\n\nAs I noted there, \"[t]he samples and gifts are merely a preparatory\n\nstep   in   the     marketing    process;       while     they   may    increase      the\n\nprescribers'      susceptibility         to    the   sales       pitch,    the      State\n\nreasonably concluded that it is the sales pitch itself that has the\n\n\n                                         -61-\n\fmost troubling effect on the prescribers' drug choice – and is most\n\nurgently in need of regulation.\"              550 F.3d at 99.39\n\n                The fact that detailing at times has beneficial effects\n\ndoes not undermine the State's conclusion that, on balance, its\n\nharms        outweigh   its    benefits   –   particularly   where   the   State\n\nreasonably could find that the benefits of the messages about\n\nprescription drugs that are disseminated by detailers are \"largely\n\nachievable in other ways.\"           550 F.3d at 95-9640; see also Rowe, 532\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 177.           Notably, the State's restriction on speech is\n\n\n\n        39\n       Moreover, Dr. Jerry Avorn, who also served as an expert in\nthis case, testified in Ayotte that other approaches had been tried\n\"nationally in terms of trying to restrict the freebies, trying to\nprovide doctors with other means of learning, requiring that\ndoctors take continuing ed courses,\" but that these strategies did\nnot eliminate \"this massive distortion of what doctors are\nprescribing and what the State, and its citizens, are paying for\ndrugs because of the very heavily and very effective promotional\nstrategies that are going on out there.\" 500 F.3d at 99.\n     40\n        I described in Ayotte some of the ways in which such\nmessages would continue to reach prescribers:\n\n     News reports, for example, would highlight truly\n     groundbreaking new therapies in a timely way and, indeed,\n     pharmaceutical detailers with knowledge of physicians'\n     medical specialties presumably would not need access to\n     prescribing histories to effectively promote such\n     innovations. Early adopters could be expected to respond\n     quickly with an interest in trying the new medications –\n     effectively   identifying   themselves   to   the   sales\n     representatives. In addition, . . . the statute does not\n     bar drug companies from alerting prescribers to newly\n     discovered problems with their medications.\n\n550 F.3d at 95 (footnotes omitted). Doctors also testified that\nthey learned about new drugs from medical literature, conferences,\nand colleagues. Id. at 95 n.64\n\n                                          -62-\n\fsignificantly more restrained than other marketing or advertising\n\nbans that have been considered by the Supreme Court.                   See Ayotte,\n\n550    F.3d    at    97   (citing   cases     involving   more    comprehensive\n\nrestrictions).        As I described in Ayotte, the private setting of\n\nthe targeted messages also is relevant to the narrow tailoring\n\ninquiry:\n\n              This case differs from those in which the\n              Court has rejected advertising bans that\n              restrict the exchange of ideas in the\n              \"commercial marketplace.\" The [Act] neither\n              \"protects\" the public from information about\n              drugs nor prevents truthful advocacy by\n              pharmaceutical representatives.   Instead, it\n              prevents sales representatives from crafting\n              personal marketing messages on the basis of\n              data that credible evidence indicates has been\n              used to unduly influence prescribing choices.\n              The Supreme Court on multiple occasions has\n              reviewed    regulation    of    such    direct\n              solicitations, upholding restrictions where\n              the context raised concerns about the impact\n              of the marketing on the recipient.\n\n550 F.3d at 100.\n\n              Indeed, the narrow tailoring element of the Central\n\nHudson test is arguably more easily satisfied here than in Ayotte\n\nbecause the statute bars the marketing use of prescribing histories\n\nonly for prescribers who affirmatively choose not to have their\n\ndata   used    for    marketing     purposes   –   narrowing     the    impact   on\n\nprotected speech.         Although the State's cost-containment objective\n\nwould have modest success, at best, if few Maine prescribers choose\n\nto restrict the use of their prescribing data, the restriction on\n\nprotected speech also would be modest in that situation.                  I see no\n\n                                       -63-\n\fconstitutional barrier to the State's judgment that restricting the\n\nuse of prescriber-identifiable data in the detailing messages of\n\nonly some of its prescribers would be beneficial.41\n\n          In sum, the considerations I addressed in Ayotte to\n\nevaluate \"'whether the extent of the restriction on protected\n\nspeech is in reasonable proportion to the interest served,'\" 550\n\nF.3d at 96 (quoting Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 767 (1993)),\n\napply here as well: \"[t]he inadequacy of alternatives to satisfy\n\nthe State's interests, the context of private communications, and\n\nthe limited impact on the message sought to be disseminated.\"   550\n\nF.3d at 98.   My review of these factors leads me to the same\n\nconclusion: the State \"has established a 'reasonable fit' between\n\nits abridgement of speech and its . . . goal.\"          Id. at 98\n\n(quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Sorell, 631 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 455 (finding the Vermont statute to be \"in reasonable\n\nproportion to the State's interests\").\n\n          Hence, like New Hampshire, Maine has met its burden to\n\njustify the limited restraint on commercial speech imposed by\n\nsection 1711-E(2-A).\n\n\n\n     41\n        The district court noted that, because the Maine statute\ngives prescribers the option to allow use of their information,\nthe   pharmaceutical  companies   might   provide  incentives   to\nprescribers in an attempt to persuade them not to opt out –\ncreating an even more troubling relationship between prescribers\nand drug manufacturers. Rowe, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 174 n.31; id. at\n176 n.35. In my view, such a scenario is too speculative to factor\ninto the analysis.\n\n                               -64-\n\f                             III. The Commerce Clause\n\n                This case confirms the view I expressed in Ayotte that\n\nthe plaintiffs' Commerce Clause challenge raised a serious issue\n\nthat should not have been addressed in that case on the basis of\n\nthe limited record and the parties' cursory briefing.                      Maine\n\ndistances itself from the nonsensical construction of the New\n\nHampshire statute that was advanced by the New Hampshire Attorney\n\nGeneral and accepted by the Ayotte majority,42 admitting that its\n\nstatute inevitably reaches out of state to regulate sales of data\n\nabout        prescriptions   written   in   Maine.     Indeed,    the   activity\n\nrestricted by the Maine statute, logically construed, occurs almost\n\nentirely beyond the State's borders.43\n\nA. The Activities Regulated by the Statute\n\n                Understanding    the   sequence   of   events    implicated   by\n\nsection 1711-E(2-A) is crucial to understanding the statute's legal\n\nstatus.        To begin with the end, the statute is designed to prevent\n\npharmaceutical detailers working in Maine from using information\n\n\n\n     42\n       The New Hampshire Attorney General urged the court to read\nthe act to \"'relate only to activity that takes place\ndomestically,'\" and the panel majority adopted that view despite\nrecognizing that, so construed, the law \"may not accomplish very\nmuch.\" Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 63, 64.\n        43\n         Although the Attorney General at oral argument attempted\nto avoid committing to any specific extraterritorial reach for the\nstatute, I agree with the majority that \"[t]he text of the statute\nby its terms shows section 1711-E(2-A) was intended to apply to\nplaintiffs' out of state use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers'\nidentifying data.\"\n\n                                       -65-\n\fabout the prescribing habits of Maine prescribers to present\n\ntargeted, and therefore more persuasive, sales pitches to those\n\nprescribers.        The    statute     does    not,   however,      regulate   the\n\ndetailers' interactions with the prescribers.                Instead, the State\n\nseeks to achieve its objective indirectly by, in effect, placing a\n\nred flag on information about prescriptions written by Maine\n\nprescribers who opt into the statute's protection. The red-flagged\n\ninformation may not be used, sold or transferred \"for any marketing\n\npurpose\" by pharmacies, insurers and other entities that acquire it\n\nin the course of their business.44\n\n          In practical effect, that prohibition rarely limits any\n\ncommercial transactions in Maine.             This is so because local Maine\n\npharmacies     routinely       transfer   their    prescription      information\n\nelectronically to their out-of-state headquarters.45                 Although the\n\nred flag is attached to the information when those transfers are\n\nmade, the statutory prohibition does not affect this first movement\n\nof the data because it is not \"for any marketing purpose.\"                     Most\n\nprescriber-identifiable data leaves the State in this permissible\n\nmanner.      The   data   is    next   transferred    from    the    out-of-state\n\n\n     44\n        The statute also prohibits licensing or exchanging the\ninformation for value. For the sake of simplicity, I will refer\nprimarily to the prohibitions on the sale or transfer of the data.\n     45\n       The record indicates that, other than the data from one\nsmall supplier in Maine, the prescriber-identifiable information\nobtained by the plaintiffs is transferred in the ordinary course of\nbusiness from retail stores located in Maine to the pharmacy\nchains' out-of-state headquarters.\n\n                                       -66-\n\fpharmacy headquarters to the data mining companies – the plaintiffs\n\nin this case – who also are located outside of Maine.46                  The red\n\nflag    imposes    a    significant   restriction     on   those   out-of-state\n\ntransactions.      Although data miners use prescription information\n\nfor other reasons, including to generate reports for government and\n\nother nonprofit recipients, the most lucrative aspect of their\n\nbusiness is to aggregate the information into reports that can be\n\nsold to pharmaceutical companies for use in marketing.47\n\n             Hence, the pharmacies and data miners, although not\n\nthemselves using the prescriber-identifiable data to market drugs,\n\npresumably must impose a contractual obligation on their customers\n\nnot to use the information for that purpose in order to fulfill\n\ntheir obligations under section 1711-E(2-A).                 See Rowe, 532 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 169 n.18 (\"[T]he PDIIs are assigned the responsibility\n\nto   limit   the       pharmaceutical    companies'    use   of    the   opt-out\n\nprescriber data.\").        How the State would enforce the statute if a\n\npharmaceutical manufacturer does not abide by such a contract with\n\n\n\n       46\n         An IMS senior vice president testified that the company\ncontracts with Rite Aid at its headquarters in Pennsylvania and\nwith CVS at its headquarters in Rhode Island.   IMS is based in\nPlymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania.\n       47\n       Drug companies also have non-marketing uses for prescriber-\nidentified data, including determining the need for new drugs and\nimplementing prescription recall programs. Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 74\nn.29. Still, at oral argument, plaintiffs' counsel stated that\n\"[n]inety-five percent of what we do in selling to a pharmaceutical\nmanufacturer is so that it can use the information for marketing\nand detail.\"\n\n                                        -67-\n\fa data miner is unclear.    Perhaps the data miners would be deemed\n\nliable for failing to enforce the obligation unless they took\n\naction against the offending drug company; such action might\n\ninclude a refusal to continue selling the information to the\n\ncompany.48\n\n             Whatever the specific mechanism for enforcement of the\n\nstatute's prohibition, the statute's objective is to prevent the\n\nuse of any prescriber-identifiable data obtained by the drug\n\ncompanies in sales pitches by the detailers in Maine who are the\n\nstatute's real target.49   As my description of the process reveals,\n\nhowever, achieving that objective involves raising the red flag in\n\ntransactions that almost all occur beyond Maine's borders.   Nearly\n\nall of the transfers between the information possessors – the\n\n\n     48\n       The district court described the \"burden on pharmacies and\nPDIIs to police their customers\" as follows:\n\n     They can still sell the opt-out information, but they\n     cannot do so if their customers, the pharmaceutical\n     companies, are going to use the information for a purpose\n     that the Law prohibits. If the PDIIs successfully police\n     their contracts with the pharmaceutical companies, as the\n     Law contemplates, the pharmaceutical companies will not\n     be able to include opt-out prescriber information in\n     marketing their products. If they do not, then they, not\n     the pharmaceutical companies, are subject to sanction.\n\n532 F. Supp. 2d at 169.\n     49\n        The State argues that the record contains no evidence about\nthe transactions between the plaintiff data miners and the drug\nmanufacturers. IMS, however, asserts in its brief that none of its\nsubscribers are located in Maine, and it cites the testimony of\nHossam Sadek, a senior vice president of the company, who stated\nthat he knew of no IMS customers in the State.\n\n                                 -68-\n\fpharmacies and data miners – and the information recipients – the\n\ndata miners and pharmaceutical companies – are made out of state.\n\nSo too are any contractual promises by the recipients to abide by\n\nthe statute's limitation.\n\n           The       plaintiffs        complain     that     this      significant\n\nextraterritorial effect is impermissible under the dormant Commerce\n\nClause.   The State, however, maintains that the statute has only a\n\n\"spillover effect\" beyond its borders, and it argues that the law\n\napplies only to \"entities either located in Maine or having nexus\n\nwith Maine,\" i.e., those sufficiently connected to the State to\n\nmeet the requirements for personal jurisdiction. The State asserts\n\nthat it is \"irrelevant\" that the main computers of the large retail\n\npharmacy chains are located outside Maine because Maine is the\n\nsource    of   the    restricted        information,       and   the    electronic\n\nprescription data is initially entered into in-state computers.\n\nThe State further emphasizes that the prescriptions are written by\n\nprescribers licensed by Maine and filled almost exclusively by\n\nState-licensed pharmacies, giving Maine a substantial interest in\n\ngoverning the dissemination and use of the prescription data.\n\n           The   difficulty       of   evaluating    the    parties'    competing\n\ndepictions of section 1711-E(2-A) begins with the choice of an\n\nappropriate framework for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -69-\n\fB. Identifying the Correct Analytical Approach\n\n           The Supreme Court has articulated various \"protocol[s]\n\nfor dormant Commerce Clause analysis,\" Dep't of Revenue of Ky. v.\n\nDavis, 553 U.S. 328, 338 (2008), none of which seems fully apt\n\nhere. This is plainly not an instance of discriminatory purpose or\n\ntreatment in which the statute should be deemed per se invalid\n\nbecause it favors in-state over out-of-state interests. See, e.g.,\n\nAlliance of Auto. Mfrs. v. Gwadowsky, 430 F.3d 30, 35-36 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (noting that the \"core purpose\" of the dormant Commerce\n\nClause is \"to prevent states and their political subdivisions from\n\npromulgating protectionist policies\" (quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted)).   The law imposes the same burden on every competitor,\n\nand out-of-state entities would gain no advantage by relocating to\n\nMaine.50\n\n           Plaintiffs, unsurprisingly, have relied primarily on the\n\nextraterritoriality doctrine, and the proposition that a statute\n\nmay be deemed per se invalid if it \"directly controls commerce\n\noccurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State.\" Healy v. Beer\n\nInst., Inc. 491 U.S. 324, 336 (1989); see also Wine & Spirits\n\n\n\n     50\n       Price controls that favor in-state businesses, assessments\nthat function as protective tariffs, and regulations that cap in-\nstate prices for goods produced out of state are classic examples\nof measures that run afoul of this aspect of the dormant Commerce\nClause. See, e.g., Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Walsh, 538\nU.S. 644, 669-70 (2003); Or. Waste Sys., Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl.\nQuality, 511 U.S. 93, 99 (1994); Healy v. Beer Inst., Inc., 491\nU.S. 324, 336 (1989).\n\n                               -70-\n\fRetailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island [\"Wine & Spirits II\"], 481 F.3d 1,\n\n15 (1st Cir. 2007); Pharm.

Such\n\nlaws may subject activities to more than one state's regulations,\n\nleading to the possibility of conflicting obligations.       See, e.g.,\n\nHealy, 491 U.S. at 336-37; CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of Am., 481\n\nU.S. 69, 88-89 (1987); Peter C. Felmly, Comment, Beyond the Reach\n\nof States: The Dormant Commerce Clause, Extraterritorial State\n\nRegulation, and the Concerns of Federalism, 55 Me. L. Rev. 467, 509\n\n(2003) (observing that the extraterritoriality \"principle ensures\n\nthat a state will not overstep its bounds and unreasonably trample\n\nupon the authority of another sovereign\").      Plaintiffs also invoke\n\nthe so-called Pike balancing test, which is applied to laws that\n\nregulate   evenhandedly   and   have   only   \"incidental\"   effects   on\n\ninterstate commerce. See Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137,\n\n142 (1970);51 see also United Haulers Ass'n, Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer\n\nSolid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 550 U.S. 330, 346 (2007).52\n\n\n\n     51\n        The Court in Pike held that, when a statute regulates\nevenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local purpose, and has only\nincidental effects on interstate commerce, \"it will be upheld\nunless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in\nrelation to the putative local benefits.\" 397 U.S. at 142.\n     52\n       I disagree with the majority's assertion that the plaintiffs\nhave waived any Pike balancing argument. Given the similarity of\nthe inquiries under the different strands of the dormant Commerce\nClause, I see no reason to disregard the argument here.\n\n                                 -71-\n\f            Neither of these latter alternatives is a good fit for\n\nthe present circumstances. The per se extraterritoriality analysis\n\nmay appear literally applicable, given that the statute's red flag\n\nhas a direct impact almost exclusively on out-of-state commerce.\n\nYet, as I observed in Ayotte, \"whether extraterritoriality is\n\nimpermissible in every instance, or whether it transgresses the\n\ndormant    Commerce   Clause   only    when   the   challenged   statute    is\n\ndiscriminatory or protectionist in nature, appears to be [a]\n\nrelevant consideration.\" 550 F.3d at 105 (citing Felmly, supra, at\n\n491).     The Maine law does not by its terms impose restraints on\n\nnon-domestic businesses, and the imbalance between in-state and\n\nout-of-state effect is a matter of happenstance not design.                The\n\nstatute does not seek to achieve conformity between in-state and\n\nout-of-state commerce.53 Additionally, there is no risk of conflict\n\n\n     53\n        The pursuit of such consistency is a feature of the most\nprominent Supreme Court extraterritoriality precedents. In Healy,\n491 U.S. at 335, the challenged Connecticut statute expressly\nrequired out-of-state shippers to affirm that their Connecticut\nprices were no higher than the prices being charged in bordering\nstates, and the New York statute at issue in Brown-Forman\nDistillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U.S. 573,\n579 (1986), required liquor producers and distillers doing business\nin the State to affirm comparable in-state and out-of-state\npricing. In Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511 (1935),\nthe Court struck down the New York Milk Control Act, which\nprescribed minimum prices for milk that had the effect of setting\nout-of-state milk prices. Id. at 524. In line with those cases,\nthe Seventh Circuit recently struck down an Indiana law that\nsubjected out-of-state loans entered into by Indiana residents to\nthe requirements of Indiana's consumer law if the out-of-state\ncreditor had advertised or solicited sales in Indiana. Midwest\nTitle Loans, Inc. v. Mills, 593 F.3d 660, 662, 667-68 (7th Cir.\n2010).\n\n                                      -72-\n\fwith other states' regimes.      No other State has a stake in the use\n\nof prescriber-identifiable data in Maine or any obvious interest in\n\nthe use of Maine prescriber information in their own locales.\n\n           Indeed, it is arguable that, despite the statute's impact\n\non commercial transactions that occur almost entirely out of state,\n\nthe   commerce   it   controls   is   not   \"wholly   outside   [Maine's]\n\nboundaries.\"     Healy, 491 U.S. at 336.     The subject matter of the\n\nlaw is data that both originates in Maine and is intended for\n\nmarketing use in Maine.    Maine's aim is to regulate on a matter of\n\npublic welfare only within Maine. Cf. Midwest Title Loans, Inc. v.\n\nMills, 593 F.3d 660, 667-68 (7th Cir. 2010) (invalidating Indiana\n\nstatute that sought to protect Indiana residents from predatory\n\nlending practices by businesses located in other states).         On the\n\nother hand, it is difficult to characterize the statute's effect on\n\nout-of-state commerce as \"incidental\" when its prohibition in fact\n\nhas its primary impact outside the State.        See, e.g., Healy, 491\n\nU.S. at 336 (\"The critical inquiry is whether the practical effect\n\nof the regulation is to control conduct beyond the boundaries of\n\nthe State.\").\n\n           The various labels ordinarily are invoked because they\n\nare associated with different levels of scrutiny. We have observed\n\nthat a statute that regulates evenhandedly \"engenders a lower level\n\nof scrutiny,\" Wine and Spirits II, 481 U.S. at 11 (quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted), while \"[a] statute is per se invalid if it\n\n\n                                  -73-\n\fregulates commerce wholly outside the state's borders,\" id. at 15.\n\nIdentifying the appropriate label should not distract us, however,\n\nor bog us down at the threshold of analysis.     Despite the different\n\nprotocols for dormant Commerce Clause inquiry, the Supreme Court\n\nhas observed that \"there is no clear line separating\" the various\n\ntypes   of    state   regulation    and   that   the   same   \"critical\n\nconsideration\" applies to each category: \"the overall effect of the\n\nstatute on both local and interstate activity.\"           Brown-Forman\n\nDistillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth., 476 U.S. 573, 579\n\n(1986) (referring to regulations that are \"virtually per se invalid\n\nunder the Commerce Clause, and the category subject to the Pike v.\n\nBruce Church balancing approach\"); see also Healy, 491 U.S. at 337\n\nn.14 (noting the same \"critical consideration\" in determining\n\n\"whether the extraterritorial reach of a statute violates the\n\nCommerce Clause\"); Am. Booksellers Found. v. Dean, 342 F.3d 96, 102\n\n(2d Cir. 2003).\n\n             This dual concern is an inevitable byproduct of our\n\nsystem of federalism.    The Court has often remarked in its dormant\n\nCommerce Clause cases that States \"retain authority under their\n\ngeneral police powers to regulate matters of legitimate local\n\nconcern, even though interstate commerce may be affected.\"       Maine\n\nv. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 138 (1986) (quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted); see also, e.g., Davis, 553 U.S. at 338; cf. Garcia v. San\n\nAntonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 546 (1985).       Hence, in\n\n\n                                   -74-\n\freviewing a statute challenged under the dormant Commerce Clause,\n\nwe are always guided by \"the Constitution's special concern both\n\nwith the maintenance of a national economic union unfettered by\n\nstate-imposed limitations on interstate commerce and with the\n\nautonomy of the individual States within their respective spheres.\"\n\nHealy, 491 U.S. at 335-36 (footnote omitted).\n\n             Indeed, even the \"rigorous form of review\" applicable to\n\ndiscriminatory legislation allows exemption for a statute that\n\n\"furthers a legitimate local objective that cannot be served by\n\nreasonable non-discriminatory means.\"               Wine and Spirits II, 481\n\nF.3d at 11.      Local needs also must qualify the \"near-fatal rule of\n\nper se invalidity\" for statutes that regulate extraterritorially.\n\nSee Felmy, supra, at 492; id. at 488 (observing that \"[o]ne may\n\ninfer\" from language in CTS Corp., 481 U.S. at 93, that \"where a\n\nstate has a significant interest in regulating a particular aspect\n\nof   interstate     commerce,     it   may    do    so,    regardless     of     the\n\nextraterritorial effect of the legislation, if the regulation also\n\naffects a substantial number of in-state residents\").\n\n            I thus see the most relevant and appropriate question as\n\nsimply    whether   Maine's     interests     are   sufficiently       weighty   to\n\njustify    any   burdens   its   law    imposes     on    interstate    commerce.\n\nWhatever the label and however we describe the level of scrutiny,\n\nthe outcome here is the same.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -75-\n\fC. Assessing the Local Interest and the Burden on Interstate\nCommerce\n\n               As discussed in Section II above, I agree that the State\n\nhas a substantial interest in reducing the cost of prescription\n\ndrugs    for    its    residents    and    that   the    State    could    reasonably\n\nconclude       that    section   1711-E(2-A)      advances       that    interest    by\n\nregulating       the    dissemination       of    information       revealing       the\n\nprescribing histories of Maine's licensed health care providers.\n\nCf. Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 94-95.              The statute's importance to the\n\nState is no different in the context of a Commerce Clause inquiry\n\nthan in the First Amendment setting.\n\n               The other side of the balance is not the same, however.\n\nThe conclusion that the statute is \"narrowly tailored\" under the\n\nCentral Hudson test for commercial speech, see 447 U.S. at 566,\n\ndoes not tell us whether the provision impermissibly burdens\n\ninterstate commerce. As I have described, the statute does in fact\n\nregulate specific activities that occur mostly out of state.                        The\n\nimpact    on    the    plaintiffs     is    not   merely       \"spillover\"    from   a\n\nprohibition directed at others; they are among the categories of\n\nentities – PDIIs – affected directly by the statute.\n\n               Moreover, the statute's impact on PDIIs is potentially\n\nenormous. Sales of prescriber-identifiable data are the bread-and-\n\nbutter of the medical data mining business, producing $1.75 billion\n\nin revenue for plaintiff IMS Health alone in 2005.                      Although only\n\nthree    states       have   thus   far    enacted      laws    designed    to   limit\n\n                                          -76-\n\fdetailers' access to prescribers' identifying information, they are\n\nat the front of a wave of similar legislation.                See Rowe, 532 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 180 n.41 (noting testimony that seventeen to twenty\n\nother states were considering similar laws); Heesters, supra, at\n\n791    (stating   that   \"numerous    other    states       have   [bills]      that\n\nsimilarly restrict the sale of prescription drug data that are\n\ncurrently pending in legislative committees\").\n\n              Hence, a conclusion that section 1711-E(2-A) comports\n\nwith    the   dormant    Commerce    Clause    could    eventually       lead    to\n\nelimination of any market for prescriber-identifiable data, which\n\nthe plaintiffs have argued would jeopardize the viability of their\n\nbusinesses.     See Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 95 n.66 (\"Plaintiffs theorize\n\nthat    the   pharmaceutical   companies      would    be    unwilling    to    pay\n\nsubstantial sums for information they cannot use in marketing,\n\neliminating the data miners' biggest customers – thereby cutting\n\noff the commercial funding that subsidizes the research and other\n\nnon-commercial uses of the data.\").54          Plaintiff IMS asserts that\n\nit will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for it to adjust its\n\nsystems to comply with the statute's restrictions; plaintiff Source\n\nHealthcare estimated that it would spend 10,000 employee hours to\n\ncomply with Maine's and Vermont's laws.\n\n\n       54\n       The fact that only 259 of Maine's 7,500 prescribers opted\ninto the statute's confidentiality protection during the period in\nwhich it has been suspended by the preliminary injunction tells us\nlittle about the law's likely impact. More activity presumably\nwill occur once the injunction is lifted.\n\n                                     -77-\n\f           The \"possible effects on the profits of the individual\n\nmanufacturers\" is not, however, the concern of the dormant Commerce\n\nClause.   PhRMA, 249 F.3d at 84.      Our court previously has observed\n\nthat \"the Commerce Clause . . . 'protects the interstate market,\n\nnot particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome\n\nregulations.'\"   Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n v. Rowe, 429 F.3d 294, 313\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Exxon Corp. v. Gov. of Md., 437 U.S. 117,\n\n127-28 (1978)); see also PhRMA, 249 F.3d at 84 (\"[T]he fact that a\n\nlaw may have devastating economic consequences on a particular\n\ninterstate firm is not sufficient to rise to a Commerce Clause\n\nburden.\" (quotation marks and citations omitted)).                Even if the\n\nstatute meant the demise of the data-mining industry as a whole –\n\nan outcome I doubt, see infra note 22 – any ill-effects from that\n\nresult would \"relate[] to the wisdom of the statute, not to its\n\nburden on commerce.\"    Exxon Corp., 437 U.S. at 128.         The point is\n\nperhaps more easily understood in a different context.                If, for\n\nexample, every state decided to ban the use of firecrackers because\n\nof the risk of injury, the dormant Commerce Clause would not trump\n\nthe legislative safety concerns and insulate the fireworks industry\n\nfrom extinction.\n\n           Neither   national      uniformity    nor   any   of    the    other\n\ntraditional concerns underlying the dormant Commerce Clause are\n\nimplicated   here.     The   law   does    not   \"erect   barriers       against\n\ninterstate trade,\" Lewis v. BT. Inv. Managers, Inc., 447 U.S. 27,\n\n\n                                    -78-\n\f35 (1980), and its target is not \"interstate commerce\" as such.\n\nRather, the transactions governed by the statute are restricted\n\nonly because they are subsidiary steps in the regulation of in-\n\nstate activity.55 Indeed, the law's effect on individual businesses\n\nwould be no different if every PDII were based in Maine.                   Nor does\n\nMaine's      decision    to   restrict    the   use    of   certain     prescriber-\n\nidentifiable data make similar legislation more or less appropriate\n\nor necessary in other states.            There is nothing in Maine's statute\n\nthat affects other states' choices about whether, or how, to\n\nregulate prescriber-identifiable data within their own borders. As\n\nthe    Supreme   Court    observed   in    Exxon      Corp.,   \"[t]he    evil   that\n\nappellants perceive in this litigation is not that the several\n\nStates will enact differing regulations, but rather that they will\n\nall conclude that [similar] provisions are warranted.\" 437 U.S. at\n\n128.        However, \"[i]n the absence of a relevant congressional\n\ndeclaration of policy, or a showing of a specific discrimination\n\nagainst, or burdening of, interstate commerce, we cannot conclude\n\nthat the States are without power to regulate in this area.\"                    Id.\n\nat 128-29.\n\n\n\n\n       55\n        The \"subsidiary\" nature of the out-of-state transactions is,\nof course, a function of the statute's purpose to restrict speech\nin Maine. Although that in-state speech objective strengthens the\nState's Commerce Clause position, the indirect regulatory strategy\n– as I have explained – creates the First Amendment-Commerce Clause\ndance and unnecessarily complicates the constitutional analysis.\n\n\n                                         -79-\n\f           Nor do I see a way in which Maine could have promoted its\n\ninterest   \"'with   a   lesser   impact   on   interstate   activities,'\"\n\nMinnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. 456, 471 (1981)\n\n(quoting Pike, 397 U.S. at 142) – a factor that is considered in\n\nPike balancing.     See, e.g., U & I Sanitation v. Columbus, 205 F.3d\n\n1063, 1070-71 (8th Cir. 2000).       If Maine had regulated only in-\n\nstate activity – directly barring detailers working in Maine from\n\nusing the opted-out prescribers' data in their sales pitches – the\n\nimpact on data miners would be the same.          In such a regime, the\n\nout-of-state data miners would not be prohibited from selling the\n\nprescriber-identifiable     data   for    marketing   purposes,   but   the\n\npharmaceutical companies would have no reason to buy it.56\n\n           In sum, I conclude that section 1711-E(2-A) survives\n\ndormant Commerce Clause scrutiny even though in practical effect it\n\nregulates activity that occurs primarily beyond Maine's borders.\n\n\n\n     56\n        The actual impact on the plaintiffs of legislation\nregulating the use of prescriber-identifiable data remains to be\nseen. As the district court noted, the law \"does not prevent the\npharmaceutical companies from marketing their products and the\ncompanies may resort to more general, less tailored marketing.\"\nRowe, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 174. It thus may be that the demand for\naggregated data about prescribing trends will change, but not dry\nup. For example, the statute appears to permit detailers to use\naggregated data based on specialities or zip codes. See Ayotte,\n550 F.3d at 95 n.66. Moreover, if empirical data gathered in the\nfuture on the statute's impact shows that less particularized, less\nefficient detailing is negating the cost savings Maine hopes to\nachieve, the State may be persuaded to change its approach to the\nproblem. Cf. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. at 473 n.17 (\"The\nexistence of major in-state interests adversely affected by [a law]\nis a powerful safeguard against legislative abuse.\").\n\n                                   -80-\n\fThe burden on interstate commerce (the reduction in the value of a\n\nparticular type of business) is not the kind of burden that raises\n\nconstitutional concerns.       To the extent that burden is relevant to\n\nthe Commerce Clause analysis, it is easily outweighed by the\n\nState's substantial interest in bringing the cost of prescription\n\ndrugs – and health care expenses in general – under control.            Cf.\n\nPharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n, 429 F.3d at 312 (describing a law aimed at\n\n\"reduc[ing] the costs of, and increas[ing] the public's access to,\n\nprescription drugs\" as \"designed to deal with 'one of the serious\n\nproblems of our time'\").\n\n           I therefore agree that the judgment of the district court\n\nshould be reversed.\n\n                   IV. The Focus of Future Litigation\n\n           This case has allowed us to put to rest the Commerce\n\nClause challenge that was not properly teed up in Ayotte.                 In\n\naddition, in the period between our reviews of New Hampshire's and\n\nMaine's similar statutes, Stevens has reinforced my view that laws\n\nregulating   the    messages   of   pharmaceutical    detailers     restrict\n\nprotectible speech, not conduct.           Thus, as more of these cases\n\nevolve   across    the   country,   the    legal   argument   and    factual\n\ndevelopment should be framed by the Supreme Court's commercial\n\nspeech doctrine under the First Amendment.\n\n           That doctrine is the subject of ongoing debate among\n\ncommentators and in the courts, including within the Supreme Court.\n\n\n                                    -81-\n\fMuch of the ferment focuses on the narrow tailoring prong of the\n\nCentral Hudson inquiry and how close the fit must be in any\n\ncommercial   speech     case      between       the    State's     interest     and    the\n\nchallenged restriction on speech.

Tribe, supra\n\n(\"Even if the prescription restraint laws were subject to the more\n\nforgiving standard applicable to regulations of purely commercial\n\nspeech, however, they would still be unconstitutional because they\n\nviolate the core principle that the government may not restrict\n\neven commercial communication merely to block the dissemination of\n\ntruth.\").

Supp. 2d at 447-48,57 the\n\ncontrary view has worthy proponents and undoubtedly deserves close\n\nconsideration.\n\n            Yet another source of difficulty is the quality of the\n\nrecord a state legislature must amass to prove that a statute\n\nadvances its interest and extends no more broadly than necessary to\n\nachieve its objectives.    I concluded in Ayotte that the district\n\ncourt had held the Attorney General to an overly demanding standard\n\n\n     57\n        The district court in Sorrell observed that, \"[b]y\ndefinition, the 'Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine . . .\ncreates a category of speech defined by content but afforded only\nqualified protection.'\" 631 F.

Here, too, the court underestimated the strength of the\n\nState's showing.    As I explained in Ayotte, a state legislature's\n\ninvestigation cannot reasonably be expected to match the exhaustive\n\ninvestigation Congress conducts in connection with complex federal\n\nlegislation.     See 550 F.3d at 92-93 (referring to the \"'tens of\n\nthousands of pages' of materials\" acquired during three years of\n\nCongressional    hearings    on    provisions    of   the   Cable   Television\n\nConsumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992).\n\n            Although the extent of the required proof may differ, the\n\nquestion in both federal and state contexts is the same: \"whether\n\nthe government is able to support its restriction on speech by\n\n'adduc[ing] either empirical support or at least sound reasoning on\n\nbehalf of its measure[].'\"        Id. at 93 (quoting    Turner Broad.

Supp. 2d 163, 177 n.12\n\n(D.N.H. 2007)).58     Yet the court also cited the Supreme Court's\n\nstatement in Turner Broadcasting that \"the 'obligation to exercise\n\nindependent judgment when First Amendment rights are implicated is\n\nnot a license to reweigh the evidence de novo, or to replace\n\n[legislative] factual predictions with our own.'\"              Id. at 178-79.\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court has \"permitted litigants to justify\n\nspeech    restrictions    by    reference       to   studies   and    anecdotes\n\npertaining to different locales altogether, or even, in a case\n\napplying strict scrutiny, to justify restrictions based solely on\n\nhistory, consensus, and 'simple common sense.'\"                Florida Bar v.\n\nWent For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 628 (1995) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n     58\n       The district court in Vermont also was faced with competing\narguments about \"the nature and amount of deference\" that should be\nafforded to \"the predictive judgments and factual findings of the\nLegislature.\" Sorrell, 631 F.

Given the novelty of their statutes, neither\n\nState   could      offer      \"empirical    data    showing   the   extent      of   the\n\ninfluence     of     prescriber-specific           information      on   physicians'\n\ndecision-making\"         or    proving     the    cost-cutting   impact    of    their\n\nprovisions.        550 F.3d at 93.               Both States, however, adduced\n\nevidence    of     the   impact     of    detailing    generally     and   presented\n\nanecdotal evidence \"strongly indicating that sales pitches based on\n\nspecific prescribing patterns have a particularly persuasive impact\n\non drug choice.\"           Id. at 94; Rowe, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 172.                  New\n\nHampshire offered expert evidence in defense of its view that\n\nalternative      strategies,       less    burdensome    on   speech,      would     not\n\nsuffice.     Ayotte, 550 F.2d at 100.               At this point in time, such\n\nevidence was sufficient in each case to \"establish[] a factual\n\nbasis justifying the initiative.\"                Id. at 94.   Equivalent evidence\n\nmay not be enough to support the adoption of similar legislation in\n\nother states, however, if more extensive quantifiable data becomes\n\navailable.       Cf. Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 93-94 (\"[I]t will be important\n\ngoing forward for the State to try to measure the cost-containment\n\neffect of its initiative, and it is possible that this ongoing\n\nassessment will indicate that the measure is not as effective as\n\nthe State had hoped.\").\n\n            Without a doubt, the States must have flexibility to\n\nexperiment with measures that will help them address the serious\n\n\n                                           -86-\n\fproblem of spiraling drug costs. At the same time, the restriction\n\nof speech based on its content is a serious constitutional matter.\n\nThe tension between those principles in laws such as those enacted\n\nin New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont presents a challenge to the\n\nSupreme Court's commercial speech jurisprudence that warrants the\n\nCourt's attention and guidance.\n\n\n\n\n                              -87-\n\f",

This case involves constitutional\n\nchallenges to a Maine statute enacted to reduce health care costs\n\nand protect prescribers' data privacy.                        In Maine and elsewhere,\n\neach    time    a    prescription        from     a    physician      or    other    licensed\n\nprescriber is given to a pharmacy, the pharmacy obtains a number of\n\nfacts    that       identify     the    prescriber.           Data    put   together    from\n\nmultiple transactions involving the same prescriber reveal certain\n\npatterns and preferences, including her prescribing history, her\n\nchoice    of     particular           brand-name      drugs    versus       their    generic\n\nequivalents, and the likelihood she will adopt new brand-name\n\ndrugs.\n\n               Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of 22 Me. Rev.\n\nStat.    Ann.       tit.   22,    §    1711-E(2-A),       which       allows      prescribers\n\nlicensed       in    Maine     to      choose    not     to    make    this       identifying\n\ninformation available for use in marketing prescription drugs to\n\nthem. Section 1711-E(2-A) does not directly prohibit any marketing\n\npractices.       Rather, it prohibits certain entities from licensing,\n\nusing, selling, transferring, or exchanging this information for a\n\nmarketing purpose if the prescriber has opted to protect the\n\nconfidentiality of her prescribing data.                      Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n22, § 1711-E(2-A).\n\n               Plaintiffs,       companies        that    collect       vast      amounts   of\n\nidentifying data about individual prescribers and aggregate the\n\ndata     into       reports      and     databases       for     use       when     marketing\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fpharmaceutical products, are covered in the text of the law, as are\n\nothers.

Immediately after section\n\n1711-E(2-A)'s      enactment     in    2008,   and     before      its    enforcement,\n\nplaintiffs sued Maine's attorney general in the federal district\n\ncourt of Maine under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that section 1711-\n\nE(2-A)'s restrictions on the licensing, use, sale, transfer, or\n\nexchange of Maine prescribers' identifying data for a marketing\n\npurpose are unconstitutional limitations on protected speech under\n\nthe First Amendment; that these restrictions are unconstitutionally\n\nvague and overbroad under the First and Fourteenth Amendments; and\n\nthat the law also regulates transactions outside of Maine in\n\nviolation of the dormant Commerce Clause.                   On December 21, 2007,\n\nthe district court granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction and\n\nprohibited Maine from enforcing section 1711-E(2-A) on the basis of\n\nplaintiffs' First Amendment claims.

In the meantime, the district court's injunction has\n\nremained   in    effect     during   this    appeal,     and    Maine   has   never\n\nimplemented section 1711-E(2-A).\n\n              We reject all of plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to\n\nsection 1711-E(2-A).        Plaintiffs' First Amendment challenges fail\n\nfor the reasons stated in Ayotte: the statute regulates conduct,\n\nnot speech, and even if it regulates commercial speech, that\n\nregulation satisfies constitutional standards.                 They also fail for\n\nreasons not present in Ayotte.         The Maine statute constitutionally\n\nprotects Maine prescribers' choice to opt in to confidentiality\n\nprotection to avoid being subjected to unwanted solicitations based\n\non their identifying data.           We also reject the argument that the\n\nstatute is void for vagueness.\n\n              Plaintiffs'    argument       that   section       1711-E(2-A)    is\n\nunconstitutional under the dormant Commerce Clause if applied to\n\nplaintiffs' out-of-state use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers'\n\nidentifying data also fails.         We interpret the Maine statute using\n\nMaine's principles of statutory construction and hold that section\n\n1711-E(2-A) regulates prescription drug information intermediaries'\n\nout-of-state use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' data.                   We\n\nhold   that    this   interpretation        does   not   raise    constitutional\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fconcerns under the dormant Commerce Clause, which might necessitate\n\na   narrower           reading    of   the   statute   under     the   doctrine    of\n\nconstitutional avoidance.\n\n                 The    Supreme    Court's   current   dormant    Commerce     Clause\n\njurisprudence does not leave Maine powerless to protect Maine\n\nprescribers who have sought to prevent the use of their identifying\n\ndata in transactions that also cause substantial in-state harms,\n\nincluding          increased       health     care     costs.          The     statute\n\nconstitutionally reaches plaintiffs' out-of-state transactions as\n\na necessary incident of Maine's strong interest in protecting\n\nopted-in Maine prescribers from unwanted solicitations, a policy\n\nthat Maine also rationally believes will lower its health care\n\ncosts.          Nor, we hold, would section 1711-E(2-A)'s regulation of\n\nprescription drug information intermediaries' out-of-state use or\n\nsale       of    opted-in    Maine     prescribers'    identifying      data    raise\n\nconstitutional concerns as a disproportionate burden on interstate\n\ncommerce under Pike v.

Factual Background\n\n                 The relevant facts are undisputed.2\n\n                 Prescriber-identifying data is used for many purposes,\n\nbut this case concerns restrictions on only one of those uses:\n\n\n\n       2\n          These facts rely in part on this court's discussion of\nthe same industry, and plaintiffs' role in that industry, in our\n2008 Ayotte opinion.   The parties have relied heavily on those\nfacts and the record from Ayotte.\n\n                                             -5-\n\fpharmaceutical      manufacturers'         use    of    the      data   to    send    their\n\npharmaceutical        sales        representatives          to    personally         market\n\nparticular drugs to particular prescribers, a practice known as\n\n\"detailing.\"     Section 1711-E defines \"detailing\" as \"one-to-one\n\ncontact with a prescriber or employees or agents of a prescriber\n\nfor the purpose of increasing or reinforcing the prescribing of a\n\ncertain drug by the prescriber.\"                 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22,\n\n§ 1711-E(1)(A-2).\n\n            Detailing is a massive and expensive undertaking for\n\npharmaceutical manufacturers, which spend billions of dollars a\n\nyear to have some 90,000 pharmaceutical sales representatives make\n\nweekly or monthly one-on-one visits to prescribers nationwide.\n\nStephanie     Saul,       Doctors    Object      as    Drug      Makers      Learn   Who's\n\nPrescribing     What,       N.Y.    Times,    May      4,    2006,      at    A1.     Each\n\npharmaceutical        manufacturer's          detailers           market        particular\n\npharmaceutical products in particular regions. A single prescriber\n\nis visited by an average of twenty-eight detailers a week; an\n\naverage of fourteen detailers a week call on a single specialist.\n\n            Prescriber-identifying data is a valuable tool in a\n\ndetailer's arsenal of sales techniques.                     With it, pharmaceutical\n\nmanufacturers can pinpoint the prescribing habits of individual\n\nprescribers    in     a    region    and   target      prescribers        who    might   be\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fpersuaded to switch brands or prescribe more of a detailer's brand\n\nof products.3   See Saul, supra, at A1.\n\n           During their one-on-one visits to prescribers, detailers\n\ndistribute upwards of $1 million worth of free product samples per\n\nyear, along with branded promotional materials and pamphlets about\n\nthe different conditions their particular products can be used to\n\ntreat.     Detailers use prescriber-identifying data to do these\n\nthings more effectively; every sales pitch can be tailored to what\n\nthe detailer knows of the prescriber based on her prescribing\n\nhistory.    The central objective is to get prescribers to adopt the\n\npharmaceutical product the detailer is marketing and to build brand\n\nloyalty.   This goal is not only explicit; it is how detailers earn\n\nbonuses.   See Saul, supra, at A1.\n\n           Some prescribers, in Maine and elsewhere, welcome these\n\ninteractions.    Detailers, they say, provide them with studies\n\nrelevant to their practices, useful free samples, and targeted data\n\nabout how widely certain new drugs have been prescribed by others.\n\nThey find that detailers provide helpful comparisons of competing\n\ndrugs used to treat the same conditions and information about new\n\n\n     3\n          When Merck marketed Vioxx, for example, it used a wealth\nof prescriber-identifying data to create monthly reports on\nindividual prescribers in each detailer's assigned territory. The\nreports showed how many Merck versus non-Merck drugs the prescriber\nprescribed and estimated how many of these prescriptions could be\nsubstituted for Merck products. Merck then tracked its detailers'\nprogress in converting prescribers in their territories to the\nMerck brand and gave detailers bonuses based on Merck's sales\nvolume and market share in the detailer's territory.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdrugs or more effective alternatives to the prescriptions they\n\ncurrently prescribe.    These prescribers say they are immune to\n\ndetailers' influence and see no conflict of interest.\n\n           Significantly, though, other prescribers have strenuously\n\nobjected that detailing intrudes into their prescribing decisions.\n\nDetailers, these prescribers insist, should not be able to use\n\ntheir prescribing histories to target them for unwelcome marketing\n\ncalls.    An article by a senior vice president of the American\n\nMedical Association (AMA) and an executive of plaintiff IMS Health\n\nnoted that physicians \"complain bitterly\" about detailers \"who wave\n\ndata in their faces\" and challenge them with their own prescribing\n\nhistories when they fail to prescribe more of the product the\n\ndetailer has been advertising.    R. A. Musacchio & R. J. Hunkler,\n\nMore Than a Game of Keep-Away, Pharmaceutical Executive, May 2006.\n\nThe head of California's state medical association has reported\n\nthat prescribers have been \"outraged that people came into their\n\noffice and talked to them about how many times they prescribed a\n\nparticular drug.\"    Saul, supra, at A1.    Aggregated survey data\n\nconfirms that physicians have a predominantly negative view of\n\ndetailing.   See P. Manchanda & E. Honka, The Effects and Role of\n\nDirect-to-Physician Marketing in the Pharmaceutical Industry: An\n\nIntegrative Review, 5 Yale J. Health Pol'y L. & Ethics 785, 788-91\n\n(2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           Many Maine prescribers have openly objected to detailing.\n\nA survey by the Maine Medical Association in 2006 revealed that a\n\nmajority     of   Maine   physicians         did   not     want    pharmaceutical\n\nmanufacturers to be able to use their individual prescribing\n\nhistories for marketing purposes.            One Maine prescriber explained\n\nthat she felt that \"it intrudes upon my privacy and my work life\n\nfor drug companies to buy my information, without my permission,\n\nfor marketing purposes.\"         She has \"ask[ed] to be removed from\n\nmailing lists and telephone call lists\" and \"would like to have the\n\nsimilar option of not allowing my professional information to be\n\nsold to drug companies for marketing purposes.\"\n\n           Detailers' use of prescriber-identifying data, however,\n\nis only the final step in a series of transactions that begin with\n\nthe acquisition and aggregation of massive amounts of individual\n\nprescribers' identifying data.          Pharmaceutical manufacturers lack\n\ndirect access to prescriber-identifying data. That fact has fueled\n\nan   enormously    profitable,       multilayered     market       for   acquiring,\n\naggregating,      packaging,   and    selling      these    data    primarily   for\n\ndetailing.    Plaintiffs are the middlemen of this market.\n\n           When     filling    prescriptions,            individual      pharmacies\n\naccumulate data about the prescriptions individual prescribers have\n\nmade, usually for insurance reimbursement.                  Pharmacies that are\n\npart of national chains normally transfer these data to the chain's\n\ncentral data warehouse.        Each pharmacy, and even each pharmacy\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fchain,    is    only   one   piece   of    a   bigger      picture;     individual\n\nprescribers, or their patients, may make prescriptions at many\n\ndifferent pharmacy locations.\n\n            This is where plaintiffs come in.              Plaintiff companies\n\nare    prescription     drug    information     intermediaries          that     mine\n\nspecialized data.       They contract with numerous pharmacies and, to\n\na lesser degree, insurance companies and other carriers, to buy\n\ntheir raw data.        Under those contracts, the pharmacy's computer\n\nsoftware collects data it sends to plaintiffs.                     The software\n\nencrypts       patient-identifying    data     so   that     plaintiffs        cannot\n\nidentify individual patients by name, but it captures information\n\ndirectly identifying prescribers by name and address and shows\n\ndetails about the particular drugs prescribed.\n\n            Plaintiffs receive and aggregate data from these various\n\nsources and then compile reports and databases.                 They assemble a\n\ncomplete picture of individual prescribers' prescribing histories\n\nby    cross-referencing      prescriber    names    with     publicly    available\n\ndatabases,      including    the   AMA's   database     of    medical     doctors'\n\nspecialties.      See Saul, supra, at A1.       Plaintiffs admit that most\n\nof their reports and databases are destined--and designed--for\n\npharmaceutical manufacturers to instruct detailers where to focus\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\ftheir efforts, identify which prescribers to target, and assess\n\ndetailers' effectiveness.4\n\n           Plaintiffs    then    license    or   sell   these   specialized\n\ndatabases and reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers, a lucrative\n\nbusiness that yielded revenues of $1.75 billion for plaintiff IMS\n\nHealth alone in 2005.5    Id.    Plaintiffs' products are the building\n\nblocks of the reports pharmaceutical manufacturers generate for\n\nindividual detailers, who use them to target prescribers in their\n\nassigned areas.\n\n                             II. The Maine Law\n\n           To date, Maine appears to be one of only three states\n\nthat have limited detailers' access to prescribers' identifying\n\ndata.    See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1711-E(2-A); N.H. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. § 318:47-f; Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, § 4631(d).          Like its\n\ncounterparts in New Hampshire and Vermont, the Maine law, section\n\n1711-E(2-A), does so indirectly: in relevant part, it states that\n\n\"a   carrier,     pharmacy      or    prescription      drug    information\n\nintermediary,\" as defined in the statute, \"may not license, use,\n\nsell, transfer or exchange for value, for any marketing purpose,\n\n\n\n     4\n          Plaintiffs also sell or license other databases and\nreports to other clients, including governments, nonprofit\norganizations, and research institutions.\n     5\n          Pharmaceutical manufacturers may also use plaintiffs'\ndata for other purposes, like to send out alerts about particular\ndrugs to prescribers who have been prescribing it or for research\nand development.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fprescription drug information that identifies a prescriber who has\n\nfiled for confidentiality protection.\"6   Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n22, § 1711-E(2-A).   Maine's law regulates the different layers of\n\nthe market for prescriber-identifying information, but it does not\n\nprohibit detailing, nor does it purport to prohibit speech by\n\ndetailers to prescribers.\n\n          Unlike similar laws in New Hampshire and Vermont, the\n\ncentral feature of the Maine law is to limit detailers' access to\n\nan individual prescriber's identifying data only if the prescriber\n\nhas affirmatively opted for this protection.7   See id.\n\n\n     6\n          \"Marketing\"    includes   \"[a]dvertising,    publicizing,\npromoting or selling a prescription drug;\" \"activities undertaken\nfor the purpose of influencing the market share of a prescription\ndrug or the prescribing patterns of a prescriber, a detailing visit\nor a personal appearance;\" \"[a]ctivities undertaken to evaluate or\nimprove the effectiveness of a professional detailing sales force;\"\nor \"[a] brochure, media advertisement or announcement, poster or\nfree sample of a prescription drug.\" Id. § 1711-E(1)(F-1).\n     \"'Marketing' does not include pharmacy reimbursement,\nformulary compliance, pharmacy file transfers in response to a\npatient request or as a result of the sale or purchase of a\npharmacy, patient care management, utilization review by a health\ncare provider or agent of a health care provider or the patient's\nhealth plan or an agent of the patient's health plan, and health\ncare research.\" Id.\n     7\n          This circuit upheld New Hampshire's statute, which\ncategorically prohibits certain entities, including plaintiffs,\nfrom licensing, transferring, using, or selling any prescriber-\nidentifying data for a commercial purpose. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§ 318:47-f; Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 47. The Vermont statute instead\nprohibits certain entities from selling, licensing, exchanging, or\npermitting the use of records containing prescriber-identifying\ndata when marketing or promoting prescription drugs unless the\nprescriber has affirmatively consented to such uses.

Only these Maine\n\nprescribers can opt in, and even opted-in prescribers' identifying\n\ndata can be used for any purpose other than detailing.                      See id.\n\n              Maine enacted section 1711-E(2-A) to achieve three stated\n\n\"compelling state interests: to improve the public health, to limit\n\nannual increases in the cost of health care and to protect the\n\nprivacy of . . . prescribers in the health care system of this\n\nState.\"8         Id. § 1711-E(1-A).

In its first\n\nstep,      Maine        prescribers    who     object    to    being     targeted     by\n\npharmaceutical            detailers    may     register       for     confidentiality\n\nprotection.9        See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1711-E(4).                  Maine\n\nprescribers         can     opt   in   for     confidentiality         protection     in\n\napplication materials with the relevant Maine licensing board. Id.\n\n§ 1711-E(4)(A). Those materials must inform Maine prescribers that\n\n\"prescription drug information that identifies the prescriber is\n\nused       for    marketing       purposes     by   carriers,        pharmacies     and\n\nprescription        drug     information       intermediaries\"        and   must    give\n\nprescribers the option of protecting the confidentiality of their\n\n\n\n       9\n          Plaintiffs' fleeting assertion that section 1711-E's\ndefinition of a \"prescriber\" encompasses any prescriber anywhere is\nflatly contradicted by section 1711-E's statement of purpose, which\nstates that the statutes' goals include \"to protect the privacy of\n. . . prescribers in the health care system of this State.\" Me.\nRev.

The\n\nlaw does not, by its terms, affect this transaction.\n\n            Section 1711-E(2-A) does regulate transactions between\n\nthose pharmacies (or pharmacy data centers) and prescription drug\n\ninformation intermediaries like plaintiffs.                Section 1711-E(2-A)\n\nprohibits   pharmacies        from   selling,   transferring,          or   licensing\n\nopted-in    Maine   prescribers'       identifying     data      for   a    marketing\n\npurpose, unless the prescriber revokes the protection.

First Amendment\n\n              We reject plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge to the\n\nMaine law.         Plaintiffs' claims fail for the same reasons we\n\nrejected their nearly identical First Amendment challenge to New\n\nHampshire's similar statute in Ayotte.           Plaintiffs' arguments here\n\nfail for another, independent reason.            Maine has set up an opt-in\n\nscheme for prescribers licensed in Maine.               Even assuming arguendo\n\nthat the Maine law restricts protected commercial speech and not\n\nconduct, we hold that it directly advances the substantial purpose\n\nof protecting opted-in prescribers from having their identifying\n\ndata used in unwanted solicitations by detailers, and thus Maine's\n\ninterests in lowering health care costs.\n\n                                        A.\n\n              In   Ayotte,     this   circuit   held    that    New   Hampshire's\n\nrestrictions on plaintiffs' licensing, use, sale, transfer or\n\nexchange   of      all   New   Hampshire     prescribers'      identifying   data\n\nregulate conduct, not speech, and thus the First Amendment does not\n\nprotect       plaintiffs'        conduct.         550      F.3d       at   51-54.\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fAyotte   alternately    held    that    even    if    the   New    Hampshire      law\n\nregulates speech, plaintiffs are at best engaged in commercial\n\nspeech and the law survives intermediate scrutiny under Central\n\nHudson Gas & Electric Corp. v.

Id. at 54-60.     Ayotte also held that reducing health\n\ncare costs is a substantial government interest; the court did not\n\nreach New Hampshire's two other asserted interests, protecting\n\ncitizens' health and protecting the confidentiality of patients'\n\nand prescribers' identifying data.             Id. at 55.     The New Hampshire\n\nlaw directly advances health care cost reduction given record\n\nevidence showing that detailing increases prescription drug costs,\n\nthat   detailers'    effectiveness      is    bound   up    with   their    use    of\n\nindividual prescribers' histories, and that reducing detailers'\n\naccess to prescribers' data would make prescribers less responsive\n\nto detailers' efforts to market costly brand-name drugs.                    Id. at\n\n55-58.   Finally, Ayotte found that New Hampshire's law is no more\n\nrestrictive than necessary to advance the state's interest in\n\ncontaining    costs,   though   its     prohibitions        extend   to    all    New\n\nHampshire prescribers' identifying data.              Id. at 58-60.\n\n           Maine's     law,    which     was     modeled     in    part    on     New\n\nHampshire's, regulates the same kind of conduct for the same three\n\npurposes: reducing health care costs in Maine, protecting Maine\n\npatients' health, and protecting Maine patients' and prescribers'\n\nidentifying data from unwanted uses in Maine.

Indeed, section 1711-E(2-A) differs from\n\nthe New Hampshire law only in ways that weaken plaintiffs' First\n\nAmendment and other challenges.       Unlike New Hampshire's law, the\n\nMaine law only prohibits plaintiffs from licensing, using, selling,\n\ntransferring or exchanging data identifying prescribers licensed in\n\nMaine who have opted-in for confidentiality protection.         See id.\n\n§ 1711-E(2-A).      Unlike New Hampshire's legislature, the Maine\n\nlegislature included specific findings that limiting detailers' use\n\nof Maine prescribers' identifying data would reduce health care\n\ncosts, ensure Maine prescribers' decisions were based on unbiased\n\nmedical and scientific evidence, and protect Maine prescribers from\n\nunwanted detailing visits.    Compare id. § 1711-E (1-A), with N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. § 318:47-f.     Maine also introduced evidence into\n\nthe record to show how section 1711-E advances Maine's three\n\nasserted interests.\n\n           Plaintiffs concede that Ayotte forecloses their First\n\nAmendment challenge and that the district court's injunction, which\n\nwas granted based on their First Amendment claims before Ayotte was\n\ndecided,   cannot   be   affirmed    on    those   grounds.   Plaintiffs\n\nnonetheless reiterate shorthand versions of the same arguments this\n\ncourt rejected in Ayotte: that their use, sale, and licensing of\n\nprescriber-identifying information is speech, not conduct, and that\n\nit is protected speech warranting strict scrutiny, not merely\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fcommercial speech.13      Their alternate claim, that the Maine law\n\ncannot survive intermediate scrutiny as commercial         speech because\n\nMaine has not introduced any evidence that the law will actually\n\nreduce health care costs, is contradicted by Ayotte's reasoning,\n\nand the record in this case supports Ayotte's conclusion.           See 550\n\nF.3d at 55-58.    There is no basis for considering these arguments\n\nanew.\n\n           We reject plaintiffs' contention that United States v.\n\nStevens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2144\"><a href=\"/opinion/2144/united-states-v-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010), undermines Ayotte's holding.\n\nStevens held that speech in the form of video depictions of animal\n\nfighting is not categorically unprotected by the First Amendment,\n\nsee id. 1585-87.    By contrast, Ayotte's initial holding was that\n\nthe New Hampshire law primarily regulated conduct, not speech. 550\n\nF.3d at 51-54.   Ayotte did suggest that any speech regulated was of\n\nsuch minimal value that it likely fell outside of First Amendment\n\nprotections.     Id. at 51-52.       That suggestion, though, was in\n\nservice   of   Ayotte's   holding    that   the   New   Hampshire   statute\n\nregulated conduct, not speech, an argument not at issue in Stevens.\n\n\n\n     13\n          Plaintiffs' overbreadth argument, not addressed by the\ndistrict court, consists of the bare assertion that the Maine law\nis overbroad because it prohibits the use of prescriber-identifying\ndata when marketing all prescription drugs, not just those drugs\nwithout any obvious financial or health benefit to patients. That\nargument is at best an assertion that section 1711-E(2-A) is not\nnarrowly tailored enough to serve Maine's interest in reducing\nhealth care costs. We rejected an analogous claim in Ayotte, see\n550 F.3d at 59-60, and the argument has no relevance to our\nalternate holding in Part III.B.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fFurther, Ayotte's alternate holding was that the New Hampshire law\n\nwould be upheld even if it regulated protected speech.

Even if the Maine law regulates protected\n\nspeech, section 1711-E(2-A) directly serves Maine's substantial\n\ninterest in vindicating Maine prescribers' rights to avoid unwanted\n\ntargeting by detailers in Maine on the basis of their individual\n\nprescribing histories.\n\n           This purpose is not solely about protecting prescribers'\n\nexpectation that their identifying data will remain categorically\n\nprivate.   See Rowe, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. at 170-72.   Prescribers' also\n\nhave a privacy interest in avoiding unwanted solicitations from\n\ndetailers who have used their individual prescribing data to\n\nidentify and target them.   Maine's stated interest, in turn, is in\n\nshielding those Maine-licensed prescribers who object to this\n\ninvasive use of their identifying information and who have opted in\n\nto a system of protection the state provides.   Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 22, § 1711-E(1-A)(B),(1-B),(B).

Maine's legislature found that\n\nmany prescribers had demanded legislative action to protect their\n\nidentifying     data   from   this    unwanted     use.     §   1711-E(1-A)(B).\n\nSection    1711-E(2-A)      does     not,    and   need    not,    directly       or\n\ncategorically prohibit detailing to address this harm.                    Rather,\n\nMaine provides exactly the protections that Maine prescribers have\n\nrequested and allows prescribers to choose whether to invoke them.\n\n           Maine's opt-in confidentiality mechanism is also a less\n\nrestrictive means of vindicating prescribers' interests in not\n\nhaving their information used in detailing.

Plaintiffs' brief claims that they\n\n\"simply sell the information\" to pharmaceutical manufacturers, and\n\nthey have no intent to market or advertise pharmaceutical products\n\nto prescribers themselves.         Plaintiffs assert that the law is\n\nunconstitutionally vague because they cannot know whether \"any\n\nmarketing   purpose\"     refers   to    their    motivation    in   selling   or\n\nlicensing   the   information     or    to    pharmaceutical   manufacturers'\n\nultimate purpose in obtaining the data.\n\n            Even if there were possible ambiguity in section 1711-\n\nE(2-A)'s terms, the law is still not void for vagueness. Statutory\n\nambiguity is a regular byproduct of legislative drafting, but the\n\n\n     17\n          Plaintiffs also introduced evidence on an AMA initiative\nthat allows medical doctors to signal that they do not want their\nprescribing data used in detailing. But the AMA has no real power\nto limit plaintiffs' and other intermediaries' use of this data;\ncompliance is monitored only through complaints to the AMA, and\nenforcement depends on plaintiffs and other intermediaries'\ngoodwill prevailing over the strong financial incentives to use\nthis data.    Moreover, the AMA scheme does not cover a host of\nprescribers like nurse practitioners or osteopathic physicians, who\nmight want to protect their prescribing data but are ineligible for\nthe AMA scheme.\n\n                                       -27-\n\fvagueness doctrine invalidates only statutes whose terms are \"so\n\nuncertain that persons of average intelligence would have no choice\n\nbut to guess at [their] meaning and modes of application.\"               United\n\nStates   v.

We interpret section\n\n1711-E(2-A)'s scope by applying the rules of statutory construction\n\nthat the state's highest court would follow.    Ayotte, 550 F.3d at\n\n61; see also Adar v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71546\"><a href=\"/opinion/71546/adar-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">597</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 714 (5th Cir. 2010).   We\n\nhold, based on the text and legislative backdrop of section 1711-\n\nE(2-A) and Maine's canons of statutory construction, that section\n\n1711-E(2-A) regulates plaintiffs' out-of-state use or sale of\n\nopted-in Maine prescribers' identifying data.\n\n          We further hold that this interpretation of the statute\n\ndoes not raise constitutional concerns under the dormant Commerce\n\nClause.   The Supreme Court's current dormant Commerce Clause\n\njurisprudence is concerned with preventing economic protectionism\n\nand inconsistent regulation, not with enforcing geographical limits\n\non states' exercise of their police power that necessarily regulate\n\ncommerce. Even under the extraterritoriality branch of the dormant\n\nCommerce Clause, the Supreme Court has not barred states from\n\nregulating any commercial transactions beyond their borders that\n\ninvolve their own citizens and create in-state harms. Nor does the\n\nMaine law create constitutional concerns under the Pike balancing\n\n\n                               -31-\n\ftest.   Plaintiffs have not shown any disproportionate burden on\n\ninterstate commerce, and the law creates substantial in-state\n\nbenefits for those Maine prescribers who have affirmatively asked\n\nMaine to protect their identifying data and for Maine in its\n\nefforts to lower health care costs.\n\n               A. Section 1711-E(2-A)'s Text and Setting\n\n          The text of the statute shows section 1711-E(2-A) was\n\nintended to apply to plaintiffs' out-of-state use or sale of opted-\n\nin Maine prescribers' identifying data.         The statutory text shows\n\nthat section 1711-E(2-A) was designed to address a significant\n\nproblem occurring in Maine, whose solution has some cross-border\n\nimplications.      The law is concerned only with \"prescribers in the\n\nhealth care system of [Maine],\" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22,\n\n§ 1711-E(1-B), not prescribers anywhere in the United States, and\n\nspecifically    those   prescribers    who   have   opted   in   to   Maine's\n\n\"mechanism   for    protecting   the   confidentiality      of   identifying\n\nprescription drug information from use for marketing purposes,\" id.\n\n§ 1711-E(1-A)(B).       The statute further recognizes that these\n\nmarketing uses occur \"[a]cross the nation\" when \"data companies\n\npurchase for marketing purposes computerized prescription drug\n\nrecords from pharmacies and insurers that identify prescribers.\"\n\nId. § 1711-E(1-A)(C).     The statutory text also identifies specific\n\nharms arising from these transactions--invasions of prescribers'\n\n\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fprivacy, increased health care costs, and harms to public health--\n\nas occurring in Maine.       See § 1711-E(1-B).\n\n          Section 1711-E(2-A)'s context confirms that the Maine\n\nLegislature intended to reach plaintiffs' out-of-state conduct\n\nbecause of its substantial connections to Maine and because it\n\ncauses harms exclusively in Maine.           Section 1711-E(2-A) targets a\n\nseries of underlying transactions that cause these harms, which\n\nstart and end in Maine, even if all the transactions covered in\n\norder to effectuate the statute's purposes do not occur in Maine.\n\nMaine prescribers' prescriptions are primarily, if not exclusively,\n\nfilled at Maine pharmacies.          Data from those Maine pharmacies are\n\nultimately      transferred     to      prescription      drug     information\n\nintermediaries like plaintiffs through contractual arrangements.\n\nPlaintiffs'     subsequent    use     and    sale   of   Maine    prescribers'\n\nidentifying   data   to   generate     detailing-oriented        databases   and\n\nreports may occur outside Maine, but those activities are bound up\n\nwith pharmaceutical manufacturers' ultimate use of the information\n\nin detailing that targets Maine prescribers in Maine.\n\n          The law also takes effect only if Maine prescribers\n\naffirmatively    indicate     that    they   want   Maine   to    protect    the\n\nconfidentiality of their identifying information.            See id. § 1711-\n\nE(1)(G-1), (2-A), (4).         Every intermediate step is limited to\n\ntransactions involving these prescribers' identifying data.                  See\n\nid. § 1711-E(2-A).        The law's ultimate effect is to prevent\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\fdetailers with Maine routes from targeting Maine prescribers with\n\ntheir own prescribing histories.           Id. § 1711-E(1-A), (1-B).\n\n              B. Presumption against Extraterritoriality\n\n          Our interpretation of section 1711-E(2-A) also comports\n\nwith Maine's canons of statutory construction.              Maine, like other\n\nstates,   generally        presumes       its    statutes       do   not    apply\n\nextraterritorially    in    the    absence      of   contrary   indications     of\n\nlegislative intent.     See Holbrook v. Libby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 483 (Me.\n\n1915); see also 73 Am. Jur. 2d Statutes § 250 (2010).                         That\n\npresumption    is   overcome      here:   the    Maine   Legislature       plainly\n\nintended section 1711-E(2-A) to regulate plaintiffs' out-of-state\n\nuse or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' identifying data.21\n\n          Maine's presumption against extraterritoriality reflects\n\ninherent limitations on the scope of states' sovereign regulatory\n\npowers.   See Stavis Ipswich Clam Co. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712\n\n(Me. 1968).    This presumption is not a per se rule because those\n\nstate powers are not mechanically limited to conduct occurring\n\nwithin a state's physical borders.           As one learned commentator has\n\nnoted, \"[i]n practice, states exert regulatory control over each\n\nother all the time . . . . [A] state's geographic territory does\n\nnot mark the outer limit of its legitimate regulatory concern.\"\n\n\n     21\n          In Ayotte, this court held that the presumption against\nconstruing New Hampshire's statute to apply extraterritorially had\nnot been overcome, not least because the New Hampshire Attorney\nGeneral insisted that New Hampshire only sought to regulate conduct\nwithin its borders. 550 F.3d at 63-64.\n\n                                      -34-\n\fG.E.

See CTS, 481 U.S. at 88-89 (upholding a\n\nstatute regulating takeovers of corporations with a strong in-state\n\nnexus by limiting the acquisition of control shares).\n\n          The    Maine   law    is   easily    distinguishable    from    the\n\ninvalidated statutes.     Those state statutes--unlike section 1711-\n\nE(2-A)--raised   independent      concerns     about   protectionism   under\n\nestablished strands of the dormant Commerce Clause.30             Moreover,\n\nunlike the Maine law, none of the invalidated statutes dealt with\n\nharms caused exclusively inside the regulating state. Nor were the\n\ninvalidated statutes limited to regulating transactions with a\n\nsignificant   inherent   connection     to    the   regulating   state,   and\n\ninvolving its own professional licensees.           Those differences, and\n\n\n     30\n          The challenged price-affirmation laws were also deemed\nunconstitutional because they discriminated against out-of-state\nentities in favor of in-state competitors, see Healy, 491 U.S. at\n340-41; Baldwin, 294 U.S. at 522, or because of their protectionist\neffects for consumers, Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 580. Likewise,\nonly a plurality in Edgar v. MITE would have invalidated on\nextraterritoriality grounds the challenged Illinois law, which\nrequired companies to obtain regulatory approval for takeover bids\nof corporations with no real relation to Illinois. See 451 U.S. at\n641 (plurality opinion). The majority only invalidated the law as\nan excessive burden on interstate commerce under Pike. Id. at 644.\n\n                                     -43-\n\fnot   the   mere     fact   that   those   statutes   directly   regulated\n\nout-of-state transactions, explain why the Supreme Court deemed\n\nthose statutes wholly extraterritorial.31\n\n            Plaintiffs' attempt to analogize the Maine law to these\n\ncases fails.       The Supreme Court has previously distinguished and\n\nupheld a state statute that regulated out-of-state commercial\n\ntransactions with a clear in-state nexus and impact.         See CTS, 481\n\nU.S. at 93.32       Other circuits have upheld similar laws on this\n\n\n      31\n          Baldwin involved a New York price affirmation statute\nthat required out-of-state milk buyers to certify that they paid\nout-of-state milk producers no more than what New York producers\nreceived.   See 294 U.S. at 519.     The Court deemed the law an\nimpermissible attempt to project New York's pricing regime on other\nstates because it had no \"direct and certain\" relationship to New\nYork's asserted interest in ensuring a supply of sanitary milk, id.\nat 524, and the asserted purpose of protecting local farmers'\neconomic welfare was impermissibly protectionist, id. at 523.\n     In Edgar v. MITE, the plurality found the Illinois corporate\ntakeover bid law had a \"sweeping extraterritorial effect\" because\nit would \"regulate a tender offer which would not affect a single\nIllinois shareholder\" and thus reached conduct in which Illinois\nhad no conceivable interest. 457 U.S. at 642 (plurality opinion).\n     Likewise, the price affirmation statutes in Healy and\nBrown-Forman were not limited to transactions involving the\nregulating state; they made in-state prices that out-of-state\nshippers charged for alcohol contingent on the price those shippers\ncharged elsewhere. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 326-27; Brown-Forman,\n476 U.S. at 576. The only in-state interest served by such laws,\nthe Court suggested, was to illegitimately protect local interests.\nSee Healy, 491 U.S. at 340-41; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 580.\n      32\n          In CTS, the Supreme Court rejected an extraterritoriality\nchallenge to an Indiana statute limiting out-of-state tender\nofferors' acquisition of control shares in certain corporations.\nThe Court reasoned that the law was limited \"only to corporations\nincorporated in Indiana\" with substantial numbers of shareholders\nin Indiana, and therefore \"every application of the Indiana Act\nwill affect a substantial number of Indiana residents, whom Indiana\nindisputably has an interest in protecting.\" 481 U.S. at 93.\n\n                                    -44-\n\fbasis.

Midwest Title Loans,\nInc. v. Mills invalidated on extraterritoriality grounds a\nprovision of an Indiana statute that forbade lenders that solicited\nor advertised their lending services in Indiana from making title\nloans to Indiana residents, unless they obtained a license from\nIndiana (and thereby agreed to be bound by Indiana's restrictions\non the kind of loans permitted).

Midwest Title reasoned that states should not be\nallowed to control interstate commerce to prevent their citizens\nfrom engaging in out-of-state conduct that the regulating state\n(but not the citizens themselves) deems harmful. See id. at 663-\n65, 666, 669.\n     The Maine law does not raise similar concerns. It regulates\nonly data from those Maine prescribers who have asked Maine to\nprotect their data. It does not force other states to apply the\nregulating state's paternalistic regulatory choices even when its\nresidents want to engage in prohibited conduct elsewhere.\n       34\n          We need not decide whether the Pike balancing test\nrequires courts to look to the relative benefits and burdens of the\n\n                                        -45-\n\fdid not make this argument to the district court; their brief on\n\nappeal cursorily asserts that the law has no in-state benefits and\n\nonly out-of-state costs.

To date, 259 Maine prescribers out of\n\nMaine's     7,500   total    prescribers       have   opted   in    to    Maine's\n\nconfidentiality protections.         Section 1711-E(2-A)'s regulation of\n\nplaintiffs' transactions would confer clear in-state benefits by\n\nenabling those prescribers to avoid unwanted targeting in Maine.\n\n            Nothing suggests that the costs to interstate commerce\n\nwould be disproportionate in relation to these benefits.                 The loss\n\nof several hundred data points in Maine, out of some 7,500 total\n\nMaine   prescribers    and   1.5    million    prescribers    nationwide,      is\n\nunlikely to seriously impact the marketability of plaintiffs'\n\nproducts.     Nor have plaintiffs shown that the costs of complying\n\nwith    section     1711-E(2-A)'s     protections       meaningfully      burden\n\ninterstate    commerce.      There   is   no    obvious    reason   why   cross-\n\n\nstatute as a whole or only to its effect on prescription drug\ninformation intermediaries. Plaintiffs have provided no data about\nrange of prescription drug information intermediaries subject to\nsection 1711-E(2-A) or the relative proportion of overall business\ntransacted in Maine versus outside it. Plaintiffs' Pike challenge\narguably fails on that basis alone; the Pike balancing test is\nabout burdens on the interstate market as a whole, not about\nburdens on particular firms. Even looking only to the law's impact\non plaintiffs' out-of-state transactions, the argument fails.\n\n                                     -46-\n\f    referencing the Maine Health Data Organization's list of opted-in\n\n    Maine prescribers to avoid using or selling this data would prove\n\n    particularly costly or difficult, let alone enough to warrant\n\n    invalidation of a state law.      We also heed the cautionary note the\n\n    Court sounded in Davis: federal courts have less institutional\n\n    competence than states in measuring the costs and benefits of\n\n    particular state regulatory schemes.

L. 789,\n\n791 (2009) (same).        The two statutes that we have reviewed, along\n\nwith Vermont's, are aimed at restricting the messages that may be\n\npresented by pharmaceutical detailers to prescribers.                    Because\n\nthese provisions have the purpose and effect of regulating the\n\ncontent of speech, their compatibility with the First Amendment is\n\na challenging issue that inevitably will be considered by the\n\nSupreme Court.\n\n             The statutes specifically seek to prevent pharmaceutical\n\ndetailers from using the prescribing histories of individual health\n\ncare professionals in their marketing approach to prescribers.                  In\n\nthe view of the States, these individualized sales pitches result\n\n\n     35\n       The decision in Sorrell has been appealed to the Second\nCircuit, and oral argument in the case (No. 09-1913) was heard on\nOctober 13, 2009.\n\n                                       -48-\n\fin the over-prescription of high-priced, brand-name drugs, thereby\n\nneedlessly increasing public expenditures on prescription drugs\n\nand, at times, harming patient health.36            In an effort to minimize\n\nthe First Amendment implications of their content-based goal, Maine\n\nand New Hampshire attempted to cut off access to the prescribing\n\ninformation at its source.       Hence, the statutes prohibit the sale,\n\ntransfer   or    other    dissemination       of    prescriber-identifiable\n\ninformation among pharmacies and other data-collecting entities for\n\nmarketing purposes, but impose no direct limitation on the drug\n\ncompanies or sales people who do the actual marketing.37 The States\n\ninsist that the laws thus regulate conduct, not protected speech.\n\n           As   I   explained        in   Ayotte,    it   begs   reality   to\n\ncharacterize    these    laws   as   regulations     of   conduct.   Maine's\n\nstatute, like New Hampshire's, must be judged for what it is – a\n\n\n     36\n        Each statute operates slightly differently.        The New\nHampshire law imposes an outright prohibition on the sale or use of\nprescriber-identifiable data for marketing purposes.     N.H. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §§ 318:47-f, 318:47-g, 318-B:12(IV) (2006).      Maine's\nstatute imposes such a prohibition only for prescribers who choose\nto prevent their prescribing information from being used to market\nprescription drugs to them – the so-called \"opt-out\" approach. Me.\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1711-E(2-A). Vermont's law has an \"opt-\nin\" feature, prohibiting certain entities from selling or using\nprescriber-identifiable    data   for   marketing    or   promoting\nprescription drugs unless the prescriber consents. Vt. Stat. Ann.\ntit. 18, § 4631.\n     37\n        The Vermont statute limits the exchange of prescriber-\nidentifiable information among the same entities as the New\nHampshire and Maine provisions, but it also bars pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers and marketers from using the information for\nmarketing or promoting a prescription drug unless the prescriber\nconsents. See Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, § 4631(d).\n\n                                      -49-\n\frestriction on protected speech subject to the demands of the First\n\nAmendment.     That view has been validated by the Supreme Court's\n\nrecent decision in United States v. Stevens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2144\"><a href=\"/opinion/2144/united-states-v-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, as construed by the State,\n\nMaine's law also has a substantial ripple effect beyond Maine's\n\nborders that requires review under the dormant Commerce Clause. By\n\nshifting the statute's focus away from the activity considered\n\nharmful – the detailers' interactions with prescribers in Maine –\n\nto the earlier sales of the data, the Legislature in practical\n\neffect targeted transactions that occur primarily outside the\n\nState.\n\n          I agree with the majority that this out-of-state reach is\n\nnot fatal.    I write separately, however, to highlight the unusual\n\nrelationship    between   the   First   Amendment   and    Commerce     Clause\n\nissues.   Indeed, after examining the law's impact on interstate\n\ncommerce, I conclude that the First Amendment is the appropriate\n\nbattleground    for   constitutional    analysis    as    these   cases   move\n\nthrough the courts.\n\n             I. The First Amendment-Commerce Clause Dance\n\n          As a reflection of the analytic difficulties posed by New\n\nHampshire's    and    Maine's   laws    on   the   use,    sale   and     other\n\ndissemination of prescriber-identifiable data, their provisions are\n\nbaffling even to their proponents.             New Hampshire's Attorney\n\nGeneral asserted in Ayotte that the law should be construed to\n\n\n                                   -50-\n\fgovern only in-state transactions, see 550 F.3d at 63-64, an\n\ninterpretation that renders the statute largely irrelevant because\n\nthe transfers of data the statute purports to restrict occur almost\n\nentirely out-of-state.        Maine, by contrast, concedes that its\n\nsimilarly worded provision reaches out-of-state activity.                  At oral\n\nargument, however, when pressed about the statute's reach, the\n\nState's counsel asserted that section 1711-E(2-A) would cover the\n\npharmaceutical       detailers'   use   in   Maine       of    the     prescriber-\n\nidentifiable data – even though the law appears to have been\n\ndesigned precisely to avoid directly restricting the detailers'\n\nspeech to prescribers.\n\n           Counsel noted, for example, that \"use in Maine is what\n\nthe statute is directed at and that would be proscribed regardless\n\nof whether or not [an out-of-state] transaction before that was\n\nsubject   to   the    Act.\"   Counsel      also   stated       that,    \"[i]f   the\n\nassumption is that the transaction between IMS or one of the other\n\nplaintiffs and the drug companies occur[s] totally outside the\n\nState, then what the statute covers is the subsequent use in Maine\n\nby the detailer.\"       That explanation is at odds with my previous\n\nunderstanding of the State's construction of the statute, which\n\nexplicitly applies to \"a carrier, pharmacy or prescription drug\n\ninformation    intermediary\"      [\"PDII\"]    –    not        to   pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies and their employees.          That explanation is also at odds\n\nwith the district court's reading of the law.                  See Rowe, 532 F.\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\fSupp. 2d at 169 (\"The Law does not make illegal a drug company's\n\nuse of opt-out prescriber information for marketing purposes. . .\n\n.   The    Law   forbids   the   PDIIs   from   selling    opt-out   data   for\n\nmarketing, but it does not prohibit the pharmaceutical companies\n\nfrom using the data for marketing.\").38\n\n             Although the plaintiffs also state in their brief that\n\ndrug companies fall within the statute's definition of a PDII, that\n\nconstruction departs from plain language and ordinary usage.                 It\n\nmay be, as plaintiffs' counsel explained at oral argument, that a\n\ndrug manufacturer could be treated as a PDII when it transacts\n\ndirectly with pharmacies or other sources of prescription data. As\n\na general matter, however, drug companies are not PDIIs, and\n\nclassifying them as such when they are not acting in that capacity\n\nis not a defensible reading of the statute.               Thus, my assumption\n\nthroughout is that the statute does not directly regulate drug\n\nmanufacturers and their employees, including detailers, unless the\n\ndrug manufacturer acts as its own PDII.\n\n             The confusion over how the statutes operate arises from\n\nthe States' attempts to achieve indirectly its ultimate objective\n\n– limiting the content of the detailers' messages.             By restricting\n\nthe dissemination of prescriber-identifiable data rather than the\n\n\n      38\n        The majority in this case makes the same assumption:\n\"Section 1711-E(2-A) does not explicitly limit detailers' use of\nprescriber-identifying data, but the earlier stages of regulation\nare meant to prevent this information from getting to detailers for\nuse in marketing.\"\n\n                                     -52-\n\fdetailers' messages themselves, the States hoped their laws would\n\nbe evaluated as restrictions on conduct rather than speech.                 The\n\nFirst Amendment consequences of regulating the content of speech do\n\nnot disappear, however, simply because the regulation operates\n\nindirectly. See infra. In this instance, the indirection has only\n\nmade the constitutional inquiry more complex.\n\n            In   particular,    the    States'     approach   magnified     the\n\nCommerce    Clause   implications      of    the   legislation   because    the\n\ntargeted transfers of prescriber-identifiable data for marketing\n\npurposes occur primarily outside of both New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nEvidently    feeling   caught   in    a     constitutional    bind,   the   New\n\nHampshire Attorney General construed her state's statute to govern\n\nonly in-state transactions – effectively stripping the law of any\n\nimpact. Although Maine has rejected such a narrow construction, it\n\nis still scrambling to define the reach of its legislation.\n\n            In my view, the States should have confronted directly\n\nthe First Amendment challenges of what they sought to do.                 Their\n\nindirect approach has not avoided First Amendment scrutiny, yet\n\nthey have generated the Commerce Clause complications that we must\n\naddress here.     Those complications might have been avoided with\n\nmore straightforward laws addressing the States' concerns about\n\npharmaceutical detailing.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -53-\n\f                          II.

In   making    that    comparison,   the   majority   repeatedly\n\ndiscounted the value of the expression that it acknowledged the New\n\nHampshire statute might regulate, describing such \"putative speech\"\n\nas \"items of nugatory informational value\" and \"of scant societal\n\nvalue.\"     Id. at 52.\n\n             However, in a recent decision considering a challenge to\n\na law criminalizing depictions of animal cruelty, the Supreme Court\n\nfirmly rejected the notion that the First Amendment's guarantee of\n\nfree speech \"extend[s] only to categories of speech that survive an\n\n\n                                      -55-\n\fad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.\"           Stevens,\n\n130 S.

The Court explained that the exclusion of\n\ncategories of speech from the protection of the First Amendment has\n\noccurred only in \"special case[s].\"            Id. at 1586; id. at 1584\n\n(listing the \"few limited areas\" where \"the First Amendment has\n\npermitted restrictions upon the content of speech\" (quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted)).       Although observing that other categories\n\nof speech may yet be identified as unprotected based on historical\n\npractice, the Court stated that its prior decisions \"cannot be\n\ntaken as establishing a freewheeling authority to declare new\n\ncategories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.\"\n\nId. at 1586.\n\n              These prescriber-information cases involve the right to\n\ndisseminate truthful information – a classic form of protectible\n\nspeech activity, even when done for a fee – and the right to use\n\nthat information in crafting a marketing message. Stevens confirms\n\nthat   such    speech   may   not   be   excluded   from   First   Amendment\n\nprotection \"on the basis that [it] is not worth it,\" 130 S. Ct. at\n\n1585, and labeling speech as conduct does not make that exclusion\n\nany more permissible.\n\n              Hence, while Ayotte governs the First Amendment analysis\n\nin this case, I adhere to my view that what is at stake is\n\nprotectible speech, not conduct.            The relevant First Amendment\n\nquestion is thus whether Maine, like New Hampshire, has adequately\n\n\n                                     -56-\n\fjustified the limited restraint on commercial speech imposed by its\n\nstatute.      Here, as in Ayotte, I conclude that the State has done\n\nso.\n\n           Maine    asserts      three    \"compelling    state     interests\"   in\n\nsupport of section 1711-E(2-A): \"to improve public health, to limit\n\nannual increases in the cost of health care and to protect the\n\nprivacy of patients and prescribers\" in the State's health care\n\nsystem.    Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1711-E(1-B).                Although I\n\nagree that these interests are substantial in theory, I doubt that\n\nthe record supports the State's contention that the challenged\n\nstatute in fact advances all of them.            I am particularly skeptical\n\nof the privacy interest.\n\n           The     Maine   law     neither      prohibits    the    practice    of\n\npharmaceutical detailing nor prevents the widespread use of any\n\nprescriber's prescribing histories.

That judgment is wrong largely for the same reasons that it\n\nwas wrong in Ayotte.\n\n             In   concluding        that        the    law    is   more   extensive        than\n\nnecessary to serve the State's interest in decreasing the influence\n\nof drug company representatives, the district court emphasized that\n\nthe     State     did    not       address        the        concern      that        detailers\n\n\"inappropriately influenc[e] Maine prescribers by showering them\n\nwith gifts in implicit exchange for prescriptions.\"                          Id.        It also\n\npointed out that prescribers are \"[t]rained as professionals\" \"to\n\nperform a sophisticated and critical public health function.\"                               Id.\n\nat 177. It stated that these trained professionals \"have access to\n\na broad range of sources to evaluate whether to prescribe a drug\n\nfor a particular patient.\"                Id.    Therefore, the law unnecessarily\n\nprotects     them     \"from       being    influenced         by   their     own       practice\n\npatterns.\" Id. Specifically on the cost issue, the district court\n\nobserved that \"some branded drugs end up being more cost effective\n\nto     the   system     as    a    whole        than    their      generic       or     branded\n\ncounterparts.\"        Id. at 178.          In that sense, the court stated, the\n\n\n                                            -60-\n\fMaine law fails to \"discriminate between beneficial detailing and\n\nharmful detailing.\"           Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nThe court thus concluded that \"ban[ning] truthful information about\n\nopt-out prescribers' prescription patterns is to overreach and\n\nrestrict more speech than is necessary to address the problem of\n\nharmful detailing.\"       Id.\n\n            The district court's narrow tailoring assessment does not\n\nadequately    take     into    account    the    premise     from      which   it   must\n\nproceed, i.e., that the State has shown that restricting the use of\n\nprescriber-identifiable data advances at least one of its asserted\n\ninterests – controlling the spiraling cost of prescription drugs.\n\nThe court seems to assume that the alternatives it describes will\n\nbe just as effective in advancing that goal.\n\n            As I have explained, the State's evidence in both Ayotte\n\nand here supports the view that, despite the expertise of medical\n\nprofessionals,       detailers     are        able   to    influence      prescribing\n\ndecisions. I also explained in Ayotte why the State could properly\n\nconclude     that    alternative     methods         for    achieving      its      cost-\n\ncontainment objective that would not burden speech, including\n\nrestricting courtesy samples and other gifts, were not equivalent.\n\nAs I noted there, \"[t]he samples and gifts are merely a preparatory\n\nstep   in   the     marketing    process;       while     they   may    increase      the\n\nprescribers'      susceptibility         to    the   sales       pitch,    the      State\n\nreasonably concluded that it is the sales pitch itself that has the\n\n\n                                         -61-\n\fmost troubling effect on the prescribers' drug choice – and is most\n\nurgently in need of regulation.\"              550 F.3d at 99.39\n\n                The fact that detailing at times has beneficial effects\n\ndoes not undermine the State's conclusion that, on balance, its\n\nharms        outweigh   its    benefits   –   particularly   where   the   State\n\nreasonably could find that the benefits of the messages about\n\nprescription drugs that are disseminated by detailers are \"largely\n\nachievable in other ways.\"           550 F.3d at 95-9640; see also Rowe, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Notably, the State's restriction on speech is\n\n\n\n        39\n       Moreover, Dr. Jerry Avorn, who also served as an expert in\nthis case, testified in Ayotte that other approaches had been tried\n\"nationally in terms of trying to restrict the freebies, trying to\nprovide doctors with other means of learning, requiring that\ndoctors take continuing ed courses,\" but that these strategies did\nnot eliminate \"this massive distortion of what doctors are\nprescribing and what the State, and its citizens, are paying for\ndrugs because of the very heavily and very effective promotional\nstrategies that are going on out there.\" 500 F.3d at 99.\n     40\n        I described in Ayotte some of the ways in which such\nmessages would continue to reach prescribers:\n\n     News reports, for example, would highlight truly\n     groundbreaking new therapies in a timely way and, indeed,\n     pharmaceutical detailers with knowledge of physicians'\n     medical specialties presumably would not need access to\n     prescribing histories to effectively promote such\n     innovations. Early adopters could be expected to respond\n     quickly with an interest in trying the new medications –\n     effectively   identifying   themselves   to   the   sales\n     representatives. In addition, . . . the statute does not\n     bar drug companies from alerting prescribers to newly\n     discovered problems with their medications.\n\n550 F.3d at 95 (footnotes omitted). Doctors also testified that\nthey learned about new drugs from medical literature, conferences,\nand colleagues.

See Ayotte,\n\n550    F.3d    at    97   (citing   cases     involving   more    comprehensive\n\nrestrictions).        As I described in Ayotte, the private setting of\n\nthe targeted messages also is relevant to the narrow tailoring\n\ninquiry:\n\n              This case differs from those in which the\n              Court has rejected advertising bans that\n              restrict the exchange of ideas in the\n              \"commercial marketplace.\" The [Act] neither\n              \"protects\" the public from information about\n              drugs nor prevents truthful advocacy by\n              pharmaceutical representatives.   Instead, it\n              prevents sales representatives from crafting\n              personal marketing messages on the basis of\n              data that credible evidence indicates has been\n              used to unduly influence prescribing choices.\n              The Supreme Court on multiple occasions has\n              reviewed    regulation    of    such    direct\n              solicitations, upholding restrictions where\n              the context raised concerns about the impact\n              of the marketing on the recipient.\n\n550 F.3d at 100.\n\n              Indeed, the narrow tailoring element of the Central\n\nHudson test is arguably more easily satisfied here than in Ayotte\n\nbecause the statute bars the marketing use of prescribing histories\n\nonly for prescribers who affirmatively choose not to have their\n\ndata   used    for    marketing     purposes   –   narrowing     the    impact   on\n\nprotected speech.         Although the State's cost-containment objective\n\nwould have modest success, at best, if few Maine prescribers choose\n\nto restrict the use of their prescribing data, the restriction on\n\nprotected speech also would be modest in that situation.                  I see no\n\n                                       -63-\n\fconstitutional barrier to the State's judgment that restricting the\n\nuse of prescriber-identifiable data in the detailing messages of\n\nonly some of its prescribers would be beneficial.41\n\n          In sum, the considerations I addressed in Ayotte to\n\nevaluate \"'whether the extent of the restriction on protected\n\nspeech is in reasonable proportion to the interest served,'\" 550\n\nF.3d at 96 (quoting Edenfield v.

The Commerce Clause\n\n                This case confirms the view I expressed in Ayotte that\n\nthe plaintiffs' Commerce Clause challenge raised a serious issue\n\nthat should not have been addressed in that case on the basis of\n\nthe limited record and the parties' cursory briefing.                      Maine\n\ndistances itself from the nonsensical construction of the New\n\nHampshire statute that was advanced by the New Hampshire Attorney\n\nGeneral and accepted by the Ayotte majority,42 admitting that its\n\nstatute inevitably reaches out of state to regulate sales of data\n\nabout        prescriptions   written   in   Maine.     Indeed,    the   activity\n\nrestricted by the Maine statute, logically construed, occurs almost\n\nentirely beyond the State's borders.43\n\nA. The Activities Regulated by the Statute\n\n                Understanding    the   sequence   of   events    implicated   by\n\nsection 1711-E(2-A) is crucial to understanding the statute's legal\n\nstatus.        To begin with the end, the statute is designed to prevent\n\npharmaceutical detailers working in Maine from using information\n\n\n\n     42\n       The New Hampshire Attorney General urged the court to read\nthe act to \"'relate only to activity that takes place\ndomestically,'\" and the panel majority adopted that view despite\nrecognizing that, so construed, the law \"may not accomplish very\nmuch.\" Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 63, 64.\n        43\n         Although the Attorney General at oral argument attempted\nto avoid committing to any specific extraterritorial reach for the\nstatute, I agree with the majority that \"[t]he text of the statute\nby its terms shows section 1711-E(2-A) was intended to apply to\nplaintiffs' out of state use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers'\nidentifying data.\"\n\n                                       -65-\n\fabout the prescribing habits of Maine prescribers to present\n\ntargeted, and therefore more persuasive, sales pitches to those\n\nprescribers.        The    statute     does    not,   however,      regulate   the\n\ndetailers' interactions with the prescribers.                Instead, the State\n\nseeks to achieve its objective indirectly by, in effect, placing a\n\nred flag on information about prescriptions written by Maine\n\nprescribers who opt into the statute's protection. The red-flagged\n\ninformation may not be used, sold or transferred \"for any marketing\n\npurpose\" by pharmacies, insurers and other entities that acquire it\n\nin the course of their business.44\n\n          In practical effect, that prohibition rarely limits any\n\ncommercial transactions in Maine.             This is so because local Maine\n\npharmacies     routinely       transfer   their    prescription      information\n\nelectronically to their out-of-state headquarters.45                 Although the\n\nred flag is attached to the information when those transfers are\n\nmade, the statutory prohibition does not affect this first movement\n\nof the data because it is not \"for any marketing purpose.\"                     Most\n\nprescriber-identifiable data leaves the State in this permissible\n\nmanner.      The   data   is    next   transferred    from    the    out-of-state\n\n\n     44\n        The statute also prohibits licensing or exchanging the\ninformation for value. For the sake of simplicity, I will refer\nprimarily to the prohibitions on the sale or transfer of the data.\n     45\n       The record indicates that, other than the data from one\nsmall supplier in Maine, the prescriber-identifiable information\nobtained by the plaintiffs is transferred in the ordinary course of\nbusiness from retail stores located in Maine to the pharmacy\nchains' out-of-state headquarters.\n\n                                       -66-\n\fpharmacy headquarters to the data mining companies – the plaintiffs\n\nin this case – who also are located outside of Maine.46                  The red\n\nflag    imposes    a    significant   restriction     on   those   out-of-state\n\ntransactions.      Although data miners use prescription information\n\nfor other reasons, including to generate reports for government and\n\nother nonprofit recipients, the most lucrative aspect of their\n\nbusiness is to aggregate the information into reports that can be\n\nsold to pharmaceutical companies for use in marketing.47\n\n             Hence, the pharmacies and data miners, although not\n\nthemselves using the prescriber-identifiable data to market drugs,\n\npresumably must impose a contractual obligation on their customers\n\nnot to use the information for that purpose in order to fulfill\n\ntheir obligations under section 1711-E(2-A).                 See Rowe, 532 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 169 n.18 (\"[T]he PDIIs are assigned the responsibility\n\nto   limit   the       pharmaceutical    companies'    use   of    the   opt-out\n\nprescriber data.\").

IMS is based in\nPlymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania.\n       47\n       Drug companies also have non-marketing uses for prescriber-\nidentified data, including determining the need for new drugs and\nimplementing prescription recall programs. Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 74\nn.29. Still, at oral argument, plaintiffs' counsel stated that\n\"[n]inety-five percent of what we do in selling to a pharmaceutical\nmanufacturer is so that it can use the information for marketing\nand detail.\"\n\n                                        -67-\n\fa data miner is unclear.    Perhaps the data miners would be deemed\n\nliable for failing to enforce the obligation unless they took\n\naction against the offending drug company; such action might\n\ninclude a refusal to continue selling the information to the\n\ncompany.48\n\n             Whatever the specific mechanism for enforcement of the\n\nstatute's prohibition, the statute's objective is to prevent the\n\nuse of any prescriber-identifiable data obtained by the drug\n\ncompanies in sales pitches by the detailers in Maine who are the\n\nstatute's real target.49   As my description of the process reveals,\n\nhowever, achieving that objective involves raising the red flag in\n\ntransactions that almost all occur beyond Maine's borders.   Nearly\n\nall of the transfers between the information possessors – the\n\n\n     48\n       The district court described the \"burden on pharmacies and\nPDIIs to police their customers\" as follows:\n\n     They can still sell the opt-out information, but they\n     cannot do so if their customers, the pharmaceutical\n     companies, are going to use the information for a purpose\n     that the Law prohibits. If the PDIIs successfully police\n     their contracts with the pharmaceutical companies, as the\n     Law contemplates, the pharmaceutical companies will not\n     be able to include opt-out prescriber information in\n     marketing their products. If they do not, then they, not\n     the pharmaceutical companies, are subject to sanction.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Given the similarity of\nthe inquiries under the different strands of the dormant Commerce\nClause, I see no reason to disregard the argument here.\n\n                                 -71-\n\f            Neither of these latter alternatives is a good fit for\n\nthe present circumstances. The per se extraterritoriality analysis\n\nmay appear literally applicable, given that the statute's red flag\n\nhas a direct impact almost exclusively on out-of-state commerce.\n\nYet, as I observed in Ayotte, \"whether extraterritoriality is\n\nimpermissible in every instance, or whether it transgresses the\n\ndormant    Commerce   Clause   only    when   the   challenged   statute    is\n\ndiscriminatory or protectionist in nature, appears to be [a]\n\nrelevant consideration.\" 550 F.3d at 105 (citing Felmly, supra, at\n\n491).     The Maine law does not by its terms impose restraints on\n\nnon-domestic businesses, and the imbalance between in-state and\n\nout-of-state effect is a matter of happenstance not design.                The\n\nstatute does not seek to achieve conformity between in-state and\n\nout-of-state commerce.53 Additionally, there is no risk of conflict\n\n\n     53\n        The pursuit of such consistency is a feature of the most\nprominent Supreme Court extraterritoriality precedents.

Hence, in\n\n\n                                   -74-\n\freviewing a statute challenged under the dormant Commerce Clause,\n\nwe are always guided by \"the Constitution's special concern both\n\nwith the maintenance of a national economic union unfettered by\n\nstate-imposed limitations on interstate commerce and with the\n\nautonomy of the individual States within their respective spheres.\"\n\nHealy, 491 U.S. at 335-36 (footnote omitted).\n\n             Indeed, even the \"rigorous form of review\" applicable to\n\ndiscriminatory legislation allows exemption for a statute that\n\n\"furthers a legitimate local objective that cannot be served by\n\nreasonable non-discriminatory means.\"               Wine and Spirits II, 481\n\nF.3d at 11.      Local needs also must qualify the \"near-fatal rule of\n\nper se invalidity\" for statutes that regulate extraterritorially.\n\nSee Felmy, supra, at 492; id. at 488 (observing that \"[o]ne may\n\ninfer\" from language in CTS Corp., 481 U.S. at 93, that \"where a\n\nstate has a significant interest in regulating a particular aspect\n\nof   interstate     commerce,     it   may    do    so,    regardless     of     the\n\nextraterritorial effect of the legislation, if the regulation also\n\naffects a substantial number of in-state residents\").\n\n            I thus see the most relevant and appropriate question as\n\nsimply    whether   Maine's     interests     are   sufficiently       weighty   to\n\njustify    any   burdens   its   law    imposes     on    interstate    commerce.\n\nWhatever the label and however we describe the level of scrutiny,\n\nthe outcome here is the same.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -75-\n\fC. Assessing the Local Interest and the Burden on Interstate\nCommerce\n\n               As discussed in Section II above, I agree that the State\n\nhas a substantial interest in reducing the cost of prescription\n\ndrugs    for    its    residents    and    that   the    State    could    reasonably\n\nconclude       that    section   1711-E(2-A)      advances       that    interest    by\n\nregulating       the    dissemination       of    information       revealing       the\n\nprescribing histories of Maine's licensed health care providers.\n\nCf. Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 94-95.              The statute's importance to the\n\nState is no different in the context of a Commerce Clause inquiry\n\nthan in the First Amendment setting.\n\n               The other side of the balance is not the same, however.\n\nThe conclusion that the statute is \"narrowly tailored\" under the\n\nCentral Hudson test for commercial speech, see 447 U.S. at 566,\n\ndoes not tell us whether the provision impermissibly burdens\n\ninterstate commerce. As I have described, the statute does in fact\n\nregulate specific activities that occur mostly out of state.                        The\n\nimpact    on    the    plaintiffs     is    not   merely       \"spillover\"    from   a\n\nprohibition directed at others; they are among the categories of\n\nentities – PDIIs – affected directly by the statute.\n\n               Moreover, the statute's impact on PDIIs is potentially\n\nenormous. Sales of prescriber-identifiable data are the bread-and-\n\nbutter of the medical data mining business, producing $1.75 billion\n\nin revenue for plaintiff IMS Health alone in 2005.                      Although only\n\nthree    states       have   thus   far    enacted      laws    designed    to   limit\n\n                                          -76-\n\fdetailers' access to prescribers' identifying information, they are\n\nat the front of a wave of similar legislation.                See Rowe, 532 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 180 n.41 (noting testimony that seventeen to twenty\n\nother states were considering similar laws); Heesters, supra, at\n\n791    (stating   that   \"numerous    other    states       have   [bills]      that\n\nsimilarly restrict the sale of prescription drug data that are\n\ncurrently pending in legislative committees\").\n\n              Hence, a conclusion that section 1711-E(2-A) comports\n\nwith    the   dormant    Commerce    Clause    could    eventually       lead    to\n\nelimination of any market for prescriber-identifiable data, which\n\nthe plaintiffs have argued would jeopardize the viability of their\n\nbusinesses.     See Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 95 n.66 (\"Plaintiffs theorize\n\nthat    the   pharmaceutical   companies      would    be    unwilling    to    pay\n\nsubstantial sums for information they cannot use in marketing,\n\neliminating the data miners' biggest customers – thereby cutting\n\noff the commercial funding that subsidizes the research and other\n\nnon-commercial uses of the data.\").54          Plaintiff IMS asserts that\n\nit will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for it to adjust its\n\nsystems to comply with the statute's restrictions; plaintiff Source\n\nHealthcare estimated that it would spend 10,000 employee hours to\n\ncomply with Maine's and Vermont's laws.\n\n\n       54\n       The fact that only 259 of Maine's 7,500 prescribers opted\ninto the statute's confidentiality protection during the period in\nwhich it has been suspended by the preliminary injunction tells us\nlittle about the law's likely impact. More activity presumably\nwill occur once the injunction is lifted.\n\n                                     -77-\n\f           The \"possible effects on the profits of the individual\n\nmanufacturers\" is not, however, the concern of the dormant Commerce\n\nClause.

Nor does\n\nMaine's      decision    to   restrict    the   use    of   certain     prescriber-\n\nidentifiable data make similar legislation more or less appropriate\n\nor necessary in other states.            There is nothing in Maine's statute\n\nthat affects other states' choices about whether, or how, to\n\nregulate prescriber-identifiable data within their own borders. As\n\nthe    Supreme   Court    observed   in    Exxon      Corp.,   \"[t]he    evil   that\n\nappellants perceive in this litigation is not that the several\n\nStates will enact differing regulations, but rather that they will\n\nall conclude that [similar] provisions are warranted.\" 437 U.S. at\n\n128.        However, \"[i]n the absence of a relevant congressional\n\ndeclaration of policy, or a showing of a specific discrimination\n\nagainst, or burdening of, interstate commerce, we cannot conclude\n\nthat the States are without power to regulate in this area.\"                    Id.\n\nat 128-29.\n\n\n\n\n       55\n        The \"subsidiary\" nature of the out-of-state transactions is,\nof course, a function of the statute's purpose to restrict speech\nin Maine.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 174. It thus may be that the demand for\naggregated data about prescribing trends will change, but not dry\nup. For example, the statute appears to permit detailers to use\naggregated data based on specialities or zip codes. See Ayotte,\n550 F.3d at 95 n.66. Moreover, if empirical data gathered in the\nfuture on the statute's impact shows that less particularized, less\nefficient detailing is negating the cost savings Maine hopes to\nachieve, the State may be persuaded to change its approach to the\nproblem. Cf. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. at 473 n.17 (\"The\nexistence of major in-state interests adversely affected by [a law]\nis a powerful safeguard against legislative abuse.\").\n\n                                   -80-\n\fThe burden on interstate commerce (the reduction in the value of a\n\nparticular type of business) is not the kind of burden that raises\n\nconstitutional concerns.       To the extent that burden is relevant to\n\nthe Commerce Clause analysis, it is easily outweighed by the\n\nState's substantial interest in bringing the cost of prescription\n\ndrugs – and health care expenses in general – under control.            Cf.\n\nPharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n, 429 F.3d at 312 (describing a law aimed at\n\n\"reduc[ing] the costs of, and increas[ing] the public's access to,\n\nprescription drugs\" as \"designed to deal with 'one of the serious\n\nproblems of our time'\").\n\n           I therefore agree that the judgment of the district court\n\nshould be reversed.\n\n                   IV. The Focus of Future Litigation\n\n           This case has allowed us to put to rest the Commerce\n\nClause challenge that was not properly teed up in Ayotte.                 In\n\naddition, in the period between our reviews of New Hampshire's and\n\nMaine's similar statutes, Stevens has reinforced my view that laws\n\nregulating   the    messages   of   pharmaceutical    detailers     restrict\n\nprotectible speech, not conduct.           Thus, as more of these cases\n\nevolve   across    the   country,   the    legal   argument   and    factual\n\ndevelopment should be framed by the Supreme Court's commercial\n\nspeech doctrine under the First Amendment.\n\n           That doctrine is the subject of ongoing debate among\n\ncommentators and in the courts, including within the Supreme Court.\n\n\n                                    -81-\n\fMuch of the ferment focuses on the narrow tailoring prong of the\n\nCentral Hudson inquiry and how close the fit must be in any\n\ncommercial   speech     case      between       the    State's     interest     and    the\n\nchallenged restriction on speech.
