The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for the employer, American Airlines, ruling that\n\nthe exclusive remedy  provision contained in the  Florida statute\n\nprotected the company from further liability.  We affirm.\n\n                          I. Background\n                                       \n\n     The  relevant facts  in this  case are  few and  undisputed.\n\nPlaintiff  Garcia, a  flight  attendant  based  in  Puerto  Rico,\n\ninjured  his back  while working  on a  flight  from San  Juan to\n\nNewark, New Jersey, in early 1991.  From 1979 through the time of\n\nthe injury, American  provided workers' compensation  benefits to\n\nits  employees  through  a policy  in  Florida,  pursuant to  the\n\nFlorida  Workmen's Compensation Act,  Fla. Stat. Ann.     440.01-\n\n440.60.  Shortly after his accident, Garcia received a \"Notice of\n\nInjury\"  form from  the airline  and  filed it  with the  Florida\n\nDepartment of  Labor.   He ultimately  received about  $44,000 in\n\nmedical and disability payments under American's Florida policy.\n\n     In January 1992,  Garcia filed this damages action in Puerto\n\nRico,  alleging that  American was  subject  to traditional  tort\n\nliability because  it had  failed to  fulfill  its obligation  to\n\nsecure  workers' compensation  coverage  for  Garcia through  the\n\nPuerto  Rico  State  Insurance Fund.    Under  the Commonwealth's\n\nworkers'  compensation  act,  an  employer  who  is  required  to\n\n                               -2-\n\nparticipate, but  does not, may be sued for damages by an injured\n\nemployee.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11,   16.\n              \n\n     In response, American  raised two primary defenses.   First,\n\nit  argued  that  it  was  not  obligated   to  provide  workers'\n\ncompensation coverage for Garcia in Puerto Rico because less than\n\n50% of his worktime  was spent there.  The airline  thus was free\n\nto  insure  its  employees  elsewhere  and,  because  Garcia  had\n\nreceived  substantial  benefits  under  the  Florida  statute  --\n\nindeed, higher benefits than would have been available in  Puerto\n\nRico --  American was  immunized from  further liability  by that\n\nact's  exclusive remedy provision.1   Second, the  airline argued\n\nthat,  to the extent statutory  immunity was not dispositive, the\n\nmatter  raised an arbitrable  minor dispute over  which the court\n\nlacked subject  matter  jurisdiction,  pursuant  to  the  federal\n\nRailway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.    151-188.\n\n     The  district court  dismissed  the  complaint on  statutory\n\nimmunity grounds,  ruling that Puerto  Rico would give  effect to\n\nthe  exclusive remedy provision contained in the Florida workers'\n\ncompensation  act.    The  court  summarized  its  conclusion  as\n\nfollows:\n\n     The  Court  finds, therefore,  that  where an  employee\n     spends over fifty (50) percent of his work time outside\n     of Puerto Rico, and is insured and compensated pursuant\n     to the workers'  accident compensation laws of  a state\n     which provides  benefits superior  to those  granted in\n     Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico would have\n\n                    \n\n     1  The  Florida  workers' compensation  act  states  that an\nemployer's statutory liability for  benefits shall be  \"exclusive\nand in  place of all  other liability of such  employer . .  . .\"\nFla. Stat. Ann.   440.11(1).\n\n                               -3-\n\n     no interest  in barring  the operation  of the  foreign\n     statute's exclusive remedy provision.\n\nThe  court did  not rule  on  American's argument  concerning the\n\nRailway Labor Act.2\n\n     On appeal, Garcia reiterates his contention that the Florida\n\nexclusive remedy  provision may  not be given  effect to  bar his\n\nclaim for common law damages in  Puerto Rico.  Our review of  the\n\ndistrict  court's  grant of  summary  judgment is  plenary.   See\n                                                                 \n\nCambridge Plating  Co. v. Napco, Inc., 991  F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1993).\n\n                          II. Discussion\n                                        \n\n     We  begin   with  a   few  basic   principles  of   workers'\n\ncompensation  law to help to put this  case into context.  First,\n\nit  is  well  established  that  an  injured  worker  may  obtain\n\nsuccessive  awards  in  different  states,  with  total  recovery\n\nlimited  to  the amount  of  the  higher  award.   4  A.  Larson,\n\nWorkmen's  Compensation Law   85.00,  at 16-18 (1992); see Thomas\n                                                                 \n\nv.   Washington  Gas  Light   Co.,  448  U.S.   261,  286  (1980)\n                                 \n\n(plurality); Industrial Comm'n of Wisconsin v. McCartin, 330 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n622, 626 (1947).  Thus, Garcia's receipt of benefits from Florida\n\ndoes  not automatically preclude  an effort to  obtain additional\n\nbenefits through his tort action in Puerto Rico.\n\n     Virtually  all  workers'   compensation  statutes,  however,\n\ncontain an exclusive  remedy provision, stating that  an award of\n\nstatutory  benefits forecloses any other type of compensation for\n\n                    \n\n     2 We also find it unnecessary to address this issue.\n\n                               -4-\n\nthe  injury, including damages  in tort.   Workmen's Compensation\n                                                                 \n\nLaw,    88.10, at 16-171.3   Employees trade their  tort remedies\n   \n\n\"for  a  system  of compensation  without  contest,  thus sparing\n\n[them] the cost, delay and uncertainty of a claim in litigation.\"\n\nMullarkey v. Florida  Feed Mills, Inc., 268 So.2d  363, 366 (Fla.\n                                      \n\n1972).    Conversely,  workers'  compensation statutes  typically\n\nallow a damages  remedy against employers who fail  to assume the\n\nstatutory  compensation  burdens.     The  theory  behind   these\n\nprovisions is self-evident.   An employer  who avoids sharing  in\n\nthe burdens  of the system is  not entitled to enjoy  its primary\n\nbenefit, the immunity  from non-statutory  liability.   Florida's\n\nand Puerto Rico's statutes each have both types of provisions.\n\n     This  case   involves  a  head-on   collision  between   the\n\nemployee's right to successive workers' compensation remedies and\n\nthe immunity granted by individual jurisdictions to employers who\n\nparticipate   in  their   own  workers'   compensation  programs.\n\nSpecifically,  Garcia  claims that  he  is  entitled to  bring  a\n\ndamages suit in Puerto  Rico -- where American was not insured --\n\ndespite  the statutory  immunity  conferred  on  the  airline  in\n\nFlorida -- where it was insured.\n\n                    \n\n     3  An exception  to the  rule  allowing successive  benefits\nawards may exist when an  exclusive remedy provision, in addition\nto   foreclosing  other  types   of  relief  within   the  state,\nspecifically bars remedies available in other jurisdictions.  See\n                                                                 \nWorkmen's Compensation Law     85.20-85.40; Thomas v.  Washington\n                                                                 \nGas   Light  Co.,  448   U.S.  261,  286-90   (1980)  (plurality)\n                \n(concurring  opinion  of  White,  J.).   This  exception  is  not\nrelevant here.  \n\n                               -5-\n\n     Garcia's argument  rests on several related contentions: (1)\n\nthat the Florida workers' compensation act is inapplicable to his\n\ninjury because  no Florida  interests were  implicated; (2)  that\n\nAmerican was  obligated to  insure him  under the  Commonwealth's\n\ncompensation scheme  because he is  a Puerto Rico  resident whose\n\njob is based there; (3) and, finally, that the inapplicability of\n\nthe Florida  statute  renders  its  exclusive  remedy  limitation\n\nimpotent,  while the neglected  obligation under Puerto  Rico law\n\nempowers him to sue American for damages.\n\n     We believe  that each  of these  premises is  flawed.   As a\n\nresult,  we conclude that  the district court  properly dismissed\n\nGarcia's tort action.\n\n     A. Applicability of Florida law.\n                                    \n\n     It is important to remember,  as noted above, that more than\n\none  workers'  compensation   statute  can  apply  to   a  single\n\ncompensable injury,  so  long as  each  state has  a  \"more-than-\n\ncasual\" interest  in the  case.  4  Workmen's Compensation  Law  \n                                                               \n\n86.00,  at 16-48.   Florida  law  may apply  to Garcia's  injury,\n\ntherefore, even if another state -- or the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico -- has more substantial interests in his claim.  \"[T]he test\n\nis not whether  [Florida]'s interest is greater than  that of any\n\nother  state, but only  whether [Florida] has  a valid interest.\"\n\nId.    86.34, at 16-60  (citing Dissell v. Trans  World Airlines,\n                                                                \n\n511 A.2d 441, 444-45 &amp; n.3 (Me. 1986)).\n\n     Garcia claims that Florida law is wholly inapplicable to his\n\ninjury, and that the exclusive  remedy provision contained in the\n\n                               -6-\n\nFlorida  workers'  compensation  statute  therefore  may  not  be\n\ninvoked to bar  his damages lawsuit in Puerto Rico.   Florida law\n\ndoes not  apply, he claims, because neither  he, his job, nor his\n\ninjury  has a  Florida connection.   He  emphasizes that he  is a\n\nPuerto Rico resident  based in Puerto Rico; that  he entered into\n\nhis  employment   relationship  with  the   airline,  a  Delaware\n\ncorporation,  in  Texas;  and  injured  himself  while  traveling\n\nbetween San Juan and Newark, New Jersey.\n\n     In  support  of his  argument,  Garcia relies  heavily  on a\n\nFlorida Supreme Court  case, Wainwright v. Wainwright,  237 So.2d\n                                                     \n\n154 (1970),  in which  a Georgia resident  employed by  a Georgia\n\ncorporation   sought   benefits   under   the  Florida   workers'\n\ncompensation statute  for  an injury  suffered in  Georgia.   The\n\ncourt upheld the  administrative denial of the claim  and, in the\n\ncourse  of its  opinion,  noted  that the  statute  could not  be\n\napplied \"to other states in which . . . the State  of Florida has\n\nno interest and to cases over  which the State of Florida has  no\n\nauthority,\" id. at  156.  Garcia maintains that  the same factors\n               \n\nupon which the  Florida Supreme Court relied to  reject the claim\n\nin Wainwright  exist here: an  extraterritorial injury to  a non-\n             \n\nresident employee working for an out-of-state employer.\n\n     Garcia's  argument, and  his  reliance  on  Wainwright,  are\n                                                           \n\nmisplaced.  Unlike in Wainwright, neither the employer's business\n                                \n\nnor  the employee's work are located exclusively outside Florida.\n                                                        \n\nAmerican  Airlines  operates  in Florida,  and  Garcia  worked on\n\nflights into and out of at  least two Florida cities.  See  Sworn\n                                                          \n\n                               -7-\n\nStatement  of Jorge Olascoaga,  Flight Service Supervisor,  at 6.\n\nAlthough  Garcia  is  correct that  Florida's  contacts  with his\n\ninjury are  limited, this  is  at least  in part  because of  the\n\ninherently mobile nature of both his job and American's business.\n\nThe  airline has  21,000  flight  attendants  spread  across  the\n\ncountry, and no single state has  a substantial relationship with\n\nall of them.4\n\n     Moreover, even if these contacts were deemed insufficient to\n\ntrigger  the coverage  provisions of  the  Florida act  directly,\n\nGarcia  nevertheless  would  be  covered  because  of  American's\n\nvoluntary assumption of liability under the Florida system.   The\n\nFlorida statute permits  an otherwise excluded employer  to waive\n\nthe exclusion  and bring itself  or a specific injury  within the\n\nact's coverage by choosing to participate in the Florida worker's\n\ncompensation  scheme.   See Fla.  Stat. Ann.    440.04(2).5   See\n                                                                 \n\nMandico v. Taos Construction, 605 So.2d 850, 852 (Fla. 1992) (per\n                            \n\ncuriam); Blair v. Edward G.  Gerrits, Inc., 193 So.2d 172, 174-75\n                                          \n\n                    \n\n     4  Not all  flight  attendants  based  in  Puerto  Rico  are\nresidents of  the Commonwealth.   The Puerto Rico  group includes\nresidents of Florida and the United States Virgin Islands.\n\n     5 Section 440.04(2) provides:\n\n     When any policy  or contract of insurance  specifically\n     secures the benefits of this chapter to  any person not\n     included  in  the  definition  of  \"employee\" or  whose\n     services  are   not  included  in  the   definition  of\n     \"employment\" or  who is otherwise  excluded or exempted\n     from the operation  of this chapter, the  acceptance of\n     such policy or contract of insurance by the insured and\n     the writing of  same by the carrier shall  constitute a\n     waiver of such exclusion or exemption and an acceptance\n     of the provisions of this  chapter with respect to such\n     person . . . .\n\n                               -8-\n\n(Fla.  1966); Rainwater v.  Vikings Men's Hairstyling,  382 So.2d\n                                                     \n\n1313, 1314-15  (Fla. App. 1980).   For more than a  decade before\n\nGarcia's   accident,  American   voluntarily  provided   accident\n\ninsurance for  its employees  in Florida, and,  in this  case, it\n\nspecifically  facilitated Garcia's  application  for benefits  by\n\nproviding him with the required form.\n\n     Even  more to the  point, we think  it decidedly inequitable\n\nfor Garcia to claim that Florida law is  inapplicable now that he\n\nhas  received all  the  benefits  that  law provides.    Workers'\n\ncompensation   systems  are  designed  around  a  quid  pro  quo:\n                                                                \n\nemployees  secure \"a practical  and expeditious remedy  for their\n\nindustrial accidents,\" Cardillo  v. Liberty Mutual Co.,  330 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n469,   476  (1947),  while   employers  secure  \"a   limited  and\n\ndeterminate  liability,\" id.   Unlike  in  Wainwright, where  the\n                                                     \n\nemployer and the Florida Industrial Claims Commission both denied\n\nthe   employee's  claim   for  benefits,   Garcia  has   received\n\nsubstantial compensation under the Florida scheme.  Indeed, it is\n\nundisputed that the compensation he received exceeds the benefits\n\nto  which he  would have  been  entitled under  Puerto Rico  law.\n\nGarcia makes  no offer  to return the  Florida benefits.   Having\n\nacquiesced in the applicability of Florida law when it suited his\n\ninterest,  Garcia  cannot  fairly  be  allowed  to  disclaim  its\n\napplication now.6\n\n                    \n\n     6 Garcia's  uncontested receipt  of benefits  in Florida  is\nperhaps  the  single   most  significant  distinction  from   the\nWainwright  case inasmuch as it  shows American's intent to waive\n          \nany possible exclusion  from coverage under the Florida  act.  In\nrejecting  the request for  benefits in Wainwright,  the Judge of\n                                                  \n\n                               -9-\n\n     Determining that  Florida law may  be applied does  not lead\n\ninevitably, however, to the conclusion that the present action is\n\nbarred   by  the   exclusive   remedy   provision  in   Florida's\n\ncompensation act.  The Supreme Court repeatedly  has rejected the\n\nnotion that the Full Faith  and Credit Clause of the Constitution\n\nrequires  a second jurisdiction  to defer to  limiting provisions\n\ncontained   in  the  workers'  compensation  legislation  of  the\n\njurisdiction  in which an injured worker first received benefits.\n\n4 Workmen's Compensation Law   88.12, at 16-183.  See Thomas, 448\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at  279-80, 284-86; Carroll  v.

This means that Garcia not\n                \n\nonly  is permitted  to seek  additional benefits,  but  also that\n\nPuerto  Rico  is  free to  disregard  Florida's  exclusive remedy\n\nprovision.\n\n                    \n\nIndustrial Claims  made  a specific  finding  that there  was  no\nwaiver,  and  the   state  supreme  court  held   that  competent\nsubstantial evidence supported that ruling.  237 So.2d at 156-57.\n\n     Moreover,  in  light of  Garcia's  acceptance  of undisputed\nbenefits,  we see  no reason  to dwell  on the  substantiality of\nFlorida's  relationship  to the  injury.    Given the  policy  of\nsuccessive awards, the only relevant concern is whether Florida's\nexercise  of jurisdiction  would compromise  the  law of  another\njurisdiction  with more substantial contacts, in violation of the\nFull Faith and Credit Clause  of the Constitution.

The rationale\n       \n\nunderlying this  uniform treatment  is compelling.   The  central\n\npurpose  of compensation  acts is  \"to substitute  a limited  but\n\ncertain  remedy for  the former  remedy in  tort --  a compromise\n\nbenefiting both employer and employee.\" 4  Workmen's Compensation\n                                                                 \n\nLaw, at   88.13, at 16-187 (citing Wilson v.

When an employee who has received benefits\n\nunder such a compensation scheme later tries to get back into the\n\ncommon-law  damage  system,  he   is  essentially  un-doing  this\n\nfundamental quid pro  quo.  See Restatement  (Second) of Conflict\n                               \n\nof Laws    183, 184 (1971).7   Courts that give effect to foreign\n\n                    \n\n     7 Comment c of   183 states, in part:\n\n     The grant of two or  more awards to an injured employee\n     is  not repugnant to  the basic principle  of workmen's\n     compensation which is  to impose  absolute but  limited\n     liability upon the employer.  For a State, on the other\n     hand, to subject  a person who has been  held liable in\n     workmen's compensation  to further  unlimited liability\n     in tort or wrongful death would frustrate the workmen's\n     compensation policy of the State in which the award was\n     rendered.\n\nSee also   184,  comment b (\"A person who accepts  an award under\n        \nthe workmen's compensation statute of a given state may justly be\nheld bound by the provisions  of that statute insofar as immunity\n\n                               -11-\n\nexclusive remedy provisions  therefore do so to  effectuate broad\n\ncompensation  principles.  See Wilson, 141  A.2d at 778; Woodner,\n                                                                \n\n210 F.2d at 874.\n\n     Whether Puerto Rico would follow this course  in the present\n\ncircumstances  is  the  ultimate question  we  must  answer.   We\n\ntherefore turn to a review of the relevant Puerto Rico law.\n\n     B. Applying Puerto Rico law\n                                \n\n     Garcia  claims  that  Puerto   Rico  law  requires  American\n\nAirlines to participate in the Commonwealth's insurance fund, and\n\nthat  the  airline's failure  to  do  so  makes it  an  uninsured\n\nemployer subject  to a tort suit  under section 16  of the Puerto\n\nRico Workmen's Accident Compensation Act, 11 P.R. Laws Ann.   16.\n\nHis receipt  of benefits from  Florida does not foreclose  such a\n\nsuit,  Garcia   maintains,  in   light  of  \"the   Commonwealth's\n\nunequivocal policy that all employers carrying business in Puerto\n\nRico must contribute  to the financial feasibility  of the Fund.\"\n\nHe  asserts  that  allowing  employers  to  escape  liability  by\n\nobtaining insurance elsewhere  would undermine the Commonwealth's\n\ncompensation framework.\n\n     In  emphasizing Commonwealth policy, Garcia has put his best\n\nfoot forward.  Courts that have rejected application of a foreign\n\nstate's exclusive remedy provision have done so because the forum\n\nstate's  policy  would  be disadvantaged.    See,  e.g., Reid  v.\n                                                             \n\nHansen, 440 N.W.2d  598, 601-02 (Iowa 1989)  (plaintiff's receipt\n      \n\n                    \n\nfrom tort and wrongful death liability is concerned.\")\n\n                               -12-\n\nof  benefits in  Nebraska does  not  bar tort  action under  Iowa\n\nstatute); Davis  v. Morrison-Knudsen Co.,  289 F. Supp.  835, 838\n                                        \n\n(D.  Ore. 1968) (Oregon's policy  of providing incentive to elect\n\ncoverage  in Oregon would  be undercut by  Idaho exclusive remedy\n\nprovision).  If  Garcia were correct that barring  his suit would\n\nconflict  with  Commonwealth  compensation  policy, his  position\n\nwould have considerable force.\n\n     We can  find no conflict,  however.  Puerto  Rico's workers'\n\ncompensation act, like all such laws, reflects a primary interest\n\nin ensuring  that the burden  resulting from an  employee's work-\n\nrelated injury falls upon his employer rather than the individual\n\nor his community.  See, e.g., Crider v. Zurich Ins. Co., 380 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n39, 41  (1965); Delano v. City  of South Portland, 405  A.2d 222,\n                                                 \n\n225 (Me. 1979).  As  the district court recognized, this interest\n\n\"has been amply satisfied by the benefits Garcia received through\n\nFlorida's  workers'  accident  compensation system\"  --  benefits\n\nexceeding those available under the  Puerto Rico statute.  Puerto\n\nRico's  policy,  like  Florida's,  immunizes  employers  who  pay\n\nstatutory benefits from  further liability.  P.R.  Laws Ann. tit.\n\n11,    21.  Because the two governments agree on the compensation\n\nquid  pro  quo,  Puerto  Rico  would have  no  reason  to  reject\n              \n\nFlorida's exclusive remedy provision unless it had an interest in\n\nproviding  an incentive  for American  and  similar employers  to\n\ninsure their employees specifically in the Commonwealth.\n\n     Our reading of  Puerto Rico policy, however,  indicates that\n\nthe Commonwealth expressly has disclaimed an interest in covering\n\n                               -13-\n\nemployees who  do most of their work outside  Puerto Rico.  In an\n\nopinion  and subsequent  explanatory  letter, the  Commonwealth's\n\nSecretary of Justice concluded that flight attendants who perform\n\nmore  than 50%  of their  work  elsewhere are  excluded from  the\n\ncoverage of the  Commonwealth's labor laws and Section  16 of the\n\nBill of Rights of the Puerto  Rico Constitution, which guarantees\n\nvarious   employment-related  rights,   including  safe   working\n\nconditions and a reasonable minimum  salary.

Sec.\nJust., No. 1977-22, Trans., at 2 (Oct. 21, 1977).\n\n                               -14-\n\nunderlying rationale reaches that system.  The Secretary's intent\n\nthat his determination  be applied broadly is  strongly suggested\n\nby the  explanatory  letter,  in which  he  concluded  that  even\n\nemployees of a Puerto Rico  airline are excluded from coverage of\n\nthe Commonwealth's  labor laws because they spend the majority of\n\ntheir work time outside the jurisdictional limits of Puerto Rico.\n\nSee Letter  of Dec. 28, 1977, Trans., at 2.   We think it follows\n   \n\nnaturally  from  this  inclusive approach  that  the  opinions be\n\ninterpreted to encompass  all legislation designed to  govern the\n\nemployer-employee   relationship,  including   the  Puerto   Rico\n\nWorkmen's Accident Compensation Act.\n\n     Puerto Rico,  therefore, would  have no  reason to  penalize\n\nAmerican Airlines  for providing workers'  compensation insurance\n\nfor  Garcia under  the  Florida system  rather  than through  the\n\nPuerto Rico Insurance Fund,  particularly since Florida  provided\n\nsuperior benefits.

The district court granted summary judgment for the employer, American Airlines, ruling that the exclusive remedy provision contained in the Florida statute protected the company from further liability.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts in this case are few and undisputed.  Plaintiff Garcia, a flight attendant based in Puerto Rico, injured his back while working on a flight from San Juan to Newark, New Jersey, in early 1991.  From 1979 through the time of the injury, American provided workers' compensation benefits to its employees through a policy in Florida, pursuant to the Florida Workmen's Compensation Act, Fla.Stat.Ann. Secs. 440.01-440.60.  Shortly after his accident, Garcia received a \"Notice of Injury\" form from the airline and filed it with the Florida Department of Labor.  He ultimately received about $44,000 in medical and disability payments under American's Florida policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1992, Garcia filed this damages action in Puerto Rico, alleging that American was subject to traditional tort liability because it had failed to fulfill its obligation to secure workers' compensation coverage for Garcia through the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund.  Under the Commonwealth's workers' compensation act, an employer who is required to participate, but does not, may be sued for damages by an injured employee.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11, Sec. 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, American raised two primary defenses.  First, it argued that it was not obligated to provide workers' compensation coverage for Garcia in Puerto Rico because less than 50% of his worktime was spent there.  The airline thus was free to insure its employees elsewhere and, because Garcia had received substantial benefits under the Florida statute--indeed, higher benefits than would have been available in Puerto Rico--American was immunized from further liability by that act's exclusive remedy provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Second, the airline argued that, to the extent statutory immunity was not dispositive, the matter raised an arbitrable minor dispute over which the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to the federal Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. Secs. 151-188.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the complaint on statutory immunity grounds, ruling that Puerto Rico would give effect to the exclusive remedy provision contained in the Florida workers' compensation act.  The court summarized its conclusion as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>The Court finds, therefore, that where an employee spends over fifty (50) percent of his work time outside of Puerto Rico, and is insured and compensated pursuant to the workers' accident compensation laws of a state which provides benefits superior to those granted in Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico would have no interest in barring the operation of the foreign statute's exclusive remedy provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did not rule on American's argument concerning the Railway Labor Act, 816 F.Supp. 72.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Garcia reiterates his contention that the Florida exclusive remedy provision may not be given effect to bar his claim for common law damages in Puerto Rico.  Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is plenary.  See Cambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 991 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a few basic principles of workers' compensation law to help to put this case into context.  First, it is well established that an injured worker may obtain successive awards in different states, with total recovery limited to the amount of the higher award.  4 A. Larson, Workmen's Compensation Law Sec. 85.00, at 16-18 (1992);  see Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261, 286, 100 S.Ct. 2647, 2663, 65 L.Ed.2d 757 (1980) (plurality);  Industrial Comm'n of Wisconsin v. McCartin, 330 U.S. 622, 626, 67 S.Ct. 886, 889, 91 L.Ed. 1140 (1947).  Thus, Garcia's receipt of benefits from Florida does not automatically preclude an effort to obtain additional benefits through his tort action in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually all workers' compensation statutes, however, contain an exclusive remedy provision, stating that an award of statutory benefits forecloses any other type of compensation for the injury, including damages in tort.  Workmen's Compensation Law, Sec. 88.10, at 16-171.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Employees trade their tort remedies \"for a system of compensation without contest, thus sparing [them] the cost, delay and uncertainty of a claim in litigation.\"  Mullarkey v. Florida Feed Mills, Inc., 268 So.2d 363, 366 (Fla.1972).  Conversely, workers' compensation statutes typically allow a damages remedy against employers who fail to assume the statutory compensation burdens.  The theory behind these provisions is self-evident.  An employer who avoids sharing in the burdens of the system is not entitled to enjoy its primary benefit, the immunity from non-statutory liability.  Florida's and Puerto Rico's statutes each have both types of provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves a head-on collision between the employee's right to successive workers' compensation remedies and the immunity granted by individual jurisdictions to employers who participate in their own workers' compensation programs.  Specifically, Garcia claims that he is entitled to bring a damages suit in Puerto Rico--where American was not insured--despite the statutory immunity conferred on the airline in Florida--where it was insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia's argument rests on several related contentions:  (1) that the Florida workers' compensation act is inapplicable to his injury because no Florida interests were implicated;  (2) that American was obligated to insure him under the Commonwealth's compensation scheme because he is a Puerto Rico resident whose job is based there;  (3) and, finally, that the inapplicability of the Florida statute renders its exclusive remedy limitation impotent, while the neglected obligation under Puerto Rico law empowers him to sue American for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that each of these premises is flawed.  As a result, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Garcia's tort action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Applicability of Florida law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to remember, as noted above, that more than one workers' compensation statute can apply to a single compensable injury, so long as each state has a \"more-than-casual\" interest in the case.  4 Workmen's Compensation Law Sec. 86.00, at 16-48.  Florida law may apply to Garcia's injury, therefore, even if another state--or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico--has more substantial interests in his claim.  \"[T]he test is not whether [Florida]'s interest is greater than that of any other state, but only whether [Florida] has a valid interest.\"   Id. Sec. 86.34, at 16-60 (citing Dissell v. Trans World Airlines, 511 A.2d 441, 444-45 &amp; n. 3 (Me.1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia claims that Florida law is wholly inapplicable to his injury, and that the exclusive remedy provision contained in the Florida workers' compensation statute therefore may not be invoked to bar his damages lawsuit in Puerto Rico.  Florida law does not apply, he claims, because neither he, his job, nor his injury has a Florida connection.  He emphasizes that he is a Puerto Rico resident based in Puerto Rico;  that he entered into his employment relationship with the airline, a Delaware corporation, in Texas;  and injured himself while traveling between San Juan and Newark, New Jersey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his argument, Garcia relies heavily on a Florida Supreme Court case, Wainwright v. Wainwright, 237 So.2d 154 (1970), in which a Georgia resident employed by a Georgia corporation sought benefits under the Florida workers' compensation statute for an injury suffered in Georgia.  The court upheld the administrative denial of the claim and, in the course of its opinion, noted that the statute could not be applied \"to other states in which ... the State of Florida has no interest and to cases over which the State of Florida has no authority,\" id. at 156.   Garcia maintains that the same factors upon which the Florida Supreme Court relied to reject the claim in Wainwright exist here:  an extraterritorial injury to a non-resident employee working for an out-of-state employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia's argument, and his reliance on Wainwright, are misplaced.  Unlike in Wainwright, neither the employer's business nor the employee's work are located exclusively outside Florida.  American Airlines operates in Florida, and Garcia worked on flights into and out of at least two Florida cities.  See Sworn Statement of Jorge Olascoaga, Flight Service Supervisor, at 6.  Although Garcia is correct that Florida's contacts with his injury are limited, this is at least in part because of the inherently mobile nature of both his job and American's business.  The airline has 21,000 flight attendants spread across the country, and no single state has a substantial relationship with all of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if these contacts were deemed insufficient to trigger the coverage provisions of the Florida act directly, Garcia nevertheless would be covered because of American's voluntary assumption of liability under the Florida system.  The Florida statute permits an otherwise excluded employer to waive the exclusion and bring itself or a specific injury within the act's coverage by choosing to participate in the Florida worker's compensation scheme.  See Fla.Stat.Ann. Sec. 440.04(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Mandico v. Taos Construction, 605 So.2d 850, 852 (Fla.1992) (per curiam);  Blair v. Edward G. Gerrits, Inc., 193 So.2d 172, 174-75 (Fla.1966);  Rainwater v. Vikings Men's Hairstyling, 382 So.2d 1313, 1314-15 (Fla.App.1980).  For more than a decade before Garcia's accident, American voluntarily provided accident insurance for its employees in Florida, and, in this case, it specifically facilitated Garcia's application for benefits by providing him with the required form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more to the point, we think it decidedly inequitable for Garcia to claim that Florida law is inapplicable now that he has received all the benefits that law provides.  Workers' compensation systems are designed around a quid pro quo:  employees secure \"a practical and expeditious remedy for their industrial accidents,\" Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Co., 330 U.S. 469, 476, 67 S.Ct. 801, 806, 91 L.Ed. 1028 (1947), while employers secure \"a limited and determinate liability,\" id.   Unlike in Wainwright, where the employer and the Florida Industrial Claims Commission both denied the employee's claim for benefits, Garcia has received substantial compensation under the Florida scheme.  Indeed, it is undisputed that the compensation he received exceeds the benefits to which he would have been entitled under Puerto Rico law.  Garcia makes no offer to return the Florida benefits.  Having acquiesced in the applicability of Florida law when it suited his interest, Garcia cannot fairly be allowed to disclaim its application now.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining that Florida law may be applied does not lead inevitably, however, to the conclusion that the present action is barred by the exclusive remedy provision in Florida's compensation act.  The Supreme Court repeatedly has rejected the notion that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution requires a second jurisdiction to defer to limiting provisions contained in the workers' compensation legislation of the jurisdiction in which an injured worker first received benefits.  4 Workmen's Compensation Law Sec. 88.12, at 16-183.  See Thomas, 448 U.S. at 279-80, 284-86, 100 S.Ct. at 2659-60;  Carroll v. Lanza, 349 U.S. 408, 413-14, 75 S.Ct. 804, 807-08, 99 L.Ed. 1183 (1955);  McCartin, 330 U.S. at 628-30, 67 S.Ct. at 889-90.   This means that Garcia not only is permitted to seek additional benefits, but also that Puerto Rico is free to disregard Florida's exclusive remedy provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a worker's second claim is for common-law damages rather than additional benefits, however, most states, on grounds of comity and policy, will respect the other jurisdiction's exclusive remedy provision immunizing the employer from non-statutory liability.  4 Workmen's Compensation Law, Secs. 88.00, 88.10, at 16-171-183 (citing cases);  see, e.g., Kelly v. Guyon Gen. Piping, Inc., 882 F.2d 108, 110 (4th Cir.1989);  Woodner v. Mathers, 210 F.2d 868, 873-74 (D.C.Cir.1954).  The rationale underlying this uniform treatment is compelling.  The central purpose of compensation acts is \"to substitute a limited but certain remedy for the former remedy in tort--a compromise benefiting both employer and employee.\"   4 Workmen's Compensation Law, at Sec. 88.13, at 16-187 (citing Wilson v. Faull, 27 N.J. 105, 141 A.2d 768 (1958)).  When an employee who has received benefits under such a compensation scheme later tries to get back into the common-law damage system, he is essentially un-doing this fundamental quid pro quo.  See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws Secs. 183, 184 (1971).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Courts that give effect to foreign exclusive remedy provisions therefore do so to effectuate broad compensation principles.  See Wilson, 141 A.2d at 778;  Woodner, 210 F.2d at 874.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Puerto Rico would follow this course in the present circumstances is the ultimate question we must answer.  We therefore turn to a review of the relevant Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Applying Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia claims that Puerto Rico law requires American Airlines to participate in the Commonwealth's insurance fund, and that the airline's failure to do so makes it an uninsured employer subject to a tort suit under section 16 of the Puerto Rico Workmen's Accident Compensation Act, 11 P.R. Laws Ann. Sec. 16.  His receipt of benefits from Florida does not foreclose such a suit, Garcia maintains, in light of \"the Commonwealth's unequivocal policy that all employers carrying business in Puerto Rico must contribute to the financial feasibility of the Fund.\"   He asserts that allowing employers to escape liability by obtaining insurance elsewhere would undermine the Commonwealth's compensation framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In emphasizing Commonwealth policy, Garcia has put his best foot forward.  Courts that have rejected application of a foreign state's exclusive remedy provision have done so because the forum state's policy would be disadvantaged.  See, e.g., Reid v. Hansen, 440 N.W.2d 598, 601-02 (Iowa 1989) (plaintiff's receipt of benefits in Nebraska does not bar tort action under Iowa statute);  Davis v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 289 F.Supp. 835, 838 (D.Ore.1968) (Oregon's policy of providing incentive to elect coverage in Oregon would be undercut by Idaho exclusive remedy provision).  If Garcia were correct that barring his suit would conflict with Commonwealth compensation policy, his position would have considerable force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can find no conflict, however.  Puerto Rico's workers' compensation act, like all such laws, reflects a primary interest in ensuring that the burden resulting from an employee's work-related injury falls upon his employer rather than the individual or his community.  See, e.g., Crider v. Zurich Ins. Co., 380 U.S. 39, 41, 85 S.Ct. 769, 770, 13 L.Ed.2d 641 (1965);  Delano v. City of South Portland, 405 A.2d 222, 225 (Me.1979).  As the district court recognized, this interest \"has been amply satisfied by the benefits Garcia received through Florida's workers' accident compensation system\"--benefits exceeding those available under the Puerto Rico statute.  Puerto Rico's policy, like Florida's, immunizes employers who pay statutory benefits from further liability.  P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 11, Sec. 21.  Because the two governments agree on the compensation quid pro quo, Puerto Rico would have no reason to reject Florida's exclusive remedy provision unless it had an interest in providing an incentive for American and similar employers to insure their employees specifically in the Commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reading of Puerto Rico policy, however, indicates that the Commonwealth expressly has disclaimed an interest in covering employees who do most of their work outside Puerto Rico.  In an opinion and subsequent explanatory letter, the Commonwealth's Secretary of Justice concluded that flight attendants who perform more than 50% of their work elsewhere are excluded from the coverage of the Commonwealth's labor laws and Section 16 of the Bill of Rights of the Puerto Rico Constitution, which guarantees various employment-related rights, including safe working conditions and a reasonable minimum salary.  See Op.Sec.Just., No. 1977-22, Trans.  (Oct. 21, 1977);  Letter of Dec. 28, 1977, Trans.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In making this determination, the Secretary relied on federal and Commonwealth caselaw indicating that \"job situs\" is \"fundamental and determinative\" with respect to the applicability of labor laws, Op.Sec.Just., Trans., at 6 (citing Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers Int'l Union, et al. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 426 U.S. 407, 420-21, 96 S.Ct. 2140, 2146-47, 48 L.Ed.2d 736 (1976) (job situs is controlling factor as to whether state can apply its right-to-work laws);  Green Giant Co. and Saint Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 104 P.R.Dec. 489, 4 Off.Trans. 682, 697 (1975) (constitutional guarantee of overtime compensation does not apply to Puerto Rico migrant workers who work outside of Puerto Rico)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Secretary's opinion does not explicitly address the workers' compensation statute, we are persuaded that its underlying rationale reaches that system.  The Secretary's intent that his determination be applied broadly is strongly suggested by the explanatory letter, in which he concluded that even employees of a Puerto Rico airline are excluded from coverage of the Commonwealth's labor laws because they spend the majority of their work time outside the jurisdictional limits of Puerto Rico.  See Letter of Dec. 28, 1977, Trans., at 2.  We think it follows naturally from this inclusive approach that the opinions be interpreted to encompass all legislation designed to govern the employer-employee relationship, including the Puerto Rico Workmen's Accident Compensation Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico, therefore, would have no reason to penalize American Airlines for providing workers' compensation insurance for Garcia under the Florida system rather than through the Puerto Rico Insurance Fund, particularly since Florida provided superior benefits.  See generally Alcoa Steamship Co. v. Velez, 376 F.2d 521, 524 (1st Cir.1967) (intention by Puerto Rico legislature that its workers' compensation act \"not be used as a vehicle to require the maintenance of duplicating compensation insurance by an employer\").  Accordingly, we agree with the district court that American Airlines is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because Puerto Rico would respect the statutory immunity granted the company under Florida's worker's compensation statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Florida workers' compensation act states that an employer's statutory liability for benefits shall be \"exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer....\"  Fla.Stat.Ann.

Given the policy of successive awards, the only relevant concern is whether Florida's exercise of jurisdiction would compromise the law of another jurisdiction with more substantial contacts, in violation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution.

The district court granted summary judgment for the employer, American Airlines, ruling that the exclusive remedy provision contained in the Florida statute protected the company from further liability.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts in this case are few and undisputed.  Plaintiff Garcia, a flight attendant based in Puerto Rico, injured his back while working on a flight from San Juan to Newark, New Jersey, in early 1991.  From 1979 through the time of the injury, American provided workers' compensation benefits to its employees through a policy in Florida, pursuant to the Florida Workmen's Compensation Act, Fla.Stat.Ann. Secs. 440.01-440.60.  Shortly after his accident, Garcia received a \"Notice of Injury\" form from the airline and filed it with the Florida Department of Labor.  He ultimately received about $44,000 in medical and disability payments under American's Florida policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1992, Garcia filed this damages action in Puerto Rico, alleging that American was subject to traditional tort liability because it had failed to fulfill its obligation to secure workers' compensation coverage for Garcia through the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund.  Under the Commonwealth's workers' compensation act, an employer who is required to participate, but does not, may be sued for damages by an injured employee.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11, Sec. 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, American raised two primary defenses.  First, it argued that it was not obligated to provide workers' compensation coverage for Garcia in Puerto Rico because less than 50% of his worktime was spent there.  The airline thus was free to insure its employees elsewhere and, because Garcia had received substantial benefits under the Florida statute--indeed, higher benefits than would have been available in Puerto Rico--American was immunized from further liability by that act's exclusive remedy provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Second, the airline argued that, to the extent statutory immunity was not dispositive, the matter raised an arbitrable minor dispute over which the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to the federal Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. Secs. 151-188.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the complaint on statutory immunity grounds, ruling that Puerto Rico would give effect to the exclusive remedy provision contained in the Florida workers' compensation act.

Thus, Garcia's receipt of benefits from Florida does not automatically preclude an effort to obtain additional benefits through his tort action in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually all workers' compensation statutes, however, contain an exclusive remedy provision, stating that an award of statutory benefits forecloses any other type of compensation for the injury, including damages in tort.  Workmen's Compensation Law, Sec. 88.10, at 16-171.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Employees trade their tort remedies \"for a system of compensation without contest, thus sparing [them] the cost, delay and uncertainty of a claim in litigation.\"  Mullarkey v.

Conversely, workers' compensation statutes typically allow a damages remedy against employers who fail to assume the statutory compensation burdens.  The theory behind these provisions is self-evident.  An employer who avoids sharing in the burdens of the system is not entitled to enjoy its primary benefit, the immunity from non-statutory liability.  Florida's and Puerto Rico's statutes each have both types of provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves a head-on collision between the employee's right to successive workers' compensation remedies and the immunity granted by individual jurisdictions to employers who participate in their own workers' compensation programs.  Specifically, Garcia claims that he is entitled to bring a damages suit in Puerto Rico--where American was not insured--despite the statutory immunity conferred on the airline in Florida--where it was insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia's argument rests on several related contentions:  (1) that the Florida workers' compensation act is inapplicable to his injury because no Florida interests were implicated;  (2) that American was obligated to insure him under the Commonwealth's compensation scheme because he is a Puerto Rico resident whose job is based there;  (3) and, finally, that the inapplicability of the Florida statute renders its exclusive remedy limitation impotent, while the neglected obligation under Puerto Rico law empowers him to sue American for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that each of these premises is flawed.  As a result, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Garcia's tort action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Applicability of Florida law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to remember, as noted above, that more than one workers' compensation statute can apply to a single compensable injury, so long as each state has a \"more-than-casual\" interest in the case.  4 Workmen's Compensation Law Sec. 86.00, at 16-48.  Florida law may apply to Garcia's injury, therefore, even if another state--or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico--has more substantial interests in his claim.  \"[T]he test is not whether [Florida]'s interest is greater than that of any other state, but only whether [Florida] has a valid interest.\"   Id. Sec. 86.34, at 16-60 (citing Dissell v. Trans World Airlines, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></span>, 444-45 &amp; n. 3 (Me.1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia claims that Florida law is wholly inapplicable to his injury, and that the exclusive remedy provision contained in the Florida workers' compensation statute therefore may not be invoked to bar his damages lawsuit in Puerto Rico.  Florida law does not apply, he claims, because neither he, his job, nor his injury has a Florida connection.  He emphasizes that he is a Puerto Rico resident based in Puerto Rico;  that he entered into his employment relationship with the airline, a Delaware corporation, in Texas;  and injured himself while traveling between San Juan and Newark, New Jersey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his argument, Garcia relies heavily on a Florida Supreme Court case, Wainwright v. Wainwright, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span> (1970), in which a Georgia resident employed by a Georgia corporation sought benefits under the Florida workers' compensation statute for an injury suffered in Georgia.  The court upheld the administrative denial of the claim and, in the course of its opinion, noted that the statute could not be applied \"to other states in which ... the State of Florida has no interest and to cases over which the State of Florida has no authority,\" id. at 156.   Garcia maintains that the same factors upon which the Florida Supreme Court relied to reject the claim in Wainwright exist here:  an extraterritorial injury to a non-resident employee working for an out-of-state employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia's argument, and his reliance on Wainwright, are misplaced.  Unlike in Wainwright, neither the employer's business nor the employee's work are located exclusively outside Florida.  American Airlines operates in Florida, and Garcia worked on flights into and out of at least two Florida cities.  See Sworn Statement of Jorge Olascoaga, Flight Service Supervisor, at 6.  Although Garcia is correct that Florida's contacts with his injury are limited, this is at least in part because of the inherently mobile nature of both his job and American's business.  The airline has 21,000 flight attendants spread across the country, and no single state has a substantial relationship with all of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if these contacts were deemed insufficient to trigger the coverage provisions of the Florida act directly, Garcia nevertheless would be covered because of American's voluntary assumption of liability under the Florida system.  The Florida statute permits an otherwise excluded employer to waive the exclusion and bring itself or a specific injury within the act's coverage by choosing to participate in the Florida worker's compensation scheme.  See Fla.Stat.Ann. Sec. 440.04(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Mandico v.

For more than a decade before Garcia's accident, American voluntarily provided accident insurance for its employees in Florida, and, in this case, it specifically facilitated Garcia's application for benefits by providing him with the required form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more to the point, we think it decidedly inequitable for Garcia to claim that Florida law is inapplicable now that he has received all the benefits that law provides.  Workers' compensation systems are designed around a quid pro quo:  employees secure \"a practical and expeditious remedy for their industrial accidents,\" Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104391\"><a href=\"/opinion/104391/cardillo-v-liberty-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 476, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104391\"><a href=\"/opinion/104391/cardillo-v-liberty-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></a></span> (1947), while employers secure \"a limited and determinate liability,\" id.   Unlike in Wainwright, where the employer and the Florida Industrial Claims Commission both denied the employee's claim for benefits, Garcia has received substantial compensation under the Florida scheme.  Indeed, it is undisputed that the compensation he received exceeds the benefits to which he would have been entitled under Puerto Rico law.  Garcia makes no offer to return the Florida benefits.  Having acquiesced in the applicability of Florida law when it suited his interest, Garcia cannot fairly be allowed to disclaim its application now.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining that Florida law may be applied does not lead inevitably, however, to the conclusion that the present action is barred by the exclusive remedy provision in Florida's compensation act.  The Supreme Court repeatedly has rejected the notion that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution requires a second jurisdiction to defer to limiting provisions contained in the workers' compensation legislation of the jurisdiction in which an injured worker first received benefits.  4 Workmen's Compensation Law Sec. 88.12, at 16-183.  See Thomas, 448 U.S. at 279-80, 284-86, 100 S.Ct. at 2659-60;  Carroll v.

This means that Garcia not only is permitted to seek additional benefits, but also that Puerto Rico is free to disregard Florida's exclusive remedy provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a worker's second claim is for common-law damages rather than additional benefits, however, most states, on grounds of comity and policy, will respect the other jurisdiction's exclusive remedy provision immunizing the employer from non-statutory liability.  4 Workmen's Compensation Law, Secs. 88.00, 88.10, at 16-171-183 (citing cases);  see, e.g., Kelly v. Guyon Gen. Piping, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527596\"><a href=\"/opinion/527596/joseph-e-kelly-v-guyon-general-piping-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 110 (4th Cir.1989);  Woodner v.

The rationale underlying this uniform treatment is compelling.  The central purpose of compensation acts is \"to substitute a limited but certain remedy for the former remedy in tort--a compromise benefiting both employer and employee.\"   4 Workmen's Compensation Law, at Sec. 88.13, at 16-187 (citing Wilson v.

When an employee who has received benefits under such a compensation scheme later tries to get back into the common-law damage system, he is essentially un-doing this fundamental quid pro quo.  See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws Secs. 183, 184 (1971).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Courts that give effect to foreign exclusive remedy provisions therefore do so to effectuate broad compensation principles.

Applying Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia claims that Puerto Rico law requires American Airlines to participate in the Commonwealth's insurance fund, and that the airline's failure to do so makes it an uninsured employer subject to a tort suit under section 16 of the Puerto Rico Workmen's Accident Compensation Act, 11 P.R. Laws Ann. Sec. 16.  His receipt of benefits from Florida does not foreclose such a suit, Garcia maintains, in light of \"the Commonwealth's unequivocal policy that all employers carrying business in Puerto Rico must contribute to the financial feasibility of the Fund.\"   He asserts that allowing employers to escape liability by obtaining insurance elsewhere would undermine the Commonwealth's compensation framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In emphasizing Commonwealth policy, Garcia has put his best foot forward.  Courts that have rejected application of a foreign state's exclusive remedy provision have done so because the forum state's policy would be disadvantaged.  See, e.g., Reid v. Hansen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2052245\"><a href=\"/opinion/2052245/reid-v-hansen/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 601-02 (Iowa 1989) (plaintiff's receipt of benefits in Nebraska does not bar tort action under Iowa statute);  Davis v.

Puerto Rico's workers' compensation act, like all such laws, reflects a primary interest in ensuring that the burden resulting from an employee's work-related injury falls upon his employer rather than the individual or his community.  See, e.g., Crider v. Zurich Ins.

As the district court recognized, this interest \"has been amply satisfied by the benefits Garcia received through Florida's workers' accident compensation system\"--benefits exceeding those available under the Puerto Rico statute.  Puerto Rico's policy, like Florida's, immunizes employers who pay statutory benefits from further liability.  P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 11, Sec. 21.  Because the two governments agree on the compensation quid pro quo, Puerto Rico would have no reason to reject Florida's exclusive remedy provision unless it had an interest in providing an incentive for American and similar employers to insure their employees specifically in the Commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reading of Puerto Rico policy, however, indicates that the Commonwealth expressly has disclaimed an interest in covering employees who do most of their work outside Puerto Rico.  In an opinion and subsequent explanatory letter, the Commonwealth's Secretary of Justice concluded that flight attendants who perform more than 50% of their work elsewhere are excluded from the coverage of the Commonwealth's labor laws and Section 16 of the Bill of Rights of the Puerto Rico Constitution, which guarantees various employment-related rights, including safe working conditions and a reasonable minimum salary.

The Secretary's intent that his determination be applied broadly is strongly suggested by the explanatory letter, in which he concluded that even employees of a Puerto Rico airline are excluded from coverage of the Commonwealth's labor laws because they spend the majority of their work time outside the jurisdictional limits of Puerto Rico.  See Letter of Dec. 28, 1977, Trans., at 2.

In rejecting the request for benefits in Wainwright, the Judge of Industrial Claims made a specific finding that there was no waiver, and the state supreme court held that competent substantial evidence supported that ruling.  237 So.2d at 156-57</p>\n        <p>Moreover, in light of Garcia's acceptance of undisputed benefits, we see no reason to dwell on the substantiality of Florida's relationship to the injury.  Given the policy of successive awards, the only relevant concern is whether Florida's exercise of jurisdiction would compromise the law of another jurisdiction with more substantial contacts, in violation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution.
