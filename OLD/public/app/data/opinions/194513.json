Defendant-appellant Michael\n                              \n\nIdowu  Tunde  Akinola  (\"Akinola\")  launches  a  five-pronged\n\nattack  on  his conviction  for  conspiracy  to possess  with\n\nintent  to distribute  heroin and  possession with  intent to\n\ndistribute heroin.1  We  address the following claimed errors\n\nin detail:  1) unconstitutional denial of chosen counsel when\n\nthe Magistrate Judge denied  his desired counsel's motion for\n\nadmission pro hac vice; 2) erroneous denial of his motion for\n                      \n\njudgment  of acquittal;  3)  the impermissible  prosecutorial\n\ncomment  on  his failure  to  testify and  the  trial court's\n\nsubsequent  inadequate curative instruction; and 4) the trial\n\ncourt's improper jury instruction.  For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we affirm both counts of conviction.  \n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      Factual Background\n                                        \n\n          We begin  by summarizing the evidence  in the light\n\nmost  favorable to the  government.  United  States v. Abreu,\n                                                            \n\n952 F.2d 1458, 1460  (1st Cir.), cert. denied,      U.S.    ,\n                                                            \n\n112 S. Ct. 1695 (1992).\n\n          On June 30,  1991, Patrolman Donald L. Mong  of the\n\nEast Greenwich, Rhode Island,  Police Department, was working\n\na routine patrol  in a  marked cruiser.   At approximately  5\n\n                    \n\n1.  Akinola was  arrested, tried  and convicted along  with a\nco-defendant, Joseph  Gullity, whose  appeal we  have already\ndecided.   United States  v. Gullity, No.  92-1586 (1st  Cir.\n                                    \nDec. 14, 1992) (unpublished).\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\np.m.,  Mong  noticed  that  a  car   which  had  just  passed\n\nperpendicular to his (\"the suspect car\") did not have a front\n\nlicense  plate. Mong  and  Akinola made  eye  contact as  the\n\nsuspect car passed Mong.  Mong pulled out and began to follow\n\nthe  vehicle, in which Akinola was the driver and Gullity the\n\npassenger.   When Mong positioned himself  behind the suspect\n\ncar,  it  accelerated and  began  to  pull  away  from  Mong,\n\neventually  reaching  a  speed of  50  miles  per  hour in  a\n\nresidential area posted for  25 miles per hour.   Mong closed\n\nthe gap sufficiently so that he could read the vehicle's rear\n\nlicense   plate  number   which  he  transmitted   to  police\n\nheadquarters in order to obtain as much information about the\n\ncar as possible.\n\n          As appellant's car slowed for intersection traffic,\n\nMong shortened  the distance between  the two  vehicles.   He\n\nthen   observed  Akinola  and   Gullity  having   a  spirited\n\nconversation in which he could see Akinola's  head moving and\n\nhis lips  moving fast \"as though  he was trying to  get out a\n\nlot  of information  quickly.\"   After  traffic cleared,  the\n\nsuspect  car turned  left  at the  intersection, followed  by\n\nMong.  Again, the  suspect car began pulling away  from Mong,\n\ndespite the  latter's speed of  50 miles  per hour.   At that\n\ntime, the two vehicles were travelling in a 35  mile per hour\n\nzone.  The  suspect car  soon approached the  vicinity of  an\n\nentrance ramp for interstate route 95.  Although Mong had yet\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nto receive any information  on the suspect car, he  wanted to\n\navoid following  it onto  the interstate, and  thus activated\n\nhis car's emergency overhead lights.  The suspect car did not\n\nenter the  interstate, nor, however, did it  stop in response\n\nto  the  emergency  lights.   Mong  then  flashed  his  car's\n\nheadlights  and  turned on  his  siren,  after which  Akinola\n\nappeared  to   glance  into   his  rear-view   mirror.  After\n\ntravelling approximately 200  yards further,  and passing  at\n\nleast two  areas suitable for pulling over, Akinola entered a\n\nmovie  theater parking  lot,  stopping the  vehicle near  the\n\nfront of  the theater  entrance.  Between  Mong radioing  for\n\ninformation  and  the  suspect  car  stopping,  the  vehicles\n\ncovered about one and one-half miles.\n\n          As  Mong was  informing  his  dispatcher that  both\n\nvehicles had  stopped, Akinola  exited his vehicle  and began\n\nyelling  at Mong in an  \"agitated\" manner.   Mong then exited\n\nhis vehicle,  while Akinola continued toward  him, yelling at\n\nMong and  toward Gullity--who was still seated in the car--in\n\nEnglish to Mong and to Gullity in another language which Mong\n\ndid  not understand, which later turned out to be the African\n\ndialect Yoruba.   Although Mong ordered Akinola  to return to\n\nhis  car,  Akinola  continued  towards   him,  still  yelling\n\nbilingually.   Akinola then began  shoving Mong, but  after a\n\nscuffle, Mong was able to pin Akinola on the ground, handcuff\n\nhim, and then lock him in the rear of his cruiser.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n     Meanwhile,  during  the Mong-Akinola  imbroglio, Gullity\n\nwalked  into the theater lobby.  After securing Akinola, Mong\n\nbrought Gullity back to the  parking lot, whereupon a citizen\n\nbystander,  Michael Melchor,  directed Mong's attention  to a\n\nnearby  vehicle,  under which  Melchor  claimed  he had  seen\n\nGullity  kick an object he had removed from his shirt pocket.\n\nMong  retrieved the object, which  turned out to  be a tissue\n\ncontaining 46.5  grams of  heroin.  Akinola  was subsequently\n\nindicted and  convicted on  charges of conspiracy  to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute  heroin, in violation of  21 U.S.C.\n\n   841(a)(1),  (b)(1)(c) and 846, and  possession with intent\n\nto distribute heroin, in violation  of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1),\n\n(b)(1)(c).   Following his conviction, he was  sentenced to a\n\nterm of 46 months imprisonment.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                     Pretrial Proceedings\n                                         \n\n          Akinola initially  appeared  in district  court  on\n\nJuly  15, 1991,  at  which time  attorney  John F.  Cicilline\n\nentered an appearance on Akinola's behalf.   A probable cause\n\nand detention hearing  was then scheduled for July  18, 1991.\n\nOn the scheduled date, attorney John M. Cicilline appeared on\n\nbehalf of Gullity, and  attorney David N. Cicilline attempted\n\nto represent Akinola.   John F. Cicilline was not  present at\n\nthe hearing.  Magistrate Judge Boudewyns did not permit David\n\nN. Cicilline to represent Akinola because he was not a member\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nof Rhode Island's District bar and  because John F. Cicilline\n\nwas still listed as  counsel of record and had  not withdrawn\n\nfrom  the case.   The  Magistrate Judge  also denied  John M.\n\nCicilline's motion to admit David N. Cicilline pro hac  vice,\n                                                            \n\nbut  scheduled  a  hearing  for July  23,  1991,  to  further\n\nconsider the matter.\n\n          John F.  Cicilline appeared  at the July  23, 1991,\n\nhearing and requested the  Magistrate Judge to reconsider his\n\ndenial of the pro hac  vice motion.  That request was  denied\n                           \n\nfor  several   reasons,  which  appellant   now  argues  were\n\nerroneous.  We need not address the merits of this particular\n\nclaim, however, because appellant's  failure to preserve  the\n\nissue leaves us without  jurisdiction to consider the matter.\n\nA brief explanation follows.\n\n          The  courts  of   appeals  have  jurisdiction  over\n\nappeals  \"from all final decisions  of the district courts of\n\nthe  United  States.\"   28 U.S.C.     1291; United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nEcker, 923 F.2d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1991).  Furthermore, \"[t]o  be\n     \n\na final order  of the  district court within  the meaning  of\n\nsection  1291,  the  magistrate's  decision  must  have  been\n\nreviewed  by  the  district  court,  which  retains  ultimate\n\ndecision-making power.\" Id.  (quoting Siers  v. Morrash,  700\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  113,  115  (3d  Cir. 1983)  and  cases  cited  therein)\n\n(internal quotes  omitted).

It is true, as appellant asserts, that\n\nUnited States  v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1986)\n                                 \n\nmandated such notice in  certain cases to protect  the rights\n\nof  pro se litigants.   But here, Akinola  was represented by\n          \n\nexperienced  counsel at  the time  of the  Magistrate Judge's\n\nruling.  Moreover,  as we pointed  out during oral  argument,\n\neven when such a warning is required, it is necessary only as\n\npart of a Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation to the\n\ndistrict  judge, 28 U.S.C.    636(b)(1)(B), (C), and not when\n\nthe  Magistrate Judge  issues  a non-dispositive  order.   28\n\nU.S.C.   636(b)(1)(A); See,  e.g., M.S. Chambers &amp; Son,  Inc.\n                                                             \n\nv.  Tambrands,  Inc., 118  F.R.D.  274, 279  (D.

In  Ecker we  noted the  existence of  two categories  of\n             \nmagistrate's    orders--\"self-operating\"    and    \"non-self-\noperating.\"  The  former  type,   pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.   \n636(b)(1)(A),  which  cover   most  pre-trial  and  discovery\nmatters,  are valid when entered  and can be  challenged by a\nmotion  for reconsideration directed  to the  district court.\nNon-self-operating orders  are not  valid until  the district\ncourt accepts the magistrate's report and recommendation  and\nenters an order or judgment.  28 U.S.C.   636(b)(1)(A), (B).\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nruling  may  be  considered  a report  and  recommendation\").\n\nTherefore, the lack of such notice in this case is of no help\n\nto  appellant,  and  thus  we  are  without  jurisdiction  to\n\nconsider the Magistrate's pro hac vice ruling.\n                                      \n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                     Alleged Trial Errors\n                                         \n\nA.

If, upon such a reading  of the record, we\n\nconclude that a  rational jury could have found the defendant\n                                    \n\nguilty  beyond a reasonable  doubt, then  we must  affirm the\n\ndistrict court.

Vargas,  945 F.2d  426,  428 (1st  Cir.  1991) (citations\n          \n\nomitted). \n\n          The  government  concedes  that  it  has  no direct\n\nevidence  of  Akinola's  actual  possession  of  the  heroin.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nInstead, the case against Akinola is  based on an inferential\n\nchain of circumstantial evidence.  The government argues that\n\nAkinola's actions  after he  became aware of  Mong's presence\n\nall  support  the conclusion  that  he had  knowledge  of the\n\nheroin  in Gullity's  pocket.   Specifically,  the government\n\nrelies on Mong's testimony  that Akinola suddenly accelerated\n\nafter he and  Mong made initial eye contact, speeding through\n\na residential neighborhood at twice the speed  limit.  Later,\n\nwhen Akinola was forced  to slow for traffic, he  and Gullity\n\nwere seen  in an animated conversation,  which the government\n\nclaims related  to the heroin and  what to do in  the face of\n\nMong's presence.   Next,  the government points  to Akinola's\n\nfailure to yield after Mong activated his lights and  sirens,\n\npassing at  least two  suitable turnoffs before  pulling into\n\nthe  movie  theater  parking  lot,  as  further  evidence  of\n\nevasion.   In addition, the government  argues that Akinola's\n\nphysical  assault  on  Mong  was  an  attempt at  creating  a\n\ndiversion  so  that  Gullity  could dispose  of  the  heroin.\n\nFinally, the  government claims that Akinola  was shouting to\n\nGullity in  the  Yoruba language  in  order to  give  Gullity\n\ninstructions which Mong  would be unable to  understand.  The\n\ngovernment  argues  that Akinola  was instructing  Gullity to\n\ndispose   of   the   heroin,   which   Gullity  did,   albeit\n\nunsuccessfully.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          Appellant  contends  that any  inference  of either\n\nknowledge  or  dominion  and  control drawn  from  the  above\n\ndescribed  events  is  nothing  more  than  rank speculation,\n\nresulting  from the  government's attempt to  \"pile inference\n\nupon  inference.\"  Although this  is a close  case, we reject\n\nappellant's exhortations.\n\n          Based on the evidence  of Akinola's evasive actions\n\nfollowing the initial contact with Mong, the jury could infer\n\nthat he knew of the heroin in Gullity's pocket.  Further, the\n\njury could conclude that the pair's animated conversation was\n\na  reflection   of  Akinola's   knowledge   of  the   heroin.\n\nAdditionally,  a rational  jury could conclude that Akinola's\n\ninitiation  of physical  conflict with  Mong was  a diversion\n\nintended  to allow Gullity to  get away with,  or dispose of,\n\nthe  heroin.  The jury  could have also  found that Akinola's\n\nYoruban communication to Gullity related to the heroin, given\n\nthe   temporal  proximity  between   Akinola's  actions,  his\n\nunprovoked  assault on Mong, the communication, and Gullity's\n\nactions.   Moreover,  the same  events could  lead a  jury to\n\nconclude  that  Akinola--through  Gullity--was attempting  to\n\nexercise his dominion and control  over the heroin.  Finally,\n\nevidence  indicated  that the  amount  of  heroin seized  was\n\nequivalent  to  2,300  doses.     That  fact,  combined  with\n\ntestimony to the effect that neither Akinola nor Gullity were\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nheroin  users,  supports a  conclusion  that  the heroin  was\n\nintended for distribution.  See Vargas, 945 F.2d at 428-29.\n                                      \n\n          With  respect to  appellant's  claim of  inference-\n\npiling,  we recall, as we did in  a recent case, the words of\n\nJudge Aldrich:\n\n               The  rule is  not that  an inference,  no\n          matter how reasonable, is to be rejected if it\n          in  turn  depends   upon  another   reasonable\n          inference; rather, the question is whether the\n          total    evidence,     including    reasonable\n          inferences, when put together is sufficient to\n          warrant  a jury to  conclude that defendant is\n          guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnited  States v.

Based  on the foregoing, we\n\nfind the evidence of Akinola's constructive possession of the\n\nheroin is sufficient to sustain his conviction for possession\n\nwith intent to distribute heroin.\n\n     2.

In\n\naddition, the  government must show Akinola's  intent to both\n\nagree with his co-conspirator,  and to commit the substantive\n\noffense.

We disagree that the evidence in this case supports\n\na finding of  no more  than that Akinola  was merely  present\n\nwith Gullity.\n\n          As we have already noted, the jury could have found\n\nthat Akinola  knew of  the  heroin prior  to Mong's  presence\n\nbased on  his sudden acceleration at  the sight of Mong.   In\n\naddition, the animated conversation and  Akinola's actions in\n\nthe parking  lot, when  he first  shouted toward Gullity  and\n\nthen  attempted  to  create  a diversion  for  him,  could be\n\nindicative  of the  existence of  an agreement  between them.\n\nThis  is  especially  true  since the  parking  lot  incident\n\noccurred  soon  after  their  animated   conversation,  which\n\noccurred  after  Mong  had  been  following  for  some  time.\n\nAlthough this count, too, presents a close call,  we conclude\n\nthat a  rational jury  could reasonably infer  from Akinola's\n\nactions the existence of an agreement with Gullity to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute the heroin.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nB.

And  we do\n          that by  showing a  high speed chase,  an\n          animated   conversation,  a   failure  to\n          yield, an unprovoked physical assault and\n          yelling  in a foreign  language which are\n                                                   \n          unexplained   by   anything  other   than\n                                     \n          knowledge  of  the  heroin  in  the  car.\n\n          (emphasis added)\n\nDefense counsel  objected, on  the basis that  the emphasized\n\nportion of the argument  constituted impermissible comment on\n\nAkinola's  failure to  testify.   The  trial court  initially\n\noverruled  the  objection, but  then,  sua  sponte, gave  the\n                                                  \n\nfollowing instruction to the jury:\n\n          Excuse me.   I  don't  mean to  interpret\n          (sic) you, Mr. Sullivan.  Let me make one\n          thing clear to  the jury.  I am  sure Mr.\n          Sullivan  says  unexplained,  what he  is\n          referring to is  unexplained by the facts\n          that have  been presented  to you.

We disagree.\n\n          It is beyond question that comment on a defendant's\n\nfailure  to  testify  is  violative of  the  Fifth  Amendment\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nguarantee against self-incrimination.

Dec. 4, 1992).\n\n          Having read the challenged  comment in the  context\n\nof the entire closing argument, we are satisfied that the use\n\nof the word \"unexplained\", while perhaps unfortunate, did not\n\nstray  into forbidden territory nor was it intended to do so.\n\nInstead, consistent  with  the circumstantial  nature of  the\n\ncase, the prosecutor recounted each of the events culminating\n\nin Akinola's arrest, and followed  each by suggesting to  the\n\njury   the  government-preferred   inference.3     In   using\n\n                    \n\n3.  Some examples include, \"The  only reason Akinola did that\nwas  his  knowledge  of  the  heroin;\"  \"There  is  no  other\nplausible explanation for Akinola jumping out of the car.\" \n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n\"unexplained,\" the prosecutor was attempting to reinforce his\n\nthesis that  Akinola's actions  could only be  interpreted in\n                                                          \n\none way, and could not  logically be consistent with anything\n\nexcept Akinola's guilt.\n\n          The   prosecutor's   comments  here   are  somewhat\n\nreminiscent  of those in United States  v. Skandier, 758 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n43  (1st  Cir.  1985),  where the  prosecutor  concluded  his\n\nargument by saying:\n\n          [I] will have a  chance to speak with you\n          one   more  time  and   see  if  [defense\n          counsel] can explain the story that would\n          be  any  different  with  regard  to  the\n          responsibility of the  defendant in  this\n          case.  So I submit to you that he cannot.\n\nId. at 45.\n   \n\nWe concluded that such a \"`how-does-he-explain'\" argument was\n\nimproper  for two reasons--the Fifth Amendment transgression,\n\nand  the apparent  shift  of  the  burden  of  proof  to  the\n\ndefendant. Id.   In  reaching that  conclusion, we  relied in\n              \n\npart  on United  States v.  Wilkins, 659  F.2d 769,  774 (7th\n                                   \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S.  1102 (1981), wherein the court\n                   \n\nheld  that the prosecutor's  statements that the government's\n\ntheory was  the \"only explanation\" and  \"[s]ee if defendant's\n\nattorney explains ... \"  were improper comment on defendant's\n\nfailure   to  testify.     Unlike   Skandier,   however,  the\n                                            \n\nprosecutor's remark  here was clearly aimed  at the evidence,\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nrather than at the defendant.  Thus, we find that the comment\n\nhere at issue did not run roughshod over Akinola's rights.4 \n\nC.  Final Jury Instructions\n                           \n\n          Appellant assigns two  errors to the  trial court's\n\nfinal instructions.   First, appellant argues  that the trial\n\ncourt  neglected   to  explain  that  while   it  might  draw\n\ninferences  from     circumstantial  evidence,  it   was  not\n\npermitted  to engage in  speculation or conjecture  to do so.\n\nHowever, at  the close  of trial,  the  judge instructed  the\n\njury, inter alia, to \n                \n\n          Bear  in mind  though, as I  said before,\n          that in order  to draw such an  inference\n          [from  circumstantial evidence]  you have\n          to be  careful  that the  inference is  a\n          reasonable  one and  that it  is directly\n          based on  facts that have  been proven by\n          the  direct  evidence,  the testimony  of\n          witnesses or exhibits.\n\nHaving read the instructions in their entirety, including the\n\nabove-quoted section, we conclude  that while the trial court\n\ndid  not use  appellant's suggested  words, the  jury members\n\n                    \n\n4.  We note further that while the court's immediate curative\ninstruction  dealt with the burden of proof shift and made no\nmention of the Fifth Amendment, the court twice gave the jury\nFifth  Amendment instructions,  including  once  just  before\ndeliberations.  Based on that combination of instructions, we\nare satisfied that any error was rendered  harmless.  Indeed,\nin a  close case such as  this, it is the  combination of the\ntrial judge's  instructions, and not the  \"strong evidence of\ndefendant's  guilt\"--as  described  by  the  government--that\nwould  render the  prosecutor's putative  violation harmless.\nCf.  Lilly, slip  op.  at 19  (strength of  government's case\n          \ncontributed  to  rendering   harmless  potentially   improper\nprosecutorial comment); Skandier, 758 F.2d at 46 (same).\n                                \n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nwere  adequately apprised  of  the proper  legal standard  to\n\nemploy.

Appellant argues that the trial court's failure to\n\nuse \"must  not\" in  those circumstances is  reversible error.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n     After  defense  counsel  objected  to the  \"ought  not\"-\n\n\"should-not\" charge,  the  judge supplemented  his charge  by\n\ntelling  the jury, in effect, that he used the terms \"ought,\"\n\n\"should,\" and \"must\" interchangeably, and therefore, where he\n\nsaid that something should  not be done, he meant it must not\n                                                             \n\nbe done.

Mong  of the\n\nEast Greenwich, Rhode Island,  Police Department, was working\n\na routine patrol  in a  marked cruiser.   At approximately  5\n\n                    \n\n1.  Akinola was  arrested, tried  and convicted along  with a\nco-defendant, Joseph  Gullity, whose  appeal we  have already\ndecided.   United States  v. Gullity, No.  92-1586 (1st  Cir.\n                                    \nDec. 14, 1992) (unpublished).\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\np.m.,  Mong  noticed  that  a  car   which  had  just  passed\n\nperpendicular to his (\"the suspect car\") did not have a front\n\nlicense  plate. Mong  and  Akinola made  eye  contact as  the\n\nsuspect car passed Mong.  Mong pulled out and began to follow\n\nthe  vehicle, in which Akinola was the driver and Gullity the\n\npassenger.   When Mong positioned himself  behind the suspect\n\ncar,  it  accelerated and  began  to  pull  away  from  Mong,\n\neventually  reaching  a  speed of  50  miles  per  hour in  a\n\nresidential area posted for  25 miles per hour.   Mong closed\n\nthe gap sufficiently so that he could read the vehicle's rear\n\nlicense   plate  number   which  he  transmitted   to  police\n\nheadquarters in order to obtain as much information about the\n\ncar as possible.\n\n          As appellant's car slowed for intersection traffic,\n\nMong shortened  the distance between  the two  vehicles.   He\n\nthen   observed  Akinola  and   Gullity  having   a  spirited\n\nconversation in which he could see Akinola's  head moving and\n\nhis lips  moving fast \"as though  he was trying to  get out a\n\nlot  of information  quickly.\"   After  traffic cleared,  the\n\nsuspect  car turned  left  at the  intersection, followed  by\n\nMong.  Again, the  suspect car began pulling away  from Mong,\n\ndespite the  latter's speed of  50 miles  per hour.   At that\n\ntime, the two vehicles were travelling in a 35  mile per hour\n\nzone.  The  suspect car  soon approached the  vicinity of  an\n\nentrance ramp for interstate route 95.  Although Mong had yet\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nto receive any information  on the suspect car, he  wanted to\n\navoid following  it onto  the interstate, and  thus activated\n\nhis car's emergency overhead lights.  The suspect car did not\n\nenter the  interstate, nor, however, did it  stop in response\n\nto  the  emergency  lights.   Mong  then  flashed  his  car's\n\nheadlights  and  turned on  his  siren,  after which  Akinola\n\nappeared  to   glance  into   his  rear-view   mirror.  After\n\ntravelling approximately 200  yards further,  and passing  at\n\nleast two  areas suitable for pulling over, Akinola entered a\n\nmovie  theater parking  lot,  stopping the  vehicle near  the\n\nfront of  the theater  entrance.  Between  Mong radioing  for\n\ninformation  and  the  suspect  car  stopping,  the  vehicles\n\ncovered about one and one-half miles.\n\n          As  Mong was  informing  his  dispatcher that  both\n\nvehicles had  stopped, Akinola  exited his vehicle  and began\n\nyelling  at Mong in an  \"agitated\" manner.   Mong then exited\n\nhis vehicle,  while Akinola continued toward  him, yelling at\n\nMong and  toward Gullity--who was still seated in the car--in\n\nEnglish to Mong and to Gullity in another language which Mong\n\ndid  not understand, which later turned out to be the African\n\ndialect Yoruba.   Although Mong ordered Akinola  to return to\n\nhis  car,  Akinola  continued  towards   him,  still  yelling\n\nbilingually.   Akinola then began  shoving Mong, but  after a\n\nscuffle, Mong was able to pin Akinola on the ground, handcuff\n\nhim, and then lock him in the rear of his cruiser.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n     Meanwhile,  during  the Mong-Akinola  imbroglio, Gullity\n\nwalked  into the theater lobby.  After securing Akinola, Mong\n\nbrought Gullity back to the  parking lot, whereupon a citizen\n\nbystander,  Michael Melchor,  directed Mong's attention  to a\n\nnearby  vehicle,  under which  Melchor  claimed  he had  seen\n\nGullity  kick an object he had removed from his shirt pocket.\n\nMong  retrieved the object, which  turned out to  be a tissue\n\ncontaining 46.5  grams of  heroin.  Akinola  was subsequently\n\nindicted and  convicted on  charges of conspiracy  to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute  heroin, in violation of  21 U.S.C.\n\n   841(a)(1),  (b)(1)(c) and 846, and  possession with intent\n\nto distribute heroin, in violation  of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1),\n\n(b)(1)(c).   Following his conviction, he was  sentenced to a\n\nterm of 46 months imprisonment.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                     Pretrial Proceedings\n                                         \n\n          Akinola initially  appeared  in district  court  on\n\nJuly  15, 1991,  at  which time  attorney  John F.  Cicilline\n\nentered an appearance on Akinola's behalf.   A probable cause\n\nand detention hearing  was then scheduled for July  18, 1991.\n\nOn the scheduled date, attorney John M. Cicilline appeared on\n\nbehalf of Gullity, and  attorney David N. Cicilline attempted\n\nto represent Akinola.   John F. Cicilline was not  present at\n\nthe hearing.  Magistrate Judge Boudewyns did not permit David\n\nN. Cicilline to represent Akinola because he was not a member\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nof Rhode Island's District bar and  because John F. Cicilline\n\nwas still listed as  counsel of record and had  not withdrawn\n\nfrom  the case.   The  Magistrate Judge  also denied  John M.\n\nCicilline's motion to admit David N. Cicilline pro hac  vice,\n                                                            \n\nbut  scheduled  a  hearing  for July  23,  1991,  to  further\n\nconsider the matter.\n\n          John F.  Cicilline appeared  at the July  23, 1991,\n\nhearing and requested the  Magistrate Judge to reconsider his\n\ndenial of the pro hac  vice motion.  That request was  denied\n                           \n\nfor  several   reasons,  which  appellant   now  argues  were\n\nerroneous.

The government argues that\n\nAkinola's actions  after he  became aware of  Mong's presence\n\nall  support  the conclusion  that  he had  knowledge  of the\n\nheroin  in Gullity's  pocket.   Specifically,  the government\n\nrelies on Mong's testimony  that Akinola suddenly accelerated\n\nafter he and  Mong made initial eye contact, speeding through\n\na residential neighborhood at twice the speed  limit.  Later,\n\nwhen Akinola was forced  to slow for traffic, he  and Gullity\n\nwere seen  in an animated conversation,  which the government\n\nclaims related  to the heroin and  what to do in  the face of\n\nMong's presence.   Next,  the government points  to Akinola's\n\nfailure to yield after Mong activated his lights and  sirens,\n\npassing at  least two  suitable turnoffs before  pulling into\n\nthe  movie  theater  parking  lot,  as  further  evidence  of\n\nevasion.   In addition, the government  argues that Akinola's\n\nphysical  assault  on  Mong  was  an  attempt at  creating  a\n\ndiversion  so  that  Gullity  could dispose  of  the  heroin.\n\nFinally, the  government claims that Akinola  was shouting to\n\nGullity in  the  Yoruba language  in  order to  give  Gullity\n\ninstructions which Mong  would be unable to  understand.  The\n\ngovernment  argues  that Akinola  was instructing  Gullity to\n\ndispose   of   the   heroin,   which   Gullity  did,   albeit\n\nunsuccessfully.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          Appellant  contends  that any  inference  of either\n\nknowledge  or  dominion  and  control drawn  from  the  above\n\ndescribed  events  is  nothing  more  than  rank speculation,\n\nresulting  from the  government's attempt to  \"pile inference\n\nupon  inference.\"  Although this  is a close  case, we reject\n\nappellant's exhortations.\n\n          Based on the evidence  of Akinola's evasive actions\n\nfollowing the initial contact with Mong, the jury could infer\n\nthat he knew of the heroin in Gullity's pocket.  Further, the\n\njury could conclude that the pair's animated conversation was\n\na  reflection   of  Akinola's   knowledge   of  the   heroin.\n\nAdditionally,  a rational  jury could conclude that Akinola's\n\ninitiation  of physical  conflict with  Mong was  a diversion\n\nintended  to allow Gullity to  get away with,  or dispose of,\n\nthe  heroin.  The jury  could have also  found that Akinola's\n\nYoruban communication to Gullity related to the heroin, given\n\nthe   temporal  proximity  between   Akinola's  actions,  his\n\nunprovoked  assault on Mong, the communication, and Gullity's\n\nactions.   Moreover,  the same  events could  lead a  jury to\n\nconclude  that  Akinola--through  Gullity--was attempting  to\n\nexercise his dominion and control  over the heroin.  Finally,\n\nevidence  indicated  that the  amount  of  heroin seized  was\n\nequivalent  to  2,300  doses.     That  fact,  combined  with\n\ntestimony to the effect that neither Akinola nor Gullity were\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nheroin  users,  supports a  conclusion  that  the heroin  was\n\nintended for distribution.  See Vargas, 945 F.2d at 428-29.\n                                      \n\n          With  respect to  appellant's  claim of  inference-\n\npiling,  we recall, as we did in  a recent case, the words of\n\nJudge Aldrich:\n\n               The  rule is  not that  an inference,  no\n          matter how reasonable, is to be rejected if it\n          in  turn  depends   upon  another   reasonable\n          inference; rather, the question is whether the\n          total    evidence,     including    reasonable\n          inferences, when put together is sufficient to\n          warrant  a jury to  conclude that defendant is\n          guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnited  States v.

Based  on the foregoing, we\n\nfind the evidence of Akinola's constructive possession of the\n\nheroin is sufficient to sustain his conviction for possession\n\nwith intent to distribute heroin.\n\n     2.

In\n\naddition, the  government must show Akinola's  intent to both\n\nagree with his co-conspirator,  and to commit the substantive\n\noffense.

We disagree that the evidence in this case supports\n\na finding of  no more  than that Akinola  was merely  present\n\nwith Gullity.\n\n          As we have already noted, the jury could have found\n\nthat Akinola  knew of  the  heroin prior  to Mong's  presence\n\nbased on  his sudden acceleration at  the sight of Mong.   In\n\naddition, the animated conversation and  Akinola's actions in\n\nthe parking  lot, when  he first  shouted toward Gullity  and\n\nthen  attempted  to  create  a diversion  for  him,  could be\n\nindicative  of the  existence of  an agreement  between them.\n\nThis  is  especially  true  since the  parking  lot  incident\n\noccurred  soon  after  their  animated   conversation,  which\n\noccurred  after  Mong  had  been  following  for  some  time.\n\nAlthough this count, too, presents a close call,  we conclude\n\nthat a  rational jury  could reasonably infer  from Akinola's\n\nactions the existence of an agreement with Gullity to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute the heroin.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nB.

And  we do\n          that by  showing a  high speed chase,  an\n          animated   conversation,  a   failure  to\n          yield, an unprovoked physical assault and\n          yelling  in a foreign  language which are\n                                                   \n          unexplained   by   anything  other   than\n                                     \n          knowledge  of  the  heroin  in  the  car.\n\n          (emphasis added)\n\nDefense counsel  objected, on  the basis that  the emphasized\n\nportion of the argument  constituted impermissible comment on\n\nAkinola's  failure to  testify.   The  trial court  initially\n\noverruled  the  objection, but  then,  sua  sponte, gave  the\n                                                  \n\nfollowing instruction to the jury:\n\n          Excuse me.   I  don't  mean to  interpret\n          (sic) you, Mr. Sullivan.  Let me make one\n          thing clear to  the jury.  I am  sure Mr.\n          Sullivan  says  unexplained,  what he  is\n          referring to is  unexplained by the facts\n          that have  been presented  to you.

We disagree.\n\n          It is beyond question that comment on a defendant's\n\nfailure  to  testify  is  violative of  the  Fifth  Amendment\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nguarantee against self-incrimination.

First, appellant argues  that the trial\n\ncourt  neglected   to  explain  that  while   it  might  draw\n\ninferences  from     circumstantial  evidence,  it   was  not\n\npermitted  to engage in  speculation or conjecture  to do so.\n\nHowever, at  the close  of trial,  the  judge instructed  the\n\njury, inter alia, to \n                \n\n          Bear  in mind  though, as I  said before,\n          that in order  to draw such an  inference\n          [from  circumstantial evidence]  you have\n          to be  careful  that the  inference is  a\n          reasonable  one and  that it  is directly\n          based on  facts that have  been proven by\n          the  direct  evidence,  the testimony  of\n          witnesses or exhibits.\n\nHaving read the instructions in their entirety, including the\n\nabove-quoted section, we conclude  that while the trial court\n\ndid  not use  appellant's suggested  words, the  jury members\n\n                    \n\n4.  We note further that while the court's immediate curative\ninstruction  dealt with the burden of proof shift and made no\nmention of the Fifth Amendment, the court twice gave the jury\nFifth  Amendment instructions,  including  once  just  before\ndeliberations.  Based on that combination of instructions, we\nare satisfied that any error was rendered  harmless.  Indeed,\nin a  close case such as  this, it is the  combination of the\ntrial judge's  instructions, and not the  \"strong evidence of\ndefendant's  guilt\"--as  described  by  the  government--that\nwould  render the  prosecutor's putative  violation harmless.\nCf.  Lilly, slip  op.  at 19  (strength of  government's case\n          \ncontributed  to  rendering   harmless  potentially   improper\nprosecutorial comment); Skandier, 758 F.2d at 46 (same).\n                                \n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nwere  adequately apprised  of  the proper  legal standard  to\n\nemploy.

Appellant argues that the trial court's failure to\n\nuse \"must  not\" in  those circumstances is  reversible error.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n     After  defense  counsel  objected  to the  \"ought  not\"-\n\n\"should-not\" charge,  the  judge supplemented  his charge  by\n\ntelling  the jury, in effect, that he used the terms \"ought,\"\n\n\"should,\" and \"must\" interchangeably, and therefore, where he\n\nsaid that something should  not be done, he meant it must not\n                                                             \n\nbe done.
