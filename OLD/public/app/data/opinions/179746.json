This appeal traces its genesis to\n\na fracas at a nightclub.     At this stage of the proceedings, there\n\nis no genuine dispute about the material facts.         We rehearse them\n\nbriefly.\n\n           On the evening of November 23, 2005, plaintiff-appellant\n\nZachary Eaton went to a nightclub in Orono, Maine. Another patron,\n\nnot related to the appellant, behaved inappropriately while dancing\n\nin the mosh pit.     The club's bouncer sought to eject the unruly\n\npatron.    The patron resisted, and the bouncer resorted to force.\n\n           In the course of the ensuing skirmish, the bouncer kicked\n\nopen a glass-and-aluminum door, which struck and injured the\n\nappellant, who was minding his own business.          The parties agree,\n\nfor purposes of this appeal, that the bouncer's actions vis-à-vis\n\nthe unruly patron involved a laying-on of hands and, thus, an\n\nassault.\n\n           On January 11, 2008, the appellant brought suit for\n\ndamages against the proprietor of the club, Albenco, Inc., d/b/a\n\nUshuaia.    In due course, Albenco submitted to judgment in the\n\namount of $125,000, with the understanding that the appellant would\n\nnot seek to satisfy the judgment against Albenco but, rather, would\n\nlook   exclusively   to   Albenco's    insurer   (Penn-America   Insurance\n\nCompany). The appellant subsequently commenced this action against\n\nPenn-America.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f            The district court granted summary judgment in Penn-\n\nAmerica's favor, reasoning that the appellant's claim fell squarely\n\nwithin a policy exclusion.         See Eaton v. United Am. Ins. Group, 685\n\nF. Supp. 2d 154, 159 (D. Me. 2010).                 This timely appeal followed.\n\n            The case is in the federal courts by reason of diversity\n\nof citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite\n\namount.     See     28   U.S.C.    §    1332(a).           Maine    law   supplies     the\n\nsubstantive rules of decision, including the rules relating to\n\ninterpretation of the insurance policy. Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins,\n\n304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938); Med. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Indian Harbor Ins.\n\nCo., 583 F.3d 57, 60 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n            This brief preface brings us to the crux of the matter:\n\ncoverage.   At the time of the fracas, Penn-America insured Albenco\n\nunder a comprehensive general liability policy, in effect for one\n\nyear beginning January 13, 2005.                   The policy afforded coverage,\n\ninter alia, for sums that the insured \"becomes legally obligated to\n\npay as damages\" for \"bodily injury\" arising out of the operation of\n\nthe   insured's     business.          On   the     face    of     things,     then,   the\n\nappellant's damages would appear to come within the scope of the\n\npolicy.\n\n            There    is,   however,         more    to    the    story.      The   policy\n\ncontains a number of exclusions.              We focus here on the assault and\n\nbattery exclusion, which in pertinent part eliminates coverage for\n\n\"damages    resulting       from       assault       or      battery      or    physical\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\faltercations\" that occur in, on, or near the insured's premises.\n\nThe district court found this exclusion dispositive, see Eaton, 685\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 159, and so do we.\n\n             We have explained with a regularity bordering on the\n\necholalic that where a trial court correctly takes the measure of\n\na case and authors a convincing decision, it rarely will serve any\n\nuseful purpose for a reviewing court to wax longiloquent.             See,\n\ne.g., Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, 300 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir.\n\n2002); Maurice v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 235 F.3d 7, 9-10\n\n(1st Cir. 2000); Chico-Vélez v. Roche Prods., Inc., 139 F.3d 56, 58\n\n(1st Cir. 1998); Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas de P.R., 74 F.3d\n\n344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire\n\nLitig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).       Mindful of that precept,\n\nwe affirm the judgment below for substantially the reasons set\n\nforth   in   the   district   court's   rescript.   We   add   only   three\n\ncomments.\n\n             First: The appellant argues that the bouncer's action in\n\nkicking open the door was an independent act, separate from his\n\nassault on the unruly patron.       We disagree.    Because the door was\n\ndislodged in the course of the assault, the appellant's injuries\n\n\"result[ed] from\" the assault and the exclusion applies.\n\n             The appellant's attempt to balkanize a single event by\n\ndividing it into two distinct parts distorts reality.          After all,\n\nthe physical altercation and the opening of the door during and in\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fthe   course   of   that   altercation    were   contemporaneous   and   the\n\nappellant's injuries flowed directly from the altercation.               The\n\naltercation and the dislodgement of the door were not independent\n\nin any meaningful sense. See Winnacunnet Coop. Sch. Dist. v. Nat'l\n\nUnion Fire Ins. Co., 84 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir. 1996).               Thus the\n\nincident falls squarely within the exclusion, which by its terms\n\npertains when an injury \"aris[es] out of\" excluded conduct by the\n\ninsured's employees.\n\n           Second: The appellant asseverates that intent to inflict\n\nhis injuries is a necessary element of an assault and battery, see,\n\ne.g., Bucci v. Essex Ins. Co., 393 F.3d 285, 297 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting Wilson v. State, 268 A.2d 484, 486-87 (Me. 1970)); that\n\nhis injuries occurred inadvertently; and that the absence of intent\n\nrenders the exclusion inapposite.         This asseveration overlooks the\n\nlanguage of the exclusion in two respects.            For one thing, the\n\nexclusion does not target assault and battery in the technical,\n\ncriminal-law sense. Instead, it extends to \"physical altercations\"\n\n— a significantly broader phrase. The appellant's injuries plainly\n\nresulted from just such an altercation.\n\n           For another thing, the text of the exclusion makes\n\nmanifest that it applies to negligent as well as intentional acts.\n\nBy its terms, the exclusion reaches injuries \"caused by or arising\n\nout of negligent . . . conduct by the insured.\"           In other words,\n\nthe policy excludes coverage for damages arising out of physical\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\faltercations even when the perpetrator lacks an assaultive intent\n\nvis-à-vis the injured party.\n\n            Third: We have found a First Circuit case, not cited to\n\nus by either party, that involves a somewhat analogous factual\n\nscenario.    See United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Penuche's, Inc., 128 F.3d\n\n28 (1st Cir. 1997).      There, the injured party, a patron of a bar,\n\nwas assaulted from behind by a fellow patron.               Id. at 30.       An\n\nemployee    of   the    bar,    in     attempting   to   help    the   victim,\n\ninadvertently bumped him.        Id.    The victim fell and hurt himself.\n\nId.   In an ensuing coverage dispute, this court concluded that\n\ncoverage attached.      See id. at 32-33.\n\n            On    closer       examination,     however,        Penuche's   is\n\ndistinguishable.       The policy in force there excluded only \"claims\n\narising out of an assault and/or battery . . . caused by or at the\n\ninstigation of, or at the direction of\" the insured's employees.\n\nId. at 30.       This language is substantially narrower than the\n\nexclusion in Penn-America's policy.           Using this narrow language,\n\nthe Penuche's court, applying New Hampshire law, determined that\n\nthe employee's actions were unintentional with respect to the\n\nvictim and, as such, did not constitute an assault and/or battery.\n\nId. at 32-33.    That is not this case.\n\n            Closer to the point is the decision in First Oak Brook\n\nCorp. v. Comly Holding Corp., 93 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1996).                    The\n\ndispute in that case arose when a customer sustained injuries after\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fa cafe's employees negligently shoved another patron into him. Id.\n\nat 93.   The Third Circuit found the assault and battery exclusion\n\ncontained in the cafe's insurance policy to be dispositive.      See\n\nid. at 95-96.   It based this conclusion on the plain language of\n\nthe exclusion, see id. at 96, which — like the exclusion here —\n\nwent beyond assault and battery simpliciter.1        There are other\n\ncases to the same general effect.     See, e.g., Williamson v. Kovac,\n\n591 So. 2d 788, 791 (La. Ct. App. 1991).\n\n          We need go no further.      For the reasons stated both in\n\nthis opinion and in the opinion below, we reject the appellant's\n\nsuggested interpretation of the exclusion and affirm the judgment\n\nin favor of Penn-America.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       In First Oak Brook Corp., the exclusion applied not only to\nassault and battery but also to \"[h]armful or offensive contact\nbetween or among two or more persons.\" 93 F.3d at 94.\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

At the time of the fracas, Penn-America insured Albenco under a comprehensive general liability policy, in effect for one year beginning January 13, 2005. The policy afforded coverage, inter alia, for sums that the insured \"becomes legally obligated to pay as damages\" for \"bodily injury\" arising out of the operation of the insured's business. On the face of things, then, the appellant's damages would appear to come within the scope of the policy.</p>\n<p>There is, however, more to the story. The policy contains a number of exclusions. We focus here on the assault and battery exclusion, which in pertinent part eliminates coverage for \"damages resulting from assault or battery or physical altercations\" that occur in, on, or near the insured's premises. The district court found this exclusion dispositive, <i>see </i><i>Eaton,</i> 685 F.Supp.2d at 159, and so do we.</p>\n<p>We have explained with a regularity bordering on the echolalic that where a trial court correctly takes the measure of a case and authors a convincing decision, it rarely will serve any useful purpose for a reviewing court to wax longiloquent. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200091\"><a href=\"/opinion/200091/seaco-insurance-co-v-davis-irish/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Maurice v.

Mindful of that precept, we affirm the judgment below for substantially the reasons set forth in the district court's rescript. We add only three comments.</p>\n<p><i>First:</i> The appellant argues that the bouncer's action in kicking open the door was an independent act, separate from his assault on the unruly patron. We disagree. Because the door was dislodged in the course of the assault, the appellant's injuries \"result[ed] from\" the assault and the exclusion applies.</p>\n<p>The appellant's attempt to balkanize a single event by dividing it into two distinct parts distorts reality. After all, the physical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> altercation and the opening of the door during and in the course of that altercation were contemporaneous and the appellant's injuries flowed directly from the altercation. The altercation and the dislodgement of the door were not independent in any meaningful sense. <i>See </i><i>Winnacunnet Coop. Sch. Dist. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196777\"><a href=\"/opinion/196777/winnacunnet-coop-v-national-union-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1996). Thus the incident falls squarely within the exclusion, which by its terms pertains when an injury \"aris[es] out of\" excluded conduct by the insured's employees.</p>\n<p><i>Second:</i> The appellant asseverates that intent to inflict his injuries is a necessary element of an assault and battery, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Bucci v. Essex Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></span>, 297 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Wilson v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></span>, 486-87 (Me.1970)); that his injuries occurred inadvertently; and that the absence of intent renders the exclusion inapposite. This asseveration overlooks the language of the exclusion in two respects. For one thing, the exclusion does not target assault and battery in the technical, criminal-law sense. Instead, it extends to \"physical altercations\"a significantly broader phrase. The appellant's injuries plainly resulted from just such an altercation.</p>\n<p>For another thing, the text of the exclusion makes manifest that it applies to negligent as well as intentional acts. By its terms, the exclusion reaches injuries \"caused by or arising out of negligent ... conduct by the insured.\" In other words, the policy excludes coverage for damages arising out of physical altercations even when the perpetrator lacks an assaultive intent vis-à-vis the injured party.</p>\n<p><i>Third:</i> We have found a First Circuit case, not cited to us by either party, that involves a somewhat analogous factual scenario. <i>See </i><i>United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Penuche's, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197635\"><a href=\"/opinion/197635/insurance-company-v-penuches-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997). There, the injured party, a patron of a bar, was assaulted from behind by a fellow patron. <i>Id.</i> at 30. An employee of the bar, in attempting to help the victim, inadvertently bumped him. <i>Id.</i> The victim fell and hurt himself. <i>Id.</i> In an ensuing coverage dispute, this court concluded that coverage attached. <i>See id.</i> at 32-33.</p>\n<p>On closer examination, however, <i>Penuche's</i> is distinguishable. The policy in force there excluded only \"claims arising out of an assault and/or battery ... caused by or at the instigation of, or at the direction of\" the insured's employees. <i>Id.</i> at 30. This language is substantially narrower than the exclusion in Penn-America's policy. Using this narrow language, the <i>Penuche's</i> court, applying New Hampshire law, determined that the employee's actions were unintentional with respect to the victim and, as such, did not constitute an assault and/or battery. <i>Id.</i> at 32-33. That is not this case.</p>\n<p>Closer to the point is the decision in <i>First Oak Brook Corp. v. Comly Holding Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724877\"><a href=\"/opinion/724877/first-oak-brook-corporation-syndicate-v-the-comly-holding-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1996). The dispute in that case arose when a customer sustained injuries after a cafe's employees negligently shoved another patron into him. <i>Id.</i> at 93. The Third Circuit found the assault and battery exclusion contained in the cafe's insurance policy to be dispositive. <i>See id.</i> at 95-96. It based this conclusion on the plain language of the exclusion, <i>see id.</i> at 96, whichlike the exclusion herewent beyond assault and battery simpliciter.<sup>[1]</sup> There are other cases to the same general effect. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Williamson v. Kovac,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1148657\"><a href=\"/opinion/1148657/williamson-v-kovac/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 791 (La.Ct.App.1991).</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons stated both in this opinion and in the opinion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> below, we reject the appellant's suggested interpretation of the exclusion and affirm the judgment in favor of Penn-America.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In <i>First Oak Brook Corp.,</i> the exclusion applied not only to assault and battery but also to \"[h]armful or offensive contact between or among two or more persons.\" 93 F.3d at 94.</p>\n\n</div>",
