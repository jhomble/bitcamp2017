We have  consolidated three  appeals from\n                \n\nadverse orders in a bankruptcy proceeding in which the debtor\n\nis  Cumberland  Investment  Corporation.   Appellant,  Harold\n\nChorney, was  a principal of the debtor.   Appellee, Eastland\n\nBank (\"Eastland\") is the principal secured creditor. \n\n     One appeal  challenges the  bankruptcy court's  order of\n\nJanuary  17, 1991, denying Chorney's  demand for a  jury in a\n\ncivil  contempt  action.    Another   appeal  challenges  the\n\nbankruptcy court's July 3, 1991 denial of Chorney's motion to\n\nhold the examiner in  contempt.  The third  appeal challenges\n\nthe bankruptcy  judge's August  14, 1991 denial  of Chorney's\n\nmotion that the judge disqualify himself from the case.\n\n      The district court granted  leave to appeal pursuant to\n\nits  discretion to  do  so  under 28  U.S.C.     158(a).   It\n\naffirmed all  three bankruptcy court orders,  and this appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n      Although the  parties have not raised  the issue, \"this\n\ncourt  has  an  obligation to  inquire  sua  sponte  into its\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\"  In re Recticel Foam Corp., 859\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1000,  1002 (1st  Cir. 1988).   Finding no  jurisdiction\n\nover these interlocutory appeals, we must dismiss.  \n\n     Appeal  to  this   court  of  interlocutory  orders   in\n\nbankruptcy  is not permitted by   158, which grants to courts\n\nof  appeals   jurisdiction  only  over   appeals  from  final\n                                                             \n\ndecisions, orders, and decrees.   28 U.S.C.   158(d);  see In\n                                                             \n\nre American  Colonial Broadcasting  Corp., 758 F.2d  794, 800\n                                         \n\n(1st  Cir. 1985).    Because of  the flexible  interpretation\n\naccorded \"finality\"  in bankruptcy cases, this  court has not\n\nruled out the possibility  that a unique case might  arise in\n\nwhich a  district court's  appellate decision under    158(a)\n\nmight be final for purposes of  appeal to this court under   \n\n158(d), despite  the interlocutory  nature of  the underlying\n\nbankruptcy order.   See In  re G.S.F. Corp.,  938 F.2d  1467,\n                                           \n\n1473 (1st  Cir. 1991).  But this is not such an unusual case.\n\n     The orders challenged  here involved interim  procedural\n\nsteps affecting only the  manner in which further proceedings\n\non  the merits would be conducted.  They did not conclusively\n\ndetermine  a \"separable  dispute over  a creditor's  claim or\n\npriority,\"  nor   leave  only   \"ministerial\"  tasks   to  be\n\naccomplished in any  separable judicial  unit or  proceeding.\n\nIn re Saco Local Dev. Corp.,  711 F.2d 441, 445-46 (1st  Cir.\n                           \n\n1983);  see also Tringali v. Hathaway Mach. Co., 796 F.2d 553\n                                               \n\n(1st  Cir. 1986).    Nor  did  the  district  court's  orders\n\nterminate the federal courts' involvement in the entire case,\n\nor  any significant aspect  of it.   In re  G.S.F. Corp., 938\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 1473.   And, based on the partial  record supplied by\n\nappellant,   these  orders  are  not  appealable  \"collateral\n\norders\" under  the doctrine announced in  Cohen v. Beneficial\n                                                             \n\nIndustrial Loan Corp.,  337 U.S.  541 (1949).   There do  not\n                     \n\nappear  to  be  any  \"important and  unsettled  questions  of\n\n                             -3-\n\ncontrolling   law\",   nor   are   the   orders   \"effectively\n\nunreviewable\" on appeal from a final judgment.  United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Sorren, 605  F.2d 1211, 1213 (1st Cir. 1979);  see also In\n                                                             \n\nre M.S.V., Inc., 892 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1989)  (quoting from\n               \n\nCoopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468 (1978)).   \n                            \n\n     The Supreme  Court recently  concluded that 28  U.S.C.  \n\n158  is  not  the exclusive  provision  governing  bankruptcy\n\nappellate  jurisdiction.    In  Connecticut   Nat'l  Bank  v.\n                                                         \n\nGermain, 503 U.S.    , 112 S. Ct. 1146 (1992), the Court held\n       \n\nthat following appeal from an interlocutory bankruptcy  order\n\nto the  district court under    158(a), further discretionary\n\nreview might then be sought in the court of  appeals under 28\n\nU.S.C.    1292(b).  However,  this avenue, too,  is closed to\n\nappellant, as   1292(b)  grants discretionary jurisdiction to\n\nthe court  of appeals only  if the  district court  certifies\n\nthat the case involves  \"a controlling question of law  as to\n\nwhich  there  is  a  substantial  ground  for  difference  of\n\nopinion,\"   and  an   immediate  resolution  by   appeal  may\n\n\"materially   advance\"  the   ultimate  termination   of  the\n\nlitigation.   Although appellant's failure to  expressly seek\n\nsuch a certificate here might be held to be a waiver, we need\n\nnot  decide that question, for contrary to the allowance in  \n\n1292(b), the  district  court expressly  determined that  the\n\nonly legal issues raised were simple, and easily  disposed of\n\n                             -4-\n\non  the merits.1    Finally, as  it  appears that  there  are\n\navailable  adequate alternative appellate  processes, we have\n\nno occasion consider  these appeals under the  All Writs Act,\n\n28 U.S.C.   1651.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons,  these appeals are  dismissed\n                                                             \n\nwithout prejudice.   Since we  have no jurisdiction,  we also\n                                                             \n\ndeny  appellant's motion  to supplement  the record  with new\n                                                             \n\nevidence.   Appellee's  request  for costs  and sanctions  is\n                                                             \n\ndenied.\n       \n\n                    \n\n1.  Unlike 28  U.S.C.   1292(b),   158(a) does not  set forth\nexpress  standards to  guide  the district  court's grant  of\nleave to appeal from an interlocutory bankruptcy order to the\ndistrict court.   In the absence of an  express certification\nunder   1292(b),  then, we  would  not  ordinarily  be  in  a\nposition to conclude  that a district court's  grant of leave\nto  take  a first  stage  appeal  under  158(a),  necessarily\nincluded consideration  of the issues relevant  to a  1292(b)\ncertificate.  In this  case, the district court's articulated\nreasons for  granting leave under    158(a) included findings\nopposed  to  those  required   for  issuance  of  a   1292(b)\ncertificate,  and so  we  need not  reach  the further  issue\nwhether  appellant's   failure   to  seek   the   certificate\neffectively waived his right to do so.\n\n                             -5-\n",

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), the Court held\n       \n\nthat following appeal from an interlocutory bankruptcy  order\n\nto the  district court under    158(a), further discretionary\n\nreview might then be sought in the court of  appeals under 28\n\nU.S.C.    1292(b).  However,  this avenue, too,  is closed to\n\nappellant, as   1292(b)  grants discretionary jurisdiction to\n\nthe court  of appeals only  if the  district court  certifies\n\nthat the case involves  \"a controlling question of law  as to\n\nwhich  there  is  a  substantial  ground  for  difference  of\n\nopinion,\"   and  an   immediate  resolution  by   appeal  may\n\n\"materially   advance\"  the   ultimate  termination   of  the\n\nlitigation.   Although appellant's failure to  expressly seek\n\nsuch a certificate here might be held to be a waiver, we need\n\nnot  decide that question, for contrary to the allowance in  \n\n1292(b), the  district  court expressly  determined that  the\n\nonly legal issues raised were simple, and easily  disposed of\n\n                             -4-\n\non  the merits.1    Finally, as  it  appears that  there  are\n\navailable  adequate alternative appellate  processes, we have\n\nno occasion consider  these appeals under the  All Writs Act,\n\n28 U.S.C.   1651.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons,  these appeals are  dismissed\n                                                             \n\nwithout prejudice.   Since we  have no jurisdiction,  we also\n                                                             \n\ndeny  appellant's motion  to supplement  the record  with new\n                                                             \n\nevidence.   Appellee's  request  for costs  and sanctions  is\n                                                             \n\ndenied.\n       \n\n                    \n\n1.  Unlike 28  U.S.C.   1292(b),   158(a) does not  set forth\nexpress  standards to  guide  the district  court's grant  of\nleave to appeal from an interlocutory bankruptcy order to the\ndistrict court.   In the absence of an  express certification\nunder   1292(b),  then, we  would  not  ordinarily  be  in  a\nposition to conclude  that a district court's  grant of leave\nto  take  a first  stage  appeal  under  158(a),  necessarily\nincluded consideration  of the issues relevant  to a  1292(b)\ncertificate.  In this  case, the district court's articulated\nreasons for  granting leave under    158(a) included findings\nopposed  to  those  required   for  issuance  of  a   1292(b)\ncertificate,  and so  we  need not  reach  the further  issue\nwhether  appellant's   failure   to  seek   the   certificate\neffectively waived his right to do so.\n\n                             -5-\n</pre>",
