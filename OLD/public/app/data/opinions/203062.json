R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey is substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzáles as respondent.\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Ilir Hoxha applied for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the federal regulations\n\nimplementing      the   Convention     Against    Torture       (\"CAT\").      An\n\nimmigration judge (\"IJ\") found him not credible, denied all of his\n\nclaims, and ordered him removed.             He appealed to the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which affirmed the IJ's opinion.\n\nHohxa now petitions for review of the BIA's denial of his appeal,\n\nclaiming the BIA erred in finding him not credible.             He also raises\n\na new claim that his due process rights were violated in an early\n\nseries of immigration hearings.            After careful consideration, we\n\ndeny the petition.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n             Hoxha is an Albanian national who entered the United\n\nStates in December 1999 on a false passport.                He did not speak\n\nEnglish, and enlisted the help of another Albanian -- Hamdi Dega --\n\nin preparing and filing his asylum application on September 6,\n\n2000.      Dega's brother, Agim Dega, served as Hoxha's translator\n\nduring the initial interview with an asylum officer, who then\n\nprepared and filed an assessment memo on October 17, 2000.                     A\n\nseries of hearings was held before an IJ in New York.                       Upon\n\ndiscovering that the application had been prepared by Hamdi Dega,\n\nwho   is   not   authorized    to   practice   law   and   is   notorious    for\n\ninventing     stories   in    Albanians'    asylum   applications,     the    IJ\n\ndeclared that he would not consider the asylum application.                Hoxha\n\nsubsequently submitted a statement, dated April 17, 2001, in which\n\nhe purported to correct the inaccuracies in the application.                 The\n\n                                      -2-\n\fIJ found this statement insufficient and ordered that an entirely\n\nnew   application    be    prepared.      Hoxha   then    prepared   a   second\n\napplication with the assistance of a lawyer, and submitted it on\n\nJuly 25, 2001.      At a subsequent hearing, the IJ berated Hoxha at\n\nlength for being so foolish as to choose Dega to assist him.                No\n\ntestimony was taken at any of these New York hearings.\n\n            Hoxha requested and was granted a change of venue to\n\nBoston.    The new IJ re-marked all of the documentary evidence, and\n\nHoxha testified in support of his application.             Hoxha stated that\n\nhe became actively involved in the Albanian Democratic Party\n\nfollowing the restoration of democracy in 1990. In a 1992 protest,\n\nHoxha and his father were arrested and held in detention for two\n\ndays; they were warned to cease their involvement in Democratic\n\nParty activities.         Despite this warning, Hoxha continued to be\n\nactive.     He served as an election observer on behalf of the\n\nDemocratic Party in June 1997, and refused to certify the election\n\nbecause of what he claimed was Socialist Party manipulation of the\n\nvotes.    According to Hoxha, Socialist Party members threatened him\n\nand dynamited a part of his house; he soon grew so afraid that he\n\nagreed to certify the vote.        In August 1998, the secret service\n\nsearched Hoxha's house; Hoxha was absent, but they beat his father,\n\nwho died two days later.       Hoxha testified that, in September 1998,\n\nhe attended the funeral of an assassinated Democratic Party leader\n\nand was beaten by police with rubber sticks.              A few days later he\n\nwas   arrested,     questioned   about       Democratic   Party   activities,\n\nthreatened, and beaten again.          Hoxha was arrested and detained yet\n\n                                       -3-\n\fagain in October 1999, and was told he would be killed if he\n\ncontinued his Democratic Party activities.           Shortly thereafter,\n\nHoxha left for the United States.\n\n           On May 26, 2005, the IJ denied Hoxha's request for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because Hoxha had\n\nfailed to provide credible testimony in support of his alleged fear\n\nof   persecution   in   Albania.1    The   IJ   pointed   to   a   number   of\n\ninconsistencies between Hoxha's testimony and other evidence in the\n\nrecord, including the following: (1) documents submitted by Hoxha,\n\nHoxha's testimony, and a written statement by Hoxha's mother\n\nprovided various different dates for when Hoxha became active in\n\nthe Democratic Party; (2) Hoxha testified that he stopped giving\n\nmoney to the Party after he became unemployed in 1997, but in his\n\nJuly 2001 asylum application he stated that he was employed as a\n\nsalesman from 1997 to 1999; (3) the personal statement accompanying\n\nHoxha's July 2001 application asserts that he was hit with a rifle\n\nbutt at the 1998 funeral; an April 2004 affidavit submitted by\n\nHoxha asserts he was hit with a baton; Hoxha testified that he was\n\nhit with rubber sticks; and he makes no mention of this incident at\n\nall in the April 2001 statement; (4) Hoxha testified that he, his\n\nbrother, and his mother were beaten when the police came to arrest\n\nhim at his home in September 1998, but neither the April 2001\n\nstatement nor the April 2004 affidavit mention this beating, and\n\n\n\n1\n   At one of the several hearings in Boston, the IJ stated that he\nwould give no weight to the application prepared with the help of\nHamdi Dega.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fhis mother's statement also makes no mention of it; (5) the asylum\n\nofficer's October 2000 assessment memo, prepared on the basis of\n\nAgim Dega's translation, stated that Hoxha's father was hit with\n\nthe butt of a gun during the September 1998 incident, but also\n\nstates that his father died in August 1998; (6) the October 2000\n\nassessment memo also stated that, in October 1999, Hoxha was\n\narrested and boiled eggs were placed under his armpits, but Hoxha\n\ntestified that no boiled eggs were ever placed under his arms; (7)\n\nHoxha testified at the hearing and asserted in the July 2001\n\nstatement that he was threatened by Socialists the night before the\n\n1997 elections, but the April 2001 statement and the 2004 affidavit\n\nstate that he was threatened on the evening of the elections; (8)\n\nHoxha testified that an explosive device went off at his house in\n\nJuly 1997, but that no one was injured; the October 2000 assessment\n\nmemo   states   that   Hoxha   and   his   father   were   injured   in   the\n\nexplosion; and the April 2001 statement states that Hoxha and both\n\nhis parents were injured; and (9) documents presented by Hoxha show\n\nthat the Albanian police issued him a passport after he had left\n\nAlbania, even though Hoxha claimed this same police force was\n\nseeking to kill him for his political involvement.\n\n           The BIA affirmed the IJ's determination.              While it\n\nfaulted the IJ for considering the October 2000 assessment memo, as\n\nit had been prepared based on a translation provided by Agim Dega,\n\nthe BIA nonetheless concluded that the IJ's adverse credibility\n\ndetermination was not clearly erroneous.            It briefly discussed\n\nthree examples of the discrepancies in the evidence on record and\n\n                                     -5-\n\fconcluded that \"[i]nasmuch as the respondent failed to provide a\n\nconvincing explanation for these discrepancies -- other than to\n\nplace blame on others, including the [Democratic Party of Albania]\n\nSecretary, his attorney's translators, and his mother's memory --\n\nwe   find   no   clear   error   in   the   Immigration   Judge's   adverse\n\ncredibility determination in this case . . . .\"\n\n            Hoxha now petitions for review of the BIA's adverse\n\ncredibility determination.       He also raises a new claim, that the\n\nBIA erred in neglecting to consider due process violations that\n\noccurred at the hearings before the IJ in New York.         Hoxha requests\n\nthat we vacate the adverse credibility finding and remand for\n\nfurther     proceedings    to    consider     his   substantive     asylum,\n\nwithholding, and CAT claims.           After careful consideration, we\n\naffirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f                          II.   Discussion\n\n          A.   Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n          Ordinarily, we review decisions of the BIA only; however,\n\nwhere the BIA has deferred to or adopted and affirmed findings of\n\nthe IJ, we also review the adopted portion of the IJ's decision.\n\nHernández-Barrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2004); see\n\nalso Mewengkang v. Gonzáles, 486 F.3d 737, 739 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(\"Where the BIA has adopted the IJ's credibility determination,\n\n. . . we review the determination of the IJ.\").     An applicant for\n\nasylum must prove he is a refugee within the meaning of the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1), which he\n\nmay do by showing \"past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution\" based on political opinion.     Ali v. Gonzáles,\n\n401 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2005).    The evidence in support of this\n\nshowing must be both \"credible and specific.\" Bojorques-Villanueva\n\nv. INS, 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          An alien may be found incredible based on discrepancies\n\nin testimony where \"(1) the discrepancies and omissions described\n\nby the [IJ or BIA] are actually present; (2) these discrepancies\n\nand omissions provide specific and cogent reasons to conclude that\n\nthe   respondent   provided   incredible   testimony;    and   (3)   the\n\nrespondent has not provided a convincing explanation for the\n\ndiscrepancies and omissions.\"    In re A-S-, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1106,\n\n1109 (BIA 1998); see also Hoxha v. Gonzáles, 446 F.3d 210, 216-17\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (applying test from In re A-S-).        Yet \"an adverse\n\ncredibility determination cannot rest on trivia but must be based\n\n                                 -7-\n\fon discrepancies that involved the heart of the asylum claim.\" See\n\nBojorques-Villanueva,        194   F.3d   at   16   (citation   and    internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n            We     accord    \"significant      respect\"    to   the     adverse\n\ncredibility determination of an IJ or the BIA, provided it is\n\nsupported by specific findings in the record.             Afful v. Ashcroft,\n\n380 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Aguilar-Solís v. INS,                   168\n\nF.3d 565, 571 (1st Cir. 1999)).           We review the reasons given for\n\ndisbelieving an asylum applicant under the \"substantial evidence\"\n\nstandard:        the   credibility   determination     \"must    be    upheld    if\n\nsupported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the\n\nrecord considered as a whole.\"        Mendes v. INS, 197 F.3d 6, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (quoting INS v. Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).               We will uphold an\n\nadverse credibility determination unless the record evidence would\n\ncompel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\n\nStroni v. Gonzáles, 454 F.3d 82, 87 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Aliens facing removal are entitled to due process under\n\nthe Fifth Amendment.        Ishak v. Gonzáles, 422 F.3d 22, 32 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).      We review due process claims asserted in immigration\n\nproceedings de novo.        Zheng v. Gonzáles, 464 F.3d 60, 62 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f             B.   Credibility Determinations\n\n             Hoxha argues that we should ignore the IJ's decision, and\n\nlook only at the reasons given by the BIA, because the BIA did not\n\nadopt the IJ's reasoning; instead, it \"rendered its own decision\n\nbased on its own review of the record and some, but not all, of the\n\n[IJ]'s reasons.\"           We disagree.        As noted above, we read the IJ's\n\nfindings as those of the BIA to the extent that the BIA has\n\ndeferred to or adopted them.                   See Hernández-Barrera, 373 F.3d\n\nat 20.    In this case, although the BIA did not expressly state that\n\nit adopted the IJ's findings concerning the discrepancies between\n\nHoxha's testimony and other documents in the record, it clearly\n\ndeferred    to    them,      with   one    significant      exception:           the   BIA\n\ndetermined that the IJ had erred in relying in part on the October\n\n2000     assessment    memo     prepared        on   the   basis    of    Agim    Dega's\n\ntranslation.      \"Be that as it may,\" the BIA stated, \"we note that\n\nthe Immigration Judge identified a number of other inconsistencies\n\nand omissions . . . .\"          The BIA then proceeded to enumerate three\n\nexamples of the many given by the IJ.                 The Board was not required\n\nto repeat and expressly endorse each of the IJ's reasons seriatim.\n\n             We    thus      turn    to        whether     the     IJ's    credibility\n\ndetermination,        as    deferred      to    by   the   BIA,    is     supported    by\n\nsubstantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.                        Some of\n\nthe inconsistencies cited by the IJ are trivial and, standing\n\nalone, would probably not provide substantial evidence in support\n\nof an adverse credibility determination.                   The obvious example is\n\nthe discrepancy concerning what type of weapon -- rifle butt,\n\n                                           -9-\n\fbaton, or rubber stick -- was used to beat Hoxha at the 1998\n\nfuneral.      Nevertheless, even disregarding the IJ's findings that\n\nhinged upon an inconsistency between the October 2000 assessment\n\nmemo    and     another       document     or      Hoxha's    testimony,2       other\n\ninconsistencies strike closer to the heart of Hoxha's asylum claim,\n\nparticularly those that have to do with whether Hoxha or his family\n\nwere harassed or beaten, and the extent of such harassment or\n\nbeatings. We discuss two examples. First, Hoxha testified that he\n\nand    his   mother    were   beaten     when      the   police   arrested   him    in\n\nSeptember 1998; however, none of the documents in the record\n\nmention this beating including, most tellingly, Hoxha's mother's\n\nstatement. Considering the trauma such an event would have caused,\n\none would expect the mother to have remembered to mention it in her\n\nstatement     supporting      her    son's    asylum      application.       Hoxha's\n\nexplanation that she is simply forgetful is unconvincing.                    Second,\n\nHoxha testified that no one was injured when an explosive device\n\nwas detonated at his home in July 1997; this evidence contradicted\n\nhis assertion in the April 2001 statement that he and his parents\n\nwere injured.         Even ignoring the October 2000 assessment memo's\n\ncorroboration     that     Hoxha     and     his    father    were   injured,      the\n\ndiscrepancy between Hoxha's testimony and the April 2001 statement\n\nis clear and significant.           When confronted with the discrepancy at\n\none of the hearings, Hoxha attempted to explain that what he\n\n\n2\n   We disregard the cited inconsistency as to whether Hoxha's\nfather was still alive to have suffered a beating at the September\n1998 funeral. We also disregard the inconsistency over whether\nboiled eggs were placed under Hoxha's arms.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fintended to say in the April 2001 statement was that he and his\n\nfamily suffered psychological, not physical, injury.            The IJ\n\nobviously disbelieved this explanation or was otherwise unconvinced\n\nthat it cured the discrepancy, and we see no reason to disturb this\n\nfinding.\n\n           Considering   the   cumulative   effect   of   the   various\n\ncognizable discrepancies among the pieces of evidence in the\n\nrecord, we find that a reasonable trier of fact would not be\n\ncompelled to reach a determination different from that of the IJ.\n\nAs such, we conclude that the IJ did not err in concluding that\n\nHoxha was not credible, and the BIA did not err in affirming and\n\nadopting the IJ's adverse credibility finding.\n\n           C.   Due Process Claim\n\n           Hoxha claims that he was denied due process in the New\n\nYork hearings because the IJ \"ranted and raved for hours about\n\n[his] choice of Hamdi Dega,\" \"repeatedly implied that [he] should\n\nnot be believed\" because of \"choices he made with his legal\n\nrepresentation,\" and took judicial notice that Hamdi Dega had been\n\na high-ranking Communist official in Albania.    According to Hoxha,\n\nthe notion that he would choose to associate with Hamdi Dega called\n\ninto question his story that he had been persecuted by Albanian\n\nSocialist Party members, and this tainted his credibility in\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n           This argument is unpersuasive.    An applicant claiming a\n\ndue process violation cannot prevail unless he shows that prejudice\n\nresulted. See, e.g., Kheireddine v. Gonzáles, 427 F.3d 80, 85 (1st\n\n                                 -11-\n\fCir. 2005).   After transfer to Boston, the IJ deliberately re-\n\nmarked all the documentary evidence and conducted a completely new\n\nhearing on the merits, thus providing Hoxha with a clean slate.\n\nThere is no indication in the respective decisions of the BIA or\n\nthe IJ, or anywhere else in the record, that either paid regard to\n\nthe observations or opinions of the IJ in the New York proceedings.\n\nMore fundamentally, Hoxha did not raise this specific claim before\n\nthe BIA, and has thus failed to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\nSee Mendes v. INS, 197 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1999) (failure to\n\nsufficiently raise due process claim at deportation hearings or\n\nbefore BIA precludes judicial review).\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

Ilir Hoxha applied for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the federal regulations\n\nimplementing      the   Convention     Against    Torture       (\"CAT\").      An\n\nimmigration judge (\"IJ\") found him not credible, denied all of his\n\nclaims, and ordered him removed.             He appealed to the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which affirmed the IJ's opinion.\n\nHohxa now petitions for review of the BIA's denial of his appeal,\n\nclaiming the BIA erred in finding him not credible.             He also raises\n\na new claim that his due process rights were violated in an early\n\nseries of immigration hearings.            After careful consideration, we\n\ndeny the petition.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n             Hoxha is an Albanian national who entered the United\n\nStates in December 1999 on a false passport.                He did not speak\n\nEnglish, and enlisted the help of another Albanian -- Hamdi Dega --\n\nin preparing and filing his asylum application on September 6,\n\n2000.      Dega's brother, Agim Dega, served as Hoxha's translator\n\nduring the initial interview with an asylum officer, who then\n\nprepared and filed an assessment memo on October 17, 2000.                     A\n\nseries of hearings was held before an IJ in New York.                       Upon\n\ndiscovering that the application had been prepared by Hamdi Dega,\n\nwho   is   not   authorized    to   practice   law   and   is   notorious    for\n\ninventing     stories   in    Albanians'    asylum   applications,     the    IJ\n\ndeclared that he would not consider the asylum application.                Hoxha\n\nsubsequently submitted a statement, dated April 17, 2001, in which\n\nhe purported to correct the inaccuracies in the application.                 The\n\n                                      -2-\n\fIJ found this statement insufficient and ordered that an entirely\n\nnew   application    be    prepared.      Hoxha   then    prepared   a   second\n\napplication with the assistance of a lawyer, and submitted it on\n\nJuly 25, 2001.      At a subsequent hearing, the IJ berated Hoxha at\n\nlength for being so foolish as to choose Dega to assist him.                No\n\ntestimony was taken at any of these New York hearings.\n\n            Hoxha requested and was granted a change of venue to\n\nBoston.    The new IJ re-marked all of the documentary evidence, and\n\nHoxha testified in support of his application.             Hoxha stated that\n\nhe became actively involved in the Albanian Democratic Party\n\nfollowing the restoration of democracy in 1990. In a 1992 protest,\n\nHoxha and his father were arrested and held in detention for two\n\ndays; they were warned to cease their involvement in Democratic\n\nParty activities.         Despite this warning, Hoxha continued to be\n\nactive.     He served as an election observer on behalf of the\n\nDemocratic Party in June 1997, and refused to certify the election\n\nbecause of what he claimed was Socialist Party manipulation of the\n\nvotes.    According to Hoxha, Socialist Party members threatened him\n\nand dynamited a part of his house; he soon grew so afraid that he\n\nagreed to certify the vote.        In August 1998, the secret service\n\nsearched Hoxha's house; Hoxha was absent, but they beat his father,\n\nwho died two days later.       Hoxha testified that, in September 1998,\n\nhe attended the funeral of an assassinated Democratic Party leader\n\nand was beaten by police with rubber sticks.              A few days later he\n\nwas   arrested,     questioned   about       Democratic   Party   activities,\n\nthreatened, and beaten again.          Hoxha was arrested and detained yet\n\n                                       -3-\n\fagain in October 1999, and was told he would be killed if he\n\ncontinued his Democratic Party activities.           Shortly thereafter,\n\nHoxha left for the United States.\n\n           On May 26, 2005, the IJ denied Hoxha's request for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because Hoxha had\n\nfailed to provide credible testimony in support of his alleged fear\n\nof   persecution   in   Albania.1    The   IJ   pointed   to   a   number   of\n\ninconsistencies between Hoxha's testimony and other evidence in the\n\nrecord, including the following: (1) documents submitted by Hoxha,\n\nHoxha's testimony, and a written statement by Hoxha's mother\n\nprovided various different dates for when Hoxha became active in\n\nthe Democratic Party; (2) Hoxha testified that he stopped giving\n\nmoney to the Party after he became unemployed in 1997, but in his\n\nJuly 2001 asylum application he stated that he was employed as a\n\nsalesman from 1997 to 1999; (3) the personal statement accompanying\n\nHoxha's July 2001 application asserts that he was hit with a rifle\n\nbutt at the 1998 funeral; an April 2004 affidavit submitted by\n\nHoxha asserts he was hit with a baton; Hoxha testified that he was\n\nhit with rubber sticks; and he makes no mention of this incident at\n\nall in the April 2001 statement; (4) Hoxha testified that he, his\n\nbrother, and his mother were beaten when the police came to arrest\n\nhim at his home in September 1998, but neither the April 2001\n\nstatement nor the April 2004 affidavit mention this beating, and\n\n\n\n1\n   At one of the several hearings in Boston, the IJ stated that he\nwould give no weight to the application prepared with the help of\nHamdi Dega.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fhis mother's statement also makes no mention of it; (5) the asylum\n\nofficer's October 2000 assessment memo, prepared on the basis of\n\nAgim Dega's translation, stated that Hoxha's father was hit with\n\nthe butt of a gun during the September 1998 incident, but also\n\nstates that his father died in August 1998; (6) the October 2000\n\nassessment memo also stated that, in October 1999, Hoxha was\n\narrested and boiled eggs were placed under his armpits, but Hoxha\n\ntestified that no boiled eggs were ever placed under his arms; (7)\n\nHoxha testified at the hearing and asserted in the July 2001\n\nstatement that he was threatened by Socialists the night before the\n\n1997 elections, but the April 2001 statement and the 2004 affidavit\n\nstate that he was threatened on the evening of the elections; (8)\n\nHoxha testified that an explosive device went off at his house in\n\nJuly 1997, but that no one was injured; the October 2000 assessment\n\nmemo   states   that   Hoxha   and   his   father   were   injured   in   the\n\nexplosion; and the April 2001 statement states that Hoxha and both\n\nhis parents were injured; and (9) documents presented by Hoxha show\n\nthat the Albanian police issued him a passport after he had left\n\nAlbania, even though Hoxha claimed this same police force was\n\nseeking to kill him for his political involvement.\n\n           The BIA affirmed the IJ's determination.              While it\n\nfaulted the IJ for considering the October 2000 assessment memo, as\n\nit had been prepared based on a translation provided by Agim Dega,\n\nthe BIA nonetheless concluded that the IJ's adverse credibility\n\ndetermination was not clearly erroneous.            It briefly discussed\n\nthree examples of the discrepancies in the evidence on record and\n\n                                     -5-\n\fconcluded that \"[i]nasmuch as the respondent failed to provide a\n\nconvincing explanation for these discrepancies -- other than to\n\nplace blame on others, including the [Democratic Party of Albania]\n\nSecretary, his attorney's translators, and his mother's memory --\n\nwe   find   no   clear   error   in   the   Immigration   Judge's   adverse\n\ncredibility determination in this case . . . .\"\n\n            Hoxha now petitions for review of the BIA's adverse\n\ncredibility determination.       He also raises a new claim, that the\n\nBIA erred in neglecting to consider due process violations that\n\noccurred at the hearings before the IJ in New York.         Hoxha requests\n\nthat we vacate the adverse credibility finding and remand for\n\nfurther     proceedings    to    consider     his   substantive     asylum,\n\nwithholding, and CAT claims.           After careful consideration, we\n\naffirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f                          II.   Discussion\n\n          A.

Credibility Determinations\n\n             Hoxha argues that we should ignore the IJ's decision, and\n\nlook only at the reasons given by the BIA, because the BIA did not\n\nadopt the IJ's reasoning; instead, it \"rendered its own decision\n\nbased on its own review of the record and some, but not all, of the\n\n[IJ]'s reasons.\"           We disagree.        As noted above, we read the IJ's\n\nfindings as those of the BIA to the extent that the BIA has\n\ndeferred to or adopted them.                   See Hernández-Barrera, 373 F.3d\n\nat 20.    In this case, although the BIA did not expressly state that\n\nit adopted the IJ's findings concerning the discrepancies between\n\nHoxha's testimony and other documents in the record, it clearly\n\ndeferred    to    them,      with   one    significant      exception:           the   BIA\n\ndetermined that the IJ had erred in relying in part on the October\n\n2000     assessment    memo     prepared        on   the   basis    of    Agim    Dega's\n\ntranslation.      \"Be that as it may,\" the BIA stated, \"we note that\n\nthe Immigration Judge identified a number of other inconsistencies\n\nand omissions . . . .\"          The BIA then proceeded to enumerate three\n\nexamples of the many given by the IJ.                 The Board was not required\n\nto repeat and expressly endorse each of the IJ's reasons seriatim.\n\n             We    thus      turn    to        whether     the     IJ's    credibility\n\ndetermination,        as    deferred      to    by   the   BIA,    is     supported    by\n\nsubstantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.                        Some of\n\nthe inconsistencies cited by the IJ are trivial and, standing\n\nalone, would probably not provide substantial evidence in support\n\nof an adverse credibility determination.                   The obvious example is\n\nthe discrepancy concerning what type of weapon -- rifle butt,\n\n                                           -9-\n\fbaton, or rubber stick -- was used to beat Hoxha at the 1998\n\nfuneral.      Nevertheless, even disregarding the IJ's findings that\n\nhinged upon an inconsistency between the October 2000 assessment\n\nmemo    and     another       document     or      Hoxha's    testimony,2       other\n\ninconsistencies strike closer to the heart of Hoxha's asylum claim,\n\nparticularly those that have to do with whether Hoxha or his family\n\nwere harassed or beaten, and the extent of such harassment or\n\nbeatings. We discuss two examples. First, Hoxha testified that he\n\nand    his   mother    were   beaten     when      the   police   arrested   him    in\n\nSeptember 1998; however, none of the documents in the record\n\nmention this beating including, most tellingly, Hoxha's mother's\n\nstatement. Considering the trauma such an event would have caused,\n\none would expect the mother to have remembered to mention it in her\n\nstatement     supporting      her    son's    asylum      application.       Hoxha's\n\nexplanation that she is simply forgetful is unconvincing.                    Second,\n\nHoxha testified that no one was injured when an explosive device\n\nwas detonated at his home in July 1997; this evidence contradicted\n\nhis assertion in the April 2001 statement that he and his parents\n\nwere injured.         Even ignoring the October 2000 assessment memo's\n\ncorroboration     that     Hoxha     and     his    father    were   injured,      the\n\ndiscrepancy between Hoxha's testimony and the April 2001 statement\n\nis clear and significant.           When confronted with the discrepancy at\n\none of the hearings, Hoxha attempted to explain that what he\n\n\n2\n   We disregard the cited inconsistency as to whether Hoxha's\nfather was still alive to have suffered a beating at the September\n1998 funeral. We also disregard the inconsistency over whether\nboiled eggs were placed under Hoxha's arms.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fintended to say in the April 2001 statement was that he and his\n\nfamily suffered psychological, not physical, injury.            The IJ\n\nobviously disbelieved this explanation or was otherwise unconvinced\n\nthat it cured the discrepancy, and we see no reason to disturb this\n\nfinding.\n\n           Considering   the   cumulative   effect   of   the   various\n\ncognizable discrepancies among the pieces of evidence in the\n\nrecord, we find that a reasonable trier of fact would not be\n\ncompelled to reach a determination different from that of the IJ.\n\nAs such, we conclude that the IJ did not err in concluding that\n\nHoxha was not credible, and the BIA did not err in affirming and\n\nadopting the IJ's adverse credibility finding.\n\n           C.   Due Process Claim\n\n           Hoxha claims that he was denied due process in the New\n\nYork hearings because the IJ \"ranted and raved for hours about\n\n[his] choice of Hamdi Dega,\" \"repeatedly implied that [he] should\n\nnot be believed\" because of \"choices he made with his legal\n\nrepresentation,\" and took judicial notice that Hamdi Dega had been\n\na high-ranking Communist official in Albania.    According to Hoxha,\n\nthe notion that he would choose to associate with Hamdi Dega called\n\ninto question his story that he had been persecuted by Albanian\n\nSocialist Party members, and this tainted his credibility in\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n           This argument is unpersuasive.    An applicant claiming a\n\ndue process violation cannot prevail unless he shows that prejudice\n\nresulted. See, e.g., Kheireddine v.

After transfer to Boston, the IJ deliberately re-\n\nmarked all the documentary evidence and conducted a completely new\n\nhearing on the merits, thus providing Hoxha with a clean slate.\n\nThere is no indication in the respective decisions of the BIA or\n\nthe IJ, or anywhere else in the record, that either paid regard to\n\nthe observations or opinions of the IJ in the New York proceedings.\n\nMore fundamentally, Hoxha did not raise this specific claim before\n\nthe BIA, and has thus failed to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\nSee Mendes v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198722\"><a href=\"/opinion/198722/mendes-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1st Cir. 1999) (failure to\n\nsufficiently raise due process claim at deportation hearings or\n\nbefore BIA precludes judicial review).\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f</pre>",
