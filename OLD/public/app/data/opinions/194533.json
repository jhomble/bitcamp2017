Plaintiffs-\n                                            \n\nappellants  raise two  issues  on appeal:    (1) whether  the\n\ndistrict   court  properly   granted  summary   judgment  for\n\ndefendant-appellee because  of lack of evidence of causation;\n\nand  (2) whether the district court  abused its discretion in\n\ndenying plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the summary\n\njudgment.  We affirm the district court on both issues.\n\n                              I.\n\n                THE DISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS\n                                              \n\n          On November 14,  1990, the  plaintiffs, father  and\n\nmother of Carlos Serrano de Diego, filed  a complaint against\n\ndefendant-appellee, ICI  Americas, Inc., (\"ICI\")  and others.\n\nThere  has been no  appeal as to  the other  defendants.  The\n\ncomplaint states that  it is \"based on negligence  in failure\n\nto adequately  warn and strict  liability.\"  It  alleges that\n\nplaintiffs'  son, Carlos, was a farm worker for ten years and\n\nas such  was required  to come  into contact  with \"chemicals\n\nand/or agricultural products\" manufactured by the defendants.\n\nThe complaint  states that the  chemicals and/or agricultural\n\nproducts  with  which Carlos  Serrano  came  in contact  \"are\n\nunknown  at  this time.\"   The  complaint  alleges that  as a\n\nresult  of   coming  in   contact  with  the   chemicals  and\n\nagricultural  products  manufactured  by  defendants,  Carlos\n\nSerrano developed \"an aplastic  anemia that culminated in his\n\n                             -2-\n\ndeath\"  on January 4, 1990.  Damages of three million dollars\n\nwere sought.\n\n          In its  answer, ICI admitted  that it  manufactures\n\nand   sells  agricultural  chemical  products  and  conducted\n\nbusiness in Puerto  Rico.  It specified  that it manufactured\n\nand sold agricultural products under the trade name Gramaxone\n\nfrom 1985 to 1987.  \n\n          On August 2, 1991,  the district court ordered that\n\ndiscovery  be concluded by December 31, 1991.  A deadline was\n\nset for the disclosure of expert witnesses.  On September 26,\n\n1991,  all  parties  brought  a joint  motion  requesting  an\n\nextension of  the discovery cut-off  date to March  31, 1992.\n\nThe  court  responded  in  October  of  1991  by  granting  a\n\ndiscovery extension to February  5, 1992.  Trial was  set for\n\nMay 11, 1992.\n\n          On  April 28, 1992,  the court  granted defendants'\n\nmotions for summary judgment.   On May 13 plaintiffs  filed a\n\nmotion for  reconsideration of  the summary judgment;  it was\n\ndenied on August 4, 1992.\n\n                             II.\n\n                       SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n                                       \n\n          We  review a summary judgment de novo.  We read the\n                                               \n\nrecord and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in\n\nthe light  most  favorable to  the  non-moving party.    E.H.\n                                                             \n\nAshley  &amp; Co. v. Wells  Fargo Alarm Services,  907 F.2d 1274,\n                                            \n\n                             -3-\n\n1277 (1st Cir. 1990).   Summary judgment is mandated  \"if the\n\npleadings,  depositions,  answers  to   interrogatories,  and\n\nadmissions  on file,  together with  the affidavits,  if any,\n\nshow that  there is no genuine issue  as to any material fact\n\nand  that the  moving party  is entitled  to a judgment  as a\n\nmatter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56(c).  \"[S]ummary judgment\n\nwill  not lie  if  the  dispute  about  a  material  fact  is\n\n'genuine,' that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable\n\njury  could  return  a  verdict  for  the  nonmoving  party.\"\n\nAnderson v. Liberty  Lobby, Inc., 477  U.S. 242, 248  (1986).\n                                \n\nUnder Rule 56(e):\n\n          . . .  When a motion for summary judgment\n          is made and supported as provided in this\n          rule, an adverse party  may not rest upon\n          the  mere allegations  or denials  of the\n          adverse party's pleading, but the adverse\n          party's  response,  by  affidavits or  as\n          otherwise provided in this rule, must set\n          forth specific facts  showing that  there\n          is  a genuine  issue for  trial.   If the\n          adverse  party  does   not  so   respond,\n          summary  judgment, if  appropriate, shall\n          be entered against the adverse party.\n\n\"The  mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of\n\nthe plaintiff's position will  be insufficient; there must be\n\nevidence  on which  the jury  could reasonably  find  for the\n\nplaintiff.\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.\n                     \n\n          . . .  In our view, the plain language of\n          Rule 56(e) mandates the entry  of summary\n          judgment,   after   adequate   time   for\n          discovery  and  upon  motion,  against  a\n          party   who  fails  to   make  a  showing\n          sufficient to establish the  existence of\n          an  element  essential  to  that  party's\n\n                             -4-\n\n          case, and on  which that party will  bear\n          the burden of proof at trial.\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).\n                        \n\n          In  its opinion and order granting summary judgment\n\nfor the defendants the  court noted that defendants presented\n\nthe  testimony of  six  expert witnesses  to the  effect that\n\nthere  was no  causal connection  between any  of defendants'\n\npesticides and aplastic  anemia.   Defendants also  submitted\n\nmedical  literature to  the court  showing that there  was no\n\ncausal   link   between  aplastic   anemia   and  defendants'\n\npesticides.   The court further found that plaintiffs had not\n\npresented  any expert  testimony indicating  that defendants'\n\npesticides caused aplastic anemia.\n\n          We  have scoured  the record  thoroughly, including\n\nstatements  in  Carlos Serrano's  hospital records  that were\n\nexcluded  by the district court,  and have found nothing that\n\nwould  engender a genuine issue of material fact.1  There was\n\nno  expert  testimony   or  medical  literature   offered  by\n\nplaintiffs  tending   to  establish  a  causal  link  between\n\ndefendants'  pesticides and aplastic anemia.  It is true that\n\nthe  excluded  hospital  records  indicated  a  link  between\n\npesticides and Carlos  Serrano's illness.   But there was  no\n\nevidence  that  any of  the  pesticides  manufactured by  the\n\n                    \n\n1  We  do  not intimate  that  the  district  court erred  in\nexcluding  the portions  of the  hospital records  offered in\nevidence.\n\n                             -5-\n\ndefendants could have  caused aplastic anemia.   More to  the\n\npoint,  there   was   no  evidence   offered  by   plaintiffs\n\nimplicating  Gramaxone, which  was  manufactured by  the sole\n\nremaining  defendant -  ICI Americas, Inc.  - as  a causative\n\nagent of aplastic  anemia.  The district  court concluded its\n\nsummary judgment order as follows:\n\n               Plaintiffs in this case have offered\n          no evidence, no  expert testimony, and no\n          epidemiological  data  that  would  prove\n          that   defendants'   insecticides  caused\n          Serrano's aplastic anemia.  Nor have they\n          submitted   evidence   that   defendants'\n          insecticides can cause aplastic anemia at\n          all.  Plaintiffs have failed to set forth\n          any  specific facts  that show  a genuine\n          triable  issue as  to  the  causation  of\n          Serrano's illness.\n\n          After reviewing  the record carefully in  the light\n\nmost  favorable to plaintiffs-appellants,  we are constrained\n\nto agree.  The summary judgment is affirmed.\n\n                             III.\n\n             DENIAL OF MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION\n                                                 \n\n          In denying plaintiffs'  motion for  reconsideration\n\nof the summary judgment, the district court stated:\n\n               On April 28, 1992, the Court granted\n          defendants' motions  for summary judgment\n          on the grounds that plaintiffs had failed\n          to  present   evidence  that  defendants'\n          insecticides   caused    the   decedent's\n          aplastic  anemia.    Plaintiffs  now move\n          for reconsideration on  the grounds  that\n          they  have obtained  the  services of  an\n          expert who has stated that there may be a\n          link  between  defendants'  products  and\n          aplastic anemia.\n\n                             -6-\n\n               This  case  was  filed  in  November\n          1990.    In  October of  1991,  the Court\n          granted  the  parties  until February  5,\n          1992   to   conclude   discovery.     The\n          defendants  point   out,  and  plaintiffs\n          admit as much in  their motion, that they\n          were  not  noticed of  this  expert until\n          April  24,  1992,  more than  two  months\n          after the discovery deadline.   Discovery\n          deadlines  are  necessary for  the proper\n          management  of cases.   See  Thibeault v.\n                                                   \n          Square D Co., 960  F.2d 239, 247 n.7 (1st\n                      \n          Cir. 1992).   Because plaintiffs'  expert\n          was secured after the discovery deadline,\n          the Court denies the motion to reconsider\n                    denies\n          based on their expert's testimony.\n\nOn appeal,  plaintiffs claim  that the district  court abused\n\nits discretion in denying their motion.  We disagree.  \n\n          The  district  courts   are  necessarily   afforded\n\nsubstantial   discretion   in    ruling   on   motions    for\n\nreconsideration.   See  Mackin v.  City of  Boston, 969  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1273, 1279  (1st Cir. 1992),  cert. denied, 61  U.S.L.W. 3314\n                                          \n\n(1993); Weinberger v. Great  Northern Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n518, 528 (1st  Cir. 1991); see also  Appeal of Sun Pipe  Line\n                                                             \n\nCo., 831 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486  U.S.\n                                                  \n\n1055 (1988).   Substantial discretion, though,  does not mean\n\nunbridled discretion and a  district court's decision to deny\n\na  motion to  reconsider its  judgment will  be reviewed  for\n\nabuse  of discretion.  United States v. Roberts, 978 F.2d 17,\n                                               \n\n20-21,  (1st Cir.  1992); Weinberger,  925 F.2d  at 528;  Sun\n                                                             \n\nPipe, 831  F.2d at  25.   In  Roberts  we reiterated  how  we\n                                     \n\ndetermine whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\n\n                             -7-\n\n               In making discretionary judgments, a\n          district court abuses its discretion when\n          a    relevant    factor   deserving    of\n          significant weight is overlooked, or when\n          an    improper    factor   is    accorded\n          significant  weight,  or  when the  court\n          considers the appropriate mix of factors,\n          but commits a  palpable error of judgment\n          in  calibrating  the  decisional  scales.\n          See  Independent Oil and Chem.

Their use, including the setting\n\nof  specific   deadlines,  is  not  only   within  the  sound\n\ndiscretion of the district court, but has been strongly urged\n\n                             -8-\n\nby us.  In Thibeault v. Square  D Co., 960 F.2d 239, 247  n.7\n                                     \n\n(1st Cir. 1992), we stated: \n\n          .  .  .    [W]e urge,  in  the  strongest\n          possible terms, that district courts (as,\n          indeed, is most  frequently done in  this\n          circuit)   set  pretrial   deadlines  for\n          disclosing the identities of experts.  In\n          the  same vein,  we heartily  endorse the\n          utilization  of discovery  closure dates,\n          available under Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(3), as\n          a case  management tool.  After  all, the\n          adversarial   cast   of  our   system  of\n          justice,  combined with  the increasingly\n          complex  and  unwieldy  nature of  modern\n          litigation  practice, frequently  require\n          that trial courts provide strong guidance\n          to counsel and assume hands-on control of\n          the discovery process.\n\n          Plaintiffs  have advanced three related reasons for\n\ntheir  failure to comply  with the discovery  deadline.  They\n\nargue first  that defendant  made it  difficult  for them  to\n\ndetermine     the     chemical     ingredients     in     its\n\npesticide Gramaxone.      This  difficulty   was  compounded,\n\nplaintiffs claim,  by the  court's pretrial  protective order\n\nthat  precluded the use of  an expert by  plaintiffs that was\n\nassociated with  the manufacturing  of pesticides.2   Both of\n\nthese factors,  according  to plaintiffs,  combined  to  make\n\nobtaining an expert a difficult and slow process.  Plaintiffs\n\nassert  that  the court  was informed  of  this problem  at a\n\n                    \n\n2 The  protective  order  was  issued to  protect  the  trade\nsecrets  pertaining   to  some  of   the  other   defendants'\npesticides, but did not pertain to ICI.\n\n                             -9-\n\npretrial  conference on  February 20, 1992.   This  was after\n\ndiscovery had closed.\n\n          Plaintiffs eventually  obtained the services  of an\n\nexpert,   Dr.  Padovani,   a  university  professor   at  the\n\nUniversity  of Puerto Rico, Magaguez Campus.  It is not clear\n\nfrom plaintiffs'  motion for reconsideration when  the expert\n\nwas retained, but it can be fairly inferred that it was after\n\nthe discovery closure date of February 5, 1992.  According to\n\nplaintiffs' motion for reconsideration:\n\n               As a result  of extensive  research,\n          Dr. Padovani was also of the opinion that\n          Paraquat exposure had led to the onset of\n          aplastic  anemia.   In  support  of  that\n          opinion,    plaintiffs    submitted    to\n          defendant    ICI    fruits    of    their\n          investigation which  established a causal\n          link   and    consisted   of   scientific\n          publications       entitled      Paraquat\n                                                   \n          Intoxication   and   Isolated    Aplastic\n                                                   \n          Anemia,  and   Isolated  Aplastic  Anemia\n                                                   \n          After Paraquat Poisoning.3\n                                  \n\n          This information  was disclosed to  defense counsel\n\non April 24,  1992, more  than two months  after the  cut-off\n\ndate for pretrial discovery.\n\n          Plaintiffs'  reasons   for  failure  to   meet  the\n\ndiscovery  schedule fell  far short  of showing  an  abuse of\n\ndiscretion by the district court.  The deadlines imposed gave\n\nplaintiffs  more than a year from the filing of the complaint\n\nto obtain the  services of  an expert witness.   Counsel  for\n\n                    \n\n3  Paraquat  is one  of  the  ingredients  in Gramaxone,  the\npesticide manufactured by defendant, ICI Americas, Inc.\n\n                             -10-\n\nplaintiffs  knew  or  should  have  known  at  the  time  the\n\ncomplaint   was  drawn  that   only  expert  testimony  could\n\nestablish  a causal  link  between defendant's  pesticide and\n\nCarlos   Serrano's  illness  and  death.    Some  preliminary\n\nspadework  should have  been  done before  the complaint  was\n\nfiled.     We  do  not  think   the  discovery  schedule  was\n\nunreasonably short.\n\n          In a pretrial order issued February 20, 1992, which\n\nplaintiffs  signed,  the  court  listed  as  an  \"uncontested\n\nmaterial  fact\" that  the  plaintiffs had  not proffered  any\n\ncompetent  expert   testimony  showing   that   any  of   the\n\ndefendants' products, to which  exposure was alleged,  caused\n\nthe  aplastic anemia.  By  this time, trial  had already been\n\nset  for March 11, 1992.   Defendants and  the district court\n\nwere noticed of plaintiffs'  proposed expert witness on April\n\n24,  1992 two months  after the  discovery deadline  and less\n\nthan one month prior to the start of the trial.\n\n          Were we  to find that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion  in  denying  the motion  for  reconsideration, we\n\nwould  be   flouting  our   own  precedent,   abdicating  our\n\nsupervisory responsibility,  and turning over the  control of\n\ndiscovery  to the lawyers.

We affirm the district court on both issues.\n\n                              I.\n\n                THE DISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS\n                                              \n\n          On November 14,  1990, the  plaintiffs, father  and\n\nmother of Carlos Serrano de Diego, filed  a complaint against\n\ndefendant-appellee, ICI  Americas, Inc., (\"ICI\")  and others.\n\nThere  has been no  appeal as to  the other  defendants.  The\n\ncomplaint states that  it is \"based on negligence  in failure\n\nto adequately  warn and strict  liability.\"  It  alleges that\n\nplaintiffs'  son, Carlos, was a farm worker for ten years and\n\nas such  was required  to come  into contact  with \"chemicals\n\nand/or agricultural products\" manufactured by the defendants.\n\nThe complaint  states that the  chemicals and/or agricultural\n\nproducts  with  which Carlos  Serrano  came  in contact  \"are\n\nunknown  at  this time.\"   The  complaint  alleges that  as a\n\nresult  of   coming  in   contact  with  the   chemicals  and\n\nagricultural  products  manufactured  by  defendants,  Carlos\n\nSerrano developed \"an aplastic  anemia that culminated in his\n\n                             -2-\n\ndeath\"  on January 4, 1990.  Damages of three million dollars\n\nwere sought.\n\n          In its  answer, ICI admitted  that it  manufactures\n\nand   sells  agricultural  chemical  products  and  conducted\n\nbusiness in Puerto  Rico.  It specified  that it manufactured\n\nand sold agricultural products under the trade name Gramaxone\n\nfrom 1985 to 1987.  \n\n          On August 2, 1991,  the district court ordered that\n\ndiscovery  be concluded by December 31, 1991.  A deadline was\n\nset for the disclosure of expert witnesses.  On September 26,\n\n1991,  all  parties  brought  a joint  motion  requesting  an\n\nextension of  the discovery cut-off  date to March  31, 1992.\n\nThe  court  responded  in  October  of  1991  by  granting  a\n\ndiscovery extension to February  5, 1992.  Trial was  set for\n\nMay 11, 1992.\n\n          On  April 28, 1992,  the court  granted defendants'\n\nmotions for summary judgment.   On May 13 plaintiffs  filed a\n\nmotion for  reconsideration of  the summary judgment;  it was\n\ndenied on August 4, 1992.\n\n                             II.\n\n                       SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n                                       \n\n          We  review a summary judgment de novo.

Defendants also  submitted\n\nmedical  literature to  the court  showing that there  was no\n\ncausal   link   between  aplastic   anemia   and  defendants'\n\npesticides.   The court further found that plaintiffs had not\n\npresented  any expert  testimony indicating  that defendants'\n\npesticides caused aplastic anemia.\n\n          We  have scoured  the record  thoroughly, including\n\nstatements  in  Carlos Serrano's  hospital records  that were\n\nexcluded  by the district court,  and have found nothing that\n\nwould  engender a genuine issue of material fact.1  There was\n\nno  expert  testimony   or  medical  literature   offered  by\n\nplaintiffs  tending   to  establish  a  causal  link  between\n\ndefendants'  pesticides and aplastic anemia.  It is true that\n\nthe  excluded  hospital  records  indicated  a  link  between\n\npesticides and Carlos  Serrano's illness.   But there was  no\n\nevidence  that  any of  the  pesticides  manufactured by  the\n\n                    \n\n1  We  do  not intimate  that  the  district  court erred  in\nexcluding  the portions  of the  hospital records  offered in\nevidence.\n\n                             -5-\n\ndefendants could have  caused aplastic anemia.   More to  the\n\npoint,  there   was   no  evidence   offered  by   plaintiffs\n\nimplicating  Gramaxone, which  was  manufactured by  the sole\n\nremaining  defendant -  ICI Americas, Inc.  - as  a causative\n\nagent of aplastic  anemia.  The district  court concluded its\n\nsummary judgment order as follows:\n\n               Plaintiffs in this case have offered\n          no evidence, no  expert testimony, and no\n          epidemiological  data  that  would  prove\n          that   defendants'   insecticides  caused\n          Serrano's aplastic anemia.  Nor have they\n          submitted   evidence   that   defendants'\n          insecticides can cause aplastic anemia at\n          all.  Plaintiffs have failed to set forth\n          any  specific facts  that show  a genuine\n          triable  issue as  to  the  causation  of\n          Serrano's illness.\n\n          After reviewing  the record carefully in  the light\n\nmost  favorable to plaintiffs-appellants,  we are constrained\n\nto agree.  The summary judgment is affirmed.\n\n                             III.\n\n             DENIAL OF MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION\n                                                 \n\n          In denying plaintiffs'  motion for  reconsideration\n\nof the summary judgment, the district court stated:\n\n               On April 28, 1992, the Court granted\n          defendants' motions  for summary judgment\n          on the grounds that plaintiffs had failed\n          to  present   evidence  that  defendants'\n          insecticides   caused    the   decedent's\n          aplastic  anemia.    Plaintiffs  now move\n          for reconsideration on  the grounds  that\n          they  have obtained  the  services of  an\n          expert who has stated that there may be a\n          link  between  defendants'  products  and\n          aplastic anemia.\n\n                             -6-\n\n               This  case  was  filed  in  November\n          1990.    In  October of  1991,  the Court\n          granted  the  parties  until February  5,\n          1992   to   conclude   discovery.     The\n          defendants  point   out,  and  plaintiffs\n          admit as much in  their motion, that they\n          were  not  noticed of  this  expert until\n          April  24,  1992,  more than  two  months\n          after the discovery deadline.   Discovery\n          deadlines  are  necessary for  the proper\n          management  of cases.   See  Thibeault v.\n                                                   \n          Square D Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580699\"><a href=\"/opinion/580699/charles-m-thibeault-v-square-d-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247 n.7 (1st\n                      \n          Cir. 1992).

In Thibeault v. Square  D Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580699\"><a href=\"/opinion/580699/charles-m-thibeault-v-square-d-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247  n.7\n                                     \n\n(1st Cir. 1992), we stated: \n\n          .  .  .    [W]e urge,  in  the  strongest\n          possible terms, that district courts (as,\n          indeed, is most  frequently done in  this\n          circuit)   set  pretrial   deadlines  for\n          disclosing the identities of experts.  In\n          the  same vein,  we heartily  endorse the\n          utilization  of discovery  closure dates,\n          available under Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(3), as\n          a case  management tool.  After  all, the\n          adversarial   cast   of  our   system  of\n          justice,  combined with  the increasingly\n          complex  and  unwieldy  nature of  modern\n          litigation  practice, frequently  require\n          that trial courts provide strong guidance\n          to counsel and assume hands-on control of\n          the discovery process.\n\n          Plaintiffs  have advanced three related reasons for\n\ntheir  failure to comply  with the discovery  deadline.  They\n\nargue first  that defendant  made it  difficult  for them  to\n\ndetermine     the     chemical     ingredients     in     its\n\npesticide Gramaxone.      This  difficulty   was  compounded,\n\nplaintiffs claim,  by the  court's pretrial  protective order\n\nthat  precluded the use of  an expert by  plaintiffs that was\n\nassociated with  the manufacturing  of pesticides.2   Both of\n\nthese factors,  according  to plaintiffs,  combined  to  make\n\nobtaining an expert a difficult and slow process.  Plaintiffs\n\nassert  that  the court  was informed  of  this problem  at a\n\n                    \n\n2 The  protective  order  was  issued to  protect  the  trade\nsecrets  pertaining   to  some  of   the  other   defendants'\npesticides, but did not pertain to ICI.\n\n                             -9-\n\npretrial  conference on  February 20, 1992.   This  was after\n\ndiscovery had closed.\n\n          Plaintiffs eventually  obtained the services  of an\n\nexpert,   Dr.  Padovani,   a  university  professor   at  the\n\nUniversity  of Puerto Rico, Magaguez Campus.  It is not clear\n\nfrom plaintiffs'  motion for reconsideration when  the expert\n\nwas retained, but it can be fairly inferred that it was after\n\nthe discovery closure date of February 5, 1992.  According to\n\nplaintiffs' motion for reconsideration:\n\n               As a result  of extensive  research,\n          Dr. Padovani was also of the opinion that\n          Paraquat exposure had led to the onset of\n          aplastic  anemia.   In  support  of  that\n          opinion,    plaintiffs    submitted    to\n          defendant    ICI    fruits    of    their\n          investigation which  established a causal\n          link   and    consisted   of   scientific\n          publications       entitled      Paraquat\n                                                   \n          Intoxication   and   Isolated    Aplastic\n                                                   \n          Anemia,  and   Isolated  Aplastic  Anemia\n                                                   \n          After Paraquat Poisoning.3\n                                  \n\n          This information  was disclosed to  defense counsel\n\non April 24,  1992, more  than two months  after the  cut-off\n\ndate for pretrial discovery.\n\n          Plaintiffs'  reasons   for  failure  to   meet  the\n\ndiscovery  schedule fell  far short  of showing  an  abuse of\n\ndiscretion by the district court.  The deadlines imposed gave\n\nplaintiffs  more than a year from the filing of the complaint\n\nto obtain the  services of  an expert witness.   Counsel  for\n\n                    \n\n3  Paraquat  is one  of  the  ingredients  in Gramaxone,  the\npesticide manufactured by defendant, ICI Americas, Inc.\n\n                             -10-\n\nplaintiffs  knew  or  should  have  known  at  the  time  the\n\ncomplaint   was  drawn  that   only  expert  testimony  could\n\nestablish  a causal  link  between defendant's  pesticide and\n\nCarlos   Serrano's  illness  and  death.    Some  preliminary\n\nspadework  should have  been  done before  the complaint  was\n\nfiled.     We  do  not  think   the  discovery  schedule  was\n\nunreasonably short.\n\n          In a pretrial order issued February 20, 1992, which\n\nplaintiffs  signed,  the  court  listed  as  an  \"uncontested\n\nmaterial  fact\" that  the  plaintiffs had  not proffered  any\n\ncompetent  expert   testimony  showing   that   any  of   the\n\ndefendants' products, to which  exposure was alleged,  caused\n\nthe  aplastic anemia.  By  this time, trial  had already been\n\nset  for March 11, 1992.   Defendants and  the district court\n\nwere noticed of plaintiffs'  proposed expert witness on April\n\n24,  1992 two months  after the  discovery deadline  and less\n\nthan one month prior to the start of the trial.\n\n          Were we  to find that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion  in  denying  the motion  for  reconsideration, we\n\nwould  be   flouting  our   own  precedent,   abdicating  our\n\nsupervisory responsibility,  and turning over the  control of\n\ndiscovery  to the lawyers.
