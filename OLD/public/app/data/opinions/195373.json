Wallis, City  of Boston Corporation  Counsel, and\n                    \nWilliam J.  Pidgeon, Jr., Assistant Corporation  Counsel, City of\n                      \nBoston, Law Department on brief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.  Plaintiff  appellant states that he is\n                    \n\na  homeless veteran who resides  in Boston.   He brought this\n\naction  under 42  U.S.C.    1983 claiming  that the  Veterans\n\nServices   Department  for  the  City  of  Boston  wrongfully\n\nsuspended the benefits  to which he was  entitled under Mass.\n\nGen.  L. ch.  115, when  he failed  to provide  a residential\n\naddress within the City.  Plaintiff's request for restoration\n\nof  benefits was denied  and he appealed  to the Commonwealth\n\nOffice of  Veterans' Services.   Shortly after he  filed that\n\nappeal, he  filed this  complaint in district  court alleging\n\nthat  the  suspension  of  benefits violated  state  law  and\n\nregulations1   and    the   Due   Process   Clause   of   the\n\nConstitution.2 \n\n          The  district court granted  the defendants' motion\n\nto dismiss for  failure to  exhaust administrative  remedies.\n\nPlaintiff  argues  that the  dismissal  was  error under  the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Massachusetts veterans' benefits are made payable by  the\nmunicipality where  the veteran  \"resides,\" meaning  that the\nveteran  is  \"present   within  a   city  or  town   .  .   .\nnotwithstanding the lack of a present  abode, with no present\nintention of definite or early removal . . . . \"   Mass. Gen.\nL. ch. 115,    1, 5; 108 CMR 2:02(7).   \n\n2.  Plaintiff  also   charged  a  violation   of  the  Eighth\nAmendment and  a deprivation  of the constitutional  right to\nequal  protection of  the  laws.   We  treat both  claims  as\nsurplusage.   There are no facts alleged to support an Eighth\nAmendment   claim,  and   the  equal   protection   claim  is\ncontradicted  by plaintiff's allegations  that state  law and\npolicy  require equal treatment.  Any  violation of state law\nwould  be correctable in state court. See discussion infra at\n                                                          \n3. \n\n                             -2-\n\ngeneral  principal  that exhaustion  of  state administrative\n\nremedies is not a prerequisite to maintenance of a suit under\n\n  1983.   Patsy  v. Board  of Regents,  457 U.S.  496 (1982);\n                                     \n\nMiller v.  Town of Hull, 878 F.2d  523, 530 (1st Cir.), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 493 U.S. 976 (1989).   To maintain his claim under   \n      \n\n1983,  however,  the  plaintiff   must  allege  a  cognizable\n\nviolation  of the  Due Process  Clause.   \"The constitutional\n\nviolation  actionable under    1983 is not  complete when the\n\ndeprivation occurs; it is  not complete unless and until  the\n\nState fails to provide [suitable post deprivation remedies].\"\n\nZinermon v. Burch, 494  U.S. 113, 126 (1990).   Moreover, the\n                 \n\ncrux  of  plaintiff's  complaint   is  that  the   defendants\n\ndisregarded state law and regulations when they suspended his\n\nbenefits.    Ordinarily, an  \"alleged misuse or  disregard of\n\nstate  law   by  state   officials  does  not   constitute  a\n\ndeprivation of property without constitutional due process. .\n\n.  .   Such  deficiencies, if  they  exist, are  readily  and\n\nadequately correctable  under  state  law  in  state  court.\"\n\nMalachowski v. Keene, 787 F.2d 704  (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n479 U.S. 828 (1986) (citing Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital\n                                                             \n\nv.
