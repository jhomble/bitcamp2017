U.S. Healthcare and two related\n                          \n\ncompanies  (collectively  \"U.S.  Healthcare\")   brought  this\n\nantitrust case  in the district  court against  Healthsource,\n\nInc.,  its founder and one  of its subsidiaries.   Both sides\n\nare  engaged  in  providing medical  services  through health\n\nmaintenance organizations (\"HMOs\") in  New Hampshire.  In its\n\nsuit U.S.  Healthcare challenged an exclusive  dealing clause\n\nin the contracts between the Healthsource HMO and doctors who\n\nprovide primary care for it in New Hampshire.   After a trial\n\nin district  court, the magistrate judge  found no violation,\n\nand U.S. Healthcare appealed.  We affirm.\n\n                       I.  BACKGROUND \n\n     Healthsource New Hampshire is an HMO founded in 1985  by\n\nDr. Norman Payson  and a  group of doctors  in Concord,  N.H.\n\nIts  parent company,  Healthsource,  Inc., is  headed by  Dr.\n\nPayson and it manages or has interests in HMOs in a number of\n\nstates.  We  refer to  both the  parent company  and its  New\n\nHampshire HMO as \"Healthsource.\"\n\n     In  simpler  days, health  care  comprised  a doctor,  a\n\npatient and sometimes a hospital, but the Norman Rockwell era\n\nof medicine  has given  way to  a  new world  of diverse  and\n\ncomplex insurance and provider arrangements.  One of the more\n\nsuccessful  innovations is  the  HMO, which  acts  both as  a\n\nhealth  insurer  and  provider,  charging  employers  a fixed\n\npremium for each employee who subscribes.  To provide medical\n\n                             -2-\n\ncare to subscribers, an HMO of Healthsource's type--sometimes\n\ncalled an individual practice association or \"IPA\" model HMO-\n\n-contracts with independent doctors.  These doctors  continue\n\nto treat other patients,  in contrast to a \"staff\"  model HMO\n\nwhose doctors  would normally  be full-time employees  of the\n\nHMO.  \n\n     HMOs  often can  provide health  care at  lower  cost by\n\nstressing  preventative care, controlling  costs, and driving\n\nhard bargains  with doctors or hospitals  (who thereby obtain\n\nmore   patients   in   exchange   for   a   reduced  charge).\n\nHealthsource, like other HMOs, uses primary care physicians--\n\nusually internists but  sometimes pediatricians or others--as\n\n\"gatekeepers\"  who direct  the patients  to specialists  only\n\nwhen necessary  and who  monitor hospital stays.   Typically,\n\nthe contracting primary care physicians do not charge  by the\n\nvisit but are paid  \"capitations\" by the HMO, a  fixed amount\n\nper  month for  each patient  who selects  the doctor  as the\n\npatient's  primary care  physician.   Unlike  a patient  with\n\nordinary health insurance, the HMO patient  is limited to the\n\npanel of doctors who have contracted with the HMO.\n\n     There  are  familiar  alternatives  to  HMOs.    At  the\n\n\"financing\"  end, these include traditional insurance company\n\npolicies that reimburse patients for doctor or hospital bills\n\nwithout  limiting the patient's choice of  doctor, as well as\n\nBlue Cross/Blue  Shield plans  of various types  and Medicare\n\n                             -3-\n\nand  Medicaid programs.  At the \"provider\" end, there is also\n\ndiversity.  Doctors may now form so-called preferred provider\n\norganizations, which may include  peer review and other joint\n\nactivities, and contract together to provide medical services\n\nto large buyers like  Blue Cross or to \"network\"  model HMOs.\n\nThere are  also ordinary group  medical practices.   And,  of\n\ncourse, there are still doctors engaged solely in independent\n\npractice on a fee-for-service basis.\n\n     Healthsource's  HMO operations in  New Hampshire  were a\n\nsuccess.  At the time of suit, Healthsource was the only non-\n\nstaff HMO in the  state with 47,000 patients (some  in nearby\n\nareas of Massachusetts), representing  about 5 percent of New\n\nHampshire's  population.    Stringent controls  gave  it  low\n\ncosts,  including a  low  hospital utilization  rate; and  it\n\nsought  and  obtained  favorable  rates  from  hospitals  and\n\nspecialists.      Giving   doctors   a   further   stake   in\n\nHealthsource's success  and incentive to  contain costs,  Dr.\n\nPayson apparently  encouraged doctors to  become stockholders\n\nas well, and  at least 400  did so.  By  1989 Dr. Payson  was\n\nproposing to make Healthsource  a publicly traded company, in\n\npart to permit greater liquidity for its doctor shareholders.\n\n     U.S.  Healthcare is  also in  the business  of operating\n\nHMOs.  U.S.  Healthcare, Inc.,  the parent of  the other  two\n\nplaintiff  companies--U.S.  Healthcare, Inc.  (Massachusetts)\n\nand  U.S.  Healthcare  of  New Hampshire,  Inc.--may  be  the\n\n                             -4-\n\nlargest  publicly  held  provider  of  HMO  services  in  the\n\ncountry, serving  over one million patients  and having total\n\n1990 revenues of well over a billion dollars.  Prior to 1990,\n\nits Massachusetts subsidiary had  done some recruiting of New\n\nHampshire  doctors  to  act  as primary  care  providers  for\n\nborder-area residents  served by  its Massachusetts HMO.   In\n\n1989, U.S. Healthcare had a substantial interest in expanding\n\ninto New Hampshire.  \n\n     Dr.  Payson  was aware  in the  fall  of 1989  that HMOs\n\noperating in other states  were thinking about offering their\n\nservices  in New Hampshire.  He was also concerned that, when\n\nHealthsource  went public,  many  of its  doctor-shareholders\n\nwould  sell   their  stock,  decreasing  their   interest  in\n\nHealthsource and their incentive to control its costs.  After\n\nconsidering alternative incentives, Dr. Payson  and the HMO's\n\nchief operating officer conceived the exclusivity clause that\n\nhas prompted this litigation.  Shortly after the Healthsource\n\npublic offering in  November 1989, Healthsource  notified its\n\npanel doctors that they would receive greater compensation if\n\nthey agreed not to serve any other HMO.\n\n     The  new  contract  term, effective  January  26,  1990,\n\nprovided for  an increase in the  standard monthly capitation\n\npaid to  each primary  care physician, for  each Healthsource\n\nHMO patient cared for by that doctor, if the doctor agreed to\n\n                             -5-\n\nthe  following  optional  paragraph  in   the  basic  doctor-\n                        \n\nHealthsource agreement:\n\n     11.01 Exclusive Services  of Physicians.  Physician\n                                            \n     agrees  during the  term of  this Agreement  not to\n     serve  as a  participating physician for  any other\n     HMO  plan;   this  shall  not,   however,  preclude\n     Physician  from   providing  professional  courtesy\n     coverage arrangements for brief periods of  time or\n     emergency services to members of other HMO plans.\n\nA doctor who adopted  the option remained free to  serve non-\n\nHMO patients  under  ordinary indemnity  insurance  policies,\n\nunder  Blue  Cross\\Blue  Shield  plans,  or  under  preferred\n\nprovider  arrangements.   A  doctor who  accepted the  option\n\ncould also return to  non-exclusive status by giving notice.1\n\n     Although  Healthsource  capitation  amounts   varied,  a\n\ndoctor   who  accepted   the  exclusivity   option  generally\n\nincreased his  or her capitation  payments by  a little  more\n\nthan $1 per patient  per month; the magistrate judge  put the\n\namount at  $1.16  and said  that  it represented  an  average\n\nincrease of  about 14 percent as  compared with non-exclusive\n\nstatus.  The dollar benefit of  exclusivity for an individual\n\ndoctor  obviously  varies with  the  number  of HMO  patients\n\nhandled by the doctor.  Many of the doctors had less than 100\n\nHealthsource patients while about 50 of them had 200 or more.\n\n                    \n\n     1The  original notice  period was  180 days.   This  was\nreduced to  30 days in March  or April 1991.   It appears, at\nleast  in  practice,  that  a  doctor  could  switch to  non-\nexclusive  status more rapidly by returning some of the extra\ncompensation previously paid.\n\n                             -6-\n\nAbout 250  doctors, or  87 percent of  Healthsource's primary\n\ncare physicians, opted for exclusivity.\n\n     U.S.  Healthcare through  its  New Hampshire  subsidiary\n\napplied  for a New Hampshire  state license in  the spring of\n\n1990, following an earlier  application by its  Massachusetts\n\nsubsidiary.  A cease and desist order was entered against it,\n\nlimiting its  marketing efforts, because of  premature claims\n\nthat it  had approval to operate in the state.  The cease and\n\ndesist order  was withdrawn  on February  15,  1991, and  the\n\nlicense  issued  on  February  21,  1991,  subject  to  later\n\napproval  of marketing materials.  The present suit was filed\n\nin district court by U.S. Healthcare against Healthsource and\n\nDr. Payson on March  12, 1991.  By mid-1991,  U.S. Healthcare\n\nhad  only two  New  Hampshire \"accounts\"  and  only about  18\n\nprimary care physicians.\n\n     In  the district court,  U.S. Healthcare  challenged the\n\nexclusivity clause under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act,\n\n15 U.S.C.     1-2, and  under state antitrust  and tort  law.\n\nThe parties  stipulated to  trial before a  magistrate judge.\n\nAfter discovery,  two separate weeks of  trial were conducted\n\nin August and September 1991.  In a decision filed on January\n\n30, 1992, the  magistrate judge found  for the defendants  on\n\nall counts.  This appeal followed.\n\n                        II. DISCUSSION\n\n                             -7-\n\n     In this court,  U.S. Healthcare attacks the  exclusivity\n\nclause primarily  as a  per se  or near per  se violation  of\n\nsection 1; accordingly we begin by examining the case through\n\nthe per se or  \"quick look\" lenses urged by  U.S. Healthcare.\n\nWe then  consider the claim  recast in the  more conventional\n\nframework of  Tampa Electric Co.  v. Nashville Coal  Co., 365\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  320   (1961),  the  Supreme  Court's   latest  word  on\n\nexclusivity contracts, appraising them under section 1's rule\n\nof reason.  Finally,  we address U.S. Healthcare's claims  of\n\nsection 2 violation and  its attacks on the market-definition\n\nfindings of the magistrate judge.  \n\n     The Per Se  and \"Quick Look\" Claims.   U.S. Healthcare's\n                                        \n\nchallenge to  the exclusivity clause, calling it  first a per\n\nse violation  and later  a monopolization offense,  invokes a\n\nsignal  aspect  of antitrust  analysis: the  same competitive\n\npractice may be reviewed  under several different rubrics and\n\na plaintiff may prevail by establishing a claim under any one\n\nof  them.   Thus, while  an exclusivity arrangement  is often\n\nconsidered  under  section 1's  rule of  reason, it  might in\n\ntheory play  a role in a  per se violation of  section 1, cf.\n                                                            \n\nEastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Ass'n v. United States,\n                                                            \n\n234 U.S. 600 (1914), or as  an element in attempted or actual\n\nmonopolization, United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.,\n                                                            \n\n110 F.  Supp. 295 (D. Mass. 1953), aff'd per curiam, 347 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n                             -8-\n\n521  (1954).   But  each rubric  has  its own  conditions and\n\nrequirements of proof.\n\n     We begin, as U.S. Healthcare does, with the per se rules\n\nof section 1 of the Sherman Act.  It is a familiar story that\n\nCongress left the  development of the Sherman  Act largely to\n\nthe courts and they in turn responded by  classifying certain\n\npractices as per se  violations under section 1.   Today, the\n\nonly serious candidates for this label are  price (or output)\n\nfixing agreements  and  certain group  boycotts or  concerted\n                               \n\nrefusals to  deal.2    The advantage to  a plaintiff is  that\n\ngiven  a per se violation, proof of the defendant's power, of\n\nillicit purpose and of anticompetitive effect are all said to\n\nbe irrelevant,  see United  States v. Socony-Vacuum  Oil Co.,\n                                                            \n\n310 U.S.  150 (1940); the  disadvantage is the  difficulty of\n\nsqueezing a practice into the ever narrowing per se nitch.\n\n     U.S. Healthcare's main argument  for per se treatment is\n\nto  describe the exclusivity clause  as a group  boycott.  To\n\nunderstand why the claim  ultimately fails one must begin  by\n\nrecognizing that per se condemnation is  not visited on every\n\narrangement  that might, as a matter of language, be called a\n\ngroup boycott  or concerted refusal  to deal.   Rather, today\n\nthat designation  is principally reserved for  cases in which\n\n                    \n\n     2Tying is sometimes  also described as a  per se offense\nbut, since some element  of power must be shown  and defenses\nare  effectively available, \"quasi\" per se  might be a better\nlabel.   See Eastman  Kodak Co. v.  Image Technical Services,\n                                                             \nInc., 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992).  \n   \n\n                             -9-\n\ncompetitors agree with each other not to deal with a supplier\n\nor distributor  if it  continues to serve  a competitor  whom\n\nthey  seek to injure.  This is the \"secondary boycott\" device\n\nused in  such classic boycott cases as  Eastern States Retail\n                                                             \n\nLumber  Dealers'  Ass'n,  and Fashion  Originators'  Guild of\n                                                             \n\nAmerica, Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457 (1941).\n                    \n\n     We doubt  that the  modern Supreme  Court would use  the\n\nboycott  label to describe, or the rubric to condemn, a joint\n\nventure  among competitors in which participation was allowed\n\nto some but not  all, compare Northwest Wholesale Stationers,\n                                                             \n\nInc. v.

What  is\n\neven more  clear is that  a purely  vertical arrangement,  by\n\nwhich  (for example) a supplier  or dealer makes an agreement\n\nexclusively to supply or serve a manufacturer, is not a group\n\nboycott.

Were the law otherwise, every distributor or retailer\n\nwho  agreed with a manufacturer  to handle only  one brand of\n\ntelevision  or bicycle would be engaged in a group boycott of\n\nother manufacturers.\n\n     There are multiple reasons why the law permits (or, more\n\naccurately, does not condemn per se) vertical exclusivity; it\n\n                             -10-\n\nis enough to say here that the incentives for  and effects of\n\nsuch arrangements  are usually more benign  than a horizontal\n\narrangement among competitors that none of them will supply a\n\ncompany that deals  with one  of their competitors.   No  one\n\nwould think twice about  a doctor agreeing to work  full time\n\nfor a  staff HMO, an  extreme case  of vertical  exclusivity.\n\nImagine, by contrast, the motives and effects of a horizontal\n\nagreement by  all of the doctors  in a town not to  work at a\n\nhospital that  serves a  staff HMO  which  competes with  the\n\ndoctors.   \n\n     In this case, the exclusivity arrangements challenged by\n\nU.S. Healthcare are vertical in  form, that is, they comprise\n\nindividual  promises  to  Healthsource made  by  each  doctor\n\nselecting  the option  not to  offer his  or her  services to\n\nanother HMO.    The closest  that U.S. Healthcare  gets to  a\n\npossible  horizontal  case  is  this: it  suggests  that  the\n\nexclusivity clause in question, although vertical in form, is\n\nin substance an implicit  horizontal agreement by the doctors\n\ninvolved.  U.S. Healthcare appears to argue that stockholder-\n\ndoctors dominate Healthsource and,  in order to protect their\n\nindividual interests (as  stockholders in Healthsource), they\n\nagreed  (in their capacity as  doctors) not to  deal with any\n\nother HMO  that might  compete with  Healthsource.   We agree\n\nthat  such  a  horizontal  arrangement, if  devoid  of  joint\n\nventure efficiencies, might warrant per se condemnation.  \n\n                             -11-\n\n     The  difficulty is that there  is no evidence  of such a\n\nhorizontal agreement in this  case.  Although U.S. Healthcare\n\nnotes   that   doctor-stockholders    predominate   on    the\n\nHealthsource board that adopted  the option, there is nothing\n\nto  show that  the clause  was devised  or encouraged  by the\n\npanel doctors.   On the  contrary, the record  indicates that\n\nDr.  Payson  and   Healthsource's  chief  operating   officer\n\ndeveloped the option  to serve Healthsource's own  interests.\n\nFormally  vertical arrangements  used to  disguise horizontal\n\nones are not unknown, see Interstate  Circuit, Inc. v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 306 U.S. 208 (1939), but U.S. Healthcare has supplied\n      \n\nus with no evidence of such a masquerade in this case.\n\n     There  is   less  to  be  said   for  U.S.  Healthcare's\n\nalternative argument that, if per se treatment is not proper,\n\nthen at least the exclusivity clause can be  condemned almost\n\nas swiftly based  on \"a quick look.\"   Citing FTC  v. Indiana\n                                                             \n\nFederation of  Dentists,  476 U.S.  447 (1986),  and NCAA  v.\n                                                         \n\nBoard of  Regents, 468 U.S. 85 (1984), U.S. Healthcare argues\n                 \n\nthat  the exclusivity clause is  so patently bad  that even a\n\nbrief  glance at  its impact,  lack  of business  benefit and\n\nanticompetitive  intent suffice  to  condemn it.   The  cases\n\nrelied on provide little  help to  U.S. Healthcare  and, even\n\non  its own  version  of those  cases,  the facts  would  not\n\nconceivably  justify  a  \"quick  look\"  condemnation  of  the\n\nclause.\n\n                             -12-\n\n     In  the  cited   cases,  the   Supreme  Court   actually\n\ncontracted  the  per  se rule  by  refusing  to  apply it  to\n\nhorizontal agreements  that involved price  and output fixing\n\n(television rights  by NCAA members) or the  setting of other\n\nterms of trade  (refusal of dentists by  agreement to provide\n\nx-rays  to  insurers).     Given  the  unusual  contexts  (an\n\ninterdependent sports league in one case; medical care in the\n\nother), the  Court declined  to condemn the  arrangements per\n\nse, without at least weighing the alleged justifications.  At\n\nthe same time it  required only the briefest  inspection (the\n\ncited \"quick look\") for  the Court to reject the  excuses and\n\nstrike  down the  agreements.

To  that\n\nsubject we now turn.\n\n     Rule of  Reason.  Exclusive  dealing arrangements,  like\n                    \n\ninformation exchanges or standard settings, come in a variety\n\nof  forms and  serve a  range  of objectives.    Many of  the\n\npurposes are benign, such as assurance of supply  or outlets,\n\nenhanced ability to plan, reduced transaction costs, creation\n\nof  dealer loyalty, and the like.  See Standard Stations, 337\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 307.  But there is one common danger for competition:\n\nan  exclusive  arrangement may  \"foreclose\"  so  much of  the\n\navailable supply or outlet capacity that existing competitors\n\nor new entrants may be limited or excluded and, under certain\n\ncircumstances,  this may  reinforce  market  power and  raise\n\nprices for consumers.  \n\n     Although   the   Supreme   Court   once  said   that   a\n\n\"substantial\"  percentage foreclosure of suppliers or outlets\n\nwould violate section 1, Standard Stations, the Court's Tampa\n                                                             \n\ndecision effectively replaced  any such quantitative  test by\n\nan  open-ended  inquiry into  competitive  impact.   What  is\n\nrequired  under Tampa is to determine \"the probable effect of\n                     \n\nthe [exclusive]  contract on  the relevant area  of effective\n\ncompetition,  taking into  account . .  . .

See ABA Antitrust\n                                               \n\nSection, Antitrust  Law Developments 172-73,  176-78 (3d  ed.\n\n1992) (collecting cases).\n\n     On  this appeal  we  are handicapped  in appraising  the\n\nextent and impact of  the foreclosure wrought by Healthsource\n\nbecause  U.S.  Healthcare  has  not  chosen  to  present  its\n\nargument in these traditional terms.  Tampa is not even cited\n                                           \n\nin the opening or reply briefs.  Some useful facts pertaining\n\nto  the extent  of the  foreclosure are  adverted to  in U.S.\n\nHealthcare's  opening  \"statement  of  the  case\"  but  never\n\nseriously  developed in  the argument  section of  its brief.\n\nSince the brief itself also describes countervailing evidence\n\nof Healthsource, something more is  assuredly needed.  In the\n\ntwo paragraphs  of its \"quick look\"  formulation addressed to\n\n\"anticompetitive impact,\" U.S. Healthcare simply asserts that\n\ncompetitive impact  has already  been discussed and  that the\n\nexclusivity clause has  completely foreclosed U.S. Healthcare\n\nand any other non-staff HMO from operation in New Hampshire.\n\n     This  is not a persuasive treatment of a difficult issue\n\nor, rather, a host of issues.  First, the extent to which the\n\nclause operated economically to restrict doctors is a serious\n\nquestion.3   True,  most doctors  signed up  for it;  but who\n\n                    \n\n     3Even with no notice period, Healthsource's differential\npricing policy--paying  more to those  who exclusively  serve\nHealthsource--would disadvantage competing HMOs.  Some courts\n\n                             -15-\n\nwould not take the extra compensation  when no competing non-\n\nstaff HMO was  yet operating?   The extent  of the  financial\n\nincentive to remain in an  exclusive status is unclear, since\n\nit varies with patient  load, and the least loaded  (and thus\n\nleast constrained  by the  clause) doctors would  normally be\n\nthe  best  candidates  for  a competing  HMO.    Healthsource\n\nsuggests that  by relatively modest amounts,  U.S. Healthcare\n\ncould offset  the exclusivity bonus for  a substantial number\n\nof  Healthsource  doctors.    U.S.  Healthcare's reply  brief\n\noffers no response.  \n\n     Second, along with the  economic inducement is the issue\n\nof duration.  Normally an exclusivity clause terminable on 30\n\ndays' notice would be close to a de minimus constraint (Tampa\n                                                             \n\ninvolved a 20-year contract, and  one year is sometimes taken\n\nas the trigger  for close scrutiny).   On the other  hand, it\n\nmay be that  the original 180-day  clause did frustrate  U.S.\n\nHealthcare's initial efforts to enlist panel doctors, without\n\nwhom it would  be hard to sign up employers.   Perhaps even a\n\n30-day  clause  would  have  this  effect,  especially  if  a\n\nreimbursement penalty were visited  on doctors switching back\n\nto non-exclusive status.  Once again, U.S. Healthcare's brief\n\noffers conclusions  and a few record  references, but neither\n\n                    \n\nhesitate to apply the  exclusivity label to such arrangements\nbecause  there  is no  continuing  promise not  to  deal (see\nAntitrust Developments, supra, at  176), but the differential\n                             \npricing  plan is  unquestionably part  of  a contract  and so\nsubject to section 1, whatever label may be applied.\n\n                             -16-\n\nthe  precise  operation  of the  clause  nor  its effects  on\n\nindividual doctors are clearly settled.\n\n     Third, even  assuming that the  financial incentive  and\n\nduration  of the  exclusivity clause did  remove many  of the\n\nHealthsource  doctors  from the  reach  of  new HMOs,  it  is\n\nunclear how much this foreclosure impairs the ability  of new\n\nHMOs to  operate.    Certainly the  number  of  primary  care\n\nphysicians  tied to Healthsource  was significant--one figure\n\nsuggested  is 25  percent or  more of  all such  primary care\n\nphysicians  in New  Hampshire--but this  still leaves  a much\n\nlarger number not  tied to Healthsource.  It may  be, as U.S.\n\nHealthcare  urges,  that  many of  the  remaining \"available\"\n\ndoctors cannot  fairly be counted (e.g.,  those employed full\n                                       \n\ntime elsewhere, or reaching retirement, or unwilling to serve\n\nHMOs at all).   But  the dimensions of  this limitation  were\n\ndisputed  and, by the same  token, new doctors are constantly\n\nentering the market with an immediate need for patients.\n\n     U.S. Healthcare lays great stress upon claims, supported\n\nby some meeting notes of Healthsource staff members, that the\n\nlatter was aware of new HMO entry and conscious that new HMOs\n\nlike  U.S.  Healthcare could  be  adversely  affected by  the\n\nexclusivity clause.4   Healthsource  in turn says  that these\n\n                    \n\n     4Two examples  of these  staff notes give  their flavor:\n\"Looking at '90 rates - and a deterent [sic] to joining other\nHMOs (like Healthcare)\"; and \"amend contract (sending this or\nnext  week) based on  exclusivity.

Motive can, of course,\n\nbe a guide  to expected  effects, but effects  are still  the\n\ncentral concern of the antitrust laws, and motive is mainly a\n\nclue,  see Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n227  (1st  Cir. 1983).   This  case  itself suggests  how far\n\nmotives in business arrangement  may be mixed, ambiguous, and\n\nsubject to dispute.   In any event, under Tampa  the ultimate\n                                               \n\nissue in  exclusivity cases remains the  issue of foreclosure\n\nand its consequences.\n\n     Absent   a   compelling   showing  of   foreclosure   of\n\nsubstantial dimensions, we think  there is no need for  us to\n\npursue any  inquiry into  Healthsource's precise  motives for\n\nthe clause, the existence and measure of any claimed benefits\n\nfrom exclusivity, the balance  between harms and benefits, or\n\nthe possible existence and  relevance of any less restrictive\n\nmeans of achieving the benefits.  We are similarly spared the\n\ndifficulty of assessing the  fact that the clause  is limited\n\nto  HMOs, a fact  from which more  than one  inference may be\n\ndrawn.   The point is  that proof of  substantial foreclosure\n\nand  of  \"probable  immediate  and  future  effects\"  is  the\n\nessential basis under  Tampa for an attack  on an exclusivity\n                            \n\nclause.  U.S. Healthcare has not supplied that basis.\n\n                    \n\nalready . . . .\"\n\n                             -18-\n\n     In formal terms U.S.  Healthcare has preserved on appeal\n\nits claim that the exclusivity clause  unreasonably restrains\n\ncompetition  in violation  of  section 1.    That concept  is\n\nembraced  by  its complaint,  and  the  limited depiction  of\n\nevidence  in its  appellate  briefs stirs  curiosity, if  not\n\nsuspicion.  But  putting to one  side its  per se claims  and\n\nalleged  market  definition errors,  U.S.  Healthcare's basic\n\nargument  in this court  must be that  the evidence compelled\n                                                             \n\nthe  magistrate judge to  find substantial foreclosure having\n\nan  unreasonable   adverse  effect  on   competition.    U.S.\n\nHealthcare,  as  plaintiff at  trial  and  appellant in  this\n\ncourt,  had  the burden  of  fully  mustering the  facts  and\n\napplying the  analysis to establish such a claim.  It has not\n\ndone so.\n\n     In this  discussion, we  have placed little  weight upon\n\nthe  formal  finding  of   the  magistrate  judge  that  \"the\n\n[exclusivity] restriction does not constitute an unreasonable\n\nrestraint of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\"   His\n\nfinding  rested primarily  on the  premise that  whatever the\n\nimpact  of the clause on HMOs, ample competition remains in a\n\nproperly defined market,  which he found to  be one embracing\n\nall  health   care  offered  throughout  the   state  of  New\n\nHampshire.5  On this view of the antitrust laws,  it does not\n\n                    \n\n     5On  the other hand, we do  not accept U.S. Healthcare's\neffort  to salvage something from the decision by arguing the\nmagistrate judge found substantial  foreclosure in fact.  For\n\n                             -19-\n\nmatter whether substantial foreclosure of new entrants occurs\n\nso long  as widespread  competition prevails in  the relevant\n\nmarket, thereby protecting consumers.6\n\n     Whether  the  law requires  such  a  further showing  of\n\nlikely impact on consumers is open  to debate.  Our own  case\n\nlaw  is not crystal clear  on this issue.   Compare Interface\n                                                             \n\nGroup, Inc. v.

Ultimately  the\n                          \n\nissue turns upon antitrust  policy, where a permanent tension\n\nprevails  between  the \"no  sparrow  shall  fall\" concept  of\n\nantitrust,  see Klor's, 359 U.S. at 213 (violation \"not to be\n                      \n\ntolerated  merely because  the  victim is  just one  merchant\n\nwhose business is so small that his destruction makes  little\n\ndifference  to the  economy\"),  and the  ascendant view  that\n\nantitrust  protects  \"competition,  not  competitors\".

One  reason is that the concept,  even in\n\nthe pristine  formulation of economists,  is deliberately  an\n\nattempt  to  oversimplify--for  working   purposes--the  very\n\ncomplex economic interactions between a number of differently\n\nsituated  buyers and  sellers,  each of  whom in  reality has\n\ndifferent costs,  needs, and substitutes.   See United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  E.I.  du  Pont De  Nemours  &amp;  Co, 351  U.S.  377 (1956).\n                                     \n\nFurther, when  lawyers and judges  take hold of  the concept,\n\nthey  impose   on  it  nuances  and   formulas  that  reflect\n\nadministrative and antitrust policy  goals.  This adaption is\n\nlegitimate (economists have no patent on the concept), but it\n\nmeans that normative and descriptive ideas become intertwined\n\nin the process of market definition.\n\n     Nevertheless,   rational   treatment   is  assisted   by\n\nremembering  to ask, in defining the market, why we are doing\n                                                \n\nso: that is, what is the antitrust question in this case that\n\nmarket  definition aims  to answer?   This  threshold inquiry\n\nhelps  resolve U.S.  Healthcare's claim  that  the magistrate\n\njudge  erred at the outset  by directing his  analysis to the\n\nissue whether HMOs or health  care financing was the relevant\n\nproduct  market.    This  approach,   says  U.S.  Healthcare,\n\nmistakenly  focuses on  the  sale of  health  care to  buyers\n                                 \n\nwhereas its  concern is Healthsource's buying  power in tying\n                                             \n\nup doctors needed by other HMOs in order to compete. \n\n                             -22-\n\n     The magistrate  judge's approach  was correct.   One can\n\nmonopolize a  product as either a seller or a buyer; but as a\n\nbuyer of doctor services,  Healthsource could never achieve a\n\nmonopoly (monopsony is  the technical term),  because doctors\n\nhave  too   many  alternative  buyers  for  their  services.7\n\nRather,  the only way to cast Healthsource as a monopolist is\n\nto  argue,  as  U.S.  Healthcare  apparently  did,  that  HMO\n\nservices  (or  even  IPA  HMOs) are  a  separate  health care\n\nproduct sold  to consumers  such as employers  and employees.\n            \n\nIf so, it  might become possible  (depending on market  share\n\nand other  factors) to describe Healthsource  as a monopolist\n\nor  potential  monopolist in  the sale  of  HMO (or  IPA HMO)\n\nservices in  New Hampshire, using the  exclusionary clause to\n\nfoster or reinforce the monopoly.\n\n     Thus,  the  magistrate judge  asked the  right question.\n\nEven  so U.S. Healthcare argues that he gave the wrong answer\n\nin finding that HMOs were not a  separate market (it uses the\n\nphrase  \"submarket\" but this does not alter the issue).  This\n\nis a legitimate contention  and U.S. Healthcare has  at least\n\n                    \n\n     7U.S.  Healthcare,  of  course, is  not  concerned  with\nHealthsource's ability  as a monopsonist  to exploit doctors;\nit is concerned with its own ability to find doctors to serve\nit. The latter  question--one of foreclosure--depends  on the\navailable supply  of doctors,  the constraint imposed  by the\nexclusivity  clause, the  prospect for  entry of  new doctors\ninto the market, and similar issues.  Whether U.S. Healthcare\nis foreclosed, however, does  not depend on whether consumers\ntreat HMOs  as a part of health care financing or as a unique\nand separate product.\n\n                             -23-\n\nsome basis  for it:   HMOs are often cheaper  than other care\n\nmethods because they emphasize illness prevention  and severe\n\ncost  control.   U.S.  Healthcare also  seeks to  distinguish\n\ncases defining  a broader  \"health  care financing  market\"--\n\ncases heavily relied on by the magistrate judge--as involving\n\nquite  different types of antitrust claims.   See, e.g., Ball\n                                                             \n\nMemorial Hosp.,  Inc. v.  Mutual Hosp.  Ins., Inc., 784  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1325  (7th Cir. 1986).  Once again,  we agree that the nature\n\nof the claim can affect the proper market definition.\n\n     The  problem with  U.S.  Healthcare's argument  is  that\n\ndifferences in  cost and quality between  products create the\n\npossibility of  separate markets, not  the certainty.   A car\n\nwith  more features and a higher price is, within some range,\n\nin the  same market  as one  with less  features and  a lower\n\nprice.     The  issue  is  sometimes   described  as  one  of\n\ninterchangeability   of  products  or  services,  see  duPont\n                                                             \n\n(discussing  cross-elasticity  of   demand),  although   this\n\nformula is itself only an aid in trying to infer the shape of\n\nthe invisible demand curve facing the accused monopolist.  In\n\npractice, the frustrating but  routine question how to define\n\nthe product market  is answered in antitrust  cases by asking\n\nexpert  economists  to  testify.    Here,  the  issue  for an\n\neconomist would  be whether a  sole supplier of  HMO services\n\n(or IPA  HMOs if that  is U.S. Healthcare's  proposed market)\n\ncould raise price far enough over cost, and for a long enough\n\n                             -24-\n\nperiod, to enjoy monopoly  profits.  Usage patterns, customer\n\nsurveys,  actual profit levels,  comparison of features, ease\n\nof entry, and many other facts are pertinent in answering the\n\nquestion.\n\n     Once again,  U.S. Healthcare  has not  made its  case in\n\nthis court.  The (unquantified) cost advantage of HMOs is the\n\nonly important fact supplied;  consumers might, or might not,\n\nregard this benefit as just about offset by the limits placed\n\non  the patient's choice  of doctors.  To  be sure, there was\n\nsome  expert testimony in the district court on both sides of\n\nthe market  definition issue.   But if  there is any  case in\n\nwhich counsel has the obligation to cull the record, organize\n\nthe  facts, and present them in the framework of a persuasive\n\nlegal  argument, it  is a  sophisticated antitrust  case like\n\nthis one.  Without such a showing on appeal, we  have limited\n\nability  to reconstruct so complex  a record ourselves and no\n\nbasis for overturning the magistrate judge.\n\n     Absent the showing of  a properly defined product market\n\nin which  Healthsource could approach monopoly  size, we have\n\nno reason to consider the geographic dimension of the market.\n\nIf  health  care financing  is  the  product market,  as  the\n\nmagistrate  judge determined,  plainly  Healthsource  has  no\n\nmonopoly or anything close  to it, given the number  of other\n\nproviders  in New  Hampshire, such  as insurers,  staff HMOs,\n\nBlue  Cross/Blue  Shield and  individual  doctors.   This  is\n\n                             -25-\n\nequally  so whether  the  geographic market  is southern  New\n\nHampshire  (as U.S. Healthcare claims) or the whole state (as\n\nthe magistrate judge found).\n\n                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n     Once  the federal  antitrust claims  are  found wanting,\n\nthis appeal is resolved.  U.S. Healthcare offers no authority\n\nto  suggest that  New Hampshire  antitrust law  diverges from\n\nfederal law;  indeed, the state statute  encourages a uniform\n\nconstruction.   N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.    356:14.   As for the\n\nstate  tort-law claims, primarily interference with potential\n\ncontractual   relationships,   the  magistrate   judge  dealt\n\neffectively  with them,  and U.S.  Healthcare says  little on\n\nappeal  to undercut his dismissal of those counts.  Given the\n\narguments made and the record evidence arrayed in this court,\n\naffirmance of  the magistrate judge's judgment  on all counts\n\nis clearly in order.\n\n     Nevertheless,  we  do  not  think  that  this  case  was\n\ninherently frivolous.  The  timing and original 180-day reach\n\nof the  exclusivity clause could reasonably excite suspicion;\n\nthe clause may  have some  impact though the  extent of  that\n\nimpact remains  unclear; and  the motives of  Healthsource in\n\nadopting the clause  may well have  been mixed.   Competition\n\nremains an essential force in controlling costs and improving\n\nquality  in health  care.  Courts are  properly available  to\n\nsettle  claims  that  one   business  device  or  another  is\n\n                             -26-\n\nunlawfully  suppressing competition  in this  vital industry.\n\nAlthough  U.S. Healthcare's per se shortcut has taken it to a\n\ndead  end, we  have addressed  the antitrust  issues at  such\n\nlength precisely because of the importance of the subject.\n\n     Affirmed.  \n             \n\n                             -27-\n",

U.S. Healthcare and two related\n                          \n\ncompanies  (collectively  \"U.S.  Healthcare\")   brought  this\n\nantitrust case  in the district  court against  Healthsource,\n\nInc.,  its founder and one  of its subsidiaries.   Both sides\n\nare  engaged  in  providing medical  services  through health\n\nmaintenance organizations (\"HMOs\") in  New Hampshire.  In its\n\nsuit U.S.  Healthcare challenged an exclusive  dealing clause\n\nin the contracts between the Healthsource HMO and doctors who\n\nprovide primary care for it in New Hampshire.   After a trial\n\nin district  court, the magistrate judge  found no violation,\n\nand U.S. Healthcare appealed.  We affirm.\n\n                       I.  BACKGROUND \n\n     Healthsource New Hampshire is an HMO founded in 1985  by\n\nDr. Norman Payson  and a  group of doctors  in Concord,  N.H.\n\nIts  parent company,  Healthsource,  Inc., is  headed by  Dr.\n\nPayson and it manages or has interests in HMOs in a number of\n\nstates.  We  refer to  both the  parent company  and its  New\n\nHampshire HMO as \"Healthsource.\"\n\n     In  simpler  days, health  care  comprised  a doctor,  a\n\npatient and sometimes a hospital, but the Norman Rockwell era\n\nof medicine  has given  way to  a  new world  of diverse  and\n\ncomplex insurance and provider arrangements.  One of the more\n\nsuccessful  innovations is  the  HMO, which  acts  both as  a\n\nhealth  insurer  and  provider,  charging  employers  a fixed\n\npremium for each employee who subscribes.  To provide medical\n\n                             -2-\n\ncare to subscribers, an HMO of Healthsource's type--sometimes\n\ncalled an individual practice association or \"IPA\" model HMO-\n\n-contracts with independent doctors.  These doctors  continue\n\nto treat other patients,  in contrast to a \"staff\"  model HMO\n\nwhose doctors  would normally  be full-time employees  of the\n\nHMO.  \n\n     HMOs  often can  provide health  care at  lower  cost by\n\nstressing  preventative care, controlling  costs, and driving\n\nhard bargains  with doctors or hospitals  (who thereby obtain\n\nmore   patients   in   exchange   for   a   reduced  charge).\n\nHealthsource, like other HMOs, uses primary care physicians--\n\nusually internists but  sometimes pediatricians or others--as\n\n\"gatekeepers\"  who direct  the patients  to specialists  only\n\nwhen necessary  and who  monitor hospital stays.   Typically,\n\nthe contracting primary care physicians do not charge  by the\n\nvisit but are paid  \"capitations\" by the HMO, a  fixed amount\n\nper  month for  each patient  who selects  the doctor  as the\n\npatient's  primary care  physician.   Unlike  a patient  with\n\nordinary health insurance, the HMO patient  is limited to the\n\npanel of doctors who have contracted with the HMO.\n\n     There  are  familiar  alternatives  to  HMOs.    At  the\n\n\"financing\"  end, these include traditional insurance company\n\npolicies that reimburse patients for doctor or hospital bills\n\nwithout  limiting the patient's choice of  doctor, as well as\n\nBlue Cross/Blue  Shield plans  of various types  and Medicare\n\n                             -3-\n\nand  Medicaid programs.  At the \"provider\" end, there is also\n\ndiversity.  Doctors may now form so-called preferred provider\n\norganizations, which may include  peer review and other joint\n\nactivities, and contract together to provide medical services\n\nto large buyers like  Blue Cross or to \"network\"  model HMOs.\n\nThere are  also ordinary group  medical practices.   And,  of\n\ncourse, there are still doctors engaged solely in independent\n\npractice on a fee-for-service basis.\n\n     Healthsource's  HMO operations in  New Hampshire  were a\n\nsuccess.  At the time of suit, Healthsource was the only non-\n\nstaff HMO in the  state with 47,000 patients (some  in nearby\n\nareas of Massachusetts), representing  about 5 percent of New\n\nHampshire's  population.    Stringent controls  gave  it  low\n\ncosts,  including a  low  hospital utilization  rate; and  it\n\nsought  and  obtained  favorable  rates  from  hospitals  and\n\nspecialists.      Giving   doctors   a   further   stake   in\n\nHealthsource's success  and incentive to  contain costs,  Dr.\n\nPayson apparently  encouraged doctors to  become stockholders\n\nas well, and  at least 400  did so.  By  1989 Dr. Payson  was\n\nproposing to make Healthsource  a publicly traded company, in\n\npart to permit greater liquidity for its doctor shareholders.\n\n     U.S.  Healthcare is  also in  the business  of operating\n\nHMOs.  U.S.  Healthcare, Inc.,  the parent of  the other  two\n\nplaintiff  companies--U.S.  Healthcare, Inc.  (Massachusetts)\n\nand  U.S.  Healthcare  of  New Hampshire,  Inc.--may  be  the\n\n                             -4-\n\nlargest  publicly  held  provider  of  HMO  services  in  the\n\ncountry, serving  over one million patients  and having total\n\n1990 revenues of well over a billion dollars.  Prior to 1990,\n\nits Massachusetts subsidiary had  done some recruiting of New\n\nHampshire  doctors  to  act  as primary  care  providers  for\n\nborder-area residents  served by  its Massachusetts HMO.   In\n\n1989, U.S. Healthcare had a substantial interest in expanding\n\ninto New Hampshire.  \n\n     Dr.  Payson  was aware  in the  fall  of 1989  that HMOs\n\noperating in other states  were thinking about offering their\n\nservices  in New Hampshire.  He was also concerned that, when\n\nHealthsource  went public,  many  of its  doctor-shareholders\n\nwould  sell   their  stock,  decreasing  their   interest  in\n\nHealthsource and their incentive to control its costs.  After\n\nconsidering alternative incentives, Dr. Payson  and the HMO's\n\nchief operating officer conceived the exclusivity clause that\n\nhas prompted this litigation.  Shortly after the Healthsource\n\npublic offering in  November 1989, Healthsource  notified its\n\npanel doctors that they would receive greater compensation if\n\nthey agreed not to serve any other HMO.\n\n     The  new  contract  term, effective  January  26,  1990,\n\nprovided for  an increase in the  standard monthly capitation\n\npaid to  each primary  care physician, for  each Healthsource\n\nHMO patient cared for by that doctor, if the doctor agreed to\n\n                             -5-\n\nthe  following  optional  paragraph  in   the  basic  doctor-\n                        \n\nHealthsource agreement:\n\n     11.01 Exclusive Services  of Physicians.  Physician\n                                            \n     agrees  during the  term of  this Agreement  not to\n     serve  as a  participating physician for  any other\n     HMO  plan;   this  shall  not,   however,  preclude\n     Physician  from   providing  professional  courtesy\n     coverage arrangements for brief periods of  time or\n     emergency services to members of other HMO plans.\n\nA doctor who adopted  the option remained free to  serve non-\n\nHMO patients  under  ordinary indemnity  insurance  policies,\n\nunder  Blue  Cross\\Blue  Shield  plans,  or  under  preferred\n\nprovider  arrangements.   A  doctor who  accepted the  option\n\ncould also return to  non-exclusive status by giving notice.1\n\n     Although  Healthsource  capitation  amounts   varied,  a\n\ndoctor   who  accepted   the  exclusivity   option  generally\n\nincreased his  or her capitation  payments by  a little  more\n\nthan $1 per patient  per month; the magistrate judge  put the\n\namount at  $1.16  and said  that  it represented  an  average\n\nincrease of  about 14 percent as  compared with non-exclusive\n\nstatus.  The dollar benefit of  exclusivity for an individual\n\ndoctor  obviously  varies with  the  number  of HMO  patients\n\nhandled by the doctor.  Many of the doctors had less than 100\n\nHealthsource patients while about 50 of them had 200 or more.\n\n                    \n\n     1The  original notice  period was  180 days.   This  was\nreduced to  30 days in March  or April 1991.   It appears, at\nleast  in  practice,  that  a  doctor  could  switch to  non-\nexclusive  status more rapidly by returning some of the extra\ncompensation previously paid.\n\n                             -6-\n\nAbout 250  doctors, or  87 percent of  Healthsource's primary\n\ncare physicians, opted for exclusivity.\n\n     U.S.  Healthcare through  its  New Hampshire  subsidiary\n\napplied  for a New Hampshire  state license in  the spring of\n\n1990, following an earlier  application by its  Massachusetts\n\nsubsidiary.  A cease and desist order was entered against it,\n\nlimiting its  marketing efforts, because of  premature claims\n\nthat it  had approval to operate in the state.  The cease and\n\ndesist order  was withdrawn  on February  15,  1991, and  the\n\nlicense  issued  on  February  21,  1991,  subject  to  later\n\napproval  of marketing materials.  The present suit was filed\n\nin district court by U.S. Healthcare against Healthsource and\n\nDr. Payson on March  12, 1991.  By mid-1991,  U.S. Healthcare\n\nhad  only two  New  Hampshire \"accounts\"  and  only about  18\n\nprimary care physicians.\n\n     In  the district court,  U.S. Healthcare  challenged the\n\nexclusivity clause under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act,\n\n15 U.S.C.     1-2, and  under state antitrust  and tort  law.\n\nThe parties  stipulated to  trial before a  magistrate judge.\n\nAfter discovery,  two separate weeks of  trial were conducted\n\nin August and September 1991.  In a decision filed on January\n\n30, 1992, the  magistrate judge found  for the defendants  on\n\nall counts.  This appeal followed.\n\n                        II.

Were the law otherwise, every distributor or retailer\n\nwho  agreed with a manufacturer  to handle only  one brand of\n\ntelevision  or bicycle would be engaged in a group boycott of\n\nother manufacturers.\n\n     There are multiple reasons why the law permits (or, more\n\naccurately, does not condemn per se) vertical exclusivity; it\n\n                             -10-\n\nis enough to say here that the incentives for  and effects of\n\nsuch arrangements  are usually more benign  than a horizontal\n\narrangement among competitors that none of them will supply a\n\ncompany that deals  with one  of their competitors.   No  one\n\nwould think twice about  a doctor agreeing to work  full time\n\nfor a  staff HMO, an  extreme case  of vertical  exclusivity.\n\nImagine, by contrast, the motives and effects of a horizontal\n\nagreement by  all of the doctors  in a town not to  work at a\n\nhospital that  serves a  staff HMO  which  competes with  the\n\ndoctors.   \n\n     In this case, the exclusivity arrangements challenged by\n\nU.S. Healthcare are vertical in  form, that is, they comprise\n\nindividual  promises  to  Healthsource made  by  each  doctor\n\nselecting  the option  not to  offer his  or her  services to\n\nanother HMO.    The closest  that U.S. Healthcare  gets to  a\n\npossible  horizontal  case  is  this: it  suggests  that  the\n\nexclusivity clause in question, although vertical in form, is\n\nin substance an implicit  horizontal agreement by the doctors\n\ninvolved.  U.S. Healthcare appears to argue that stockholder-\n\ndoctors dominate Healthsource and,  in order to protect their\n\nindividual interests (as  stockholders in Healthsource), they\n\nagreed  (in their capacity as  doctors) not to  deal with any\n\nother HMO  that might  compete with  Healthsource.   We agree\n\nthat  such  a  horizontal  arrangement, if  devoid  of  joint\n\nventure efficiencies, might warrant per se condemnation.  \n\n                             -11-\n\n     The  difficulty is that there  is no evidence  of such a\n\nhorizontal agreement in this  case.  Although U.S. Healthcare\n\nnotes   that   doctor-stockholders    predominate   on    the\n\nHealthsource board that adopted  the option, there is nothing\n\nto  show that  the clause  was devised  or encouraged  by the\n\npanel doctors.   On the  contrary, the record  indicates that\n\nDr.  Payson  and   Healthsource's  chief  operating   officer\n\ndeveloped the option  to serve Healthsource's own  interests.\n\nFormally  vertical arrangements  used to  disguise horizontal\n\nones are not unknown, see Interstate  Circuit, Inc. v.

See Standard Stations, 337\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 307.  But there is one common danger for competition:\n\nan  exclusive  arrangement may  \"foreclose\"  so  much of  the\n\navailable supply or outlet capacity that existing competitors\n\nor new entrants may be limited or excluded and, under certain\n\ncircumstances,  this may  reinforce  market  power and  raise\n\nprices for consumers.  \n\n     Although   the   Supreme   Court   once  said   that   a\n\n\"substantial\"  percentage foreclosure of suppliers or outlets\n\nwould violate section 1, Standard Stations, the Court's Tampa\n                                                             \n\ndecision effectively replaced  any such quantitative  test by\n\nan  open-ended  inquiry into  competitive  impact.

Tampa is not even cited\n                                           \n\nin the opening or reply briefs.

In the\n\ntwo paragraphs  of its \"quick look\"  formulation addressed to\n\n\"anticompetitive impact,\" U.S. Healthcare simply asserts that\n\ncompetitive impact  has already  been discussed and  that the\n\nexclusivity clause has  completely foreclosed U.S. Healthcare\n\nand any other non-staff HMO from operation in New Hampshire.\n\n     This  is not a persuasive treatment of a difficult issue\n\nor, rather, a host of issues.  First, the extent to which the\n\nclause operated economically to restrict doctors is a serious\n\nquestion.3   True,  most doctors  signed up  for it;  but who\n\n                    \n\n     3Even with no notice period, Healthsource's differential\npricing policy--paying  more to those  who exclusively  serve\nHealthsource--would disadvantage competing HMOs.  Some courts\n\n                             -15-\n\nwould not take the extra compensation  when no competing non-\n\nstaff HMO was  yet operating?   The extent  of the  financial\n\nincentive to remain in an  exclusive status is unclear, since\n\nit varies with patient  load, and the least loaded  (and thus\n\nleast constrained  by the  clause) doctors would  normally be\n\nthe  best  candidates  for  a competing  HMO.    Healthsource\n\nsuggests that  by relatively modest amounts,  U.S. Healthcare\n\ncould offset  the exclusivity bonus for  a substantial number\n\nof  Healthsource  doctors.    U.S.  Healthcare's reply  brief\n\noffers no response.  \n\n     Second, along with the  economic inducement is the issue\n\nof duration.  Normally an exclusivity clause terminable on 30\n\ndays' notice would be close to a de minimus constraint (Tampa\n                                                             \n\ninvolved a 20-year contract, and  one year is sometimes taken\n\nas the trigger  for close scrutiny).   On the other  hand, it\n\nmay be that  the original 180-day  clause did frustrate  U.S.\n\nHealthcare's initial efforts to enlist panel doctors, without\n\nwhom it would  be hard to sign up employers.   Perhaps even a\n\n30-day  clause  would  have  this  effect,  especially  if  a\n\nreimbursement penalty were visited  on doctors switching back\n\nto non-exclusive status.  Once again, U.S. Healthcare's brief\n\noffers conclusions  and a few record  references, but neither\n\n                    \n\nhesitate to apply the  exclusivity label to such arrangements\nbecause  there  is no  continuing  promise not  to  deal (see\nAntitrust Developments, supra, at  176), but the differential\n                             \npricing  plan is  unquestionably part  of  a contract  and so\nsubject to section 1, whatever label may be applied.\n\n                             -16-\n\nthe  precise  operation  of the  clause  nor  its effects  on\n\nindividual doctors are clearly settled.\n\n     Third, even  assuming that the  financial incentive  and\n\nduration  of the  exclusivity clause did  remove many  of the\n\nHealthsource  doctors  from the  reach  of  new HMOs,  it  is\n\nunclear how much this foreclosure impairs the ability  of new\n\nHMOs to  operate.    Certainly the  number  of  primary  care\n\nphysicians  tied to Healthsource  was significant--one figure\n\nsuggested  is 25  percent or  more of  all such  primary care\n\nphysicians  in New  Hampshire--but this  still leaves  a much\n\nlarger number not  tied to Healthsource.  It may  be, as U.S.\n\nHealthcare  urges,  that  many of  the  remaining \"available\"\n\ndoctors cannot  fairly be counted (e.g.,  those employed full\n                                       \n\ntime elsewhere, or reaching retirement, or unwilling to serve\n\nHMOs at all).   But  the dimensions of  this limitation  were\n\ndisputed  and, by the same  token, new doctors are constantly\n\nentering the market with an immediate need for patients.\n\n     U.S. Healthcare lays great stress upon claims, supported\n\nby some meeting notes of Healthsource staff members, that the\n\nlatter was aware of new HMO entry and conscious that new HMOs\n\nlike  U.S.  Healthcare could  be  adversely  affected by  the\n\nexclusivity clause.4   Healthsource  in turn says  that these\n\n                    \n\n     4Two examples  of these  staff notes give  their flavor:\n\"Looking at '90 rates - and a deterent [sic] to joining other\nHMOs (like Healthcare)\"; and \"amend contract (sending this or\nnext  week) based on  exclusivity.

Motive can, of course,\n\nbe a guide  to expected  effects, but effects  are still  the\n\ncentral concern of the antitrust laws, and motive is mainly a\n\nclue,  see Barry Wright Corp. v.

This  case  itself suggests  how far\n\nmotives in business arrangement  may be mixed, ambiguous, and\n\nsubject to dispute.   In any event, under Tampa  the ultimate\n                                               \n\nissue in  exclusivity cases remains the  issue of foreclosure\n\nand its consequences.\n\n     Absent   a   compelling   showing  of   foreclosure   of\n\nsubstantial dimensions, we think  there is no need for  us to\n\npursue any  inquiry into  Healthsource's precise  motives for\n\nthe clause, the existence and measure of any claimed benefits\n\nfrom exclusivity, the balance  between harms and benefits, or\n\nthe possible existence and  relevance of any less restrictive\n\nmeans of achieving the benefits.  We are similarly spared the\n\ndifficulty of assessing the  fact that the clause  is limited\n\nto  HMOs, a fact  from which more  than one  inference may be\n\ndrawn.   The point is  that proof of  substantial foreclosure\n\nand  of  \"probable  immediate  and  future  effects\"  is  the\n\nessential basis under  Tampa for an attack  on an exclusivity\n                            \n\nclause.  U.S. Healthcare has not supplied that basis.\n\n                    \n\nalready . . . .\"\n\n                             -18-\n\n     In formal terms U.S.  Healthcare has preserved on appeal\n\nits claim that the exclusivity clause  unreasonably restrains\n\ncompetition  in violation  of  section 1.    That concept  is\n\nembraced  by  its complaint,  and  the  limited depiction  of\n\nevidence  in its  appellate  briefs stirs  curiosity, if  not\n\nsuspicion.  But  putting to one  side its  per se claims  and\n\nalleged  market  definition errors,  U.S.  Healthcare's basic\n\nargument  in this court  must be that  the evidence compelled\n                                                             \n\nthe  magistrate judge to  find substantial foreclosure having\n\nan  unreasonable   adverse  effect  on   competition.    U.S.\n\nHealthcare,  as  plaintiff at  trial  and  appellant in  this\n\ncourt,  had  the burden  of  fully  mustering the  facts  and\n\napplying the  analysis to establish such a claim.  It has not\n\ndone so.\n\n     In this  discussion, we  have placed little  weight upon\n\nthe  formal  finding  of   the  magistrate  judge  that  \"the\n\n[exclusivity] restriction does not constitute an unreasonable\n\nrestraint of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\"   His\n\nfinding  rested primarily  on the  premise that  whatever the\n\nimpact  of the clause on HMOs, ample competition remains in a\n\nproperly defined market,  which he found to  be one embracing\n\nall  health   care  offered  throughout  the   state  of  New\n\nHampshire.5  On this view of the antitrust laws,  it does not\n\n                    \n\n     5On  the other hand, we do  not accept U.S. Healthcare's\neffort  to salvage something from the decision by arguing the\nmagistrate judge found substantial  foreclosure in fact.

U.S. Healthcare argues, however,\n\nthat the market was misdefined.\n\n     It may be  unnecessary to consider this claim  since, as\n\nwe  have already held, U.S.  Healthcare has failed  to show a\n\nsubstantial foreclosure effect  from the exclusivity  clause.\n\nAfter all, an act can be wrongful in the context of section 2\n\nonly  where  it  has  or  threatens  to  have  a  significant\n\nexclusionary  impact.

This adaption is\n\nlegitimate (economists have no patent on the concept), but it\n\nmeans that normative and descriptive ideas become intertwined\n\nin the process of market definition.\n\n     Nevertheless,   rational   treatment   is  assisted   by\n\nremembering  to ask, in defining the market, why we are doing\n                                                \n\nso: that is, what is the antitrust question in this case that\n\nmarket  definition aims  to answer?   This  threshold inquiry\n\nhelps  resolve U.S.  Healthcare's claim  that  the magistrate\n\njudge  erred at the outset  by directing his  analysis to the\n\nissue whether HMOs or health  care financing was the relevant\n\nproduct  market.    This  approach,   says  U.S.  Healthcare,\n\nmistakenly  focuses on  the  sale of  health  care to  buyers\n                                 \n\nwhereas its  concern is Healthsource's buying  power in tying\n                                             \n\nup doctors needed by other HMOs in order to compete. \n\n                             -22-\n\n     The magistrate  judge's approach  was correct.   One can\n\nmonopolize a  product as either a seller or a buyer; but as a\n\nbuyer of doctor services,  Healthsource could never achieve a\n\nmonopoly (monopsony is  the technical term),  because doctors\n\nhave  too   many  alternative  buyers  for  their  services.7\n\nRather,  the only way to cast Healthsource as a monopolist is\n\nto  argue,  as  U.S.  Healthcare  apparently  did,  that  HMO\n\nservices  (or  even  IPA  HMOs) are  a  separate  health care\n\nproduct sold  to consumers  such as employers  and employees.\n            \n\nIf so, it  might become possible  (depending on market  share\n\nand other  factors) to describe Healthsource  as a monopolist\n\nor  potential  monopolist in  the sale  of  HMO (or  IPA HMO)\n\nservices in  New Hampshire, using the  exclusionary clause to\n\nfoster or reinforce the monopoly.\n\n     Thus,  the  magistrate judge  asked the  right question.\n\nEven  so U.S. Healthcare argues that he gave the wrong answer\n\nin finding that HMOs were not a  separate market (it uses the\n\nphrase  \"submarket\" but this does not alter the issue).  This\n\nis a legitimate contention  and U.S. Healthcare has  at least\n\n                    \n\n     7U.S.  Healthcare,  of  course, is  not  concerned  with\nHealthsource's ability  as a monopsonist  to exploit doctors;\nit is concerned with its own ability to find doctors to serve\nit. The latter  question--one of foreclosure--depends  on the\navailable supply  of doctors,  the constraint imposed  by the\nexclusivity  clause, the  prospect for  entry of  new doctors\ninto the market, and similar issues.  Whether U.S. Healthcare\nis foreclosed, however, does  not depend on whether consumers\ntreat HMOs  as a part of health care financing or as a unique\nand separate product.\n\n                             -23-\n\nsome basis  for it:   HMOs are often cheaper  than other care\n\nmethods because they emphasize illness prevention  and severe\n\ncost  control.   U.S.  Healthcare also  seeks to  distinguish\n\ncases defining  a broader  \"health  care financing  market\"--\n\ncases heavily relied on by the magistrate judge--as involving\n\nquite  different types of antitrust claims.   See, e.g., Ball\n                                                             \n\nMemorial Hosp.,  Inc. v.  Mutual Hosp.

Once again,  we agree that the nature\n\nof the claim can affect the proper market definition.\n\n     The  problem with  U.S.  Healthcare's argument  is  that\n\ndifferences in  cost and quality between  products create the\n\npossibility of  separate markets, not  the certainty.   A car\n\nwith  more features and a higher price is, within some range,\n\nin the  same market  as one  with less  features and  a lower\n\nprice.     The  issue  is  sometimes   described  as  one  of\n\ninterchangeability   of  products  or  services,  see  duPont\n                                                             \n\n(discussing  cross-elasticity  of   demand),  although   this\n\nformula is itself only an aid in trying to infer the shape of\n\nthe invisible demand curve facing the accused monopolist.  In\n\npractice, the frustrating but  routine question how to define\n\nthe product market  is answered in antitrust  cases by asking\n\nexpert  economists  to  testify.    Here,  the  issue  for an\n\neconomist would  be whether a  sole supplier of  HMO services\n\n(or IPA  HMOs if that  is U.S. Healthcare's  proposed market)\n\ncould raise price far enough over cost, and for a long enough\n\n                             -24-\n\nperiod, to enjoy monopoly  profits.  Usage patterns, customer\n\nsurveys,  actual profit levels,  comparison of features, ease\n\nof entry, and many other facts are pertinent in answering the\n\nquestion.\n\n     Once again,  U.S. Healthcare  has not  made its  case in\n\nthis court.  The (unquantified) cost advantage of HMOs is the\n\nonly important fact supplied;  consumers might, or might not,\n\nregard this benefit as just about offset by the limits placed\n\non  the patient's choice  of doctors.  To  be sure, there was\n\nsome  expert testimony in the district court on both sides of\n\nthe market  definition issue.   But if  there is any  case in\n\nwhich counsel has the obligation to cull the record, organize\n\nthe  facts, and present them in the framework of a persuasive\n\nlegal  argument, it  is a  sophisticated antitrust  case like\n\nthis one.  Without such a showing on appeal, we  have limited\n\nability  to reconstruct so complex  a record ourselves and no\n\nbasis for overturning the magistrate judge.\n\n     Absent the showing of  a properly defined product market\n\nin which  Healthsource could approach monopoly  size, we have\n\nno reason to consider the geographic dimension of the market.\n\nIf  health  care financing  is  the  product market,  as  the\n\nmagistrate  judge determined,  plainly  Healthsource  has  no\n\nmonopoly or anything close  to it, given the number  of other\n\nproviders  in New  Hampshire, such  as insurers,  staff HMOs,\n\nBlue  Cross/Blue  Shield and  individual  doctors.   This  is\n\n                             -25-\n\nequally  so whether  the  geographic market  is southern  New\n\nHampshire  (as U.S. Healthcare claims) or the whole state (as\n\nthe magistrate judge found).\n\n                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n     Once  the federal  antitrust claims  are  found wanting,\n\nthis appeal is resolved.  U.S. Healthcare offers no authority\n\nto  suggest that  New Hampshire  antitrust law  diverges from\n\nfederal law;  indeed, the state statute  encourages a uniform\n\nconstruction.   N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.    356:14.   As for the\n\nstate  tort-law claims, primarily interference with potential\n\ncontractual   relationships,   the  magistrate   judge  dealt\n\neffectively  with them,  and U.S.  Healthcare says  little on\n\nappeal  to undercut his dismissal of those counts.  Given the\n\narguments made and the record evidence arrayed in this court,\n\naffirmance of  the magistrate judge's judgment  on all counts\n\nis clearly in order.\n\n     Nevertheless,  we  do  not  think  that  this  case  was\n\ninherently frivolous.  The  timing and original 180-day reach\n\nof the  exclusivity clause could reasonably excite suspicion;\n\nthe clause may  have some  impact though the  extent of  that\n\nimpact remains  unclear; and  the motives of  Healthsource in\n\nadopting the clause  may well have  been mixed.   Competition\n\nremains an essential force in controlling costs and improving\n\nquality  in health  care.  Courts are  properly available  to\n\nsettle  claims  that  one   business  device  or  another  is\n\n                             -26-\n\nunlawfully  suppressing competition  in this  vital industry.\n\nAlthough  U.S. Healthcare's per se shortcut has taken it to a\n\ndead  end, we  have addressed  the antitrust  issues at  such\n\nlength precisely because of the importance of the subject.\n\n     Affirmed.  \n             \n\n                             -27-\n</pre>",
