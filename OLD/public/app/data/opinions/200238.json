This case addresses the rules that\n\nshould be applied in determining when a fiduciary of a trust is in\n\n\"defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,\" and so may not\n\nbe discharged from those debts in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 523(a)(4) (2000).    The issue is one of first impression for this\n\ncourt.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          We describe the facts as they are set forth in the\n\ndecision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), as\n\nsupplemented by the state probate court findings, in the underlying\n\nstate litigation which gives rise to the judgment debt against Carl\n\nBaylis, the bankrupt debtor.\n\n          In 1969, Antonia Quevillon, the settlor of the Antonia\n\nQuevillon Trust, consulted Baylis, an attorney, regarding the\n\ndisposition of the apartment buildings she owned and operated.    At\n\nthat time, she was seventy years old and in poor health. She had no\n\nprior relationship with Baylis.        Baylis drafted the trust into\n\nwhich she transferred her property.        The property consisted of\n\neight apartment buildings in Massachusetts: six in Southbridge and\n\ntwo in Worcester.     Baylis also drafted an exculpatory clause into\n\nthe trust which stated that \"[e]ach trustee shall be liable only\n\nfor his own willful misconduct or omissions in bad faith.\"\n\n          Quevillon died on May 10, 1971.       After her death, the\n\ntrust was to provide income to her children for a period of twenty\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fyears at which point it would terminate, and the trust property was\n\nto be divided equally among the children of Marcel Quevillon, a son\n\nof the settlor.   (It did so terminate on May 10, 1991.)\n\n          Baylis and Estelle Ballard, daughter of the settlor and\n\none of the income beneficiaries, were appointed co-trustees; they\n\nserved from May 1971 to May 1991.      Ballard agreed to manage the\n\nproperty for $50 per week, and was paid from December 1973 through\n\nMay 1991, for a total of $45,100.    Not only did Ballard derive her\n\nincome from managing the buildings, but she also lived in one unit,\n\nand the trust paid her utilities and provided items such as cable\n\ntelevision and a washing machine.       Baylis did not discuss any\n\nmanagement fees with the settlor.    By his own admission, he almost\n\nentirely abdicated his responsibilities as trustee to Ballard, who\n\nalone actively managed the property.\n\n          The property appreciated substantially in value from\n\n$256,000 in 1971 to $1.3 million in 1986, but paid the income\n\nbeneficiaries only $48,813 between 1971 and 1985. The trustees had\n\ndiscretion to sell the trust property, and the trust did pay taxes\n\nand other expenses from the estate out of income derived from\n\nprofits and the sale of a building in 1971.   The trust sold another\n\nbuilding in 1984.\n\n          The income beneficiaries were taxed on the capital gains\n\nbut did not receive any actual distribution of money.      Concerned,\n\nthe income beneficiaries met in 1985 with the co-trustees to\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fdiscuss the lack of income from the trust property.              The trustees\n\nacknowledged    that    each   of   the   income   beneficiaries    was     owed\n\n$82,000.      This represented the amount, with interest, of the\n\ndifference between the actual distributions received and the amount\n\non which each of the beneficiaries had been taxed since May 10,\n\n1971.   Baylis told the beneficiaries that the trust was broke.               At\n\nthat meeting, it was decided that the property would be sold and\n\nthe proceeds invested in government bonds.          Ballard did not object\n\nto selling the properties.\n\n             In late 1985, the trustees began accepting offers on the\n\nremaining six buildings.        By January 1986, they had received an\n\noffer   of   $215,000   from    Mr.   and   Mrs.   Young   for   two   of    the\n\nSouthbridge properties. The Ramshorn Realty Trust, in the business\n\nof purchasing and selling apartment buildings since 1986, made\n\nanother offer, subject to the availability of financing, of $1.425\n\nmillion for the other four properties.         Ramshorn had recently sold\n\nsubstantial assets and had cash on hand to make a down payment.\n\nBoth purchasers paid deposits of $1,000.           The six properties were\n\nlater appraised for only $1.3 million, significantly below the\n\noffers received of $1.64 million.\n\n             Ballard, however, desired to own the properties herself.\n\nShe also intended that the properties not be sold out of the\n\nfamily.      Baylis, knowing this, presented the offers to her by\n\nletter dated February 5, 1986 and gave her an opportunity to match\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthem, but it was soon evident that she could not finance the\n\npurchase.      Baylis tried to cajole her into agreeing to sell to the\n\nofferors.       She   then    refused    to    sell      the   property   and   later\n\ntestified that she had not considered the interests of either the\n\nincome beneficiaries or the remaindermen in making that decision.\n\n            Even though Ballard had refused to sell the property,\n\nBaylis forwarded purchase and sale agreements to the prospective\n\nbuyers on May 20, 1986.         The buyers signed the agreements by June\n\n3, 1986 and put down additional deposits.                Baylis hoped to close on\n\nDecember 31, 1986, thinking that date would be advantageous for\n\ncapital gains treatment.              Baylis signed the agreement; Ballard\n\nrefused   to    sign.        Baylis    did    not   go    to   probate    court   for\n\ninstructions.\n\n            Baylis instead responded to Ballard on July 22, 1986 by\n\nproposing that Ballard would receive the two properties for which\n\n$215,000 had been offered, and would allow the other sale, to\n\nRamshorn, to proceed.         He did this although the Youngs had signed\n\na   Purchase    and   Sale    Agreement      that   he    himself   had    prepared.\n\nBallard agreed to this proposal, subject to conditions. Baylis did\n\nnot inform the Youngs of this development.                 He had appraisals done\n\nin anticipation of a license to sell the properties.                      The Youngs\n\nlearned of this proposed sale to Ballard and sued the trust, the\n\ntrustees, and Baylis in his individual capacity.                         The lawsuit\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fsought specific performance of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and\n\nit alleged that Baylis had committed fraud.\n\n          The trustees were served with the suit on December 13,\n\n1986; after being served, Ballard then decided that she would not\n\nsell at all.   As she put it, a sale would have left her \"out in the\n\ncold with nothing.\"   The trust settled the case with the Youngs and\n\npaid the legal expenses associated with the suit. The Youngs' case\n\ncontinued against Baylis individually for fraud.     The trust paid\n\n$7,000 for defense of the case against Baylis and $15,000 to settle\n\nit.\n\n          Baylis had prepared and filed a petition in Probate and\n\nFamily Court for a license to sell the property in December 1986.\n\nThe SJC later found, however, that Baylis did not disclose to the\n\ncourt Ballard's refusal to consent to the sale:\n\n          Baylis's complaint, however, did not challenge Ballard's\n          refusal at all. Instead the complaint he presented to\n          the court stated that Ballard had submitted her\n          resignation to Baylis and that he had accepted it. The\n          judge, not knowing that Ballard was wrongfully refusing\n          to consent, deferred judgment subject to obtaining\n          Ballard's signature.     Baylis never followed up by\n          informing Ballard that she might be in breach of her\n          fiduciary duty by not signing nor did he ask the judge to\n          compel Ballard to agree to the sale. Because Baylis did\n          not file a petition explaining to the judge that the sale\n          would be in the best interests of the beneficiaries and\n          that Ballard was improperly blocking the sale, he did not\n          take the steps reasonably necessary to prevent Ballard\n          from breaching her duty.\n\nRutanen v. Ballard, 678 N.E.2d 133, 140 (Mass. 1997).\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f               The income beneficiaries filed suit in probate court\n\nagainst the trustees on May 23, 1988.             The trust terminated on May\n\n10, 1991, and the property was transferred to the remaindermen, who\n\nintervened in the suit.            At that time, the estimated value of the\n\nproperty was $1.081 million.              The probate court found that the\n\nYoungs and Ramshorn were ready, willing and able to purchase the\n\ntrust properties, and Ballard and Baylis breached their fiduciary\n\nduties by failing to sell the properties in 1986.                  It also found\n\nthat       Baylis   \"knowingly     allow[ed]    Ms.     Ballard   to   breach   her\n\nfiduciary duties without taking any action.\"\n\n               Baylis claimed that the exculpatory clause he had drafted\n\nprotected him.         The probate court found that these breaches of\n\nfiduciary       duty   were   in    bad   faith   and    therefore     beyond   the\n\nprotection of the clause, and that even if the breaches were not in\n\nbad faith, the exculpatory clause was not enforceable because\n\nBaylis, a co-trustee, drafted the language, and the settlor was of\n\nill health and had not been advised to seek the advice of outside\n\ncounsel.\n\n               The probate court awarded judgments of $330,079.95 to the\n\nbeneficiaries and $607,900.27 to the remaindermen on findings that\n\nthe co-trustees had violated their fiduciary duties.1                  The damages\n\n\n       1\n       The probate court judgment in favor of the income\nbeneficiaries included damages of $244,493.75 for failure to\nsell, $27,322.90 for trust expenditures in the defense and\nsettlement of the Young suit and $58,263.30 in pre-judgment\ninterest. The judgment in favor of the remaindermen comprised\n\n                                          -8-\n\fincluded both the net proceeds from the sales and the profits\n\nresulting from the planned investment in six-month Treasury bills.\n\nRutanen v. Ballard, No. 88E0072-G1, slip op. at 22-23 (Prob. Ct.\n\nMass. Apr. 15, 1993); Rutanen v. Ballard, No. 88E0072-G1, slip op.\n\nat 1-2 (Prob. Ct. Mass. Nov. 4, 1993) (supplemental judgment).\n\n           On     appeal,    the    Massachusetts     Supreme   Judicial    Court\n\naffirmed the probate court's decision, but solely on the ground\n\nthat   Baylis     acted    negligently    and   was    not   shielded   by    the\n\nexculpatory clause.         Rutanen, 678 N.E.2d at 136, 140.          As to the\n\nprobate court's finding of bad faith, the SJC found that \"the\n\nevidence is more questionable\" and declined to rely on it in\n\naffirming the decision.         Id. at 140.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           Faced with the judgments against him, Baylis filed for\n\nbankruptcy.     The trust's income beneficiaries, as creditors, took\n\nthe    position    that     their    judgment   against      Baylis   was    non-\n\ndischargeable because the debt resulted from Baylis's \"defalcation\n\nwhile acting in a fiduciary capacity\" under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4).\n\nIn addition, they asserted the debts resulted from \"willful and\n\nmalicious injury by the debtor . . . to the property of another.\"\n\nId. § 523(a)(6).          The parties stipulated that the state probate\n\ncourt's findings of fact were binding, except for the finding that\n\nBaylis acted in bad faith.\n\n\n$544,767 in damages and $63,133.27 in pre-judgment interest.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f           Both sides moved for summary judgment.                 Although styled\n\nas summary judgment, it is evident they expected the court to\n\nresolve the case on the stipulated record.                The bankruptcy court\n\nheld that the probate court's finding that Baylis had acted in bad\n\nfaith had no preclusive effect because it was not essential to the\n\njudgment and had not been ruled on by the Supreme Judicial Court.\n\nRutanen v. Baylis, 222 B.R. 1, 7 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1998).                 It also\n\nfound Baylis's conduct did not amount to defalcation.                  Id. at 5.\n\nThe district court disagreed, holding that Baylis was bound by the\n\nprobate court's bad faith finding, and as such had committed\n\ndefalcation.     Rutanen v. Baylis, No. 98-30174-NMG, slip op. at 12\n\n(D. Mass. Oct. 29, 1999).              This court found that the bad faith\n\nfinding did not have a preclusive effect because the SJC had\n\nrefused to affirm on that ground, and remanded the case to the\n\ndistrict court.     Rutanen v. Baylis (In re Baylis), 217 F.3d 66, 71\n\n(1st Cir. 2000). On remand, on cross-motions for summary judgment,\n\nthe   district    court       found    that   Baylis's   conduct     amounted    to\n\ndefalcation      under    §     523(a)(4),      and   that    §   523(a)(6)     was\n\ninapplicable.     Rutanen v. Baylis, 275 B.R. 145, 153-54 (D. Mass.\n\n2002).   Baylis appeals the § 523(a)(4) determination against him;\n\nthe plaintiffs cross-appeal the § 523(a)(6) finding.\n\n                                        III.\n\n           Because       this   case    was    decided   on   cross-motions     for\n\nsummary judgment, our review of the bankruptcy court decision is de\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fnovo. See Piccicuto v. Dwyer, 39 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 1994).         The\n\nstandard by which to measure \"defalcation\" of a fiduciary duty for\n\npurposes of § 523(a)(4) is a legal question, in any event, to which\n\nwe give de novo review.      The parties have agreed that they are\n\nbound by the probate court's findings of fact.\n\nA.        Meaning of Defalcation of a Fiduciary Duty, 11 U.S.C.\n          § 523(a)(4)\n\n          Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code contains a number of\n\nexceptions to discharge of debt.    Section 523(a) provides that:\n\n          (a) A discharge . . . does not discharge an individual\n          debtor from any debt . . .\n          (4) for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary\n          capacity, embezzlement, or larceny.\n\n(emphasis added).   This provision has been part of the Bankruptcy\n\nAct since 1867.     See An act to establish a uniform system of\n\nbankruptcy through the United States, ch. CLXXVI, § 33, 14 Stat.\n\n517, 533 (1867) (repealed 1878); cf. An act to establish a uniform\n\nsystem of bankruptcy throughout the United States, ch. IX, § 1, 5\n\nStat. 440, 441 (1841) (repealed 1843) (excepting only debts arising\n\nfrom \"defalcation as a public officer\").   An exception to discharge\n\nshould be strictly construed.    Gleason v. Thaw, 236 U.S. 558, 562\n\n(1915).   \"Exceptions   to   discharge   are   narrowly   construed    in\n\nfurtherance of the Bankruptcy Code's 'fresh start' policy . . . .\"\n\nCentury 21 Balfour Real Estate v. Menna (In re Menna), 16 F.3d 7,\n\n9 (1st Cir. 1994); see Grogan v. Garner, 498 U.S. 279, 286 (1991)\n\n(endorsing the \"fresh start\" policy).\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            Within this context, certain rules are clear about the\n\navailability of the exception:\n\n1) The burden of proof to establish defalcation is on the creditor,\n\ngiven the \"fresh start\" policy.          In re Menna, 16 F.3d at 9 (a\n\nclaimant must prove that his \"claim comes squarely within an\n\nexception   enumerated   in   Bankruptcy   Code   §   523(a)\");   see   also\n\nPalmacci v. Umpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 786 (1st Cir. 1997).2\n\n2) The creditor must show defalcation by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.   Grogan, 498 U.S. at 286-87.\n\n3) The exception to discharge applies to fiduciaries only while they\n\nare acting in a fiduciary capacity.3\n\n4) Inherent in \"defalcation\" is the requirement that there be a\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty; if there is no breach, there is no\n\ndefalcation.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       But see In re Niles, 106 F.3d 1456, 1462 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(shifting the burden to the debtor under the defalcation exception\nonce the creditor demonstrates that the debtor was a fiduciary).\n     3\n        Some years ago, the Supreme Court noted that under\n§ 523(a)(4), the exception for fiduciary capacity applies only to\nexpress trusts, and not to equitable trusts created by the debtor's\nconduct. Davis v. Aetna Acceptance Co., 293 U.S. 328, 333 (1934).\nWhether this continues to be so is in doubt. See, e.g., Republic\nof Rwanda v. Uwinama (In re Uwimana), 274 F.3d 806, 811 (4th Cir.\n2001) (ambassadors are fiduciaries for countries they represent).\nIt is undisputed that Baylis is a fiduciary for purposes of\n§ 523(a)(4) and so this case does not present the question of when\nelse a fiduciary capacity arises.\n\n                                  -12-\n\f5) In order to avoid redundancy, defalcation must mean something\n\nother than fraud and different from \"willful and malicious injury,\"\n\n11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6).\n\n6) Defalcation is to be measured objectively.                      Cent. Hanover Bank\n\n& Trust Co. v. Herbst, 93 F.2d 510, 512 (2d Cir. 1937).\n\n                 That then leaves the question of the standard to measure\n\nwhen       a   fiduciary        breach   is   a   \"defalcation.\"        The    dictionary\n\ndefinitions of defalcation are of limited assistance.                         Black's Law\n\nDictionary (7th ed. 1999) defines defalcation as, \"Loosely, the\n\nfailure to meet an obligation; a nonfraudulent default.\"                          Id. at\n\n427.           The     Oxford    English      Dictionary   (2d    ed.    1989)    defines\n\ndefalcation as, \"A monetary deficiency through breach of trust by\n\none who has the                management or charge of funds; a fraudulent\n\ndeficiency in money matters.\"                 4 id. at 369.      The Oxford Dictionary\n\nof English Etymology (C.T. Onuns ed., 1966) tells us that the word\n\nderives from the \"earlier defalk which survives in U.S. legal use.\n\nSee    -       ation    [is]     diminution,      reduction,     curtailment.     .   .   ,\n\ndefective, failure; fraudulent monetary deficiency.\"                          Id. at 250.\n\nThe etymology of the word thus shows the term historically has\n\ncovered both fraudulent and non-fraudulent acts.4                       Our view is that\n\nnot every breach of a fiduciary duty amounts to defalcation.\n\n\n       4\n      By contrast, A Dictionary of Modern American Usage (B.\nGarner ed., 1998) says that it is only by slipshod extension\nthat \"some writers have misused defalcation when referring to\na non-fraudulent default,\" a view contrary to other authors of\nother dictionaries. Id. at 191.\n\n                                              -13-\n\f          The case law in this area is far from a seamless whole.\n\nMore than sixty years ago, Judge Learned Hand's carefully equivocal\n\nopinion in Herbst held that there could be defalcation even in the\n\nabsence of deliberate wrongdoing.       Recognizing the ambiguities in\n\nthe term, he noted:\n\n          All we decide is that when a fiduciary takes money upon\n          a conditional authority which may be revoked and knows at\n          the time that it may, he is guilty of a \"defalcation\"\n          though it may not be a \"fraud,\" or an \"embezzlement,\" or\n          perhaps not even a \"misappropriation.\"\n\nHerbst, 93 F.2d at 512.\n\n          Roughly, three interpretive camps have been established\n\nas to the standard for measuring defalcation.     The first is that an\n\ninnocent mistake can constitute defalcation. See Republic of Rwanda\n\nv. Uwinama (In re Uwimana), 274 F.3d 806, 811 (4th Cir. 2001) (self-\n\ndealing); Tudor Oaks Ltd. P'ship v. Cochrane (In re Cochrane), 124\n\nF.3d 978, 984 (8th Cir. 1997) (same); Lewis v. Scott (In re Lewis),\n\n97 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir. 1996) (failure to account fully for\n\nmoney received).   The second is that negligence by the fiduciary is\n\nrequired but no more.   See Antlers Roof-Truss & Builders Supply v.\n\nStorie (In re Storie), 216 B.R. 283, 288 (B.A.P. 10th Cir. 1997)\n\n(failure to account).     The third is that at least recklessness by\n\nthe fiduciary is required. See Schwager v. Fallas (In re Schwager),\n\n121 F.3d 177, 185 (5th Cir. 1997) (breach of duty to manage);\n\nMeyer v. Rigdon, 36 F.3d 1375, 1384-85 (7th Cir. 1994) (same);\n\nCarlisle Cashway, Inc. v. Johnson (In re Johnson), 691 F.2d 249, 257\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f(6th Cir. 1982) (failure to account); Herbst, 93 F.2d at 512 (for\n\na failure to account, defalcation must be \"due to a known breach of\n\nthe duty, and not to mere negligence or mistake\").        The different\n\ncamps not only exist between the different circuits, but sometimes\n\nwithin the bankruptcy courts of the same circuit, including this\n\none.   Compare M-R Sullivan Mfg. Co. v. Sullivan (In re Sullivan),\n\n238 B.R. 230, 237-38 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1999) (recklessness required,\n\nconsidering breach of duty to manage), with Hoff v. Carroll (In re\n\nCarroll), 140 B.R. 313, 316 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1992) (negligence or\n\nignorance enough for failure to account).       The types of duty which\n\nthe fiduciary has violated appear to influence the choice of\n\nstandard regardless of the broad language sometimes used.\n\n          The present range of interpretations of \"defalcation\"\n\namong the circuits, from innocent mistake to a civil recklessness\n\nstandard, does not, in our view, adequately capture Congress's\n\nintended meaning of the term in § 523(a)(4).      Instead, we find that\n\na defalcation requires some degree of fault, closer to fraud,\n\nwithout   the   necessity   of   meeting   a   strict   specific   intent\n\nrequirement.    Our view is based on both the structure of 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 523(a) and the \"fresh start\" policy.\n\n          A reading of § 523 as a whole indicates that most of the\n\nexceptions to discharge in bankruptcy are in place for one of two\n\nbasic reasons.     First, bankruptcy may not be used to avoid the\n\npayment of certain types of debts, the repayment of which are\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fimportant for policy reasons.    Exceptions to discharge falling in\n\nthis category include debts for: taxes or customs duties, id.\n\n§ 523(a)(1), or debts incurred to pay tax, id. § 523(a)(14); alimony\n\nand child support payments, id. § 523(a)(5); fines, penalties or\n\nforfeitures to the government, id. § 523(a)(7); educational loans\n\nmade or insured by the government or a nonprofit institution, id.\n\n§ 523(a)(8); orders of restitution, id. § 523(a)(13); court fees,\n\nid. § 523(a)(17); and support owed under state law and enforceable\n\nunder the Social Security Act, id. § 523(a)(18). The level of fault\n\nof the debtor has no bearing on these exceptions; the exception\n\nturns on the type of debt.\n\n            It is arguable that defalcation by a fiduciary fits into\n\nthis \"type of debt\" category -- that is, that Congress intended to\n\nreinforce the high standard of care owed by fiduciaries by making\n\ndebts for defalcation non-dischargeable. That reading is, we think,\n\nan unlikely one, and we see no strong federal interest in making\n\nevery debt from breach of a fiduciary duty non-dischargeable.\n\n            The other large category of bankruptcy exceptions relies\n\non fault.   These exceptions define not the type of debt itself, but\n\nthe type of fault that caused the debt.     Such exceptions include\n\ndebts generated by: money, goods or services obtained by fraud or\n\nfalsehood, id. § 523(a)(2); willful and malicious injury, id.\n\n§ 523(a)(6); death or injury caused by driving under the influence\n\nof alcohol or drugs, id. § 523(a)(9); and the exception we interpret\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fhere, \"fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,\n\nembezzlement, or larceny,\" id. § 523(a)(4).\n\n          There is also one exception that spans both categories:\n\nthe exception \"for malicious or reckless failure\" to maintain\n\ncapital of an insured depository institution to the extent required\n\nby federal regulatory agencies.     Id. § 523(a)(12).       This exception\n\ncombines a level of fault with a type of debt important for reasons\n\nof federal financial policy.\n\n          As is evident from the above listings, those exceptions\n\nthat rely exclusively on a level of fault concern extremely serious\n\nactions done knowingly or with great risk of harm to others.               A\n\ncharge of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs requires\n\nknowing ingestion of those substances with at least the attributed\n\nknowledge of consequent great risk that others will be injured. The\n\nexception for willful and malicious injury we discuss below also\n\nrequires some form of intent.       Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U.S. 57,\n\n61-62 (1998).    Obtaining money, goods or services by criminal fraud\n\nor false pretenses also requires knowledge and more: a specific\n\nintent to defraud.     E.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2000) (mail fraud);\n\nUnited States v. Sawyer, 239 F.3d 31, 40 (1st Cir. 2001).          Specific\n\nintent requires that the accused have the intent to accomplish the\n\nprecise criminal act with which he is charged.            See Black's Law\n\nDictionary, supra, at 814.     The structure of 11 U.S.C. § 523 as a\n\nwhole,   then,   suggests   that   for    an   act   to   fall   under   the\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f\"defalcation\" exception to discharge, it must be a serious one\n\nindeed, and some fault must be involved.         The defalcation by a\n\nfiduciary, in our view, belongs in this category.\n\n          This interpretation is buttressed by the structure of\n\n§ 523(a)(4) itself.   First, the same line contains exceptions to\n\ndischarge for fraud and defalcation while acting as a fiduciary, and\n\nembezzlement and larceny generally.        Id. § 523(a)(4).        Fraud,\n\nembezzlement, and larceny are all serious crimes requiring specific\n\nintent. To the extent that the term covers civil actions for fraud,\n\nsuch as a fraudulent misrepresentation, the maker of the statement\n\nmust know or believe the statement is untrue or that he has no basis\n\nto make the statement.    See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 526\n\n(1976).   Moreover, it is telling that in § 523(a)(4) fraud and\n\ndefalcation are listed together.\n\n          Reading   \"defalcation\"   as   akin   to   the   other   actions\n\nconstituting fault-based exceptions to discharge is also consistent\n\nwith the \"fresh start\" policy undergirding the bankruptcy system.\n\nThe bankruptcy system is designed and used to obtain a fresh start\n\nfor those owing debts of many kinds, including civil damages awards.\n\nWere this not so, the narrow exceptions in § 523(a) would make\n\nlittle sense.\n\n          Of course, the term \"defalcation\" must mean something\n\ndifferent than the other terms listed.    \"In construing a statute we\n\nare obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fused.\"    Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979).                     We\n\nbelieve that defalcation lessens the threshold required from one of\n\ncriminal or civil fraud to something less.               To show defalcation, a\n\ncreditor need not prove that a debtor acted knowingly or willfully,\n\nin the sense of specific intent.               However, a creditor must be able\n\nto show that a debtor's actions were so egregious that they come\n\nclose    to   the    level   that      would    be   required   to   prove   fraud,\n\nembezzlement, or larceny.\n\n              A debtor fiduciary may not escape the exclusion from\n\ndischarge of his debt arising out of defalcation by saying he had\n\nno specific intent.          As in other areas of the law, circumstances\n\nwill    provide     the   level   of    wrongdoing     needed   to   constitute    a\n\ndefalcation.      One useful analogy is to the law of securities, which\n\nrequires \"scienter.\"         Scienter, in the context of securities fraud,\n\nis \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or\n\ndefraud.\"      Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12\n\n(1976).       A form of recklessness can meet the                requirement of\n\nscienter, but it is \"more like a lesser form of intent.\"                 Rizek v.\n\nSEC, 215 F.3d 157, 162 (1st Cir. 2000).               This form of recklessness\n\nis \"an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.\"\n\nGreebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 198 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(quoting Sundstrand Corp. v. Sun Chem. Corp., 553 F.2d 1033, 1045\n\n(7th Cir. 1977)). The mental state required for defalcation is akin\n\nto the level of recklessness required for scienter. It is more than\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fthe mere conscious taking of risk associated with the usual torts\n\nstandard of recklessness.        See Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at\n\n1276-77. Instead, defalcation requires something close to a showing\n\nof extreme recklessness.\n\n          In   evaluating    whether   there    is    a   defalcation    of    a\n\nfiduciary duty, there must be reference to the duty involved.                 Of\n\nthe various duties, the duty of loyalty is \"[t]he most fundamental\n\nduty owed . . . the duty of a trustee to administer the trust solely\n\nin the interest of the beneficiaries.\"          2A A. Scott, The Law of\n\nTrusts § 170 (W.F. Fratcher ed., 4th ed. 2001).\n\n          Defalcation may be presumed from breach of the duty of\n\nloyalty, the duty not to act in the fiduciary's own interest when\n\nthat   interest    comes    or   may   come    into   conflict    with    the\n\nbeneficiaries' interest:\n\n          A trustee occupies a position in which the courts have\n          fixed a very high and very strict standard for his\n          conduct whenever his personal interest comes or may come\n          into conflict with his duty to the beneficiaries.      As\n          long as he is not acting in his own interest the standard\n          fixed for his behavior is only that of a reasonable\n          degree of care, skill, and caution. But when the trustee\n          acts in his own interest in connection with the\n          performance of his duties as trustee, the standard of\n          behavior becomes more rigorous.      In such a case his\n          interest must yield to that of the beneficiaries.\n\n2A id. § 170.25.    As with the other fault-based exceptions, fault\n\nmay be presumed from the circumstances, here a violation of the duty\n\nof loyalty.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fB.          Application of Defalcation Standard to Facts\n\n            There is no dispute as to the material facts and we are\n\nassisted by the probate court findings.5\n\n            The bankruptcy court granted Baylis's summary judgment\n\nmotion because it found mere negligence in Baylis's actions:\n\n            The Debtor did not stand by and do nothing. And he did\n            more than merely ask Ballard to agree to the sales. He\n            put pressure on her in two ways, first by presenting her\n            with agreements signed by the buyers and later by filing\n            a petition in court to sell the properties. Although he\n            was adjudicated to have been negligent in not going\n            further and requesting a court order against her, he\n            surely was not in reckless disregard of his obligations\n            concerning Ballard's fiduciary defaults.\n\nRutanen, 222 B.R. at 5.        Ignoring the probate court's contrary\n\nfinding, the bankruptcy court found nothing improper in the Trust's\n\npayment of the expenses of the suit against Baylis for fraud.\n\n            The   district   court   overturned   the   grant   of   summary\n\njudgment to Baylis and entered summary judgment for the creditors.\n\nIt found that Baylis, by executing purchase and sale agreements even\n\nthough Ballard refused to agree to a sale, \"practically assured a\n\nlawsuit.\"   Rutanen, 275 B.R. at 152.       Baylis also used trust funds\n\nin a resulting lawsuit brought against him personally, not only to\n\npay attorneys' fees, but also to settle the lawsuit.            Id. at 153.\n\nFinally, the district court noted that \"Baylis is an attorney who\n\n\n\n     5\n       As a practical matter these cases will usually come up on\nappeal with the result determined by the findings of fact made by\nthe bankruptcy court. Those findings will be binding unless they\nare clearly erroneous.\n\n                                     -21-\n\fspecializes in the law of trusts and estates.                 He was well aware of\n\nthe duties required of a fiduciary under trust law.\"                     Id.\n\n            Both courts treated the question of the dischargeability\n\nof the debt as a unitary one.          We think it more helpful to consider\n\nthe different components of the judgment debt.                   The judgment debt\n\ncomprises three elements: $27,322.90 for the trust expenditures for\n\nBaylis's benefit on the Youngs' lawsuit against him; over $937,000\n\nfor the loss in value of the property due to the failure to sell;\n\nand the pre-judgment interest.\n\n            We start with the $27,322 payment for Baylis's benefit in\n\nthe lawsuit against him by the Youngs and the associated interest.\n\nOf   course,     not    all    payments   from    a     trust    to     trustees   are\n\ninappropriate.         Trustees may receive fees and be reimbursed for\n\nexpenses.        They may be defended and indemnified in lawsuits.\n\nNevertheless, the impropriety of those payments here was resolved\n\nby the state courts, and that is a binding ruling. See Rutanen, No.\n\n88E0072-G1, slip op. at 22 (Apr. 15, 1993). The probate court found\n\nthat although the trust had no obligation to defend Baylis on the\n\nfraud charges brought against him personally or to indemnify him,\n\nBaylis caused fees for his defense to be paid by the Trust.                        That\n\nwrongdoing was compounded by Baylis having the trust pay the $15,000\n\nit   took   to    settle      the   Youngs'    claims    of     fraud    against    him\n\npersonally.       Baylis is bound by the probate court's holding,\n\n\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\faffirmed by the SJC, that these payments were inappropriate.    See\n\nMontana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153 (1979).\n\n          Baylis's actions as to this component of the debt do\n\nconstitute defalcation.    Baylis's actions were in violation of his\n\nduty of loyalty.   He used trust monies to pay the attorney's fees\n\nand settle the lawsuit brought by the Youngs.     His breach of the\n\nduty of loyalty is exacerbated by the fact that Baylis, in breach\n\nof various fiduciary duties, brought about the conditions that led\n\nto the lawsuit.\n\n          Even after it was apparent to him that Ballard, his co-\n\ntrustee, had refused to assent to a sale of property to either the\n\nYoungs or to Ramshorn, Baylis forwarded purchase and sale agreements\n\nto both prospective buyers, who signed them and put down deposits.\n\nHe thus virtually guaranteed the ensuing litigation with the Youngs,\n\nwhich led to a wasting of the trust's assets in defending and\n\nsettling the litigation.\n\n          Given Baylis's active role in creating the conflict over\n\nwhich the Youngs were suing, he should have requested permission\n\nfrom the probate court before he used trust assets to defend himself\n\nagainst the personal aspects of the Youngs' lawsuit.   He did not do\n\nso.   Instead, he proceeded to use trust assets to defend himself,\n\nan extremely reckless thing to do in light of his duty of loyalty.\n\n          Given this combination of the fiduciary breach which\n\ncaused the lawsuit and the self-dealing to defend against it, we\n\n\n                                -23-\n\ffind that Baylis's actions here constitute defalcation under 11\n\nU.S.C. § 523(a)(4). Thus, the $27,322 of the judgment debt relating\n\nto these actions is non-dischargeable.\n\n           Whether the remaining damages attributed to the loss in\n\nvalue of the trust from the failure to sell the property resulted\n\nfrom defalcation presents a different question.             Baylis, as co-\n\ntrustee, was obliged to participate in the administration of the\n\ntrust and to use reasonable care to prevent a co-trustee from\n\ncommitting a breach of the trust.           Rutanen, 678 N.E. 2d at 140\n\n(citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 184 (1959)).             Co-trustees\n\nmay not acquiesce in the other trustee's refusal to exercise a power\n\nthe trustees are obligated to exercise. Id. Should that occur, the\n\nco-trustee must apply to the courts for instructions.\n\n           Baylis argues he acted reasonably in compliance with these\n\nobligations when he applied to the probate court in December 1986\n\nto conduct a sale, and so any breach cannot be a defalcation.\n\n\"Reasonableness,\" as we have said, is not the test for whether a\n\nbreach is a defalcation, but if the trustee has acted reasonably,\n\nthere is no defalcation.       For the prior 15 years, Baylis had let\n\nBallard    manage   the    trust   properties,    largely       ignoring    his\n\nobligations, yet during most of those 15 years it was not evident\n\nthat Ballard was in breach of her fiduciary obligations.                 Still,\n\nBallard's breach of her own duty of loyalty around the time of the\n\nproposed   sales    was   sufficiently    egregious   as   to   amount     to   a\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fdefalcation.      It is a different matter whether her co-trustee's\n\nfailure to bring her defalcation to the attention of the probate\n\ncourt was itself a defalcation.\n\n           We are troubled by the fact that when Baylis went to the\n\nprobate court for instructions to sell, he failed to disclose\n\nmaterial information to the court.             He did not describe the co-\n\ntrustee's conflict of interest, her breach of fiduciary duty, or the\n\nfacts   giving    rise   to   the   problem.     Nonetheless,   it   was   not\n\nunreasonable for Baylis to think that the matter would be resolved\n\nif the court gave instructions to sell the property.

Both courts concluded that Baylis's debt\n\nwould not be non-dischargeable under this provision. We agree.\n\nD.         Conclusion\n\n           The judgment of the district court that Baylis's debt is\n\nnon-dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523 (a)(4) is affirmed as to the\n\npart of the judgment based on the lawsuit, $27,322.90, and the pre-\n\njudgment interest attached, and reversed as to the award for loss\n\nof   property   value   and   consequent   pre-judgment   interest.   The\n\njudgment of the district court that Baylis's debt is not non-\n\ndischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6) is affirmed.

The issue is one of first impression for this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe the facts as they are set forth in the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), as supplemented by the state probate court findings, in the underlying state litigation which gives rise to the judgment debt against Carl Baylis, the bankrupt debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1969, Antonia Quevillon, the settlor of the Antonia Quevillon Trust, consulted Baylis, an attorney, regarding the disposition of the apartment buildings she owned and operated. At that time, she was seventy years old and in poor health. She had no prior relationship with Baylis. Baylis drafted the trust into which she transferred her property. The property consisted of eight apartment buildings in Massachusetts: six in Southbridge and two in Worcester. Baylis also drafted an exculpatory clause into the trust which stated that \"[e]ach trustee shall be liable only for his own willful misconduct or omissions in bad faith.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quevillon died on May 10, 1971. After her death, the trust was to provide income to her children for a period of twenty years at which point it would terminate, and the trust property was to be divided equally among the children of Marcel Quevillon, a son of the settlor. (It did so terminate on May 10, 1991.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis and Estelle Ballard, daughter of the settlor and one of the income beneficiaries, were appointed co-trustees; they served from May 1971 to May 1991. Ballard agreed to manage the property for $50 per week, and was paid from December 1973 through May 1991, for a total of $45,100. Not only did Ballard derive her income from managing the buildings, but she also lived in one unit, and the trust paid her utilities and provided items such as cable television and a washing machine. Baylis did not discuss any management fees with the settlor. By his own admission, he almost entirely abdicated his responsibilities as trustee to Ballard, who alone actively managed the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The property appreciated substantially in value from $256,000 in 1971 to $1.3 million in 1986, but paid the income beneficiaries only $48,813 between 1971 and 1985. The trustees had discretion to sell the trust property, and the trust did pay taxes and other expenses from the estate out of income derived from profits and the sale of a building in 1971. The trust sold another building in 1984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The income beneficiaries were taxed on the capital gains but did not receive any actual distribution of money. Concerned, the income beneficiaries met in 1985 with the co-trustees to discuss the lack of income from the trust property. The trustees acknowledged that each of the income beneficiaries was owed $82,000. This represented the amount, with interest, of the difference between the actual distributions received and the amount on which each of the beneficiaries had been taxed since May 10, 1971. Baylis told the beneficiaries that the trust was broke. At that meeting, it was decided that the property would be sold and the proceeds invested in government bonds. Ballard did not object to selling the properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1985, the trustees began accepting offers on the remaining six buildings. By January 1986, they had received an offer of $215,000 from Mr. and Mrs. Young for two of the Southbridge properties. The Ramshorn Realty Trust, in the business of purchasing and selling apartment buildings since 1986, made another offer, subject to the availability of financing, of $1.425 million for the other four properties. Ramshorn had recently sold substantial assets and had cash on hand to make a down payment. Both purchasers paid deposits of $1,000. The six properties were later appraised for only $1.3 million, significantly below the offers received of $1.64 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ballard, however, desired to own the properties herself. She also intended that the properties not be sold out of the family. Baylis, knowing this, presented the offers to her by letter dated February 5, 1986 and gave her an opportunity to match them, but it was soon evident that she could not finance the purchase. Baylis tried to cajole her into agreeing to sell to the offerors. She then refused to sell the property and later testified that she had not considered the interests of either the income beneficiaries or the remaindermen in making that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though Ballard had refused to sell the property, Baylis forwarded purchase and sale agreements to the prospective buyers on May 20, 1986. The buyers signed the agreements by June 3, 1986 and put down additional deposits. Baylis hoped to close on December 31, 1986, thinking that date would be advantageous for capital gains treatment. Baylis signed the agreement; Ballard refused to sign. Baylis did not go to probate court for instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis instead responded to Ballard on July 22, 1986 by proposing that Ballard would receive the two properties for which $215,000 had been offered, and would allow the other sale, to Ramshorn, to proceed. He did this although the Youngs had signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement that he himself had prepared. Ballard agreed to this proposal, subject to conditions. Baylis did not inform the Youngs of this development. He had appraisals done in anticipation of a license to sell the properties. The Youngs learned of this proposed sale to Ballard and sued the trust, the trustees, and Baylis in his individual capacity. The lawsuit sought specific performance of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and it alleged that Baylis had committed fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustees were served with the suit on December 13, 1986; after being served, Ballard then decided that she would not sell at all. As she put it, a sale would have left her \"out in the cold with nothing.\" The trust settled the case with the Youngs and paid the legal expenses associated with the suit. The Youngs' case continued against Baylis individually for fraud. The trust paid $7,000 for defense of the case against Baylis and $15,000 to settle it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis had prepared and filed a petition in Probate and Family Court for a license to sell the property in December 1986. The SJC later found, however, that Baylis did not disclose to the court Ballard's refusal to consent to the sale:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis's complaint, however, did not challenge Ballard's refusal at all. Instead the complaint he presented to the court stated that Ballard had submitted her resignation to Baylis and that he had accepted it. The judge, not knowing that Ballard was wrongfully refusing to consent, deferred judgment subject to obtaining Ballard's signature. Baylis never followed up by informing Ballard that she might be in breach of her fiduciary duty by not signing nor did he ask the judge to compel Ballard to agree to the sale. Because Baylis did not file a petition explaining to the judge that the sale would be in the best interests of the beneficiaries and that Ballard was improperly blocking the sale, he did not take the steps reasonably necessary to prevent Ballard from breaching her duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Rutanen v. Ballard,</i> 424 Mass. 723, 678 N.E.2d 133, 140 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The income beneficiaries filed suit in probate court against the trustees on May 23, 1988. The trust terminated on May 10, 1991, and the property was transferred to the remaindermen, who intervened in the suit. At that time, the estimated value of the property was $1.081 million. The probate court found that the Youngs and Ramshorn were ready, willing and able to purchase the trust properties, and Ballard and Baylis breached their fiduciary duties by failing to sell the properties in 1986. It also found that Baylis \"knowingly allow[ed] Ms. Ballard to breach her fiduciary duties without taking any action.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis claimed that the exculpatory clause he had drafted protected him. The probate court found that these breaches of fiduciary duty were in bad faith and therefore beyond the protection of the clause, and that even if the breaches were not in bad faith, the exculpatory clause was not enforceable because Baylis, a co-trustee, drafted the language, and the settlor was of ill health and had not been advised to seek the advice of outside counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probate court awarded judgments of $330,079.95 to the beneficiaries and $607,900.27 to the remaindermen on findings that the co-trustees had violated their fiduciary duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The damages included both the net proceeds from the sales and the profits resulting from the planned investment in six-month Treasury bills. <i>Rutanen v. Ballard,</i> No. 88E0072-G1, slip op. at 22-23 (Prob.Ct.Mass. Apr. 15, 1993); <i>Rutanen v. Ballard,</i> No. 88E0072-G1, slip op. at 1-2 (Prob.Ct.Mass. Nov. 4, 1993) (supplemental judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the probate court's decision, but solely on the ground that Baylis acted negligently and was not shielded by the exculpatory clause. <i>Rutanen,</i> 678 N.E.2d at 136, 140. As to the probate court's finding of bad faith, the SJC found that \"the evidence is more questionable\" and declined to rely on it in affirming the decision. <i>Id.</i> at 140.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the judgments against him, Baylis filed for bankruptcy. The trust's income beneficiaries, as creditors, took the position that their judgment against Baylis was non-dischargeable because the debt resulted from Baylis's \"defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity\" under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(4). In addition, they asserted the debts resulted from \"willful and malicious injury by the debtor ... to the property of another.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(6). The parties stipulated that the state probate court's findings of fact were binding, except for the finding that Baylis acted in bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides moved for summary judgment. Although styled as summary judgment, it is evident they expected the court to resolve the case on the stipulated record. The bankruptcy court held that the probate court's finding that Baylis had acted in bad faith had no preclusive effect because it was not essential to the judgment and had not been ruled on by the Supreme Judicial Court. <i>Rutanen v. Baylis,</i> 222 B.R. 1, 7 (Bankr.D.Mass.1998). It also found Baylis's conduct did not amount to defalcation. <i>Id.</i> at 5. The district court disagreed, holding that Baylis was bound by the probate court's bad faith finding, and as such had committed defalcation. <i>Rutanen v. Baylis,</i> No. 98-30174-NMG, slip op. at 12 (D.Mass. Oct. 29, 1999). This court found that the bad faith finding did not have a preclusive effect because the SJC had refused to affirm on that ground, and remanded the case to the district court. <i>Rutanen v. Baylis</i> (<i>In re Baylis</i>), 217 F.3d 66, 71 (1st Cir.2000). On remand, on cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court found that Baylis's conduct amounted to defalcation under &#167; 523(a)(4), and that &#167; 523(a)(6) was inapplicable. <i>Rutanen v. Baylis,</i> 275 B.R. 145, 153-54 (D.Mass.2002). Baylis appeals the &#167; 523(a)(4) determination against him; the plaintiffs cross-appeal the &#167; 523(a)(6) finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this case was decided on cross-motions for summary judgment, our review of the bankruptcy court decision is de novo. <i>See Piccicuto v. Dwyer,</i> 39 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir.1994). The standard by which to measure \"defalcation\" of a fiduciary duty for purposes of &#167; 523(a)(4) is a legal question, in any event, to which we give de novo review. The parties have agreed that they are bound by the probate court's findings of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Meaning of Defalcation of a Fiduciary Duty, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(4)</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code contains a number of exceptions to discharge of debt. Section 523(a) provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) A discharge ... does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) for fraud <i>or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,</i> embezzlement, or larceny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). This provision has been part of the Bankruptcy Act since 1867. <i>See</i> An act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy through the United States, ch.

The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2d ed.1989) defines defalcation as, \"A monetary deficiency through breach of trust by one who has the management or charge of funds; a fraudulent deficiency in money matters.\" 4 <i>id.</i> at 369. The <i>Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology</i> (C.T. Onuns ed., 1966) tells us that the word derives from the \"earlier defalk which survives in U.S. legal use. See &#8212; ation [is] diminution, reduction, curtailment..., defective, failure; fraudulent monetary deficiency.\" <i>Id.</i> at 250. The etymology of the word thus shows the term historically has covered both fraudulent and non-fraudulent acts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Our view is that not every breach of a fiduciary duty amounts to defalcation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law in this area is far from a seamless whole. More than sixty years ago, Judge Learned Hand's carefully equivocal opinion in <i>Herbst</i> held that there could be defalcation even in the absence of deliberate wrongdoing. Recognizing the ambiguities in the term, he noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All we decide is that when a fiduciary takes money upon a conditional authority which may be revoked and knows at the time that it may, he is guilty of a \"defalcation\" though it may not be a \"fraud,\" or an \"embezzlement,\" or perhaps not even a \"misappropriation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Herbst,</i> 93 F.2d at 512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roughly, three interpretive camps have been established as to the standard for measuring defalcation. The first is that an innocent mistake can constitute defalcation. <i>See Republic of Rwanda v. Uwimana</i> (<i>In re Uwimana</i>), 274 F.3d 806, 811 (4th Cir.2001) (self-dealing); <i>Tudor Oaks Ltd. P'ship v. Cochrane</i> (<i>In re Cochrane</i>), 124 F.3d 978, 984 (8th Cir.1997) (same); <i>Lewis v. Scott</i> (<i>In re Lewis</i>), 97 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.1996) (failure to account fully for money received). The second is that negligence by the fiduciary is required but no more. <i>See Antlers Roof-Truss &amp; Builders Supply v. Storie</i> (<i>In re Storie</i>), 216 B.R. 283, 288 (10th Cir.BAP 1997) (failure to account). The third is that at least recklessness by the fiduciary is required. <i>See Schwager v. Fallas</i> (<i>In re Schwager</i>), 121 F.3d 177, 185 (5th Cir.1997) (breach of duty to manage); <i>Meyer v. Rigdon,</i> 36 F.3d 1375, 1384-85 (7th Cir.1994) (same); <i>Carlisle Cashway, Inc. v.

The different camps not only exist between the different circuits, but sometimes within the bankruptcy courts of the same circuit, including this one. <i>Compare M-R Sullivan Mfg. Co. v. Sullivan</i> (<i>In re Sullivan</i>), 238 B.R. 230, 237-38 (Bankr.D.Mass.1999) (recklessness required, considering breach of duty to manage), <i>with Hoff v. Carroll</i> (<i>In re Carroll</i>), 140 B.R. 313, 316 (Bankr.D.Mass.1992) (negligence or ignorance enough for failure to account). The types of duty which the fiduciary has violated appear to influence the choice of standard regardless of the broad language sometimes used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present range of interpretations of \"defalcation\" among the circuits, from innocent mistake to a civil recklessness standard, does not, in our view, adequately capture Congress's intended meaning of the term in &#167; 523(a)(4). Instead, we find that a defalcation requires some degree of fault, closer to fraud, without the necessity of meeting a strict specific intent requirement. Our view is based on both the structure of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a) and the \"fresh start\" policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reading of &#167; 523 as a whole indicates that most of the exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy are in place for one of two basic reasons. First, bankruptcy may not be used to avoid the payment of certain types of debts, the repayment of which are important for policy reasons. Exceptions to discharge falling in this category include debts for: taxes or customs duties, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(1), or debts incurred to pay tax, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(14); alimony and child support payments, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(5); fines, penalties or forfeitures to the government, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(7); educational loans made or insured by the government or a nonprofit institution, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(8); orders of restitution, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(13); court fees, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(17); and support owed under state law and enforceable under the Social Security Act, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(18). The level of fault of the debtor has no bearing on these exceptions; the exception turns on the type of debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is arguable that defalcation by a fiduciary fits into this \"type of debt\" category &#8212; that is, that Congress intended to reinforce the high standard of care owed by fiduciaries by making debts for defalcation non-dischargeable. That reading is, we think, an unlikely one, and we see no strong federal interest in making every debt from breach of a fiduciary duty non-dischargeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other large category of bankruptcy exceptions relies on fault. These exceptions define not the type of debt itself, but the type of fault that caused the debt. Such exceptions include debts generated by: money, goods or services obtained by fraud or falsehood, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(2); willful and malicious injury, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(6); death or injury caused by driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(9); and the exception we interpret here, \"fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also one exception that spans both categories: the exception \"for malicious or reckless failure\" to maintain capital of an insured depository institution to the extent required by federal regulatory agencies. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(12). This exception combines a level of fault with a type of debt important for reasons of federal financial policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is evident from the above listings, those exceptions that rely exclusively on a level of fault concern extremely serious actions done knowingly or with great risk of harm to others. A charge of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs requires knowing ingestion of those substances with at least the attributed knowledge of consequent great risk that others will be injured. The exception for willful and malicious injury we discuss below also requires some form of intent. <i>Kawaauhau v. Geiger,</i> 523 U.S. 57, 61-62, 118 S.Ct. 974, 140 L.Ed.2d 90 (1998). Obtaining money, goods or services by criminal fraud or false pretenses also requires knowledge and more: a specific intent to defraud. <i>E.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (2000) (mail fraud); <i>United States v. Sawyer,</i> 239 F.3d 31, 40 (1st Cir.2001). Specific intent requires that the accused have the intent to accomplish the precise criminal act with which he is charged. <i>See Black's Law Dictionary, supra,</i> at 814. The structure of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523 as a whole, then, suggests that for an act to fall under the \"defalcation\" exception to discharge, it must be a serious one indeed, and some fault must be involved. The defalcation by a fiduciary, in our view, belongs in this category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation is buttressed by the structure of &#167; 523(a)(4) itself. First, the same line contains exceptions to discharge for fraud and defalcation while acting as a fiduciary, and embezzlement and larceny generally. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(4). Fraud, embezzlement, and larceny are all serious crimes requiring specific intent. To the extent that the term covers civil actions for fraud, such as a fraudulent misrepresentation, the maker of the statement must know or believe the statement is untrue or that he has no basis to make the statement. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 526 (1976). Moreover, it is telling that in &#167; 523(a)(4) fraud and defalcation are listed together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reading \"defalcation\" as akin to the other actions constituting fault-based exceptions to discharge is also consistent with the \"fresh start\" policy undergirding the bankruptcy system. The bankruptcy system is designed and used to obtain a fresh start for those owing debts of many kinds, including civil damages awards. Were this not so, the narrow exceptions in &#167; 523(a) would make little sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the term \"defalcation\" must mean something different than the other terms listed. \"In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\" <i>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</i> 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979). We believe that defalcation lessens the threshold required from one of criminal or civil fraud to something less. To show defalcation, a creditor need not prove that a debtor acted knowingly or willfully, in the sense of specific intent. However, a creditor must be able to show that a debtor's actions were so egregious that they come close to the level that would be required to prove fraud, embezzlement, or larceny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A debtor fiduciary may not escape the exclusion from discharge of his debt arising out of defalcation by saying he had no specific intent. As in other areas of the law, circumstances will provide the level of wrongdoing needed to constitute a defalcation. One useful analogy is to the law of securities, which requires \"scienter.\" Scienter, in the context of securities fraud, is \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. 185, 193 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). A form of recklessness can meet the requirement of scienter, but it is \"more like a lesser form of intent.\" <i>Rizek v. SEC,</i> 215 F.3d 157, 162 (1st Cir.2000). This form of recklessness is \"an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.\" <i>Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 185, 198 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>Sundstrand Corp. v. Sun Chem. Corp.,</i> 553 F.2d 1033, 1045 (7th Cir.1977)). The mental state required for defalcation is akin to the level of recklessness required for scienter. It is more than the mere conscious taking of risk associated with the usual torts standard of recklessness. <i>See Black's Law Dictionary, supra,</i> at 1276-77. Instead, defalcation requires something close to a showing of extreme recklessness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating whether there is a defalcation of a fiduciary duty, there must be reference to the duty involved. Of the various duties, the duty of loyalty is \"[t]he most fundamental duty owed ... the duty of a trustee to administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiaries.\" 2A A. Scott, <i>The Law of Trusts</i> &#167; 170 (W.F. Fratcher ed., 4th ed. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defalcation may be presumed from breach of the duty of loyalty, the duty not to act in the fiduciary's own interest when that interest comes or may come into conflict with the beneficiaries' interest: A trustee occupies a position in which the courts have fixed a very high and very strict standard for his conduct whenever his personal interest comes or may come into conflict with his duty to the beneficiaries. As long as he is not acting in his own interest the standard fixed for his behavior is only that of a reasonable degree of care, skill, and caution. But when the trustee acts in his own interest in connection with the performance of his duties as trustee, the standard of behavior becomes more rigorous. In such a case his interest must yield to that of the beneficiaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2A <i>id.</i> &#167; 170.25.

And he did more than merely ask Ballard to agree to the sales. He put pressure on her in two ways, first by presenting her with agreements signed by the buyers and later by filing a petition in court to sell the properties. Although he was adjudicated to have been negligent in not going further and requesting a court order against her, he surely was not in reckless disregard of his obligations concerning Ballard's fiduciary defaults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Rutanen,</i> 222 B.R. at 5. Ignoring the probate court's contrary finding, the bankruptcy court found nothing improper in the Trust's payment of the expenses of the suit against Baylis for fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court overturned the grant of summary judgment to Baylis and entered summary judgment for the creditors. It found that Baylis, by executing purchase and sale agreements even though Ballard refused to agree to a sale, \"practically assured a lawsuit.\" <i>Rutanen,</i> 275 B.R. at 152. Baylis also used trust funds in a resulting lawsuit brought against him personally, not only to pay attorneys' fees, but also to settle the lawsuit. <i>Id.</i> at 153. Finally, the district court noted that \"Baylis is an attorney who specializes in the law of trusts and estates. He was well aware of the duties required of a fiduciary under trust law.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both courts treated the question of the dischargeability of the debt as a unitary one. We think it more helpful to consider the different components of the judgment debt. The judgment debt comprises three elements: $27,322.90 for the trust expenditures for Baylis's benefit on the Youngs' lawsuit against him; over $937,000 for the loss in value of the property due to the failure to sell; and the pre-judgment interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the $27,322 payment for Baylis's benefit in the lawsuit against him by the Youngs and the associated interest. Of course, not all payments from a trust to trustees are inappropriate. Trustees may receive fees and be reimbursed for expenses. They may be defended and indemnified in lawsuits. Nevertheless, the impropriety of those payments here was resolved by the state courts, and that is a binding ruling. <i>See Rutanen,</i> No. 88E0072-G1, slip op. at 22 (Apr. 15, 1993). The probate court found that although the trust had no obligation to defend Baylis on the fraud charges brought against him personally or to indemnify him, Baylis caused fees for his defense to be paid by the Trust. That wrongdoing was compounded by Baylis having the trust pay the $15,000 it took to settle the Youngs' claims of fraud against him personally. Baylis is bound by the probate court's holding, affirmed by the SJC, that these payments were inappropriate. <i>See Montana v. United States,</i> 440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S.Ct. 970, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis's actions as to this component of the debt do constitute defalcation. Baylis's actions were in violation of his duty of loyalty. He used trust monies to pay the attorney's fees and settle the lawsuit brought by the Youngs. His breach of the duty of loyalty is exacerbated by the fact that Baylis, in breach of various fiduciary duties, brought about the conditions that led to the lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even after it was apparent to him that Ballard, his co-trustee, had refused to assent to a sale of property to either the Youngs or to Ramshorn, Baylis forwarded purchase and sale agreements to both prospective buyers, who signed them and put down deposits. He thus virtually guaranteed the ensuing litigation with the Youngs, which led to a wasting of the trust's assets in defending and settling the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given Baylis's active role in creating the conflict over which the Youngs were suing, he should have requested permission from the probate court before he used trust assets to defend himself against the personal aspects of the Youngs' lawsuit. He did not do so. Instead, he proceeded to use trust assets to defend himself, an extremely reckless thing to do in light of his duty of loyalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this combination of the fiduciary breach which caused the lawsuit and the self-dealing to defend against it, we find that Baylis's actions here constitute defalcation under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(4). Thus, the $27,322 of the judgment debt relating to these actions is non-dischargeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the remaining damages attributed to the loss in value of the trust from the failure to sell the property resulted from defalcation presents a different question. Baylis, as co-trustee, was obliged to participate in the administration of the trust and to use reasonable care to prevent a co-trustee from committing a breach of the trust. <i>Rutanen,</i> 678 N.E.2d at 140 (citing <i>Restatement (Second) of Trusts</i> &#167; 184 (1959)). Co-trustees may not acquiesce in the other trustee's refusal to exercise a power the trustees are obligated to exercise. <i>Id.</i> Should that occur, the co-trustee must apply to the courts for instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis argues he acted reasonably in compliance with these obligations when he applied to the probate court in December 1986 to conduct a sale, and so any breach cannot be a defalcation. \"Reasonableness,\" as we have said, is not the test for whether a breach is a defalcation, but if the trustee has acted reasonably, there is no defalcation. For the prior 15 years, Baylis had let Ballard manage the trust properties, largely ignoring his obligations, yet during most of those 15 years it was not evident that Ballard was in breach of her fiduciary obligations. Still, Ballard's breach of her own duty of loyalty around the time of the proposed sales was sufficiently egregious as to amount to a defalcation. It is a different matter whether her co-trustee's failure to bring her defalcation to the attention of the probate court was itself a defalcation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are troubled by the fact that when Baylis went to the probate court for instructions to sell, he failed to disclose material information to the court. He did not describe the co-trustee's conflict of interest, her breach of fiduciary duty, or the facts giving rise to the problem. Nonetheless, it was not unreasonable for Baylis to think that the matter would be resolved if the court gave instructions to sell the property. His various judgments about how best to handle his troublesome co-trustee were flawed and clearly negligent, but not so reckless as to rise to the level of fault needed to constitute a defalcation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Section 523(a)(6)</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the income beneficiaries allege that Baylis's debt is non-dischargeable because it is a \"willful and malicious injury by a debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.\" &#167; 523(a)(6). As interpreted by <i>Kawaauhau,</i> 523 U.S. at 58, 118 S.Ct. 974, \"the actor [must] intend the <i>consequences</i> of an act, not simply the act itself.\" <i>Id.</i> at 61-62, 118 S.Ct. 974 (emphasis in original); <i>see Roumeliotis v. Popa</i> (<i>In re Popa</i>), 140 F.3d 317, 318 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the bankruptcy nor the district court found willfulness and intent to injure. <i>Rutanen,</i> 275 B.R. at 154; <i>Rutanen,</i> 222 B.R. at 8.

The issue is one of first impression for this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe the facts as they are set forth in the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), as supplemented by the state probate court findings, in the underlying state litigation which gives rise to the judgment debt against Carl Baylis, the bankrupt debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1969, Antonia Quevillon, the settlor of the Antonia Quevillon Trust, consulted Baylis, an attorney, regarding the disposition of the apartment buildings she owned and operated. At that time, she was seventy years old and in poor health. She had no prior relationship with Baylis. Baylis drafted the trust into which she transferred her property. The property consisted of eight apartment buildings in Massachusetts: six in Southbridge and two in Worcester. Baylis also drafted an exculpatory clause into the trust which stated that \"[e]ach trustee shall be liable only for his own willful misconduct or omissions in bad faith.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quevillon died on May 10, 1971. After her death, the trust was to provide income to her children for a period of twenty years at which point it would terminate, and the trust property was to be divided equally among the children of Marcel Quevillon, a son of the settlor. (It did so terminate on May 10, 1991.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis and Estelle Ballard, daughter of the settlor and one of the income beneficiaries, were appointed co-trustees; they served from May 1971 to May 1991. Ballard agreed to manage the property for $50 per week, and was paid from December 1973 through May 1991, for a total of $45,100. Not only did Ballard derive her income from managing the buildings, but she also lived in one unit, and the trust paid her utilities and provided items such as cable television and a washing machine. Baylis did not discuss any management fees with the settlor. By his own admission, he almost entirely abdicated his responsibilities as trustee to Ballard, who alone actively managed the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The property appreciated substantially in value from $256,000 in 1971 to $1.3 million in 1986, but paid the income beneficiaries only $48,813 between 1971 and 1985. The trustees had discretion to sell the trust property, and the trust did pay taxes and other expenses from the estate out of income derived from profits and the sale of a building in 1971. The trust sold another building in 1984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The income beneficiaries were taxed on the capital gains but did not receive any actual distribution of money. Concerned, the income beneficiaries met in 1985 with the co-trustees to discuss the lack of income from the trust property. The trustees acknowledged that each of the income beneficiaries was owed $82,000. This represented the amount, with interest, of the difference between the actual distributions received and the amount on which each of the beneficiaries had been taxed since May 10, 1971. Baylis told the beneficiaries that the trust was broke. At that meeting, it was decided that the property would be sold and the proceeds invested in government bonds. Ballard did not object to selling the properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1985, the trustees began accepting offers on the remaining six buildings. By January 1986, they had received an offer of $215,000 from Mr. and Mrs. Young for two of the Southbridge properties. The Ramshorn Realty Trust, in the business of purchasing and selling apartment buildings since 1986, made another offer, subject to the availability of financing, of $1.425 million for the other four properties. Ramshorn had recently sold substantial assets and had cash on hand to make a down payment. Both purchasers paid deposits of $1,000. The six properties were later appraised for only $1.3 million, significantly below the offers received of $1.64 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ballard, however, desired to own the properties herself. She also intended that the properties not be sold out of the family. Baylis, knowing this, presented the offers to her by letter dated February 5, 1986 and gave her an opportunity to match them, but it was soon evident that she could not finance the purchase. Baylis tried to cajole her into agreeing to sell to the offerors. She then refused to sell the property and later testified that she had not considered the interests of either the income beneficiaries or the remaindermen in making that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though Ballard had refused to sell the property, Baylis forwarded purchase and sale agreements to the prospective buyers on May 20, 1986. The buyers signed the agreements by June 3, 1986 and put down additional deposits. Baylis hoped to close on December 31, 1986, thinking that date would be advantageous for capital gains treatment. Baylis signed the agreement; Ballard refused to sign. Baylis did not go to probate court for instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis instead responded to Ballard on July 22, 1986 by proposing that Ballard would receive the two properties for which $215,000 had been offered, and would allow the other sale, to Ramshorn, to proceed. He did this although the Youngs had signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement that he himself had prepared. Ballard agreed to this proposal, subject to conditions. Baylis did not inform the Youngs of this development. He had appraisals done in anticipation of a license to sell the properties. The Youngs learned of this proposed sale to Ballard and sued the trust, the trustees, and Baylis in his individual capacity. The lawsuit sought specific performance of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and it alleged that Baylis had committed fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustees were served with the suit on December 13, 1986; after being served, Ballard then decided that she would not sell at all. As she put it, a sale would have left her \"out in the cold with nothing.\" The trust settled the case with the Youngs and paid the legal expenses associated with the suit. The Youngs' case continued against Baylis individually for fraud. The trust paid $7,000 for defense of the case against Baylis and $15,000 to settle it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis had prepared and filed a petition in Probate and Family Court for a license to sell the property in December 1986. The SJC later found, however, that Baylis did not disclose to the court Ballard's refusal to consent to the sale:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis's complaint, however, did not challenge Ballard's refusal at all. Instead the complaint he presented to the court stated that Ballard had submitted her resignation to Baylis and that he had accepted it. The judge, not knowing that Ballard was wrongfully refusing to consent, deferred judgment subject to obtaining Ballard's signature. Baylis never followed up by informing Ballard that she might be in breach of her fiduciary duty by not signing nor did he ask the judge to compel Ballard to agree to the sale. Because Baylis did not file a petition explaining to the judge that the sale would be in the best interests of the beneficiaries and that Ballard was improperly blocking the sale, he did not take the steps reasonably necessary to prevent Ballard from breaching her duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Rutanen v.

The trust terminated on May 10, 1991, and the property was transferred to the remaindermen, who intervened in the suit. At that time, the estimated value of the property was $1.081 million. The probate court found that the Youngs and Ramshorn were ready, willing and able to purchase the trust properties, and Ballard and Baylis breached their fiduciary duties by failing to sell the properties in 1986. It also found that Baylis \"knowingly allow[ed] Ms. Ballard to breach her fiduciary duties without taking any action.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis claimed that the exculpatory clause he had drafted protected him. The probate court found that these breaches of fiduciary duty were in bad faith and therefore beyond the protection of the clause, and that even if the breaches were not in bad faith, the exculpatory clause was not enforceable because Baylis, a co-trustee, drafted the language, and the settlor was of ill health and had not been advised to seek the advice of outside counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probate court awarded judgments of $330,079.95 to the beneficiaries and $607,900.27 to the remaindermen on findings that the co-trustees had violated their fiduciary duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The damages included both the net proceeds from the sales and the profits resulting from the planned investment in six-month Treasury bills. <i>Rutanen v.

As to the probate court's finding of bad faith, the SJC found that \"the evidence is more questionable\" and declined to rely on it in affirming the decision. <i>Id.</i> at 140.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the judgments against him, Baylis filed for bankruptcy. The trust's income beneficiaries, as creditors, took the position that their judgment against Baylis was non-dischargeable because the debt resulted from Baylis's \"defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity\" under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(4). In addition, they asserted the debts resulted from \"willful and malicious injury by the debtor ... to the property of another.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(6). The parties stipulated that the state probate court's findings of fact were binding, except for the finding that Baylis acted in bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides moved for summary judgment. Although styled as summary judgment, it is evident they expected the court to resolve the case on the stipulated record. The bankruptcy court held that the probate court's finding that Baylis had acted in bad faith had no preclusive effect because it was not essential to the judgment and had not been ruled on by the Supreme Judicial Court. <i>Rutanen v.

It also found Baylis's conduct did not amount to defalcation. <i>Id.</i> at 5. The district court disagreed, holding that Baylis was bound by the probate court's bad faith finding, and as such had committed defalcation. <i>Rutanen v. Baylis,</i> No. 98-30174-NMG, slip op. at 12 (D.Mass. Oct. 29, 1999). This court found that the bad faith finding did not have a preclusive effect because the SJC had refused to affirm on that ground, and remanded the case to the district court. <i>Rutanen v.

On remand, on cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court found that Baylis's conduct amounted to defalcation under &#167; 523(a)(4), and that &#167; 523(a)(6) was inapplicable. <i>Rutanen v.

The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2d ed.1989) defines defalcation as, \"A monetary deficiency through breach of trust by one who has the management or charge of funds; a fraudulent deficiency in money matters.\" 4 <i>id.</i> at 369. The <i>Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology</i> (C.T. Onuns ed., 1966) tells us that the word derives from the \"earlier defalk which survives in U.S. legal use. See &#8212; ation [is] diminution, reduction, curtailment..., defective, failure; fraudulent monetary deficiency.\" <i>Id.</i> at 250. The etymology of the word thus shows the term historically has covered both fraudulent and non-fraudulent acts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Our view is that not every breach of a fiduciary duty amounts to defalcation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law in this area is far from a seamless whole. More than sixty years ago, Judge Learned Hand's carefully equivocal opinion in <i>Herbst</i> held that there could be defalcation even in the absence of deliberate wrongdoing. Recognizing the ambiguities in the term, he noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All we decide is that when a fiduciary takes money upon a conditional authority which may be revoked and knows at the time that it may, he is guilty of a \"defalcation\" though it may not be a \"fraud,\" or an \"embezzlement,\" or perhaps not even a \"misappropriation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Herbst,</i> 93 F.2d at 512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roughly, three interpretive camps have been established as to the standard for measuring defalcation.

The types of duty which the fiduciary has violated appear to influence the choice of standard regardless of the broad language sometimes used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present range of interpretations of \"defalcation\" among the circuits, from innocent mistake to a civil recklessness standard, does not, in our view, adequately capture Congress's intended meaning of the term in &#167; 523(a)(4). Instead, we find that a defalcation requires some degree of fault, closer to fraud, without the necessity of meeting a strict specific intent requirement. Our view is based on both the structure of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a) and the \"fresh start\" policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reading of &#167; 523 as a whole indicates that most of the exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy are in place for one of two basic reasons. First, bankruptcy may not be used to avoid the payment of certain types of debts, the repayment of which are important for policy reasons. Exceptions to discharge falling in this category include debts for: taxes or customs duties, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(1), or debts incurred to pay tax, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(14); alimony and child support payments, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(5); fines, penalties or forfeitures to the government, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(7); educational loans made or insured by the government or a nonprofit institution, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(8); orders of restitution, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(13); court fees, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(17); and support owed under state law and enforceable under the Social Security Act, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(18). The level of fault of the debtor has no bearing on these exceptions; the exception turns on the type of debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is arguable that defalcation by a fiduciary fits into this \"type of debt\" category &#8212; that is, that Congress intended to reinforce the high standard of care owed by fiduciaries by making debts for defalcation non-dischargeable. That reading is, we think, an unlikely one, and we see no strong federal interest in making every debt from breach of a fiduciary duty non-dischargeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other large category of bankruptcy exceptions relies on fault. These exceptions define not the type of debt itself, but the type of fault that caused the debt. Such exceptions include debts generated by: money, goods or services obtained by fraud or falsehood, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(2); willful and malicious injury, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(6); death or injury caused by driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(9); and the exception we interpret here, \"fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also one exception that spans both categories: the exception \"for malicious or reckless failure\" to maintain capital of an insured depository institution to the extent required by federal regulatory agencies. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(12). This exception combines a level of fault with a type of debt important for reasons of federal financial policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is evident from the above listings, those exceptions that rely exclusively on a level of fault concern extremely serious actions done knowingly or with great risk of harm to others. A charge of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs requires knowing ingestion of those substances with at least the attributed knowledge of consequent great risk that others will be injured. The exception for willful and malicious injury we discuss below also requires some form of intent. <i>Kawaauhau v. Geiger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118179\"><a href=\"/opinion/118179/kawaauhau-v-geiger/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 61-62, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118179\"><a href=\"/opinion/118179/kawaauhau-v-geiger/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span> (1998). Obtaining money, goods or services by criminal fraud or false pretenses also requires knowledge and more: a specific intent to defraud. <i>E.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (2000) (mail fraud); <i>United States v. Sawyer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199256\"><a href=\"/opinion/199256/sawyer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2001). Specific intent requires that the accused have the intent to accomplish the precise criminal act with which he is charged. <i>See Black's Law Dictionary, supra,</i> at 814. The structure of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523 as a whole, then, suggests that for an act to fall under the \"defalcation\" exception to discharge, it must be a serious one indeed, and some fault must be involved. The defalcation by a fiduciary, in our view, belongs in this category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation is buttressed by the structure of &#167; 523(a)(4) itself. First, the same line contains exceptions to discharge for fraud and defalcation while acting as a fiduciary, and embezzlement and larceny generally. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 523(a)(4). Fraud, embezzlement, and larceny are all serious crimes requiring specific intent. To the extent that the term covers civil actions for fraud, such as a fraudulent misrepresentation, the maker of the statement must know or believe the statement is untrue or that he has no basis to make the statement. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 526 (1976). Moreover, it is telling that in &#167; 523(a)(4) fraud and defalcation are listed together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reading \"defalcation\" as akin to the other actions constituting fault-based exceptions to discharge is also consistent with the \"fresh start\" policy undergirding the bankruptcy system. The bankruptcy system is designed and used to obtain a fresh start for those owing debts of many kinds, including civil damages awards. Were this not so, the narrow exceptions in &#167; 523(a) would make little sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the term \"defalcation\" must mean something different than the other terms listed. \"In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\" <i>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 339, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span> (1979). We believe that defalcation lessens the threshold required from one of criminal or civil fraud to something less. To show defalcation, a creditor need not prove that a debtor acted knowingly or willfully, in the sense of specific intent. However, a creditor must be able to show that a debtor's actions were so egregious that they come close to the level that would be required to prove fraud, embezzlement, or larceny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A debtor fiduciary may not escape the exclusion from discharge of his debt arising out of defalcation by saying he had no specific intent. As in other areas of the law, circumstances will provide the level of wrongdoing needed to constitute a defalcation. One useful analogy is to the law of securities, which requires \"scienter.\" Scienter, in the context of securities fraud, is \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109420\"><a href=\"/opinion/109420/ernst-ernst-v-hochfelder/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 193 n. 12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109420\"><a href=\"/opinion/109420/ernst-ernst-v-hochfelder/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1976). A form of recklessness can meet the requirement of scienter, but it is \"more like a lesser form of intent.\" <i>Rizek v.

This form of recklessness is \"an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.\" <i>Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198674\"><a href=\"/opinion/198674/greebel-v-ftp-software-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 198 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>Sundstrand Corp. v.

The mental state required for defalcation is akin to the level of recklessness required for scienter. It is more than the mere conscious taking of risk associated with the usual torts standard of recklessness. <i>See Black's Law Dictionary, supra,</i> at 1276-77.

As long as he is not acting in his own interest the standard fixed for his behavior is only that of a reasonable degree of care, skill, and caution. But when the trustee acts in his own interest in connection with the performance of his duties as trustee, the standard of behavior becomes more rigorous.

It found that Baylis, by executing purchase and sale agreements even though Ballard refused to agree to a sale, \"practically assured a lawsuit.\" <i>Rutanen,</i> 275 B.R. at 152. Baylis also used trust funds in a resulting lawsuit brought against him personally, not only to pay attorneys' fees, but also to settle the lawsuit. <i>Id.</i> at 153.

We think it more helpful to consider the different components of the judgment debt. The judgment debt comprises three elements: $27,322.90 for the trust expenditures for Baylis's benefit on the Youngs' lawsuit against him; over $937,000 for the loss in value of the property due to the failure to sell; and the pre-judgment interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the $27,322 payment for Baylis's benefit in the lawsuit against him by the Youngs and the associated interest. Of course, not all payments from a trust to trustees are inappropriate. Trustees may receive fees and be reimbursed for expenses. They may be defended and indemnified in lawsuits. Nevertheless, the impropriety of those payments here was resolved by the state courts, and that is a binding ruling. <i>See Rutanen,</i> No. 88E0072-G1, slip op. at 22 (Apr. 15, 1993). The probate court found that although the trust had no obligation to defend Baylis on the fraud charges brought against him personally or to indemnify him, Baylis caused fees for his defense to be paid by the Trust. That wrongdoing was compounded by Baylis having the trust pay the $15,000 it took to settle the Youngs' claims of fraud against him personally. Baylis is bound by the probate court's holding, affirmed by the SJC, that these payments were inappropriate. <i>See Montana v.

Baylis's actions were in violation of his duty of loyalty. He used trust monies to pay the attorney's fees and settle the lawsuit brought by the Youngs. His breach of the duty of loyalty is exacerbated by the fact that Baylis, in breach of various fiduciary duties, brought about the conditions that led to the lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even after it was apparent to him that Ballard, his co-trustee, had refused to assent to a sale of property to either the Youngs or to Ramshorn, Baylis forwarded purchase and sale agreements to both prospective buyers, who signed them and put down deposits. He thus virtually guaranteed the ensuing litigation with the Youngs, which led to a wasting of the trust's assets in defending and settling the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given Baylis's active role in creating the conflict over which the Youngs were suing, he should have requested permission from the probate court before he used trust assets to defend himself against the personal aspects of the Youngs' lawsuit. He did not do so. Instead, he proceeded to use trust assets to defend himself, an extremely reckless thing to do in light of his duty of loyalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this combination of the fiduciary breach which caused the lawsuit and the self-dealing to defend against it, we find that Baylis's actions here constitute defalcation under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(4). Thus, the $27,322 of the judgment debt relating to these actions is non-dischargeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the remaining damages attributed to the loss in value of the trust from the failure to sell the property resulted from defalcation presents a different question. Baylis, as co-trustee, was obliged to participate in the administration of the trust and to use reasonable care to prevent a co-trustee from committing a breach of the trust. <i>Rutanen,</i> 678 N.E.2d at 140 (citing <i>Restatement (Second) of Trusts</i> &#167; 184 (1959)). Co-trustees may not acquiesce in the other trustee's refusal to exercise a power the trustees are obligated to exercise. <i>Id.</i> Should that occur, the co-trustee must apply to the courts for instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baylis argues he acted reasonably in compliance with these obligations when he applied to the probate court in December 1986 to conduct a sale, and so any breach cannot be a defalcation. \"Reasonableness,\" as we have said, is not the test for whether a breach is a defalcation, but if the trustee has acted reasonably, there is no defalcation. For the prior 15 years, Baylis had let Ballard manage the trust properties, largely ignoring his obligations, yet during most of those 15 years it was not evident that Ballard was in breach of her fiduciary obligations. Still, Ballard's breach of her own duty of loyalty around the time of the proposed sales was sufficiently egregious as to amount to a defalcation. It is a different matter whether her co-trustee's failure to bring her defalcation to the attention of the probate court was itself a defalcation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are troubled by the fact that when Baylis went to the probate court for instructions to sell, he failed to disclose material information to the court. He did not describe the co-trustee's conflict of interest, her breach of fiduciary duty, or the facts giving rise to the problem. Nonetheless, it was not unreasonable for Baylis to think that the matter would be resolved if the court gave instructions to sell the property. His various judgments about how best to handle his troublesome co-trustee were flawed and clearly negligent, but not so reckless as to rise to the level of fault needed to constitute a defalcation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Section 523(a)(6)</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the income beneficiaries allege that Baylis's debt is non-dischargeable because it is a \"willful and malicious injury by a debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.\" &#167; 523(a)(6).
