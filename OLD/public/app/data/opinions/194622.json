Attorney Richard Lubart, having obtained an\n               \n\naward  of  Social  Security  benefits  for  his  client  (the\n\nplaintiff here), challenges an award of attorney's fees under\n\n  206(b) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.   406(b).  The\n\ndistrict  court ordered  that the  entire    206(b) award  of\n\n$4,353.25 be remitted by Lubart to his client, given the fact\n\nthat  a  larger fees  award  had previously  been  granted to\n\nLubart under  the  Equal Access  to  Justice Act  (EAJA),  28\n\nU.S.C.    2412(d).   See, e.g.,  Pub. L. No.  99-80,    3, 99\n                              \n\nStat.  186, amending Pub. L.  No. 96-481,    206 (codified as\n                    \n\nnote to  28 U.S.C.    2412) (\"where  the claimant's  attorney\n\nreceives  fees for  the same  work under  both [   206(b) and\n\nEAJA],  the  claimant's  attorney  [shall]  refund[]  to  the\n\nclaimant  the  amount of  the  smaller  fee\").1   Lubart  now\n\nargues  that he should be permitted to retain $304.43 of this\n\naward  for  himself--an  amount  corresponding  to 2.5  hours\n\nwhich, he  states,  were not  included  in the  earlier  EAJA\n\naward.  This argument fails for several reasons. \n\n     Lubart  misconceives  the  nature  of  the  EAJA  offset\n\nprovision.  As would appear plain from the statutory language\n\n                    \n\n1.  As we explained in Trinidad v. Secretary of HHS, 935 F.2d\n                                                   \n13, 16  (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam): \"An award of fees under\n[ 206(b)]   is  deducted   from  the   claimant's  disability\nbenefits, whereas  an EAJA  award is  paid separately  by the\ngovernment.\"   It  is for  this reason  that an  attorney may\nrequest fees  under both  provisions; \"the  EAJA compensation\n... serves as a  reimbursement to the claimant for  fees paid\nout of the disability award.\"  Id.\n                                  \n\n                             -2-\n\nquoted above, this mechanism requires simply that the smaller\n\nof the  two fees awards be remitted to the client.  The House\n\nReport accompanying  the 1985  enactment made the  point even\n\nmore clearly:\n\n     [T]he EAJA award  should be  used as a  set off  to\n     reduce  the  payment   which  the  claimant   would\n     otherwise owe the attorney.   Thus, ... an attorney\n                                                        \n     for  a Social  Security  or SSI  claimant would  be\n                                                        \n     precluded  from  receiving  both  EAJA  and  Social\n                                                        \n     Security Act  fees.  Without this  amendment it was\n                        \n     argued, \"double dipping\" was possible.  Such double\n     payments  are  inappropriate   and  deprive[]   the\n     plaintiff  of  the  benefits intended  by  EAJA....\n     [T]he  attorney  [is  permitted]  to  seek recovery\n     under  both authorizations.  The attorney, however,\n                                                        \n     may keep the larger fee, but must return the amount\n                                                        \n     of the smaller fee to the claimant.\n                                        \n\nH. Rep.  No. 99-120,  at 20,  reprinted in  1985 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n                                          \n\n132,  148-49  (emphasis  added).    See,  e.g.,  Trinidad  v.\n                                                         \n\nSecretary  of HHS,  935  F.2d 13,  16  (1st Cir.  1991)  (per\n                 \n\ncuriam) (\"double  recovery is prevented in  that the attorney\n\nmust  refund the amount of the smaller fee to the claimant\");\n\nRussell  v. Sullivan, 930  F.2d 1443,  1446 (9th  Cir. 1991);\n                    \n\nLopez v. Sullivan, 882  F.2d 1533, 1537-38 (10th Cir.  1989);\n                 \n\nWells  v. Bowen,  855 F.2d 37,  42 (2d  Cir. 1988).   We find\n               \n\nnothing in the statutory  language or history or in  the case\n\nlaw  to  suggest  that  a  court  is  required  to  take  the\n\nadditional steps proposed by  Lubart--i.e., to parse the EAJA\n\nand   206(b) applications on  an hour-by-hour basis and remit\n\nto the client only that  portion of the smaller fee  which is\n\nencompassed by the larger.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Moreover,  even  if   such  an   undertaking  might   be\n\nappropriate in  other  contexts, it  plainly was  unwarranted\n\nhere.   Of the  2.5 hours  in question,  1.5 were  devoted to\n\npreparation  of  the    206(b)  application.   Time  spent on\n\npreparing  and  litigating  a    206(b)  application  is  not\n\ncompensable.   See, e.g., Craig v. Secretary of HHS, 864 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n324, 328 (4th Cir. 1989); Coup v. Heckler, 834 F.2d 313,  325\n                                         \n\n(3d Cir. 1987).  The  government objected to the  application\n\non  this ground (without rebuttal  by Lubart), and  it can be\n\nfairly  assumed  that  such  time  was not  included  in  the\n\ndistrict court  award.2   The remaining hour  was devoted  to\n\nsettlement of the earlier EAJA application.  In contrast to  \n\n206(b), such  time is  compensable  under EAJA.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nCommissioner of INS  v. Jean, 496 U.S.  154 (1990); Trinidad,\n                                                            \n\n935 F.2d at 17.  Given that Lubart and the government reached\n\na settlement as to the appropriate EAJA award (which afforded\n\nLubart  63 percent of his initial request), it cannot be said\n\nwith certainty  that this  time was not  encompassed therein.\n\nBut even  if not, it could  have been.  The  fact that Lubart\n\nchose  not  to include  it in  the  EAJA request  provides no\n\n                    \n\n2.  As requested by Lubart, the district court simply awarded\na flat sum  (equivalent to 25 percent  of claimant's past-due\nbenefits, see     206(b), less  the amount awarded  therefrom\n             \nunder   206(a) for  counsel's work before the agency).   This\ncircumstance  made it  unnecessary to  specify the  number of\nhours or the hourly rate.\n\n                             -4-\n\nwarrant  for  reducing the  amount  of  reimbursement to  his\n\nclient.\n\n     Finally,  we  note  that  Lubart failed  to  raise  this\n\nspecific argument before the district court.  In two separate\n\nsubmissions,   he   advanced   two   separate   theories  for\n\nwithholding a portion of the remittance from his client.  The\n\ntheory he now  proffers, however, was not one  of them.  See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., Mariani v.

We find\n               \n\nnothing in the statutory  language or history or in  the case\n\nlaw  to  suggest  that  a  court  is  required  to  take  the\n\nadditional steps proposed by  Lubart--i.e., to parse the EAJA\n\nand   206(b) applications on  an hour-by-hour basis and remit\n\nto the client only that  portion of the smaller fee  which is\n\nencompassed by the larger.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Moreover,  even  if   such  an   undertaking  might   be\n\nappropriate in  other  contexts, it  plainly was  unwarranted\n\nhere.   Of the  2.5 hours  in question,  1.5 were  devoted to\n\npreparation  of  the    206(b)  application.   Time  spent on\n\npreparing  and  litigating  a    206(b)  application  is  not\n\ncompensable.   See, e.g., Craig v.

The  government objected to the  application\n\non  this ground (without rebuttal  by Lubart), and  it can be\n\nfairly  assumed  that  such  time  was not  included  in  the\n\ndistrict court  award.2   The remaining hour  was devoted  to\n\nsettlement of the earlier EAJA application.  In contrast to  \n\n206(b), such  time is  compensable  under EAJA.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nCommissioner of INS  v.

Given that Lubart and the government reached\n\na settlement as to the appropriate EAJA award (which afforded\n\nLubart  63 percent of his initial request), it cannot be said\n\nwith certainty  that this  time was not  encompassed therein.\n\nBut even  if not, it could  have been.  The  fact that Lubart\n\nchose  not  to include  it in  the  EAJA request  provides no\n\n                    \n\n2.  As requested by Lubart, the district court simply awarded\na flat sum  (equivalent to 25 percent  of claimant's past-due\nbenefits, see     206(b), less  the amount awarded  therefrom\n             \nunder   206(a) for  counsel's work before the agency).   This\ncircumstance  made it  unnecessary to  specify the  number of\nhours or the hourly rate.\n\n                             -4-\n\nwarrant  for  reducing the  amount  of  reimbursement to  his\n\nclient.\n\n     Finally,  we  note  that  Lubart failed  to  raise  this\n\nspecific argument before the district court.  In two separate\n\nsubmissions,   he   advanced   two   separate   theories  for\n\nwithholding a portion of the remittance from his client.  The\n\ntheory he now  proffers, however, was not one  of them.  See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., Mariani v.
