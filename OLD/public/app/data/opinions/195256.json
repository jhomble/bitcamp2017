This  appeal  requires us  to\r                    SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\r                                          \n\ndetermine whether the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.   \n\n2701-2721,  18  U.S.C.      1166-1168 (1988)  (the  Gaming  Act),\n\napplies  to lands now held in trust  by the United States for the\n\nbenefit of  the  Narragansett Indian  Tribe  (the Tribe).    This\n\ndetermination is  tinged with  more than  the  usual quotient  of\n\npublic  interest, because  the Tribe's  ability to  import casino\n\ngambling  into Rhode Island likely  hangs in the  balance.  After\n\ncareful  reconnaissance of  a  littered legal  landscape, we  set\n\naside  the  district  court's  determination  that  the  parties'\n\ndispute over the  applicability of state jurisdiction  is not yet\n\nripe  for   adjudication  and  hold  that   Congress's  grant  of\n\njurisdiction  to  the state  in  the Rhode  Island  Indian Claims\n\nSettlement  Act of 1978,  25 U.S.C.     1701-1716 (the Settlement\n\nAct),  remains  valid.   We also  hold,  contrary to  the Tribe's\n\nimportuning,   that   the   grant   includes   civil   regulatory\n\njurisdiction.\n\n          At that juncture, the tide turns.  We conclude, despite\n\nthe  state's  vehement protests,  that  the Gaming  Act  does not\n\nspecially exempt  the lands  in question; that  the Narragansetts\n\nhave  concurrent  jurisdiction  over, and  exercise  governmental\n\npower with respect  to, those lands, and, therefore, are entitled\n\nto  invoke  the Gaming  Act;  and  that,  to the  extent  of  the\n\njurisdictional conflict between the Settlement Act and the Gaming\n\nAct,  the former is  impliedly repealed.   In the  end, we affirm\n\nboth  the district court's directive that Rhode Island enter into\n\n                                2\r\n\ngood  faith negotiations  to draft  a tribal-state  compact under\n\nwhich gaming operations can  be mounted and its refusal  to grant\n\nrelief  to various  governmental  figures and  entities who  have\n\nchallenged   the   Tribe's  entitlement   to   the  extraordinary\n\nprophylaxis of the Gaming Act.\n\nI.  THE SETTLEMENT LANDS\r          I.  THE SETTLEMENT LANDS\n\n          We begin with a  thumbnail sketch of how the  land mass\n\nthat is the breeding ground  for this dispute came to be  held in\n\ntrust for the Tribe.\n\n          In the  late 1970s, the Tribe asserted  title claims to\n\ncertain lands  in  Charlestown, Rhode  Island, and,  encountering\n\nresistance, pursued these claims in the federal courts.  See Town\r                                                                           \n\nof Charlestown v. United States, 696 F. Supp. 800, 801-05 (D.R.I.\r                                         \n\n1988) (recounting history of dispute), aff'd, 873  F.2d 1433 (1st\r                                                      \n\nCir. 1989) (table).  In 1978,  the Tribe, the state, and the Town\n\nof Charlestown signed a joint memorandum of understanding (J-MEM)\n\npurporting  to settle their differences.  The Tribe agreed, inter\r                                                                           \n\nalia, to the extinguishment of  its title claims.  In  return, it\r              \n\nobtained valuable consideration, including a lump-sum payment and\n\neffective  control over  roughly 1800  acres in  Charlestown (the\n\nsettlement  lands), half donated by the state and half by private\n\nlandowners.1  The titleholders  agreed to deed the property  to a\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     1The  provenance of  the two  parcels remains  of continuing\nlegal relevance because the 900 acres donated by the state may be\nused only for conservation purposes.  See 6A R.I. Gen. Laws   37-\r                                                   \n18-14  (1990).    Thus,  the  development  plan  for  high-stakes\ngambling  is  of necessity  limited  to  the so-called  \"private\"\nportion of the settlement lands.\n\n                                3\r\n\nnascent corporation which would  be formed to hold title  for the\n\nTribe's benefit.\n\n          Because  Congress possesses  plenary power  over Indian\n\nmatters,  see Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 551-52 (1974), the\r                                         \n\nparties  sought its blessing.   In response,  Congress passed the\n\nSettlement Act, a law that, for the most part,  tracks the J-MEM.\n\nIn 1978,  the state legislature approved  the Narragansett Indian\n\nLand  Management Corporation Act, 6A R.I. Gen. Laws    37-18-1 to\n\n37-18-15  (1990) (the  State Act),  thereby creating  the nominee\n\ncorporation that would hold  title to the settlement lands.   The\n\nnecessary conveyancing followed.\n\n          The next  five years passed  without relevant incident.\n\nThen,  in 1983, the Secretary of the Interior, acting pursuant to\n\ndepartmental  regulations,  see  25   C.F.R.,  Part  83   (1993),\r                                         \n\nofficially recognized  the Narragansetts as an Indian tribe.  See\r                                                                           \n\n48 Fed. Reg.  6177-78 (Feb. 2,  1983).  On  the heels of  federal\n\nrecognition, the settlement  lands changed hands twice more.   In\n\n1985,  the Rhode Island General Assembly amended the State Act to\n\npermit the holding company to transfer  title to the Tribe.2  The\n\ncorporation  complied.  In September  of 1988, less  than a month\n                    \r                              \n\n     2The   State   Act   amendments   themselves   suggest  that\ncongressional  approval of  the  land transfer  is \"required  and\nappropriate,\"  6A R.I. Gen. Laws    37-18-14, and the case law is\nin  accord, see Oneida Indian  Nation v. Oneida  County, 414 U.S.\r                                                                 \n661, 667-68 (1974)  (explaining that, as  a general rule,  Indian\ntribes  may  not   alienate  their  land  without   congressional\nconsent).  Yet, Congress never ratified the State Act amendments.\nBecause the validity  of the  title transfer is  not directly  in\nissue  in  this  litigation,  and  because  appellants  have  not\nacknowledged, much less relied upon, the absence of ratification,\nwe do not explore the consequences of this omission.\n\n                                4\r\n\nbefore the Gaming Act became law, the Tribe deeded the settlement\n\nlands to the  federal Bureau  of Indian Affairs  (the Bureau)  as\n\ntrustee.\n\nII.  THE GAMING ACT\r          II.  THE GAMING ACT\n\n          The Gaming Act is an  expression of Congress's will  in\n\nrespect to  the incidence of gambling activities on Indian lands.\n\nThe statute  sets in place a  sophisticated regulatory framework,\n\ndefining  a species of gambling, called \"gaming,\" and dividing it\n\ninto tiers,  called \"classes.\"   Each class connotes  a different\n\nlevel  of  gambling activity  and,  consequently,  each class  is\n\nregulated to a  varying degree of stringency.   See 25 U.S.C.    \r                                                             \n\n2703(6) - 2703(8).\n\n          Class I gaming   which consists, essentially, of Indian\n\nritual gambling   always can  be conducted on Indian lands.   See\r                                                                           \n\n25  U.S.C.    2710(a)(1).   Class II  gaming    which encompasses\n\nbingo    can  be conducted  as of  right on  Indian lands  in any\n\nstate,  such as Rhode  Island, that does  not generally proscribe\n\nactivities of that type.   See 25 U.S.C.   2710(b)(1)(A).   Class\r                                        \n\nIII gaming   a  residual category that includes what  is commonly\n\nthought of as  casino gambling    is permitted  by compact;  and,\n\nmoreover, a state  is obliged to negotiate such a compact in good\n\nfaith with a sponsoring  tribe unless the state bans  all persons\n\nthroughout its territory from conducting  class III gaming.   See\r                                                                           \n\n25 U.S.C.   2710(d).   Short of an outright  ban   and few  state\n\n                                5\r\n\nlegislatures have indicated a  willingness to go that far3    the\n\ntribal-state compact is the  exclusive method of regulating class\n\nIII gaming.   The method of the Gaming Act  prevents a state from\n\nfrustrating the introduction  of class III  gaming by an  endless\n\nfilibuster,  for there  are  tight time  parameters within  which\n\ncompact negotiations must be  brought to fruition once a  federal\n\ncourt  finds that  a state has  failed to bargain  in good faith.\n\nSee id.    2710(d)(7)(B).  As  a practical matter, then,  a state\r                 \n\nordinarily may regulate  casino gambling on Indian  lands only in\n\npursuance of a consensual compact.\n\n          Because  the  case at  bar  revolves  around class  III\n\ngaming,  the   centrality   of  this   last   point   cannot   be\n\noverstated.  One of the Gaming Act's fundamental policies is that\n\n\"Indian  tribes  have  the  exclusive right  to  regulate  gaming\n\nactivity  on  Indian  lands .  .  .  .\"    Id.    2701(5).    The\r                                                        \n\nlegislative history of the statute draws  out the implications of\n\nthis policy:\n\n          The  mechanism  for facilitating  the unusual\n          relationship   in   which   a   tribe   might\n          affirmatively  seek  the  extension of  State\n          jurisdiction  and  the  application of  state\n          laws  to activities conducted  on Indian land\n          is a tribal-State  compact.   In no  instance\n          does   [the   Gaming  Act]   contemplate  the\n          extension  of  State   jurisdiction  or   the\n          application  of  State  laws  for  any  other\n          purpose.\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     3There are strong economic and political disincentives to an\noutright  ban,  for class  III  gaming  encompasses, among  other\nthings,  such popular sources of state  revenue as lotteries, and\nsuch  familiar  fundraising  devices  as \"Las  Vegas  nights\"  to\nbenefit churches and other charities.\n\n                                6\r\n\nS.

See\r                                                                           \n\nIrons  v.

Thus, the  courts have not focused on the\n\nwisdom  of  the policies  underlying  the  Gaming Act,  but  have\n\nfollowed  the  legislative  lead  and recognized  that  the  very\n\nstructure  of the Gaming Act forbids the assertion of state civil\n\nor criminal  jurisdiction over class  III gaming except  when the\n\ntribe  and the state have negotiated a compact that permits state\n\nintervention.

PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n\n          On January 15, 1992,  the Tribe formally requested that\n\nRhode Island enter into good faith bargaining designed to produce\n\na  tribal-state  compact  that   would  allow  construction   and\n\noperation of a casino, i.e., inauguration of class III gaming, on\r                                     \n\nthe  settlement  lands.    Rhode Island  declined  to  negotiate,\n\ninstead  filing suit in the  federal district court.4   The state\n                    \r                              \n\n     4As  matters now  stand,  the  named plaintiffs  (appellants\nbefore us) include  the state,  the town, and  various state  and\nmunicipal  officials.   For simplicity's  sake, we  refer  to the\n\n                                7\r\n\nasked the court to declare that the Gaming Act does  not apply to\n\nthe  settlement  lands,  and  that, therefore,  those  lands  are\n\nsubject  to  Rhode  Island's  general  criminal  and  civil  laws\n\n(including  its civil regulatory laws).  The state also sought to\n\nenjoin the  development of gambling facilities  on the settlement\n\nlands  and to  block  negotiations antecedent  to a  tribal-state\n\ncompact.   The Tribe answered and  counterclaimed for declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief that would pave the way for casino gambling\n\non  the  settlement lands.    The  tribe requested,  among  other\n\nthings, a  declaration that the state's civil  regulatory laws do\n\nnot  apply  to  the  settlement lands;  a  declaration  that  the\n\nNarragansetts are entitled to operate a class III casino on those\n\nlands  in  conformance with  the  Gaming  Act;  and  a  mandatory\n\ninjunction commanding the state to negotiate in good faith toward\n\na compact.\n\n          The district court considered cross motions for summary\n\njudgment premised  on a joint statement  of uncontroverted facts.\n\nAfter  pondering  the  parties'  proffers,  the   court  deferred\n\nsubstantive  consideration  of  the  dispute  over  the   general\n\napplicability  of state  and local jurisdiction,  citing ripeness\n\nconcerns.  See Rhode Island v. Narragansett Tribe of Indians, 816\r                                                                      \n\nF. Supp. 796, 799-800 (D.R.I. 1993).  The court then assumed, for\n\nargument's  sake, that  the state  had been  granted jurisdiction\n\n                    \r                              \n\nplaintiffs,  collectively,  as  \"Rhode  Island\"  or \"the  state.\"\nSimilarly,  we refer  to  the defendants,  collectively, as  \"the\nNarragansetts\" or \"the Tribe,\" noting, however, that  plaintiffs'\nsuit also names two tribal hierarchs as defendants.\n\n                                8\r\n\nover the settlement  lands by virtue of the  Settlement Act.

Proceeding on that assumption, the  court concluded\r             \n\nthat  any  such grant  was \"preempted\"  by  the Gaming  Act, and,\n\nconsequently, had  no enduring force  or effect.   Id.  Based  on\r                                                                \n\nthese  findings, the court ordered  the state to  enter into good\n\nfaith negotiations  to formulate a tribal-state compact.  See id.\r                                                                           \n\nat 806.\n\n          In  reaching   the  conclusion  that  the   Gaming  Act\n\ncontrolled,  the court  divided  its reasoning  into four  parts.\n\nFirst, it  cited with approval three precedents  holding that the\n\nGaming Act  overrode other  federal statutes of  earlier vintage.\n\nSee id. at  801-02.  Second, it found  the evidence of Congress's\r                 \n\nintent to place Rhode Island beyond the Gaming Act's sphere to be\n\nunpersuasive  in the absence  of textual support  in the statute.\n\nSee id. at 802-04.   Third, it dismissed the  suggestion that the\r                 \n\nGaming  Act could not trump the Settlement Act because the former\n\nwas the  more general of the  two statutory schemes.   See id. at\r                                                                        \n\n804.  Fourth,  it determined that the  Tribe \"ha[d] jurisdiction\"\n\nand \"exercise[d] governmental power\" over the settlement lands in\n\nsufficient measure to animate the Gaming Act.  See id. at 805-06.\r                                                                \n\n          After the  plaintiffs filed a timely  notice of appeal,\n\nthe district court stayed its order.5\n\nIV.

In a  separate\norder,  we  today dismiss  that  cross-appeal,  the Tribe  having\nfailed to present any developed argumentation in support thereof.\n\n                                9\r\n\n          The search for statutory  meaning inevitably reduces to\n\na pure question of law.

When a court interprets statutes that\n\ntouch on Indian sovereignty, general rules of construction apply,\n\nbut  they must be visualized from a distinctive perspective.  The\n\nCourt has described this coign of vantage:\n\n          The underlying premise is  that congressional\n          intent  will  control.   In  determining this\n          intent,  we  are  cautioned  to  follow  \"the\n          general rule that `[d]oubtful expressions are\n          to be resolved  in favor of [Indians]\". . . .\n          But  the  \"general rule\"  does not  command a\n          determination   .  .   .  in   the   face  of\n          congressionally  manifested   intent  to  the\n          contrary.   In  all cases,  \"the face  of the\n          Act,\"  the  \"surrounding circumstances,\"  and\n          the \"legislative history,\" are to be examined\n          with   an   eye   toward   determining   what\n          congressional intent was.\n\nRosebud  Sioux  Tribe  v.

We  propose, in the following  two parts, to\n\ndeal with the Settlement Act, for, if that statute did not confer\n\nstate jurisdiction  in  respect to  the settlement  lands, or  if\n\nstate  jurisdiction, once  conferred, vanished before  the Gaming\n\nAct  materialized,   then  the  state's  case  would  necessarily\n\nfounder.    To  this  end,  we discuss  in  Part  V  whether  the\n\njurisdictional inquiry is ripe; finding that it is, we discuss in\n\nPart VI the validity and scope  of the jurisdiction ceded to  the\n\nstate by the Settlement Act.\n\n          Next,  we must consider the Gaming  Act's effect on the\n\nstate's  jurisdiction.  In Part VII, we  deal with   and rebuff  \n\nthe  state's suggestion  that the  settlement lands  are entirely\n\nexempt from the  Gaming Act.   In Part VIII,  we deal with    and\n\nrebuff   the  state's argument  that, even  absent a  categorical\n\nexemption, the Tribe's relationship  to the settlement lands does\n\nnot possess  the attributes  needed to  trigger the  Gaming Act's\n\nprovisions.   The final curtain  falls at the  conclusion of Part\n\nIX, where  we confront the  interface between the  Settlement Act\n\nand  the Gaming Act, and test the district court's remedial order\n\nin the crucible of our understanding.\n\nV.

The test, as phrased in our cases, contains two parts:\n\n          First,  we consider whether  an issue  is fit\n          for  review,  e.g.,   whether  a   challenged\n          government  action  is   final  and   whether\n          determination of the merits turns  upon facts\n          which  may not yet be sufficiently developed.\n          Second, we consider the question of hardship,\n          a question which typically turns upon whether\n          the  challenged action  creates a  direct and\n          immediate dilemma for the parties.\n\nEl  Dia, 963 F.2d at  495 (citation and  internal quotation marks\r                 \n\nomitted); accord W.R.

In  a\n\ndeclaratory judgment  action adverseness  must be appraised  in a\n\npractical,  commonsense way.    Thus, satisfying  the adverseness\n\nrequirement  demands  that  \"the  facts alleged,  under  all  the\n\ncircumstances,  show  that  there is  a  substantial controversy,\n\nbetween  parties having  adverse legal  interests, of  sufficient\n\nimmediacy and reality  to warrant the  issuance of a  declaratory\n\njudgment.\"  Maryland Casualty Co. v.

We believe that this part of the inquiry should focus on\n\nthe  judgment's  usefulness.    Rather than  asking,  negatively,\n\nwhether denying relief would impose hardship, courts will do well\n\nto  ask, in a more  positive vein, whether  granting relief would\n\nserve  a useful purpose, or, put another way, whether the sought-\n\nafter declaration would be of practical assistance in setting the\n\nunderlying controversy to rest.  See Step-Saver, 912 F.2d at 647.\r                                                         \n\n          This  formulation is  hardly a  radical departure  from\n\nAbbott  Laboratories and  its progeny,  for the one  question may\r                              \n\nalways be transformed into the  other.  For example, to say  that\n\ndenying  relief is tolerable  where an adequate  state remedy has\n\n                                14\r\n\nbeen realized is tantamount to saying that granting the requested\n\nrelief in such a situation  would be pointless.  See El  Dia, 963\r                                                                      \n\nF.2d at 495.   Indeed, the Court some time  ago observed that one\n\nreason the  legal issues  must be  crystallized in a  declaratory\n\naction is to  enable the trial judge to see  \"some useful purpose\n\nto  be  achieved in  deciding them.\"    Public Service  Comm'n v.\r                                                                        \n\nWycoff Co., 344 U.S.  237, 244 (1952).  Furthermore,  framing the\r                    \n\nhardship  question in a  positive fashion best  comports with the\n\nspirit  of  the  Declaratory  Judgment  Act.

The court\r                                     \n\nseemed to focus  on the uncertainty of  the situation, suggesting\n\nthat the need for the relief requested depended on the occurrence\n\nof speculative events.

We\n\n                                15\r\n\nthink,  in fairness to the parties, that the former question must\n\nbe settled before they are ordered to commence negotiations for a\n\ntribal-state compact.  Because the required interpretation of the\n\nSettlement  Act projects a \"purely  legal\" issue, W.R.

And, moreover, while  it is true\n\nthat the compact negotiations may bear on the timing of class III\n\ngaming and  the  allocation of  regulatory responsibilities,  the\n\nnegotiations cannot  effect the existence  vel non  of state  and\r                                                            \n\nlocal jurisdiction.\n\n          The  impetus for  reaching the  merits  is strengthened\n\nbecause the  other characteristics traditionally  associated with\n\nripeness are also extant.   We have no serious  reservation about\n\nwhether  the proper parties are  before the court  or whether the\n\nrequested  ruling  will,  if  granted,  conclusively  define  the\n\nparties' baseline legal  rights.   By like token,  such a  ruling\n\nwould be of  great near-term utility, facilitating  the course of\n\nfuture tribal-state compact negotiations  and clarifying to  some\n\nextent the legal  status of the settlement  lands at a time  when\n\nsubstantially expanded  use seems highly probable.   Accordingly,\n\nwe  rule that  the basic  issue of  state and  local jurisdiction\n\n(although  not the specific,  fact-intensive permutations of that\n\nissue, see  infra Part  IX(C)) is ripe  for declaratory  judgment\r                           \n\n                                16\r\n\npurposes.\n\nVI.  STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTION\r          VI.  STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTION\n\n          Addressing  the  merits   of  this  issue  entails   an\n\nexamination of the validity and scope of the Settlement Act.  The\n\nAct  states that, with  two exceptions  not relevant  here,6 \"the\n\nsettlement  lands shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws\n\nand jurisdiction  of the  State of  Rhode Island.\"   25 U.S.C.   \n\n1708.  The  Tribe maintains that this pronouncement  was nugatory\n\nwhen made, or, if initially effective, was relegated to the scrap\n\nheap well before Congress enacted the Gaming Act.  The Tribe also\n\nmaintains  that,  validity  aside,  any  grant   of  jurisdiction\n\nexcludes civil  regulatory jurisdiction, and,  therefore, has  no\n\nbearing upon the proposed operation of a gambling casino.  We are\n\nnot persuaded.\n\n                          A.  Validity.\r                                    A.  Validity.\r                                                \n\n          The Tribe's basic position  is that, even prior  to the\n\nGaming Act, section 1708 of the Settlement Act did not constitute\n\na   valid  conferral  of   jurisdiction  because,  until  federal\n\nrecognition occurred in  1983, the Tribe  had no jurisdiction  to\n\nrelinquish.\n\n          This resupinate reasoning stands logic on its ear.  The\n\nTribe did not surrender jurisdiction in 1978.  Rather, the Tribe,\r                                 \n\nthe state,  and the town came to an agreement, spelled out in the\n\nJ-MEM, to ask Congress, among other things, to grant jurisdiction\n                    \r                              \n\n     6The exceptions relate to the Tribe's general exemption from\nstate taxation, 25 U.S.C.   1715(a), and its exemption from state\nregulations anent fishing and hunting, 25 U.S.C.   1706(a)(3).\n\n                                17\r\n\nto  the  state.    The  Tribe  has  articulated  no  reason  why,\n\nregardless  of its  legal status,  Congress lacked  the power  to\n\neffectuate this jurisdictional grant.\n\n          In any event,  the Tribe is  mistaken in its  professed\n\nbelief that it  lacked jurisdictional  power at the  time of  the\n\nSettlement Act.  Federal  recognition is just that:   recognition\n\nof a previously existing status.  The purpose of the procedure is\n\nto \"acknowledg[e] that certain American Indian tribes exist.\"  25\n\nC.F.R.   83.2 (1993).   The Tribe's retained sovereignty predates\n\nfederal  recognition    indeed,  it  predates  the birth  of  the\n\nRepublic, see Santa  Clara Pueblo  v. Martinez, 436  U.S. 49,  56\r                                                        \n\n(1978)    and it may be  altered only by an  act of Congress, see\r                                                                           \n\nMorton, 417 U.S. at 551-52.7 \r                \n\n          The Tribe  has two  other arrows in  its jurisdictional\n\nquiver.  First, it hypothesizes that section 1708 did not survive\n\nfederal  recognition.  This hypothesis is the mirror image of the\n\nhypothesis  just  considered:   rather  than  being  cast as  the\n\nprerequisite  for the conferral  of jurisdiction,  recognition is\n\ntaken  to  have nullified  that  conferral.   The  two hypotheses\n\nsuffer from the same infirmity.   Tribal sovereignty (and, hence,\n\njurisdiction)  may  be  neither augmented  nor  diminished except\n                    \r                              \n\n     7This  legal  principle  also  disposes  of  certain   other\narguments  raised by the  Tribe.   Thus, the  Tribe's sovereignty\ncould  not have  been eviscerated by  an act of  the Rhode Island\nGeneral  Assembly,  unratified  by  Congress, that  purported  to\nextinguish  tribal  status,  see  1879-1880  Acts,  Resolves  and\r                                                                           \nReports of the General Assembly of the State  of Rhode Island and\r                                                                           \nProvidence Plantations, Chap. 800, at 101-06, or by  the issuance\r                                \nof mere administrative  notices, see, e.g., 48 Fed.  Reg. 6177-78\r                                                    \n(Feb. 2, 1983).\n\n                                18\r\n\nthrough  congressional enactment.    Second,  the Tribe  suggests\n\nthat, if  section 1708 survived  recognition, it did  not survive\n\nthe  subsequent  alienation  of   the  settlement  lands.    This\n\nsuggestion goes nowhere.  Supposing that the jurisdictional grant\n\ncontained in  section  1708 could  have  been jettisoned  by  the\n\nstate, the  Tribe, or the Bureau without congressional sanction  \n\na supposition  we do  not  share    the fact  is  that, at  every\n\nsalient  moment, the parties  in interest took  pains to reaffirm\n\nsection  1708.8    We  conclude, therefore,  that  the  grant  of\n\njurisdiction contained in section 1708 of the Settlement Act  was\n\nvalid  when made, and was  undiluted at the  time Congress passed\n\nthe Gaming Act.\n\n                            B.  Scope.\r                                      B.  Scope.\r                                               \n\n          Validity  notwithstanding,  it  is  an   open  question\n\nwhether  the  jurisdictional  grant  contained  in  section  1708\n\nextends to civil regulatory jurisdiction.  The Tribe insists not.\n\nIt  tells  us that  the enacting  Congress  intended to  copy the\n\ndistinction  between  civil  regulatory  and  civil  adjudicatory\n\njurisdiction limned two years earlier in Bryan v. Itasca  County,\r                                                                          \n\n426 U.S.  373 (1976).  We  find this tale to  be both unsupported\n\nand unsupportable.\n\n          The Tribe's  argument runs  along the  following lines.\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     8The 1985  State Act amendments transferring  title from the\nholding  company to  the Tribe  contained a  provision for  state\njurisdiction substantially identical to that contained in section\n1708,  see 6A  R.I.  Gen.  Laws     37-18-13(b);  and  the  deeds\r                    \nconveying  the settlement lands from  the Tribe to  the Bureau in\n1988 explicitly confirmed the applicability of section 1708.\n\n                                19\r\n\nIn  its view,  there  are  salient  discrepancies in  respect  to\n\njurisdiction among the J-MEM, the original Senate bill leading to\n\nthe Settlement Act, and the final  version of the Act itself.  To\n\nillustrate the Tribe's point,  we list the three versions  of the\n\njurisdictional  clause  side  by  side,  in  order  of  drafting.\n\nAccording  to three  documents, the  settlement lands were  to be\n\nsubject to:\n\n          All laws of the state . . . including but not\n          limited to state and local building, fire and\n          safety codes [J-MEM,   13];\n\n          the complete civil and  criminal jurisdiction\n          of the State. . . .  [Joint Hearing on S.3153\n          and H.R. 12860, 95th  Cong., 2d Sess., at 36,\n          51 (June 20, 1978)];\n\n          the civil and criminal laws  and jurisdiction\n          of the State. . . . [18 U.S.C.   1708].\n\nAnalogizing  to Bryan,  the  Tribe posits  that this  progression\r                               \n\nsignals Congress's intent to limit the jurisdictional grant.\n\n          This  proposed interpretation  finds no  succor in  the\n\nlegislative  history.   Without  such  support,  we  think it  is\n\nevident that  the Narragansetts  read too  much into  too little.\n\nConsidering the overall context, the deviations from one document\n\nto  another  do not  strike us  as  especially significant.   The\n\nprogressive development of the  jurisdictional language can  more\n\nplausibly be interpreted  as intended to  clarify the breadth  of\n\nthe grant, rather than to narrow it.  Perhaps the drafters feared\n\nthat   \"all  laws   of  the   state\"  might   suggest  regulatory\n\njurisdiction  alone, and that  \"civil and  criminal jurisdiction\"\n\nmight  imply only jurisdiction in the judicial sense.  \"Civil and\n\n                                20\r\n\ncriminal laws and jurisdiction\" more obviously includes all sorts\n\nof jurisdiction, and can  fairly lay claim to being  the broadest\n\nof the three formulations.\n\n          The only change arguably suggesting a diminution in the\n\nscope  of jurisdiction is the removal of the word \"complete\" from\n\nthe draft version  of the bill.  We think  that this change, too,\n\nmay  be  understood as  an attempt  at  clarification:   the word\n\n\"complete\" could  well  have been  removed  simply to  avoid  any\n\nsuggestion  that the  grant of  jurisdiction was  intended to  be\n\nexclusive.  Cf.  United States v. Cook,  922 F.2d 1026,  1032 (2d\r                                                \n\nCir.) (suggesting  that  \"exclusive jurisdiction\"  and  \"complete\n\njurisdiction\" may  have the same connotation),  cert. denied, 111\r                                                                      \n\nS. Ct. 2235 (1991).   For that reason, the discrepant language is\n\nat best inconclusive.\n\n          The  small changes  in  phraseology  pinpointed by  the\n\nTribe, floated without visible means of  support, place this case\n\nat  considerable remove  from Bryan,  a case  in which  the Court\r                                             \n\nconfronted  a  genuinely   suggestive  lingual  discrepancy,  and\n\ninterpreted the final version of the statute in line with clearly\n\narticulated legislative history.  See  Bryan, 426 U.S. at 379-87.\r                                                      \n\nHere, by contrast, the discrepancies that the Tribe perceives are\n\nmore conjectural than suggestive;  there is absolutely nothing in\n\nthe  legislative history  of  the Settlement  Act that  indicates\n\ncongressional  intent   either  to  limit  the   scope  of  state\n\njurisdiction or to carve a jurisdictional distinction along civil\n\n                                21\r\n\nregulatory/civil adjudicatory lines.9  Thus, Bryan is not a  fair\r                                                            \n\ncongener.\n\n          Our assessment is reinforced  by a commonsense tenet of\n\nstatutory construction.  Relatively minor differences  between an\n\nIndian agreement and the ratifying act of Congress needed to give\n\nit effect,  without more, do  not give rise to  an inference that\n\nCongress intended to  modify the agreement.   See Rosebud  Sioux,\r                                                                          \n\n430 U.S.  at 599 (holding  that a  1904 act of  Congress did  not\n\nmodify a 1901 Indian agreement, despite a suggestive minor change\n\nin language).  At  least when an \"implied continuity  in purpose\"\n\nexists between  the  antecedent agreement  and  the  subsequently\n\nenacted statute, courts should  construe the latter to effectuate\n\nthe  former, notwithstanding  differing linguistic choices.   Id.\r                                                                           \n\nSo it is here, for  the Settlement Act was designed to  implement\n\nthe  agreement embodied  in the  J-MEM.  See,  e.g., 25  U.S.C.  \r                                                             \n\n1701(d)   (declaring  that   the  J-MEM   \"requires  implementing\n\nlegislation\");  Joint  Hearing  at  97 (acknowledging  that  \"the\n\nlegislation  as  drafted  intends  to  implement  the  settlement\n\nagreement\")  (statement of  Alan  R. Parker,  Gen. Counsel,  Sen.\n\nSelect Comm. on Indian Affairs).\n\n          We  need not  belabor  the obvious.    Since the  self-\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     9We  do  not  believe the  Tribe's  cause  is  aided by  the\nBureau's tentative  expression of  support for the  position that\nsection  1708  excludes  civil  regulatory   jurisdiction.    See\r                                                                           \nSoutheast  Regional Solicitor's  Memorandum Opinion    (April 30,\n1992).  The Bureau's views are not entitled to any special weight\nin  the interpretation  of  statutory provisions  that it  is not\ncharged  to execute.  See Crandon v. United States, 494 U.S. 152,\r                                                            \n177 (1990).\n\n                                22\r\n\nserving inference drawn by the Tribe is plainly at odds with  the\n\ndiscernible intention  undergirding the  Settlement Act,  and, in\n\nthe  bargain, plays  havoc  with the  statutory text,  we decline\n\ngratuitously  to  limit the  scope of  section  1708 in  order to\n\nparallel  the holding in Bryan.10   Cf. United  States v. Dakota,\r                                                                          \n\n796  F.2d  186, 188  (6th Cir.  1986)  (refusing to  extend Bryan\r                                                                           \n\ndistinction  to  18   U.S.C.      1955,  because   it  would   be\n\ninappropriate to apply  a test \"developed in a  different context\n\nto address  different concerns\").

But  delegated powers,\r                  \n\nof  necessity, cannot  exceed those  possessed by  the delegator.\n\nThe  town  has cited  no independent  basis  upon which  it might\r                                              \n\nexercise  municipal jurisdiction,  and  none is  apparent to  us.\n\nThus,  Charlestown's  concerns are  necessarily  subsumed in  our\n\ndiscussion of the state's jurisdiction.\n\nVII.  THE REACH OF THE GAMING ACT\r          VII.  THE REACH OF THE GAMING ACT\n\n          Before addressing the Tribe's  ultimate argument   that\n\nthe Gaming  Act cancels whatever jurisdiction  the Settlement Act\n\ngranted    we  must first  consider both  furcula of  the state's\n\nassertion  that the  settlement  lands are  specifically exempted\n\nfrom the Gaming Act's domain.\n\n              A.  The Consensual Transfer Provision.\r                        A.  The Consensual Transfer Provision.\r                                                             \n\n          The  Gaming  Act's   so-called  \"consensual   transfer\"\n\nprovision,  familiarly known as  \"section 23(d),\" is  the site of\n\nthe next battle.  It states in relevant part:\n\n          The  United  States   shall  have   exclusive\n          jurisdiction  over  criminal prosecutions  of\n          violations  of State  gambling laws  that are\n          made  applicable under this section to Indian\n\n                                24\r\n\n          country, unless an Indian tribe pursuant to a\n          Tribal-State compact . . . or under any other\n          provision  of Federal  law, has  consented to\n          the  transfer  to   the  State  of   criminal\n          jurisdiction with respect  to gambling on the\n          lands of the Indian tribe.\n\n18 U.S.C.    1166(d).   This  proviso, Rhode  Island asseverates,\n\npresages  an exemption  applicable to the  settlement lands.   On\n\nthis  theory, section  23(d) allows  a state  lawfully to  assert\n\ncivil  and  criminal  jurisdiction  over gaming  under  either  a\r                                                                        \n\ntribal-state compact or \"any other provision of Federal law\" that\r                                 \n\nembodies a consensual transfer of jurisdiction.   And it portrays\n\nsection 1708 of the Settlement Act as constituting such an agreed\n\ntransfer.\n\n          This interpretation signifies  a promiscuous  elevation\n\nof hope over reason, for  it completely overlooks two limitations\n\nthat are apparent  on the face  of the statute.   First,  section\n\n23(d) is a penal provision that in terms deals only with criminal\n\nprosecutions; it  has  no  implications  for  civil  jurisdiction\n\n(whether  regulatory  or  adjudicatory).   Second,  section 23(d)\n\npertains  only to \"gambling,\"  which is  defined for  purposes of\n\nthat section as excluding any kind  of \"gaming.\"  See 18 U.S.C.  \r                                                               \n\n1166(c).  Thus, properly  understood, section 23(d) allows states\n\nto exercise  jurisdiction pursuant to a  consensual transfer only\n\nto  enforce  criminal  laws  that  proscribe  gambling activities\n\nfalling  outside the sanctuary of the Gaming  Act.  This is of no\n\nassistance  to Rhode  Island,  which seeks  to assert  unfettered\n\njurisdiction  (including  civil  regulatory   jurisdiction)  over\n\n                                25\r\n\nactivities constituting class II and class III gaming.12\n\n             B.  Decrypting the Legislative History.\r                       B.  Decrypting the Legislative History.\r                                                             \n\n          Next, the state attempts  a flanking maneuver.  Without\n\nmeaningful citation to the Gaming Act's text, the state hawks the\n\nproposition that Congress, in passing the Act,  intended to leave\n\nintact the grant of jurisdiction tendered a decade earlier in the\n\nSettlement Act.  And to fill the forensic void left  by the utter\n\nabsence of  any  statutory language  to  this effect,  the  state\n\npushes  forward   carefully  selected  snippets   of  legislative\n\nhistory.  There are two significant problems with this approach.\n\n          In  the  first place,  courts  must  look primarily  to\n\nstatutory language,  not to legislative  history, in  determining\n\nthe meaning and scope of a statute.  See, e.g.,  United States v.\r                                                                        \n\nTurkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580 (1981); Consumer  Prod.

In  a case such  as this  one, an  inquiring court, at\n\nmost,  should resort  to  legislative history  only to  determine\n\n\"whether  there is  a  `clearly expressed  legislative intention'\n\ncontrary to  [the statutory]  language, which would  require [the\n\ncourt] to question the strong presumption that Congress expresses\n\nits intent through  the language  it chooses.\"   INS v.

After  careful  consideration of  Rhode Island's\n\nextratextual arguments, we conclude  that the material it musters\n\nfails  to   establish  such  a   clearly  expressed   legislative\n\nintention.\n\n          The  state begins this phase of its case by pointing to\n\na  preliminary  version  of  the  Gaming  Act  that  contained  a\n\nprovision  (former section  23) safeguarding  the Settlement  Act\n\nfrom  implied repeal.13    Once that  foundation  is poured,  the\n                    \r                              \n\n     13In the original bill, former section 23 read as follows:\n\n          Nothing  in  this  Act may  be  construed  as\n\n                                27\r\n\nstate then brings to the forefront a colloquy on the floor of the\n\nSenate involving  Rhode Island's  two senators, Messrs.  Pell and\n\nChafee, and Senator Inouye, sponsor and floor manager of the bill\n\nthat became the  Gaming Act, regarding  the eventual deletion  of\n\nformer section 23 from the bill:\n\n          Mr.  PELL.   Mr. President,  I would  like to\n          thank  the  managers  of  S.555,  the  Indian\n          Gaming Regulatory Act,  and particularly  the\n          chairman  of the  Select Committee  on Indian\n          Affairs [Mr. Inouye], for their hard work and\n          patience  in  achieving a  consensus  on this\n          important measure.\n\n          In the interests  of clarity,14 I have  asked\n          that   language   specifically   citing   the\n          protections  of  the   Rhode  Island   Claims\n          Settlement   Act   (Public  Law   95-395)  be\n          stricken from S.555.  I understand that these\n          protections clearly will remain in effect.\n\n          Mr.    INOUYE.   I  thank  my colleague,  the\n          senior Senator from Rhode Island  [Mr. Pell],\n          and  assure him that  the protections  of the\n          Rhode Island Claims  Settlement Act (P.L. 95-\n          395),  will remain  in  effect and  that  the\n          Narragansett Indian Tribe clearly will remain\n          subject   to   the   civil,   criminal,   and\n          regulatory laws of the State of Rhode Island.\n\n                    \r                              \n\n          permitting gaming activities,  except to  the\n          extent permitted under the  laws of the State\n          of Rhode  Island, on  lands  acquired by  the\n          Narragansett  Indian  Tribe  under the  Rhode\n          Island Indian Claims Settlement Act or on any\n          lands held by, or on behalf of, such Tribe.\n\n134 Cong.

In the  game of\n\nstatutory  interpretation, statutory  language  is  the  ultimate\n\ntrump  card.     Consequently,  the  overarching   rule  is  that\n\n\"statements  by  individual  legislators  should  not  be   given\n\ncontrolling effect\"; rather, such  statements are to be respected\n\nonly to the extent  that they \"are consistent with  the statutory\n\nlanguage.\"  Brock v.

Cf., e.g., Hirschey  v. FERC, 777 F.2d 1,  7-9 &amp;\r                                                       \n\nn.1  (D.C. Cir.  1985) (Scalia,  J., concurring)  (observing that\n\nmembers  of  Congress  cannot  be held  accountable  for  lacking\n\nknowledge  of  minute  details  in  committee  reports).    It is\n\nparticularly unrealistic  to  attribute knowledge  of  statements\n\nmade on the Senate floor to House members, who gave their seal of\n\napproval to the Senate bill only after the Rhode Island exemption\n\nprovision  had been  deleted, without  mentioning  Rhode Island's\n\nparochial  concern.  See 134  Cong. Rec. H8146,  H8426 (daily ed.\r                                  \n\nSept.  27,   1988)  (commemorating   passage  by  the   House  of\n\nRepresentatives).  For much the same reason, it is unrealistic to\n\nattribute such knowledge to the President.\n\n          In our republican form of government, legislators  make\n\nlaws  by writing  statutes    an exercise  that requires  putting\n\nwords  on paper  in  a way  that  conveys a  reasonably  definite\n\nmeaning.   Once Congress has spoken,  it is bound by  what it has\n\nplainly  said, notwithstanding the  nods and winks  that may have\n\nbeen exchanged  in floor debates  and committee hearings.   After\n\nall,  it is not  the proper role of  legislators to use unwritten\n\nassurances or  side arrangements  to alter the  clear meaning  of\n\n                                31\r\n\nagreed  language.  And the  judiciary must stand  as the ultimate\n\nguarantor of the integrity of an enacted statute's text.\n\n          In  sum,  once  Congress  has spoken,  a  court  cannot\n\noverride  the  unambiguous  words   of  an  enacted  statute  and\n\nsubstitute  for  them  the   court's  views  of  what  individual\n\nlegislators likely intended.   Any other rule imports a  virulent\n\nstrain of subjectivity  into the  interpretive task  and, in  the\n\nprocess, threatens to  transfer too large a slice  of legislative\n\npower from Congress to the courts.  See Frankfurter, supra, at 60\r                                                                    \n\n(warning that courts  should not be \"led  off the trail  by tests\n\nthat have overtones of subjective design\").\n\n          Here, the  colloquy upon which  the state relies  is an\n\nespecially  slender  reed because  it  offers  an explanation  of\n\nCongress's  action that  defies  a widely  accepted principle  of\n\nstatutory construction.  When Congress includes limiting language\n\nin an early  version of proposed  legislation, and then  rewrites\n\nthe bill  prior to enactment  so as to scrap  the limitation, the\n\nstandard  presumption is  that Congress  intended the  proviso to\n\noperate  without limitation.

Congress  could have\navoided  such ambiguity  in a  myriad of  ways short  of striking\nformer section 23, say, by substituting a generic exemption for a\n\n                                32\r\n\nCongress simply had a change of heart.\n\n          In  this case, there is no \"more.\"   The state tries to\n\nbuttress its argument by  touting a comment in the  Senate report\n\nto  the effect \"that nothing  in the [Gaming  Act] will supersede\n\nany specific  restriction or specific grant  of Federal authority\n\nor  jurisdiction to a State  which may be  encompassed in another\n\nFederal statute, including the Rhode Island Claims Settlement Act\n\n[and the Maine] Indian Claims Settlement Act.\"  1988 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\nat  3082 (citations  omitted).   But  this  patch of  legislative\n\nhistory is also threadbare.  The Senate report speaks only to the\n\nbill as reported  out of  committee; it was  composed before  the\r                                                                      \n\ndeletion of the special  Rhode Island exemption provision, former\n\nsection  23,  from the  final version  of  the bill  during floor\n\ndebate.   Thus, the quoted statement sheds no light on Congress's\n\nintent regarding the law it actually enacted.17\n                    \r                              \n\ncategory of  states including Rhode  Island, or  by citing  Rhode\nIsland in a non-exhaustive list of states that would be exempted.\nTo  accept the suggested rationale  would be to  indulge in sheer\nspeculation.\n\n     17We sympathize with the predicament in which Rhode Island's\nsenators  found themselves    being asked to  take the  word of a\npowerful committee chariman   but sympathy alone cannot carry the\nday.   Our dissenting  brother puts  the  very best  face on  the\nstate's  argument, yet  the dissent,  though  gracefully written,\ncontains  nothing to  shake our  view  of either  the controlling\nlegal  principles or  the legislative  history.   While  we plead\nguilty to  the charge of  literalism, placing strong  emphasis on\nthe statutory text is a court's proper function.  See, e.g.,  GTE\r                                                                           \nSylvania,  447 U.S.  at  108 (declaring  that statutory  language\r                  \n\"must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive\"); Caminetti v.

DOES THE GAMING ACT APPLY?\r          VIII.  DOES THE GAMING ACT APPLY?\n\n          Our odyssey is not  yet finished, as the state  and the\n\namici construct a plausible textual argument as an amulet to ward\n\noff  the Gaming  Act.   This  argument  stems from  the  language\n\nlimiting the applicability of the Gaming Act's  key provisions to\n\n\"[a]ny Indian  tribe having jurisdiction over  Indian lands,\" or,\n\nstated  differently,  to  \"Indian   lands  within  such   tribe's\n\njurisdiction.\"    See  25 U.S.C.      2710(d)(3)(A),  2710(b)(1).\r                               \n\nThese  are dual limitations, for one element of the definition of\n\n\"Indian  lands\"  requires   that  an  Indian  tribe   \"exercise[]\n\ngovernmental  power\"  over them.   25  U.S.C.    2703(4).   Rhode\n\nIsland claims that the Narragansetts do not \"hav[e] jurisdiction\"\n\nover,  and do not exercise  \"governmental power\" with respect to,\n\nthe settlement lands;  and, thus,  that the Gaming  Act does  not\n\npertain.   Evaluating the state's thesis  requires an exploration\n\ninto another aspect of congressional intent.\n\n                     A.  Having Jurisdiction.\r                               A.  Having Jurisdiction.\r                                                      \n\n          In the state's view, the phrase  \"having jurisdiction,\"\n\nas used in the Gaming Act,  must, insofar as the settlement lands\n\nare  concerned, be  gauged in light  of the  Settlement Act.   We\n\n                    \r                              \n\nbased  theories   of  statutory  interpretation,  such   as  that\nunderpinning  Watts v. Alaska, 451  U.S. 259 (1981).   We believe\r                                       \nthat  our  result  is  compelled   by  any  acceptable  mode   of\ninterpretation.\n          Finally, although we share Judge  Coffin's reticence to\ndiscredit responsible floor exchanges, we fail to see how a floor\nexchange utterly at odds with the words of an enacted statute can\nbe given  primacy in the  interpretive process.   If  legislative\nbodies  desire to  accomplish particular  results, they  must use\ntheir tools with greater care.\n\n                                34\r\n\nagree.  But the mere fact that the Settlement Act  cedes power to\n\nthe state  does not necessarily  mean, as Rhode  Island suggests,\n\nthat   the   Tribe  lacks   similar   power   and,  thus,   lacks\n\n\"jurisdiction\" over the  settlement lands.  Although the grant of\n\njurisdictional  power to the state in the Settlement Act is valid\n\nand rather  broad, see supra  Parts V(B), VI,  we do  not believe\r                                      \n\nthat it  is exclusive.  To  the contrary, we rule  that the Tribe\n\nretains  concurrent jurisdiction  over the  settlement lands  and\n\nthat such  concurrent jurisdiction  is sufficient to  satisfy the\n\ncorresponding precondition to applicability of the Gaming Act.\n\n          In undertaking  the  task of  determining  whether  the\n\nSettlement Act's jurisdictional grant  is exclusive in nature, it\n\nmust be remembered that Indian sovereignty is \"a backdrop against\n\nwhich  the applicable  .  . .  federal  statutes must  be  read.\"\n\nMcClanahan v. State Tax  Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164, 172  (1973).  This\r                                         \n\nbackdrop is a  necessary adjunct  to the  search for  legislative\n\nintent  in the context of Indian-related legislation.  See Cotton\r                                                                           \n\nPetroleum  Corp.  v.

As  the\r                                    \n\nSupreme Court  has explained, \"Indian tribes  still possess those\n\naspects  of sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or statute, or by\n\nimplication  as a  necessary result  of their  dependent status.\"\n\nId.; accord Bottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe, 599 F.2d 1061, 1065-\r                                                     \n\n66 (1st Cir. 1979).\n\n          We believe  that jurisdiction is an  integral aspect of\n\nretained  sovereignty.    After  all,  the  Court  has  held that\n\nretained sovereignty  includes the power  of Indians to  make and\n\nenforce their own substantive  law in internal matters, including\n\nmatters  such as  membership  rules, inheritance  rules, and  the\n\nregulation  of domestic relations.   See Santa  Clara Pueblo, 436\r                                                                      \n\nU.S. at  56 (citing cases).   Jurisdiction is  cut from much  the\n\nsame fabric.\n\n          Of course, the shape  of retained sovereignty has never\n\nbeen precisely defined.   Thus, it cannot be said  with assurance\n\nwhether or not criminal, civil adjudicatory, and civil regulatory\n\njurisdiction,   in   whole  cloth,   are   aspects  of   retained\n\nsovereignty.   But we  have no need  today to map  such far-flung\n\nfrontiers.    For present  purposes, so  long  as the  portion of\n\njurisdiction  encompassed  within  the   natural  rights  of  the\n\nNarragansetts is  substantial enough to satisfy  the Gaming Act's\n\n\"having jurisdiction\" prong, our inquiry is satisfied.\n\n          The state  has not  contended that any  treaty impinges\n\n                                36\r\n\nupon  the Tribe's jurisdiction.   By like token,  the record will\n\nnot support a  finding of jurisdiction abandoned  or lost through\n\nimplicit divestiture, see Wheeler, 435 U.S. at 326.  We are left,\r                                           \n\nthen,  with  the  relatively  confined question  of  whether  the\n\nTribe's retained jurisdiction has been forfeited by  statute.  It\n\nis against this backdrop that we focus the lens of our inquiry on\n\nthe Settlement Act.\n\n          2.  The Settlement  Act.  By its terms,  the Settlement\r                    2.  The Settlement  Act.\r                                           \n\nAct purposes to do no more than grant jurisdiction to  the state;\n\nit does  not expressly strip the Tribe  of jurisdiction, transfer\n\njurisdiction from  the Tribe to  the state, or  employ suggestive\n\nadjectives  like  \"exclusive\"  or  \"complete\"  in  describing the\n\njurisdictional grant.  The omission of the word \"exclusive\" looms\n\nparticularly  large in light of  the use of  that word elsewhere.\n\nFor   instance,  the   word  is   used  to  modify   the  general\n\njurisdictional grant in  18 U.S.C.   1162 (1988), one  of the few\n\nanalogous statutes  granting  \"civil and  criminal  jurisdiction\"\n\nover Indian lands to  an individual state.  Even  more tellingly,\n\nthe   word  is   used  in  the   Settlement  Act   itself,  which\n\ncharacterizes  as  \"exclusive\" the  grant  to  federal courts  of\n\njurisdiction to  entertain certain constitutional challenges.  25\n\nU.S.C.   1711.   This phenomenon  commands our utmost  attention,\n\nfor where  \"Congress includes particular language  in one section\n\nof a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act,  it\n\nis  generally  presumed  that  Congress  acts  intentionally  and\n\npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\"  Rodriguez v.\r                                                                        \n\n                                37\r\n\nUnited States, 480 U.S. 522, 525 (1987) (citations omitted).\r                       \n\n          We are not alone in our reluctance to infer exclusivity\n\nabsent some suggestion to that effect in the  statutory text.  At\n\nleast one  other court has  found the omission  of words such  as\n\n\"exclusive\" or \"complete\" in a similar context  to be meaningful.\n\nSee Cook, 922 F.2d at 1026, 1032-33 (concluding from the omission\r                  \n\nof  any such  language that a  grant to New  York of jurisdiction\n\noverIndian lands, embodied in 25 U.S.C.   232, is non-exclusive).\n\n          Comparative analysis is also  instructive.  We think it\n\nis sensible  to compare the jurisdictional grant  embedded in the\n\nSettlement  Act with  the  jurisdictional grants  encased in  two\n\nother  Indian claims  settlement  acts that  were to  some extent\n\nmodeled  after the Settlement Act.  Both  of the latter pieces of\n\nlegislation   one involving  Massachusetts, one involving Maine  \n\ncontain  grants   of  jurisdiction  parallel  to   section  1708,\n\nexpressed in similar language.  See  25 U.S.C.   1771g (1988); 25\r                                             \n\nU.S.C.   1725 (1988).   Yet both acts also  contain corresponding\n\nlimits on  Indian  jurisdiction, conspicuously  absent  from  the\n\nSettlement Act.   See 25 U.S.C.   1771e(a); 25  U.S.C.   1725(f).\r                               \n\nBy  placing stated  limits on  the retained  jurisdiction of  the\n\naffected  tribes, these newer acts imply  that an unadorned grant\n\nof  jurisdiction  to  a  state     such as  is  embodied  in  the\n\nSettlement Act   does not in and of itself imply exclusivity.\n\n          We find these factors  to be of decretory significance.\n\nGiven the strong congressional bias, especially noticeable in the\n\npast  generation,  against  policies  that  would  promote Indian\n\n                                38\r\n\nassimilation,  see Bryan,  426 U.S.  at 387-88  &amp; n.14,  and also\r                                  \n\ngiven  Congress's  fortunate  penchant  for  great  clarity  when\n\nexpressing its intent  in this  area, see id.  at 389  (\"Congress\r                                                       \n\nkn[ows]  well how to express its intent directly when that intent\n\n[is] to subject . . .

So  here.   Since  the\n\nSettlement  Act does  not unequivocally  articulate an  intent to\n\ndeprive  the Tribe  of jurisdiction,  we hold  that its  grant of\n\njurisdiction to  the state is non-exclusive.   The Narragansetts,\n\ntherefore,  have  made the  necessary  threshold  showing.

Consequently, an  inquiring\n\ncourt  must assay  the jurisdictional  history of  the settlement\n\n                                39\r\n\nlands.18    Cf., e.g.,  DeCoteau  v.

It  has  established a\n\nhousing authority,  recognized as eligible to  participate in the\n\nIndian programs of  the federal Department  of Housing and  Urban\n\nDevelopment, see 24  C.F.R., Part  905 (1993).   It has  obtained\r                          \n\nstatus  as the functional equivalent  of a state  for purposes of\n\nthe   Clean  Water   Act,  after  having   been  deemed   by  the\n\nEnvironmental  Protection  Agency  as  having  \"a governing  body\n\ncarrying  out substantial  governmental  duties and  powers,\"  33\n\nU.S.C.   1377(e) (1988), and as being capable of administering an\n\neffective program of water regulation,  see 40 C.F.R.    130.6(d)\r                                                     \n\n(1993).   It has taken considerable advantage of the Indian Self-\n\nDetermination  and Education  Assistance  Act  (ISDA), a  statute\n\nspecifically  designed to  help build  \"strong and  stable tribal\n\ngovernments.\"    25  U.S.C.      450(a)(b)  (1988).    The  Tribe\n\nadministers health  care programs  under  an ISDA  pact with  the\n\nIndian Health Service, and, under ISDA contracts with the Bureau,\n\nadministers  programs  encompassing   job  training,   education,\n\ncommunity  services, social  services,  real  estate  protection,\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     18An historical perspective is  also relevant to the \"having\njurisdiction\"   inquiry.      A   \"longstanding   assumption   of\njurisdiction   .  .   .  not   only  demonstrates   the  parties'\nunderstanding  of  the  meaning  of  the  Act,  but  has  created\njustifiable  expectations  which should  not be  upset  . .  . .\"\nRosebud Sioux, 430 U.S. at 604-05.\r                       \n\n                                40\r\n\nconservation,  public safety,  and  the like.

THE INTERFACE\r          IX.  THE INTERFACE\n\n          Because  we have  concluded that the  settlement lands,\n\nunder the Tribe's auspices, meet both prerequisites of the Gaming\n\nAct, those lands are  subject to the Act's benefits  and burdens.\n\nThe task remaining  is to determine  how the Gaming  Act and  the\n\nSettlement Act operate in tandem.\n\n             A.

Supp.  at 804.  The doctrine of preemption is derived from the\n\nSupremacy  Clause, U.S.  Const.,  Art VI,  cl.  2, and  therefore\n\napplies  only to  conflicts  between federal  provisions, on  one\n\nhand, and  state or local  provisions, on  the other  hand.   See\r                                                                           \n\nCipollone v.  Liggett Group, 112 S.  Ct. 2608, 2617  (1992).  The\r                                     \n\nproper  mode  of analysis  for cases  that   involve  a perceived\n\nconflict between two federal statutes  is that of implied repeal.\n\nSee  Cook, 922  F.2d  at 1033  (rejecting preemption  analysis as\r                   \n\ninappropriate in resolving  a conflict between the Gaming Act and\n\nan  earlier  federal  statute);  see also  1A  Norman  J.

Hence,  we\r                                     \n\nfollow that analytic path.\n\n          We  start by  reiterating  the bedrock  principle  that\n\n                                41\r\n\nimplied  repeals  of federal  statutes  are disfavored.    In the\n\nabsence  of a  contrary  legislative command,  when  two acts  of\n\nCongress touch  upon the same  subject matter  the courts  should\n\ngive  effect to both, if that is feasible.  See Pipefitters Local\r                                                                           \n\n562  v.

In other\r                          \n\nwords, so long as the two statutes, fairly construed, are capable\n\nof  coexistence, courts  should regard  each  as effective.   See\r                                                                           \n\nTraynor  v. Turnage, 485 U.S.  535, 547-48 (1988).

We\r                                             \ncaution,  however, that  while Brien  suggests that  statutes may\r                                              \nnever be impliedly repealed in part, see  id. at 309, more recent\r                                                       \ncases clarify the point,  see, e.g., Bristol Energy Corp.  v.

The rule is that, generally, there can be no\npartial implied repeal absent repugnancy.  This is simply another\r                                                  \nway of  stating that congressional  intent to substitute  a later\nact  for an earlier  one will ordinarily  be implied  only if the\nlater act usurps  the whole ground  occupied by the  first.   See\r                                                                           \nPosadas,  296 U.S. at 504.  If repugnancy is found, however, then\r                 \na partial repeal  is in most cases preferred   indeed, mandated  \n\n                                42\r\n\n          The doctrine of implied repeal operates without special\n\nembellishment in  the Indian law  context.  See,  e.g., Blackfeet\r                                                                           \n\nIndian  Tribe  v.

The  rationale for\r                              \n\nencouraging preemption in the Indian  context   that the  federal\n\ngovernment  is a  more trustworthy  guardian of  Indian interests\n\nthan the  states    has no  relevance to a  conflict between  two\n\nfederal statutes.\n\n                   B.  Applying the Principles.\r                             B.  Applying the Principles.\r                                                        \n\n          It is evident  that the Settlement  Act and the  Gaming\n\nAct are partially but  not wholly repugnant.  The  Settlement Act\n\nassigned the state a number of  rights.  Among those rights   and\n\nby  no  means  one   of  the  rights  at  the  epicenter  of  the\n\nnegotiations  leading up to the Act   was the non-exclusive right\n\nto exercise jurisdiction, in all customary respects save two, see\r                                                                           \n\nsupra note 6,  over the settlement lands.  The  Gaming Act leaves\r               \n\nundisturbed  the key elements  of the compromise  embodied in the\n\nSettlement  Act.   It  also leaves  largely  intact the  grant of\n\njurisdiction    but it demands  an adjustment of  that portion of\n\njurisdiction touching on gaming.  \n\n          Even in  respect to  jurisdiction over gaming,  the two\n\nlaws do not collide head-on.  Thus,  in connection with class III\n\ngaming,  the Gaming  Act does  not in  itself negate  the state's\n\njurisdiction,  but, instead,  channels  the state's  jurisdiction\n\n                    \r                              \n\nfor  only that  part  of the  earlier  statute which  is  plainly\nanathematic should be nullified.\n\n                                43\r\n\nthrough the tribal-state compact process.  It is only with regard\n\nto  class I and  class II gaming  that the Gaming  Act ex proprio\r                                                                           \n\nvigore  bestows exclusive  jurisdiction  on qualifying  tribes.20\r                \n\nAnd it  is  only  to these  small  degrees that  the  Gaming  Act\n\nproperly  may  be  said  to  have  worked  a  partial  repeal  by\n\nimplication of the preexisting statute.\n\n          In the area in which the two laws clash, the Gaming Act\n\ntrumps  the Settlement Act for  two reasons.   First, the general\n\nrule is that where  two acts are in irreconcilable  conflict, the\n\nlater  act prevails to the extent of  the impasse.21  See Watt v.\r                                                                        \n\nAlaska, 451 U.S. 259,  266 (1981); Tynen, 78 U.S. (11.

Const.,  supra,  \r                                                                        \n\n51.02,  at  121.   Second,  in  keeping  with the  spirit  of the\n\nstandards governing  implied repeals,  courts should endeavor  to\n\nread  antagonistic  statutes together  in  the  manner that  will\n\nminimize the aggregate disruption of congressional intent.  Here,\n\nreading  the two  statutes  to restrict  state jurisdiction  over\n\ngaming honors  the Gaming Act and,  at the same  time, leaves the\n                    \r                              \n\n     20We take no view on  whether, apart from the Gaming Act,  a\nstate might have  regulated the activities that  comprise class I\ngaming without violating the Free Exercise Clause.\n\n     21The state  argues that  the Settlement Act  should prevail\nbecause it is the more specific statute.  There are two cracks in\nthis palladium.   As noted  by the  court below,  it is  arguable\nwhich  statute is the more specific.  See Narragansett Tribe, 816\r                                                                      \nF. Supp.  at 804.  More  fundamentally, the canon  upon which the\nstate relies is rooted in the presumption that, when legislatures\nenact  general laws, they do  not have in  mind every preexisting\nstatute  that  touches on  some  specific aspect  of  the general\nsubject.   Where, as here, the  enacting Congress is demonstrably\naware of  the  earlier  law  at  the  time  of  the  later  law's\nenactment, there is no basis for indulging the presumption. \n\n                                44\r\n\nheart  of the Settlement Act untouched.  Taking the opposite tack\n\n  reading  the two statutes  in such  a way as  to defeat  tribal\n\njurisdiction over  gaming on the  settlement lands    would honor\n\nthe  Settlement Act, but would do great violence to the essential\n\nstructure  and purpose  of the  Gaming Act.   Because  the former\n\ncourse  keeps  disruption  of  congressional  intent  to  a  bare\n\nminimum, that reading is to be preferred.\n\n          Based on our understanding  of the statutory interface,\n\nwe hold that the  provisions of the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act\n\napply with  full force to the  lands in Rhode Island  now held in\n\ntrust by the United States for the Narragansett Indian Tribe.22\n\n                  C.

While the Tribe  retains\n\nall aspects of its retained sovereignty, as that term is commonly\n\ncomprehended in our jurisprudence, Congress, after having granted\n\nto the state non-exclusive jurisdiction over the settlement lands\n\nvia the  Settlement Act, impliedly withdrew from  that grant, via\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     22We  decline  to   address  certain  constitutional  claims\nadvanced  by the amici,  for these claims  were not urged  by the\nplaintiffs  in the  court below.

Testing  the sturdiness of  one or  the\n\nother  of  these  barriers  in  a  given  case  will  require  \"a\n\nparticularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and\n\ntribal  interests  at stake.\"    White Mountain  Apache  Tribe v.\r                                                                        \n\nBracker, 448 U.S. 136, 145  (1980).

Having exhausted the limits of the case in controversy,\n\nwe must depart  the stage, leaving it set  for the possibility of\n\nfuture litigation.\n                    \r                              \n\n     23It is  important to note, however,  that jurisdiction over\nclass  III gaming is subject to restoration, in whole or in part,\nas a negotiated by-product of a tribal-state compact. \n\n                                46\r\n\n          In  parting, we  offer a  few words  of guidance.   The\n\ncrucial  questions which  must yet  be answered  principally deal\n\nwith  the nature of  the regulable activities which  may   or may\n\nnot   be subject to state control, e.g., zoning, traffic control,\r                                                 \n\nadvertising, lodging.  It  is true that nondiscriminatory burdens\n\nimposed on  the activities  of non-Indians  on  Indian lands  are\n\ngenerally upheld.   See, e.g., Washington  v. Confederated Tribes\r                                                                           \n\nof  Colville  Indian  Reservation,   447  U.S.  134,  151  (1980)\r                                           \n\n(discussing  tax  burdens).     But  it  is  also  true   that  a\n\ncomprehensive  federal regulatory  scheme governing  a particular\n\narea typically  leaves no  room for  additional state  burdens in\n\nthat area.   See  White Mountain Apache  Tribe, 448  U.S. at  148\r                                                        \n\n(finding  state  timber  regulation  to  be  preempted).    Which\n\nactivities are deemed regulable, therefore, will probably depend,\n\nin the first instance, on which activities are deemed integral to\n\ngaming.  Although  the core functions of class III  gaming on the\n\nsettlement land  are beyond Rhode Island's  unilateral reach, the\n\ndistinction  between core functions  and peripheral  functions is\n\ntenebrous,  as is the question  of exactly what  Rhode Island may\n\nand  may not do with  respect to those  functions that eventually\n\nare determined to be peripheral.\n\n          If   these   criss-crossing  lines   prove  agonizingly\n\ndifficult to decipher, let alone to administer, they \"are no more\n\nor less so than  many of the classifications that pervade the law\n\nof Indian jurisdiction.\"  Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation, 439\r                                                                      \n\nU.S.  463, 502  (1979).   And in  all events,  the jurisdictional\n\n                                47\r\n\nissues remain subject to  further judicial intervention, pursuant\n\nto  the Gaming  Act,  in a  more  fact-specific context,  if  the\n\nparties' compact negotiations collapse.\n\n          We  can go no further  at this time.   We add, however,\n\nthat although our opinion today answers some questions and raises\n\nothers,  we do not mean to encourage the protagonists to litigate\n\nad  infinitum.  The parties'  baseline power need  not be defined\r                       \n\nwith exactitude  by  judicial decree  where,  as here,  they  are\n\ncompelled  to enter negotiations out  of which will  emerge a new\n\nbalance  of  power.     The  next  step  in  the   allocation  of\n\njurisdiction  over gaming is in the hands of the parties, through\n\nnegotiations  designed  to  produce  a  tribal-state  compact  as\n\ncontemplated by the Gaming Act, see 25 U.S.C.   2710(d).  If cool\r                                             \n\nheads and  fair-minded  thinking prevail,  that step  may be  the\n\nlast.\n\n          The district court's issuance of a mandatory injunction\r                    The district court's issuance of a mandatory injunction\r                                                                           \n\ncompelling Rhode Island  to commence good faith  negotiation of a\r          compelling Rhode Island  to commence good faith  negotiation of a\r                                                                           \n\ntribal-state  compact  is  affirmed.

With\r                                                    \n\nunderstandable  respect for  the  effort evident  in the  court's\n\nopinion, and with full recognition of the closeness of this case,\n\nI  reluctantly am unable to  accept its evaluation of legislative\n\nhistory  and its conclusion that the Gaming Act worked an implied\n\nrepeal of the Settlement Act.\n\n          The court, in my view, errs in two respects.  First, it\n\ninvokes   a   generally   applicable   principle   of   statutory\n\ninterpretation  --  statutory   language,  if  clear,  forecloses\n\nrecourse to legislative history -- in an area where this teaching\n\nis not  so absolute, i.e.,  when two federal  statutes, literally\n\nread, are in tension.  Second, when the court deigns to  consider\n\nthe  legislative  history  of  the  later,  supposedly  impliedly\n\nrepealing   statute,   the   Gaming  Act,   it   undervalues  it,\n\ncharacterizing it  as \"carefully selected snippets\"  that \"fail[]\n\nto establish .  . . a  clearly expressed legislative  intention.\"\n\nAnte pp. 25-26. \r              \n\n          The most apposite recent authority  of which I am aware\n\nis Watts  v. Alaska, 451  U.S. 259  (1981), in which  two federal\r                             \n\nstatutes  contained  irreconcilably  different  formulae  for the\n\ndistribution  of revenues from the lease or sale of minerals from\n\nwildlife refuges.   The Court acknowledged  that the consolidated\n\ncases before it  \"involve[d] two  statutes each of  which by  its\n\nliteral  terms applies  to the  facts before  us.\"   Id.  at 266.\r                                                                  \n\nThere, as here, the argument was made that  the plain language of\n\nthe  later statute  controlled and  made  improper any  resort to\n\n                                49\r\n\nlegislative history.\n\n          The Court  agreed that  the statutory language  was the\n\nstarting  point, but  stated that  \"ascertainment of  the meaning\n\napparent on the face of a single statute need not end the inquiry\n\n.  . .  because the  plain meaning  rule is  `rather an  axiom of\n\nexperience   than  a   rule  of   law,  and  does   not  preclude\n\nconsideration  of  persuasive  evidence   if  it  exists.'    The\n\ncircumstances  of the  enactment  of  particular legislation  may\n\npersuade a court  that Congress  did not intend  words of  common\n\nmeaning  to have their literal effect.\"  Id. at 265-66 (citations\r                                                      \n\nand footnote omitted).\n\n          The Court then stated:\n\n          Without depreciating this  general rule [that  the more\n          recent  of  two  irreconcilably   conflicting  statutes\n          governs], we decline to read  the statutes as being  in\n          irreconcilable  conflict  without seeking  to ascertain\n          the actual  intent of Congress.  Our examination of the\n          legislative   history  is  guided   by  another  maxim:\n          \"`repeals by  implication are not favored,'\"  Morton v.\r                                                                        \n          Mancari, 417  U.S. at 549, quoting  Posadas v.

So far as  I have been\n\nable to ascertain, Watt has not been eroded since its issuance.\r                                 \n\n          It seems clear  to me, at  least, that the  legislative\n\nhistory in  this record reveals not  merely the lack of  a \"clear\n\nand manifest\" Congressional intent  to repeal, but an affirmative\n\nintent that  the pre-existing  legislation should remain  intact.\n\nAn examination of  the history reveals an express  explanation, a\n\ndeliberate, pre-planned  colloquy with  the floor manager  of the\n\nlegislation  (the  chairman of  the  Select  Committee on  Indian\n\nAffairs)  as the  very  first exchange  with interested  Senators\n\nfollowing his introductory presentation.\n\n          In  his presentation,  Senator Inouye referred  both to\n\nthe objective  of \"determining what patterns  of jurisdiction and\n\nregulation  should govern  the  conduct of  gaming activities  on\n\nIndian lands\" and affirmed the principle \"that by virtue of their\n\noriginal tribal sovereignty, tribes reserved  certain rights when\n\nentering into  treaties with the  United States, and  that today,\n\ntribal  governments retain  all  rights that  were not  expressly\n\nrelinquished.\"  134 Cong. Rec. S12649 (daily ed. Sept. 15, 1988).\n\n          Immediately  at   the  conclusion  of   the  chairman's\n\npresentation, the following colloquy took place:\n\n    Mr. PELL. \n    Mr. President,  I would like to thank the managers of S. 555,\nthe Indian   Gaming Regulatory Act, and particularly the chairman\nof the Select Committee on Indian Affairs [Mr. Inouye], for their\nhard work and patience in achieving a consensus on this important\nmeasure. \n    In the  interests  of clarity,  I  have asked  that  language\nspecifically citing  the protections  of the Rhode  Island Indian\n\n                                51\r\n\nClaims  Settlement Act  (Public Law 95-395)  be stricken  from S.\n555. I understand that  these protections clearly will remain  in\neffect. \n    Mr. INOUYE. \n    I thank  my colleague, the  senior Senator from  Rhode Island\n[Mr.  Pell], and  assure him  that the  protections of  the Rhode\nIsland  Indian Claims  Settlement  Act (P.L. 95-395), will remain\nin effect  and that  the Narragansett  Indian Tribe  clearly will\nremain subject to the civil, criminal, and regulatory laws of the\nState of Rhode Island. \n    Mr. CHAFEE. \n    Mr.  President, I too would  like to thank  the chairman [Mr.\nInouye]  and  members of  the Select Committee  on Indian Affairs\nfor  their cooperation and  assistance. The  chairman's statement\nmakes it clear that any high  stakes  gaming, including bingo, in\nRhode Island will  remain subject  to the civil,   criminal,  and\nregulatory laws of our State.   \n\n134 Cong. Rec. S12650 (daily ed. Sept. 15, 1988).\n\n          Following the colloquy other senators made  comments or\n\nasked questions.    A  colloquy  similar to  that  quoted  above,\n\nbetween Senator Reid  and the chairman, established the extent to\n\nwhich  an  earlier piece  of  legislation  dealing with  gambling\n\ndevices would be altered by the bill under discussion.  134 Cong.\n\nRec. S12650 (daily ed.  Sept. 15, 1988).  Still  another exchange\n\nconcerned  the  scope  of  actions allowed  under  a  grandfather\n\nclause.  134 Cong. Rec. S12651.\n\n          Were  such  responsible and  calculated  floor exhanges\n\nwith  managers  of legislation  to be  rendered  of little  or no\n\naccount, the character of the legislating process would  suffer a\n\nsubstantial   constriction,  and   a   valued   opportunity   for\n\nclarification, minor  correction, and fine tuning  would be lost.\n\nI  do not  think the  judiciary  should be  a party  to any  such\n\nresult.\n\n          Certainly in the instant case, this legislative history\n\n                                52\r\n\nsupports the  conclusion that  the Rhode Island  Senators thought\n\nthe  implied repeal  language  unnecessary because  they did  not\n\nbelieve  that the  jurisdictional  provisions of  the Gaming  Act\n\napplied  to  the Settlement  Act.   That  this accorded  with the\n\nintent  of the  Senate  seems equally  clear,  unless we  are  to\n\nproclaim this  traditional kind of colloquy  with leadership mere\n\nsmoke and mirrors.\n\n          I think it also worth noting that the colloquy includes\n\na  statement  by the  bill's  sponsor  and floor  manager,  whose\n\nremarks usually are afforded substantial weight.  See North Haven\r                                                                           \n\nBd. of Educ.  v.

Maritime Academy, 762 F.2d 142, 149 (1st Cir. 1985).\r                                \n\n          I  add that  the colloquy,  although clear  and  to the\n\npoint, is not  the only  evidence of Congressional  intent.   The\n\nSenate  report also  mentions that  \"nothing in the  [Gaming Act]\n\nwill  supersede any  specific  restriction or  specific grant  of\n\nFederal authority  or  jurisdiction  to  a  State  which  may  be\n\nencompassed  in  another  Federal  statute,  including the  Rhode\n\nIsland  Claims  Settlement  Act  [and the  Maine]  Indian  Claims\n\nSettlement Act.\"  S.Rep. No. 446, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 12 (1988),\n\nreprinted in  1988 U.S.C.C.A.N.  3071, 3082 (citations  omitted).\r                      \n\nWhile  the court  concludes that  the report,  issued  before the\n\ndeletion  proposed by Senator Pell, is of no present relevance, I\n\ndo not think it can so easily be discounted.  Rather, it seems to\n\nme entirely consistent  with the colloquy  with the Rhode  Island\n\nsenators.\n\n                                53\r\n\n          If,  therefore,   we  assign   proper  weight   to  the\n\nlegislative history, I think it unavoidable that we would have to\n\nconclude  that the Gaming Act  had effected no  implied repeal of\n\nthe Settlement  Act.  If,  of course, the  Congress were to  feel\n\nthat an injustice had been done  to appellees, it could provide a\n\nremedy through supplemental legislation.24\n\n          I therefore, with great reluctance, dissent.\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     24Our circuit similarly has looked to legislative history to\nhelp  resolve a conflict between  a federal and  a state statute.\nIn Local Div. 589 v. Massachusetts, 666 F.2d 618 (1st Cir. 1981),\r                                            \nwe were  asked to  determine whether    13(c) of  the Urban  Mass\nTransportation Act  of 1964,  49 U.S.C.     1609(c), preempted  a\nconflicting Massachusetts statute.   The text of   13(c)  did not\nanswer this question.   Our close examination of  the legislative\nhistory,  however, persuaded us that Congress  did not intend for\nthis statute to preempt conflicting Massachusetts law.\n\n                                54\r\n",

This determination is tinged with more than the usual quotient of public interest, because the Tribe's ability to import casino gambling into Rhode Island likely hangs in the balance.  After careful reconnaissance of a littered legal landscape, we set aside the district court's determination that the parties' dispute over the applicability of state jurisdiction is not yet ripe for adjudication and hold that Congress's grant of jurisdiction to the state in the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1978, 25 U.S.C.

We conclude, despite the state's vehement protests, that the Gaming Act does not specially exempt the lands in question;  that the Narragansetts have concurrent jurisdiction over, and exercise governmental power with respect to, those lands, and, therefore, are entitled to invoke the Gaming Act;  and that, to the extent of the jurisdictional conflict between the Settlement Act and the Gaming Act, the former is impliedly repealed.  In the end, we affirm both the district court's directive that Rhode Island enter into good faith negotiations to draft a tribal-state compact under which gaming operations can be mounted and its refusal to grant relief to various governmental figures and entities who have challenged the Tribe's entitlement to the extraordinary prophylaxis of the Gaming Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE SETTLEMENT LANDS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a thumbnail sketch of how the land mass that is the breeding ground for this dispute came to be held in trust for the Tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1970s, the Tribe asserted title claims to certain lands in Charlestown, Rhode Island, and, encountering resistance, pursued these claims in the federal courts.  See Town of Charlestown v. United States, 696 F.Supp. 800, 801-05 (D.R.I.1988) (recounting history of dispute), aff'd, 873 F.2d 1433 (1st Cir.1989) (table).  In 1978, the Tribe, the state, and the Town of Charlestown signed a joint memorandum of understanding (J-MEM) purporting to settle their differences.  The Tribe agreed, inter alia, to the extinguishment of its title claims.  In return, it obtained valuable consideration, including a lump-sum payment and effective control over roughly 1800 acres in Charlestown (the settlement lands), half donated by the state and half by private landowners.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The titleholders agreed to deed the property to a nascent corporation which would be formed to hold title for the Tribe's benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Congress possesses plenary power over Indian matters, see Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 551-52, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 2483-84, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974), the parties sought its blessing.  In response, Congress passed the Settlement Act, a law that, for the most part, tracks the J-MEM.  In 1978, the state legislature approved the Narragansett Indian Land Management Corporation Act, 6A R.I. Gen. Laws Secs. 37-18-1 to 37-18-15 (1990) (the State Act), thereby creating the nominee corporation that would hold title to the settlement lands.  The necessary conveyancing followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next five years passed without relevant incident.  Then, in 1983, the Secretary of the Interior, acting pursuant to departmental regulations, see 25 C.F.R., Part 83 (1993), officially recognized the Narragansetts as an Indian tribe.  See 48 Fed.Reg. 6177-78 (Feb. 2, 1983).  On the heels of federal recognition, the settlement lands changed hands twice more.  In 1985, the Rhode Island General Assembly amended the State Act to permit the holding company to transfer title to the Tribe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The corporation complied.  In September of 1988, less than a month before the Gaming Act became law, the Tribe deeded the settlement lands to the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (the Bureau) as trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE GAMING ACT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gaming Act is an expression of Congress's will in respect to the incidence of gambling activities on Indian lands.  The statute sets in place a sophisticated regulatory framework, defining a species of gambling, called \"gaming,\" and dividing it into tiers, called \"classes.\"   Each class connotes a different level of gambling activity and, consequently, each class is regulated to a varying degree of stringency.  See 25 U.S.C. Secs. 2703(6)-2703(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Class I gaming--which consists, essentially, of Indian ritual gambling--always can be conducted on Indian lands.  See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2710(a)(1).  Class II gaming--which encompasses bingo--can be conducted as of right on Indian lands in any state, such as Rhode Island, that does not generally proscribe activities of that type.  See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2710(b)(1)(A).  Class III gaming--a residual category that includes what is commonly thought of as casino gambling--is permitted by compact;  and, moreover, a state is obliged to negotiate such a compact in good faith with a sponsoring tribe unless the state bans all persons throughout its territory from conducting class III gaming.  See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2710(d).  Short of an outright ban--and few state legislatures have indicated a willingness to go that far<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>--the tribal-state compact is the exclusive method of regulating class III gaming.  The method of the Gaming Act prevents a state from frustrating the introduction of class III gaming by an endless filibuster, for there are tight time parameters within which compact negotiations must be brought to fruition once a federal court finds that a state has failed to bargain in good faith.  See id. Sec. 2710(d)(7)(B).  As a practical matter, then, a state ordinarily may regulate casino gambling on Indian lands only in pursuance of a consensual compact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the case at bar revolves around class III gaming, the centrality of this last point cannot be overstated.  One of the Gaming Act's fundamental policies is that \"Indian tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming activity on Indian lands....\"  Id. Sec. 2701(5).  The legislative history of the statute draws out the implications of this policy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The mechanism for facilitating the unusual relationship in which a tribe might affirmatively seek the extension of State jurisdiction and the application of state laws to activities conducted on Indian land is a tribal-State compact.  In no instance does [the Gaming Act] contemplate the extension of State jurisdiction or the application of State laws for any other purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 446, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 6, reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3071, 3075-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under our tripartite system of government, Congress, not the courts, is empowered to make such policy choices.  See Irons v. FBI, 811 F.2d 681, 689 (1st Cir.1987) (acknowledging that the legislative branch sets policy by means of statutes and the courts must honor the legislature's policy choices and enforce the statutes).  Thus, the courts have not focused on the wisdom of the policies underlying the Gaming Act, but have followed the legislative lead and recognized that the very structure of the Gaming Act forbids the assertion of state civil or criminal jurisdiction over class III gaming except when the tribe and the state have negotiated a compact that permits state intervention.  See, e.g., United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians v. Oklahoma, 927 F.2d 1170, 1177 (10th Cir.1991);  Sycuan Band of Mission Indians v. Roache, 788 F.Supp. 1498, 1504 (S.D.Cal.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 1992, the Tribe formally requested that Rhode Island enter into good faith bargaining designed to produce a tribal-state compact that would allow construction and operation of a casino, i.e., inauguration of class III gaming, on the settlement lands.  Rhode Island declined to negotiate, instead filing suit in the federal district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The state asked the court to declare that the Gaming Act does not apply to the settlement lands, and that, therefore, those lands are subject to Rhode Island's general criminal and civil laws (including its civil regulatory laws).  The state also sought to enjoin the development of gambling facilities on the settlement lands and to block negotiations antecedent to a tribal-state compact.  The Tribe answered and counterclaimed for declaratory and injunctive relief that would pave the way for casino gambling on the settlement lands.  The tribe requested, among other things, a declaration that the state's civil regulatory laws do not apply to the settlement lands;  a declaration that the Narragansetts are entitled to operate a class III casino on those lands in conformance with the Gaming Act;  and a mandatory injunction commanding the state to negotiate in good faith toward a compact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered cross motions for summary judgment premised on a joint statement of uncontroverted facts.  After pondering the parties' proffers, the court deferred substantive consideration of the dispute over the general applicability of state and local jurisdiction, citing ripeness concerns.  See Rhode Island v. Narragansett Tribe of Indians, 816 F.Supp. 796, 799-800 (D.R.I.1993).  The court then assumed, for argument's sake, that the state had been granted jurisdiction over the settlement lands by virtue of the Settlement Act.  See id. at 804.   Proceeding on that assumption, the court concluded that any such grant was \"preempted\" by the Gaming Act, and, consequently, had no enduring force or effect.  Id.  Based on these findings, the court ordered the state to enter into good faith negotiations to formulate a tribal-state compact.  See id. at 806.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching the conclusion that the Gaming Act controlled, the court divided its reasoning into four parts.  First, it cited with approval three precedents holding that the Gaming Act overrode other federal statutes of earlier vintage.  See id. at 801-02.   Second, it found the evidence of Congress's intent to place Rhode Island beyond the Gaming Act's sphere to be unpersuasive in the absence of textual support in the statute.  See id. at 802-04.   Third, it dismissed the suggestion that the Gaming Act could not trump the Settlement Act because the former was the more general of the two statutory schemes.  See id. at 804.   Fourth, it determined that the Tribe \"ha[d] jurisdiction\" and \"exercise[d] governmental power\" over the settlement lands in sufficient measure to animate the Gaming Act.  See id. at 805-06.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal, the district court stayed its order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE DECISIONAL FRAMEWORK</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search for statutory meaning inevitably reduces to a pure question of law.  Thus, the issues on appeal engender de novo review, to be conducted without special deference to the district court's views.  See, e.g., FDIC v. Keating, 12 F.3d 314, 316 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam);  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 757 (1st Cir.1992).  When a court interprets statutes that touch on Indian sovereignty, general rules of construction apply, but they must be visualized from a distinctive perspective.  The Court has described this coign of vantage:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>The underlying premise is that congressional intent will control.  In determining this intent, we are cautioned to follow \"the general rule that \"[d]oubtful expressions are to be resolved in favor of [Indians]\"....  But the \"general rule\" does not command a determination ... in the face of congressionally manifested intent to the contrary.  In all cases, \"the face of the Act,\" the \"surrounding circumstances,\" and the \"legislative history,\" are to be examined with an eye toward determining what congressional intent was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U.S. 584, 586-87, 97 S.Ct. 1361, 1363, 51 L.Ed.2d 660 (1977) (citations omitted);  see also South Carolina v. Catawba Indian Band, 476 U.S. 498, 506 &amp; n. 16, 106 S.Ct. 2039, 2044 &amp; n. 16, 90 L.Ed.2d 490 (1986) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our search follows an odd trajectory in this case, because it starts down a road that the district court chose not to explore, and, once that journey is ended, proceeds to trace the path of an argument that ultimately proves to be a dead end.  Although this approach is unorthodox, we think it facilitates a systematic testing of the appellants' core contention:  that the settlement lands lie beyond the Gaming Act's reach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of our approach makes it desirable that we set out a roadmap.  We propose, in the following two parts, to deal with the Settlement Act, for, if that statute did not confer state jurisdiction in respect to the settlement lands, or if state jurisdiction, once conferred, vanished before the Gaming Act materialized, then the state's case would necessarily founder.  To this end, we discuss in Part V whether the jurisdictional inquiry is ripe;  finding that it is, we discuss in Part VI the validity and scope of the jurisdiction ceded to the state by the Settlement Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we must consider the Gaming Act's effect on the state's jurisdiction.  In Part VII, we deal with--and rebuff--the state's suggestion that the settlement lands are entirely exempt from the Gaming Act.  In Part VIII, we deal with--and rebuff--the state's argument that, even absent a categorical exemption, the Tribe's relationship to the settlement lands does not possess the attributes needed to trigger the Gaming Act's provisions.  The final curtain falls at the conclusion of Part IX, where we confront the interface between the Settlement Act and the Gaming Act, and test the district court's remedial order in the crucible of our understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. RIPENESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court declined to resolve the issue of state and local jurisdiction, finding no \"case of actual controversy\" sufficient to satisfy the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201 (1988).  Narragansett Tribe, 816 F.Supp. at 800.   Though we are mindful of the deference due to a district court's decision to withhold a grant of declaratory relief, see El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon, 963 F.2d 488, 492 (1st Cir.1992), we believe that the court abused its discretion in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>A. The Applicable Standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When faced with questions of ripeness in the declaratory judgment context, this court employs the test developed in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967).  The test, as phrased in our cases, contains two parts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>First, we consider whether an issue is fit for review, e.g., whether a challenged government action is final and whether determination of the merits turns upon facts which may not yet be sufficiently developed.  Second, we consider the question of hardship, a question which typically turns upon whether the challenged action creates a direct and immediate dilemma for the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">El Dia, 963 F.2d at 495 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);  accord W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. United States EPA, 959 F.2d 360, 364 (1st Cir.1992).  The key consideration in this analysis \"is the extent to which the claim involves uncertain and contingent events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\"  Lincoln House, Inc. v. Dupre, 903 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir.1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this test in the declaratory judgment context often requires custom tailoring, for there are at least two salient differences between declaratory actions and the mine-run of other cases:  first, declaratory relief is more likely to be discretionary;  and, second, declaratory actions contemplate an \"ex ante determination of rights\" that \"exists in some tension with traditional notions of ripeness.\"  Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology, 912 F.2d 643, 647 (3d Cir.1990).  Our opinion in El Dia responded to the first of these differences.  See El Dia, 963 F.2d at 491-93.   We believe that our opinion today responds to the second difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The linchpin of ripeness under the Declaratory Judgment Act, as in all Article III cases, is adverseness.  In a declaratory judgment action adverseness must be appraised in a practical, commonsense way.  Thus, satisfying the adverseness requirement demands that \"the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\"  Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941), citing Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 239-42, 57 S.Ct. 461, 463-65, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937).  This requirement should not be applied woodenly.  Most litigation has idiosyncratic features, and the adverseness criterion invites careful calibration on a case-by-case basis.  The line is often difficult to draw.  While a declaratory judgment should not be granted \"in speculative situations,\" Public Affairs Assocs., Inc. v. Rickover, 369 U.S. 111, 112, 82 S.Ct. 580, 581, 7 L.Ed.2d 604 (1962), a litigant \"does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.  If the injury is certainly impending that is enough.\"  Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conserv. &amp; Dev't Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 201, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 1720, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One sound way of gauging adverseness is to evaluate the nature of the relief requested.  The controversy must be such that it admits of \"specific relief through a decree of conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\"  Aetna Life, 300 U.S. at 240-41, 57 S.Ct. at 464.   Some courts call this measure of adverseness \"conclusivity\" and treat it as a separate requirement.  See, e.g., Armstrong World Indus., Inc. v. Adams, 961 F.2d 405, 421-23 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second part of the ripeness inquiry evoked by declaratory judgment actions is concerned with the hardship to the parties that would result from a refusal to consider granting relief.  We believe that this part of the inquiry should focus on the judgment's usefulness.  Rather than asking, negatively, whether denying relief would impose hardship, courts will do well to ask, in a more positive vein, whether granting relief would serve a useful purpose, or, put another way, whether the sought-after declaration would be of practical assistance in setting the underlying controversy to rest.  See Step-Saver, 912 F.2d at 647.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This formulation is hardly a radical departure from Abbott Laboratories and its progeny, for the one question may always be transformed into the other.  For example, to say that denying relief is tolerable where an adequate state remedy has been realized is tantamount to saying that granting the requested relief in such a situation would be pointless.  See El Dia, 963 F.2d at 495.   Indeed, the Court some time ago observed that one reason the legal issues must be crystallized in a declaratory action is to enable the trial judge to see \"some useful purpose to be achieved in deciding them.\"  Public Service Comm'n v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 244, 73 S.Ct. 236, 240, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952).  Furthermore, framing the hardship question in a positive fashion best comports with the spirit of the Declaratory Judgment Act.  As Judge Becker explained:  \"The idea behind the Act was to clarify legal relationships so that plaintiffs (and possibly defendants) could make responsible decisions about the future.\"  Step-Saver, 912 F.2d at 649 (citing legislative history).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>B. Applying the Standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court's ruling on ripeness flowed from the notion that neither the state nor the town would have any occasion to exercise reserved jurisdiction until the compact negotiation process ended, thereby clearing the way for class III gaming.  Narragansett Tribe, 816 F.Supp. at 799-800.   The court seemed to focus on the uncertainty of the situation, suggesting that the need for the relief requested depended on the occurrence of speculative events.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether state and local authorities retain any jurisdiction over the settlement lands is a question of immediate importance to all parties, separate and apart from the question of precisely what state and local jurisdiction survives.  We think, in fairness to the parties, that the former question must be settled before they are ordered to commence negotiations for a tribal-state compact.  Because the required interpretation of the Settlement Act projects a \"purely legal\" issue, W.R. Grace, 959 F.2d at 364, the resolution of which will not be changed by further factual development, and because it is of critical importance to the negotiation process in which the parties must engage, see infra Part IX(B), the case for a finding of adverseness is very powerful.  And, moreover, while it is true that the compact negotiations may bear on the timing of class III gaming and the allocation of regulatory responsibilities, the negotiations cannot effect the existence vel non of state and local jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The impetus for reaching the merits is strengthened because the other characteristics traditionally associated with ripeness are also extant.  We have no serious reservation about whether the proper parties are before the court or whether the requested ruling will, if granted, conclusively define the parties' baseline legal rights.  By like token, such a ruling would be of great near-term utility, facilitating the course of future tribal-state compact negotiations and clarifying to some extent the legal status of the settlement lands at a time when substantially expanded use seems highly probable.  Accordingly, we rule that the basic issue of state and local jurisdiction (although not the specific, fact-intensive permutations of that issue, see infra Part IX(C)) is ripe for declaratory judgment purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addressing the merits of this issue entails an examination of the validity and scope of the Settlement Act.  The Act states that, with two exceptions not relevant here,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> \"the settlement lands shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island.\"  25 U.S.C. Sec. 1708.  The Tribe maintains that this pronouncement was nugatory when made, or, if initially effective, was relegated to the scrap heap well before Congress enacted the Gaming Act.  The Tribe also maintains that, validity aside, any grant of jurisdiction excludes civil regulatory jurisdiction, and, therefore, has no bearing upon the proposed operation of a gambling casino.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>A. Validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tribe's basic position is that, even prior to the Gaming Act, section 1708 of the Settlement Act did not constitute a valid conferral of jurisdiction because, until federal recognition occurred in 1983, the Tribe had no jurisdiction to relinquish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This resupinate reasoning stands logic on its ear.  The Tribe did not surrender jurisdiction in 1978.  Rather, the Tribe, the state, and the town came to an agreement, spelled out in the J-MEM, to ask Congress, among other things, to grant jurisdiction to the state.  The Tribe has articulated no reason why, regardless of its legal status, Congress lacked the power to effectuate this jurisdictional grant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the Tribe is mistaken in its professed belief that it lacked jurisdictional power at the time of the Settlement Act.  Federal recognition is just that:  recognition of a previously existing status.  The purpose of the procedure is to \"acknowledg[e] that certain American Indian tribes exist.\"  25 C.F.R. Sec. 83.2 (1993).  The Tribe's retained sovereignty predates federal recognition--indeed, it predates the birth of the Republic, see Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 56, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 1675, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978)--and it may be altered only by an act of Congress, see Morton, 417 U.S. at 551-52, 94 S.Ct. at 2483.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tribe has two other arrows in its jurisdictional quiver.  First, it hypothesizes that section 1708 did not survive federal recognition.  This hypothesis is the mirror image of the hypothesis just considered:  rather than being cast as the prerequisite for the conferral of jurisdiction, recognition is taken to have nullified that conferral.  The two hypotheses suffer from the same infirmity.  Tribal sovereignty (and, hence, jurisdiction) may be neither augmented nor diminished except through congressional enactment.  Second, the Tribe suggests that, if section 1708 survived recognition, it did not survive the subsequent alienation of the settlement lands.  This suggestion goes nowhere.  Supposing that the jurisdictional grant contained in section 1708 could have been jettisoned by the state, the Tribe, or the Bureau without congressional sanction--a supposition we do not share--the fact is that, at every salient moment, the parties in interest took pains to reaffirm section 1708.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We conclude, therefore, that the grant of jurisdiction contained in section 1708 of the Settlement Act was valid when made, and was undiluted at the time Congress passed the Gaming Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>B. Scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Validity notwithstanding, it is an open question whether the jurisdictional grant contained in section 1708 extends to civil regulatory jurisdiction.  The Tribe insists not.  It tells us that the enacting Congress intended to copy the distinction between civil regulatory and civil adjudicatory jurisdiction limned two years earlier in Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U.S. 373, 96 S.Ct. 2102, 48 L.Ed.2d 710 (1976).  We find this tale to be both unsupported and unsupportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tribe's argument runs along the following lines.  In its view, there are salient discrepancies in respect to jurisdiction among the J-MEM, the original Senate bill leading to the Settlement Act, and the final version of the Act itself.  To illustrate the Tribe's point, we list the three versions of the jurisdictional clause side by side, in order of drafting.  According to three documents, the settlement lands were to be subject to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>All laws of the state ... including but not limited to state and local building, fire and safety codes [J-MEM, p 13];</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>the complete civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State....  [Joint Hearing on S.3153 and H.R. 12860, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., at 36, 51 (June 20, 1978) ];</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the State....  [18 U.S.C. Sec. 1708].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analogizing to Bryan, the Tribe posits that this progression signals Congress's intent to limit the jurisdictional grant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This proposed interpretation finds no succor in the legislative history.  Without such support, we think it is evident that the Narragansetts read too much into too little.  Considering the overall context, the deviations from one document to another do not strike us as especially significant.  The progressive development of the jurisdictional language can more plausibly be interpreted as intended to clarify the breadth of the grant, rather than to narrow it.  Perhaps the drafters feared that \"all laws of the state\" might suggest regulatory jurisdiction alone, and that \"civil and criminal jurisdiction\" might imply only jurisdiction in the judicial sense.  \"Civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction\" more obviously includes all sorts of jurisdiction, and can fairly lay claim to being the broadest of the three formulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only change arguably suggesting a diminution in the scope of jurisdiction is the removal of the word \"complete\" from the draft version of the bill.  We think that this change, too, may be understood as an attempt at clarification:  the word \"complete\" could well have been removed simply to avoid any suggestion that the grant of jurisdiction was intended to be exclusive.  Cf. United States v. Cook, 922 F.2d 1026, 1032 (2d Cir.)  (suggesting that \"exclusive jurisdiction\" and \"complete jurisdiction\" may have the same connotation), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 941, 111 S.Ct. 2235, 114 L.Ed.2d 477 (1991).  For that reason, the discrepant language is at best inconclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The small changes in phraseology pinpointed by the Tribe, floated without visible means of support, place this case at considerable remove from Bryan, a case in which the Court confronted a genuinely suggestive lingual discrepancy, and interpreted the final version of the statute in line with clearly articulated legislative history.  See Bryan, 426 U.S. at 379-87, 96 S.Ct. at 2106-10.   Here, by contrast, the discrepancies that the Tribe perceives are more conjectural than suggestive;  there is absolutely nothing in the legislative history of the Settlement Act that indicates congressional intent either to limit the scope of state jurisdiction or to carve a jurisdictional distinction along civil regulatory/civil adjudicatory lines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Thus, Bryan is not a fair congener.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our assessment is reinforced by a commonsense tenet of statutory construction.  Relatively minor differences between an Indian agreement and the ratifying act of Congress needed to give it effect, without more, do not give rise to an inference that Congress intended to modify the agreement.  See Rosebud Sioux, 430 U.S. at 599, 97 S.Ct. at 1369 (holding that a 1904 act of Congress did not modify a 1901 Indian agreement, despite a suggestive minor change in language).  At least when an \"implied continuity in purpose\" exists between the antecedent agreement and the subsequently enacted statute, courts should construe the latter to effectuate the former, notwithstanding differing linguistic choices.  Id.  So it is here, for the Settlement Act was designed to implement the agreement embodied in the J-MEM.  See, e.g., 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1701(d) (declaring that the J-MEM \"requires implementing legislation\");  Joint Hearing at 97 (acknowledging that \"the legislation as drafted intends to implement the settlement agreement\") (statement of Alan R. Parker, Gen. Counsel, Sen.  Select Comm. on Indian Affairs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not belabor the obvious.  Since the self-serving inference drawn by the Tribe is plainly at odds with the discernible intention undergirding the Settlement Act, and, in the bargain, plays havoc with the statutory text, we decline gratuitously to limit the scope of section 1708 in order to parallel the holding in Bryan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Cf. United States v. Dakota, 796 F.2d 186, 188 (6th Cir.1986) (refusing to extend Bryan distinction to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1955, because it would be inappropriate to apply a test \"developed in a different context to address different concerns\").  Hence, we conclude that the Settlement Act granted civil regulatory jurisdiction, as well as civil adjudicatory jurisdiction, to the state.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>C. Local Jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We digress to add a few words about local jurisdiction, mindful that the Town of Charlestown and certain municipal officials are parties to this lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we recognize both the town's desire to assert jurisdiction in respect to the settlement lands and the Tribe's opposition, we see nothing to be gained by giving separate treatment to the question of local jurisdiction.  As a general matter, municipal authority is entirely derivative of state authority, see 7A R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 45-2-1 (1991);  and in the exercise of governmental powers (as opposed to proprietary powers), municipalities act only as the agents of the state, see Buckhout v. City of Newport, 27 A.2d 317, 320 (R.I.1942).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows that if the state chooses to cede a portion of its sovereignty to the town, the town may use that authority to the extent of the power delegated.  See, e.g., Vukic v. Brunelle, 609 A.2d 938, 941 (R.I.1992).  But delegated powers, of necessity, cannot exceed those possessed by the delegator.  The town has cited no independent basis upon which it might exercise municipal jurisdiction, and none is apparent to us.  Thus, Charlestown's concerns are necessarily subsumed in our discussion of the state's jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. THE REACH OF THE GAMING ACT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the Tribe's ultimate argument--that the Gaming Act cancels whatever jurisdiction the Settlement Act granted--we must first consider both furcula of the state's assertion that the settlement lands are specifically exempted from the Gaming Act's domain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>A. The Consensual Transfer Provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gaming Act's so-called \"consensual transfer\" provision, familiarly known as \"section 23(d),\" is the site of the next battle.  It states in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>The United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction over criminal prosecutions of violations of State gambling laws that are made applicable under this section to Indian country, unless an Indian tribe pursuant to a Tribal-State compact ... or under any other provision of Federal law, has consented to the transfer to the State of criminal jurisdiction with respect to gambling on the lands of the Indian tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. Sec. 1166(d).  This proviso, Rhode Island asseverates, presages an exemption applicable to the settlement lands.  On this theory, section 23(d) allows a state lawfully to assert civil and criminal jurisdiction over gaming under either a tribal-state compact or \"any other provision of Federal law\" that embodies a consensual transfer of jurisdiction.  And it portrays section 1708 of the Settlement Act as constituting such an agreed transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation signifies a promiscuous elevation of hope over reason, for it completely overlooks two limitations that are apparent on the face of the statute.  First, section 23(d) is a penal provision that in terms deals only with criminal prosecutions;  it has no implications for civil jurisdiction (whether regulatory or adjudicatory).  Second, section 23(d) pertains only to \"gambling,\" which is defined for purposes of that section as excluding any kind of \"gaming.\"   See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1166(c).  Thus, properly understood, section 23(d) allows states to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to a consensual transfer only to enforce criminal laws that proscribe gambling activities falling outside the sanctuary of the Gaming Act.  This is of no assistance to Rhode Island, which seeks to assert unfettered jurisdiction (including civil regulatory jurisdiction) over activities constituting class II and class III gaming.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>B. Decrypting the Legislative History.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the state attempts a flanking maneuver.  Without meaningful citation to the Gaming Act's text, the state hawks the proposition that Congress, in passing the Act, intended to leave intact the grant of jurisdiction tendered a decade earlier in the Settlement Act.  And to fill the forensic void left by the utter absence of any statutory language to this effect, the state pushes forward carefully selected snippets of legislative history.  There are two significant problems with this approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, courts must look primarily to statutory language, not to legislative history, in determining the meaning and scope of a statute.  See, e.g., United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981);  Consumer Prod.  Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980);  United States v. Charles George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir.1987);  see also Felix Frankfurter, The Reading of Statutes, reprinted in Of Law and Men 60 (Philip Elman ed. 1956) (noting importance of statutory language and explaining that legislative intent \"is not drawn, like nitrogen, out of the air\").  When a statute's text is encompassing, clear on its face, and productive of a plausible result, it is unnecessary to search for a different, contradictory meaning in the legislative record.  See Charles George Trucking, 823 F.2d at 688;  United States v. Meyer, 808 F.2d 912, 915 (1st Cir.1987);  Massachusetts Fin.  Servs., Inc. v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 545 F.2d 754, 757 (1st Cir.1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 904, 97 S.Ct. 1696, 52 L.Ed.2d 388 (1977).  This is precisely such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, legislative history that is in itself inconclusive will rarely, if ever, overcome the words of a statute.  In a case such as this one, an inquiring court, at most, should resort to legislative history only to determine \"whether there is a 'clearly expressed legislative intention' contrary to [the statutory] language, which would require [the court] to question the strong presumption that Congress expresses its intent through the language it chooses.\"  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 432 n. 12, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1213 n. 12, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (quoting GTE Sylvania, 447 U.S. at 108, 100 S.Ct. at 2056).   After careful consideration of Rhode Island's extratextual arguments, we conclude that the material it musters fails to establish such a clearly expressed legislative intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state begins this phase of its case by pointing to a preliminary version of the Gaming Act that contained a provision (former section 23) safeguarding the Settlement Act from implied repeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Once that foundation is poured, the state then brings to the forefront a colloquy on the floor of the Senate involving Rhode Island's two senators, Messrs. Pell and Chafee, and Senator Inouye, sponsor and floor manager of the bill that became the Gaming Act, regarding the eventual deletion of former section 23 from the bill:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>Mr. PELL.  Mr. President, I would like to thank the managers of S.555, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and particularly the chairman of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs [Mr. Inouye], for their hard work and patience in achieving a consensus on this important measure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p>In the interests of clarity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> I have asked that language specifically citing the protections of the Rhode Island Claims Settlement Act (Public Law 95-395) be stricken from S.555.  I understand that these protections clearly will remain in effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>Mr. INOUYE.  I thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell], and assure him that the protections of the Rhode Island Claims Settlement Act (P.L. 95-395), will remain in effect and that the Narragansett Indian Tribe clearly will remain subject to the civil, criminal, and regulatory laws of the State of Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p>Mr. CHAFEE.  Mr. President, I too would like to thank the chairman [Mr. Inouye] and members of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs for their cooperation and assistance.  The chairman's statement makes it clear that any high stakes gaming, including bingo, in Rhode Island will remain subject to the civil, criminal and regulatory laws of our State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">134 Cong.Rec. S12,650 (daily ed. Sept. 15, 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we give full faith and credit to the earnestness of the senators involved in this exchange, we are unable to accept the colloquy at face value.  In the game of statutory interpretation, statutory language is the ultimate trump card.  Consequently, the overarching rule is that \"statements by individual legislators should not be given controlling effect\";  rather, such statements are to be respected only to the extent that they \"are consistent with the statutory language.\"  Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U.S. 253, 263, 106 S.Ct. 1834, 1841, 90 L.Ed.2d 248 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretive rule applies fully to the special case of statements by those members of Congress most intimately associated with a bill:  its floor manager and its sponsors.  The Court has so stated in unmistakable terms:  \"The contemporaneous remarks of a sponsor of legislation are certainly not controlling in analyzing legislative history.\"  Weinberger v. Rossi, 456 U.S. 25, 35 n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 1510, 1517 n. 15, 71 L.Ed.2d 715 (1982);  see also Brock, 476 U.S. at 263, 106 S.Ct. at 1840;  GTE Sylvania, 447 U.S. at 118, 100 S.Ct. at 2061;  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 311, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1722, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979);  cf. Grove City Coll. v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 567, 104 S.Ct. 1211, 1218, 79 L.Ed.2d 516 (1984) (explaining that remarks of a sponsor may be taken as authoritative to the extent that they are consistent with plain language).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Various courts of appeals, this court included, repeatedly have echoed the same theme.  See, e.g., North &amp; South Rivers Watershed Ass'n v. Scituate, 949 F.2d 552, 555 n. 6 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Tabacca, 924 F.2d 906, 911 (9th Cir.1991);  Devargas v. Mason &amp; Hanger-Silas Mason Co., 911 F.2d 1377, 1387 (10th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1074, 111 S.Ct. 799, 112 L.Ed.2d 860 (1991);  United States v. McGoff, 831 F.2d 1071, 1090-91 (D.C.Cir.1987);  Northern Colo.  Water Conservancy Dist. v. FERC, 730 F.2d 1509, 1518 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This overarching rule makes good sense, for floor statements afford solid evidence of congressional intent only when they jibe with the final version of the statutory text.  \"To permit ... clear statutory language to be materially altered by such colloquies, which often take place before the bill has achieved its final form, would open the door to the inadvertent, or perhaps even planned, undermining of the language actually voted on by Congress and signed into law by the President.\"  Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222, 237, 104 S.Ct. 3026, 3035, 82 L.Ed.2d 171 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another reason that this overarching rule makes sense is that, as a practical matter, most members of the enacting Congress will be familiar only with the bill as it stands when the vote occurs and, perhaps, with the committee reports, in broad outline of purpose;  they cannot be expected to be familiar with every stray floor statement, with every twist and turn of the bill's prior history, or with every other legislator's thoughts as to what the bill accomplishes (or stops short of accomplishing).  Cf., e.g., Hirschey v. FERC, 777 F.2d 1, 7-9 &amp; n. 1 (D.C.Cir.1985) (Scalia, J., concurring) (observing that members of Congress cannot be held accountable for lacking knowledge of minute details in committee reports).  It is particularly unrealistic to attribute knowledge of statements made on the Senate floor to House members, who gave their seal of approval to the Senate bill only after the Rhode Island exemption provision had been deleted, without mentioning Rhode Island's parochial concern.  See 134 Cong.Rec. H8146, H8426 (daily ed. Sept. 27, 1988) (commemorating passage by the House of Representatives).  For much the same reason, it is unrealistic to attribute such knowledge to the President.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our republican form of government, legislators make laws by writing statutes--an exercise that requires putting words on paper in a way that conveys a reasonably definite meaning.  Once Congress has spoken, it is bound by what it has plainly said, notwithstanding the nods and winks that may have been exchanged in floor debates and committee hearings.  After all, it is not the proper role of legislators to use unwritten assurances or side arrangements to alter the clear meaning of agreed language.  And the judiciary must stand as the ultimate guarantor of the integrity of an enacted statute's text.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, once Congress has spoken, a court cannot override the unambiguous words of an enacted statute and substitute for them the court's views of what individual legislators likely intended.  Any other rule imports a virulent strain of subjectivity into the interpretive task and, in the process, threatens to transfer too large a slice of legislative power from Congress to the courts.  See Frankfurter,  supra, at 60 (warning that courts should not be \"led off the trail by tests that have overtones of subjective design\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the colloquy upon which the state relies is an especially slender reed because it offers an explanation of Congress's action that defies a widely accepted principle of statutory construction.  When Congress includes limiting language in an early version of proposed legislation, and then rewrites the bill prior to enactment so as to scrap the limitation, the standard presumption is that Congress intended the proviso to operate without limitation.   See Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 432, 107 S.Ct. at 1213;   Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23-24, 104 S.Ct. 296, 300-01, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983);   United States v. Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, 897 F.2d 358, 362 n. 8 (8th Cir.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Deletion, without more, suggests that Congress simply had a change of heart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there is no \"more.\"   The state tries to buttress its argument by touting a comment in the Senate report to the effect \"that nothing in the [Gaming Act] will supersede any specific restriction or specific grant of Federal authority or jurisdiction to a State which may be encompassed in another Federal statute, including the Rhode Island Claims Settlement Act [and the Maine] Indian Claims Settlement Act.\"  1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3082 (citations omitted).  But this patch of legislative history is also threadbare.  The Senate report speaks only to the bill as reported out of committee;  it was composed before the deletion of the special Rhode Island exemption provision, former section 23, from the final version of the bill during floor debate.  Thus, the quoted statement sheds no light on Congress's intent regarding the law it actually enacted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>VIII. DOES THE GAMING ACT APPLY?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our odyssey is not yet finished, as the state and the amici construct a plausible textual argument as an amulet to ward off the Gaming Act.  This argument stems from the language limiting the applicability of the Gaming Act's key provisions to \"[a]ny Indian tribe having jurisdiction over Indian lands,\" or, stated differently, to \"Indian lands within such tribe's jurisdiction.\"   See 25 U.S.C. Secs. 2710(d)(3)(A), 2710(b)(1).  These are dual limitations, for one element of the definition of \"Indian lands\" requires that an Indian tribe \"exercise[ ] governmental power\" over them.  25 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(4).  Rhode Island claims that the Narragansetts do not \"hav[e] jurisdiction\" over, and do not exercise \"governmental power\" with respect to, the settlement lands;  and, thus, that the Gaming Act does not pertain.  Evaluating the state's thesis requires an exploration into another aspect of congressional intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>A. Having Jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the state's view, the phrase \"having jurisdiction,\" as used in the Gaming Act, must, insofar as the settlement lands are concerned, be gauged in light of the Settlement Act.  We agree.  But the mere fact that the Settlement Act cedes power to the state does not necessarily mean, as Rhode Island suggests, that the Tribe lacks similar power and, thus, lacks \"jurisdiction\" over the settlement lands.  Although the grant of jurisdictional power to the state in the Settlement Act is valid and rather broad, see supra Parts V(B), VI, we do not believe that it is exclusive.  To the contrary, we rule that the Tribe retains concurrent jurisdiction over the settlement lands and that such concurrent jurisdiction is sufficient to satisfy the corresponding precondition to applicability of the Gaming Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In undertaking the task of determining whether the Settlement Act's jurisdictional grant is exclusive in nature, it must be remembered that Indian sovereignty is \"a backdrop against which the applicable ... federal statutes must be read.\"  McClanahan v. State Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164, 172, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 1262, 36 L.Ed.2d 129 (1973).  This backdrop is a necessary adjunct to the search for legislative intent in the context of Indian-related legislation.   See Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163, 176, 109 S.Ct. 1698, 1707, 104 L.Ed.2d 209 (1989).  Consequently, we paint the backdrop before placing the statute at center stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Backdrop.   Indian tribes are \"distinct, independent political communities, retaining their original natural rights\" in matters of local governance.  Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 55, 98 S.Ct. at 1675, quoting Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S.  (6 Pett.) 515, 559, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832).  While tribal rights are retained at congressional sufferance and are subject to defeasance should Congress so elect, tribes retain their sovereign powers in full measure unless and until Congress acts to circumscribe them.  See United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 323, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 1086, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978).  As the Supreme Court has explained, \"Indian tribes still possess those aspects of sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or statute, or by implication as a necessary result of their dependent status.\"  Id.;  accord Bottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe, 599 F.2d 1061, 1065-66 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that jurisdiction is an integral aspect of retained sovereignty.  After all, the Court has held that retained sovereignty includes the power of Indians to make and enforce their own substantive law in internal matters, including matters such as membership rules, inheritance rules, and the regulation of domestic relations.  See Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 56, 98 S.Ct. at 1675 (citing cases).  Jurisdiction is cut from much the same fabric.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the shape of retained sovereignty has never been precisely defined.  Thus, it cannot be said with assurance whether or not criminal, civil adjudicatory, and civil regulatory jurisdiction, in whole cloth, are aspects of retained sovereignty.  But we have no need today to map such far-flung frontiers.  For present purposes, so long as the portion of jurisdiction encompassed within the natural rights of the Narragansetts is substantial enough to satisfy the Gaming Act's \"having jurisdiction\" prong, our inquiry is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state has not contended that any treaty impinges upon the Tribe's jurisdiction.  By like token, the record will not support a finding of jurisdiction abandoned or lost through implicit divestiture, see Wheeler, 435 U.S. at 326, 98 S.Ct. at 1087.   We are left, then, with the relatively confined question of whether the Tribe's retained jurisdiction has been forfeited by statute.  It is against this backdrop that we focus the lens of our inquiry on the Settlement Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Settlement Act.   By its terms, the Settlement Act purposes to do no more than grant jurisdiction to the state;  it does not expressly strip the Tribe of jurisdiction, transfer jurisdiction from the Tribe to the state, or employ suggestive adjectives like \"exclusive\" or \"complete\" in describing the jurisdictional grant.  The omission of the word \"exclusive\" looms particularly large in light of the use of that word elsewhere.  For instance, the word is used to modify the general jurisdictional grant in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1162 (1988), one of the few analogous statutes granting \"civil and criminal jurisdiction\" over Indian lands to an individual state.  Even more tellingly, the word is used in the Settlement Act itself, which characterizes as \"exclusive\" the grant to federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain certain constitutional challenges.  25 U.S.C. Sec. 1711.  This phenomenon commands our utmost attention, for where \"Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\"  Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U.S. 522, 525, 107 S.Ct. 1391, 1393, 94 L.Ed.2d 533 (1987) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not alone in our reluctance to infer exclusivity absent some suggestion to that effect in the statutory text.  At least one other court has found the omission of words such as \"exclusive\" or \"complete\" in a similar context to be meaningful.  See Cook, 922 F.2d at 1026, 1032-33 (concluding from the omission of any such language that a grant to New York of jurisdiction over Indian lands, embodied in 25 U.S.C. Sec. 232, is non-exclusive).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparative analysis is also instructive.  We think it is sensible to compare the jurisdictional grant embedded in the Settlement Act with the jurisdictional grants encased in two other Indian claims settlement acts that were to some extent modeled after the Settlement Act.  Both of the latter pieces of legislation--one involving Massachusetts, one involving Maine--contain grants of jurisdiction parallel to section 1708, expressed in similar language.  See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1771g (1988);  25 U.S.C. Sec. 1725 (1988).  Yet both acts also contain corresponding limits on Indian jurisdiction, conspicuously absent from the Settlement Act.  See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1771e(a);  25 U.S.C. Sec. 1725(f).  By placing stated limits on the retained jurisdiction of the affected tribes, these newer acts imply that an unadorned grant of jurisdiction to a state--such as is embodied in the Settlement Act--does not in and of itself imply exclusivity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find these factors to be of decretory significance.  Given the strong congressional bias, especially noticeable in the past generation, against policies that would promote Indian assimilation, see Bryan, 426 U.S. at 387-88 &amp; n. 14, 96 S.Ct. at 2110-11 &amp; n. 14, and also given Congress's fortunate penchant for great clarity when expressing its intent in this area, see id. at 389, 96 S.Ct. at 2111 (\"Congress kn[ows] well how to express its intent directly when that intent [is] to subject ... Indians to the full sweep of state laws.\");  Mattz v. Arnett, 412 U.S. 481, 504 n. 22, 93 S.Ct. 2245, 2258 n. 22, 37 L.Ed.2d 92 (1973) (observing that Congress generally employs \"clear language of express termination when that result is desired\") (collecting examples), we are of the view that acts diminishing the sovereign rights of Indian tribes should be strictly construed.  So here.  Since the Settlement Act does not unequivocally articulate an intent to deprive the Tribe of jurisdiction, we hold that its grant of jurisdiction to the state is non-exclusive.  The Narragansetts, therefore, have made the necessary threshold showing.  They retain that portion of jurisdiction they possess by virtue of their sovereign existence as a people--a portion sufficient to satisfy the Gaming Act's \"having jurisdiction\" prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>B. Exercising Governmental Power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to having jurisdiction, a tribe must exercise governmental power in order to trigger the Gaming Act.  Meeting this requirement does not depend upon the Tribe's theoretical authority, but upon the presence of concrete manifestations of that authority.  Consequently, an inquiring court must assay the jurisdictional history of the settlement lands.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Cf., e.g., DeCoteau v. District County Court, 420 U.S. 425, 442, 95 S.Ct. 1082, 1091, 43 L.Ed.2d 300 (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inquiry into governmental power need not detain us.  In the post-recognition period, the Tribe has taken many strides in the direction of self-government.  It has established a housing authority, recognized as eligible to participate in the Indian programs of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, see 24 C.F.R., Part 905 (1993).  It has obtained status as the functional equivalent of a state for purposes of the Clean Water Act, after having been deemed by the Environmental Protection Agency as having \"a governing body carrying out substantial governmental duties and powers,\" 33 U.S.C. Sec. 1377(e) (1988), and as being capable of administering an effective program of water regulation, see 40 C.F.R. Sec. 130.6(d) (1993).  It has taken considerable advantage of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA), a statute specifically designed to help build \"strong and stable tribal governments.\"  25 U.S.C. Sec. 450a(b) (1988).  The Tribe administers health care programs under an ISDA pact with the Indian Health Service, and, under ISDA contracts with the Bureau, administers programs encompassing job training, education, community services, social services, real estate protection, conservation, public safety, and the like.  These activities adequately evince that the Tribe exercises more than enough governmental power to satisfy the second prong of the statutory test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IX. THE INTERFACE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have concluded that the settlement lands, under the Tribe's auspices, meet both prerequisites of the Gaming Act, those lands are subject to the Act's benefits and burdens.  The task remaining is to determine how the Gaming Act and the Settlement Act operate in tandem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>A. Principles Governing the Interface.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In warming to this reconciliatory task, we abjure the preemption analysis undertaken below, see Narragansett Tribe, 816 F.Supp. at 804.   The doctrine of preemption is derived from the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const., Art.  VI, cl. 2, and therefore applies only to conflicts between federal provisions, on one hand, and state or local provisions, on the other hand.  See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 2617, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992).  The proper mode of analysis for cases that involve a perceived conflict between two federal statutes is that of implied repeal.  See Cook, 922 F.2d at 1033 (rejecting preemption analysis as inappropriate in resolving a conflict between the Gaming Act and an earlier federal statute);  see also 1A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland on Stat.  Const. Sec. 23.09 (5th ed. 1993).  Hence, we follow that analytic path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by reiterating the bedrock principle that implied repeals of federal statutes are disfavored.  In the absence of a contrary legislative command, when two acts of Congress touch upon the same subject matter the courts should give effect to both, if that is feasible.  See Pipefitters Local 562 v. United States, 407 U.S. 385, 432 n. 43, 92 S.Ct. 2247, 2272 n. 43, 33 L.Ed.2d 11 (1972);  United States v. Tynen, 78 U.S.  (11 Wall.) 88, 92, 20 L.Ed. 153 (1871).  In other words, so long as the two statutes, fairly construed, are capable of coexistence, courts should regard each as effective.  See Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535, 547-48, 108 S.Ct. 1372, 1381-82, 99 L.Ed.2d 618 (1988).  However, \"if the two [acts] are repugnant in any of their provisions, the latter act, without any repealing clause, operates to the extent of the repugnancy as a repeal of the first.\"  Tynen, 78 U.S.  (11 Wall.) at 92.   Even absent outright repugnancy, a repeal may be implied in cases where the later statute covers the entire subject \"and embraces new provisions, plainly showing that it was intended as a substitute for the first act.\"  Id.;  see also Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U.S. 497, 503-04, 56 S.Ct. 349, 352, 80 L.Ed. 351 (1936);  Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 824 F.2d 1258, 1278 (1st Cir.1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of implied repeal operates without special embellishment in the Indian law context.  See, e.g., Blackfeet Indian Tribe v. Montana Power Co., 838 F.2d 1055, 1058 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 828, 109 S.Ct. 79, 102 L.Ed.2d 56 (1988).  The rationale for encouraging preemption in the Indian context--that the federal government is a more trustworthy guardian of Indian interests than the states--has no relevance to a conflict between two federal statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p>B. Applying the Principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident that the Settlement Act and the Gaming Act are partially but not wholly repugnant.  The Settlement Act assigned the state a number of rights.  Among those rights--and by no means one of the rights at the epicenter of the negotiations leading up to the Act--was the non-exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction, in all customary respects save two, see supra note 6, over the settlement lands.  The Gaming Act leaves undisturbed the key elements of the compromise embodied in the Settlement Act.  It also leaves largely intact the grant of jurisdiction--but it demands an adjustment of that portion of jurisdiction touching on gaming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in respect to jurisdiction over gaming, the two laws do not collide head-on.  Thus, in connection with class III gaming, the Gaming Act does not in itself negate the state's jurisdiction, but, instead, channels the state's jurisdiction through the tribal-state compact process.  It is only with regard to class I and class II gaming that the Gaming Act ex proprio vigore bestows exclusive jurisdiction on qualifying tribes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  And it is only to these small degrees that the Gaming Act properly may be said to have worked a partial repeal by implication of the preexisting statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the area in which the two laws clash, the Gaming Act trumps the Settlement Act for two reasons.  First, the general rule is that where two acts are in irreconcilable conflict, the later act prevails to the extent of the impasse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  See Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 266, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 1677, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981);  Tynen, 78 U.S.  (11. Wall.) at 92;  see also 2B Singer, Sutherland on Stat.  Const., supra, Sec. 51.02, at 121.  Second, in keeping with the spirit of the standards governing implied repeals, courts should endeavor to read antagonistic statutes together in the manner that will minimize the aggregate disruption of congressional intent.  Here, reading the two statutes to restrict state jurisdiction over gaming honors the Gaming Act and, at the same time, leaves the heart of the Settlement Act untouched.  Taking the opposite tack--reading the two statutes in such a way as to defeat tribal jurisdiction over gaming on the settlement lands--would honor the Settlement Act, but would do great violence to the essential structure and purpose of the Gaming Act.  Because the former course keeps disruption of congressional intent to a bare minimum, that reading is to be preferred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our understanding of the statutory interface, we hold that the provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act apply with full force to the lands in Rhode Island now held in trust by the United States for the Narragansett Indian Tribe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p>C. Some Unanswered Questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this holding--a holding that resolves the case before us--it would be disingenuous to pretend that all the relevant questions have been answered.  While the Tribe retains all aspects of its retained sovereignty, as that term is commonly comprehended in our jurisprudence, Congress, after having granted to the state non-exclusive jurisdiction over the settlement lands via the Settlement Act, impliedly withdrew from that grant, via the Gaming Act, the state's jurisdiction over gaming.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Yet, the withdrawal of jurisdiction over gaming cannot be interpreted to signify a withdrawal of all residual jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This means that the state continues to possess a quantum of regulatory authority.  Of course, any effort by the state to exercise this residual authority is hedged in by barriers on both sides:  on one side, by the Tribe's retained rights of sovereignty;  on the other side, by the Tribe's congressionally approved authority over a specific subject matter, namely, gaming.  Testing the sturdiness of one or the other of these barriers in a given case will require \"a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake.\"  White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 145, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 2584, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980).  We cannot undertake such an inquiry in the abstract, and, thus, the jurisdictional status of the settlement lands remains ill-defined in certain respects.  But that is the nature of litigation;  Article III of the Constitution forbids courts from issuing advisory opinions or answering hypothetical questions.  See, e.g., International Longshoremen's &amp; Warehousemen's Union v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222, 224, 74 S.Ct. 447, 448, 98 L.Ed. 650 (1954);  United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 89, 67 S.Ct. 556, 564, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947).  Having exhausted the limits of the case in controversy, we must depart the stage, leaving it set for the possibility of future litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In parting, we offer a few words of guidance.  The crucial questions which must yet be answered principally deal with the nature of the regulable activities which may--or may not--be subject to state control, e.g., zoning, traffic control, advertising, lodging.  It is true that nondiscriminatory burdens imposed on the activities of non-Indians on Indian lands are generally upheld.  See, e.g., Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 151, 100 S.Ct. 2069, 2080, 65 L.Ed.2d 10 (1980) (discussing tax burdens).  But it is also true that a comprehensive federal regulatory scheme governing a particular area typically leaves no room for additional state burdens in that area.  See White Mountain Apache Tribe, 448 U.S. at 148, 100 S.Ct. at 2586 (finding state timber regulation to be preempted).  Which activities are deemed regulable, therefore, will probably depend, in the first instance, on which activities are deemed integral to gaming.  Although the core functions of class III gaming on the settlement land are beyond Rhode Island's unilateral reach, the distinction between core functions and peripheral functions is tenebrous, as is the question of exactly what Rhode Island may and may not do with respect to those functions that eventually are determined to be peripheral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If these criss-crossing lines prove agonizingly difficult to decipher, let alone to administer, they \"are no more or less so than many of the classifications that pervade the law of Indian jurisdiction.\"  Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 502, 99 S.Ct. 740, 762, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979).  And in all events, the jurisdictional issues remain subject to further judicial intervention, pursuant to the Gaming Act, in a more fact-specific context, if the parties' compact negotiations collapse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can go no further at this time.  We add, however, that although our opinion today answers some questions and raises others, we do not mean to encourage the protagonists to litigate ad infinitum.   The parties' baseline power need not be defined with exactitude by judicial decree where, as here, they are compelled to enter negotiations out of which will emerge a new balance of power.  The next step in the allocation of jurisdiction over gaming is in the hands of the parties, through negotiations designed to produce a tribal-state compact as contemplated by the Gaming Act, see 25 U.S.C.

First, it invokes a generally applicable principle of statutory interpretation--statutory language, if clear, forecloses recourse to legislative history--in an area where this teaching is not so absolute, i.e., when two federal statutes, literally read, are in tension.  Second, when the court deigns to consider the legislative history of the later, supposedly impliedly repealing statute, the Gaming Act, it undervalues it, characterizing it as \"carefully selected snippets\" that \"fail[ ] to establish ... a clearly expressed legislative intention.\"   Ante pp. 697-698.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most apposite recent authority of which I am aware is Watt v.

The Court acknowledged that the consolidated cases before it \"involve[d] two statutes each of which by its literal terms applies to the facts before us.\"  Id. at 266, 101 S.Ct. at 1678.   There, as here, the argument was made that the plain language of the later statute controlled and made improper any resort to legislative history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court agreed that the statutory language was the starting point, but stated that \"ascertainment of the meaning apparent on the face of a single statute need not end the inquiry ... because the plain meaning rule is 'rather an axiom of experience than a rule of law, and does not preclude consideration of persuasive evidence if it exists.'

An examination of the history reveals an express explanation, a deliberate, pre-planned colloquy with the floor manager of the legislation (the chairman of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs) as the very first exchange with interested Senators following his introductory presentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his presentation, Senator Inouye referred both to the objective of \"determining what patterns of jurisdiction and regulation should govern the conduct of gaming activities on Indian lands\" and affirmed the principle \"that by virtue of their original tribal sovereignty, tribes reserved certain rights when entering into treaties with the United States, and that today, tribal governments retain all rights that were not expressly relinquished.\"   134 Cong.Rec.

The chairman's statement makes it clear that any high stakes gaming, including bingo, in Rhode Island will remain subject to the civil, criminal, and regulatory laws of our State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">134 Cong.Rec.

A colloquy similar to that quoted above, between Senator Reid and the chairman, established the extent to which an earlier piece of legislation dealing with gambling devices would be altered by the bill under discussion.  134 Cong.Rec. S12650 (daily ed. Sept. 15, 1988).  Still another exchange concerned the scope of actions allowed under a grandfather clause.  134 Cong.Rec.

I do not think the judiciary should be a party to any such result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly in the instant case, this legislative history supports the conclusion that the Rhode Island Senators thought the implied repeal language unnecessary because they did not believe that the jurisdictional provisions of the Gaming Act applied to the Settlement Act.  That this accorded with the intent of the Senate seems equally clear, unless we are to proclaim this traditional kind of colloquy with leadership mere smoke and mirrors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think it also worth noting that the colloquy includes a statement by the bill's sponsor and floor manager, whose remarks usually are afforded substantial weight.  See North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 526-27, 102 S.Ct. 1912, 1920-21, 72 L.Ed.2d 299 (1982);  United States v. Mass.

The Senate report also mentions that \"nothing in the [Gaming Act] will supersede any specific restriction or specific grant of Federal authority or jurisdiction to a State which may be encompassed in another Federal statute, including the Rhode Island Claims Settlement Act [and the Maine] Indian Claims Settlement Act.\"   S.Rep. No. 446, 100th Cong.2d Sess. 12 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3071, 3082 (citations omitted).  While the court concludes that the report, issued before the deletion proposed by Senator Pell, is of no present relevance, I do not think it can so easily be discounted.  Rather, it seems to me entirely consistent with the colloquy with the Rhode Island senators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, therefore, we assign proper weight to the legislative history, I think it unavoidable that we would have to conclude that the Gaming Act had effected no implied repeal of the Settlement Act.  If, of course, the Congress were to feel that an injustice had been done to appellees, it could provide a remedy through supplemental legislation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I therefore, with great reluctance, dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The provenance of the two parcels remains of continuing legal relevance because the 900 acres donated by the state may be used only for conservation purposes.

See, e.g., DeBartolo Corp. v.

Congress could have avoided such ambiguity in a myriad of ways short of striking former section 23, say, by substituting a generic exemption for a category of states including Rhode Island, or by citing Rhode Island in a non-exhaustive list of states that would be exempted.

Our dissenting brother puts the very best face on the state's argument, yet the dissent, though gracefully written, contains nothing to shake our view of either the controlling legal principles or the legislative history.  While we plead guilty to the charge of literalism, placing strong emphasis on the statutory text is a court's proper function.  See, e.g., GTE Sylvania, 447 U.S. at 108, 100 S.Ct. at 2056 (declaring that statutory language \"must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive\");  Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 490, 37 S.Ct. 192, 196, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917) (explaining that \"when words are free from doubt they must be taken as the final expression of the legislative intent\").  Moreover, we have made a point of considering the legislative history of the Gaming Act on its own terms, in recognition of the continuing influence of less text-based theories of statutory interpretation, such as that underpinning Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981).  We believe that our result is compelled by any acceptable mode of interpretation</p>\n        <p>Finally, although we share Judge Coffin's reticence to discredit responsible floor exchanges, we fail to see how a floor exchange utterly at odds with the words of an enacted statute can be given primacy in the interpretive process.

We caution, however, that while Brien suggests that statutes may never be impliedly repealed in part, see id. at 309, more recent cases clarify the point, see, e.g., Bristol Energy Corp. v. New Hampshire PUC, 13 F.3d 471, 477 (1st Cir.1994).  The rule is that, generally, there can be no partial implied repeal absent repugnancy.   This is simply another way of stating that congressional intent to substitute a later act for an earlier one will ordinarily be implied only if the later act usurps the whole ground occupied by the first.  See Posadas, 296 U.S. at 504, 56 S.Ct. at 352.   If repugnancy is found, however, then a partial repeal is in most cases preferred--indeed, mandated--for only that part of the earlier statute which is plainly anathematic should be nullified</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> We take no view on whether, apart from the Gaming Act, a state might have regulated the activities that comprise class I gaming without violating the Free Exercise Clause</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The state argues that the Settlement Act should prevail because it is the more specific statute.  There are two cracks in this palladium.  As noted by the court below, it is arguable which statute is the more specific.  See Narragansett Tribe, 816 F.Supp. at 804.   More fundamentally, the canon upon which the state relies is rooted in the presumption that, when legislatures enact general laws, they do not have in mind every preexisting statute that touches on some specific aspect of the general subject.  Where, as here, the enacting Congress is demonstrably aware of the earlier law at the time of the later law's enactment, there is no basis for indulging the presumption</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> We decline to address certain constitutional claims advanced by the amici, for these claims were not urged by the plaintiffs in the court below.

Sec. 1609(c), preempted a conflicting Massachusetts statute.  The text of Sec. 13(c) did not answer this question.  Our close examination of the legislative history, however, persuaded us that Congress did not intend for this statute to preempt conflicting Massachusetts law</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Secs. 2701-2721, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1166-1168 (1988) (the Gaming Act), applies to lands now held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Narragansett Indian Tribe (the Tribe).  This determination is tinged with more than the usual quotient of public interest, because the Tribe's ability to import casino gambling into Rhode Island likely hangs in the balance.  After careful reconnaissance of a littered legal landscape, we set aside the district court's determination that the parties' dispute over the applicability of state jurisdiction is not yet ripe for adjudication and hold that Congress's grant of jurisdiction to the state in the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1978, 25 U.S.C. Secs. 1701-1716 (the Settlement Act), remains valid.  We also hold, contrary to the Tribe's importuning, that the grant includes civil regulatory jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that juncture, the tide turns.  We conclude, despite the state's vehement protests, that the Gaming Act does not specially exempt the lands in question;  that the Narragansetts have concurrent jurisdiction over, and exercise governmental power with respect to, those lands, and, therefore, are entitled to invoke the Gaming Act;  and that, to the extent of the jurisdictional conflict between the Settlement Act and the Gaming Act, the former is impliedly repealed.  In the end, we affirm both the district court's directive that Rhode Island enter into good faith negotiations to draft a tribal-state compact under which gaming operations can be mounted and its refusal to grant relief to various governmental figures and entities who have challenged the Tribe's entitlement to the extraordinary prophylaxis of the Gaming Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

In 1978, the Tribe, the state, and the Town of Charlestown signed a joint memorandum of understanding (J-MEM) purporting to settle their differences.  The Tribe agreed, inter alia, to the extinguishment of its title claims.  In return, it obtained valuable consideration, including a lump-sum payment and effective control over roughly 1800 acres in Charlestown (the settlement lands), half donated by the state and half by private landowners.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The titleholders agreed to deed the property to a nascent corporation which would be formed to hold title for the Tribe's benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Congress possesses plenary power over Indian matters, see Morton v.

In 1978, the state legislature approved the Narragansett Indian Land Management Corporation Act, 6A R.I. Gen. Laws Secs. 37-18-1 to 37-18-15 (1990) (the State Act), thereby creating the nominee corporation that would hold title to the settlement lands.

Then, in 1983, the Secretary of the Interior, acting pursuant to departmental regulations, see 25 C.F.R., Part 83 (1993), officially recognized the Narragansetts as an Indian tribe.  See 48 Fed.Reg. 6177-78 (Feb. 2, 1983).  On the heels of federal recognition, the settlement lands changed hands twice more.  In 1985, the Rhode Island General Assembly amended the State Act to permit the holding company to transfer title to the Tribe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The corporation complied.  In September of 1988, less than a month before the Gaming Act became law, the Tribe deeded the settlement lands to the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (the Bureau) as trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE GAMING ACT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gaming Act is an expression of Congress's will in respect to the incidence of gambling activities on Indian lands.  The statute sets in place a sophisticated regulatory framework, defining a species of gambling, called \"gaming,\" and dividing it into tiers, called \"classes.\"   Each class connotes a different level of gambling activity and, consequently, each class is regulated to a varying degree of stringency.  See 25 U.S.C. Secs. 2703(6)-2703(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Class I gaming--which consists, essentially, of Indian ritual gambling--always can be conducted on Indian lands.  See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2710(a)(1).  Class II gaming--which encompasses bingo--can be conducted as of right on Indian lands in any state, such as Rhode Island, that does not generally proscribe activities of that type.  See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2710(b)(1)(A).  Class III gaming--a residual category that includes what is commonly thought of as casino gambling--is permitted by compact;  and, moreover, a state is obliged to negotiate such a compact in good faith with a sponsoring tribe unless the state bans all persons throughout its territory from conducting class III gaming.  See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2710(d).  Short of an outright ban--and few state legislatures have indicated a willingness to go that far<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>--the tribal-state compact is the exclusive method of regulating class III gaming.  The method of the Gaming Act prevents a state from frustrating the introduction of class III gaming by an endless filibuster, for there are tight time parameters within which compact negotiations must be brought to fruition once a federal court finds that a state has failed to bargain in good faith.  See id. Sec. 2710(d)(7)(B).  As a practical matter, then, a state ordinarily may regulate casino gambling on Indian lands only in pursuance of a consensual compact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the case at bar revolves around class III gaming, the centrality of this last point cannot be overstated.  One of the Gaming Act's fundamental policies is that \"Indian tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming activity on Indian lands....\"  Id. Sec. 2701(5).  The legislative history of the statute draws out the implications of this policy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The mechanism for facilitating the unusual relationship in which a tribe might affirmatively seek the extension of State jurisdiction and the application of state laws to activities conducted on Indian land is a tribal-State compact.  In no instance does [the Gaming Act] contemplate the extension of State jurisdiction or the application of State laws for any other purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 446, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 6, reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3071, 3075-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under our tripartite system of government, Congress, not the courts, is empowered to make such policy choices.  See Irons v. FBI, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483245\"><a href=\"/opinion/483245/peter-irons-and-melvin-lewis-v-federal-bureau-of-investigation-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span>, 689 (1st Cir.1987) (acknowledging that the legislative branch sets policy by means of statutes and the courts must honor the legislature's policy choices and enforce the statutes).  Thus, the courts have not focused on the wisdom of the policies underlying the Gaming Act, but have followed the legislative lead and recognized that the very structure of the Gaming Act forbids the assertion of state civil or criminal jurisdiction over class III gaming except when the tribe and the state have negotiated a compact that permits state intervention.  See, e.g., United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians v. Oklahoma, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557289\"><a href=\"/opinion/557289/the-united-keetoowah-band-of-cherokee-indians-v-the-state-of-oklahoma-ex/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1170</span></a></span>, 1177 (10th Cir.1991);  Sycuan Band of Mission Indians v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1498</span></a></span>, 1504 (S.D.Cal.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 1992, the Tribe formally requested that Rhode Island enter into good faith bargaining designed to produce a tribal-state compact that would allow construction and operation of a casino, i.e., inauguration of class III gaming, on the settlement lands.  Rhode Island declined to negotiate, instead filing suit in the federal district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The state asked the court to declare that the Gaming Act does not apply to the settlement lands, and that, therefore, those lands are subject to Rhode Island's general criminal and civil laws (including its civil regulatory laws).  The state also sought to enjoin the development of gambling facilities on the settlement lands and to block negotiations antecedent to a tribal-state compact.  The Tribe answered and counterclaimed for declaratory and injunctive relief that would pave the way for casino gambling on the settlement lands.  The tribe requested, among other things, a declaration that the state's civil regulatory laws do not apply to the settlement lands;  a declaration that the Narragansetts are entitled to operate a class III casino on those lands in conformance with the Gaming Act;  and a mandatory injunction commanding the state to negotiate in good faith toward a compact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered cross motions for summary judgment premised on a joint statement of uncontroverted facts.  After pondering the parties' proffers, the court deferred substantive consideration of the dispute over the general applicability of state and local jurisdiction, citing ripeness concerns.  See Rhode Island v. Narragansett Tribe of Indians, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1976970\"><a href=\"/opinion/1976970/state-of-ri-v-narragansett-tribe-of-indians/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span>, 799-800 (D.R.I.1993).  The court then assumed, for argument's sake, that the state had been granted jurisdiction over the settlement lands by virtue of the Settlement Act.  See id. at 804.   Proceeding on that assumption, the court concluded that any such grant was \"preempted\" by the Gaming Act, and, consequently, had no enduring force or effect.  Id.  Based on these findings, the court ordered the state to enter into good faith negotiations to formulate a tribal-state compact.  See id. at 806.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching the conclusion that the Gaming Act controlled, the court divided its reasoning into four parts.  First, it cited with approval three precedents holding that the Gaming Act overrode other federal statutes of earlier vintage.  See id. at 801-02.   Second, it found the evidence of Congress's intent to place Rhode Island beyond the Gaming Act's sphere to be unpersuasive in the absence of textual support in the statute.  See id. at 802-04.   Third, it dismissed the suggestion that the Gaming Act could not trump the Settlement Act because the former was the more general of the two statutory schemes.  See id. at 804.   Fourth, it determined that the Tribe \"ha[d] jurisdiction\" and \"exercise[d] governmental power\" over the settlement lands in sufficient measure to animate the Gaming Act.  See id. at 805-06.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal, the district court stayed its order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE DECISIONAL FRAMEWORK</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search for statutory meaning inevitably reduces to a pure question of law.  Thus, the issues on appeal engender de novo review, to be conducted without special deference to the district court's views.  See, e.g., FDIC v. Keating, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195109\"><a href=\"/opinion/195109/fdic-v-keating/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 316 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam);  Liberty Mut.

When a court interprets statutes that touch on Indian sovereignty, general rules of construction apply, but they must be visualized from a distinctive perspective.  The Court has described this coign of vantage:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>The underlying premise is that congressional intent will control.  In determining this intent, we are cautioned to follow \"the general rule that \"[d]oubtful expressions are to be resolved in favor of [Indians]\"....  But the \"general rule\" does not command a determination ... in the face of congressionally manifested intent to the contrary.  In all cases, \"the face of the Act,\" the \"surrounding circumstances,\" and the \"legislative history,\" are to be examined with an eye toward determining what congressional intent was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosebud Sioux Tribe v.

Although this approach is unorthodox, we think it facilitates a systematic testing of the appellants' core contention:  that the settlement lands lie beyond the Gaming Act's reach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of our approach makes it desirable that we set out a roadmap.  We propose, in the following two parts, to deal with the Settlement Act, for, if that statute did not confer state jurisdiction in respect to the settlement lands, or if state jurisdiction, once conferred, vanished before the Gaming Act materialized, then the state's case would necessarily founder.  To this end, we discuss in Part V whether the jurisdictional inquiry is ripe;  finding that it is, we discuss in Part VI the validity and scope of the jurisdiction ceded to the state by the Settlement Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we must consider the Gaming Act's effect on the state's jurisdiction.  In Part VII, we deal with--and rebuff--the state's suggestion that the settlement lands are entirely exempt from the Gaming Act.  In Part VIII, we deal with--and rebuff--the state's argument that, even absent a categorical exemption, the Tribe's relationship to the settlement lands does not possess the attributes needed to trigger the Gaming Act's provisions.  The final curtain falls at the conclusion of Part IX, where we confront the interface between the Settlement Act and the Gaming Act, and test the district court's remedial order in the crucible of our understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.

In a declaratory judgment action adverseness must be appraised in a practical, commonsense way.

The controversy must be such that it admits of \"specific relief through a decree of conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\"  Aetna Life, 300 U.S. at 240-41, 57 S.Ct. at 464.   Some courts call this measure of adverseness \"conclusivity\" and treat it as a separate requirement.  See, e.g., Armstrong World Indus., Inc. v. Adams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581378\"><a href=\"/opinion/581378/armstrong-world-industries-inc-derivatively-by-tessie-wolfson-and-rodney/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, 421-23 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second part of the ripeness inquiry evoked by declaratory judgment actions is concerned with the hardship to the parties that would result from a refusal to consider granting relief.  We believe that this part of the inquiry should focus on the judgment's usefulness.  Rather than asking, negatively, whether denying relief would impose hardship, courts will do well to ask, in a more positive vein, whether granting relief would serve a useful purpose, or, put another way, whether the sought-after declaration would be of practical assistance in setting the underlying controversy to rest.  See Step-Saver, 912 F.2d at 647.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This formulation is hardly a radical departure from Abbott Laboratories and its progeny, for the one question may always be transformed into the other.  For example, to say that denying relief is tolerable where an adequate state remedy has been realized is tantamount to saying that granting the requested relief in such a situation would be pointless.  See El Dia, 963 F.2d at 495.   Indeed, the Court some time ago observed that one reason the legal issues must be crystallized in a declaratory action is to enable the trial judge to see \"some useful purpose to be achieved in deciding them.\"  Public Service Comm'n v. Wycoff Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105059\"><a href=\"/opinion/105059/public-serv-commn-of-utah-v-wycoff-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span>, 244, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105059\"><a href=\"/opinion/105059/public-serv-commn-of-utah-v-wycoff-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span> (1952).  Furthermore, framing the hardship question in a positive fashion best comports with the spirit of the Declaratory Judgment Act.  As Judge Becker explained:  \"The idea behind the Act was to clarify legal relationships so that plaintiffs (and possibly defendants) could make responsible decisions about the future.\"  Step-Saver, 912 F.2d at 649 (citing legislative history).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>B.

Narragansett Tribe, 816 F.Supp. at 799-800.   The court seemed to focus on the uncertainty of the situation, suggesting that the need for the relief requested depended on the occurrence of speculative events.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether state and local authorities retain any jurisdiction over the settlement lands is a question of immediate importance to all parties, separate and apart from the question of precisely what state and local jurisdiction survives.  We think, in fairness to the parties, that the former question must be settled before they are ordered to commence negotiations for a tribal-state compact.  Because the required interpretation of the Settlement Act projects a \"purely legal\" issue, W.R. Grace, 959 F.2d at 364, the resolution of which will not be changed by further factual development, and because it is of critical importance to the negotiation process in which the parties must engage, see infra Part IX(B), the case for a finding of adverseness is very powerful.  And, moreover, while it is true that the compact negotiations may bear on the timing of class III gaming and the allocation of regulatory responsibilities, the negotiations cannot effect the existence vel non of state and local jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The impetus for reaching the merits is strengthened because the other characteristics traditionally associated with ripeness are also extant.  We have no serious reservation about whether the proper parties are before the court or whether the requested ruling will, if granted, conclusively define the parties' baseline legal rights.  By like token, such a ruling would be of great near-term utility, facilitating the course of future tribal-state compact negotiations and clarifying to some extent the legal status of the settlement lands at a time when substantially expanded use seems highly probable.  Accordingly, we rule that the basic issue of state and local jurisdiction (although not the specific, fact-intensive permutations of that issue, see infra Part IX(C)) is ripe for declaratory judgment purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addressing the merits of this issue entails an examination of the validity and scope of the Settlement Act.  The Act states that, with two exceptions not relevant here,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> \"the settlement lands shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island.\"  25 U.S.C. Sec. 1708.  The Tribe maintains that this pronouncement was nugatory when made, or, if initially effective, was relegated to the scrap heap well before Congress enacted the Gaming Act.  The Tribe also maintains that, validity aside, any grant of jurisdiction excludes civil regulatory jurisdiction, and, therefore, has no bearing upon the proposed operation of a gambling casino.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>A. Validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tribe's basic position is that, even prior to the Gaming Act, section 1708 of the Settlement Act did not constitute a valid conferral of jurisdiction because, until federal recognition occurred in 1983, the Tribe had no jurisdiction to relinquish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This resupinate reasoning stands logic on its ear.  The Tribe did not surrender jurisdiction in 1978.  Rather, the Tribe, the state, and the town came to an agreement, spelled out in the J-MEM, to ask Congress, among other things, to grant jurisdiction to the state.  The Tribe has articulated no reason why, regardless of its legal status, Congress lacked the power to effectuate this jurisdictional grant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the Tribe is mistaken in its professed belief that it lacked jurisdictional power at the time of the Settlement Act.  Federal recognition is just that:  recognition of a previously existing status.  The purpose of the procedure is to \"acknowledg[e] that certain American Indian tribes exist.\"  25 C.F.R. Sec. 83.2 (1993).  The Tribe's retained sovereignty predates federal recognition--indeed, it predates the birth of the Republic, see Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109857\"><a href=\"/opinion/109857/santa-clara-pueblo-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109857\"><a href=\"/opinion/109857/santa-clara-pueblo-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span> (1978)--and it may be altered only by an act of Congress, see Morton, 417 U.S. at 551-52, 94 S.Ct. at 2483.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tribe has two other arrows in its jurisdictional quiver.  First, it hypothesizes that section 1708 did not survive federal recognition.  This hypothesis is the mirror image of the hypothesis just considered:  rather than being cast as the prerequisite for the conferral of jurisdiction, recognition is taken to have nullified that conferral.  The two hypotheses suffer from the same infirmity.  Tribal sovereignty (and, hence, jurisdiction) may be neither augmented nor diminished except through congressional enactment.  Second, the Tribe suggests that, if section 1708 survived recognition, it did not survive the subsequent alienation of the settlement lands.  This suggestion goes nowhere.  Supposing that the jurisdictional grant contained in section 1708 could have been jettisoned by the state, the Tribe, or the Bureau without congressional sanction--a supposition we do not share--the fact is that, at every salient moment, the parties in interest took pains to reaffirm section 1708.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We conclude, therefore, that the grant of jurisdiction contained in section 1708 of the Settlement Act was valid when made, and was undiluted at the time Congress passed the Gaming Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>B. Scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Validity notwithstanding, it is an open question whether the jurisdictional grant contained in section 1708 extends to civil regulatory jurisdiction.  The Tribe insists not.  It tells us that the enacting Congress intended to copy the distinction between civil regulatory and civil adjudicatory jurisdiction limned two years earlier in Bryan v. Itasca County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109478\"><a href=\"/opinion/109478/bryan-v-itasca-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109478\"><a href=\"/opinion/109478/bryan-v-itasca-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span> (1976).  We find this tale to be both unsupported and unsupportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tribe's argument runs along the following lines.  In its view, there are salient discrepancies in respect to jurisdiction among the J-MEM, the original Senate bill leading to the Settlement Act, and the final version of the Act itself.  To illustrate the Tribe's point, we list the three versions of the jurisdictional clause side by side, in order of drafting.  According to three documents, the settlement lands were to be subject to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>All laws of the state ... including but not limited to state and local building, fire and safety codes [J-MEM, p 13];</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>the complete civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State....  [Joint Hearing on S.3153 and H.R. 12860, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., at 36, 51 (June 20, 1978) ];</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the State....  [18 U.S.C. Sec. 1708].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analogizing to Bryan, the Tribe posits that this progression signals Congress's intent to limit the jurisdictional grant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This proposed interpretation finds no succor in the legislative history.  Without such support, we think it is evident that the Narragansetts read too much into too little.  Considering the overall context, the deviations from one document to another do not strike us as especially significant.  The progressive development of the jurisdictional language can more plausibly be interpreted as intended to clarify the breadth of the grant, rather than to narrow it.  Perhaps the drafters feared that \"all laws of the state\" might suggest regulatory jurisdiction alone, and that \"civil and criminal jurisdiction\" might imply only jurisdiction in the judicial sense.  \"Civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction\" more obviously includes all sorts of jurisdiction, and can fairly lay claim to being the broadest of the three formulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only change arguably suggesting a diminution in the scope of jurisdiction is the removal of the word \"complete\" from the draft version of the bill.  We think that this change, too, may be understood as an attempt at clarification:  the word \"complete\" could well have been removed simply to avoid any suggestion that the grant of jurisdiction was intended to be exclusive.  Cf. United States v. Cook, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553845\"><a href=\"/opinion/553845/united-states-v-roderick-alex-cook-eli-tarbell-anthony-laughing-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span>, 1032 (2d Cir.)

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></span> (1991).  For that reason, the discrepant language is at best inconclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The small changes in phraseology pinpointed by the Tribe, floated without visible means of support, place this case at considerable remove from Bryan, a case in which the Court confronted a genuinely suggestive lingual discrepancy, and interpreted the final version of the statute in line with clearly articulated legislative history.  See Bryan, 426 U.S. at 379-87, 96 S.Ct. at 2106-10.   Here, by contrast, the discrepancies that the Tribe perceives are more conjectural than suggestive;  there is absolutely nothing in the legislative history of the Settlement Act that indicates congressional intent either to limit the scope of state jurisdiction or to carve a jurisdictional distinction along civil regulatory/civil adjudicatory lines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Thus, Bryan is not a fair congener.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our assessment is reinforced by a commonsense tenet of statutory construction.  Relatively minor differences between an Indian agreement and the ratifying act of Congress needed to give it effect, without more, do not give rise to an inference that Congress intended to modify the agreement.  See Rosebud Sioux, 430 U.S. at 599, 97 S.Ct. at 1369 (holding that a 1904 act of Congress did not modify a 1901 Indian agreement, despite a suggestive minor change in language).  At least when an \"implied continuity in purpose\" exists between the antecedent agreement and the subsequently enacted statute, courts should construe the latter to effectuate the former, notwithstanding differing linguistic choices.  Id.  So it is here, for the Settlement Act was designed to implement the agreement embodied in the J-MEM.  See, e.g., 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1701(d) (declaring that the J-MEM \"requires implementing legislation\");  Joint Hearing at 97 (acknowledging that \"the legislation as drafted intends to implement the settlement agreement\") (statement of Alan R. Parker, Gen. Counsel, Sen.

Since the self-serving inference drawn by the Tribe is plainly at odds with the discernible intention undergirding the Settlement Act, and, in the bargain, plays havoc with the statutory text, we decline gratuitously to limit the scope of section 1708 in order to parallel the holding in Bryan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Cf.

Sec. 1955, because it would be inappropriate to apply a test \"developed in a different context to address different concerns\").  Hence, we conclude that the Settlement Act granted civil regulatory jurisdiction, as well as civil adjudicatory jurisdiction, to the state.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>C.

As a general matter, municipal authority is entirely derivative of state authority, see 7A R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 45-2-1 (1991);  and in the exercise of governmental powers (as opposed to proprietary powers), municipalities act only as the agents of the state, see Buckhout v. City of Newport, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></span>, 320 (R.I.1942).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows that if the state chooses to cede a portion of its sovereignty to the town, the town may use that authority to the extent of the power delegated.  See, e.g., Vukic v. Brunelle, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">609</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></span>, 941 (R.I.1992).  But delegated powers, of necessity, cannot exceed those possessed by the delegator.  The town has cited no independent basis upon which it might exercise municipal jurisdiction, and none is apparent to us.  Thus, Charlestown's concerns are necessarily subsumed in our discussion of the state's jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. THE REACH OF THE GAMING ACT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the Tribe's ultimate argument--that the Gaming Act cancels whatever jurisdiction the Settlement Act granted--we must first consider both furcula of the state's assertion that the settlement lands are specifically exempted from the Gaming Act's domain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>A. The Consensual Transfer Provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gaming Act's so-called \"consensual transfer\" provision, familiarly known as \"section 23(d),\" is the site of the next battle.  It states in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>The United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction over criminal prosecutions of violations of State gambling laws that are made applicable under this section to Indian country, unless an Indian tribe pursuant to a Tribal-State compact ... or under any other provision of Federal law, has consented to the transfer to the State of criminal jurisdiction with respect to gambling on the lands of the Indian tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. Sec. 1166(d).  This proviso, Rhode Island asseverates, presages an exemption applicable to the settlement lands.  On this theory, section 23(d) allows a state lawfully to assert civil and criminal jurisdiction over gaming under either a tribal-state compact or \"any other provision of Federal law\" that embodies a consensual transfer of jurisdiction.  And it portrays section 1708 of the Settlement Act as constituting such an agreed transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation signifies a promiscuous elevation of hope over reason, for it completely overlooks two limitations that are apparent on the face of the statute.  First, section 23(d) is a penal provision that in terms deals only with criminal prosecutions;  it has no implications for civil jurisdiction (whether regulatory or adjudicatory).  Second, section 23(d) pertains only to \"gambling,\" which is defined for purposes of that section as excluding any kind of \"gaming.\"   See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1166(c).  Thus, properly understood, section 23(d) allows states to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to a consensual transfer only to enforce criminal laws that proscribe gambling activities falling outside the sanctuary of the Gaming Act.  This is of no assistance to Rhode Island, which seeks to assert unfettered jurisdiction (including civil regulatory jurisdiction) over activities constituting class II and class III gaming.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>B.

Without meaningful citation to the Gaming Act's text, the state hawks the proposition that Congress, in passing the Act, intended to leave intact the grant of jurisdiction tendered a decade earlier in the Settlement Act.  And to fill the forensic void left by the utter absence of any statutory language to this effect, the state pushes forward carefully selected snippets of legislative history.  There are two significant problems with this approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, courts must look primarily to statutory language, not to legislative history, in determining the meaning and scope of a statute.

In a case such as this one, an inquiring court, at most, should resort to legislative history only to determine \"whether there is a 'clearly expressed legislative intention' contrary to [the statutory] language, which would require [the court] to question the strong presumption that Congress expresses its intent through the language it chooses.\"  INS v.

After careful consideration of Rhode Island's extratextual arguments, we conclude that the material it musters fails to establish such a clearly expressed legislative intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state begins this phase of its case by pointing to a preliminary version of the Gaming Act that contained a provision (former section 23) safeguarding the Settlement Act from implied repeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Once that foundation is poured, the state then brings to the forefront a colloquy on the floor of the Senate involving Rhode Island's two senators, Messrs. Pell and Chafee, and Senator Inouye, sponsor and floor manager of the bill that became the Gaming Act, regarding the eventual deletion of former section 23 from the bill:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>Mr. PELL.

Cf., e.g., Hirschey v.

It is particularly unrealistic to attribute knowledge of statements made on the Senate floor to House members, who gave their seal of approval to the Senate bill only after the Rhode Island exemption provision had been deleted, without mentioning Rhode Island's parochial concern.  See 134 Cong.Rec. H8146, H8426 (daily ed. Sept. 27, 1988) (commemorating passage by the House of Representatives).

Once Congress has spoken, it is bound by what it has plainly said, notwithstanding the nods and winks that may have been exchanged in floor debates and committee hearings.  After all, it is not the proper role of legislators to use unwritten assurances or side arrangements to alter the clear meaning of agreed language.

Any other rule imports a virulent strain of subjectivity into the interpretive task and, in the process, threatens to transfer too large a slice of legislative power from Congress to the courts.

But this patch of legislative history is also threadbare.  The Senate report speaks only to the bill as reported out of committee;  it was composed before the deletion of the special Rhode Island exemption provision, former section 23, from the final version of the bill during floor debate.

This argument stems from the language limiting the applicability of the Gaming Act's key provisions to \"[a]ny Indian tribe having jurisdiction over Indian lands,\" or, stated differently, to \"Indian lands within such tribe's jurisdiction.\"   See 25 U.S.C. Secs. 2710(d)(3)(A), 2710(b)(1).  These are dual limitations, for one element of the definition of \"Indian lands\" requires that an Indian tribe \"exercise[ ] governmental power\" over them.  25 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(4).  Rhode Island claims that the Narragansetts do not \"hav[e] jurisdiction\" over, and do not exercise \"governmental power\" with respect to, the settlement lands;  and, thus, that the Gaming Act does not pertain.  Evaluating the state's thesis requires an exploration into another aspect of congressional intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>A.

We agree.  But the mere fact that the Settlement Act cedes power to the state does not necessarily mean, as Rhode Island suggests, that the Tribe lacks similar power and, thus, lacks \"jurisdiction\" over the settlement lands.  Although the grant of jurisdictional power to the state in the Settlement Act is valid and rather broad, see supra Parts V(B), VI, we do not believe that it is exclusive.  To the contrary, we rule that the Tribe retains concurrent jurisdiction over the settlement lands and that such concurrent jurisdiction is sufficient to satisfy the corresponding precondition to applicability of the Gaming Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In undertaking the task of determining whether the Settlement Act's jurisdictional grant is exclusive in nature, it must be remembered that Indian sovereignty is \"a backdrop against which the applicable ... federal statutes must be read.\"  McClanahan v.

While tribal rights are retained at congressional sufferance and are subject to defeasance should Congress so elect, tribes retain their sovereign powers in full measure unless and until Congress acts to circumscribe them.  See United States v. Wheeler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109818\"><a href=\"/opinion/109818/united-states-v-wheeler/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 323, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109818\"><a href=\"/opinion/109818/united-states-v-wheeler/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

After all, the Court has held that retained sovereignty includes the power of Indians to make and enforce their own substantive law in internal matters, including matters such as membership rules, inheritance rules, and the regulation of domestic relations.  See Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 56, 98 S.Ct. at 1675 (citing cases).  Jurisdiction is cut from much the same fabric.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the shape of retained sovereignty has never been precisely defined.  Thus, it cannot be said with assurance whether or not criminal, civil adjudicatory, and civil regulatory jurisdiction, in whole cloth, are aspects of retained sovereignty.  But we have no need today to map such far-flung frontiers.  For present purposes, so long as the portion of jurisdiction encompassed within the natural rights of the Narragansetts is substantial enough to satisfy the Gaming Act's \"having jurisdiction\" prong, our inquiry is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state has not contended that any treaty impinges upon the Tribe's jurisdiction.  By like token, the record will not support a finding of jurisdiction abandoned or lost through implicit divestiture, see Wheeler, 435 U.S. at 326, 98 S.Ct. at 1087.   We are left, then, with the relatively confined question of whether the Tribe's retained jurisdiction has been forfeited by statute.  It is against this backdrop that we focus the lens of our inquiry on the Settlement Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Settlement Act.   By its terms, the Settlement Act purposes to do no more than grant jurisdiction to the state;  it does not expressly strip the Tribe of jurisdiction, transfer jurisdiction from the Tribe to the state, or employ suggestive adjectives like \"exclusive\" or \"complete\" in describing the jurisdictional grant.  The omission of the word \"exclusive\" looms particularly large in light of the use of that word elsewhere.  For instance, the word is used to modify the general jurisdictional grant in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1162 (1988), one of the few analogous statutes granting \"civil and criminal jurisdiction\" over Indian lands to an individual state.  Even more tellingly, the word is used in the Settlement Act itself, which characterizes as \"exclusive\" the grant to federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain certain constitutional challenges.  25 U.S.C. Sec. 1711.  This phenomenon commands our utmost attention, for where \"Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\"  Rodriguez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111840\"><a href=\"/opinion/111840/rodriguez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 525, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111840\"><a href=\"/opinion/111840/rodriguez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At least one other court has found the omission of words such as \"exclusive\" or \"complete\" in a similar context to be meaningful.  See Cook, 922 F.2d at 1026, 1032-33 (concluding from the omission of any such language that a grant to New York of jurisdiction over Indian lands, embodied in 25 U.S.C. Sec. 232, is non-exclusive).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparative analysis is also instructive.  We think it is sensible to compare the jurisdictional grant embedded in the Settlement Act with the jurisdictional grants encased in two other Indian claims settlement acts that were to some extent modeled after the Settlement Act.  Both of the latter pieces of legislation--one involving Massachusetts, one involving Maine--contain grants of jurisdiction parallel to section 1708, expressed in similar language.  See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1771g (1988);  25 U.S.C. Sec. 1725 (1988).  Yet both acts also contain corresponding limits on Indian jurisdiction, conspicuously absent from the Settlement Act.  See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1771e(a);  25 U.S.C. Sec. 1725(f).  By placing stated limits on the retained jurisdiction of the affected tribes, these newer acts imply that an unadorned grant of jurisdiction to a state--such as is embodied in the Settlement Act--does not in and of itself imply exclusivity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find these factors to be of decretory significance.  Given the strong congressional bias, especially noticeable in the past generation, against policies that would promote Indian assimilation, see Bryan, 426 U.S. at 387-88 &amp; n. 14, 96 S.Ct. at 2110-11 &amp; n. 14, and also given Congress's fortunate penchant for great clarity when expressing its intent in this area, see id. at 389, 96 S.Ct. at 2111 (\"Congress kn[ows] well how to express its intent directly when that intent [is] to subject ... Indians to the full sweep of state laws.\");  Mattz v. Arnett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108812\"><a href=\"/opinion/108812/mattz-v-arnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span>, 504 n. 22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108812\"><a href=\"/opinion/108812/mattz-v-arnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span> (1973) (observing that Congress generally employs \"clear language of express termination when that result is desired\") (collecting examples), we are of the view that acts diminishing the sovereign rights of Indian tribes should be strictly construed.  So here.  Since the Settlement Act does not unequivocally articulate an intent to deprive the Tribe of jurisdiction, we hold that its grant of jurisdiction to the state is non-exclusive.  The Narragansetts, therefore, have made the necessary threshold showing.  They retain that portion of jurisdiction they possess by virtue of their sovereign existence as a people--a portion sufficient to satisfy the Gaming Act's \"having jurisdiction\" prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>B.

Meeting this requirement does not depend upon the Tribe's theoretical authority, but upon the presence of concrete manifestations of that authority.  Consequently, an inquiring court must assay the jurisdictional history of the settlement lands.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Cf., e.g., DeCoteau v.

In the post-recognition period, the Tribe has taken many strides in the direction of self-government.  It has established a housing authority, recognized as eligible to participate in the Indian programs of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, see 24 C.F.R., Part 905 (1993).  It has obtained status as the functional equivalent of a state for purposes of the Clean Water Act, after having been deemed by the Environmental Protection Agency as having \"a governing body carrying out substantial governmental duties and powers,\" 33 U.S.C. Sec. 1377(e) (1988), and as being capable of administering an effective program of water regulation, see 40 C.F.R. Sec. 130.6(d) (1993).  It has taken considerable advantage of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA), a statute specifically designed to help build \"strong and stable tribal governments.\"  25 U.S.C. Sec. 450a(b) (1988).  The Tribe administers health care programs under an ISDA pact with the Indian Health Service, and, under ISDA contracts with the Bureau, administers programs encompassing job training, education, community services, social services, real estate protection, conservation, public safety, and the like.  These activities adequately evince that the Tribe exercises more than enough governmental power to satisfy the second prong of the statutory test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IX. THE INTERFACE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have concluded that the settlement lands, under the Tribe's auspices, meet both prerequisites of the Gaming Act, those lands are subject to the Act's benefits and burdens.  The task remaining is to determine how the Gaming Act and the Settlement Act operate in tandem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>A.

The doctrine of preemption is derived from the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const., Art.  VI, cl. 2, and therefore applies only to conflicts between federal provisions, on one hand, and state or local provisions, on the other hand.  See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112777\"><a href=\"/opinion/112777/cipollone-v-liggett-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span> (1992).  The proper mode of analysis for cases that involve a perceived conflict between two federal statutes is that of implied repeal.  See Cook, 922 F.2d at 1033 (rejecting preemption analysis as inappropriate in resolving a conflict between the Gaming Act and an earlier federal statute);  see also 1A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland on Stat.  Const. Sec. 23.09 (5th ed. 1993).  Hence, we follow that analytic path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by reiterating the bedrock principle that implied repeals of federal statutes are disfavored.  In the absence of a contrary legislative command, when two acts of Congress touch upon the same subject matter the courts should give effect to both, if that is feasible.  See Pipefitters Local 562 v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108586\"><a href=\"/opinion/108586/pipefitters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 432 n. 43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108586\"><a href=\"/opinion/108586/pipefitters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In other words, so long as the two statutes, fairly construed, are capable of coexistence, courts should regard each as effective.  See Traynor v.

Applying the Principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident that the Settlement Act and the Gaming Act are partially but not wholly repugnant.  The Settlement Act assigned the state a number of rights.  Among those rights--and by no means one of the rights at the epicenter of the negotiations leading up to the Act--was the non-exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction, in all customary respects save two, see supra note 6, over the settlement lands.  The Gaming Act leaves undisturbed the key elements of the compromise embodied in the Settlement Act.  It also leaves largely intact the grant of jurisdiction--but it demands an adjustment of that portion of jurisdiction touching on gaming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in respect to jurisdiction over gaming, the two laws do not collide head-on.  Thus, in connection with class III gaming, the Gaming Act does not in itself negate the state's jurisdiction, but, instead, channels the state's jurisdiction through the tribal-state compact process.  It is only with regard to class I and class II gaming that the Gaming Act ex proprio vigore bestows exclusive jurisdiction on qualifying tribes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  And it is only to these small degrees that the Gaming Act properly may be said to have worked a partial repeal by implication of the preexisting statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the area in which the two laws clash, the Gaming Act trumps the Settlement Act for two reasons.  First, the general rule is that where two acts are in irreconcilable conflict, the later act prevails to the extent of the impasse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  See Watt v. Alaska, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110466\"><a href=\"/opinion/110466/watt-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 266, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110466\"><a href=\"/opinion/110466/watt-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Second, in keeping with the spirit of the standards governing implied repeals, courts should endeavor to read antagonistic statutes together in the manner that will minimize the aggregate disruption of congressional intent.  Here, reading the two statutes to restrict state jurisdiction over gaming honors the Gaming Act and, at the same time, leaves the heart of the Settlement Act untouched.  Taking the opposite tack--reading the two statutes in such a way as to defeat tribal jurisdiction over gaming on the settlement lands--would honor the Settlement Act, but would do great violence to the essential structure and purpose of the Gaming Act.  Because the former course keeps disruption of congressional intent to a bare minimum, that reading is to be preferred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our understanding of the statutory interface, we hold that the provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act apply with full force to the lands in Rhode Island now held in trust by the United States for the Narragansett Indian Tribe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p>C.

While the Tribe retains all aspects of its retained sovereignty, as that term is commonly comprehended in our jurisprudence, Congress, after having granted to the state non-exclusive jurisdiction over the settlement lands via the Settlement Act, impliedly withdrew from that grant, via the Gaming Act, the state's jurisdiction over gaming.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Yet, the withdrawal of jurisdiction over gaming cannot be interpreted to signify a withdrawal of all residual jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This means that the state continues to possess a quantum of regulatory authority.  Of course, any effort by the state to exercise this residual authority is hedged in by barriers on both sides:  on one side, by the Tribe's retained rights of sovereignty;  on the other side, by the Tribe's congressionally approved authority over a specific subject matter, namely, gaming.  Testing the sturdiness of one or the other of these barriers in a given case will require \"a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake.\"  White Mountain Apache Tribe v.

We cannot undertake such an inquiry in the abstract, and, thus, the jurisdictional status of the settlement lands remains ill-defined in certain respects.

The crucial questions which must yet be answered principally deal with the nature of the regulable activities which may--or may not--be subject to state control, e.g., zoning, traffic control, advertising, lodging.  It is true that nondiscriminatory burdens imposed on the activities of non-Indians on Indian lands are generally upheld.  See, e.g., Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110295\"><a href=\"/opinion/110295/washington-v-confederated-tribes-of-colville-reservation/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 151, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110295\"><a href=\"/opinion/110295/washington-v-confederated-tribes-of-colville-reservation/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span> (1980) (discussing tax burdens).  But it is also true that a comprehensive federal regulatory scheme governing a particular area typically leaves no room for additional state burdens in that area.  See White Mountain Apache Tribe, 448 U.S. at 148, 100 S.Ct. at 2586 (finding state timber regulation to be preempted).  Which activities are deemed regulable, therefore, will probably depend, in the first instance, on which activities are deemed integral to gaming.  Although the core functions of class III gaming on the settlement land are beyond Rhode Island's unilateral reach, the distinction between core functions and peripheral functions is tenebrous, as is the question of exactly what Rhode Island may and may not do with respect to those functions that eventually are determined to be peripheral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If these criss-crossing lines prove agonizingly difficult to decipher, let alone to administer, they \"are no more or less so than many of the classifications that pervade the law of Indian jurisdiction.\"  Washington v.

We add, however, that although our opinion today answers some questions and raises others, we do not mean to encourage the protagonists to litigate ad infinitum.   The parties' baseline power need not be defined with exactitude by judicial decree where, as here, they are compelled to enter negotiations out of which will emerge a new balance of power.  The next step in the allocation of jurisdiction over gaming is in the hands of the parties, through negotiations designed to produce a tribal-state compact as contemplated by the Gaming Act, see 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2710(d).

The rule is that, generally, there can be no partial implied repeal absent repugnancy.   This is simply another way of stating that congressional intent to substitute a later act for an earlier one will ordinarily be implied only if the later act usurps the whole ground occupied by the first.  See Posadas, 296 U.S. at 504, 56 S.Ct. at 352.   If repugnancy is found, however, then a partial repeal is in most cases preferred--indeed, mandated--for only that part of the earlier statute which is plainly anathematic should be nullified</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> We take no view on whether, apart from the Gaming Act, a state might have regulated the activities that comprise class I gaming without violating the Free Exercise Clause</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The state argues that the Settlement Act should prevail because it is the more specific statute.

More fundamentally, the canon upon which the state relies is rooted in the presumption that, when legislatures enact general laws, they do not have in mind every preexisting statute that touches on some specific aspect of the general subject.

Sec. 1609(c), preempted a conflicting Massachusetts statute.  The text of Sec. 13(c) did not answer this question.  Our close examination of the legislative history, however, persuaded us that Congress did not intend for this statute to preempt conflicting Massachusetts law</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
