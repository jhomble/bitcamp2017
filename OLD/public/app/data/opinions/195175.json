The  sole  issue  on this\n                               \n\nappeal is whether  a three-year, or a  fifteen-year, statute\n\nof limitations applies to plaintiff's claims.  We agree with\n\nthe  district court  that  a  fifteen-year statute  applies.\n\nAnd,  we  affirm  its  grant  of  summary  judgment for  the\n\nplaintiff.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          The  parties agree  about all the  relevant facts.\n\nIn 1981, the  plaintiff, Georgia Pacific Corp.,  promised to\n\npay  the defendant,  Pablo Eguia  &amp; Sons,  a commission  for\n\nfinding retailers  who would  sell the  plaintiff's bathroom\n\ntissue in Puerto Rico.  The defendant, as an \"inducement\" to\n\nthe  plaintiff to enter into the  contract, promised that it\n\nwould  \"guaranty\"  the retailers'  consequent  \"payment[s].\"\n\nAnd, it entered into a  Guaranty Agreement that spelled  out\n\nthe details.\n\n          Apparently, over the years,  certain retailers did\n\nnot pay for bathroom tissue that they bought.  And, in 1991,\n\nthe plaintiff brought this diversity action in Puerto Rico's\n\nfederal  district  court  to  collect  on   the  defendant's\n\nguarantee.    The  only  meaningful  defense  concerned  the\n\nstatute  of limitations.  Defendant argued that a three-year\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nstatute of limitations applied, in which case (the plaintiff\n\nconcedes) it would bar the  plaintiff's $214,000 claim.  The\n\nplaintiff argued,  however, that  a different,  fifteen-year\n\nstatute of limitations  applied to its claim,  in which case\n\n(the defendant concedes) the claim is not time-barred.   The\n\ndistrict court, finding the fifteen-year statute applicable,\n\ngranted  summary  judgment  for  the  plaintiff.   Defendant\n\nappeals.   We agree with the plaintiff that the fifteen-year\n\nstatute applies.  \n\n                             II\n\n                          Analysis\n                                  \n\n          The  defendant  rests  its  \"three year\"  argument\n\nprimarily  upon  two provisions  of  Puerto  Rico's Commerce\n\nCode.  The first says:\n\n               The liability of  . . .  commercial\n                                                  \n          brokers  . .  .  in  the obligations  in\n                                                  \n          which  they take part by reason of their\n                                                  \n          office  shall   prescribe  after   three\n                \n          years.\n\n10 (App. I) L.P.R.A.   1904  (Article 942) (emphasis added).\n\nThe second provision says:\n\n               Actions arising  from drafts  shall\n                                           \n          extinguish     three     years     after\n          maturity . . . . \n               A similar rule shall be applied  to\n          commercial   bills   of   exchange   and\n                                                  \n          promissory  notes,  checks,   stubs  and\n                                                  \n          other instruments of draft or exchange .\n                                                \n          . . .\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n10  (App. I) L.P.R.A.   1908 (Article 946) (emphasis added).\n\nIf either of these provisions applies, the plaintiff's claim\n\nis barred.\n\n          Unfortunately for the  defendant, neither of these\n\nprovisions applies.   The  first provision  does not  govern\n\nbecause, whether or not the defendant acted as a \"commercial\n\nbroker,\" one cannot fairly characterize the  obligation upon\n                                                       \n\nwhich the  plaintiff is now suing as a \"commercial broker's\"\n\nobligation.     Rather,   that  obligation  is   a  guaranty\n                                                            \n\nobligation,  and the defendant, in guaranteeing the debts of\n\nanother, acts as a  surety, not as a commercial broker.  See\n                                                            \n\n31  L.P.R.A.     4871  (Article  1721  of  the  Civil  Code)\n\n(defining surety as \"a person  [who] binds himself to pay or\n\nperform for a third person in case the latter should fail to\n\ndo so\").   The fact that the defendant  offered the guaranty\n\nas  an   \"inducement\"  to   obtain   an  (exclusive)   sales\n\nrepresentation arrangement makes no  difference.  One  might\n\noffer all sorts of promises as inducements to obtain such an\n\narrangement -- say, a promise to sell a private home, or the\n\nfamily silver,  or a  car.  But,  we should  normally expect\n\nthat the nature of the promise, not the promisor's  motives,\n\ndetermines  the  appropriate  prescriptive provision.    One\n\nwould  normally expect,  for example, that  the prescription\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nprovisions  applicable to  real  estate contracts,  not some\n\nother  provisions, govern  a promise  to  sell real  estate,\n\nirrespective of the reason why the  owner wants to sell.  We\n                          \n\nhave  found nothing  in the  codes,  commentators, or  cases\n\nsuggesting the contrary.\n\n          The  second  provision   (referring  to  \"drafts,\"\n\n\"commercial   bills   of  exchange,\"   \"promissory   notes,\"\n\n\"checks,\"  \"stubs,\"  and  \"other  instruments  of  draft  or\n\nexchange\")   does   not   apply   because  its   \"three-year\n\nprescription   bars   actions    arising   from   negotiable\n                                                            \n\ninstruments.\"   5  R. Gay  de Montella,  Codigo de  Comercio\n           \n\nEspanol  Comentado 503-04  (1936) (describing  corresponding\n\nprovision  in  Spanish Code  of  Commerce)  (translated, and\n\nquoted,  in Portilla  v.  Banco Popular  de Puerto  Rico, 75\n                                                        \n\nP.R.R.  94, 119  (1953)) (emphasis  added).   A  \"negotiable\n\ninstrument\"  is  a financial  instrument  that, among  other\n\nthings, embodies an \"unconditional promise or order to pay a\n\nsum  certain.\"    19  L.P.R.A.     2  (defining  \"negotiable\n\ninstrument[]\");  see also  id.    361 (defining  \"promissory\n                             \n\nnote\" similarly);  id.    221 (defining  \"bill of  exchange\"\n                     \n\nsimilarly); id.   362 (defining \"check\" as a kind of bill of\n              \n\nexchange).   The promise before us --  one of guaranty -- is\n\nplainly   not  a   negotiable  instrument;  it   is  neither\n             \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n\"unconditional\"  (for  it  is  conditioned  on  the debtor's\n\ndefault),  nor is it for a \"sum certain\" (for it promises to\n\npay only to the extent the debtor defaults).\n\n          What, then, is the  proper prescription period for\n                        \n\na  promise of  guaranty under  Puerto Rico  law?   The Fifth\n\nCircuit,  applying  Louisiana's civil  law system,  tells us\n\nthat \"the limitations period that applies in  a suit against\n\na surety is normally the same as that which applies to suits\n\nagainst the principal  debtor for payment of  the underlying\n\ndebt.\"   Browning Seed, Inc.  v. Bayles, 812 F.2d  999, 1002\n                                       \n\n(5th Cir. 1987)  (citation omitted).  This  Circuit has held\n\nthe same  in  respect to  Puerto Rico's  law.   See FDIC  v.\n                                                        \n\nConsolidated Mortgage  &amp; Fin.  Corp., 805  F.2d 14,  20 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1986) (prescription period for guarantee  of promissory\n\nnote given by prescription period for underlying  promissory\n\nnote);  see also  FDIC v.  Barrera,  595 F.  Supp. 894,  898\n                                  \n\n(D.P.R. 1984) (Torruella,  C.J.) (same).  Barrera,  on which\n                                                 \n\nConsolidated Mortgage relied, noted that Puerto Rico's Civil\n                     \n\nCode says  that  the  \"obligation[s]\"  of  a  surety  (or  a\n\nguarantor) \"expire\" at the same time as those of the debtor.\n\n31 L.P.R.A.    4951  (Article 1746 of  the Civil  Code); see\n                                                            \n\nalso  10  (App. I)  L.P.R.A.     1824  (Article 352  of  the\n    \n\nCommerce Code) (\"obligations\" of a surety \"continue in force\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nuntil  .  . .  the  complete  termination  of the  principal\n\ncontract which is secured\").  And, from that fact, the court\n\nreasoned that  the same prescription period normally applies\n\nas well.\n\n          Consistent with  this rule, defendant, in  a post-\n\nargument brief,  now seems  to acknowledge  that its  appeal\n\nsucceeds or fails depending upon whether or not an action on\n\nthe underlying debts guaranteed, those of the retailers, are\n\nthemselves  time-barred.   That being  so,  its appeal  must\n\nfail.  That is because the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico  has\n\nheld,  at least  twice, that  the  prescription period  that\n\napplies to  a reseller's  promise to pay  a supplier  is the\n\nCivil  Code's  fifteen-year  \"catch  all\"   provision  --  a\n                           \n\nprovision that applies to \"personal\" actions for which other\n\ncodes  specify  \"no  special  term  of  prescription.\"    31\n\nL.P.R.A.    5294 (Article 1864); see Ramallo Bros.

This provision does not\n\napply  here because supplier and retailer are both \"traders\"\n\nand  both are  engaged in  the same,  not in  a \"different,\"\n\ntrade.   See Davila,  58 P.R.R. at  884 (\"The  trade [i]n  a\n                   \n\nspecific [commodity]  is the  same whether  at wholesale  or\n\nretail . . . .\").  \n\n          It may seem somewhat anomalous, as the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme  Court itself has noted, that the limitations period\n\napplicable to  merchants  in the  same business  is so  much\n\nlonger than that applicable to those in different businesses\n\nor to non-traders.  See Ramallo  Bros., 93 J.T.S. at 86 (\"We\n                                      \n\nare dealing with  a situation which strays from  the guiding\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nobservation  that,   as  a  general   rule,  the  mercantile\n\nprescriptive terms  are much  shorter than  in the  civil in\n\nkeeping  with  the  peculiar   demands  of  the   commercial\n\ntraffic.\")  (citations  omitted).     It  may  be,   as  one\n\ncommentator suggests, that same-business traders tend to pay\n\ntheir bills to each other less promptly than do others.  See\n                                                            \n\nPicazo, supra, at 215.  But, anomalous or not, we follow the\n             \n\nSupreme Court  of Puerto Rico, which follows the language of\n\nthe Code.\n\n          For these reasons, this action is not time-barred.\n\nThere being no other significant  legal issue before us, the\n\njudgment of  the district  court, requiring  payment of  the\n\nguaranteed amounts, is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n",

Defendant argued that a three-year statute of limitations applied, in which case (the plaintiff concedes) it would bar the plaintiff's $214,000 claim.  The plaintiff argued, however, that a different, fifteen-year statute of limitations applied to its claim, in which case (the defendant concedes) the claim is not time-barred.  The district court, finding the fifteen-year statute applicable, granted summary judgment for the plaintiff.  822 F.Supp. 46 (D.P.R.1993).  Defendant appeals.  We agree with the plaintiff that the fifteen-year statute applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant rests its \"three year\" argument primarily upon two provisions of Puerto Rico's Commerce Code.  The first says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liability of ... commercial brokers ... in the obligations in which they take part by reason of their office shall prescribe after three years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10 (App.  I) L.P.R.A. Sec. 1904 (Article 942) (emphasis added).  The second provision says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Actions arising from drafts shall extinguish three years after maturity....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar rule shall be applied to commercial bills of exchange and promissory notes, checks, stubs and other instruments of draft or exchange....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10 (App.  I) L.P.R.A. Sec. 1908 (Article 946) (emphasis added).  If either of these provisions applies, the plaintiff's claim is barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for the defendant, neither of these provisions applies.  The first provision does not govern because, whether or not the defendant acted as a \"commercial broker,\" one cannot fairly characterize the obligation upon which the plaintiff is now suing as a \"commercial broker's\" obligation.  Rather, that obligation is a guaranty obligation, and the defendant, in guaranteeing the debts of another, acts as a surety, not as a commercial broker.  See 31 L.P.R.A. Sec. 4871 (Article 1721 of the Civil Code) (defining surety as \"a person [who] binds himself to pay or perform for a third person in case the latter should fail to do so\").  The fact that the defendant offered the guaranty as an \"inducement\" to obtain an (exclusive) sales representation arrangement makes no difference.  One might offer all sorts of promises as inducements to obtain such an arrangement--say, a promise to sell a private home, or the family silver, or a car.  But, we should normally expect that the nature of the promise, not the promisor's motives, determines the appropriate prescriptive provision.  One would normally expect, for example, that the prescription provisions applicable to real estate contracts, not some other provisions, govern a promise to sell real estate, irrespective of the reason why the owner wants to sell.  We have found nothing in the codes, commentators, or cases suggesting the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second provision (referring to \"drafts,\" \"commercial bills of exchange,\" \"promissory notes,\" \"checks,\" \"stubs,\" and \"other instruments of draft or exchange\") does not apply because its \"three-year prescription bars actions arising from negotiable instruments.\"   5 R. Gay de Montella, Codigo de Comercio Espanol Comentado 503-04 (1936) (describing corresponding provision in Spanish Code of Commerce) (translated, and quoted, in Portilla v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 75 P.R.R. 94, 119 (1953)) (emphasis added).  A \"negotiable instrument\" is a financial instrument that, among other things, embodies an \"unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain.\"  19 L.P.R.A. Sec. 2 (defining \"negotiable instrument[ ]\");  see also id. Sec. 361 (defining \"promissory note\" similarly);  id. Sec. 221 (defining \"bill of exchange\" similarly);  id. Sec. 362 (defining \"check\" as a kind of bill of exchange).  The promise before us--one of guaranty--is plainly not a negotiable instrument;  it is neither \"unconditional\" (for it is conditioned on the debtor's default), nor is it for a \"sum certain\" (for it promises to pay only to the extent the debtor defaults).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What, then, is the proper prescription period for a promise of guaranty under Puerto Rico law?   The Fifth Circuit, applying Louisiana's civil law system, tells us that \"the limitations period that applies in a suit against a surety is normally the same as that which applies to suits against the principal debtor for payment of the underlying debt.\"  Browning Seed, Inc. v. Bayles, 812 F.2d 999, 1002 (5th Cir.1987) (citation omitted).  This Circuit has held the same in respect to Puerto Rico's law.  See FDIC v. Consolidated Mortgage &amp; Fin.  Corp., 805 F.2d 14, 20 (1st Cir.1986) (prescription period for guarantee of promissory note given by prescription period for underlying promissory note);  see also FDIC v. Barrera, 595 F.Supp. 894, 898 (D.P.R.1984) (Torruella, C.J.)  (same).  Barrera, on which Consolidated Mortgage relied, noted that Puerto Rico's Civil Code says that the \"obligation[s]\" of a surety (or a guarantor) \"expire\" at the same time as those of the debtor.  31 L.P.R.A. Sec. 4951 (Article 1746 of the Civil Code);  see also 10 (App.  I) L.P.R.A. Sec. 1824 (Article 352 of the Commerce Code) (\"obligations\" of a surety \"continue in force until ... the complete termination of the principal contract which is secured\").  And, from that fact, the court reasoned that the same prescription period normally applies as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with this rule, defendant, in a post-argument brief, now seems to acknowledge that its appeal succeeds or fails depending upon whether or not an action on the underlying debts guaranteed, those of the retailers, are themselves time-barred.  That being so, its appeal must fail.  That is because the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held, at least twice, that the prescription period that applies to a reseller's promise to pay a supplier is the Civil Code's fifteen-year \"catch all\" provision--a provision that applies to \"personal\" actions for which other codes specify \"no special term of prescription.\"  31 L.P.R.A. Sec. 5294 (Article 1864);  see Ramallo Bros. Printing, Inc. v. Guillermo Ramis, 93 J.T.S. 84 (1993) (applying fifteen-year \"catch all\" provision to advertising company that bought, for resale to its clients, business cards and the like from a printer);  Davila v. Torres, 58 P.R.R. 880 (1941) (same for retail grocer that bought produce from wholesale grocer);  see also Fernando Sanchez Calero, Institutions of Business Law 448 (13th ed. 1988) (\"The prescriptive term of the seller's right to pay[ment] ... in the sale for resale is ... fifteen years....\") (citation omitted) (translation supplied in Supplemental Appendix);  Luis Diez Picazo, Prescription in the Civil Code 214 (1964) (same) (translation supplied in Supplemental Appendix).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has rejected one other prescription provision that we have not yet mentioned, namely a provision in the Civil Code that sets a three-year prescriptive term for</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>the payment ... to traders for the value of goods sold to others who are not traders, or who, being such, are engaged in a different trade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">31 L.P.R.A. Sec. 5297 (Article 1867).  This provision does not apply here because supplier and retailer are both \"traders\" and both are engaged in the same, not in a \"different,\" trade.

See Ramallo Bros., 93 J.T.S. at 86 (\"We are dealing with a situation which strays from the guiding observation that, as a general rule, the mercantile prescriptive terms are much shorter than in the civil in keeping with the peculiar demands of the commercial traffic.\")  (citations omitted).  It may be, as one commentator suggests, that same-business traders tend to pay their bills to each other less promptly than do others.  See Picazo, supra, at 215.

In 1981, the plaintiff, Georgia Pacific Corp., promised to pay the defendant, Pablo Eguia &amp; Sons, a commission for finding retailers who would sell the plaintiff's bathroom tissue in Puerto Rico.  The defendant, as an \"inducement\" to the plaintiff to enter into the contract, promised that it would \"guaranty\" the retailers' consequent \"payment[s].\"  And, it entered into a Guaranty Agreement that spelled out the details.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently, over the years, certain retailers did not pay for bathroom tissue that they bought.
