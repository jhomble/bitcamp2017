Michael A. Ponsor,         U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                 Torruella, Lipez and Thompson,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bernard Moore on brief pro se.\n     Daryl J. Lapp, Robert G. Young and Edwards Angell Palmer &\nDodge LLP, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           February 28, 2011\n\f            Per Curiam.       Bernard Moore has appealed the judgment of\n\nthe district court dismissing his complaint.1               We review, de novo,\n\na district court's grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to\n\nstate a claim.     IOM Corp. v. Brown Forman Corp., 627 F.3d 440, 446\n\n(1st Cir. 2010).     Upon de novo review, we affirm essentially for\n\nthe reasons stated in the district court's memorandum and order,\n\ndated April 7, 2010.\n\n            We add only the following:\n\n(1)         We   deem,   as    waived,     Moore's      claims    of       breach   of\n\nemployment contract, wrongful termination, and violation of tenant\n\nrights as he has failed to make any developed argument as to them.\n\nSee United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(reciting   that   \"issues      adverted     to   in   a    perfunctory       manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived\").\n\n(2)         The only claim pursued on appeal is Moore's request for\n\ninjunctive relief permitting him to acquire continuation of health\n\ninsurance    coverage     under    the       Comprehensive       Omnibus       Budget\n\nReconciliation     Act    of    1985   (COBRA),        29   U.S.C.     §    1161(a).\n\nPresumably, he is asking that Williams College be directed to\n\n\n\n      1\n      We have consolidated Moore's appeal from the denial of a\npreliminary injunction (Appeal No. 10-1337) with his appeal from\nthe dismissal of his complaint (Appeal No. 10-1501). The denial of\nthe preliminary injunction has merged in the final judgment, see\nChaparro-Febus v. Local 1575, 983 F.2d 325, 331 n.5 (1st Cir.\n1993), and so we need not address it separately.\n\n                                       -2-\n\frescind its characterization of his actions as \"gross misconduct\"\n\nthat has statutorily barred his eligibility.      See 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1161(a) (requiring a plan sponsor to provide that a qualified\n\nbeneficiary that loses coverage as a result of a qualifying event\n\nis entitled to elect, within the election period, continuation\n\ncoverage); § 1163(2) (excluding termination for gross misconduct\n\nfrom the definition of qualifying event).    As Moore is currently\n\nincarcerated, it appears that the only claim pursued on appeal is\n\nnow moot as he no longer has any need for COBRA-provided health\n\ncare coverage.\n\n(3)       In any event, assuming, without deciding, that the appeal\n\nis not moot, it is meritless.    Moore contends that the district\n\ncourt erred in determining that his actions that resulted in his\n\ntermination constituted \"gross misconduct\" for purposes of COBRA\n\ncoverage because, he argues, he did not engage in gross misconduct\n\nwhile employed at Williams College from July 2008 to November 2009.\n\nMoore offers no persuasive authority for his contention that that\n\nwhich constitutes \"gross misconduct\" is limited to the period of\n\none's employment.   While the two cases he cites involved instances\n\nof gross misconduct alleged to have occurred during a period of\n\nemployment, see Kariotis v. Navistar Int'l. Transp. Corp., 131 F.3d\n\n672 (7th Cir. 1997); Richard v. Industrial Commercial Elec. Corp.,\n\n337 F.Supp. 2d 279 (D. Mass. 2004), they do not support the\n\ncontention that an employer is permitted to terminate an employee\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fonly for instances of gross misconduct that occurred during the\n\nperiod of employment.      We need not determine whether that which\n\nconstitutes \"gross misconduct\" for purposes of the COBRA provision\n\nis limited to the period of employment.      Even assuming that \"gross\n\nmisconduct\" is limited to the period of employment, Moore has no\n\neffective answer to the district court's characterization of his\n\nconcealment and misrepresentation of his credentials during the\n\nperiod of employment at Williams College as constituting \"gross\n\nmisconduct.\"2       Upon   de   novo   review,   we   agree   with   this\n\ncharacterization and find no error.\n\n          The judgment of the district court entered on April 7,\n\n2010 is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The fact that the district court assumed in Moore's favor\nthat he did not commit any crimes while actively employed by\nWilliams effectively resolves Moore's misdirected (and, it appears,\nlegally incorrect) arguments that (a) the district court should not\ntake judicial notice of the filings in his criminal case and (b)\nhis guilty plea was not the equivalent of a \"conviction.\"       See\nKowalski v. Gagne, 914 F.2d 299, 305 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is well-\naccepted that federal courts may take judicial notice of\nproceedings in other courts if those proceedings have relevance to\nthe matters at hand\"); Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220,\n223 (1927) (reciting that a guilty plea \"is itself a conviction\").\n\n                                   -4-\n\f",
