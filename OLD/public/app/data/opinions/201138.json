(\"Travelers\") appeals from the district\n\ncourt's denial of its motion to partially stay or dismiss the class\n\naction as to certain class members under the Federal Arbitration\n\nAct, 9 U.S.C. § 1-16.      The district found Travelers had waived by\n\nits conduct any arbitration rights it had.              We have jurisdiction\n\nover this interlocutory appeal under 9 U.S.C. § 16.                We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           Plaintiff William Lomas (\"Lomas\") filed a class action in\n\nConnecticut Superior Court in March 2000 on behalf of all former\n\nConnecticut   employees     of   Salomon     Smith   Barney,      Inc.   (\"SSB\");\n\nSalomon Smith Barney Holdings, Inc.; Travelers Group, Inc.; and all\n\nsubsidiaries thereof.1      The case was removed to the United States\n\nDistrict   Court   for     the   District      of    Connecticut,        and   was\n\nconsolidated and transferred, along with eleven other actions, to\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\npursuant to   an   order    of   the    Judicial     Panel   on   Multidistrict\n\nLitigation (\"MDL\").        The underlying claims in the consolidated\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Defendants in this case are Citigroup, Inc.; Travelers Group,\nInc.; Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.; and Salomon Smith Barney\nHoldings, Inc. Until 1998, Salomon Smith Barney Holdings, Inc.,\nthe parent of Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., was a subsidiary of\nTravelers Group, Inc. In 1998, Travelers Group, Inc. merged with\nCiticorp, Inc. to form Citigroup, Inc., the successor in interest\nto Travelers Group.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fcases challenge the legality of the forfeiture provisions of the\n\nCapital Accumulation Plan sponsored by Travelers.2\n\n            The district court granted class certification on October\n\n26, 2001.    The class was defined as\n\n            [a]ll former employees of Citigroup, Salomon\n            Smith Barney, Travelers Group, Inc. or related\n            and affiliated companies in Connecticut who\n            participated in the Capital Accumulation Plan\n            of Citigroup, Inc., Travelers Group, Inc.,\n            Travelers, Inc., and/or Primerica Corporation\n            who resigned or who were terminated on or\n            after March 13, 1994 and as a consequence lost\n            the right to receive shares of stock and/or\n            options and/or other earned income under the\n            terms of the plan upon termination.\n\nOn July 23, 2002, the district court granted Travelers's motion to\n\namend their answer to assert their right to arbitrate as an\n\naffirmative defense.\n\n            The class as certified included employees both who were\n\nsubject to arbitration and those who were not.   Some members of the\n\nclass were excluded from arbitration because they were members of\n\nthe National Association of Securities Dealers (\"NASD\").     That is\n\nbecause under NASD rules, a claim submitted as a class action\n\n\"shall not be eligible for arbitration,\" nor may a member of NASD\n\n\n2\n   The plan provides covered employees with the opportunity to\nreceive a portion of their earnings in awards of restricted stock\nin lieu of commissions.       Other employees are required to\nparticipate in the plan and receive the stock as part of their\nannual discretionary bonus. The awards are subject to two or three\nyear vesting periods as well as forfeiture of non-vested stock if\nthe plan participant terminates his or her employment. The class\naction challenges the plan's vesting and forfeiture provisions\nunder Connecticut law.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fseek to enforce an arbitration agreement against another member who\n\ninitiated a class action.     See NASD Unif. Code of Arbitration §\n\n10301(d).    This meant that neither Lomas himself or those class\n\nmembers subject to NASD rules could be compelled to arbitrate. But\n\nthe former Travelers employees who were within the class were not\n\nNASD members, nor was Travelers.   Travelers argued that this group\n\ncould be compelled to arbitrate their claims.\n\n            On May 5, 2003, Travelers moved pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 3\n\nto partially stay or dismiss the litigation as to any class members\n\nwho had arbitrable claims asserted on their behalf by William\n\nLomas, the lead plaintiff.   The district court held that Travelers\n\nhad waived its right to arbitration and denied the motion.3\n\n                                 II.\n\n            Travelers challenges the district court's determination\n\nthat Travelers waived its right to arbitrate any claims with class\n\nmembers who were covered by the class action certification. \"Under\n\nfederal law, such a [waiver] is an issue for the judge . . . and\n\npertinent fact findings by the judge aside (which would be reviewed\n\nfor clear error), our review is plenary.\"   Rankin v. Allstate Ins.\n\nCo., 336 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 2003)(internal citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n3\n   The district court also held that the motion to stay should be\ndenied because it did not provide a precise and clear form of\nproposed order specifying the relief sought. Because we agree with\nthe district court that Travelers waived its right to arbitration,\nwe do not address that portion of the district court's order.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          Federal policy strongly favors arbitration, see Moses H.\n\nCone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25\n\n(1983), but parties are not free to invoke arbitration rights at\n\nany time or under any circumstances. A party may waive arbitration\n\nexpressly or implicitly.     See Restoration Pres. Masonry, Inc. v.\n\nGrove Europe Ltd., 325 F.3d 54, 61 (1st Cir. 2003).    In the instant\n\ncase, the district court found that Travelers implicitly waived its\n\nright to arbitrate by participating in the litigation, unduly\n\ndelaying assertion of its arbitration right, and prejudicing the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n          \"If arbitration is invoked in response to a lawsuit, it\n\nmust be done early on in the case so resources are not needlessly\n\ndeployed.\"     Rankin, 336 F.3d at 13 (citing Menorah Ins. Co., Ltd.\n\nv. INX Reinsurance Corp., 72 F.3d 218, 221 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\nTravelers argues that it invoked its right to arbitration in a\n\ntimely manner, and that when it did so, plaintiffs had not suffered\n\nany prejudice; thus, Travelers argues, it did not implicitly waive\n\nany of its rights as to the arbitrable claims.     We disagree.\n\n             In this Circuit, no one factor dominates the analytical\n\nframework for determining whether a party has implicitly waived its\n\nright to arbitrate.\n\n             In   determining whether    a   party  to   an\n             arbitration agreement, usually a defendant,\n             has waived its arbitration right, federal\n             courts typically have looked to [1] whether\n             the party has actually participated in the\n             lawsuit or has taken other action inconsistent\n\n                                  -5-\n\f           with his right, . . . [2] whether the\n           litigation machinery has been substantially\n           invoked and the parties were well into\n           preparation of a lawsuit by the time an\n           intention to arbitrate was communicated by the\n           defendant to the plaintiff, . . . [3] whether\n           there has been a long delay in seeking the\n           stay or whether enforcement of arbitration was\n           brought up when trial was near at hand . . . .\n                  Other relevant factors are [4] whether\n           the defendants have invoked the jurisdiction\n           of the court by filing a counterclaim without\n           asking for a stay of the proceedings, . . .\n           [5] whether important intervening steps (e.g.\n           taking   advantage   of   judicial   discovery\n           procedures not available in arbitration . . .)\n           had taken place, . . . and [6] whether the\n           other   party   was   affected,   misled,   or\n           prejudiced by the delay.\n\nCreative Solutions Group, Inc. v. Pentzer Corp., 252 F.3d 28, 32-33\n\n(1st Cir. 2001)(quoting Jones Motor Co., Inc. v. Chauffeurs,\n\nTeamsters & Helpers Local Union No. 633, 671 F.2d 38, 44 (1st Cir.\n\n1982)).   We have emphasized that, to succeed on a claim of waiver,\n\nplaintiffs must show prejudice.     See Menorah Ins., 72 F.3d at 221\n\n(quoting Sevinor v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.,\n\n807 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1986)).   \"Prejudice is relevant to waiver\n\nwhen it is the product of a defendant's failure to timely invoke\n\nthe arbitration procedure.\"   Creative Solutions, 252 F.3d at 33.\n\nWhen determining whether a defendant prejudicially failed to invoke\n\narbitration in a timely manner, we consider the larger context of\n\nthe litigation. See Restoration Pres. Masonry, 325 F.3d at 61; see\n\nalso Navieros Inter-Americanos, S.A. v. M/V Vasilia Express, 120\n\nF.3d 304, 316 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            Travelers argues that it timely asserted its right to\n\narbitration in its motion to amend the complaint on April 17, 2002,\n\nfiled six months after the class certification on October 28, 2001.\n\nWe disagree. Travelers's April 17, 2002 motion to amend did indeed\n\narticulate its potential intentions to raise the arbitrability of\n\ncertain claims as an affirmative defense within the class-certified\n\naction.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c).              It was not until Travelers\n\nfiled its motion to stay arbitration, however, that Travelers\n\nactually asserted its right to arbitration and to proceedings\n\nextrinsic to the class action.             See 9 U.S.C. § 3.    Accordingly, in\n\nevaluating      the    extent    of    Travelers's      delay    in    initiating\n\narbitration, we look to the date of the motion to stay on May 5,\n\n2003 rather than the motion to amend on April 17, 2002.\n\n            Three full years had elapsed between the filing of the\n\ncomplaint on March 10, 2000 and the motion to stay.                     Travelers\n\nargues, however, the claims were not arbitrable until the district\n\ncourt certified the class in October 2001 because it was prohibited\n\nunder NASD rules from compelling arbitration on any pending claim.\n\nSee NASD Unif. Code of Arbitration § 10301(d).                      Even assuming\n\narguendo    that      the   filing    of    the   complaint   did     not   trigger\n\nTravelers's arbitration rights, the class certification sufficed to\n\nalert Travelers that some of the class members in this action were\n\ncovered    by   the    arbitration     clause.       Thus,    Travelers     was   on\n\nconstructive notice that claims were asserted which were subject to\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fthe arbitration provision for at least eighteen months prior to\n\nfiling the motion to stay.             There is no excuse for Travelers's\n\ndelay in notifying the class members of its intention to seek\n\narbitration      nor      for   failing     to   seek        arbitration    promptly.\n\n\"Litigation frequently puts parties to hard choices . . . .\"\n\nNavieros, 120 F.3d at 316.            Travelers knew its legal rights were\n\nimplicated in this class action.             \"[W]e have . . . recognized that\n\nthe very rationale for arbitration may be undercut if a party is\n\npermitted to pursue a claim through the courts and then later claim\n\na right to arbitration . . . . Accordingly, we have repeatedly held\n\nthat a party may, by engaging in litigation, implicitly waive its\n\ncontractual right to arbitrate.\" Id. (citing Menorah Ins., 72 F.3d\n\nat 223)(internal citation omitted).              In the context of this case,\n\nthe delay of more than three years after the filing of the\n\ncomplaint     and    of    18   months      after    class      certification       were\n\nsufficient to waive Travelers's right to arbitrate, as long as the\n\ndelay was prejudicial to plaintiffs.                See Menorah Ins., 72 F.3d at\n\n221-22 (waiver after one year delay).\n\n            Plaintiffs claim prejudice due to the delay for several\n\nreasons.      First, plaintiffs argue, and we agree, that if the\n\narbitrable claims are sent to arbitration they may be subject to\n\nnew   defenses      related     to   the   statute      of    limitations     and    the\n\nequitable doctrine of laches; and even if the defenses are not\n\nsuccessful, plaintiffs will have to respond to them.                       Second, the\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fclass notice was approved by the court in October 2001 and was sent\n\nimmediately thereafter.        See Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson & Co.,\n\nInc., 980 F.2d 912, 925-26 (3d Cir. 1992)(finding of waiver where\n\ndefendants in three class actions agreed to their consolidation).\n\nFinally,    plaintiffs      argue   that   they    have   structured   their\n\nlitigation as part of a class action regarding the same cause of\n\naction   and    not   as   individual    actions   focused   on   individual\n\nrecovery.      In the      consolidated cases, the plaintiff class had\n\nalready begun taking depositions and were subjects of motions to\n\ncompel and motions to seal.             In this case, at least fifteen\n\ndepositions relevant to the Connecticut class action have been\n\ntaken and at least twelve case management conferences were held.\n\nSee Restoration Pres. Masonry, 325 F.3d at 61 (stating that there\n\nwas prejudice when at least five depositions and thirteen pre-trial\n\nconferences had been held).         We believe that the plaintiffs have\n\nshown prejudice.\n\n            Travelers argues that virtually all of the discovery\n\nwhich has taken place is relevant to the claims by class members\n\nnot subject to arbitration.             As to class members subject to\n\narbitration, Travelers argues, discovery amounts only to five\n\nnarrowly tailored and court-approved interrogatories.               Further,\n\nthat discovery was available to plaintiffs in arbitration in any\n\nevent, so plaintiffs could not have been prejudiced.              We believe,\n\nhowever, the waiver issue must be viewed through the lens of\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fTravelers's behavior and the detriment to the plaintiffs as a\n\nresult of that behavior.          If those claims were the only claims\n\ninvolved in the litigation Travelers's argument against a finding\n\nof prejudice would carry more weight.          Travelers cannot now, after\n\nfailing to   invoke       its   arbitration   right,    rely   solely   on   the\n\nfortuitous number of interrogatories allegedly related to the class\n\nmembers subject to arbitration.          When a defendant has failed to\n\ntimely invoke its rights, and during that delay, the litigation has\n\nproceeded into discovery, it cannot, particularly in the context of\n\na class action, claim that the class members subject to arbitration\n\nwill not   suffer     prejudice.      Moreover,    we   must   evaluate      this\n\nargument in the context of the entire litigation, not a part of it.\n\nSee id.;   Navieros, 120 F.3d at 316.         Discovery that implicated the\n\nclass has begun: at least twelve sets of document requests have\n\nbeen served and answered; three sets of interrogatories have been\n\nserved and answered; and requests for admissions have been served\n\nand answered.    See Restoration Pres. Masonry, 325 F.3d at 61.\n\n           As stated above, Travelers took advantage of judicial\n\nresources such as depositions and case management conferences and\n\navailed    itself    of     the   uniquely     judicial    process      of   MDL\n\nconsolidation.      See id.; Menorah Ins., 72 F.3d at 222 (\"To require\n\nthat parties go to arbitration despite their having advanced so far\n\nin the court proceedings before seeking arbitration would often be\n\nunfair, for it would effectively allow a party sensing an adverse\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fcourt   decision    a    second    chance    in   another     forum.\").        Thus,\n\nTravelers's argument that plaintiffs are not prejudiced because\n\nonly five interrogatories have been answered which are relevant to\n\nthe class members with arbitrable claims is unavailing because it\n\nfails to account for two important factors: the costs already\n\nincurred in discovery to both class members with and without\n\narbitrable claims and the delay in invoking its arbitration rights;\n\nboth of which caused the class members with arbitrable claims\n\nprejudice.4\n\n           Other litigation activity points to Travelers's implicit\n\nwaiver of their right to arbitration.               See Jones Motor Co., 671\n\nF.2d at 44 (listing factors other than time and prejudice when\n\ndetermining whether a party has waived arbitration).                  Travelers\n\ninvoked the litigation machinery by filing a motion for summary\n\njudgment, which was denied without prejudice by the district court\n\nas premature.       See id.; see also Ritzel Communications, Inc. v.\n\nMid-American Cellular Tel., Co., 989 F.2d 966, 969 (8th Cir.\n\n1993)(filing    a       dispositive    motion       invokes     the   litigation\n\nmachinery).        Travelers      sought    to    certify   questions     to    the\n\n\n\n4\n    Travelers argues that no trial date has been set and that\nplaintiffs' trial strategy cannot therefore be implicated.     The\ntrial date cannot currently be set for this matter by the district\njudge. See 28 U.S.C. § 1407(a)(stating that once the MDL procedure\nis complete, the matters will be remanded to the transferor courts\nand set for trial).    Given that this is an MDL litigation, we\nbelieve that this argument cannot be successful when viewed in the\ncontext of the litigation proceedings that have already occurred.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fConnecticut    Supreme     Court   and    vigorously     opposed     class\n\ncertification.    Travelers also filed a compulsory counterclaim\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a) in this lawsuit.

We have emphasized that, to succeed on a claim of waiver, plaintiffs must show prejudice. <i>See Menorah Ins.,</i> 72 F.3d at 221 (quoting <i>Sevinor v.

When determining whether a defendant prejudicially failed to invoke arbitration in a timely manner, we consider the larger context of the litigation. <i>See Restoration Pres. Masonry,</i> 325 F.3d at 61; <i>see also Navieros Inter-Americanos, S.A. v. M/V Vasilia Express,</i> 120 F.3d 304, 316 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers argues that it timely asserted its right to arbitration in its motion to amend the complaint on April 17, 2002, filed six months after the class certification on October 28, 2001. We disagree. Travelers's April 17, 2002 motion to amend did indeed articulate its potential intentions to raise the arbitrability of certain claims as an affirmative defense within the class-certified action. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c). It was not until Travelers filed its motion to stay, however, that Travelers actually asserted its right to arbitration and to proceedings extrinsic to the class action. <i>See</i> 9 U.S.C. &#167; 3. Accordingly, in evaluating the extent of Travelers's delay in initiating arbitration, we look to the date of the motion to stay on May 5, 2003 rather than the motion to amend on April 17, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three full years had elapsed between the filing of the complaint on March 10, 2000 and the motion to stay. Travelers argues, however, the claims were not arbitrable until the district court certified the class in October 2001 because it was prohibited under NASD rules from compelling arbitration on any pending claim. <i>See</i> NASD Unif.Code of Arbitration &#167; 10301(d). Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the filing of the complaint did not trigger Travelers's arbitration rights, the class certification sufficed to alert Travelers that some of the class members in this action were covered by the arbitration clause. Thus, Travelers was on constructive notice that claims were asserted which were subject to the arbitration provision for at least eighteen months prior to filing the motion to stay. There is no excuse for Travelers's delay in notifying the class members of its intention to seek arbitration nor for failing to seek arbitration promptly. \"Litigation frequently puts parties to hard choices....\" <i>Navieros,</i> 120 F.3d at 316. Travelers knew its legal rights were implicated in this class action. \"[W]e have ... recognized that the very rationale for arbitration may be undercut if a party is permitted to pursue a claim through the courts and then later claim a right to arbitration.... Accordingly, we have repeatedly held that a party may, by engaging in litigation, implicitly waive its contractual right to arbitrate.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Menorah Ins.,</i> 72 F.3d at 223)(internal citation omitted). In the context of this case, the delay of more than three years after the filing of the complaint and of 18 months after class certification were sufficient to waive Travelers's right to arbitrate, as long as the delay was prejudicial to plaintiffs. <i>See Menorah Ins.,</i> 72 F.3d at 221-22 (waiver after one year delay).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim prejudice due to the delay for several reasons. First, plaintiffs argue, and we agree, that if the arbitrable claims are sent to arbitration they may be subject to new defenses related to the statute of limitations and the equitable doctrine of laches; and even if the defenses are not successful, plaintiffs will have to respond to them. Second, the class notice was approved by the court in October 2001 and was sent immediately thereafter. <i>See Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., Inc.,</i> 980 F.2d 912, 925-26 (3d Cir.1992)(finding of waiver where defendants in three class actions agreed to their consolidation). Finally, plaintiffs argue that they have structured their litigation as part of a class action regarding the same cause of action and not as individual actions focused on individual recovery. In the consolidated cases, the plaintiff class had already begun taking depositions and were subjects of motions to compel and motions to seal. In this case, at least fifteen depositions relevant to the Connecticut class action have been taken and at least twelve case management conferences were held. <i>See Restoration Pres. Masonry,</i> 325 F.3d at 61 (stating that there was prejudice when at least five depositions and thirteen pre-trial conferences had been held). We believe that the plaintiffs have shown prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers argues that virtually all of the discovery which has taken place is relevant to the claims by class members not subject to arbitration. As to class members subject to arbitration, Travelers argues, discovery amounts only to five narrowly tailored and court-approved interrogatories. Further, that discovery was available to plaintiffs in arbitration in any event, so plaintiffs could not have been prejudiced. We believe, however, the waiver issue must be viewed through the lens of Travelers's behavior and the detriment to the plaintiffs as a result of that behavior. If those claims were the only claims involved in the litigation Travelers's argument against a finding of prejudice would carry more weight. Travelers cannot now, after failing to invoke its arbitration right, rely solely on the fortuitous number of interrogatories allegedly related to the class members subject to arbitration. When a defendant has failed to timely invoke its rights, and during that delay, the litigation has proceeded into discovery, it cannot, particularly in the context of a class action, claim that the class members subject to arbitration will not suffer prejudice. Moreover, we must evaluate this argument in the context of the entire litigation, not a part of it. <i>See id.; Navieros,</i> 120 F.3d at 316. Discovery that implicated the class has begun: at least twelve sets of document requests have been served and answered; three sets of interrogatories have been served and answered; and requests for admissions have been served and answered. <i>See Restoration Pres. Masonry,</i> 325 F.3d at 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, Travelers took advantage of judicial resources such as depositions and case management conferences and availed itself of the uniquely judicial process of MDL consolidation. <i>See id.; Menorah Ins.,</i> 72 F.3d at 222 (\"To require that parties go to arbitration despite their having advanced so far in the court proceedings before seeking arbitration would often be unfair, for it would effectively allow a party sensing an adverse court decision a second chance in another forum.\"). Thus, Travelers's argument that plaintiffs are not prejudiced because only five interrogatories have been answered which are relevant to the class members with arbitrable claims is unavailing because it fails to account for two important factors: the costs already incurred in discovery to both class members with and without arbitrable claims and the delay in invoking its arbitration rights; both of which caused the class members with arbitrable claims prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other litigation activity points to Travelers's implicit waiver of their right to arbitration. <i>See Jones Motor Co.,</i> 671 F.2d at 44 (listing factors other than time and prejudice when determining whether a party has waived arbitration). Travelers invoked the litigation machinery by filing a motion for summary judgment, which was denied without prejudice by the district court as premature. <i>See id.; see also Ritzel Communications, Inc. v. Mid-American Cellular Tel., Co.,</i> 989 F.2d 966, 969 (8th Cir.1993)(filing a dispositive motion invokes the litigation machinery). Travelers sought to certify questions to the Connecticut Supreme Court and vigorously opposed class certification. Travelers also filed a compulsory counterclaim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a) in this lawsuit. <i>See Jones Motor Co.,</i> 671 F.2d at 44 (one factor in determining waiver is \"whether the defendants have invoked the jurisdiction of the court by filing a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings\"). Travelers cannot overcome the prejudice suffered by plaintiffs due to the delay in asserting its right to arbitration. Given the complexity of the litigation, knowing full well the wide-ranging implications for all parties involved (across several jurisdictions), Travelers should have acted in a prompt manner to assert its right to arbitrate claims in issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's denial of the motion to stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

We disagree. Travelers's April 17, 2002 motion to amend did indeed articulate its potential intentions to raise the arbitrability of certain claims as an affirmative defense within the class-certified action. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c). It was not until Travelers filed its motion to stay, however, that Travelers actually asserted its right to arbitration and to proceedings extrinsic to the class action. <i>See</i> 9 U.S.C. &#167; 3. Accordingly, in evaluating the extent of Travelers's delay in initiating arbitration, we look to the date of the motion to stay on May 5, 2003 rather than the motion to amend on April 17, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three full years had elapsed between the filing of the complaint on March 10, 2000 and the motion to stay. Travelers argues, however, the claims were not arbitrable until the district court certified the class in October 2001 because it was prohibited under NASD rules from compelling arbitration on any pending claim. <i>See</i> NASD Unif.Code of Arbitration &#167; 10301(d). Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the filing of the complaint did not trigger Travelers's arbitration rights, the class certification sufficed to alert Travelers that some of the class members in this action were covered by the arbitration clause. Thus, Travelers was on constructive notice that claims were asserted which were subject to the arbitration provision for at least eighteen months prior to filing the motion to stay. There is no excuse for Travelers's delay in notifying the class members of its intention to seek arbitration nor for failing to seek arbitration promptly. \"Litigation frequently puts parties to hard choices....\" <i>Navieros,</i> 120 F.3d at 316. Travelers knew its legal rights were implicated in this class action. \"[W]e have ... recognized that the very rationale for arbitration may be undercut if a party is permitted to pursue a claim through the courts and then later claim a right to arbitration.... Accordingly, we have repeatedly held that a party may, by engaging in litigation, implicitly waive its contractual right to arbitrate.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Menorah Ins.,</i> 72 F.3d at 223)(internal citation omitted). In the context of this case, the delay of more than three years after the filing of the complaint and of 18 months after class certification were sufficient to waive Travelers's right to arbitrate, as long as the delay was prejudicial to plaintiffs. <i>See Menorah Ins.,</i> 72 F.3d at 221-22 (waiver after one year delay).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim prejudice due to the delay for several reasons. First, plaintiffs argue, and we agree, that if the arbitrable claims are sent to arbitration they may be subject to new defenses related to the statute of limitations and the equitable doctrine of laches; and even if the defenses are not successful, plaintiffs will have to respond to them. Second, the class notice was approved by the court in October 2001 and was sent immediately thereafter. <i>See Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596121\"><a href=\"/opinion/596121/dan-h-hoxworth-louise-a-hoxworth-bradley-gavron-barry-brownstein-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span>, 925-26 (3d Cir.1992)(finding of waiver where defendants in three class actions agreed to their consolidation). Finally, plaintiffs argue that they have structured their litigation as part of a class action regarding the same cause of action and not as individual actions focused on individual recovery. In the consolidated cases, the plaintiff class had already begun taking depositions and were subjects of motions to compel and motions to seal. In this case, at least fifteen depositions relevant to the Connecticut class action have been taken and at least twelve case management conferences were held. <i>See Restoration Pres. Masonry,</i> 325 F.3d at 61 (stating that there was prejudice when at least five depositions and thirteen pre-trial conferences had been held). We believe that the plaintiffs have shown prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers argues that virtually all of the discovery which has taken place is relevant to the claims by class members not subject to arbitration. As to class members subject to arbitration, Travelers argues, discovery amounts only to five narrowly tailored and court-approved interrogatories. Further, that discovery was available to plaintiffs in arbitration in any event, so plaintiffs could not have been prejudiced. We believe, however, the waiver issue must be viewed through the lens of Travelers's behavior and the detriment to the plaintiffs as a result of that behavior. If those claims were the only claims involved in the litigation Travelers's argument against a finding of prejudice would carry more weight. Travelers cannot now, after failing to invoke its arbitration right, rely solely on the fortuitous number of interrogatories allegedly related to the class members subject to arbitration. When a defendant has failed to timely invoke its rights, and during that delay, the litigation has proceeded into discovery, it cannot, particularly in the context of a class action, claim that the class members subject to arbitration will not suffer prejudice. Moreover, we must evaluate this argument in the context of the entire litigation, not a part of it. <i>See id.; Navieros,</i> 120 F.3d at 316. Discovery that implicated the class has begun: at least twelve sets of document requests have been served and answered; three sets of interrogatories have been served and answered; and requests for admissions have been served and answered. <i>See Restoration Pres. Masonry,</i> 325 F.3d at 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, Travelers took advantage of judicial resources such as depositions and case management conferences and availed itself of the uniquely judicial process of MDL consolidation. <i>See id.; Menorah Ins.,</i> 72 F.3d at 222 (\"To require that parties go to arbitration despite their having advanced so far in the court proceedings before seeking arbitration would often be unfair, for it would effectively allow a party sensing an adverse court decision a second chance in another forum.\"). Thus, Travelers's argument that plaintiffs are not prejudiced because only five interrogatories have been answered which are relevant to the class members with arbitrable claims is unavailing because it fails to account for two important factors: the costs already incurred in discovery to both class members with and without arbitrable claims and the delay in invoking its arbitration rights; both of which caused the class members with arbitrable claims prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other litigation activity points to Travelers's implicit waiver of their right to arbitration. <i>See Jones Motor Co.,</i> 671 F.2d at 44 (listing factors other than time and prejudice when determining whether a party has waived arbitration). Travelers invoked the litigation machinery by filing a motion for summary judgment, which was denied without prejudice by the district court as premature. <i>See id.; see also Ritzel Communications, Inc. v. Mid-American Cellular Tel., Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603562\"><a href=\"/opinion/603562/ritzel-communications-inc-v-mid-american-cellular-telephone-company-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span>, 969 (8th Cir.1993)(filing a dispositive motion invokes the litigation machinery). Travelers sought to certify questions to the Connecticut Supreme Court and vigorously opposed class certification. Travelers also filed a compulsory counterclaim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a) in this lawsuit. <i>See Jones Motor Co.,</i> 671 F.2d at 44 (one factor in determining waiver is \"whether the defendants have invoked the jurisdiction of the court by filing a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings\"). Travelers cannot overcome the prejudice suffered by plaintiffs due to the delay in asserting its right to arbitration. Given the complexity of the litigation, knowing full well the wide-ranging implications for all parties involved (across several jurisdictions), Travelers should have acted in a prompt manner to assert its right to arbitrate claims in issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's denial of the motion to stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.
