Diane Farley spent a portion of\n\nthe evening of April 23, 1993, at the home of Sarah Ann Marsceill\n\nin Dedham, Massachusetts.   The two went out together, returning to\n\nMarsceill's home in the early morning hours of April 24.     Farley\n\nremained there until around 9:30 a.m.    Driven away by a friend,\n\nFarley was said to have had a dark, wet stain on her trousers, for\n\nwhich she offered inconsistent explanations, and to have had a roll\n\nof twenty dollar bills even though she had earlier said she had no\n\nmoney.   Later that afternoon, Marsceill was found dead in her\n\nbedroom, having been stabbed to death in a bloody fashion.\n\n          Farley was tried and convicted of first degree murder.\n\nThere was some forensic evidence against Farley,1 enhanced by her\n\nobserved presence at the scene, arguable evidence of a quarrel\n\nbetween the two women, and various inconsistent statements and\n\npositions offered by Farley.    An initial conviction was reversed\n\nfor ineffective assistance of counsel, Commonwealth v. Farley\n\n(Farley I), 732 N.E.2d 893 (Mass. 2000), but her conviction after\n\na retrial was affirmed. Commonwealth v. Farley (Farley II), 824\n\nN.E.2d 797 (Mass. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Over and above the supposed stain, blood consistent with\nFarley's was found on Marsceill's body, under one of Marsceill's\nfingernails, and on the bedspread. Both Farley's and Marsceill's\nblood were found on a bathrobe in the living room. There was also\nforensic evidence linking May to the scene but he admitted having\nbeen there on an earlier evening, and Farley never claimed that she\nhad seen May at Marsceill's house the night of the murder.\n\n                                -2-\n\f           Farley then sought habeas relief in the district court.\n\nAlthough the district court denied relief, Farley v. Bissonnette,\n\nNo. 06-10672-GAO, 2007 WL 4377608 (D. Mass. Dec. 11, 2007), it\n\ngranted a certificate of appealability as to two questions.                The\n\nfirst (we set forth the second one later in this opinion) was\n\nwhether   \"the   trial   judge's   instruction    to   the   jury   that   the\n\nprosecution 'does not have the burden of proving that no one else\n\nmay have committed the murder' [was] an error that was contrary to\n\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent as stated in In re\n\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970).\"          Farley v. Bissonnette, No. 06-\n\n10672, 2008 WL 227870 (D. Mass. Jan. 28, 2008).\n\n           The context for the instruction was Farley's contention\n\nat trial that the murder had been committed not by Farley but by\n\none of two other named individuals:          Michael May, who admitted to\n\na brief association with Marsceill, or Ronald James, said to be a\n\ndrug dealer.     Farley did not testify at trial, but the jury heard\n\ngovernment   evidence    that   she    had   initially   told   police     and\n\ntestified before the grand jury that she left while James and\n\nMarsceill were arguing and then later changed her explanation to a\n\nclaim that James had stabbed both women.2         The Commonwealth called\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The Commonwealth read portions of Farley's testimony from the\nfirst trial and before the grand jury into the record and played an\naudiotape of Farley's interview at the police station; in addition,\nthe investigating officer testified about Farley's various\nstatements. Farley II, 824 N.E.2d at 802 n.8.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fboth James and May as witnesses; both said that they had not even\n\nbeen at the Marsceill house on the night of the murder.\n\n          The trial judge, at the Commonwealth's request and over\n\nFarley's objection, told the jury that Farley was presumed innocent\n\nand the Commonwealth had the burden of proving her guilty of every\n\nelement of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, but that \"[t]he\n\nCommonwealth does not have the burden of proving that no one else\n\nmay have committed the murder.\"   Farley II, 824 N.E.2d at 802 n.10.\n\nFarley says that this was error because her defense--that May or\n\nJames had committed the murder--meant that this premise had to be\n\ndisproved in order to find her guilty and so was part of the\n\nprosecution's burden.\n\n          Because this claim (and the one that follows) were\n\nresolved on the merits by the state court, our review is governed\n\nby the standard set forth in the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death\n\nPenalty Act (AEDPA), namely, we ask whether the state decision \"was\n\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\n\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\n\nUnited States.\"   28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) (2006).     In this instance,\n\nthis required deference does not matter: the instruction at issue\n\ndoes not contravene Winship.\n\n          The jury was told repeatedly that the Commonwealth had to\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that Farley had committed the\n\nmurder, whose elements under Massachusetts law were defined in the\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\finstructions.3           The proposition that Farley says the government had\n\nto prove--that neither May nor James had committed the murder--is\n\nnot an element of the crime (such as \"premeditation\"); it is a\n\nfactual assertion that might, or might not, be relevant in the\n\njury's evaluation of the evidence against Farley.\n\n               Farley argues that if May or James murdered Marsceill,\n\nthen this would automatically exculpate Farley; but this is not\n\nnecessarily so since she could also have aided or participated.\n\nAnd   even     in    a    case    where   in   context   it   had   to   be    so,   the\n\nprosecution would be perfectly free to concentrate on the evidence\n\nthat implicated Farley without in any way countering evidence\n\nrelied    on    by       Farley   to   show    that   someone   else     had   motive,\n\nopportunity, access and so forth.\n\n               Thus, where the defense attempts to cast the blame on\n\nsomeone other than the defendant, it is not unusual for the court\n\nto remind the jury that the government's burden is to show that the\n\ndefendant is guilty--not that the other person whom the defendant\n\nseeks to blame is innocent.               In Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307\n\n(1979), the Court itself observed that Winship does not place \"the\n\nprosecution . . . under an affirmative duty to rule out every\n\nhypothesis except that of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. at\n\n\n\n      3\n       The challenged instruction appeared between two sentences\nstating that the prosecution had the burden of proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt as to each element of the crime, a burden that was\nrepeated at least ten additional times in the instruction.\n\n                                              -5-\n\f326.   The contested instruction in this case did no more than\n\nrepeat Jackson's caveat.\n\n            Every instruction must be judged on its own terms,\n\nincluding the language used and the context of facts and arguments\n\noffered in the case.   See Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1, 6 (1994)\n\n(the relevant question is \"whether there is a reasonable likelihood\n\nthat the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based\n\non proof insufficient to meet the Winship standard\"). Perhaps some\n\nrare case might arise in which a warning by the judge as to what\n\nthe government did not have to prove might confuse the situation or\n\nlead the jury to believe that a legitimate argument by the defense\n\nwas logically irrelevant.   Taking the instructions as a whole, see\n\nEstelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 72 (1991), nothing of the sort\n\noccurred in this case.\n\n            Farley's second claim is that the trial court violated\n\nher Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause right under Delaware v.\n\nVan Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673 (1986), by limiting her cross-examination\n\nof James.      This is reflected in the district court's second\n\ncertified issue, namely, whether \"the state court's decision that\n\nthe trial judge's limitation of the petitioner's cross-examination\n\nof Ronald James, though error, was harmless beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt [was] an unreasonable application of clearly established\n\nSupreme Court precedent, namely, Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S.\n\n673 (1986).\"    Farley, 2008 WL 227870, at *1.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          James had testified that he did not know May.   On cross-\n\nexamination, Farley wanted to show this testimony was false by\n\nquestioning James about his relationship to Sarah Zene, a former\n\ndrug runner who was going to testify that she had delivered drugs\n\nfor James to May and that the two knew one another.       The trial\n\njudge allowed James to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege to\n\nblock this line of questioning.\n\n          The Supreme Judicial Court held that the trial judge\n\nshould have allowed the questioning because in its view James had\n\nwaived the privilege by testimony he had given in the first trial;\n\nbut, the SJC found the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nunder Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967), because Zene\n\nherself testified in the second trial that she had delivered drugs\n\nfor James to May and that the two knew one another.    The SJC said\n\nthat the cross-examination would at best have been cumulative.\n\n          Again, the SJC gets deference under AEDPA so, strictly\n\nspeaking, the question is not our own judgment about Chapman and\n\nVan Arsdall but the reasonableness of the SJC's application, see\n\nMitchell v. Esparza, 540 U.S. 12, 17-18 (2003); Hurtado v. Tucker,\n\n245 F.3d 7, 20 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 925 (2001),\n\nsubstituting a more deferential form of harmless error review on\n\nhabeas.   See generally Fry v. Pliler, 127 S. Ct. 2321, 2327-28\n\n(2007); Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619 (1993).    In all events,\n\nwe would reach the same decision ourselves.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f          Farley does not claim that the cross-examination was\n\ndesigned to do anything other than attack James' credibility.   His\n\ncredibility was relevant since Farley--seeking to suggest that\n\nJames might have committed the crime--had to challenge his denial\n\nof involvement.    But Farley's counsel was able to raise serious\n\nquestions about James' credibility on cross-examination through\n\nevidence of his prior criminal conviction and prior inconsistent\n\nstatements.    When Zene then testified that James did know May, she\n\nadded a further contradiction and supplied the information that\n\nFarley had wanted to elicit on cross-examination.\n\n          Doubtless it is often best to have the witness being\n\nimpeached made on cross-examination himself to admit he was lying;\n\nbut (as we have explained) James' general credibility was amply put\n\nin question.    It is pure speculation to think that he would have\n\nadmitted to knowing May after flatly denying it; and, if he had, it\n\nwould have been an admission to a fact to which Zene herself\n\ntestified.     There is no reason whatever to think that cross-\n\nexamination would have changed the result.\n\n          In Van Arsdall, the Court mentioned a number of factors\n\nbearing on an assessment of harmlessness, including the importance\n\nof the testimony foreclosed, whether it was cumulative, the extent\n\nof cross-examination otherwise permitted, \"and, of course, the\n\noverall strength of the prosecution's case.\"      475 U.S. at 684.\n\nHere, the excluded cross-examination was on a collateral issue--\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthat     is,    for   impeachment   and    not   the   merits--and   largely\n\ncumulative; it is worth adding that the prosecution's case was\n\nstrong.\n\n               Although no eye witness saw Farley commit the murder, she\n\nalone had been observed at the scene, there was arguable evidence\n\nof a quarrel between the women, both the dark patch and the mingled\n\nblood samples linked Farley to the crime, and her inconsistent\n\nstatements enhanced suspicion.             By contrast, nothing directly\n\nlinked James to the crime beyond Farley's prior claims that James\n\nhad stabbed both women--a claim presented to the jury only through\n\nher prior testimony and statements to the police.              See note 2,\n\nabove.    The chance of shifting blame to James was slight indeed.\n\n               The denial of the writ is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

Ravitz, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, and SCHWARZER,<sup>[*]</sup> District Judge.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Diane Farley spent a portion of the evening of April 23, 1993, at the home of Sarah Ann Marsceill in Dedham, Massachusetts. The two went out together, returning to Marsceill's home in the early morning hours of April 24. Farley remained there until around 9:30 a.m. Driven away by a friend, Farley was said to have had a dark, wet stain on her trousers, for which she offered inconsistent explanations, and to have had a roll of twenty dollar bills even though she had earlier said she had no money. Later that afternoon, Marsceill was found dead in her bedroom, having been stabbed to death in a bloody fashion.</p>\n<p>Farley was tried and convicted of first degree murder. There was some forensic evidence against Farley,<sup>[1]</sup> enhanced by her observed presence at the scene, arguable evidence of a quarrel between the two women, and various inconsistent statements and positions offered by Farley. An initial conviction was reversed for ineffective assistance of counsel, <i>Commonwealth v. Farley (Farley I),</i> 432 Mass.153, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></span> (Mass.2000), but her conviction after a retrial was affirmed. <i>Commonwealth v.

Although the district court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*346</span> denied relief, <i>Farley v. Bissonnette,</i> No. 06-10672, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4377608</span></span> (D.Mass. Dec.11, 2007), it granted a certificate of appealability as to two questions. The first (we set forth the second one later in this opinion) was whether \"the trial judge's instruction to the jury that the prosecution 'does not have the burden of proving that no one else may have committed the murder' [was] an error that was contrary to clearly established Supreme Court precedent as stated in <i>In re Winship,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span> (1970).\" <i>Farley v. Bissonnette,</i> No. 06-10672, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">227870</span></span> (D.Mass. Jan.28, 2008).</p>\n<p>The context for the instruction was Farley's contention at trial that the murder had been committed not by Farley but by one of two other named individuals: Michael May, who admitted to a brief association with Marsceill, or Ronald James, said to be a drug dealer. Farley did not testify at trial, but the jury heard government evidence that she had initially told police and testified before the grand jury that she left while James and Marsceill were arguing and then later changed her explanation to a claim that James had stabbed both women.<sup>[2]</sup> The Commonwealth called both James and May as witnesses; both said that they had not even been at the Marsceill house on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p>The trial judge, at the Commonwealth's request and over Farley's objection, told the jury that Farley was presumed innocent and the Commonwealth had the burden of proving her guilty of every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, but that \"[t]he Commonwealth does not have the burden of proving that no one else may have committed the murder.\" <i>Farley II,</i> 824 N.E.2d at 802 n. 10. Farley says that this was error because her defensethat May or James had committed the murdermeant that this premise had to be disproved in order to find her guilty and so was part of the prosecution's burden.</p>\n<p>Because this claim (and the one that follows) were resolved on the merits by the state court, our review is governed by the standard set forth in the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), namely, we ask whether the state decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) (2006). In this instance, this required deference does not matter: the instruction at issue does not contravene <i>Winship.</i></p>\n<p>The jury was told repeatedly that the Commonwealth had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Farley had committed the murder, whose elements under Massachusetts law were defined in the instructions.<sup>[3]</sup> The proposition that Farley says the government had to provethat neither May nor James had committed the murderis not an <i>element</i> of the crime (such as \"premeditation\"); it is a factual assertion that might, or might not, be relevant in the jury's evaluation of the evidence against Farley.</p>\n<p>Farley argues that if May or James murdered Marsceill, then this would automatically <span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> exculpate Farley; but this is not necessarily so since she could also have aided or participated. And even in a case where in context it had to be so, the prosecution would be perfectly free to concentrate on the evidence that implicated Farley without in any way countering evidence relied on by Farley to show that someone else had motive, opportunity, access and so forth.</p>\n<p>Thus, where the defense attempts to cast the blame on someone other than the defendant, it is not unusual for the court to remind the jury that the government's burden is to show that the defendant is guiltynot that the other person whom the defendant seeks to blame is innocent. In <i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span> (1979), the Court itself observed that <i>Winship</i> does not place \"the prosecution ... under an affirmative duty to rule out every hypothesis except that of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> at 326, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2781</span></a></span>. The contested instruction in this case did no more than repeat <i>Jackson</i>'s caveat.</p>\n<p>Every instruction must be judged on its own terms, including the language used and the context of facts and arguments offered in the case. <i>See </i><i>Victor v. Nebraska,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117831\"><a href=\"/opinion/117831/victor-v-nebraska/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117831\"><a href=\"/opinion/117831/victor-v-nebraska/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span> (1994) (the relevant question is \"whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the <i>Winship</i> standard\"). Perhaps some rare case might arise in which a warning by the judge as to what the government did not have to prove might confuse the situation or lead the jury to believe that a legitimate argument by the defense was logically irrelevant. Taking the instructions as a whole, <i>see </i><i>Estelle v. McGuire,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112660\"><a href=\"/opinion/112660/estelle-v-mcguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112660\"><a href=\"/opinion/112660/estelle-v-mcguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span> (1991), nothing of the sort occurred in this case.</p>\n<p>Farley's second claim is that the trial court violated her Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause right under <i>Delaware v. Van Arsdall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1986), by limiting her cross-examination of James. This is reflected in the district court's second certified issue, namely, whether \"the state court's decision that the trial judge's limitation of the petitioner's cross-examination of Ronald James, though error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt [was] an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent, namely, <i>Delaware v. Van Arsdall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On cross-examination, Farley wanted to show this testimony was false by questioning James about his relationship to Sarah Zene, a former drug runner who was going to testify that she had delivered drugs for James to May and that the two knew one another. The trial judge allowed James to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege to block this line of questioning.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Judicial Court held that the trial judge should have allowed the questioning because in its view James had waived the privilege by testimony he had given in the first trial; but, the SJC found the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <i>Chapman v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The SJC said that the cross-examination would at best have been cumulative.</p>\n<p>Again, the SJC gets deference under AEDPA so, strictly speaking, the question is not our own judgment about <i>Chapman</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> and <i>Van Arsdall</i> but the reasonableness of the SJC's application, <i>see </i><i>Mitchell v.

In all events, we would reach the same decision ourselves.</p>\n<p>Farley does not claim that the cross-examination was designed to do anything other than attack James' credibility. His credibility was relevant since Farley seeking to suggest that James might have committed the crimehad to challenge his denial of involvement. But Farley's counsel was able to raise serious questions about James' credibility on cross-examination through evidence of his prior criminal conviction and prior inconsistent statements.
