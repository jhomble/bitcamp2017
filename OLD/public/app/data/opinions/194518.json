This is  an appeal  of a  National Labor\n                     \n\nRelations Board (the \"Board\") decision that appellants, Acme Tile\n\nand Terrazzo  Co., Roman Tile  and Terrazzo, Jolicoeur  &amp; Resmini\n\nCo., and Admiral  Tile Co., Inc.  (the \"employers\"), violated    \n\n8(a)(1),  (2), and (3) of  the National Labor  Relations Act (the\n\n\"Act\"), 29 U.S.C.   151, et seq. (1973).  Specifically, the Board\n                               \n\nfound   that   the  employers   conditioned   employees'  further\n\nemployment on  their membership  in an  employer-recognized Union\n\nbefore the  statutorily required,  seven day grace  period ended.\n\nBecause we find that the Board based its decision on an erroneous\n\nassumption,  we  vacate  the  order and  remand  for  proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          The employers entered a contract with the International\n\nUnion of  Bricklayers and  Allied Craftsmen,  Local  No. 1  Rhode\n\nIsland (the \"Union\").   The contract  required employees to  join\n\nthe Union within eight days of the agreement's execution.  \n\n          The administrative law judge  (the \"ALJ\") found that on\n\nMarch 31, 1989, the  employers told the employees that  they must\n\nsecure a referral from the Union by April 3, 1989, two days after\n\nthe agreement's  execution, if  they wanted to  continue working,\n\nand that the  employees would have  to join the  Union.  The  ALJ\n\nconcluded  that the employer's  actions did not  violate the Act.\n\nOn appeal, the  Board found  that the employers  did violate  the\n\nAct.  In arriving  at this conclusion, it erroneously  noted that\n\nthe  ALJ credited testimony that on March 31, 1989, the employers\n\n                               -3-\n\nrequired their employees to  join the Union  by April 3, 1989  in\n                                 \n\norder to  keep their jobs.   The  Board and the  ALJ agreed  that\n\nregardless of the employer's actual words, the employees  did not\n\njoin the Union and did not work on April 3.  \n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n          We  will enforce  an order  by the  Board if  the Board\n\ncorrectly  applied  the law  and if  substantial evidence  on the\n\nrecord  supports  the  Board's   factual  findings.

NLRB,  882 F.2d  19,  20-22 (1st  Cir. 1989)\n                         \n\n(quoting Penntech Papers, Inc.  v. NLRB, 706 F.2d 18,  22-23 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1983)).  \n\n          The Act requires a seven day grace period for employees\n\nto  join  an   employer-recognized  union  in   the  construction\n\nindustry.   29 U.S.C.    158(f) (1973).   Thus,  if the employers\n\nrequired the  employees to join  the Union by  April 3, only  two\n\ndays into that grace period, they violated the Act.\n\n          It is unclear, however, whether substantial evidence on\n\nthe  record would support the Board's factual findings.  At least\n\nfive employees testified that the employers required them to join\n\nthe Union by April 3.  Additionally, the employers testified that\n\nthey required the employees to get  a Union referral by April  3,\n\nand the employers presented no evidence that the Union would have\n\nreferred the employees if they refused to join the Union at  that\n\ntime.    Rather  than basing  its  factual  determination  on the\n\nevidence presented,  however, the  Board's opinion relied  on the\n\nincorrect  assumption  that  the  ALJ found  that  the  employers\n\n                               -4-\n\nrequired the  employees to join the  Union by April 3.

In reality,\n\nthe ALJ found that the employers required the  employees to get a\n\nUnion referral by April 3, and to join  the Union by April 9, the\n\ndate prescribed  in  the contract.    Indeed, the  ALJ's  opinion\n\nspecifically  stated  that   the  employers  did   not  condition\n                                                      \n\nemployment on immediate membership  in the Union.

Accordingly, we vacate the Board's order and remand for a\n\ndetermination of whether  the employers explicitly or  implicitly\n\nconditioned  continued employment on  immediate membership in the\n\nUnion.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n                              \n\n                               -5-\n",

In reality,\n\nthe ALJ found that the employers required the  employees to get a\n\nUnion referral by April 3, and to join  the Union by April 9, the\n\ndate prescribed  in  the contract.    Indeed, the  ALJ's  opinion\n\nspecifically  stated  that   the  employers  did   not  condition\n                                                      \n\nemployment on immediate membership  in the Union.

Accordingly, we vacate the Board's order and remand for a\n\ndetermination of whether  the employers explicitly or  implicitly\n\nconditioned  continued employment on  immediate membership in the\n\nUnion.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n                              \n\n                               -5-\n</pre>",
