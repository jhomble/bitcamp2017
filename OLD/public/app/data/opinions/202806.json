Sullivan, United States Attorney,\nand Fred M. Wyshak, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney, were\non brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 20,2007\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.     Bruce Scott Ziskind was indicted\n\nin 2002 of one count of conspiracy to steal goods traveling in\n\ninterstate commerce and two counts of receiving stolen interstate\n\nshipments of goods.      18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiracy); 18 U.S.C. § 659\n\n(receipt of stolen goods).      A jury convicted Ziskind on all counts\n\nof   the   indictment,    and   he   was   sentenced   to   63   months   of\n\nimprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently.             Ziskind\n\nappeals his conviction and sentence.1\n\n            In early 1995, Ziskind and his associate, John \"Mick\"\n\nMurray, devised a scheme to steal computer equipment from local\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) shipments.           They recruited, Daniel\n\nGilday, a UPS worker, and told him to steal computer equipment and\n\npass it along to Ziskind.        Ziskind owned an electronics company\n\nthrough which he sold the stolen merchandise and shared a portion\n\nof the profits with Murray and Gilday.            On several occasions,\n\nZiskind searched some UPS trucks for merchandise himself and\n\nassisted Gilday in recruiting other UPS drivers for the scheme.\n\n            Eventually, Gilday became disenchanted with his cut of\n\nthe profits, so he found another buyer, Robert Powell, who paid\n\nbetter.    On occasion, Gilday still provided goods to Ziskind and\n\nMurray.    Soon, however, Ziskind noticed that Gilday's supply had\n\ndiminished and complained to Gilday about it.\n\n\n\n      1\n      We recently rejected another appeal from Ziskind in a\ncriminal prosecution involving a different theft conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. Ziskind, 471 U.S. 266 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           In   January    1997,    Gilday    stole       a   shipment   of\n\nsemiconductors that the United States Navy was returning to Alamo\n\nComputer in Massachusetts and delivered them to Murray.            Ziskind\n\ninitially claimed that the semiconductors were worthless but later\n\nlearned that they were very valuable.           This led to a dispute\n\nbetween Ziskind and Gilday, which Ziskind resolved by paying Gilday\n\n$5,000.   In May 1997, Gilday stole a shipment of video cards from\n\na company called Osicom Technology and, after unsuccessfully trying\n\nto sell them to Powell, sold them to Ziskind.             Soon after this\n\ntransaction, Gilday was arrested.        Ziskind and Murray were also\n\nsubsequently arrested and indicted for their involvement in the\n\nscheme.\n\n           At   trial,   Ziskind   conceded   that   he   had   joined   the\n\nconspiracy with Murray and Gilday in 1995, but left the conspiracy\n\na few months later, and therefore had nothing to do with the 1997\n\nthefts.   Since the charges against Ziskind had a five-year statute\n\nof limitations, see 18 U.S.C. § 3282, he asserted that he was\n\nentitled to an acquittal because the statute of limitations had\n\nrun.\n\n           On appeal, Ziskind's only challenge to his conviction\n\nconcerns the admission of a stipulation that his co-conspirator,\n\nJohn Murray, had previously pleaded guilty to the counts of the\n\nindictment with which he was being charged.           Ziskind argues, on\n\nappeal, that the admission of this stipulation violated his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to confront adverse witnesses under Crawford              v.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fWashington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004). The government argues that Ziskind\n\nwaived this argument by agreeing to the stipulation or, at a\n\nminimum, forfeited it by not raising a Crawford-type claim below.2\n\nSee   United   States   v.   Olano,      507   U.S.   725,   733   (1993)\n\n(distinguishing between waiver and forfeiture).         Ziskind    claims\n\nthat he fully preserved the argument.          To put this standard of\n\nreview issue into context, some additional background is required.\n\n           Ten days before trial, the government filed a motion in\n\nlimine to admit Murray's plea allocution into evidence.              The\n\ndistrict court held a hearing on the motion, at which time Ziskind\n\nobjected to the introduction of the allocution.         He claimed that\n\nits admission presented \"a Bruton situation\" because the allocution\n\ncould implicate him in the crime.       See United States v. Smith, 46\n\nF.3d 1223, 1227 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"Bruton error occurs where the\n\ncodefendant's hearsay statement expressly implicates the defendant\n\n[in the crime] . . . .\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n           The district court found Ziskind's objection well-taken\n\nand proposed to the parties that, instead of introducing the\n\nallocution, they stipulate that Murray had previously pleaded\n\nguilty to the counts of the indictment with which Ziskind was\n\ncharged.   The court also promised to instruct the jury that the\n\n\n      2\n      We say \"Crawford-type\" claim because Crawford had not yet\nbeen decided when Ziskind was tried. This circumstance, however,\ndid not relieve Ziskind of raising an objection on the grounds\nlater embraced by Crawford. See United States v. Luciano, 414 F.3d\n174, 178 (1st Cir. 2005); see also United States v. Hadley, 431\nF.3d 484, 498 n.8 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n                                  -4-\n\fstipulation was not evidence that Ziskind had participated in the\n\nconspiracy. Ziskind's counsel stated that \"he probably would not\n\nhave an objection to that\" but \"that he would want to see the\n\nwording.\"   Later in the hearing, Ziskind's counsel reiterated that\n\nhe would \"have no objection as long as Mr. Ziskind's name is kept\n\nout,\" but that he would \"object to . . . the use of his name as\n\nbeing involved in the conspiracy.\"     Thus, counsel again aired his\n\nBruton objection.\n\n            At the end of the government's case, it introduced the\n\nstipulation, which stated, \"The parties hereby stipulate and agree\n\nthat on July 1, 2002 John Murray, AKA \"Mick\" Murray pled guilty to\n\nhis participation in the conspiracy alleged in Count 1 and to the\n\nthefts alleged in Counts Two and Three.\"        The stipulation was\n\nsigned by Ziskind and his counsel, and Ziskind did not object upon\n\nits admission.      The district court did not offer a limiting\n\ninstruction concerning the use of the stipulation at this juncture.\n\n            After the jury retired to deliberate, it asked to see the\n\nstipulation.    At that time, the district court consulted with the\n\nparties, and Ziskind's counsel restated his concern about the\n\nBruton problem, asking that, if the stipulation went to the jury,\n\nthe jury also be told that the stipulation does not prove Ziskind's\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy.    The court questioned whether there\n\nhad ever been an objection to the stipulation, to which Ziskind's\n\ncounsel replied,    \"I know I argued to you [that] this is Bruton.\"\n\nThe court then recalled that objection, and Ziskind proceeded to\n\n                                 -5-\n\ftry to broaden it by claiming that the objection was not limited to\n\nBruton.   Rather, according to Ziskind's counsel, the objection was\n\nto the admission of the stipulation in its entirety because he did\n\nnot have the chance to cross-examine Murray about the plea. Before\n\nproviding a copy of the stipulation to the jury, the court provided\n\na limiting instruction stating that the stipulation could be used\n\nas evidence that a conspiracy existed in 1997 but not that Ziskind\n\nhad been involved.\n\n           The   government's   contention   that   Ziskind   waived   his\n\nCrawford objection by agreeing to the stipulation poses a difficult\n\nquestion. On the one hand, no contemporaneous objection was lodged\n\nwhen the signed stipulation was admitted into evidence.           On the\n\nother hand, throughout the proceeding, Ziskind claimed that the\n\nadmission of the stipulation presented a possible Bruton problem to\n\nthe extent that it implicated Ziskind in the conspiracy.         Waiver,\n\nwhich ordinarily precludes any appellate consideration of an issue,\n\nrequires a showing that the party intentionally relinquished or\n\nabandoned an argument.    See United States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d\n\n435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).        The record can be read to support\n\nZiskind's contention that he did not agree, without reservation, to\n\nthe admissibility of the stipulation.    Thus, a reasonable argument\n\ncould be made, that Ziskind at least preserved an objection to the\n\nstipulation under Bruton and did not intentionally relinquish any\n\nappellate argument concerning the stipulation.\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            But,    regardless     of    whether        a   Bruton       objection   was\n\npreserved, Ziskind has not argued Bruton on appeal.                         Instead, he\n\nhas   argued       that     the   admission        of       the        stipulation   was\n\nunconstitutional          under   Crawford     because            it     permitted   the\n\nintroduction of testimonial hearsay.               It is settled law in this\n\ncircuit   \"that     an    objection     on   one   ground         does    not   preserve\n\nappellate review of a different ground.\" United States v. Mercado,\n\n412 F.3d 243, 247 (1st Cir. 2005).             No Crawford-type argument was\n\nmade either during the pre-trial hearing when the stipulation\n\nprocedure   was     discussed     or    when   the      government         offered   the\n\nstipulation at the close of its case.                   Indeed, at the pretrial\n\nhearing, Ziskind expressly stated that he had no objection to the\n\nadmission of the stipulation so long as his name did not appear and\n\nhe signed the stipulation that was eventually read to the jury.\n\nZiskind did make something resembling a Crawford-type argument at\n\nthe end of the discussion about the jury's request to see the\n\nstipulation; but at that point, it was too late.                       See United States\n\nv. DeLeon, 187 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 1999) (concluding that\n\nobjection to admission of evidence is not preserved for appellate\n\nreview where the objection is not made until after the introduction\n\nof the evidence); United States v. Tse, 135 F.3d 200, 209 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (similar).         Thus, Ziskind's Crawford argument is forfeited,\n\nand we therefore review it only for plain error.\n\n            To warrant reversal of his conviction, Ziskind must show:\n\n(1) the occurrence of an error; (2) that the error is obvious or\n\n                                        -7-\n\fclear   under     current    law;      (3)    that    the    error     affected   his\n\nsubstantial     rights;     and   (4)    that    it     seriously      impaired   the\n\nfairness,     integrity,     or     public      reputation       of    the    judicial\n\nproceedings.      See United States v. Turbides-Leonardo, 468 F.3d 34,\n\n38 (1st Cir. 2006).       As we explain below, Ziskind is not entitled\n\nto relief under this standard of review.\n\n            In Crawford, the Supreme Court overruled prior precedent\n\nto hold that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment\n\nprohibits   the    government     from       introducing     testimonial      hearsay\n\nagainst a defendant in a criminal trial.                 Crawford, however, was\n\nnot decided until after Ziskind's trial, and the district court\n\nrecognized, in an order rejecting Ziskind's post-trial motion to\n\nstay the execution of his sentence, that if Crawford had been the\n\ngoverning   law    at   trial,    it    would    have    ruled      the   stipulation\n\ninadmissible.      On appeal, the government has not argued that the\n\nstipulation was admissible under Crawford.                   We therefore assume\n\nthat Ziskind has met the first two prongs of the plain error\n\nstandard.    See Johnson v. United States,              520 U.S. 461, 468 (1997)\n\n(holding that error is plain if the law is clear at the time of\n\ndirect appellate review, even though governing law was unclear at\n\ntime of trial).\n\n            We turn then to whether the admission of the stipulation\n\naffected    Ziskind's     substantial        rights.        Under     this   standard,\n\nZiskind has to show that \"the error . . . affected the outcome of\n\nthe district court proceedings.\" United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S.\n\n                                         -8-\n\f625, 632 (2002).        Ziskind contends that the admission of the\n\nstipulation     was   critical   evidence      in    the   case   because   the\n\ngovernment used it to undermine his claim that he had withdrawn\n\nfrom the conspiracy before 1997.          In this regard, he relies on a\n\nportion of the government's closing argument, stating:\n\n          You also know [the conspiracy] continued\n          because, as you know from the stipulation, Mick\n          Murray pleaded guilty to stealing both the Navy\n          shipment and the Osicom shipment in 1997,\n          Counts 2 and 3 of this Indictment. Now, as you\n          know, the fact that Murray pleaded guilty to\n          stealing these packages or being involved in\n          the thefts doesn't mean that the defendant was.\n          But it does tell you that Murray was -- that\n          these packages were stolen as part of a\n          conspiracy involving Mick Murray and that\n          therefore they were stolen as part of a\n          conspiracy involving Mick Murray. And because\n          Murray was an original member of this\n          conspiracy, you know the conspiracy was\n          continuing in 1997.\n\n          The     government's    use     of   the    stipulation    was    not\n\nsufficiently important for us to conclude that it likely affected\n\nthe outcome of the trial.          Ziskind did not seriously contest\n\nMurray's involvement in the conspiracy from 1995 to 1997, which\n\nincluded the Navy and Osicom robberies.               His defense was that,\n\nwhile these robberies took place as part of a conspiracy that\n\nexisted in 1997, he was not then involved.            The government relied\n\non the stipulation only to argue that a conspiracy existed in 1997,\n\ninvolving these robberies.         It emphasized, however, that the\n\nstipulation was not evidence that Ziskind was involved in these\n\ncrimes.   The limited significance of the stipulation was also\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fstressed     by    the   district   court   in    its   supplemental   jury\n\ninstructions.       The court told the jury that it could \"use [the\n\nstipulation] as evidence, first, that a conspiracy existed; and,\n\nsecond, that the thefts there were alleged in Counts 2 and 3 took\n\nplace.   But [it cannot] use it to show somehow that Mr. Ziskind was\n\ninvolved.\"        See Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206 (1987)\n\n(stating that there is an \"almost invariable assumption of the law\n\nthat jurors follow their instructions\").           Thus, the jury was well\n\naware that it could not consider the stipulation in deciding the\n\ncentral issue -- whether Ziskind was involved in the conspiracy\n\nthrough 1997.\n\n           There was, however, ample evidence demonstrating that\n\nZiskind was involved through 1997.               The government presented\n\ntestimony from Gilday directly implicating Ziskind in the 1997\n\nrobberies and this testimony was partially corroborated by Powell.\n\nThere was also documentary evidence of telephone calls between\n\nGilday and Ziskind in 1997.         And Michael Servideo, another UPS\n\ndriver, testified that Ziskind tried to recruit him into the\n\nconspiracy in 1997 by offering him $2,000.\n\n           In sum, the stipulation was used for a limited purpose on\n\na point that Ziskind did not seriously contest. The government and\n\nthe district court both advised the jury on the limited purpose for\n\nwhich the stipulation could be used, and the government presented\n\na strong case demonstrating that Ziskind participated in the\n\nconspiracy through 1997.       Under these circumstances, we conclude\n\n                                    -10-\n\fthat Ziskind has not shown that the introduction of the stipulation\n\naffected his substantial rights, and therefore there is no basis\n\nfor reversing his conviction.               Cf. United States v. Reifler, 446\n\nF.3d    65,    87    (2d   Cir.    2006)    (finding     Crawford    error    in    the\n\nintroduction of co-conspirator's plea allocution harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt in a RICO prosecution where it was used only to\n\nshow    the    existence      of    an     enterprise,     not   the    defendant's\n\nparticipation).\n\n              We turn now to Ziskind's challenges to his sentence.\n\nZiskind was sentenced under Sentencing Guidelines in effect in\n\nNovember 1998 and before United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005), rendered the Guidelines advisory.                  Ziskind's presentence\n\nreport (PSR) recommended a base offense level of four, increased by\n\nthirteen levels for losses from relevant conduct beginning in 1995.\n\nThe    PSR    also   recommended      a    three-level    enhancement       based    on\n\nZiskind's leadership role in the conspiracy, see U.S.S.G. 3B1.1(b),\n\nand a four-level enhancement for receiving stolen property while in\n\nthat    business,      see    id.    §     2B1.1(b)(1)(B).          Under    the    PSR\n\ncalculation, Ziskind's guideline range was 63 to 78 months of\n\nimprisonment.\n\n              Ziskind raised several objections to the PSR, including\n\nthe calculation of the amount of loss, the role-in-the-offense\n\nenhancement, and the \"being in the business of receiving stolen\n\nproperty\" enhancement.            The court reduced the loss calculation to\n\nprovide for only a ten-level enhancement.                In so doing, it counted\n\n                                           -11-\n\flosses from the two 1997 thefts and one theft that occurred in\n\n1996.      The court also rejected the challenge to the \"in the\n\nbusiness\"    enhancement   and    increased    the    role-in-the-offense\n\nenhancement to four levels based on the view that Ziskind was\n\nextensively involved in managing the conspiracy and that the\n\nconspiracy involved more than five participants.             The resulting\n\nguideline sentencing range (GSR) was 51 to 63 months.\n\n            The district court sentenced Ziskind to 63 months of\n\nimprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently.            The court\n\nexplained its sentencing rationale as follows:\n\n            I am going to impose the high end of the\n            Guidelines. And, in fact, I gave very serious\n            consideration to whether or not I should exceed\n            them.    But I have given fairly detailed\n            consideration to evaluation of loss at the\n            front end -- that is, in the calculation of the\n            relevant total offense level. And my concern\n            was that I not enervate that kind of evaluation\n            by a separate back-door evaluation of the scope\n            of the offense.     So, I have chosen not to\n            depart here, although there is in this case a\n            fairly    substantial   amount    of   evidence\n            suggesting that the loss that I've calculated\n            does not completely capture all of the\n            defendant's activities. I have also considered\n            the question of this stale criminal record and\n            determined that it would be inappropriate for\n            me to import the prior convictions that are\n            outside of the range that the Guidelines take\n            into consideration into my evaluation of\n            whether or not to depart here. Again, those\n            are close questions in this case, but not ones\n            that have ultimately caused me to depart.\n\n            Ziskind's first challenge to his sentence is to the\n\ndistrict    court's   inclusion   of   the    1996   theft   in   its   loss\n\ncalculation on the ground that this conduct took place outside the\n\n                                  -12-\n\ffive-year statute of limitations for the charged offenses.                In\n\nmaking    this   argument,   Ziskind   relies   on   the   Supreme   Court's\n\ndecisions in Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607 (2003), and\n\nBooker.    We review this challenge to the guideline calculation de\n\nnovo as it presents a question of law.               See United States v.\n\nTalladino, 38 F.3d 1255,      1263 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            Stogner is irrelevant. In that case, the Court held that\n\na California statute that restarted the limitations period for sex-\n\nrelated child abuse offenses to one year from the time that the\n\ncrime was reported to police was unconstitutionally ex post facto.\n\nStogner does not concern a court's ability to consider relevant\n\nconduct occurring outside the statute of limitations period for\n\nsentencing the defendant for a crime that took place within the\n\nstatute of limitations period, and we have been shown no case\n\nsuggesting its relevance.          Moreover, consideration of conduct\n\ntaking place outside the limitations period for sentencing purposes\n\nhas been held not to be punishment and thus ex post facto concerns\n\nare inapposite.      See United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 155\n\n(1997)     (\"Consideration    of   information   about     the   defendant's\n\ncharacter and conduct at sentencing does not result in punishment\n\nfor any offense other than the one of which the defendant was\n\nconvicted.\")\n\n            It was well-established prior to Booker that a district\n\ncourt may consider relevant conduct outside of the statute of\n\nlimitations period in fashioning the defendant's sentence.              See,\n\n                                   -13-\n\fe.g., United States v. Williams, 217 F.3d 751, 754 (9th Cir. 2000);\n\nUnited States v. Stephens, 198 F.3d 389, 390-91 (3d Cir. 1999);\n\nUnited States v. Valenti, 121 F.3d          327, 334 (7th Cir. 1997);\n\nUnited States v. Behr, 93 F.3d 764, 765-66 (11th Cir. 1996) (per\n\ncuriam); United States v. Silkowski, 32 F.3d 682, 688 (2d Cir.\n\n1994); United States v. Neighbors, 23 F.3d 306, 311 (10th Cir.\n\n1994); United States v. Pierce, 17 F.3d 146, 150 (6th Cir. 1994).\n\nZiskind contends, however, that Booker undermines this rule because\n\nthe jury did not find that he actually committed the conduct\n\noutside of the statute of limitations period which the court used\n\nto increase his sentence.\n\n            This argument misconstrues the holding in Booker. Booker\n\ndid   not   hold   that   the   Sixth    Amendment   prohibits   judicial\n\nfactfinding; it held only that the Sixth Amendment is violated by\n\na mandatory guideline sentence scheme predicated on such factual\n\ndeterminations.    See United States v. De Los Santos, 420 F.3d 10,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68,\n\n75 (1st Cir. 2005).        Thus, we have consistently rejected the\n\nargument that judicial factfinding, by itself, violates Booker.\n\nE.g., United States v. Bermudez, 407 F.3d 536, 545 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nUnited States v. Lewis, 406 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir. 2005).             And\n\nconsistent with this view, courts of appeals after Booker have\n\ncontinued to uphold the district court's reliance on relevant\n\nconduct outside of the limitations period in setting a sentence.\n\nSee United States v. Hamaker, 455 F.3d 1316, 1336 (11th Cir. 2006);\n\n                                  -14-\n\fUnited States v. Greer, 175 Fed. Appx. 95-96 (7th Cir. 2006).\n\nAccordingly, Ziskind's argument that the district court erred in\n\nconsidering relevant conduct outside the statute of limitations\n\nperiod in fashioning his sentence fails.\n\n              Ziskind next challenges the district court's imposition\n\nof a four-level role-in-the-offense enhancement.                   He argues that\n\nthis       enhancement       was   inappropriately       applied    because      his\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy was limited to identifying \"what sort\n\nof   stolen    goods     could     be   readily   marketed.\"       We   review   the\n\nimposition of a role-in-the-offense enhancement for clear error.\n\nSee United States v. Rodriguez Alvarado, 985 F.2d 15, 19-20 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n              Section 3B1.1(a) of the Guidelines prescribes offense-\n\nlevel enhancements based upon the size of the criminal organization\n\nand the defendant's role in the offense.                A four-level enhancement\n\napplies      where     the     defendant    engages      in    a   leadership     or\n\norganizational role for criminal activity that involved five or\n\nmore people.      Id.     The Guidelines provide a nonexclusive list of\n\nfactors to guide the determination of whether a defendant held a\n\nleadership or organizational role.3               Id.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n     These include: the exercise of decision making authority; the\nnature of the participation in the commission of the offense; the\nclaimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; the\ndegree of participation in planning or organizing the offense; the\nnature and scope of the illegal activity; and the degree of control\nand authority exercised over others. Id. at cmt. 4.\n\n                                          -15-\n\f              The record easily supports the district court's decision\n\nto apply the four-level enhancement.               There was evidence that\n\nZiskind conceived of the scheme; actively recruited participants;\n\nexercised control over the operation by deciding what goods to\n\nsteal; and controlled the payout of money earned by the scheme to\n\nother participants.       See generally United States v. Monteiro, 417\n\nF.3d 208,      212-13 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              Next, Ziskind argues that he is entitled to remand for\n\nresentencing under Booker because he was sentenced pursuant to the\n\npre-Booker mandatory guideline regime.             Ziskind concedes that he\n\ndid not preserve this argument, and therefore review is limited to\n\nplain error.     Under plain error review, a defendant sentenced pre-\n\nBooker   is    entitled   to   resentencing   if    he   can   demonstrate   \"a\n\nreasonable probability that he would have received a more lenient\n\nsentence under an advisory guideline regime.\"              United States v.\n\nMartins, 413 F.3d 139, 154 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              Ziskind cannot make the necessary showing.         The district\n\ncourt sentenced him at the high end of the applicable GSR, a fact\n\nthat indicates     a remote possibility of a below guideline sentence\n\non remand.      See United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 505 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).      Moreover, at sentencing, the district court stated\n\nthat it \"gave very serious consideration\" to imposing a sentence\n\nabove the GSR. Addressing Ziskind's motion to stay the execution of\n\nsentence, the district court also explicitly stated that \"the\n\nsentence imposed under the mandatory guidelines scheme would in all\n\n                                    -16-\n\flikelihood be the sentence [it] would impose under an advisory\n\nguidelines sentencing scheme.\"        On this record, there is no basis\n\nto conclude that Ziskind would be sentenced more leniently on\n\nremand.\n\n            Finally,     Ziskind contends that the district court erred\n\nin sentencing him to 63 months' imprisonment on the conspiracy\n\ncount   because   that    sentence    exceeded   the   60-month   statutory\n\nmaximum.    See 18 U.S.C. §371.      The government concedes this error,\n\nand we therefore vacate the sentence on the conspiracy count.\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we vacate the sentence on\n\nthe conspiracy count (Count 1) and remand for the imposition of a\n\n60-month sentence on this count.        The remainder of the judgment is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f",

A jury convicted Ziskind on all counts of the indictment, and he was sentenced to 63 months of imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Ziskind appeals his conviction and sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1995, Ziskind and his associate, John \"Mick\" Murray, devised a scheme to steal computer equipment from local United Parcel Service (UPS) shipments. They recruited, Daniel Gilday, a UPS worker, and told him to steal computer equipment and pass it along to Ziskind. Ziskind owned an electronics company through which he sold the stolen merchandise and shared a portion of the profits with Murray and Gilday. On several occasions, Ziskind searched some UPS trucks for merchandise himself and assisted Gilday in recruiting other UPS drivers for the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Gilday became disenchanted with his cut of the profits, so he found another buyer, Robert Powell, who paid better. On occasion, Gilday still provided goods to Ziskind and Murray. Soon, however, Ziskind noticed that Gilday's supply had diminished and complained to Gilday about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1997, Gilday stole a shipment of semiconductors that the United States Navy was returning to Alamo Computer in Massachusetts and delivered them to Murray. Ziskind initially claimed that the semiconductors were worthless but later learned that they were very valuable. This led to a dispute between Ziskind and Gilday, which Ziskind resolved by paying Gilday $5,000. In May 1997, Gilday stole a shipment of video cards from a company called Osicom Technology and, after unsuccessfully trying to sell them to Powell, sold them to Ziskind. Soon after this transaction, Gilday was arrested. Ziskind and Murray were also subsequently arrested and indicted for their involvement in the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Ziskind conceded that he had joined the conspiracy with Murray and Gilday in 1995, but left the conspiracy a few months later, and therefore had nothing to do with the 1997 thefts. Since the charges against Ziskind had a five-year statute of limitations, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3282, he asserted that he was entitled to an acquittal because the statute of limitations had run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ziskind's only challenge to his conviction concerns the admission of a stipulation that his co-conspirator, John Murray, had previously pleaded guilty to the counts of the indictment with which he was being charged. Ziskind argues, on appeal, that the admission of this stipulation violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses under <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The government argues that Ziskind waived this argument by agreeing to the stipulation or, at a minimum, forfeited it by not raising a <i>Crawford</i>-type claim below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (distinguishing between waiver and forfeiture). Ziskind claims that he fully preserved the argument. To put this standard of review issue into context, some additional background is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ten days before trial, the government filed a motion in limine to admit Murray's plea allocution into evidence. The district court held a hearing on the motion, at which time Ziskind objected to the introduction of the allocution. He claimed that its admission presented \"a <i>Bruton</i> situation\" because the allocution could implicate him in the crime. <i>See United States v. Smith,</i> 46 F.3d 1223, 1227 (1st Cir.1995) (\"<i>Bruton</i> error occurs where the codefendant's hearsay statement expressly implicates the defendant [in the crime] . . . .\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found Ziskind's objection well-taken and proposed to the parties that, instead of introducing the allocution, they stipulate that Murray had previously pleaded guilty to the counts of the indictment with which Ziskind was charged. The court also promised to instruct the jury that the stipulation was not evidence that Ziskind had participated in the conspiracy. Ziskind's counsel stated that \"he probably would not have an objection to that\" but \"that he would want to see the wording.\" Later in the hearing, Ziskind's counsel reiterated that he would \"have no objection as long as Mr. Ziskind's name is kept out,\" but that he would \"object to . . . the use of his name as being involved in the conspiracy.\" Thus, counsel again aired his <i>Bruton</i> objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the government's case, it introduced the stipulation, which stated, \"The parties hereby stipulate and agree that on July 1, 2002 John Murray, AKA `Mick' Murray pled guilty to his participation in the conspiracy alleged in Count 1 and to the thefts alleged in Counts Two and Three.\" The stipulation was signed by Ziskind and his counsel, and Ziskind did not object upon its admission. The district court did not offer a limiting instruction concerning the use of the stipulation at this juncture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury retired to deliberate, it asked to see the stipulation. At that time, the district court consulted with the parties, and Ziskind's counsel restated his concern about the <i>Bruton</i> problem, asking that, if the stipulation went to the jury, the jury also be told that the stipulation does not prove Ziskind's involvement in the conspiracy. The court questioned whether there had ever been an objection to the stipulation, to which Ziskind's counsel replied, \"I know I argued to you [that] this is <i>Bruton.</i>\" The court then recalled that objection, and Ziskind proceeded to try to broaden it by claiming that the objection was not limited to <i>Bruton.</i> Rather, according to Ziskind's counsel, the objection was to the admission of the stipulation in its entirety because he did not have the chance to cross-examine Murray about the plea. Before providing a copy of the stipulation to the jury, the court provided a limiting instruction stating that the stipulation could be used as evidence that a conspiracy existed in 1997 but not that Ziskind had been involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's contention that Ziskind waived his <i>Crawford</i> objection by agreeing to the stipulation poses a difficult question. On the one hand, no contemporaneous objection was lodged when the signed stipulation was admitted into evidence. On the other hand, throughout the proceeding, Ziskind claimed that the admission of the stipulation presented a possible <i>Bruton</i> problem to the extent that it implicated Ziskind in the conspiracy. Waiver, which ordinarily precludes any appellate consideration of an issue, requires a showing that the party intentionally relinquished or abandoned an argument. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002). The record can be read to support Ziskind's contention that he did not agree, without reservation, to the admissibility of the stipulation. Thus, a reasonable argument could be made, that Ziskind at least preserved an objection to the stipulation under <i>Bruton</i> and did not intentionally relinquish any appellate argument concerning the stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, regardless of whether a <i>Bruton</i> objection was preserved, Ziskind has not argued <i>Bruton</i> on appeal. Instead, he has argued that the admission of the stipulation was unconstitutional under <i>Crawford</i> because it permitted the introduction of testimonial hearsay. It is settled law in this circuit \"that an objection on one ground does not preserve appellate review of a different ground.\" <i>United States v. Mercado,</i> 412 F.3d 243, 247 (1st Cir.2005). No <i>Crawford</i>-type argument was made either during the pre-trial hearing when the stipulation procedure was discussed or when the government offered the stipulation at the close of its case. Indeed, at the pretrial hearing, Ziskind expressly stated that he had no objection to the admission of the stipulation so long as his name did not appear and he signed the stipulation that was eventually read to the jury. Ziskind did make something resembling a <i>Crawford</i>-type argument at the end of the discussion about the jury's request to see the stipulation; but at that point, it was too late. <i>See United States v. DeLeon,</i> 187 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.1999) (concluding that objection to admission of evidence is not preserved for appellate review where the objection is not made until after the introduction of the evidence); <i>United States v. Tse,</i> 135 F.3d 200, 209 (1st Cir.1998) (similar). Thus, Ziskind's <i>Crawford</i> argument is forfeited, and we therefore review it only for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To warrant reversal of his conviction, Ziskind must show: (1) the occurrence of an error; (2) that the error is obvious or clear under current law; (3) that the error affected his substantial rights; and (4) that it seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <i>See United States v. Turbides-Leonardo,</i> 468 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir.2006). As we explain below, Ziskind is not entitled to relief under this standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Crawford,</i> the Supreme Court overruled prior precedent to hold that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment prohibits the government from introducing testimonial hearsay against a defendant in a criminal trial. <i>Crawford,</i> however, was not decided until after Ziskind's trial, and the district court recognized, in an order rejecting Ziskind's post-trial motion to stay the execution of his sentence, that if <i>Crawford</i> had been the governing law at trial, it would have ruled the stipulation inadmissible. On appeal, the government has not argued that the stipulation was admissible under <i>Crawford.</i> We therefore assume that Ziskind has met the first two prongs of the plain error standard. <i>See Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (holding that error is plain if the law is clear at the time of direct appellate review, even though governing law was unclear at time of trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn then to whether the admission of the stipulation affected Ziskind's substantial rights. Under this standard, Ziskind has to show that \"the error . . . affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 632, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). Ziskind contends that the admission of the stipulation was critical evidence in the case because the government used it to undermine his claim that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy before 1997. In this regard, he relies on a portion of the government's closing argument, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You also know [the conspiracy] continued because, as you know from the stipulation, Mick Murray pleaded guilty to stealing both the Navy shipment and the Osicom shipment in 1997, Counts 2 and 3 of this Indictment. Now, as you know, the fact that Murray pleaded guilty to stealing these packages or being involved in the thefts doesn't mean that the defendant was. But it does tell you that Murray was &#8212; that these packages were stolen as part of a conspiracy involving Mick Murray and that therefore they were stolen as part of a conspiracy involving Mick Murray. And because Murray was an original member of this conspiracy, you know the conspiracy was continuing in 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's use of the stipulation was not sufficiently important for us to conclude that it likely affected the outcome of the trial. Ziskind did not seriously contest Murray's involvement in the conspiracy from 1995 to 1997, which included the Navy and Osicom robberies. His defense was that, while these robberies took place as part of a conspiracy that existed in 1997, he was not then involved. The government relied on the stipulation only to argue that a conspiracy existed in 1997, involving these robberies. It emphasized, however, that the stipulation was not evidence that Ziskind was involved in these crimes. The limited significance of the stipulation was also stressed by the district court in its supplemental jury instructions. The court told the jury that it could \"use [the stipulation] as evidence, first, that a conspiracy existed; and, second, that the thefts there were alleged in Counts 2 and 3 took place. But [it cannot] use it to show somehow that Mr. Ziskind was involved.\" <i>See Richardson v. Marsh,</i> 481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (stating that there is an \"almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions\"). Thus, the jury was well aware that it could not consider the stipulation in deciding the central issue &#8212; whether Ziskind was involved in the conspiracy through 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was, however, ample evidence demonstrating that Ziskind was involved through 1997. The government presented testimony from Gilday directly implicating Ziskind in the 1997 robberies and this testimony was partially corroborated by Powell. There was also documentary evidence of telephone calls between Gilday and Ziskind in 1997. And Michael Servideo, another UPS driver, testified that Ziskind tried to recruit him into the conspiracy in 1997 by offering him $2,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the stipulation was used for a limited purpose on a point that Ziskind did not seriously contest. The government and the district court both advised the jury on the limited purpose for which the stipulation could be used, and the government presented a strong case demonstrating that Ziskind participated in the conspiracy through 1997. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Ziskind has not shown that the introduction of the stipulation affected his substantial rights, and therefore there is no basis for reversing his conviction. <i>Cf. United States v. Reifler,</i> 446 F.3d 65, 87 (2d Cir.2006) (finding <i>Crawford</i> error in the introduction of co-conspirator's plea allocution harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in a RICO prosecution where it was used only to show the existence of an enterprise, not the defendant's participation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to Ziskind's challenges to his sentence. Ziskind was sentenced under Sentencing Guidelines in effect in November 1998 and before <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the Guidelines advisory. Ziskind's presentence report (PSR) recommended a base offense level of four, increased by thirteen levels for losses from relevant conduct beginning in 1995. The PSR also recommended a three-level enhancement based on Ziskind's leadership role in the conspiracy, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. 3B1.1(b), and a four-level enhancement for receiving stolen property while in that business, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2B1.1(b)(1)(B). Under the PSR calculation, Ziskind's guideline range was 63 to 78 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ziskind raised several objections to the PSR, including the calculation of the amount of loss, the role-in-the-offense enhancement, and the \"being in the business of receiving stolen property\" enhancement. The court reduced the loss calculation to provide for only a ten-level enhancement. In so doing, it counted losses from the two 1997 thefts and one theft that occurred in 1996. The court also rejected the challenge to the \"in the business\" enhancement and increased the role-in-the-offense enhancement to four levels based on the view that Ziskind was extensively involved in managing the conspiracy and that the conspiracy involved more than five participants. The resulting guideline sentencing range (GSR) was 51 to 63 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Ziskind to 63 months of imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. The court explained its sentencing rationale as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am going to impose the high end of the Guidelines. And, in fact, I gave very serious consideration to whether or not I should exceed them. But I have given fairly detailed consideration to evaluation of loss at the front end &#8212; that is, in the calculation of the relevant total offense level. And my concern was that I not enervate that kind of evaluation by a separate back-door evaluation of the scope of the offense. So, I have chosen not to depart here, although there is in this case a fairly substantial amount of evidence suggesting that the loss that I've calculated does not completely capture all of the defendant's activities. I have also considered the question of this stale criminal record and determined that it would be inappropriate for me to import the prior convictions that are outside of the range that the Guidelines take into consideration into my evaluation of whether or not to depart here. Again, those are close questions in this case, but not ones that have ultimately caused me to depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ziskind's first challenge to his sentence is to the district court's inclusion of the 1996 theft in its loss calculation on the ground that this conduct took place outside the five-year statute of limitations for the charged offenses. In making this argument, Ziskind relies on the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Stogner v. California,</i> 539 U.S. 607, 123 S.Ct. 2446, 156 L.Ed.2d 544 (2003), and <i>Booker.</i> We review this challenge to the guideline calculation de novo as it presents a question of law. <i>See United States v. Talladino,</i> 38 F.3d 1255, 1263 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Stogner</i> is irrelevant. In that case, the Court held that a California statute that restarted the limitations period for sex-related child abuse offenses to one year from the time that the crime was reported to police was unconstitutionally ex post facto. <i>Stogner</i> does not concern a court's ability to consider relevant conduct occurring outside the statute of limitations period for sentencing the defendant for a crime that took place within the statute of limitations period, and we have been shown no case suggesting its relevance. Moreover, consideration of conduct taking place outside the limitations period for sentencing purposes has been held not to be punishment and thus ex post facto concerns are inapposite. <i>See United States v. Watts,</i> 519 U.S. 148, 155, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997) (\"Consideration of information about the defendant's character and conduct at sentencing does not result in punishment for any offense other than the one of which the defendant was convicted.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was well-established prior to <i>Booker</i> that a district court may consider relevant conduct outside of the statute of limitations period in fashioning the defendant's sentence. <i>See, e.g., United States v.</i> <i>Williams,</i> 217 F.3d 751, 754 (9th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Stephens,</i> 198 F.3d 389, 390-91 (3d Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Valenti,</i> 121 F.3d 327, 334 (7th Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Behr,</i> 93 F.3d 764, 765-66 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam); <i>United States v. Silkowski,</i> 32 F.3d 682, 688 (2d Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Neighbors,</i> 23 F.3d 306, 311 (10th Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Pierce,</i> 17 F.3d 146, 150 (6th Cir.1994). Ziskind contends, however, that <i>Booker</i> undermines this rule because the jury did not find that he actually committed the conduct outside of the statute of limitations period which the court used to increase his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument misconstrues the holding in <i>Booker. Booker</i> did not hold that the Sixth Amendment prohibits judicial factfinding; it held only that the Sixth Amendment is violated by a mandatory guideline sentence scheme predicated on such factual determinations. <i>See United States v. De Los Santos,</i> 420 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2005); <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005). Thus, we have consistently rejected the argument that judicial factfinding, by itself, violates <i>Booker. E.g., United States v. Bermudez,</i> 407 F.3d 536, 545 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Lewis,</i> 406 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir. 2005). And consistent with this view, courts of appeals after <i>Booker</i> have continued to uphold the district court's reliance on relevant conduct outside of the limitations period in setting a sentence. <i>See United States v. Hamaker,</i> 455 F.3d 1316, 1336 (11th Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Greer,</i> 175 Fed.Appx. 95, 96 (7th Cir.2006). Accordingly, Ziskind's argument that the district court erred in considering relevant conduct outside the statute of limitations period in fashioning his sentence fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ziskind next challenges the district court's imposition of a four-level role-in-the-offense enhancement. He argues that this enhancement was inappropriately applied because his involvement in the conspiracy was limited to identifying \"what sort of stolen goods could be readily marketed.\" We review the imposition of a role-in-the-offense enhancement for clear error. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez Alvarado,</i> 985 F.2d 15, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3B1.1(a) of the Guidelines prescribes offense-level enhancements based upon the size of the criminal organization and the defendant's role in the offense. A four-level enhancement applies where the defendant engages in a leadership or organizational role for criminal activity that involved five or more people. <i>Id.</i> The Guidelines provide a nonexclusive list of factors to guide the determination of whether a defendant held a leadership or organizational role.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record easily supports the district court's decision to apply the four-level enhancement. There was evidence that Ziskind conceived of the scheme; actively recruited participants; exercised control over the operation by deciding what goods to steal; and controlled the payout of money earned by the scheme to other participants. <i>See generally United States v. Monteiro,</i> 417 F.3d 208, 212-13 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Ziskind argues that he is entitled to remand for resentencing under <i>Booker</i> because he was sentenced pursuant to the pre-<i>Booker</i> mandatory guideline regime. Ziskind concedes that he did not preserve this argument, and therefore review is limited to plain error. Under plain error review, a defendant sentenced pre-<i>Booker</i> is entitled to resentencing if he can demonstrate \"a reasonable probability that he would have received a more lenient sentence under an advisory guideline regime.\" <i>United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139, 154 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ziskind cannot make the necessary showing. The district court sentenced him at the high end of the applicable GSR, a fact that indicates a remote possibility of a below guideline sentence on remand. <i>See United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 505 (1st Cir.2005). Moreover, at sentencing, the district court stated that it \"gave very serious consideration\" to imposing a sentence above the GSR. Addressing Ziskind's motion to stay the execution of sentence, the district court also explicitly stated that \"the sentence imposed under the mandatory guidelines scheme would in all likelihood be the sentence [it] would impose under an advisory guidelines sentencing scheme.\" On this record, there is no basis to conclude that Ziskind would be sentenced more leniently on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Ziskind contends that the district court erred in sentencing him to 63 months' imprisonment on the conspiracy count because that sentence exceeded the 60-month statutory maximum. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371. The government concedes this error, and we therefore vacate the sentence on the conspiracy count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we <i>vacate</i> the sentence on the conspiracy count (Count 1) and <i>remand</i> for the imposition of a 60-month sentence on this count. The remainder of the judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We recently rejected another appeal from Ziskind in a criminal prosecution involving a different theft conspiracy<i>See United States v.

A jury convicted Ziskind on all counts of the indictment, and he was sentenced to 63 months of imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Ziskind appeals his conviction and sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1995, Ziskind and his associate, John \"Mick\" Murray, devised a scheme to steal computer equipment from local United Parcel Service (UPS) shipments. They recruited, Daniel Gilday, a UPS worker, and told him to steal computer equipment and pass it along to Ziskind. Ziskind owned an electronics company through which he sold the stolen merchandise and shared a portion of the profits with Murray and Gilday. On several occasions, Ziskind searched some UPS trucks for merchandise himself and assisted Gilday in recruiting other UPS drivers for the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Gilday became disenchanted with his cut of the profits, so he found another buyer, Robert Powell, who paid better. On occasion, Gilday still provided goods to Ziskind and Murray. Soon, however, Ziskind noticed that Gilday's supply had diminished and complained to Gilday about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1997, Gilday stole a shipment of semiconductors that the United States Navy was returning to Alamo Computer in Massachusetts and delivered them to Murray. Ziskind initially claimed that the semiconductors were worthless but later learned that they were very valuable. This led to a dispute between Ziskind and Gilday, which Ziskind resolved by paying Gilday $5,000. In May 1997, Gilday stole a shipment of video cards from a company called Osicom Technology and, after unsuccessfully trying to sell them to Powell, sold them to Ziskind. Soon after this transaction, Gilday was arrested. Ziskind and Murray were also subsequently arrested and indicted for their involvement in the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Ziskind conceded that he had joined the conspiracy with Murray and Gilday in 1995, but left the conspiracy a few months later, and therefore had nothing to do with the 1997 thefts. Since the charges against Ziskind had a five-year statute of limitations, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3282, he asserted that he was entitled to an acquittal because the statute of limitations had run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ziskind's only challenge to his conviction concerns the admission of a stipulation that his co-conspirator, John Murray, had previously pleaded guilty to the counts of the indictment with which he was being charged. Ziskind argues, on appeal, that the admission of this stipulation violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses under <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span> (2004). The government argues that Ziskind waived this argument by agreeing to the stipulation or, at a minimum, forfeited it by not raising a <i>Crawford</i>-type claim below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 733, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993) (distinguishing between waiver and forfeiture). Ziskind claims that he fully preserved the argument. To put this standard of review issue into context, some additional background is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ten days before trial, the government filed a motion in limine to admit Murray's plea allocution into evidence. The district court held a hearing on the motion, at which time Ziskind objected to the introduction of the allocution. He claimed that its admission presented \"a <i>Bruton</i> situation\" because the allocution could implicate him in the crime. <i>See United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195903\"><a href=\"/opinion/195903/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span>, 1227 (1st Cir.1995) (\"<i>Bruton</i> error occurs where the codefendant's hearsay statement expressly implicates the defendant [in the crime] . . . .\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found Ziskind's objection well-taken and proposed to the parties that, instead of introducing the allocution, they stipulate that Murray had previously pleaded guilty to the counts of the indictment with which Ziskind was charged. The court also promised to instruct the jury that the stipulation was not evidence that Ziskind had participated in the conspiracy. Ziskind's counsel stated that \"he probably would not have an objection to that\" but \"that he would want to see the wording.\" Later in the hearing, Ziskind's counsel reiterated that he would \"have no objection as long as Mr. Ziskind's name is kept out,\" but that he would \"object to . . . the use of his name as being involved in the conspiracy.\" Thus, counsel again aired his <i>Bruton</i> objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the government's case, it introduced the stipulation, which stated, \"The parties hereby stipulate and agree that on July 1, 2002 John Murray, AKA `Mick' Murray pled guilty to his participation in the conspiracy alleged in Count 1 and to the thefts alleged in Counts Two and Three.\" The stipulation was signed by Ziskind and his counsel, and Ziskind did not object upon its admission. The district court did not offer a limiting instruction concerning the use of the stipulation at this juncture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury retired to deliberate, it asked to see the stipulation. At that time, the district court consulted with the parties, and Ziskind's counsel restated his concern about the <i>Bruton</i> problem, asking that, if the stipulation went to the jury, the jury also be told that the stipulation does not prove Ziskind's involvement in the conspiracy. The court questioned whether there had ever been an objection to the stipulation, to which Ziskind's counsel replied, \"I know I argued to you [that] this is <i>Bruton.</i>\" The court then recalled that objection, and Ziskind proceeded to try to broaden it by claiming that the objection was not limited to <i>Bruton.</i> Rather, according to Ziskind's counsel, the objection was to the admission of the stipulation in its entirety because he did not have the chance to cross-examine Murray about the plea. Before providing a copy of the stipulation to the jury, the court provided a limiting instruction stating that the stipulation could be used as evidence that a conspiracy existed in 1997 but not that Ziskind had been involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's contention that Ziskind waived his <i>Crawford</i> objection by agreeing to the stipulation poses a difficult question. On the one hand, no contemporaneous objection was lodged when the signed stipulation was admitted into evidence. On the other hand, throughout the proceeding, Ziskind claimed that the admission of the stipulation presented a possible <i>Bruton</i> problem to the extent that it implicated Ziskind in the conspiracy. Waiver, which ordinarily precludes any appellate consideration of an issue, requires a showing that the party intentionally relinquished or abandoned an argument. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200202\"><a href=\"/opinion/200202/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 437 (1st Cir.2002). The record can be read to support Ziskind's contention that he did not agree, without reservation, to the admissibility of the stipulation. Thus, a reasonable argument could be made, that Ziskind at least preserved an objection to the stipulation under <i>Bruton</i> and did not intentionally relinquish any appellate argument concerning the stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, regardless of whether a <i>Bruton</i> objection was preserved, Ziskind has not argued <i>Bruton</i> on appeal. Instead, he has argued that the admission of the stipulation was unconstitutional under <i>Crawford</i> because it permitted the introduction of testimonial hearsay. It is settled law in this circuit \"that an objection on one ground does not preserve appellate review of a different ground.\" <i>United States v. Mercado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790686\"><a href=\"/opinion/790686/united-states-v-luis-mercado/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span>, 247 (1st Cir.2005). No <i>Crawford</i>-type argument was made either during the pre-trial hearing when the stipulation procedure was discussed or when the government offered the stipulation at the close of its case. Indeed, at the pretrial hearing, Ziskind expressly stated that he had no objection to the admission of the stipulation so long as his name did not appear and he signed the stipulation that was eventually read to the jury. Ziskind did make something resembling a <i>Crawford</i>-type argument at the end of the discussion about the jury's request to see the stipulation; but at that point, it was too late. <i>See United States v. DeLeon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198562\"><a href=\"/opinion/198562/united-states-v-deleon/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.1999) (concluding that objection to admission of evidence is not preserved for appellate review where the objection is not made until after the introduction of the evidence); <i>United States v.

Thus, Ziskind's <i>Crawford</i> argument is forfeited, and we therefore review it only for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To warrant reversal of his conviction, Ziskind must show: (1) the occurrence of an error; (2) that the error is obvious or clear under current law; (3) that the error affected his substantial rights; and (4) that it seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <i>See United States v. Turbides-Leonardo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202495\"><a href=\"/opinion/202495/united-states-v-turbides-leonardo/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2006). As we explain below, Ziskind is not entitled to relief under this standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Crawford,</i> the Supreme Court overruled prior precedent to hold that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment prohibits the government from introducing testimonial hearsay against a defendant in a criminal trial. <i>Crawford,</i> however, was not decided until after Ziskind's trial, and the district court recognized, in an order rejecting Ziskind's post-trial motion to stay the execution of his sentence, that if <i>Crawford</i> had been the governing law at trial, it would have ruled the stipulation inadmissible. On appeal, the government has not argued that the stipulation was admissible under <i>Crawford.</i> We therefore assume that Ziskind has met the first two prongs of the plain error standard. <i>See Johnson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 468, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under this standard, Ziskind has to show that \"the error . . . affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>, 632, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span> (2002). Ziskind contends that the admission of the stipulation was critical evidence in the case because the government used it to undermine his claim that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy before 1997. In this regard, he relies on a portion of the government's closing argument, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You also know [the conspiracy] continued because, as you know from the stipulation, Mick Murray pleaded guilty to stealing both the Navy shipment and the Osicom shipment in 1997, Counts 2 and 3 of this Indictment. Now, as you know, the fact that Murray pleaded guilty to stealing these packages or being involved in the thefts doesn't mean that the defendant was. But it does tell you that Murray was &#8212; that these packages were stolen as part of a conspiracy involving Mick Murray and that therefore they were stolen as part of a conspiracy involving Mick Murray. And because Murray was an original member of this conspiracy, you know the conspiracy was continuing in 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's use of the stipulation was not sufficiently important for us to conclude that it likely affected the outcome of the trial. Ziskind did not seriously contest Murray's involvement in the conspiracy from 1995 to 1997, which included the Navy and Osicom robberies. His defense was that, while these robberies took place as part of a conspiracy that existed in 1997, he was not then involved. The government relied on the stipulation only to argue that a conspiracy existed in 1997, involving these robberies. It emphasized, however, that the stipulation was not evidence that Ziskind was involved in these crimes. The limited significance of the stipulation was also stressed by the district court in its supplemental jury instructions. The court told the jury that it could \"use [the stipulation] as evidence, first, that a conspiracy existed; and, second, that the thefts there were alleged in Counts 2 and 3 took place. But [it cannot] use it to show somehow that Mr. Ziskind was involved.\" <i>See Richardson v. Marsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 206, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span> (1987) (stating that there is an \"almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions\"). Thus, the jury was well aware that it could not consider the stipulation in deciding the central issue &#8212; whether Ziskind was involved in the conspiracy through 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was, however, ample evidence demonstrating that Ziskind was involved through 1997. The government presented testimony from Gilday directly implicating Ziskind in the 1997 robberies and this testimony was partially corroborated by Powell. There was also documentary evidence of telephone calls between Gilday and Ziskind in 1997. And Michael Servideo, another UPS driver, testified that Ziskind tried to recruit him into the conspiracy in 1997 by offering him $2,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the stipulation was used for a limited purpose on a point that Ziskind did not seriously contest. The government and the district court both advised the jury on the limited purpose for which the stipulation could be used, and the government presented a strong case demonstrating that Ziskind participated in the conspiracy through 1997. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Ziskind has not shown that the introduction of the stipulation affected his substantial rights, and therefore there is no basis for reversing his conviction. <i>Cf. United States v.

Ziskind was sentenced under Sentencing Guidelines in effect in November 1998 and before <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), rendered the Guidelines advisory. Ziskind's presentence report (PSR) recommended a base offense level of four, increased by thirteen levels for losses from relevant conduct beginning in 1995. The PSR also recommended a three-level enhancement based on Ziskind's leadership role in the conspiracy, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. 3B1.1(b), and a four-level enhancement for receiving stolen property while in that business, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2B1.1(b)(1)(B). Under the PSR calculation, Ziskind's guideline range was 63 to 78 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ziskind raised several objections to the PSR, including the calculation of the amount of loss, the role-in-the-offense enhancement, and the \"being in the business of receiving stolen property\" enhancement. The court reduced the loss calculation to provide for only a ten-level enhancement. In so doing, it counted losses from the two 1997 thefts and one theft that occurred in 1996. The court also rejected the challenge to the \"in the business\" enhancement and increased the role-in-the-offense enhancement to four levels based on the view that Ziskind was extensively involved in managing the conspiracy and that the conspiracy involved more than five participants. The resulting guideline sentencing range (GSR) was 51 to 63 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Ziskind to 63 months of imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. The court explained its sentencing rationale as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am going to impose the high end of the Guidelines. And, in fact, I gave very serious consideration to whether or not I should exceed them. But I have given fairly detailed consideration to evaluation of loss at the front end &#8212; that is, in the calculation of the relevant total offense level. And my concern was that I not enervate that kind of evaluation by a separate back-door evaluation of the scope of the offense. So, I have chosen not to depart here, although there is in this case a fairly substantial amount of evidence suggesting that the loss that I've calculated does not completely capture all of the defendant's activities. I have also considered the question of this stale criminal record and determined that it would be inappropriate for me to import the prior convictions that are outside of the range that the Guidelines take into consideration into my evaluation of whether or not to depart here. Again, those are close questions in this case, but not ones that have ultimately caused me to depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ziskind's first challenge to his sentence is to the district court's inclusion of the 1996 theft in its loss calculation on the ground that this conduct took place outside the five-year statute of limitations for the charged offenses. In making this argument, Ziskind relies on the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Stogner v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130161\"><a href=\"/opinion/130161/stogner-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130161\"><a href=\"/opinion/130161/stogner-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span> (2003), and <i>Booker.</i> We review this challenge to the guideline calculation de novo as it presents a question of law. <i>See United States v. Talladino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195724\"><a href=\"/opinion/195724/united-states-v-talladino/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span>, 1263 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Stogner</i> is irrelevant. In that case, the Court held that a California statute that restarted the limitations period for sex-related child abuse offenses to one year from the time that the crime was reported to police was unconstitutionally ex post facto. <i>Stogner</i> does not concern a court's ability to consider relevant conduct occurring outside the statute of limitations period for sentencing the defendant for a crime that took place within the statute of limitations period, and we have been shown no case suggesting its relevance. Moreover, consideration of conduct taking place outside the limitations period for sentencing purposes has been held not to be punishment and thus ex post facto concerns are inapposite. <i>See United States v.

Ziskind contends, however, that <i>Booker</i> undermines this rule because the jury did not find that he actually committed the conduct outside of the statute of limitations period which the court used to increase his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument misconstrues the holding in <i>Booker. Booker</i> did not hold that the Sixth Amendment prohibits judicial factfinding; it held only that the Sixth Amendment is violated by a mandatory guideline sentence scheme predicated on such factual determinations. <i>See United States v. De Los Santos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201781\"><a href=\"/opinion/201781/united-states-v-de-los-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir. 2005); <i>United States v.

Thus, we have consistently rejected the argument that judicial factfinding, by itself, violates <i>Booker. E.g., United States v. Bermudez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201598\"><a href=\"/opinion/201598/united-states-v-bermudez/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span>, 545 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v.

And consistent with this view, courts of appeals after <i>Booker</i> have continued to uphold the district court's reliance on relevant conduct outside of the limitations period in setting a sentence. <i>See United States v. Hamaker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77396\"><a href=\"/opinion/77396/united-states-v-dewey-m-hamaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1316</span></a></span>, 1336 (11th Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Greer,</i> 175 Fed.Appx. 95, 96 (7th Cir.2006). Accordingly, Ziskind's argument that the district court erred in considering relevant conduct outside the statute of limitations period in fashioning his sentence fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ziskind next challenges the district court's imposition of a four-level role-in-the-offense enhancement. He argues that this enhancement was inappropriately applied because his involvement in the conspiracy was limited to identifying \"what sort of stolen goods could be readily marketed.\" We review the imposition of a role-in-the-offense enhancement for clear error. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez Alvarado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599287\"><a href=\"/opinion/599287/united-states-v-jorge-l-rodriguez-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3B1.1(a) of the Guidelines prescribes offense-level enhancements based upon the size of the criminal organization and the defendant's role in the offense. A four-level enhancement applies where the defendant engages in a leadership or organizational role for criminal activity that involved five or more people. <i>Id.</i> The Guidelines provide a nonexclusive list of factors to guide the determination of whether a defendant held a leadership or organizational role.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record easily supports the district court's decision to apply the four-level enhancement. There was evidence that Ziskind conceived of the scheme; actively recruited participants; exercised control over the operation by deciding what goods to steal; and controlled the payout of money earned by the scheme to other participants. <i>See generally United States v. Monteiro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201747\"><a href=\"/opinion/201747/united-states-v-monteiro/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 212-13 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Ziskind argues that he is entitled to remand for resentencing under <i>Booker</i> because he was sentenced pursuant to the pre-<i>Booker</i> mandatory guideline regime. Ziskind concedes that he did not preserve this argument, and therefore review is limited to plain error. Under plain error review, a defendant sentenced pre-<i>Booker</i> is entitled to resentencing if he can demonstrate \"a reasonable probability that he would have received a more lenient sentence under an advisory guideline regime.\" <i>United States v. Martins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201656\"><a href=\"/opinion/201656/united-states-v-martins/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 154 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ziskind cannot make the necessary showing. The district court sentenced him at the high end of the applicable GSR, a fact that indicates a remote possibility of a below guideline sentence on remand. <i>See United States v. McLean,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790402\"><a href=\"/opinion/790402/united-states-v-dale-mclean-united-states-of-america-v-manolin-feliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 505 (1st Cir.2005). Moreover, at sentencing, the district court stated that it \"gave very serious consideration\" to imposing a sentence above the GSR. Addressing Ziskind's motion to stay the execution of sentence, the district court also explicitly stated that \"the sentence imposed under the mandatory guidelines scheme would in all likelihood be the sentence [it] would impose under an advisory guidelines sentencing scheme.\" On this record, there is no basis to conclude that Ziskind would be sentenced more leniently on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Ziskind contends that the district court erred in sentencing him to 63 months' imprisonment on the conspiracy count because that sentence exceeded the 60-month statutory maximum. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371. The government concedes this error, and we therefore vacate the sentence on the conspiracy count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we <i>vacate</i> the sentence on the conspiracy count (Count 1) and <i>remand</i> for the imposition of a 60-month sentence on this count. The remainder of the judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We recently rejected another appeal from Ziskind in a criminal prosecution involving a different theft conspiracy<i>See United States v.
