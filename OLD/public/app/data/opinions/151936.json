David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.            In 2008, plaintiffs Amelia Peters\n\nBingham and her son, Steven, brought a Takings Clause claim against\n\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Town of Mashpee, seeking\n\njust   compensation       and     the     return       of    some      of    the     lands   in\n\nMassachusetts      they     say    were    granted          in    perpetuity         to   their\n\nancestors, the South Sea Indians, in deeds from 1665 and 1667.\n\n            Plaintiffs styled this claim as a class action on behalf\n\nof themselves and all similarly situated descendants of the South\n\nSea Indians, now known as the Mashpee Wampanoag.                                   The Mashpee\n\nWampanoag have been a federally recognized tribe since 2007.                                 72\n\nFed. Reg. 8007-01 (Feb. 22, 2007).                   Plaintiffs do not claim that\n\nthe Commonwealth or Town directly seized lands from their tribal\n\nancestors.        Rather,       plaintiffs       argue      that       two    Massachusetts\n\nstatutes enacted in 1869 and 1870 deprived them of their right to\n\nhold in perpetuity all of the land currently comprising the Town of\n\nMashpee    by   removing        restraints      on     alienation           and,    later,   by\n\nfacilitating the sale of certain lands.\n\n            The    district       court    held      that        the   plaintiffs         lacked\n\nstanding and dismissed their claims against the Commonwealth and\n\nTown, Bingham v. Massachusetts (Bingham I), No. 08-11770, 2009 WL\n\n1259963,   at     *1-2    (D.     Mass.   May     6,    2009),         and   affirmed      that\n\ndismissal on plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, Bingham v.\n\nMassachusetts (Bingham II), No. 08-11770, 2009 WL 1886128, at *2\n\n(D. Mass. July 2, 2009).            Plaintiffs appeal only the dismissal of\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\ftheir claims against the Commonwealth.              The Commonwealth asserts\n\nthat the Eleventh Amendment bars this suit from being brought\n\nagainst it in federal court and that plaintiffs, in any event, lack\n\nstanding.\n\n             We affirm and hold that there is no jurisdiction to hear\n\nthis case, because even when viewing all factual allegations in\n\nplaintiffs' favor, plaintiffs cannot show they have suffered a\n\npersonal injury as a result of the challenged state actions.                  We do\n\nnot reach the Eleventh Amendment issues, nor do we reach any\n\nstatute-of-limitations issues.\n\n                                         I.\n\n             We accept as true the following allegations of fact, as\n\nstated in plaintiffs' complaint and in supporting documentation,\n\nand construe them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.                   See\n\nSanchez v. Pereira-Castillo, 590 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir. 2009); Alt.\n\nEnergy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 267 F.3d 30, 33-34\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n             Deeds   in   1665     and   1667   granted    the   subject   land--\n\nsubstantial portions of the land that currently comprise the Town\n\nof Mashpee--to \"the South Sea Indians: and their[] Children for\n\never: and not to be sold or given away from them by any one:\n\nwithout all their[] Consents there unto.\"                 In 1685, the General\n\nCourt   of   Plymouth     Colony    \"confirme[d]    said    land   to   the   said\n\nIndians, to be perpetually to them & their children, as that no\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fpart of them shall be granted to or purchased by any English [non-\n\ntribal member] whatsoe[v]er . . . without the consent of all the\n\nsaid Indians.\"       See Mashpee Tribe v. Town of Mashpee (Mashpee I),\n\n447 F. Supp. 940, 944 & n.2 (D. Mass. 1978), aff'd sub nom. Mashpee\n\nTribe    v.   New    Seabury   Corp.,     592   F.2d   575   (1st   Cir.    1979)\n\n(interpreting the word \"English\" in the 1685 grant to include any\n\nnon-Indians).1\n\n              Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that these deeds conveyed\n\nindividual, inheritable rights in the subject lands to the grantees\n\nand that these interests passed to plaintiffs as the direct lineal\n\ndescendants     of   the   South   Sea    Indians.2     In   support   of    this\n\ncontention, plaintiffs listed their predecessors going back five\n\n\n     1\n          Our review of a motion to dismiss on grounds of standing\nis ordinarily confined to the complaint and to \"further\nparticularized allegations of fact deemed supportive of plaintiff's\nstanding.\" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501 (1975). However,\nthe text of the deeds and earlier judicial opinions addressing\nprior, related claims to the land in the Town fall under a narrow\nexception, which allows courts to additionally consider \"official\npublic records\" and \"documents sufficiently referred to in the\ncomplaint,\" among other materials. Alt. Energy, Inc., 267 F.3d at\n33-34.\n     2\n          Because plaintiffs claim property rights based on formal\ndeeds they say the Pilgrims granted, we understand plaintiffs'\nclaim as not relying on the theory of aboriginal title. See N.\nNewton et al., Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law § 15.04[2],\nat 969-70 & 969 n.28 (2005 ed.) (describing different ways in which\nIndian tribes and individual Indians have obtained interests in\nreal property).   Aboriginal title (also called \"original Indian\ntitle\") derives from the tribe's continuous possession of lands and\nis a \"right of occupancy in the Indian tribes . . . good against\nall but the sovereign,\" Oneida Indian Nation v. Cnty. of Oneida,\n414 U.S. 661, 667 (1974), as distinguishable from fee title, see\nJames v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fgenerations.    The complaint did not specify birth or death dates,\n\ndetails about residency, or their predecessors' relationship to the\n\nSouth Sea Indians.       It explained that \"[a]s a general rule,\"\n\nrecords prior to the nineteenth century \"were not maintained for\n\nIndians.\"\n\n            Between 1685 and 1834, Plymouth Colony, and later the\n\nCommonwealth, continually recognized the restraints on alienation\n\ncontained in the original deeds as the subject land evolved from an\n\nIndian plantation to the \"Mashpee Propriety.\"           In 1834, parts of\n\nthe   subject   land   became   the   \"District   of   Mashpee,\"   but   the\n\nrestraints on alienation in the original deeds endured.\n\n            In 1842, the Massachusetts General Court passed a law\n\nproviding that much of the lands in the district would now be held\n\nin severalty by proprietors, who included Indians who had occupied\n\nand improved the land.3         See Mashpee I, 447 F. Supp. at 945\n\n(describing proprietors).       Proprietors were allotted acreage from\n\nthe common lands, in addition to any lands they already held in\n\nseveralty, so that each proprietor held at least sixty acres.            Id.\n\nThe remainder of the subject land--some three thousand acres--was\n\nstill held in common by the selectmen of the district, who were all\n\nIndians.     Id. at 945-46.       The 1842 law again confirmed the\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          We use the term \"Indians,\" as opposed to \"Native\nAmericans,\" for the sake of consistency with the language of the\noriginal deeds and relevant statutes.\n\n                                      -5-\n\frestraints on alienation from the seventeenth-century deeds.   Id.\n\nat 945.\n\n          In 1869, however, the Massachusetts General Court enacted\n\na statute providing, in relevant part, that\n\n          [a]ll lands heretofore known as Indian lands,\n          and   rightfully  held   by  any   Indian  in\n          severalty, and all such lands which have been\n          or may be set off to any Indian, shall be and\n          become the property of such person and his\n          heirs in fee simple . . . and all Indians\n          shall hereafter have the same rights as other\n          citizens to take, hold, convey and transmit\n          real estate.\n\n1869 Mass. Acts ch. 463, § 2.4   The law removed restraints on the\n\nalienation of the subject land, and plaintiffs allege this was over\n\nthe objections of a majority of South Sea Indian descendants who\n\nattended a hearing on the legislation.5\n\n          A year later, in 1870, the Massachusetts General Court\n\npassed a law creating and incorporating the Town of Mashpee.   The\n\n\n\n     4\n          The 1869 act, entitled \"An Act to Enfranchise the Indians\nof the Commonwealth,\" was a general recognition statute that also\nconferred full citizenship on \"[a]ll Indians . . . within this\nCommonwealth.\" Section 1 of the law declared all Indians \"to be\ncitizens of the Commonwealth, and entitled to all the rights,\nprivileges and immunities, and subject to all the duties and\nliabilities to which citizens of this Commonwealth are entitled or\nsubject.\" 1869 Mass. Acts ch. 463, § 1.\n     5\n          The 1869 act permitted but did not require any Indian to\nalienate his lands.    1869 Mass. Acts ch. 463, § 2.     Some have\nviewed the act as beneficial to the Indians because it added to the\nbundle of property rights the same rights of alienation as others\nheld. See, e.g., James, 716 F.2d at 75. Plaintiffs' complaint\nsimply alleges the act was a source of unidentified harm to their\nancestors' property rights.\n\n                                 -6-\n\flaw provided that \"[a]ll common lands . . . held by the district of\n\nMarshpee, are hereby transferred to the town of Mashpee, and shall\n\nbe owned and enjoyed as like property and rights of other towns are\n\nowned and enjoyed.\"       1870 Mass. Acts ch. 293, § 1.      Another\n\nprovision of the 1870 law stated that upon application of the\n\nTown's selectmen, a superior court justice could, after notice to\n\nall interested parties and a hearing, determine that \"it is for the\n\ninterest of said parties that any or all of the common lands of\n\nsaid town, or of the people heretofore known as the Marshpee tribe\n\nof Indians, be divided.\"    Id. § 6.   The justice could then appoint\n\nthree \"discreet, disinterested persons [as] commissioners to make\n\npartition of the same.\"    Id.\n\n          The gravamen of plaintiffs' complaint is that the 1869\n\nand 1870 statutes \"took ownership interests in the subject land\n\nthat belonged to the plaintiffs without paying just compensation,\"6\n\nin violation of the Takings Clause.     They allege that the removal\n\nof restraints on the alienation of Indian lands in the 1869 act\n\n\n\n     6\n          Plaintiffs did not assert claims under any other specific\nconstitutional provisions or statutes applicable to Indian tribes,\nsuch as the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3,\nor the Indian Nonintercourse Act (INA), 25 U.S.C. § 177.\nPlaintiffs have also consistently portrayed the instruments at\nissue as deeds, not treaties.\n     Plaintiffs' complaint cursorily asserted that the Town and\nCommonwealth had \"violated the plaintiffs' rights pursuant to\nfederal common law and federal Indian policies through their\nongoing claim, holding, and/or use and occupancy of portions of the\nsubject land.\"   That language is too vague to state a claim on\nthese grounds under any standard.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdeprived   plaintiffs      of    their    \"perpetual        interest     in    .     .    .\n\nownership.\"       \"[T]hrough\" the 1870 act creating the Town, the\n\nCommonwealth also \"transferred the common land of substantial\n\nportions   of     the    subject    land\"       to    the     Town,    which         sold\n\n\"[a]pproximately three thousand acres of the subject land\" at an\n\nunspecified later date.           \"Between 1870 and the present date,\"\n\nplaintiffs conclude, most of the subject land promised to the tribe\n\nin perpetuity has been conveyed to non tribal members without the\n\nconsent of all tribal descendants.\n\n           Plaintiffs seek the return of \"every portion of the\n\nsubject land which is claimed, held, occupied, and/or used\" by\n\ndefendants,      \"with   the    exception      of    any    substantial       building\n\nstructures and any other structures of improvements that serve a\n\ncritical role in state or town operations.\"                  They also seek fees\n\nfor the use of land so held or used and just compensation \"for the\n\nownership interests in the subject land that were taken from the\n\nplaintiffs in 186[9] and 1870.\"             They do not seek the return of\n\nland held by private parties.\n\n           On May 6, 2009, after a hearing on the Commonwealth and\n\nTown's separate motions to dismiss, the district court granted the\n\nmotions    and    dismissed      plaintiffs'         complaint     for        lack       of\n\njurisdiction.      See Bingham I, 2009 WL 1259963, at *1-2.                    It held\n\nthat plaintiffs lacked standing to sue irrespective of whether the\n\ndeeds conveyed lands to the South Sea Indians as a tribe or to\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\findividual members.     Id. at *1.     Plaintiffs did not represent the\n\ntribe and thus could not sue on the tribe's behalf.           Id. at *1-2.\n\nEven if the deed conveyed rights to individual tribal members,\n\nplaintiffs failed to identify individual ancestors who had actually\n\ninherited property under the deeds or to otherwise trace their\n\ninterest through successive generations.         Id. at *1.\n\n            On July 2, 2009, the district court denied plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for reconsideration.         See Bingham II, 2009 WL 1886128, at\n\n*2.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            We review the district court's dismissal for lack of\n\nstanding de novo. Though we construe the facts and draw reasonable\n\ninferences in plaintiffs' favor, plaintiffs bear the burden of\n\n\"clearly alleging definite facts to demonstrate that jurisdiction\n\nis proper.\"     Nulankeyutmonen Nkihtaqmikon v. Impson, 503 F.3d 18,\n\n25 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            To establish standing under Article III of the U.S.\n\nConstitution,    plaintiffs    \"must    allege   personal   injury    fairly\n\ntraceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely\n\nto be redressed by the requested relief.\"           Hein v. Freedom from\n\nReligion Found., Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 598 (2007) (quoting Allen v.\n\nWright,   468   U.S.   737,   751   (1984))   (internal   quotation    marks\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f          The district court correctly held that plaintiffs lack\n\nstanding because they failed to show a personal injury. Plaintiffs\n\nmust show they had an individual interest in the property rights\n\ngranted in the seventeenth-century deeds in order to show they were\n\npersonally injured by the later state actions affecting those\n\nproperty rights.   Plaintiffs can do so only if the deeds conveyed\n\nto plaintiffs' individual ancestors discrete property interests\n\nthat passed through successive generations.   Even when viewing all\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, and taking all\n\nreasonable inferences in their favor, plaintiffs have not alleged\n\nsufficient facts to surmount this bar.\n\n          The relevant language in the 1665 deed conveyed the\n\nsubject lands to \"the South Sea Indians: and their[] Children for\n\never: and not to be sold or given away from them by any one:\n\nwithout all their[] Consents there unto.\" The 1685 grant contained\n\nsimilar material language.   In plaintiffs' favor, we will assume,\n\nas the district court did, that the reference to the \"South Sea\n\nIndians . . . and their[] children\" is ambiguous.7\n\n\n     7\n          We bypass the Commonwealth's arguments that our\nprecedents involving these instruments conclusively interpreted\nthis language. The Commonwealth cites Mashpee I, 447 F. Supp. 940,\nand Mashpee Tribe v. Watt (Mashpee II), 542 F. Supp. 797 (D. Mass.\n1982), aff'd, 707 F.2d 23 (1st Cir. 1983), in support of its\ncontention.   In neither case was the district court faced with\nconstruing the 1665 deed. And those arguments were not at issue in\nthe appeals to this circuit, which affirmed on other grounds not\nrelevant to the issue of land status.\n     Indeed, those earlier cases concerning the Mashpee Tribe's\nclaims to the subject lands at issue here concerned different\n\n                               -10-\n\f           Plaintiffs insist the deed and grant did not convey the\n\nlands to the collective members of the tribe in common.   Under that\n\ninterpretation, the ownership of the land would belong to the tribe\n\nas a whole, and no individual member would have a personal interest\n\nin a particular share of the property.     See N. Newton et. al.,\n\nCohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law § 16.01[2], at 1037 (2005\n\ned).   Only the tribe would have standing to sue for any injury to\n\nits interests under the deed.    Plaintiffs argue the deed must be\n\nread as conveying individual interests in the land to individual\n\ntribal members.\n\n           We need not determine whether the conveyances were to\n\nindividual tribal members or to the collective tribe, because\n\nplaintiffs lack standing under either interpretation.     Plaintiffs\n\ndo not represent the tribe, nor do they claim the capacity to do\n\nso.    Plaintiffs cannot assert the rights of the tribe, as an\n\n\n\n\nissues entirely. Mashpee I primarily discussed claims under the\nINA asserted by the \"Mashpee Tribe\" as a collective tribe.\nPlaintiffs' primary theory was that the 1869 and 1870 acts lifted\nrestraints on alienation in violation of the INA, which permits\nonly the federal government to do so. See New Seabury Corp., 592\nF.2d at 579; Mashpee I, 447 F. Supp. at 942-43.         Mashpee II\ninvolved claims under the INA, Indian Commerce Clause, and\nSupremacy Clause by individual tribal members as well as the tribe.\nThe district court held, and this circuit affirmed, that only the\ntribe had standing to bring such claims and that Mashpee I had\nconclusively established that the Mashpee Tribe was not recognized\nas a tribe under federal law. 707 F.2d at 24-25; 542 F. Supp. at\n800-06.   We do not decide what effect the Department of the\nInterior's 2007 designation of the Mashpee Wampanoag as a federally\nrecognized tribe has on those opinions.\n\n                                -11-\n\fentity, simply by styling their claim as a class action on behalf\n\nof all tribal descendants.8\n\n            Even assuming arguendo that the deed conveyed discrete\n\nproperty rights to the tribe's individual members, plaintiffs still\n\ncannot show a personal injury.         Plaintiffs have alleged they are\n\ndirect descendants of South Sea Indian grantees who were the\n\noriginal beneficiaries of the deeds. Plaintiffs have not, however,\n\nalleged any facts showing that their ancestors actually held an\n\nindividual, inheritable interest in the subject land that passed\n\nthrough successive generations.         And they have not alleged any\n\nfacts    showing   their   ancestors    actually   held   individual   and\n\ninheritable interests in the subject land as of 1869-70.\n\n            Plaintiffs have also failed to allege that any such\n\ninterests were affected as a result of the 1869 and 1870 acts in\n\nways that resulted in the transfer or loss of ownership of those\n\nlands.

The Mashpee Wampanoag have been a federally recognized tribe since 2007. 72 Fed.Reg. 8007-01 (Feb. 22, 2007). Plaintiffs do not claim that the Commonwealth or Town directly seized lands from their tribal ancestors. Rather, plaintiffs argue that two Massachusetts statutes enacted in 1869 and 1870 deprived them of their right to hold in perpetuity all of the land currently comprising the Town of Mashpee by removing restraints on alienation and, later, by facilitating the sale of certain lands.</p>\n<p>The district court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing and dismissed their claims against the Commonwealth and Town, <i>Bingham v. Massachusetts</i> (<i>Bingham I</i>), No. 08-11770, 2009 WL 1259963, at *1-2 (D.Mass. May 6, 2009), and affirmed that dismissal on plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, <i>Bingham v. Massachusetts</i> (<i>Bingham II</i>), No. 08-11770, 2009 WL 1886128, at *2 (D.Mass. July 2, 2009). Plaintiffs appeal only the dismissal of their claims against the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth asserts that the Eleventh Amendment bars this suit from being brought against it in federal court and that plaintiffs, in any event, lack standing.</p>\n<p>We affirm and hold that there is no jurisdiction to hear this case, because even when viewing all factual allegations in plaintiffs' favor, plaintiffs cannot show they have suffered a personal injury as a result of the challenged state actions. We do not reach the Eleventh Amendment issues, nor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> do we reach any statute-of-limitations issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We accept as true the following allegations of fact, as stated in plaintiffs' complaint and in supporting documentation, and construe them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez v. Pereira-Castillo,</i> 590 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Alt. Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 267 F.3d 30, 33-34 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p>Deeds in 1665 and 1667 granted the subject landsubstantial portions of the land that currently comprise the Town of Mashpeeto \"the South Sea Indians: and their[] Children for ever: and not to be sold or given away from them by any one: without all their[] Consents there unto.\" In 1685, the General Court of Plymouth Colony \"confirme[d] said land to the said Indians, to be perpetually to them &amp; their children, as that no part of them shall be granted to or purchased by any English [non-tribal member] whatsoe[v]er . . . without the consent of all the said Indians.\" <i>See </i><i>Mashpee Tribe v. Town of Mashpee</i> (<i>Mashpee I</i>), 447 F.Supp. 940, 944 &amp; n. 2 (D.Mass.1978), <i>aff'd sub nom. </i><i>Mashpee Tribe v. New Seabury Corp.,</i> 592 F.2d 575 (1st Cir.1979) (interpreting the word \"English\" in the 1685 grant to include any non-Indians).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that these deeds conveyed individual, inheritable rights in the subject lands to the grantees and that these interests passed to plaintiffs as the direct lineal descendants of the South Sea Indians.<sup>[2]</sup> In support of this contention, plaintiffs listed their predecessors going back five generations. The complaint did not specify birth or death dates, details about residency, or their predecessors' relationship to the South Sea Indians. It explained that \"[a]s a general rule,\" records prior to the nineteenth century \"were not maintained for Indians.\"</p>\n<p>Between 1685 and 1834, Plymouth Colony, and later the Commonwealth, continually recognized the restraints on alienation contained in the original deeds as the subject land evolved from an Indian plantation to the \"Mashpee Propriety.\" In 1834, parts of the subject land became the \"District of Mashpee,\" but the restraints on alienation in the original deeds endured.</p>\n<p>In 1842, the Massachusetts General Court passed a law providing that much of the lands in the district would now be held in severalty by proprietors, who included <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> Indians who had occupied and improved the land.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Mashpee I,</i> 447 F.Supp. at 945 (describing proprietors). Proprietors were allotted acreage from the common lands, in addition to any lands they already held in severalty, so that each proprietor held at least sixty acres. <i>Id.</i> The remainder of the subject landsome three thousand acreswas still held in common by the selectmen of the district, who were all Indians. <i>Id.</i> at 945-46. The 1842 law again confirmed the restraints on alienation from the seventeenth-century deeds. <i>Id.</i> at 945.</p>\n<p>In 1869, however, the Massachusetts General Court enacted a statute providing, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote>[a]ll lands heretofore known as Indian lands, and rightfully held by any Indian in severalty, and all such lands which have been or may be set off to any Indian, shall be and become the property of such person and his heirs in fee simple . . . and all Indians shall hereafter have the same rights as other citizens to take, hold, convey and transmit real estate.</blockquote>\n<p>1869 Mass. Acts ch. 463, § 2.<sup>[4]</sup> The law removed restraints on the alienation of the subject land, and plaintiffs allege this was over the objections of a majority of South Sea Indian descendants who attended a hearing on the legislation.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>A year later, in 1870, the Massachusetts General Court passed a law creating and incorporating the Town of Mashpee. The law provided that \"[a]ll common lands . . . held by the district of Marshpee, are hereby transferred to the town of Mashpee, and shall be owned and enjoyed as like property and rights of other towns are owned and enjoyed.\" 1870 Mass. Acts ch. 293, § 1. Another provision of the 1870 law stated that upon application of the Town's selectmen, a superior court justice could, after notice to all interested parties and a hearing, determine that \"it is for the interest of said parties that any or all of the common lands of said town, or of the people heretofore known as the Marshpee tribe of Indians, be divided.\" <i>Id.</i> § 6. The justice could then appoint three \"discreet, disinterested persons [as] commissioners to make partition of the same.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The gravamen of plaintiffs' complaint is that the 1869 and 1870 statutes \"took ownership interests in the subject land that belonged to the plaintiffs without paying just compensation,\"<sup>[6]</sup> in violation of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Takings Clause. They allege that the removal of restraints on the alienation of Indian lands in the 1869 act deprived plaintiffs of their \"perpetual interest in . . . ownership.\" \"[T]hrough\" the 1870 act creating the Town, the Commonwealth also \"transferred the common land of substantial portions of the subject land\" to the Town, which sold \"[a]pproximately three thousand acres of the subject land\" at an unspecified later date. \"Between 1870 and the present date,\" plaintiffs conclude, most of the subject land promised to the tribe in perpetuity has been conveyed to non tribal members without the consent of all tribal descendants.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs seek the return of \"every portion of the subject land which is claimed, held, occupied, and/or used\" by defendants, \"with the exception of any substantial building structures and any other structures of improvements that serve a critical role in state or town operations.\" They also seek fees for the use of land so held or used and just compensation \"for the ownership interests in the subject land that were taken from the plaintiffs in 186[9] and 1870.\" They do not seek the return of land held by private parties.</p>\n<p>On May 6, 2009, after a hearing on the Commonwealth and Town's separate motions to dismiss, the district court granted the motions and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <i>See Bingham I,</i> 2009 WL 1259963, at *1-2. It held that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue irrespective of whether the deeds conveyed lands to the South Sea Indians as a tribe or to individual members. <i>Id.</i> at *1. Plaintiffs did not represent the tribe and thus could not sue on the tribe's behalf. <i>Id.</i> at *1-2. Even if the deed conveyed rights to individual tribal members, plaintiffs failed to identify individual ancestors who had actually inherited property under the deeds or to otherwise trace their interest through successive generations. <i>Id.</i> at *1.</p>\n<p>On July 2, 2009, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. <i>See Bingham II,</i> 2009 WL 1886128, at *2.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's dismissal for lack of standing de novo. Though we construe the facts and draw reasonable inferences in plaintiffs' favor, plaintiffs bear the burden of \"clearly alleging definite facts to demonstrate that jurisdiction is proper.\" <i>Nulankeyutmonen Nkihtaqmikon v. Impson,</i> 503 F.3d 18, 25 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>To establish standing under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, plaintiffs \"must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" <i>Hein v. Freedom from Religion Found., Inc.,</i> 551 U.S. 587, 598, 127 S.Ct. 2553, 168 L.Ed.2d 424 (2007) (quoting <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The district court correctly held that plaintiffs lack standing because they failed to show a <i>personal</i> injury. Plaintiffs must show they had an individual interest in the property rights granted in the seventeenth-century deeds in order to show they were personally injured by the later state actions affecting those property rights. Plaintiffs can do so only if the deeds conveyed to plaintiffs' individual ancestors discrete property interests that passed through successive generations. Even when viewing all facts in the light <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> most favorable to plaintiffs, and taking all reasonable inferences in their favor, plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to surmount this bar.</p>\n<p>The relevant language in the 1665 deed conveyed the subject lands to \"the South Sea Indians: and their[] Children for ever: and not to be sold or given away from them by any one: without all their[] Consents there unto.\" The 1685 grant contained similar material language. In plaintiffs' favor, we will assume, as the district court did, that the reference to the \"South Sea Indians . . . and their[] children\" is ambiguous.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs insist the deed and grant did not convey the lands to the collective members of the tribe in common. Under that interpretation, the ownership of the land would belong to the tribe as a whole, and no individual member would have a personal interest in a particular share of the property. <i>See</i> N. Newton et. al., <i>Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law</i> § 16.01[2], at 1037 (2005 ed.). Only the tribe would have standing to sue for any injury to its interests under the deed. Plaintiffs argue the deed must be read as conveying individual interests in the land to individual tribal members.</p>\n<p>We need not determine whether the conveyances were to individual tribal members or to the collective tribe, because plaintiffs lack standing under either interpretation. Plaintiffs do not represent the tribe, nor do they claim the capacity to do so. Plaintiffs cannot assert the rights of the tribe, as an entity, simply by styling their claim as a class action on behalf of all tribal descendants.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Even assuming arguendo that the deed conveyed discrete property rights to the tribe's individual members, plaintiffs still cannot show a personal injury. Plaintiffs have alleged they are direct descendants of South Sea Indian grantees who were the original beneficiaries of the deeds. Plaintiffs have not, however, alleged any facts showing that their ancestors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> actually held an individual, inheritable interest in the subject land that passed through successive generations. And they have not alleged any facts showing their ancestors actually held individual and inheritable interests in the subject land as of 1869-70.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have also failed to allege that any such interests were affected as a result of the 1869 and 1870 acts in ways that resulted in the transfer or loss of ownership of those lands. Nor have they pled any facts showing that the loss of any \"right\" to hold the lands in perpetuity has caused them any injury. Plaintiffs say that \"[t]hrough\" the 1870 act, between 1870 and the present, many of the subject lands were ultimately conveyed to non-Indians, but a vague allegation of harms occurring over an undefined, 140-year time period is not the kind of concrete, particularized injury required to show standing. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist.,</i> 584 F.3d 314, 325-26 (1st Cir.2009). These shortcomings are fatal to plaintiffs' ability to show that they had an identifiable personal stake in the property rights at issue and that they suffered a concrete injury fairly traceable to the Commonwealth's allegedly unlawful conduct. This holding, of lack of pleading of individual harm from the 1869-1870 acts, also disposes of their procedural due process claim, which fails for futility.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the district court erred when it dismissed their complaint sua sponte on the ground that the Binghams failed to allege sufficient genealogical data to support individual interest standing and they could not assert standing on behalf of the tribe. The Town's motion to dismiss had argued only that the tribe, not individual tribal members, had standing to sue for injuries to property interests granted in the seventeenth-century deeds. The Town did not address, until its reply brief to the motion for reconsideration, the issue of lack of individual interest standing.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' motion to reconsider and to amend their complaint to add the names of ancestors going back to the 1665 and 1667 deeds, dates of birth and death for previous generations, and the names of ancestors who were grantees under the deeds would, as we have held, not have changed the outcome. In light of that futility, there was no error in denial of reconsideration and the motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p>The judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Our review of a motion to dismiss on grounds of standing is ordinarily confined to the complaint and to \"further particularized allegations of fact deemed supportive of plaintiff's standing.\" <i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). However, the text of the deeds and earlier judicial opinions addressing prior, related claims to the land in the Town fall under a narrow exception, which allows courts to additionally consider \"official public records\" and \"documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint,\" among other materials. <i>Alt. Energy, Inc.,</i> 267 F.3d at 33-34.</p>\n<p>[2]  Because plaintiffs claim property rights based on formal deeds they say the Pilgrims granted, we understand plaintiffs' claim as not relying on the theory of aboriginal title. <i>See</i> N. Newton et al., <i>Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law</i> § 15.04[2], at 969-70 &amp; 969 n.28 (2005 ed.) (describing different ways in which Indian tribes and individual Indians have obtained interests in real property). Aboriginal title (also called \"original Indian title\") derives from the tribe's continuous possession of lands and is a \"right of occupancy in the Indian tribes . . . good against all but the sovereign,\" <i>Oneida Indian Nation v. Cnty. of Oneida,</i> 414 U.S. 661, 667, 94 S.Ct. 772, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974), as distinguishable from fee title, <i>see </i><i>James v. Watt,</i> 716 F.2d 71, 74 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n<p>[3]  We use the term \"Indians,\" as opposed to \"Native Americans,\" for the sake of consistency with the language of the original deeds and relevant statutes.</p>\n<p>[4]  The 1869 act, entitled \"An Act to Enfranchise the Indians of the Commonwealth,\" was a general recognition statute that also conferred full citizenship on \"[a]ll Indians . . . within this Commonwealth.\" Section 1 of the law declared all Indians \"to be citizens of the Commonwealth, and entitled to all the rights, privileges and immunities, and subject to all the duties and liabilities to which citizens of this Commonwealth are entitled or subject.\" 1869 Mass. Acts ch. 463, § 1.</p>\n<p>[5]  The 1869 act permitted but did not require any Indian to alienate his lands. 1869 Mass. Acts ch. 463, § 2. Some have viewed the act as beneficial to the Indians because it added to the bundle of property rights the same rights of alienation as others held. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>James,</i> 716 F.2d at 75. Plaintiffs' complaint simply alleges the act was a source of unidentified harm to their ancestors' property rights.</p>\n<p>[6]  Plaintiffs did not assert claims under any other specific constitutional provisions or statutes applicable to Indian tribes, such as the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, or the Indian Nonintercourse Act (INA), 25 U.S.C. § 177. Plaintiffs have also consistently portrayed the instruments at issue as deeds, not treaties.\n</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' complaint cursorily asserted that the Town and Commonwealth had \"violated the plaintiffs' rights pursuant to federal common law and federal Indian policies through their ongoing claim, holding, and/or use and occupancy of portions of the subject land.\" That language is too vague to state a claim on these grounds under any standard.</p>\n<p>[7]  We bypass the Commonwealth's arguments that our precedents involving these instruments conclusively interpreted this language. The Commonwealth cites <i>Mashpee I,</i> 447 F.Supp. 940, and <i>Mashpee Tribe v. Watt</i> (<i>Mashpee II</i>), 542 F.Supp. 797 (D.Mass. 1982), <i>aff'd,</i> 707 F.2d 23 (1st Cir.1983), in support of its contention. In neither case was the district court faced with construing the 1665 deed. And those arguments were not at issue in the appeals to this circuit, which affirmed on other grounds not relevant to the issue of land status.\n</p>\n<p>Indeed, those earlier cases concerning the Mashpee Tribe's claims to the subject lands at issue here concerned different issues entirely. <i>Mashpee I</i> primarily discussed claims under the INA asserted by the \"Mashpee Tribe\" as a collective tribe. Plaintiffs' primary theory was that the 1869 and 1870 acts lifted restraints on alienation in violation of the INA, which permits only the federal government to do so. <i>See </i><i>New Seabury Corp.,</i> 592 F.2d at 579; <i>Mashpee I,</i> 447 F.Supp. at 942-43. <i>Mashpee II</i> involved claims under the INA, Indian Commerce Clause, and Supremacy Clause by individual tribal members as well as the tribe. The district court held, and this circuit affirmed, that only the tribe had standing to bring such claims and that <i>Mashpee I</i> had conclusively established that the Mashpee Tribe was not recognized as a tribe under federal law. 707 F.2d at 24-25, 542 F.Supp. at 800-06. We do not decide what effect the Department of the Interior's 2007 designation of the Mashpee Wampanoag as a federally recognized tribe has on those opinions.</p>\n<p>[8]  Indeed, the tribe and its authorized representatives have repeatedly and strenuously disavowed plaintiffs' suit. In April 2008, the tribe entered into an agreement with the Town in which it received certain Town lands in exchange for waiving all claims to property located within the Town. On November 5, 2008, the tribe further distanced itself from plaintiffs' suit, formally resolving at a tribal council meeting that \"the Tribal Counsel condemns the land claim action brought by Steven Bingham and Amelia Bingham.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

The complaint did not specify birth or death dates, details about residency, or their predecessors' relationship to the South Sea Indians. It explained that \"[a]s a general rule,\" records prior to the nineteenth century \"were not maintained for Indians.\"</p>\n<p>Between 1685 and 1834, Plymouth Colony, and later the Commonwealth, continually recognized the restraints on alienation contained in the original deeds as the subject land evolved from an Indian plantation to the \"Mashpee Propriety.\" In 1834, parts of the subject land became the \"District of Mashpee,\" but the restraints on alienation in the original deeds endured.</p>\n<p>In 1842, the Massachusetts General Court passed a law providing that much of the lands in the district would now be held in severalty by proprietors, who included <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> Indians who had occupied and improved the land.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Mashpee I,</i> 447 F.Supp. at 945 (describing proprietors). Proprietors were allotted acreage from the common lands, in addition to any lands they already held in severalty, so that each proprietor held at least sixty acres. <i>Id.</i> The remainder of the subject landsome three thousand acreswas still held in common by the selectmen of the district, who were all Indians. <i>Id.</i> at 945-46. The 1842 law again confirmed the restraints on alienation from the seventeenth-century deeds. <i>Id.</i> at 945.</p>\n<p>In 1869, however, the Massachusetts General Court enacted a statute providing, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote>[a]ll lands heretofore known as Indian lands, and rightfully held by any Indian in severalty, and all such lands which have been or may be set off to any Indian, shall be and become the property of such person and his heirs in fee simple . . . and all Indians shall hereafter have the same rights as other citizens to take, hold, convey and transmit real estate.</blockquote>\n<p>1869 Mass. Acts ch. 463, § 2.<sup>[4]</sup> The law removed restraints on the alienation of the subject land, and plaintiffs allege this was over the objections of a majority of South Sea Indian descendants who attended a hearing on the legislation.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>A year later, in 1870, the Massachusetts General Court passed a law creating and incorporating the Town of Mashpee. The law provided that \"[a]ll common lands . . . held by the district of Marshpee, are hereby transferred to the town of Mashpee, and shall be owned and enjoyed as like property and rights of other towns are owned and enjoyed.\" 1870 Mass. Acts ch. 293, § 1. Another provision of the 1870 law stated that upon application of the Town's selectmen, a superior court justice could, after notice to all interested parties and a hearing, determine that \"it is for the interest of said parties that any or all of the common lands of said town, or of the people heretofore known as the Marshpee tribe of Indians, be divided.\" <i>Id.</i> § 6. The justice could then appoint three \"discreet, disinterested persons [as] commissioners to make partition of the same.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The gravamen of plaintiffs' complaint is that the 1869 and 1870 statutes \"took ownership interests in the subject land that belonged to the plaintiffs without paying just compensation,\"<sup>[6]</sup> in violation of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Takings Clause. They allege that the removal of restraints on the alienation of Indian lands in the 1869 act deprived plaintiffs of their \"perpetual interest in . . . ownership.\" \"[T]hrough\" the 1870 act creating the Town, the Commonwealth also \"transferred the common land of substantial portions of the subject land\" to the Town, which sold \"[a]pproximately three thousand acres of the subject land\" at an unspecified later date. \"Between 1870 and the present date,\" plaintiffs conclude, most of the subject land promised to the tribe in perpetuity has been conveyed to non tribal members without the consent of all tribal descendants.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs seek the return of \"every portion of the subject land which is claimed, held, occupied, and/or used\" by defendants, \"with the exception of any substantial building structures and any other structures of improvements that serve a critical role in state or town operations.\" They also seek fees for the use of land so held or used and just compensation \"for the ownership interests in the subject land that were taken from the plaintiffs in 186[9] and 1870.\" They do not seek the return of land held by private parties.</p>\n<p>On May 6, 2009, after a hearing on the Commonwealth and Town's separate motions to dismiss, the district court granted the motions and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <i>See Bingham I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1259963</span></span>, at *1-2.

Plaintiffs must show they had an individual interest in the property rights granted in the seventeenth-century deeds in order to show they were personally injured by the later state actions affecting those property rights. Plaintiffs can do so only if the deeds conveyed to plaintiffs' individual ancestors discrete property interests that passed through successive generations. Even when viewing all facts in the light <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> most favorable to plaintiffs, and taking all reasonable inferences in their favor, plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to surmount this bar.</p>\n<p>The relevant language in the 1665 deed conveyed the subject lands to \"the South Sea Indians: and their[] Children for ever: and not to be sold or given away from them by any one: without all their[] Consents there unto.\" The 1685 grant contained similar material language. In plaintiffs' favor, we will assume, as the district court did, that the reference to the \"South Sea Indians . . . and their[] children\" is ambiguous.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs insist the deed and grant did not convey the lands to the collective members of the tribe in common. Under that interpretation, the ownership of the land would belong to the tribe as a whole, and no individual member would have a personal interest in a particular share of the property. <i>See</i> N. Newton et. al., <i>Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law</i> § 16.01[2], at 1037 (2005 ed.). Only the tribe would have standing to sue for any injury to its interests under the deed. Plaintiffs argue the deed must be read as conveying individual interests in the land to individual tribal members.</p>\n<p>We need not determine whether the conveyances were to individual tribal members or to the collective tribe, because plaintiffs lack standing under either interpretation. Plaintiffs do not represent the tribe, nor do they claim the capacity to do so. Plaintiffs cannot assert the rights of the tribe, as an entity, simply by styling their claim as a class action on behalf of all tribal descendants.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Even assuming arguendo that the deed conveyed discrete property rights to the tribe's individual members, plaintiffs still cannot show a personal injury. Plaintiffs have alleged they are direct descendants of South Sea Indian grantees who were the original beneficiaries of the deeds. Plaintiffs have not, however, alleged any facts showing that their ancestors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> actually held an individual, inheritable interest in the subject land that passed through successive generations. And they have not alleged any facts showing their ancestors actually held individual and inheritable interests in the subject land as of 1869-70.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have also failed to allege that any such interests were affected as a result of the 1869 and 1870 acts in ways that resulted in the transfer or loss of ownership of those lands. Nor have they pled any facts showing that the loss of any \"right\" to hold the lands in perpetuity has caused them any injury. Plaintiffs say that \"[t]hrough\" the 1870 act, between 1870 and the present, many of the subject lands were ultimately conveyed to non-Indians, but a vague allegation of harms occurring over an undefined, 140-year time period is not the kind of concrete, particularized injury required to show standing. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span>, 325-26 (1st Cir.2009). These shortcomings are fatal to plaintiffs' ability to show that they had an identifiable personal stake in the property rights at issue and that they suffered a concrete injury fairly traceable to the Commonwealth's allegedly unlawful conduct. This holding, of lack of pleading of individual harm from the 1869-1870 acts, also disposes of their procedural due process claim, which fails for futility.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue the district court erred when it dismissed their complaint sua sponte on the ground that the Binghams failed to allege sufficient genealogical data to support individual interest standing and they could not assert standing on behalf of the tribe. The Town's motion to dismiss had argued only that the tribe, not individual tribal members, had standing to sue for injuries to property interests granted in the seventeenth-century deeds. The Town did not address, until its reply brief to the motion for reconsideration, the issue of lack of individual interest standing.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' motion to reconsider and to amend their complaint to add the names of ancestors going back to the 1665 and 1667 deeds, dates of birth and death for previous generations, and the names of ancestors who were grantees under the deeds would, as we have held, not have changed the outcome. In light of that futility, there was no error in denial of reconsideration and the motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p>The judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Our review of a motion to dismiss on grounds of standing is ordinarily confined to the complaint and to \"further particularized allegations of fact deemed supportive of plaintiff's standing.\" <i>Warth v.

However, the text of the deeds and earlier judicial opinions addressing prior, related claims to the land in the Town fall under a narrow exception, which allows courts to additionally consider \"official public records\" and \"documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint,\" among other materials. <i>Alt.

Acts ch. 463, § 1.</p>\n<p>[5]  The 1869 act permitted but did not require any Indian to alienate his lands. 1869 Mass. Acts ch. 463, § 2. Some have viewed the act as beneficial to the Indians because it added to the bundle of property rights the same rights of alienation as others held. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>James,</i> 716 F.2d at 75. Plaintiffs' complaint simply alleges the act was a source of unidentified harm to their ancestors' property rights.</p>\n<p>[6]  Plaintiffs did not assert claims under any other specific constitutional provisions or statutes applicable to Indian tribes, such as the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, or the Indian Nonintercourse Act (INA), 25 U.S.C. § 177. Plaintiffs have also consistently portrayed the instruments at issue as deeds, not treaties.\n</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' complaint cursorily asserted that the Town and Commonwealth had \"violated the plaintiffs' rights pursuant to federal common law and federal Indian policies through their ongoing claim, holding, and/or use and occupancy of portions of the subject land.\" That language is too vague to state a claim on these grounds under any standard.</p>\n<p>[7]  We bypass the Commonwealth's arguments that our precedents involving these instruments conclusively interpreted this language. The Commonwealth cites <i>Mashpee I,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1620875\"><a href=\"/opinion/1620875/mashpee-tribe-v-town-of-mashpee/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In neither case was the district court faced with construing the 1665 deed. And those arguments were not at issue in the appeals to this circuit, which affirmed on other grounds not relevant to the issue of land status.\n</p>\n<p>Indeed, those earlier cases concerning the Mashpee Tribe's claims to the subject lands at issue here concerned different issues entirely. <i>Mashpee I</i> primarily discussed claims under the INA asserted by the \"Mashpee Tribe\" as a collective tribe. Plaintiffs' primary theory was that the 1869 and 1870 acts lifted restraints on alienation in violation of the INA, which permits only the federal government to do so. <i>See </i><i>New Seabury Corp.,</i> 592 F.2d at 579; <i>Mashpee I,</i> 447 F.Supp. at 942-43. <i>Mashpee II</i> involved claims under the INA, Indian Commerce Clause, and Supremacy Clause by individual tribal members as well as the tribe. The district court held, and this circuit affirmed, that only the tribe had standing to bring such claims and that <i>Mashpee I</i> had conclusively established that the Mashpee Tribe was not recognized as a tribe under federal law. 707 F.2d at 24-25, 542 F.Supp. at 800-06. We do not decide what effect the Department of the Interior's 2007 designation of the Mashpee Wampanoag as a federally recognized tribe has on those opinions.</p>\n<p>[8]  Indeed, the tribe and its authorized representatives have repeatedly and strenuously disavowed plaintiffs' suit. In April 2008, the tribe entered into an agreement with the Town in which it received certain Town lands in exchange for waiving all claims to property located within the Town. On November 5, 2008, the tribe further distanced itself from plaintiffs' suit, formally resolving at a tribal council meeting that \"the Tribal Counsel condemns the land claim action brought by Steven Bingham and Amelia Bingham.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
