D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                  Torruella, Lipez and Thompson,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bruce M. Merrill, P.A., on brief for appellant.\n     Renée M. Bunker, Assistant U.S. Attorney and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             August 5, 2010\n\f              Per Curiam. Defendant-appellant Joshua Bach, who entered\n\na conditional guilty plea to one count of possessing a computer\n\nthat contained images of child pornography, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2252A(a)(5)(B) and 2256(8)(A), files this direct criminal\n\nappeal to challenge the district court's denial of his motion to\n\nsuppress computer files seized from his home during a warrantless\n\nsearch by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\")\n\nagents.    He disputes the district court's determination that his\n\nconsent to the search was voluntary.1          Appellant also contends that\n\nthe search was invalid because it was begun before he signed the\n\nwritten consent form, contrary to the district court's finding.\n\nThirdly, he argues that even if his consent was voluntarily and\n\ntimely given, the items seized were beyond the scope of his\n\nconsent.      Finally, appellant contends that the district court did\n\nnot   apply    de   novo   review   in   adopting   the   Magistrate   Judge's\n\nRecommended Decision, to which appellant had objected, in violation\n\nof 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C).              Finding none of these claims on\n\nappeal to have merit, we summarily affirm.\n\n              I. Voluntariness of Consent\n\n              Because the ICE agents did not have a warrant to search\n\nBach's home or his computer, they relied upon an exception to the\n\nwarrant requirement for consensual searches. \"In order for consent\n\n\n      1\n       References to the district court's determinations and\nfindings are references to the magistrate judge's Recommended\nDecision since the district court adopted it in full.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fto be valid, the Government must prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the consenting party gave it freely and voluntarily.\n\nThe assessment of whether consent is free and voluntary is a\n\nquestion of fact that requires an examination of the totality of\n\nthe circumstances surrounding the relevant transaction between law-\n\nenforcement authorities and the consenting party.               The district\n\ncourt's factual findings relating to the validity of the consent\n\nare reviewed for clear error.\"         United States v. Jones, 523 F.3d\n\n31, 37 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            Appellant argues that his consent was not voluntary under\n\nthe totality of the circumstances, \"given the length of time that\n\nAppellant was questioned (90 minutes), in a confined space, by two\n\nagents who were openly displaying weapons, and who did not advise\n\nhim of his right to refuse consent.\"          Examination of each of those\n\nfactors,    and   consideration   of   them    in    combination,     does   not\n\nestablish    that    the   district    court        clearly   erred    in    its\n\ndetermination that Bach's consent to the computer search was\n\nvoluntary.\n\n            Length of Time.       According to the district court's\n\nfindings, approximately 50 minutes passed from the time when the\n\nICE agents first asked Bach if they could search his computer (at\n\n4:30 or 4:35) and when he signed the written consent form (at 5:20\n\np.m.), and the entire length of time that the police were in Bach's\n\nhome was just under two hours.         It was not clearly erroneous for\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthe district court to conclude that this duration of time was\n\ninsufficient to render the consent involuntary, especially where it\n\nfurther found that during the elapsed time, Bach \"carefully read a\n\nwritten consent form and asked a number of questions, to which\n\npolice gave truthful answers, in an attempt to make a fully-\n\ninformed decision.\"    Compare United States v. Ivy, 165 F.3d 397,\n\n402 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that consent to search was involuntary\n\nwhere one and a half hours passed between the officers' initial\n\nrequest for consent and Ivy's ultimate decision to sign the consent\n\nform, the \"entire incident\" took from seven to eight hours, and\n\n\"the   police   officers   used   unlawful   threats   to   secure   Ivy's\n\nconsent\").   Nor did the fact that the officers twice asked Bach to\n\nread and consider signing the consent form render the eventual\n\nconsent involuntary.       See Jones, 254 F.3d at 696 (stating that\n\nthere is \"no legal rule that asking more than once for permission\n\nto search renders a suspect's consent involuntary, particularly\n\nwhere the suspect's initial response is ambiguous\").\n\n           Confined Space & Open Display of Weapons.        The district\n\ncourt found that \"[a]t no time did the agents restrict [Bach's]\n\nfreedom of movement, refer to their weapons, or tell the defendant\n\nhe was in custody.\" The agents' weapons were \"visibly holstered at\n\ntheir belts,\" but Bach testified that they never unholstered their\n\nweapons.   See United States v. Pena, 143 F.3d 1363, 1367 (10th Cir.\n\n1998) (holding that consent was voluntary notwithstanding presence\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fof four armed officers where \"none of the officers unholstered his\n\nfirearm\"); United States v. Baker, 78 F.3d 1241, 1244 (7th Cir.\n\n1996)(holding that consent was voluntary even though the officer\n\nhad his hand on his gun, where he \"never drew it out of his\n\nholster\").   The mere presence of visible weapons is not enough to\n\nrender Bach's consent involuntary.\n\n           Bach argues that he was in a \"confined space\" when he\n\nconsented, which he maintains supports a finding that the consent\n\nwas not voluntary.       However, consent is most likely to be found to\n\nbe involuntary where it occurs in a \"stationhouse atmosphere,\"\n\nrather than in \"familiar surroundings.\" 4 Wayne R. LaFave, Search\n\nand Seizure, § 8.2(b) (4th ed. 2004)(collecting cases).            Here, the\n\nfact that Bach was in his own home when he consented to the search\n\nweighs in favor of finding that consent was given voluntarily. See\n\nUnited   States   v.     Blakeney,   942   F.2d   1001,    1016   (6th   Cir.\n\n1991)(holding     that     defendant's     consent   was    voluntary     and\n\nemphasizing that his \"consent was not given in a police station,\n\nbut at his home\").\n\n           Notification of Right to Refuse Consent. The Magistrate-\n\nJudge concluded that he was\n\n           satisfied, from the evidence as a whole,\n           including the defendant's background and\n           intelligence, the wording on the form itself,\n           and the many questions he asked agents, to\n           which essentially accurate responses were\n           provided, that he was effectively apprised\n           that he had a right to refuse consent, and\n           that if he did so, agents would be obliged to\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          obtain a      search   warrant    to   search   the\n          computer.\n\nBased upon our review of the transcript of the hearing on the\n\nmotion to suppress, that finding is supported by \"a reasonable view\n\nof the evidence,\" and is not clearly erroneous.       United States v.\n\nCoraine, 198 F.3d 306, 308 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          The magistrate judge rejected Bach's testimony that Agent\n\nMcDonnell had told him that if he did not consent they would \"go\n\nget a search warrant\" (rather than \"apply\" for a search warrant, as\n\nMcDonnell testified).     The former version of events would lend\n\nsupport to Bach's argument that the consent was involuntary.      See\n\n4 Search and Seizure, § 8.2(c).         However, the district court's\n\nchoice to credit Agent McDonnell's testimony, which \"comport[ed]\n\nwith [Agent] Madden's contemporaneous handwritten notes,\" was not\n\nclearly erroneous.    See Coraine, 198 F.3d at 310.\n\n          II. Timing of Consent\n\n          Appellant argues that the consent was invalid because it\n\noccurred only after the search had commenced.       The district court\n\nfound that Agent McDonnell \"did not begin to run the pre-search\n\nsoftware until the defendant finally signed the written consent\n\nform.\" Appellant maintains that \"[t]here exists a serious question\n\nas to whether that consent was obtained before or after the pre-\n\nsearch software was inserted into Appellant's computer and run.\"\n\n          \"In the absence of a reason not to do so, this court\n\ndefers to the district court's personal observations and evaluation\n\n                                  -6-\n\fof the witnesses' credibility.\" United States v. Marshall, 348 F.3d\n\n281, 286 (1st Cir. 2003). The magistrate judge explained at length\n\nits   reasoning for crediting Agent McDonnell's testimony regarding\n\nthe timing of the consent over Bach's version of events.       The\n\nrecord supports the district court's finding in this regard, and\n\nappellant has not shown that it is clearly erroneous. See Coraine,\n\n198 F.3d at 308 (\"the district court's findings of fact deserve\n\ndeference so long as a reasonable view of the evidence will support\n\nthem\").\n\n           III. Scope of Consent\n\n           Appellant argues that even if he voluntarily signed the\n\nwritten consent form before the computer search began, the evidence\n\nseized should have been suppressed because it did not fall within\n\nthe scope of his consent. Bypassing the question whether appellant\n\nwaived this argument because he raised it for the first time in his\n\nobjection to the Recommended Decision of the magistrate judge, we\n\nconclude that in any event it is unavailing.\n\n           \"'A consensual search may not exceed the scope of the\n\nconsent given.'\" United States v. Turner, 169 F.3d 84, 87 (1st Cir.\n\n1999)(citation omitted).     In determining the scope of consent\n\ngiven, this court employs an \"objective reasonableness\" standard,\n\nand \"look[s] beyond the language of the consent itself, to the\n\noverall context, which necessarily encompasses contemporaneous\n\npolice statements and actions.\" Id.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f              Appellant argues that the language of the written consent\n\nform authorized the ICE agents to search his computer only for\n\nimages of children \"engaged in adult sexual activities\" and that\n\nthe    images    on   his   computer     did   not   fall    within   that      scope.\n\nHowever, Agent McDonnell testified at the evidentiary hearing\n\nbefore the magistrate judge that after Bach received the written\n\nconsent form, but before he signed it, McDonnell \"informed Mr. Bach\n\nthat    the     federal     statute    covering      the    definition     of   child\n\npornography included the lascivious display of the genitals of a\n\nchild under age 18.\"         Bach admitted that McDonnell had \"told [him]\n\nthe definition of child pornography.\"\n\n              Given   the    undisputed    evidence        that   Agent    McDonnell\n\nexplained to Bach, before he signed the written consent form, the\n\ndefinition of the child pornography which was the object of the\n\nsearch, the items seized (which fit within the stated definition)\n\nwere within the scope of the consent.                      See United States v.\n\nBrenton-Farley, 607 F.3d 1294, 1332, (11th Cir. 2010)(holding that\n\ndefendant's       consent     to   the   search      of    his    laptop   computer\n\nencompassed the child pornography evidence because by the time\n\ndefendant consented to the search \"he was well aware of the true\n\nsubject of the investigation\").\n\n              IV. De Novo Review by the District Court\n\n              Appellant has not identified any legal authority for his\n\ncontention that the district court's order adopting a magistrate\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fjudge's decision must include an express statement that it has\n\napplied de novo review (although it is the better practice).\n\nAlthough the district court was \"required to review the magistrate\n\njudge's decision de novo, 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C),\" Jonco, LLC v.\n\nALI, Inc., 157 F.3d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 1998), it was not required to\n\nmake \"separate findings of fact or issue an opinion setting forth\n\nits own reasoning.\"   Id.   \"The statute authorizes the district\n\ncourt to adopt in whole as well as in part the proposed findings or\n\nrecommendations of the magistrate judge.\"   Elmendorf Grafica, Inc.\n\nv. D.S. America (East), Inc., 48 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nDespite the district court's failure to expressly state that it had\n\nengaged in de novo review, appellant has not demonstrated that the\n\ndistrict court failed to do so.      See Claude v. Peikes, 534 F.3d\n\n801, 801 (2d Cir. 2008)(adopting rule that district court is\n\npresumed to have conducted a de novo review of a magistrate judge's\n\nreport and recommendation absent some clear indication otherwise).\n\n          Affirmed. See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

However, consent is most likely to be found to\n\nbe involuntary where it occurs in a \"stationhouse atmosphere,\"\n\nrather than in \"familiar surroundings.\" 4 Wayne R. LaFave, Search\n\nand Seizure, § 8.2(b) (4th ed. 2004)(collecting cases).            Here, the\n\nfact that Bach was in his own home when he consented to the search\n\nweighs in favor of finding that consent was given voluntarily. See\n\nUnited   States   v.     Blakeney,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567212\"><a href=\"/opinion/567212/united-states-v-roy-c-blakeney-90-5664-kenneth-a-kutnyak-90-5665/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>   <span class=\"page\">1001</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    1016   (6th   Cir.\n\n1991)(holding     that     defendant's     consent   was    voluntary     and\n\nemphasizing that his \"consent was not given in a police station,\n\nbut at his home\").\n\n           Notification of Right to Refuse Consent. The Magistrate-\n\nJudge concluded that he was\n\n           satisfied, from the evidence as a whole,\n           including the defendant's background and\n           intelligence, the wording on the form itself,\n           and the many questions he asked agents, to\n           which essentially accurate responses were\n           provided, that he was effectively apprised\n           that he had a right to refuse consent, and\n           that if he did so, agents would be obliged to\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          obtain a      search   warrant    to   search   the\n          computer.\n\nBased upon our review of the transcript of the hearing on the\n\nmotion to suppress, that finding is supported by \"a reasonable view\n\nof the evidence,\" and is not clearly erroneous.       United States v.\n\nCoraine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198757\"><a href=\"/opinion/198757/united-states-v-coraine/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          The magistrate judge rejected Bach's testimony that Agent\n\nMcDonnell had told him that if he did not consent they would \"go\n\nget a search warrant\" (rather than \"apply\" for a search warrant, as\n\nMcDonnell testified).     The former version of events would lend\n\nsupport to Bach's argument that the consent was involuntary.      See\n\n4 Search and Seizure, § 8.2(c).         However, the district court's\n\nchoice to credit Agent McDonnell's testimony, which \"comport[ed]\n\nwith [Agent] Madden's contemporaneous handwritten notes,\" was not\n\nclearly erroneous.    See Coraine, 198 F.3d at 310.\n\n          II. Timing of Consent\n\n          Appellant argues that the consent was invalid because it\n\noccurred only after the search had commenced.       The district court\n\nfound that Agent McDonnell \"did not begin to run the pre-search\n\nsoftware until the defendant finally signed the written consent\n\nform.\" Appellant maintains that \"[t]here exists a serious question\n\nas to whether that consent was obtained before or after the pre-\n\nsearch software was inserted into Appellant's computer and run.\"\n\n          \"In the absence of a reason not to do so, this court\n\ndefers to the district court's personal observations and evaluation\n\n                                  -6-\n\fof the witnesses' credibility.\" United States v. Marshall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200712\"><a href=\"/opinion/200712/united-states-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286 (1st Cir. 2003). The magistrate judge explained at length\n\nits   reasoning for crediting Agent McDonnell's testimony regarding\n\nthe timing of the consent over Bach's version of events.       The\n\nrecord supports the district court's finding in this regard, and\n\nappellant has not shown that it is clearly erroneous. See Coraine,\n\n198 F.3d at 308 (\"the district court's findings of fact deserve\n\ndeference so long as a reasonable view of the evidence will support\n\nthem\").\n\n           III. Scope of Consent\n\n           Appellant argues that even if he voluntarily signed the\n\nwritten consent form before the computer search began, the evidence\n\nseized should have been suppressed because it did not fall within\n\nthe scope of his consent. Bypassing the question whether appellant\n\nwaived this argument because he raised it for the first time in his\n\nobjection to the Recommended Decision of the magistrate judge, we\n\nconclude that in any event it is unavailing.\n\n           \"'A consensual search may not exceed the scope of the\n\nconsent given.'\" United States v.

In determining the scope of consent\n\ngiven, this court employs an \"objective reasonableness\" standard,\n\nand \"look[s] beyond the language of the consent itself, to the\n\noverall context, which necessarily encompasses contemporaneous\n\npolice statements and actions.\" Id.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f              Appellant argues that the language of the written consent\n\nform authorized the ICE agents to search his computer only for\n\nimages of children \"engaged in adult sexual activities\" and that\n\nthe    images    on   his   computer     did   not   fall    within   that      scope.\n\nHowever, Agent McDonnell testified at the evidentiary hearing\n\nbefore the magistrate judge that after Bach received the written\n\nconsent form, but before he signed it, McDonnell \"informed Mr. Bach\n\nthat    the     federal     statute    covering      the    definition     of   child\n\npornography included the lascivious display of the genitals of a\n\nchild under age 18.\"         Bach admitted that McDonnell had \"told [him]\n\nthe definition of child pornography.\"\n\n              Given   the    undisputed    evidence        that   Agent    McDonnell\n\nexplained to Bach, before he signed the written consent form, the\n\ndefinition of the child pornography which was the object of the\n\nsearch, the items seized (which fit within the stated definition)\n\nwere within the scope of the consent.

De Novo Review by the District Court\n\n              Appellant has not identified any legal authority for his\n\ncontention that the district court's order adopting a magistrate\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fjudge's decision must include an express statement that it has\n\napplied de novo review (although it is the better practice).\n\nAlthough the district court was \"required to review the magistrate\n\njudge's decision de novo, 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C),\" Jonco, LLC v.\n\nALI, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198163\"><a href=\"/opinion/198163/jonco-llc-v-ali-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (1st Cir. 1998), it was not required to\n\nmake \"separate findings of fact or issue an opinion setting forth\n\nits own reasoning.\"   Id.   \"The statute authorizes the district\n\ncourt to adopt in whole as well as in part the proposed findings or\n\nrecommendations of the magistrate judge.\"   Elmendorf Grafica, Inc.\n\nv.
