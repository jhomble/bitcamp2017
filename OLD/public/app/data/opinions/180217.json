Grindler, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Rosa E.\nRodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson J. Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, were on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         December 1, 2010\n\f           BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.   This appeal by several defendants\n\nconvicted of drug trafficking--Epifanio Matos-Luchi, Manolo Soto-\n\nPerez, and Ramon Carrasco-Carrasco--requires the interpretation of\n\nthe Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (\"MDLEA\"), 46 U.S.C. §§ 70501\n\net seq. (2006), which inter alia delineates federal enforcement\n\nauthority over drug crimes carried on at sea outside U.S. territorial\n\nlimits. The factual background and proceedings in the district court\n\nare as follows.\n\n           In May 2007, Petty Officer Richard Young and a team of\n\nfive other U.S. Coast Guard personnel were stationed on the HMS\n\nOcean, a British aircraft carrier, to assist with law enforcement\n\nefforts in the Carribean Sea.       On May 12, the Coast Guard team\n\ndeployed in a helicopter to investigate a low-flying airplane spotted\n\nin the vicinity; from the air, they saw the plane drop several bale-\n\nshaped packages into the sea about thirty to thirty-five miles from\n\nthe coast of the Dominican Republic.1\n\n           A small boat waiting nearby--a twenty to twenty-five foot\n\nfishing \"yola\" propelled by an outboard motor and allegedly crewed by\n\nthe three defendants--then approached the drop site and began to\n\nretrieve the bales.    The officers suspected drug trafficking and\n\ndescended in the helicopter.   The boat crew jettisoned the bales and\n\n\n     1\n      The area is outside Dominican territorial waters and considered\nthe \"high seas\" for purposes of the Coast Guard's enforcement\njurisdiction, 14 U.S.C. § 89(a) (2006); 33 C.F.R. § 2.32(c) (2009),\nalthough within the Dominican Republic's exclusive economic zone, id.\n§ 2.30(b).\n\n                                 -2-\n\ffled.        After giving chase for nearly an hour, the Coast Guard\n\nhelicopter returned to the drop site to retrieve the bales, which\n\nproved to contain packages of cocaine.\n\n               While the helicopter retrieved the drugs, a U.S. Customs\n\nand Border Protection airplane followed the yola as it proceeded\n\nnorth towards the Dominican Republic.         The boat experienced engine\n\nproblems and halted about twenty-five miles from the Dominican coast.\n\nAt the request of the U.S. Customs officials, a Dominican Coast Guard\n\ncutter sailed out to retrieve the yola and its crew.        The three crew\n\nmembers were taken on board the cutter and the yola was tied to its\n\nstern.\n\n               Later that evening, Young and two others traveled from the\n\nHMS Ocean to the Dominican cutter where, with the permission of the\n\nDominican authorities, they questioned the three defendants who now\n\nwere    on    board   the   cutter.   Young   later   testified   that   when\n\nquestioned, Matos, Soto and Carrasco declined to make a claim of\n\nnationality for the yola:\n\n               I asked . . . who was the captain of the\n               vessel they were on or the senior person in\n               charge of the boat, and they responded there\n               was no single person in charge. Since I could\n               not determine if there was a captain of the\n               vessel, I asked if anybody would like to speak\n               for the boat and give me a claim of\n               nationality. And they shook their heads no,\n               and actually did not give me a full response.\n               Because I could not get one individual to make\n               a claim for the vessel, I then questioned what\n               was the nationality of the personnel.      And\n               they had all told me and informed me that they\n               were from the Dominican Republic. I asked if\n\n                                      -3-\n\f             the boat had come from the Dominican Republic\n             as well, and they, in turn, agreed.\n\n             While Young interrogated the yola crew, another Coast\n\nGuard officer boarded the yola, now tied to the stern of the cutter.\n\nNo ensign, flag, registration, or other evidence of the vessel's\n\nnationality was found on board.                 The U.S. Coast Guard crew were\n\ninstructed by their superiors to detain the defendants, who were\n\ntransferred to the HMS Ocean and then brought to Puerto Rico for\n\nprosecution in federal district court.\n\n             The defendants were charged by indictment with violations\n\nof the MDLEA: one count of possessing cocaine with the intent to\n\ndistribute, 46 U.S.C. § 70503, and one count of aiding and abetting\n\nthat crime, 18 U.S.C. § 2 (2006), all while on board a \"vessel\n\nwithout nationality\" and so within the enforcement authority of the\n\nUnited   States,    46     U.S.C.   §§ 70502(c)(1)(A),       70503(a)(1).          The\n\ndefendants    moved        to   dismiss    the      indictment     \"for     lack    of\n\njurisdiction,\" arguing that there was no proof that they were on\n\nboard a \"vessel without nationality\" as alleged in the indictment.\n\nThe district court held that motion in abeyance, and the defendants\n\nproceeded to trial.\n\n             When    the    government     rested     its   case   in     chief,   the\n\ndefendants sought a judgment of acquittal from the court, repeating\n\nthat there was no proof that they were on board a \"vessel without\n\nnationality.\"       The court denied the motion.             The most extensive\n\nexplanation given by the judge, provided in response to defense\n\n                                          -4-\n\fcounsel's repeated efforts to have the jury instructed on the issue,\n\nwas as follows:\n\n            Title [46], the law defines a vessel without\n            nationality. And look at this. A vessel on\n            which the master or individual in charge--you\n            need a master or individual in charge, to\n            begin with--fails on request of an officer of\n            the United States, authorized to enforce\n            applicable United States law, to make a claim\n            of nationality or registry for that vessel.\n            . . . .\n                    And then what happens on top of that,\n            you have a vessel that is in international\n            waters, no written registration on the\n            outside. No name, no flying flag, no nothing.\n            . . . .\n                    I believe it is entirely up to me to\n            make a determination as to jurisdiction, and\n            I'm convinced that there is jurisdiction, so I\n            cannot    ask   the   jury   to    make   that\n            determination.\n\n            Ultimately,   the   jury   found   the   defendants   guilty   as\n\ncharged of possession with intent to distribute the seized drugs.\n\nConformably with the statute, the issue of whether the vessel was\n\nwithout nationality was not submitted to the jury.         See 46 U.S.C. §\n\n70504(a).   Based on the weight of the cocaine recovered--which was\n\n386 kilograms--the defendants were later each sentenced to 235\n\nmonths' imprisonment.     This appeal followed.\n\n            The most abstruse issue in the case, with which we begin,\n\nis whether the defendants' possession of the cocaine with intent to\n\ndistribute occurred on board \"a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of\n\nthe United States,\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1).          To put the issue in\n\ncontext requires an understanding of the design and background the\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fMDLEA--a statute initially enacted in 1986 as 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903,\n\nsee Pub. L. No. 99-570, § 3202, 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-95 to -97\n\n(1986), and later relocated to its present code sections, 46 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 70501-70507, see Pub. L. No. 109-304, § 10(2), 120 Stat. 1485,\n\n1685-89 (2006).\n\n            Invoking its constitutional power \"[t]o define and punish\n\nPiracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas,\" U.S. Const. art.\n\nI, § 8, cl. 10, Congress in the MDLEA made it unlawful inter alia for\n\nanyone to\n\n            knowingly or intentionally manufacture or\n            distribute,   or  possess   with   intent   to\n            manufacture   or  distribute,   a   controlled\n            substance on board . . . a vessel subject to\n            the jurisdiction of the United States . . .\n            even though the act is committed outside the\n            territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)-(b).2\n\n            Underscoring its aim to reach broadly, Congress defined \"a\n\nvessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" to include\n\nsix categories of boats (listed in full in an appendix to this\n\ndecision)--first among them \"a vessel without nationality,\" 46 U.S.C.\n\n§ 70502(c)(1)(A).\n\n            In turn, \"a vessel without nationality\" is defined to\n\n\"include[]\" the following:\n\n\n     2\n      The same prohibition applies to such conduct by anyone onboard\n\"a vessel of the United States,\" id. § 70503(a)(1), or \"any vessel if\nthe individual is a citizen of the United States or a resident alien\nof the United States,\" id. § 70503(a)(2); but neither of these\nconditions was satisfied in this case.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           (A) a vessel aboard which the master or\n           individual in charge makes a claim of registry\n           that is denied by the nation whose registry is\n           claimed;\n           (B) a vessel aboard which the master or\n           individual in charge fails, on request of an\n           officer of the United States authorized to\n           enforce applicable provisions of United States\n           law, to make a claim of nationality or\n           registry for that vessel; and\n           (C) a vessel aboard which the master or\n           individual in charge makes a claim of registry\n           for which the claimed nation of registry does\n           not affirmatively and unequivocally assert\n           that the vessel is of its nationality.\n\n46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1).\n\n           That the listed examples do not exhaust the scope of\n\nsection 70502(d) is confirmed by Congress' contrasting use of the\n\nphrase \"includes only\" in a related provision,3 by its evident and\n\nexplicit attempts to sweep quite broadly, see, e.g., S. Rep. 99-530,\n\nat 15-16 (1986), and by relevant precedent, United States v. Rosero,\n\n42 F.3d 166, 170 (3d Cir. 1994) (Alito, J.).     At the very least,\n\nCongress intended to include in section 70502(d), in addition to the\n\nspecific examples given, those vessels that could be considered\n\n\n\n     3\n      The term \"claim of nationality or registry\" in subsection (d)\nis defined in subsection (e) such that it\n\n     includes only--\n     (1) possession on board the vessel and production of\n     documents evidencing the vessel's nationality as provided\n     in article 5 of the 1958 Convention on the High Seas;\n     (2) flying its nation's ensign or flag; or\n     (3) a verbal claim of nationality or registry by the master\n     or individual in charge of the vessel.\n\n46 U.S.C. § 70502(e).\n\n                                -7-\n\fstateless under customary international law. Id. at 170-71; see also\n\nH.R.       Rep.   No.    96-323,      at   23-24    (1979)   (discussing     predecessor\n\nstatute).\n\n                  Congress' intent to reach broadly was reconfirmed in the\n\nCoast Guard Authorization Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-324, § 1138,\n\n110 Stat. 3901, 3988-89, which amended the MDLEA by providing that\n\nthe \"jurisdiction\" of the United States over a vessel under the MDLEA\n\nwas \"not an element of the offense\" but a matter to be determined\n\n\"solely by the trial judge,\" id. § 1138(a)(5) (now codified at 46\n\nU.S.C. § 70504(a)), and that a defendant had no standing to claim\n\nthat       enforcement         violated     \"international         law\"--reserving    such\n\nobjections only to foreign nations, id. § 1138(a)(4) (now codified at\n\n46 U.S.C. § 70505).4\n\n                  Against       this       background,       the      district     court's\n\ndetermination           that    the    defendants'    yola    was    \"a   vessel   without\n\nnationality\" within the meaning of the MDLEA was correct.                        This is so\n\nregardless of whether that finding is to be made by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence--as one of our earlier decisions implies, Vilches-\n\nNavarrete, 523 F.3d at 20 (separate opinion of Lynch & Howard, JJ.)--\n\n\n\n       4\n      \"Jurisdiction\" in this context refers to the enforcement reach\nof the statute--not federal court subject-matter jurisdiction, which\nextends to any federal felony. United States v. González, 311 F.3d\n440, 443 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 826 (2003). That\nreach was limited by Congress to minimize conflict with foreign\nnations who might also assert rights to regulate. See United States\nv. Vilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 22 (1st Cir.) (separate opinion of\nLynch & Howard, JJ.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 208 (2008).\n\n                                              -8-\n\for beyond a reasonable doubt.        Indeed, virtually none of the raw\n\nfacts bearing on the reach of the statute is disputed; the problem is\n\nprimarily one of interpreting the statute.\n\n               Still, the burden of proof question is likely to be a\n\nrecurring one for district courts within the circuit.           In our view,\n\nCongress intended it to be a preliminary issue, like venue and other\n\njudge-determined issues, to be proven by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence. In González, 311 F.3d at 443, we likened U.S. jurisdiction\n\nover a vessel to statutory language that signals Congress' invocation\n\nof its own authority, like \"affects interstate commerce\"; but unlike\n\nother   such    \"jurisdictional   hooks\"   decided   by   a   jury   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt, the reach of the statute in this case is not an\n\nelement of the offense, 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a).\n\n               Our reading--requiring proof only to a preponderance--is\n\ncommon to many judge-determined issues, e.g., United States v.\n\nVanvliet, 542 F.3d 259, 264 (1st Cir. 2008) (consent to search);\n\nUnited States v. Schussel, 291 F. App'x 336, 343 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(unpublished) (existence of privilege); United States v. Rojas-Tapia,\n\n446 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.) (voluntariness of confession), cert. denied,\n\n549 U.S. 905 (2006); United States v. Garza, 435 F.3d 73, 77 (1st\n\nCir.) (admissibility of evidence), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1158\n\n(2006); United States v. Wiggin, 429 F.3d 31, 36-37 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(competency to stand trial); United States v. Cordero, 668 F.2d 32,\n\n44 n.18 (1st Cir. 1981) (propriety of venue), and it here comports\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fwith Congress' aim to facilitate enforcement.                 Defendants raise no\n\nconstitutional objection on this issue, and we see none.5\n\n                 Turning now to the issue of the yola as a stateless\n\nvessel, viewed in part retrospectively, the boat had various links to\n\nthe Dominican Republic.               The crew members were Dominicans and the\n\nsmall vessel was likely headed there before its engine troubles and\n\nsubsequent interception by the Dominican Coast Guard.                 At trial one\n\ndefendant said that the vessel was registered there in some fashion.\n\nBut neither the MDLEA nor international law limits U.S. enforcement\n\nauthority merely because the vessel has associations with another\n\nstate.\n\n                 Under international law, every vessel must sail under the\n\nflag of one and only one state; those that sail under no flag or more\n\nthan       one   flag    enjoy   no     legal   protection.      1   L.   Oppenheim,\n\nInternational Law § 261, at 595-96 (H. Lauterpacht ed., 8th ed.\n\n1955); see also Convention on the High Seas art. 6, Apr. 29, 1958, 13\n\nU.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82; United States v. Victoria, 876 F.2d\n\n1009,      1010-11      (1st   Cir.    1989).

But see United States v. Perlaza, 439 F.3d 1149, 1167\n(9th Cir. 2006).    In criminal cases, jury fact-finding and the\nbeyond-reasonable-doubt standard generally go hand in hand. Sullivan\nv.

Without a flag\n\nor papers, a vessel may also traditionally make an oral claim of\n\nnationality      when   a   proper   demand    is   made--a     pattern    the    MDLEA\n\nfollows.      See supra note 3 (quoting 46 U.S.C. § 70502(e)).6\n\n               Although enforcement jurisdiction presumptively lies with\n\nthe flag state, 1 Oppenheim, supra, § 266, at 603, \"[i]t is not\n\nenough that a vessel have a nationality; she must claim it and be in\n\na position to provide evidence of it.\"               Anderson, supra note 6, at\n\n341.

Att'y-Gen. for Palestine, [1948] A.C. 351 (P.C.) 369-70;\n\nsee also 1 Oppenheim, supra, § 261, at 595.\n\n               The   MDLEA    follows    this       approach,    one      might    say,\n\nenergetically.       Section 70502(d) \"includes\" in the phrase \"vessel\n\n\n\n       6\n      See also Anderson, Jurisdiction over Stateless Vessels on the\nHigh Seas: An Appraisal Under Domestic and International Law, 13 J.\nMar. L. & Com. 323, 341 (1982). On the traditional right to approach\na suspect vessel to verify its nationality, see 1 Oppenheim, supra,\n§ 266, at 604.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fwithout nationality\" those ships for which a claim of nationality is\n\nmade but rejected or not backed up by the nation invoked, 46 U.S.C.\n\n§   70502(d)(1)(A),   (C),   or   those     \"aboard   which   the       master   of\n\nindividual   in   charge\"    fails   on   request     \"to   make    a    claim   of\n\nnationality or registration\" for the vessel, id. § 70502(d)(1)(B).\n\nIn our case, the defendants when questioned by the U.S. Coast Guard\n\nrefused to make a claim of nationality for the yola.\n\n             That questioning was aboard the Dominican cutter rather\n\nthan the defendants' yola and so arguably does not fit within the\n\nlanguage of section 70502(d)(1)(B)--at least if \"aboard\" is given its\n\ncommon meaning of \"on board.\"7       But neither \"aboard\" the yola, nor\n\nadjacent to it on the cutter, did any crew member make an affirmative\n\nclaim of nationality for the vessel, nor did the yola fly a flag or\n\ncarry registry papers issued by any state.            Under both the statute\n\nand international law, this is more than enough to \"include\" the yola\n\nas a vessel \"without nationality\" within the meaning of the MDLEA\n\neven if it is merely similar to and not within one of the specific\n\nexamples given in the statute.\n\n             Practically every vessel, including the legendary Flying\n\nDutchman, has links with some country; but the stateless vessel\n\n\n\n      7\n      The word can also mean \"alongside of,\" especially in nautical\ncontexts, and the defendants were arguably alongside of the yola when\nthey declined to make a claim of nationality. See Webster's Third\nNew International Dictionary of the English Language 4 (2002); The\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 5 (2d ed. unabr.\n1987).\n\n                                     -12-\n\fconcept   in    the   MDLEA   and   in   international   law   is   designed\n\nprudentially.    The controlling question is whether at the point at\n\nwhich the authorities confront the vessel, it bears the insignia or\n\npapers of a national vessel or its master is prepared to make an\n\naffirmative and sustainable claim of nationality.         To read the MDLEA\n\nmore restrictively would mean that the master and crew need only\n\ncarry no papers and jump overboard to avoid having their vessel\n\nclassed as stateless.     Cf. González, 311 F.3d at 449 (Torruella, J.,\n\nconcurring in the judgment).\n\n           The defendants are not entitled to raise a violation of\n\ninternational law as an objection, see 46 U.S.C. § 70505, but in any\n\ncase the MDLEA does not conflict with international law.                For\n\ninternational law too treats the \"stateless vessel\" concept as\n\ninformed by the need for effective enforcement.          Thus, a vessel may\n\nbe deemed \"stateless,\" and subject to the enforcement jurisdiction of\n\nany nation on the scene, if it fails to display or carry insignia of\n\nnationality and seeks to avoid national identification.         This occurs\n\n           if a \"ship\" repeatedly refuses, without\n           reasonable excuse, to reveal its allocation\n           [of nationality]. If no registration number\n           is visible and no other indicator [of\n           nationality]    can    be    discerned,    the\n           cognoscibility    is   already    demonstrably\n           insufficient, and interference will then often\n           be justifiable. . . . From the basic design\n           of [the law of sea] and from the place the\n           institution here called allocation occupies in\n           it already it may be concluded that a \"ship\"\n           which obscures the cognoscibility of its\n           allocation   repeatedly,   deliberately,   and\n           successfully may be treated as stateless.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fH. Meyers, The Nationality of Ships 322 (1967)(footnote omitted).\n\n            In sum, the instances specified by Congress--pertinently,\n\nthe refusal \"aboard\" the vessel to claim nationality, 46 U.S.C. §\n\n70502(d)(1)(B)--are not departures from international law but merely\n\npart of a pattern consistent with it; and when Congress used the word\n\n\"includes\" in listing specific instances, it allowed for reasonable\n\nextrapolation to functionally similar instances--including a refusal\n\nby the crew to claim nationality that happens to occur aboard a\n\ncutter which has the subject \"vessel\" in tow.\n\n            The MDLEA was responding to repeatedly frustrated efforts\n\nto prosecute maritime drug trafficking.            Anderson, supra note 6, at\n\n325-27 (describing enforcement history).              The statute's provisions\n\ndovetail:     a refusal to claim nationality renders the unflagged\n\nvessel   stateless    and   so    within    federal      jurisdiction,          while     a\n\nsupportable claim of nationality allows the federal authorities to\n\nseek jurisdiction by consent of the flag nation, e.g., 46 U.S.C. §\n\n70502(c)(1)(C).      Congress did not expect courts to render a cramped\n\nreading of the statute.\n\n            Accordingly,     we     need     not    decide    whether          (in      the\n\nalternative) the transfer of the crew by the Dominican Coast Guard\n\nconstituted    \"consent\"     by     the    Dominican      Republic        to     federal\n\nenforcement.    Consent     would    satisfy       the    MDLEA,     46        U.S.C.    §\n\n70502(c)(1)(C) (consent of flag state); id. § 70502(c)(1)(E) (consent\n\nof state in whose territorial waters vessel is found), and accord\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fwith international law, United States v. Robinson, 843 F.2d 1, 4 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 834 (1988).         Whether such informal\n\nconsent is enough may be an open question.      See id.\n\n            Matos, Soto and Carrasco also raise a host of other claims\n\non appeal--all requiring less discussion than the authority question.\n\nOur decision has thus far assumed that--as the jury necessarily\n\nfound--the defendants were the crew first sighted by the helicopter\n\nand seen to throw overboard bales that were recovered and found to\n\ncontain cocaine.     The defendants say that the evidence for this\n\nidentification was insufficient.\n\n            The defendants stress that the Dominican cutter that\n\nretrieved them had already intercepted and detained a second yola,\n\nwith a crew of two.     The defendants argue that the government's\n\nevidence was insufficient to prove that they were on the yola seen\n\ngathering drugs rather than on this second, innocent yola, because\n\nOfficer Young testified at trial that the three defendants \"could be\"\n\nthe same three persons that he observed from his helicopter.              The\n\nargument was preserved in a motion for acquittal, so our review is de\n\nnovo.   United States v. Potter, 463 F.3d 9, 13-14 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Nevertheless,   taking   the   evidence   in   the   light   most\n\nfavorable to the government, a rational jury could easily have found\n\nthe defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.       Although no single\n\nwitness had a continuous view of the yola from the time the boat was\n\nfirst spotted until the moment it was apprehended by the Dominican\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fcutter, there was abundant evidence from which to identify the\n\ndefendants as the crew-members and the evidence is not less powerful\n\nbecause some of it rested upon reasonable inference rather than eye-\n\nwitness identification.     See United States v. Santana-Rosa, 132 F.3d\n\n860, 866 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n             The evidence at trial included testimony from Officer\n\nYoung that the defendants' age and build matched the three persons\n\nobserved on the yola; multiple videos and photos of the yola from\n\nwhich the jury could infer the same; ion scans of cocaine residue on\n\nthe skin and clothing of the defendants;8 and testimony from the\n\nlieutenant of the Dominican cutter than the two-man yola crew and\n\nthree-man yola crew were segregated on his boat and thus unlikely to\n\nbe mixed up.\n\n             The defendants also raise two other arguments under the\n\nheading of their identification challenge but which in truth present\n\ndifferent legal questions.           First, they claim that the government\n\ndenied them a fair trial by failing to produce the only witness\n\nallegedly   in   a   position   to    settle    the    identification    issue,   a\n\nDominican   official    named   Carmelo        Matos   Rodriguez.       Government\n\ninterference in the production of witnesses helpful to the defendant\n\nmay in some circumstances preclude a fair trial, e.g., United States\n\n\n     8\n      The defendants argue on appeal that ion scans are unreliable\n\"[a]s a matter of law\" and offend due process, but they provide no\ncitation or developed argument, so the objection is waived. United\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S.\n1082 (1990).\n\n                                       -16-\n\fv. Castro, 129 F.3d 226, 232 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S.\n\n1100 (1998), but nothing like that is evident in this case.\n\n             A trial subpoena was issued at defendants' request for\n\nMatos Rodriguez on March 27, 2008, and the government apparently\n\nattempted to secure his presence at trial.                   But the defendants\n\nincorrectly identified Matos Rodriguez as a member of the \"Dominican\n\nCoast Guard\" when he was in fact with the Dominican equivalent of the\n\nDrug Enforcement Agency.        When the error was discovered and Matos\n\nRodriguez   located,    there   was   insufficient      time   to    get   him   the\n\nnecessary documents to travel to the United States.                 The defendants\n\nnever sought a continuance.\n\n             Defendants seem to claim, at least at oral argument, that\n\nthey were affirmatively misled by the government into believing that\n\nMatos Rodriguez would appear--only to be told the contrary on the\n\nfirst day of trial.        We ordered supplemental briefing from the\n\ndefendants on this specific issue after argument, instructing them to\n\n\"provide relevant transcript and record references.\"                Instead, they\n\nsubmitted   a   brief    that   relies       entirely   on     alleged     pretrial\n\nconversations and affidavits from their own employees--none of which\n\nis part of the record on appeal.         Fed. R. App. P. 10(a).\n\n             Second, defendants assail the instructions given to the\n\njury on identification during deliberations, after the jury sent a\n\nnote requesting clarification on the issue; they complain that the\n\ntrial judge alluded to hypothetical testimony by a witness who looks\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fat a lineup and says \"I think it's number two.\"     Their position is\n\nthat \"I think\" is too equivocal for proof beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nand that the instruction would have misled the jury into thinking that\n\na doubtful identification was sufficient to convict.\n\n            No objection was made to the instruction at the time it\n\nwas made, so it is reviewed only for plain error, United States v.\n\nRogers, 41 F.3d 25, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1126\n\n(1995), but on reading the instruction ourselves, we see no error at\n\nall. The court correctly instructed the jury on the types of evidence\n\nit could consider and reminded the jury--at defense counsel's request-\n\n-that identification had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNothing in the instructions suggested that a doubtful identification\n\nwas sufficient.\n\n            Next, defendants argue that the evidence was insufficient\n\nas to mens rea; they claim that--even if they were the persons on\n\nboard the yola observed retrieving the airdropped bales--there was\n\ninsufficient evidence that they knew the bales contained contraband\n\nas opposed to innocent cargo.   Again, the argument was preserved in\n\na motion for acquittal, so our review is de novo, taking all facts and\n\ninferences in the light most favorable to the government.      United\n\nStates v. Guerrero, 114 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 522\n\nU.S. 870 (1997).    But again the evidence here amply supports the\n\nverdict and is well within our precedents.\n\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f            The defendants' yola was seen idling in the drop site\n\nbefore collecting the bales, cf. Guerrero, 114 F.3d at 343; the yola\n\nlacked fishing equipment, despite defendants' claim at trial to have\n\nbeen out fishing; the defendants jettisoned the bales and fled at the\n\nfirst sign of the Coast Guard, cf. United States v. Piedrahita-\n\nSantiago, 931 F.2d 127, 131 (1st Cir. 1991); and the defendants and\n\ntheir clothing showed traces of the drug.      Nor is it common for\n\nvaluable cargo to be entrusted to persons unaware of its contents.\n\nUnited States v. Angulo-Hernández, 565 F.3d 2, 8 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 130 S. Ct. 776 (2009).\n\n            Finally, at sentencing, defendants sought a reduction in\n\nthe calculation of their offense level because they       were minor\n\nparticipants in the crime, U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b) (2008)--an argument\n\nrejected by the sentencing judge--as well as a reduction under United\n\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), and its progeny.    They never\n\nclearly articulated then or now why a sentence within the guidelines\n\nrange would be unreasonable or unjust (except that it was long);\n\ninstead, they argue on appeal that the sentencing judge failed to\n\nunderstand his discretion to depart downwards under Booker.\n\n            At one point, the sentencing judge stated that \"[t]here is\n\nnothing before the Court that would allow [it] to make any meaningful\n\nexercise of any additional sentencing factor under [18 U.S.C. §]\n\n3553(a), because nothing of the sort has been argued.\"    In context,\n\nwe see no indication that the judge misunderstood his authority;\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\frather he simply thought that the defendants had offered no persuasive\n\nreason for a lower sentence.   The latter judgment was his to make.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f                             APPENDIX\n\n46 U.S.C. § 70502(c) (2006) states in full:\n\n (c) Vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.--\n (1) In general.--In this chapter, the term “vessel subject to the\n jurisdiction of the United States” includes--\n (A) a vessel without nationality;\n (B) a vessel assimilated to a vessel without nationality under\n paragraph (2) of article 6 of the 1958 Convention on the High\n Seas;\n (C) a vessel registered in a foreign nation if that nation has\n consented or waived objection to the enforcement of United States\n law by the United States;\n (D) a vessel in the customs waters of the United States;\n (E) a vessel in the territorial waters of a foreign nation if the\n nation consents to the enforcement of United States law by the\n United States; and\n (F) a vessel in the contiguous zone of the United States, as\n defined in Presidential Proclamation 7219 of September 2, 1999 (43\n U.S.C. 1331 note), that--\n (i) is entering the United States;\n (ii) has departed the United States; or\n (iii) is a hovering vessel as defined in section 401 of the Tariff\n Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401).\n (2) Consent or waiver of objection.--Consent or waiver of\n objection by a foreign nation to the enforcement of United States\n law by the United States under paragraph (1)(C) or (E)--\n (A) may be obtained by radio, telephone, or similar oral or\n electronic means; and\n (B) is proved conclusively by certification of the Secretary of\n State or the Secretary's designee.\n\n\n\n                   -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f              LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.        The Maritime Drug Law\n\nEnforcement Act (MDLEA) makes it            unlawful for an individual to\n\n\"knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or possess with\n\nintent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance on board\n\n(1) a vessel of the United States or a vessel subject to the\n\njurisdiction of the United States; or (2) any vessel if the individual\n\nis a citizen of the United States or a resident alien of the United\n\nStates.\"     46 U.S.C. § 70503(a).   The majority, after concluding that\n\nthe government need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\na vessel is \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" holds\n\nthat the government met its burden in this case because it established\n\nthat   the   defendants'   small   fishing    boat   was   a   \"vessel   without\n\nnationality\" within the meaning of the statute.            See id. § 70502(c)\n\n(defining \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\"\n\nto include \"a vessel without nationality\").           I disagree with both of\n\nthose conclusions.     Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                      I.\n\n              The MDLEA was one of a series of steps Congress took in\n\nthe 1980s and 1990s to extend the reach of the federal drug laws\n\nbeyond the territory of the United States.           Because the function and\n\nmeaning of the critical phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States\" is not self-evident, it is important to understand the\n\nMDLEA's design and background.        I therefore begin by reviewing the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\flegislative context giving rise to the statute and its jurisdictional\n\nrequirement.\n\nA.   Marijuana on the High Seas Act\n\n             Before     1980,   maritime     drug   smugglers     outside    the\n\nterritorial waters of the United States generally had to be prosecuted\n\nfor conspiracy to import drugs into the United States.              That regime\n\nproved to be unsatisfactory, primarily because of the difficulty of\n\nproving an intent to import.     The problem was not that the Coast Guard\n\nlacked the authority to interdict drug smugglers and seize contraband;\n\nto the contrary, the Coast Guard has long enjoyed \"'one of the most\n\nsweeping grants of police authority ever to be written into U.S.\n\nlaw.'\"   Note, High on the Seas: Drug Smuggling, the Fourth Amendment,\n\nand Warrantless Searches at Sea, 93 Harv. L. Rev. 725, 726 (1980)\n\n(quoting Stephen H. Evans, The United States Coast Guard 1790-1915 218\n\n(1949));    see   14   U.S.C.   § 89(a)     (setting   forth     Coast   Guard's\n\nenforcement authority).     Rather, the problem derived from the limited\n\nsubstantive scope of the maritime drug laws: \"in most cases the Coast\n\nGuard [was] able to seize and confiscate the ship and the illegal\n\ndrugs, but the government [was] not able to prosecute the crew or\n\nothers involved in the smuggling operation.\"           S. Rep. No. 96-855, at\n\n2 (1980).\n\n             Congress    responded   to     the   problem   by    enacting   the\n\nMarijuana on the High Seas Act, Pub. L. No. 96-350, 94 Stat. 1159\n\n(1980), which broadened the drug laws in a number of ways.                   Most\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fimportantly, the statute made it a crime for certain individuals on\n\nthe high seas to possess drugs with the intent to distribute, which\n\nobviated the need to prove that the drugs were destined for the United\n\nStates and opened the door for a much broader extraterritorial\n\napplication of the federal drug laws.                 See 125 Cong. Rec. 20,083\n\n(1979) (statement of Rep. Paul McCloskey) (\"Where current law requires\n\nan intent to import a controlled substance into the United States as\n\na necessary element of the crime[,] this bill essentially requires\n\nonly knowledge or intent to distribute with no need to establish a\n\nU.S. destination.         Such intent may be inferred from the presence of\n\ncontrolled substances that exceed normal consumption –- and that are\n\nnot entered as cargo on a vessel's manifest.\").\n\n                 The majority is correct that the Marijuana on the High\n\nSeas Act and its successor statutes manifest an intent to reach\n\nbroadly.      Congress was concerned about maritime drug trafficking and\n\nsought to \"give the Justice Department the maximum prosecutorial\n\nauthority permitted under international law.\"              S. Rep. 96-855, at 2;\n\nsee    also   125    Cong.   Rec.   20,083   (1979)    (statement   of   Rep.   Paul\n\nMcCloskey) (stating that the bill authorizes prosecution \"to the\n\nbroadest extent possible under international law\").                 As the quoted\n\nlegislative history makes clear, however, Congress also intended to\n\nstay    within      the   boundaries   of    international   law,   which   places\n\nlimitations on a nation's power \"to make its law applicable to the\n\nactivities, relations, or status of persons.\"             Restatement (Third) of\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\fForeign Relations Law of the United States § 401(a) (1987).                    Those\n\nlimitations,     referred      to   under      the    heading     \"jurisdiction     to\n\nprescribe,\" have traditionally permitted nations to legislate with\n\nrespect to (1) their own nationals; (2) acts committed within, or\n\nhaving substantial effects within, their territory; and (3) acts\n\ndirected at their national security.9            Id. § 402.\n\n            On    the   high    seas,    there       is   an   additional   basis   of\n\njurisdiction to prescribe: vessel nationality.10 Vessels, like people,\n\nare capable of having nationality, and a vessel on the high seas (and\n\nthose aboard it) may be subjected to the laws of the country whose\n\nnationality she bears.         See id. § 502(2).           A Canadian vessel, for\n\nexample, may properly be subjected to the laws of Canada.                   The high\n\nseas legal regime depends upon vessels having one, and only one,\n\nnationality.     Vessels without any nationality at all (also referred\n\nto as stateless vessels) are subject to the prescriptive jurisdiction\n\n\n\n      9\n       Nations may also prescribe law with respect to a narrow class\nof universally condemned activities, such as piracy.     Restatement\n(Third) § 404.\n      10\n       A number of sources say that vessel nationality provides the\nexclusive basis for exercising prescriptive jurisdiction over a\nvessel on the high seas. See Convention on the High Seas art. 6,\nApr. 29, 1958, 13 U.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82; McCulloch v. Sociedad\nNacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U.S. 10, 21 (1963); R.R.\nChurchill & A.V. Lowe, The Law of the Sea 208 (3d ed. 1999).\nHowever, Congress, in enacting the Marijuana on the High Seas Act,\napparently viewed vessel nationality as a supplement to the\ntraditional bases of prescriptive jurisdiction.      The Restatement\nconcurs in that view. See Restatement (Third) § 402 reporters' note\n4 (characterizing vessel nationality as \"an addition to the general\nbases of jurisdiction set forth in this section\").\n\n                                        -25-\n\fof every nation.      See United States v. Victoria, 876 F.2d 1009, 1010-\n\n11 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v. Marino-Garcia, 679 F.2d 1373,\n\n1380-83 (11th Cir. 1982).\n\n               Although the settled bases of prescriptive jurisdiction\n\nare broad, they are not limitless.            A country must be able to point\n\nto one of those bases when extending its penal laws to an individual.\n\nIf Congress had made it a federal crime for any person to possess\n\ndrugs on board any vessel anywhere, it would have run afoul of the\n\ninternational legal limitations on its jurisdiction to prescribe.11\n\nCongress therefore limited the reach of the Marijuana on the High Seas\n\nAct   to    five   categories   of   persons:     (1) United   States   citizens,\n\n(2) individuals on board a vessel within the customs waters of the\n\nUnited States, (3) individuals intending to import drugs into United\n\nStates territory or who know drugs will be imported into the United\n\nStates,     (4) individuals     on   board    a   vessel    with   United   States\n\nnationality, and (5) individuals on board a           U.S. vessel or a \"vessel\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States on the high seas,\"\n\nwhich was defined to include a \"vessel without nationality or a vessel\n\nassimilated to a vessel without nationality.\"              Pub. L. No. 96-350, 94\n\n\n       11\n       Although Congress could enact criminal laws that go beyond the\nlimitations of international law, see, e.g., Curtis A. Bradley,\nUniversal Jurisdiction and U.S. Law, 2001 U. Chi. Legal F. 323, 331\n(2001), its intention at the time, as indicated above, apparently was\nto stay within those limits. Cf. United States v. Hensel, 699 F.2d\n18, 27 (1st Cir. 1983) (\"Congress wished to authorize the search of\nvessels on the high seas to the extent such searches conformed to\ninternational law, but there is no indication that it wished to go\nfurther.\").\n\n                                       -26-\n\fStat. 1159.        Each of those categories corresponds to one of the\n\ntraditional    bases       for    exercising           prescriptive          jurisdiction --\n\nnationality of the defendant, territoriality, national security,\n\nnationality of the vessel, and statelessness.                   See H.R. Rep. No. 96-\n\n323, at 10-11 (1979).            The point made explicit in the legislative\n\nhistory is thus apparent from the text of the statute as well:\n\nCongress intended to extend the maritime drug laws to what it viewed\n\nas the limits provided by international law, but no further.12\n\nB.    Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act\n\n              By 1986, Congress had become convinced that the Marijuana\n\non the High Seas Act was in need of revision.                      In Congress's view,\n\n\"defendants in cases involving foreign or stateless vessel boardings\n\nand    seizures     [had]        been        relying     heavily        on    international\n\njurisdictional       questions          as     legal     technicalities          to    escape\n\nconviction.\"      S. Rep. No. 99-530, at 15 (1986).                Congress enacted the\n\nMaritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, Pub. L. 99-640, § 17, 100 Stat.\n\n3545 (1986), with a view toward further expanding and strengthening\n\nthe maritime drug laws. Its approach was measured, however. Although\n\nCongress extended the statute's coverage to several new categories of\n\ndefendants    --    most   notably,          to   individuals      on    board    \"a   vessel\n\nregistered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or\n\n\n       12\n          Other statutes criminalizing extraterritorial conduct have\nfollowed a similar approach. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2237 (failure to\nheave to, obstruction of boarding, providing false information); id.\n§ 2339B (providing material support to designated foreign terrorist\norganizations); id. § 2339C (financing terrorism).\n\n                                              -27-\n\fwaived objection to the enforcement of United States law by the United\n\nStates\"13 -- it otherwise retained the pre-existing restrictions on the\n\nstatute's substantive scope.      Id.      Congress also added a provision\n\npartially defining the phrase \"vessel without nationality,\" which had\n\nbeen left undefined in the original statute.14\n\nC.   1996 Amendments\n\n            Congress amended the MDLEA again in 1996. See Coast Guard\n\nAuthorization Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-324, § 1138, 110 Stat.\n\n3901, 3988-89 (1996).      The intent, as before, was to \"expand the\n\nGovernment's prosecutorial effectiveness in drug smuggling cases.\"\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 104-854, at 142 (1996) (Conf. Rep.).           To that end,\n\nCongress   further     expanded   the   definition   of   \"vessel   without\n\nnationality,\"   Pub. L. No. 104-324, § 1138(a)(1),15 added provisions\n\n\n      13\n          Consent is a well-established basis of jurisdiction to\nprescribe under international law. See United States v. Robinson,\n843 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1988).\n      14\n        The statute provided that a \"vessel without nationality\"\nincludes:\n\n      (A) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge\n      makes a claim of registry, which claim is denied by the\n      flag nation whose registry is claimed; and\n      (B) any vessel aboard which the master or person in charge\n      fails, upon request of an officer of the United States\n      empowered to enforce applicable provisions of United States\n      law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that\n      vessel.\n\nPub. L. No. 99-640, 100 Stat. 3545.\n      15\n       The new provision added to the definition \"a vessel aboard\nwhich the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and\nthe claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and\n\n                                    -28-\n\fmaking it easier for the government to prove that a foreign nation\n\nconsented to the prosecution, id. § 1138(a)(2)-(3), and declared that\n\nMDLEA defendants \"shall not have standing to raise the claim of\n\nfailure to comply with international law as a basis for a defense,\"\n\nid. § 1138(a)(4). Congress also enacted an unusual provision that has\n\nassumed importance in this case:\n\n                Jurisdiction of the United States with\n                respect to vessels subject to this chapter is\n                not   an   element  of   any   offense.   All\n                jurisdictional issues arising under this\n                chapter are preliminary questions of law to\n                be determined solely by the trial judge.\n\nId. § 1138(a)(5).         Otherwise, the amendments left the substantive\n\nlimitations on the MDLEA's scope unaltered.\n\n                With this background in mind, I turn to the majority's\n\nanalysis.\n\n                                       II.\n\n                 The majority holds, as a threshold matter, that the\n\ngovernment's proof that the defendants' vessel is covered by the MDLEA\n\nmust be by a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.         I do not agree.        Like the majority, I do not\n\nbelieve   the    burden   of   proof   affects    the   outcome   of   this   case.\n\nNevertheless, I wish to respond to the majority's analysis.\n\n                Prior to the 1996 amendments to the MDLEA, vessel status\n\nhad to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.                See, e.g.,\n\n\n\nunequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.\"\n\n                                       -29-\n\fUnited States v. Guerrero, 114 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir. 1997).16                 The\n\n1996 amendments expressly removed the vessel status issue from the\n\njury's consideration. See 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a).          They did not address\n\nthe standard of proof, however.           I would presume, in the absence of\n\nany textual indication to the contrary, that Congress did not intend\n\nto silently alter the longstanding rule that vessel status must be\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.          See United States v. O'Brien, 130\n\nS. Ct. 2169, 2178 (2010) (\"Congress does not enact substantive changes\n\nsub silentio.\").\n\n                The majority offers several justifications for reading an\n\nimplied shift in the standard of proof into the 1996 amendments.\n\nFirst,     it   says   that   Congress   intended   vessel   status   to   be    \"a\n\npreliminary issue, like venue and other judge-determined issues\" that\n\nare commonly proved by a preponderance of the evidence.          See 46 U.S.C.\n\n§ 70504(a) (characterizing \"[j]urisdiction,\" i.e., vessel status, as\n\na \"preliminary question[] of law\"). But that rationale is in conflict\n\nwith our decision in United States v. González, 311 F.3d 440 (1st Cir.\n\n2002), where we held that vessel status goes to \"the substantive reach\n\nof the statute – applying to some vessels but not others\" – rather\n\n\n\n      16\n          Our court was not alone in that interpretation. \"Prior to\n1996, there was a consensus among the circuits that 'the\njurisdictional requirement . . . is an element of the crime charged\nand therefore must be decided by the jury.'\"       United States v.\nMoreno-Morillo, 334 F.3d 819, 828 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting United\nStates v. Medjuck, 48 F.3d 1107, 1110 (9th Cir. 1995)); see also\nUnited States v. Bustos-Useche, 273 F.3d 622, 626 (5th Cir. 2001);\nUnited States v. Medina, 90 F.3d 459, 464 (11th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                         -30-\n\fthan to the threshold issue of the court's authority to hear the case.\n\nId. at 443 (emphasis omitted).   Unlike venue and the other procedural\n\nand evidentiary matters mentioned by the majority, a failure to prove\n\nthat defendants' conduct occurred on board a covered vessel amounts\n\nto a failure to prove that the defendants violated the MDLEA. Compare\n\nid. (\"Congress asserted its own authority to regulate drug trafficking\n\non some ships but not all ships and, in this context, used the word\n\n'jurisdiction' loosely to describe its own assertion of authority to\n\nregulate; it does the same thing whenever it fixes an 'affects\n\ninterstate commerce' or 'involved a federally insured bank' as a\n\ncondition of the crime.\"), with Am. Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U.S.\n\n443, 453 (1994) (\"[V]enue is a matter that goes to process rather than\n\nsubstantive rights – determining which among various competent courts\n\nwill decide the case.\").17\n\n            It is equally unhelpful to suggest, as the majority does,\n\nthat Congress's allocation of decision-making authority to the judge\n\nnecessarily implies a shift in the standard of proof because \"jury\n\nfact-finding and the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard generally go\n\nhand in hand.\"   Although the two issues often go hand in hand, they\n\nare not invariably linked.   Venue, for instance, is established by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence but must be submitted to the jury when\n\n\n      17\n        Although vessel status is a substantive issue in that it\nrelates to \"the reach and application\" of the statute, González, 311\nF.3d at 443, it is not an element of the offense. See 46 U.S.C. §\n70504(a); United States v. Vilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 20 (1st\nCir. 2008).\n\n                                 -31-\n\fput in issue.            See United States v. Jackalow, 66 U.S. 484, 487-88\n\n(1861); United States v. Perez, 280 F.3d 318, 330, 333-34 (3d Cir.\n\n2002).      Conversely, petty offenses are tried to the court but subject\n\nto the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.                           See United States v.\n\nMcFarland,         445    F.3d     29,       30-31    (1st    Cir.    2006).18        Even   in\n\nconstitutional law, the judge/jury issue can be separated from the\n\nstandard      of    proof        issue.        For     example,    there    is   no    federal\n\nconstitutional           right    to     a    jury    trial   in     juvenile    delinquency\n\nproceedings, see McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 547 (1971),\n\nyet the charges in such proceedings must nevertheless be proved beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, see In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970).                             As\n\nthese authorities indicate, Congress's decision to \"remove from the\n\njury   and    confide       to    the     judge\"     the   question    of   vessel     status,\n\nGonzález, 311 F.3d at 443, does not necessarily imply that Congress\n\nintended to lower the government's burden of proof as well.                            The two\n\nissues, though \"interrelated,\" Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275,\n\n278 (1993), are ultimately separate.\n\n                Finally, the majority says that the preponderance of the\n\nevidence      standard       \"comports         with     Congress'     aim   to    facilitate\n\n\n       18\n           Other judge-determined issues are subject to higher and\nlower standards of proof. See, e.g., Huddleston v. United States,\n485 U.S. 681, 690 (1988) (noting that a court resolves a question of\nrelevancy conditioned on fact by deciding \"whether the jury could\nreasonably    find  the  conditional   fact\");   United   States   v.\nRuiz-Gaxiola, No. 08-10378, 2010 WL 3720211, at *5 (9th Cir. Sep. 24,\n2010) (holding that facts justifying forced administration of\nantipsychotic medication must be established by clear and convincing\nevidence).\n\n                                                -32-\n\fenforcement.\"       But, of course, the same could be said of every issue\n\nin   a   criminal    case.   Congress    always    and   understandably   wants\n\ncriminals to be brought to justice.         That fact is not a license to\n\ninterpret every criminal statute as broadly as possible.          Congress is\n\nalso mindful of individual rights, international law, and the need for\n\nsubstantive and procedural limitations on the federal criminal power.\n\nThe question in this case, as in every case, is where Congress struck\n\nthe balance between those considerations and the desire to punish\n\nwrongdoers.    The majority's unelaborated reference to Congress's \"aim\n\nto facilitate enforcement\" does not meaningfully advance that inquiry.\n\nTo the contrary, it tends to obscure the nuanced approach that\n\nCongress took in the statute.           Cf. Bd. of Governors of the Fed.\n\nReserve Sys. v.        Dimension Fin. Corp., 474 U.S. 361, 374 (1986)\n\n(\"Invocation of the 'plain purpose' of legislation at the expense of\n\nthe terms of the statute itself takes no account of the processes of\n\ncompromise and, in the end, prevents the effectuation of congressional\n\nintent.\").\n\n              Hence, in my view, Congress's silence is evidence that it\n\ndid not intend to alter the standard of proof.\n\n                                    III.\n\n              Even assuming that preponderance of the evidence is the\n\ncorrect standard, the government did not meet that standard in this\n\ncase.    It was the government's burden to prove that the defendants'\n\nyola was a \"vessel without nationality.\"          That statutory phrase dates\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\fto the original Marijuana on the High Seas Act, which left the term\n\nundefined.   It was evidently meant to refer to vessels that would be\n\nconsidered stateless under international law.   Congress subsequently\n\nadded three specific examples of \"vessel[s] without nationality\" to\n\nthe statute.    See 46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1) (quoted infra).    As the\n\nmajority correctly holds, Congress did not intend those three examples\n\nto be exhaustive.   The MDLEA extends to vessels that are considered\n\nstateless under international law, even if those vessels do not fall\n\nwithin one of the specifically enumerated categories.19    See United\n\nStates v. Rosero, 42 F.3d 166, 171 (3d Cir. 1994) (Alito, J.).\n\n             International law, in turn, largely leaves the allocation\n\nof vessel nationality to national law.    Each country \"may determine\n\nfor itself the conditions on which it will grant its nationality to\n\na merchant ship, thereby accepting responsibility for it and acquiring\n\nauthority over it.\"20   Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U.S. 571, 584 (1953);\n\n\n      19\n          The MDLEA provides that \"[a] failure to comply with\ninternational law does not divest a court of jurisdiction and is not\na defense to a proceeding under this chapter.\" 46 U.S.C. § 70505.\nThat provision simply means that international law does not supply an\nindependent basis for defending against an MDLEA prosecution. To the\nextent that international law informs the scope of the statute\nitself, it must necessarily be considered in determining whether a\ndefendant's conduct falls within the statute. Cf. United States v.\nAlvarez-Machain, 504 U.S. 655, 666 (1992) (distinguishing between the\ninvocation of international law as \"an independent basis for the\nright respondent asserts not to be tried in the United States\" and\nthe invocation of international law to \"inform the interpretation of\nthe Treaty terms\").\n      20\n          A vessel that has been granted the nationality of a\nparticular country is often said to sail \"under the flag\" of that\ncountry (the \"flag state\") or to be entitled to \"fly the flag\" of\n\n                                 -34-\n\fsee also Purchase of Ships of Belligerents by Neutrals, 6 Op. Att'y\n\nGen. 638, 640 (1854) (\"The law of nations and common sense combine to\n\nrequire   that     every   ship    shall    have        a    nationality,     defined      and\n\nevidenced     in   each    case   according       to        the   municipal    law    of   the\n\nparticular nation to which the ship appertains.\").\n\n               In some countries, the law provides that any ship meeting\n\ncertain conditions (e.g., ownership by a national) is considered a\n\nnational ship.      See H. Meyers, The Nationality of Ships 147 (1967).\n\nIn    other   countries,     nationality          must       be    bestowed    through       an\n\naffirmative act of the government.                Id.       Still other countries link\n\nnationality to registration, granting their nationality automatically\n\nto ships that are registered in accordance with the law.                            Id.    Many\n\ncountries, including the United States, combine elements of the\n\ndifferent systems.          See 46 U.S.C. § 70502(b);                    Ted L. McDorman,\n\nStateless Fishing Vessels, International Law and the U.N. High Seas\n\nFisheries Conference, 25 J. Mar. L. & Comm. 531, 533 (1994) (\"Practice\n\nin the United States suggests that where a vessel is not registered,\n\nthe   nationality    of    the    vessel    can    become         that   of   the    vessel's\n\nowner.\"); The Chiquita, 19 F.2d 417, 418 (5th Cir. 1927) (\"If [a\n\nvessel] is not properly registered, her nationality is still that of\n\nher owner.\").\n\n\n\nthat country. See, e.g., Convention on the High Seas art. 5, Apr.\n29, 1958, 13 U.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82. To prevent confusion with\nthe national flag that is often flown from the stern of a ship, I\navoid those metaphors in favor of the term \"nationality.\"\n\n                                           -35-\n\f               A vessel either has a given nationality or it does not.\n\nIt is therefore incorrect to suggest, as the majority does, that\n\nwhether a vessel is stateless depends upon the circumstances in which\n\nit is encountered.          See Majority Opinion at 13 (\"The controlling\n\nquestion is whether at the point at which the authorities confront the\n\nvessel, it bears the insignia or papers of a national vessel or its\n\nmaster is prepared to make an affirmative and sustainable claim of\n\nnationality.\" (emphasis added)). Under international law, a stateless\n\nvessel is simply one that does not have a valid grant of nationality\n\nfrom any country.      See Rosero, 42 F.3d at 171.               That may be the case\n\nif, for example, no country has ever granted the vessel nationality;\n\nif a country has canceled its grant of nationality; or if the\n\npolitical     entity   that       granted    the    vessel   nationality       is    not   a\n\nrecognized international person.              Id.\n\n               Because statelessness is the absence of nationality, the\n\ntask of establishing that a vessel is genuinely stateless can \"present\n\nthe difficulties often associated with proving a negative.\"                         Rosero,\n\n42 F.3d at 171.         International law deals with this problem by\n\npermitting nations to deem a vessel that \"repeatedly, deliberately,\n\nand   successfully\"     obscures        its        nationality    to     be   stateless,\n\nirrespective of whether the vessel is genuinely stateless.                          Meyers,\n\nsupra,   at   322.     In     a    similar    vein,    a   vessel      that   claims   the\n\nnationality of two or more countries according to convenience is\n\n\"assimilated to\" (in the sense of \"rendered similar to\" or \"deemed to\n\n\n                                            -36-\n\fbe\") a vessel without nationality, even if it legitimately possesses\n\na nationality.     Convention on the High Seas art. 6(2).    These rules\n\noperate as sanctions, effectively penalizing vessels that attempt to\n\nevade law enforcement authority on the high seas.\n\n            Congress took this notion of \"deemed\" statelessness a step\n\nfurther in the MDLEA.    Under the statute, three additional categories\n\nof vessels that make false or evasive claims of nationality are deemed\n\nto be stateless:\n\n            (A)      a vessel aboard which the master or\n                     individual in charge makes a claim of\n                     registry that is denied by the nation\n                     whose registry is claimed;\n\n            (B)      a vessel aboard which the master or\n                     individual in charge fails, on request of\n                     an   officer   of   the   United   States\n                     authorized    to    enforce    applicable\n                     provisions of United States law, to make\n                     a claim of nationality or registry for\n                     that vessel; and\n\n            (C)      a vessel aboard which the master or\n                     individual in charge makes a claim of\n                     registry and for which the claimed nation\n                     of registry does not affirmatively and\n                     unequivocally assert that the vessel is\n                     of its nationality.\n\n46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1).\n\n            To summarize, international law and the MDLEA recognize\n\ntwo basic categories of vessels without nationality.        In the first\n\ncategory are vessels that are genuinely stateless under international\n\nlaw, in the sense that they do not have a valid grant of nationality\n\nfrom any country.    In the second category are vessels that are deemed\n\n\n                                  -37-\n\fto   be    stateless    because     they    have      attempted    to   obscure   their\n\nnationality.      I will discuss each of these categories in explaining\n\nwhy I do not believe the government carried its burden of proving that\n\nthe defendants' yola fell within the scope of the MDLEA.\n\nA.   Genuine Statelessness\n\n                The    government      argues     that   the   yola     was   genuinely\n\nstateless because the defendants \"were not flying a flag, carried no\n\ndocumentation, and never claimed to the Coast Guard that their ship\n\nwas registered in the Dominican Republic or flew a Dominican flag.\"\n\nInsofar as the government means to suggest that any vessel that fails\n\nto affirmatively signal its nationality through a flag, documents, or\n\nan oral claim of registry becomes stateless under international law,\n\nit is mistaken.            Registration,      documentation, and the flag are\n\n\"indicators\" of vessel nationality, but they are not sources of vessel\n\nnationality.      See Meyers, supra, at 138-140; see also Lauritzen, 345\n\nU.S. at 584 (\"Nationality is evidenced to the world by the ship's\n\npapers and its flag.\" (emphasis added)); The Mohawk, 70 U.S. 566, 571\n\n(1865) (\"The purpose of a register is to declare the nationality of\n\na vessel engaged in trade with foreign nations, and to enable her to\n\nassert that nationality wherever found.\"); Henry Wheaton, Elements of\n\nInternational Law 425 n.163 (Richard Henry Dana, Jr., ed., 8th ed.\n\n1866) (distinguishing between a vessel's \"ostensible nationality,\"\n\nwhich     is   indicated    by   its   flag     and   documents,    and   its   \"actual\n\n\n\n\n                                           -38-\n\fnationality, which depends on the domicile of the owner and other\n\nfacts\").\n\n             Under international law, \"[a] vessel may be considered as\n\npossessing the nationality of a State even though she is unregistered,\n\npossesses no documents evidencing that nationality, nor even flies the\n\nflag of that State.\"21    N.P. Ready, Ship Registration 3 (3d ed. 1998);\n\nsee   also    McDorman,     supra,     at   533   (\"Determining   vessel\n\nnationality . . . is not just a question of documentation of the\n\nvessel[,] and a vessel literally without a flag, not being a vessel\n\nregistered in a country, is not necessarily stateless or without\n\nnationality.\"); Rosero, 42 F.3d at 172-73 (holding that it was error\n\nto instruct the jury that it could find a vessel genuinely stateless\n\n\"based on an unstructured weighing of the totality of the evidence,\"\n\nincluding various indicators of nationality).         Even pirate ships\n\npossessing   no documents and flying the flag of an unrecognized\n\ninsurrectionary movement do not necessarily lose their nationality.\n\nSee Convention on the High Seas art. 18 (\"A ship or aircraft may\n\nretain its nationality although it has become a pirate ship or\n\naircraft. The retention or loss of nationality is determined by the\n\nlaw of the State from which such nationality was derived.\"); United\n\n\n\n      21\n          One commentator colorfully illustrates this principle:\n\"According to international law the flying of the national flag was\nnever the cause of -- or the condition for -- [nationality]. When\nthe last bunting on board was blown to tatters, this never had\nradical legal consequences, nor had the hoisting of the flag.\"\nMeyers, supra, at 162.\n\n                                     -39-\n\fNations Convention on the Law of the Sea art. 104, Dec. 10, 1982, S.\n\nTreaty Doc. No. 103-39, 1833 U.N.T.S. 3 (same). The question in every\n\ncase turns on national law.\n\n              There is a separate question of whether the absence of a\n\nflag and documentation, though not directly affecting a vessel's\n\nnationality, can provide circumstantial evidence of statelessness.\n\nI believe it can.        Common sense suggests that a vessel that lacks the\n\nusual indicators of nationality is more likely to be stateless than\n\nan equivalently situated vessel possessing such indicators.                    Cf. Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 401.      But even acknowledging that to be so, it does not mean\n\nthat proof that a vessel lacks the usual indicators of nationality is\n\nalone sufficient to justify the inferential conclusion that the vessel\n\nis, in fact, stateless.          The reasonableness of such a conclusion will\n\ndepend on other factors that are particular to each case.\n\n              It    is     not    necessary      to    enumerate       those    factors\n\ncomprehensively to see that such an inference is not warranted here.\n\nThe yola in question was a small wooden boat equipped with an outboard\n\nmotor.   It undisputedly originated in the Dominican Republic and was\n\ncarrying    Dominican     crew     members.      It    was   sighted    just    outside\n\nDominican    territorial         waters   (within      the   Dominican     Republic's\n\nExclusive Economic Zone) and was obviously incapable of making long\n\ninternational      voyages.        Although      the   vessel   was     not    carrying\n\ndocumentation, \"[m]any states . . . do not issue documents to ships\n\nwith a tonnage below a given figure.\"            Meyers, supra, at 160; see also\n\n\n                                          -40-\n\fR.R. Churchill & A.V. Lowe, The Law of the Sea 213 n.19 (3d ed. 1999)\n\n(noting that \"a State may not require, or permit, the registration of\n\nships below a certain size, for example, but may nonetheless regard\n\nsuch ships as having its nationality if they are owned by its\n\nnationals\").    Defendant Soto-Pérez testified at trial that the yola\n\nwas owned by a Dominican man and was registered in some fashion with\n\nthe Dominican government.\n\n              All of this evidence points strongly toward Dominican\n\nnationality.    The government, which bore the burden of proving that\n\nthe yola was stateless, offered nothing to rebut or undermine that\n\nconclusion.    It submitted no evidence regarding Dominican law on\n\nnationality, presented no statement from a Dominican official, and\n\ngenerally made no attempt to eliminate the Dominican Republic as the\n\nmost plausible candidate for nationality.     Nor did the government\n\nobtain the Dominican Republic's consent to prosecution, see 46 U.S.C.\n\n§ 70502(c)(1)(C), which could have provided a fallback position in the\n\nevent that the evidence of statelessness proved deficient.22      The\n\ndistrict court, for its part, appears to have shifted the burden of\n\nproof to the defendants.      At one point, the judge told defense\n\ncounsel: \"You could have brought the owner of the boat to testify.\n\nYou could have done that.    He would have told you yes, this was my\n\n\n      22\n          The majority's suggestion that the transfer of the crew by\nthe Dominican Coast Guard may have constituted informal consent is\ninteresting, but it is not an appropriate basis for affirming the\njudgment in this case. Consent was not charged in the indictment,\nargued below, or raised on appeal.\n\n                                 -41-\n\fboat.    I bought it.    I have pictures of the boat.             Here they are.     I\n\nhave it registered.      Brought certified papers of the registry.               All\n\nthose things could have been done.\"            Needless to say, it was not the\n\ndefendants' burden to prove that their boat fell outside the scope of\n\nthe statute.\n\n              Given all the circumstances, I believe it was erroneous\n\nfor the district court to conclude, based solely on the lack of a flag\n\nand     documentation,   that    the       defendants'   vessel     was   genuinely\n\nstateless.     Those factors would almost certainly have justified the\n\ndetention    and   boarding     of   the    yola,   which   may    be   based   on   a\n\n\"reasonable suspicion\" that a vessel is stateless.23 See United States\n\nv. Williams, 617 F.2d 1063, 1082 (5th Cir. 1980) (en banc); Proposed\n\nInterdiction of Haitian Flag Vessels, 5 Op. O.L.C. 242, 243 n.4 (1981)\n\n(\"Ships flying no flag may also be stopped to determine if they are\n\nstateless.\").      But the question of whether there are reasonable\n\ngrounds for detaining and searching a vessel is \"separate\" from the\n\nquestion of whether the vessel is truly stateless and, as such, falls\n\nwithin the ambit of the MDLEA.         United States v. Potes, 880 F.2d 1475,\n\n\n\n\n        23\n          As it happens, the Dominican Republic has given the United\nStates blanket authorization to board and search any Dominican vessel\non the high seas \"suspected of illicit traffic\" in drugs.

Rep., art. 10, Mar. 23, 1995, T.I.A.S. No.\n12620. However, the Dominican Republic has retained the \"primary\nright\" to prosecute the individuals on board such a vessel. Id. art.\n11.\n\n                                        -42-\n\f1478 (1st Cir. 1989).           On the facts of this case, I do not believe the\n\ngovernment satisfied its burden of proving the latter.\n\nB.   Deemed Statelessness\n\n                  The question, then, is whether the yola can be deemed to\n\nbe stateless. The majority concludes that it can. My colleagues rely\n\nprimarily on the provision extending the MDLEA to \"a vessel aboard\n\nwhich the master or individual in charge fails, on request of an\n\nofficer      of   the    United    States     authorized    to    enforce       applicable\n\nprovisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or\n\nregistry for that vessel.\"             46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1)(B).24              Pursuant\n\nto the text of that provision, the failure to claim nationality has\n\nlegal consequences only in specific circumstances: when a specified\n\nindividual aboard the vessel fails to respond to a federal law\n\nenforcement officer's request for a claim of nationality.\n\n                  Here, however, no federal officer requested the yola's\n\nnationality while the defendants were still on board the vessel.\n\nOfficer Young questioned the defendants after they were picked up by\n\nthe Dominican Coast Guard.             Among other things, he asked \"if anybody\n\nwould    like     to    speak    for   the   boat   and    give   [him]     a    claim   of\n\nnationality.\"          The defendants \"shook their heads no, and actually did\n\n\n\n        24\n       The majority also suggests that the defendants' failure to\nmake an \"affirmative claim of nationality\" is on its own enough to\nbring them within the scope of the MDLEA. That suggestion finds no\nsupport in the statute, which addresses the failure to claim\nnationality in a separate section that is inapplicable here. See 46\nU.S.C. § 70502(b)(2)(B).\n\n                                             -43-\n\fnot give [him] a full response.\"25         I will assume that this exchange\n\nwould ordinarily constitute a request for, and a failure to make, a\n\nclaim of nationality under the MDLEA.          The issue remaining is whether\n\nthe statute's requirement that the questioning take place \"aboard\" the\n\nsuspect vessel includes within its scope questioning that took place\n\n\"aboard\" the Dominican cutter.\n\n               The majority concludes that \"aboard\" as used in section\n\n70502(d)(1)(B) is sufficiently elastic to embrace the questioning that\n\ntook   place    here,   despite    my   colleagues'   recognition   that   the\n\ncircumstances fall outside the MDLEA if \"aboard\" is given its common\n\nmeaning of \"on board.\"26          In essence, the majority concludes that\n\n\"near\" the yola is close enough to \"aboard\" the yola in light of the\n\nother indicators of statelessness, including the absence of a flag or\n\nregistry papers and the crew's failure to make an affirmative claim\n\nof nationality.\n\n               But a court does not have license to expand the scope of\n\na criminal statute merely because it believes that doing so is\n\n\n       25\n       Officer Young further testified: \"I asked who was the captain\nof the vessel they were on or the senior person, and they responded\nthat there was no single person in charge. . . . Because I could not\nget one individual to make a claim for the vessel, I then questioned\nwhat was the nationality of the personnel. And they had all told me\nand informed me that they were from the Dominican Republic. I asked\nif the boat had come from the Dominican Republic as well, and they,\nin turn, agreed.\"\n       26\n        The majority observes in a footnote that the dictionary\ndefinitions of \"aboard\" include \"alongside of.\" As described infra,\nhowever, the international law context leaves no doubt that Congress\nhad the ordinary usage of the word in mind. See infra.\n\n                                        -44-\n\fconsistent with Congress's law enforcement objectives.                      In enacting\n\nthe MDLEA, Congress was acting against the backdrop of international\n\nlaw.     As noted earlier, the international standard for deeming\n\nstatelessness requires proof that a vessel \"repeatedly, deliberately,\n\nand successfully\" obscured its nationality.                    Meyers, supra, at 322.\n\nThe    MDLEA    criteria      for   deeming     statelessness,      allowing    such    a\n\ndetermination based on a single failure to respond, are significantly\n\nless demanding and may in fact overstep international norms.                        See\n\nEugene    Kontorovich,        Beyond    the     Article    I     Horizon:    Congress's\n\nEnumerated Powers and Universal Jurisdiction over Drug Crimes, 93\n\nMinn.    L.    Rev.   1191,    1228    (2009)    (\"[T]he   MDLEA's     definition      of\n\nstatelessness goes far beyond what is recognized by international\n\ncustom or convention.\").            Although Congress has the prerogative to go\n\nbeyond the limits of international law, see, e.g., Bradley, supra, at\n\n331 (\"Congress is free to override the limitations of international\n\nlaw, including the international law of prescriptive jurisdiction,\n\nwhen enacting a criminal statute.\"), we exceed our authority if we go\n\nbeyond Congress in this sensitive realm.\n\n                There is every reason to conclude that Congress did not\n\ninclude the word \"aboard\" in section 70502(d)(1)(B) casually.                    To the\n\ncontrary, the boarding of vessels by law enforcement officials                     is a\n\nsignificant step, and allowing authorities to board for limited\n\ninvestigatory purposes is a traditional \"exception to the principle\n\nof noninterference on the high seas.\"               United States v.

Except where acts of interference derive from powers\n      conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters a foreign\n      merchant ship on the high seas is not justified in boarding\n      her unless there is reasonable ground for suspecting:\n\n      (a) That the ship is engaged in piracy; or\n      (b) That the ship is engaged in the slave trade; or\n      (c) That, though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show\n      its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality\n      as the warship.\n\n      2. In the cases provided for in sub-paragraphs (a), (b)\n      and (c) above, the warship may proceed to verify the ship's\n      right to fly its flag. To this end, it may send a boat\n      under the command of an officer to the suspected ship. If\n      suspicion remains after the documents have been checked, it\n      may proceed to a further examination on board the ship,\n      which must be carried out with all possible consideration.\n\nA Coast Guard cutter is considered a \"warship\" for purposes of this\nprovision.

As I have noted, the\n\nauthority conferred by that provision's language is, arguably, already\n\nbeyond the bounds of international law.          I can see no justification\n\nfor broadening the statute's scope even further by ignoring its\n\nliteral terms.    If the majority were correct that failure to respond\n\nto questioning on an adjacent vessel is equivalent to questioning\n\n\"aboard\" the target vessel, what principle would distinguish inquiry\n\nat a Coast Guard station located just ashore?           In such circumstances,\n\nthe limited \"right to visit\" becomes a license to conduct questioning\n\nof a ship's crew wherever convenient for the authorities.             In my view,\n\nneither    scenario   falls   within    a   provision   that   deems   a   vessel\n\n\n\n      28\n         Officer Young testified that the yola was boarded pursuant\nto a right of visit.\n\n                                       -47-\n\fstateless based on a specific interaction that occurs \"aboard\" that\n\nvessel.29\n\n               Abiding by the plain language of the statute need not\n\nfrustrate Congress's objective to prosecute maritime drug trafficking\n\nnor undermine law enforcement efforts. In this case, for example, the\n\nCoast Guard could likely have brought the defendants within the scope\n\nof the MDLEA by obtaining the consent of the Dominican Republic, the\n\nyola's      apparent   country   of     nationality.   See   46   U.S.C.\n\n§ 70502(c)(1)(C).      Alternatively, the government could have alleged\n\nthat the yola was either a Dominican vessel or a stateless vessel and\n\nfurther investigated its nationality after the defendants' arrest.\n\nCf. United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d 158, 175 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding\n\nthat the MDLEA's jurisdictional element may be satisfied by consent\n\nobtained \"any time before trial\"); United States v. Bustos-Useche, 273\n\nF.3d 622, 627 (5th Cir. 2001) (same); United States v. Cardales, 168\n\nF.3d 548, 552 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding jurisdictional requirement met\n\nwhere consent provided after Coast Guard's boarding of ship).30     That\n\n\n      29\n        The majority's observation that Congress used the word\n\"includes\" when it listed specific instances of deemed statelessness\ndoes not help its argument that section 70502(d)(1) reaches the\ncircumstances here. To construe the word \"aboard\" as the majority\nproposes is effectively to nullify a limitation on the scope of the\nstatute as enacted.    The rules of statutory construction do not\npermit us to rewrite the statute by ignoring a word chosen by\nCongress. See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979)\n(\"In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible,\nto every word Congress used.\").\n      30\n        Indeed, as noted supra, the United States has authority to\nsearch any Dominican vessel on the high seas suspected of involvement\n\n                                      -48-\n\fthe government failed to pursue those avenues in this case does not\n\njustify extending the scope of a criminal statute beyond its plain\n\nterms.31\n\n                                    IV.\n\n              The issues raised in this appeal are difficult, and I\n\nrespect the majority's thoughtful attempt to resolve them.         In the\n\nend, however, I fear that the majority's focus on Congress's \"aim to\n\nfacilitate    enforcement\"   has   overshadowed   the   considerations   of\n\nfairness and international law that counsel restraint in interpreting\n\nthe MDLEA.    The majority's interpretation extends United States drug\n\nlaws to circumstances that Congress did not contemplate and that\n\nlikely exceed the bounds of international law as well.       In addition,\n\nthe majority has lowered the traditional standard of proof for finding\n\nguilt.     I would not reach either of those results in the absence of\n\na clear statement that Congress intended its penal laws to reach so\n\nbroadly.\n\n              For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\nin drug trafficking.    Because the Dominican Republic retains the\nright to prosecute individuals for such crimes, the United States\npresumably would transfer the custody of any arrested persons upon\nrequest from the Dominican government if the vessel were determined\nto be Dominican.\n      31\n       Of course, federal officers may encounter scenarios in which\nan overly rigid reading of the statute would truly frustrate\ncongressional purposes. See, e.g., Rosero, 42 F.3d at 174 (\"By clear\nimplication, . . . [the failure to claim nationality] provision\napplies when the master of a ship flees and leaves no one in\ncharge . . . .\"). This case does not present such a situation.\n\n                                   -49-\n\f",

Grindler, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Rosa E. Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson J. Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, BOUDIN and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This appeal by several defendants convicted of drug traffickingEpifanio Matos-Luchi, Manolo Soto-Perez, and Ramon Carrasco-Carrascorequires the interpretation of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (\"MDLEA\"), 46 U.S.C. § 70501 <i>et seq.</i> (2006), which <i>inter alia</i> delineates federal enforcement authority over drug crimes carried on at sea outside U.S. territorial limits. The factual background and proceedings in the district court are as follows.</p>\n<p>In May 2007, Petty Officer Richard Young and a team of five other U.S. Coast Guard personnel were stationed on the HMS <i>Ocean,</i> a British aircraft carrier, to assist with law enforcement efforts in the Carribean Sea. On May 12, the Coast Guard team deployed in a helicopter to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2</span> investigate a low-flying airplane spotted in the vicinity; from the air, they saw the plane drop several bale-shaped packages into the sea about thirty to thirty-five miles from the coast of the Dominican Republic.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>A small boat waiting nearbya twenty to twenty-five foot fishing \"yola\" propelled by an outboard motor and allegedly crewed by the three defendantsthen approached the drop site and began to retrieve the bales. The officers suspected drug trafficking and descended in the helicopter. The boat crew jettisoned the bales and fled. After giving chase for nearly an hour, the Coast Guard helicopter returned to the drop site to retrieve the bales, which proved to contain packages of cocaine.</p>\n<p>While the helicopter retrieved the drugs, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection airplane followed the yola as it proceeded north towards the Dominican Republic. The boat experienced engine problems and halted about twenty-five miles from the Dominican coast. At the request of the U.S. Customs officials, a Dominican Coast Guard cutter sailed out to retrieve the yola and its crew. The three crew members were taken on board the cutter and the yola was tied to its stern.</p>\n<p>Later that evening, Young and two others traveled from the HMS <i>Ocean</i> to the Dominican cutter where, with the permission of the Dominican authorities, they questioned the three defendants who now were on board the cutter. Young later testified that when questioned, Matos, Soto and Carrasco declined to make a claim of nationality for the yola:</p>\n<blockquote>I asked ... who was the captain of the vessel they were on or the senior person in charge of the boat, and they responded there was no single person in charge. Since I could not determine if there was a captain of the vessel, I asked if anybody would like to speak for the boat and give me a claim of nationality. And they shook their heads no, and actually did not give me a full response. Because I could not get one individual to make a claim for the vessel, I then questioned what was the nationality of the personnel. And they had all told me and informed me that they were from the Dominican Republic. I asked if the boat had come from the Dominican Republic as well, and they, in turn, agreed.</blockquote>\n<p>While Young interrogated the yola crew, another Coast Guard officer boarded the yola, now tied to the stern of the cutter. No ensign, flag, registration, or other evidence of the vessel's nationality was found on board. The U.S. Coast Guard crew were instructed by their superiors to detain the defendants, who were transferred to the HMS <i>Ocean</i> and then brought to Puerto Rico for prosecution in federal district court.</p>\n<p>The defendants were charged by indictment with violations of the MDLEA: one count of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute, 46 U.S.C. § 70503, and one count of aiding and abetting that crime, 18 U.S.C. § 2 (2006), all while on board a \"vessel without nationality\" and so within the enforcement authority of the United States, 46 U.S.C. §§ 70502(c)(1)(A), 70503(a)(1). The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment \"for lack of jurisdiction,\" arguing that there was no proof that they were on board a \"vessel without nationality\" as alleged in the indictment. The district court held that motion in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> abeyance, and the defendants proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p>When the government rested its case in chief, the defendants sought a judgment of acquittal from the court, repeating that there was no proof that they were on board a \"vessel without nationality.\" The court denied the motion. The most extensive explanation given by the judge, provided in response to defense counsel's repeated efforts to have the jury instructed on the issue, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Title [46], the law defines a vessel without nationality. And look at this. A vessel on which the master or individual in chargeyou need a master or individual in charge, to begin withfails on request of an officer of the United States, authorized to enforce applicable United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And then what happens on top of that, you have a vessel that is in international waters, no written registration on the outside. No name, no flying flag, no nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I believe it is entirely up to me to make a determination as to jurisdiction, and I'm convinced that there is jurisdiction, so I cannot ask the jury to make that determination.</blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, the jury found the defendants guilty as charged of possession with intent to distribute the seized drugs. Conformably with the statute, the issue of whether the vessel was without nationality was not submitted to the jury. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a). Based on the weight of the cocaine recoveredwhich was 386 kilogramsthe defendants were later each sentenced to 235 months' imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>The most abstruse issue in the case, with which we begin, is whether the defendants' possession of the cocaine with intent to distribute occurred on board \"a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1). To put the issue in context requires an understanding of the design and background of the MDLEAa statute initially enacted in 1986 as 46 U.S.C.app. § 1903, <i>see</i> Pub.L. No. 99-570, § 3202, 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-95 to -97 (1986), and later relocated to its present code sections, 46 U.S.C. §§ 70501-70507, <i>see</i> Pub.L. No. 109-304, § 10(2), 120 Stat. 1485, 1685-89 (2006).</p>\n<p>Invoking its constitutional power \"[t]o define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas,\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 10, Congress in the MDLEA made it unlawful <i>inter alia</i> for anyone to</p>\n<blockquote>knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance on board ... a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States... even though the act is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p>46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)-(b).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Underscoring its aim to reach broadly, Congress defined \"a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" to include six categories of boats (listed in full in an appendix to this decision)first among them \"a vessel without nationality,\" 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> In turn, \"a vessel without nationality\" is defined to \"include[]\" the following:</p>\n<blockquote>(A) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge makes a claim of registry that is denied by the nation whose registry is claimed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge fails, on request of an officer of the United States authorized to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(C) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge makes a claim of registry for which the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.</blockquote>\n<p>46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1).</p>\n<p>That the listed examples do not exhaust the scope of section 70502(d) is confirmed by Congress' contrasting use of the phrase \"includes only\" in a related provision,<sup>[3]</sup> by its evident and explicit attempts to sweep quite broadly, <i>see, e.g.,</i> S. Rep. 99-530, at 15-16, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5986 (1986), and by relevant precedent, <i>United States v. Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d 166, 170 (3d Cir.1994) (Alito, J.). At the very least, Congress intended to include in section 70502(d), in addition to the specific examples given, those vessels that could be considered stateless under customary international law. <i>Id.</i> at 170-71; <i>see also</i> H.R.Rep. No. 96-323, at 23-24 (1979) (discussing predecessor statute).</p>\n<p>Congress' intent to reach broadly was reconfirmed in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-324, § 1138, 110 Stat. 3901, 3988-89, which amended the MDLEA by providing that the \"jurisdiction\" of the United States over a vessel under the MDLEA was \"not an element of the offense\" but a matter to be determined \"solely by the trial judge,\" <i>id.</i> § 1138(a)(5) (now codified at 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a)), and that a defendant had no standing to claim that enforcement violated \"international law\"reserving such objections only to foreign nations, <i>id.</i> § 1138(a)(4) (now codified at 46 U.S.C. § 70505).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Against this background, the district court's determination that the defendants' yola was \"a vessel without nationality\" within the meaning of the MDLEA was correct. This is so regardless of whether that finding is to be made by a preponderance of the evidenceas one of our earlier decisions implies, <i>Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 523 F.3d at 20 (separate opinion of Lynch &amp; Howard, JJ.)or beyond a reasonable doubt. Indeed, virtually none of the raw facts bearing on the reach of the statute is disputed; the problem is primarily one of interpreting the statute.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Still, the burden of proof question is likely to be a recurring one for district courts within the circuit. In our view, Congress intended it to be a preliminary issue, like venue and other judge-determined issues, to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. In <i>González,</i> 311 F.3d at 443, we likened U.S. jurisdiction over a vessel to statutory language that signals Congress' invocation of its own authority, like \"affects interstate commerce\"; but unlike other such \"jurisdictional hooks\" decided by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the reach of the statute in this case is not an element of the offense, 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a).</p>\n<p>Our readingrequiring proof only to a preponderanceis common to many judge-determined issues, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Vanvliet,</i> 542 F.3d 259, 264 (1st Cir.2008) (consent to search); <i>United States v. Schussel,</i> 291 Fed.Appx. 336, 343 (1st Cir.2008) (unpublished) (existence of privilege); <i>United States v. Rojas-Tapia,</i> 446 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.) (voluntariness of confession), <i>cert. denied,</i> 549 U.S. 905, 127 S.Ct. 231, 166 L.Ed.2d 183 (2006); <i>United States v. Garza,</i> 435 F.3d 73, 77 (1st Cir.) (admissibility of evidence), <i>cert. denied,</i> 547 U.S. 1158, 126 S.Ct. 2313, 164 L.Ed.2d 832 (2006); <i>United States v. Wiggin,</i> 429 F.3d 31, 36-37 (1st Cir.2005) (competency to stand trial); <i>United States v. Cordero,</i> 668 F.2d 32, 44 n. 18 (1st Cir.1981) (propriety of venue), and it here comports with Congress' aim to facilitate enforcement. Defendants raise no constitutional objection on this issue, and we see none.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Turning now to the issue of the yola as a stateless vessel, viewed in part retrospectively, the boat had various links to the Dominican Republic. The crew members were Dominicans and the small vessel was likely headed there before its engine troubles and subsequent interception by the Dominican Coast Guard. At trial one defendant said that the vessel was registered there in some fashion. But neither the MDLEA nor international law limits U.S. enforcement authority merely because the vessel has associations with another state.</p>\n<p>Under international law, every vessel must sail under the flag of one and only one state; those that sail under no flag or more than one flag enjoy no legal protection. 1 L. Oppenheim, <i>International Law</i> § 261, at 595-96 (H. Lauterpacht ed., 8th ed.1955); <i>see also</i> Convention on the High Seas art. 6, Apr. 29, 1958, 13 U.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82; <i>United States v. Victoria,</i> 876 F.2d 1009, 1010-11 (1st Cir.1989). By custom, a vessel claims nationality by flying the flag of the nation with which it is affiliated or carrying papers showing it to be registered with that nation. 1 Oppenheim, <i>supra,</i> §§ 260-261, at 594-96. Without a flag or papers, a vessel may also traditionally make an oral claim of nationality when a proper demand is madea pattern the MDLEA follows. <i>See supra</i> note 3 (quoting 46 U.S.C. § 70502(e)).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> Although enforcement jurisdiction presumptively lies with the flag state, 1 Oppenheim, <i>supra,</i> § 266, at 603, \"[i]t is not enough that a vessel have a nationality; she must claim it and be in a position to provide evidence of it.\" Anderson, <i>supra</i> note 6, at 341. Anderson, <i>id.</i> at 336-37, pertinently quotes a Privy Council judgment:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he freedom of the open sea, whatever those words may connote, is a freedom of ships which fly, and are entitled to fly, the flag of a State.... Their Lordships would accept as a valid statement of international law, the following passage from Oppenheim's International Law...: \"In the interest of order on the open sea, a vessel not sailing under the maritime flag of a State enjoys no protection whatever....\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Molvan v. Att'y-Gen. for Palestine,</i> [1948] A.C. 351 (P.C.) 369-70; <i>see also</i> 1 Oppenheim, <i>supra,</i> § 261, at 595.</p>\n<p>The MDLEA follows this approach, one might say, energetically. Section 70502(d) \"includes\" in the phrase \"vessel without nationality\" those ships for which a claim of nationality is made but rejected or not backed up by the nation invoked, 46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1)(A), (C), <i>or</i> those \"aboard which the master of individual in charge\" fails on request \"to make a claim of nationality or registration\" for the vessel, <i>id.</i> § 70502(d)(1)(B). In our case, the defendants when questioned by the U.S. Coast Guard refused to make a claim of nationality for the yola.</p>\n<p>That questioning was aboard the Dominican cutter rather than the defendants' yola and so arguably does not fit within the language of section 70502(d)(1)(B)at least if \"aboard\" is given its common meaning of \"on board.\"<sup>[7]</sup> But neither \"aboard\" the yola, nor adjacent to it on the cutter, did any crew member make an affirmative claim of nationality for the vessel, nor did the yola fly a flag or carry registry papers issued by any state. Under both the statute and international law, this is more than enough to \"include\" the yola as a vessel \"without nationality\" within the meaning of the MDLEA even if it is merely similar to and not within one of the specific examples given in the statute.</p>\n<p>Practically every vessel, including the legendary Flying Dutchman, has links with some country; but the stateless vessel concept in the MDLEA and in international law is designed <i>prudentially.</i> The controlling question is whether at the point at which the authorities confront the vessel, it bears the insignia or papers of a national vessel or its master is prepared to make an affirmative and sustainable claim of nationality. To read the MDLEA more restrictively would mean that the master and crew need only carry no papers and jump overboard to avoid having their vessel classed as stateless. <i>Cf. </i><i>González,</i> 311 F.3d at 449 (Torruella, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p>The defendants are not entitled to raise a violation of international law as an objection, <i>see</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70505, but in any case the MDLEA does not conflict with international law. For international law too treats the \"stateless vessel\" concept as informed by the need for effective enforcement. Thus, a vessel may be deemed \"stateless,\" and subject to the enforcement jurisdiction of any nation on the scene, if it fails to display or carry insignia of nationality and seeks to avoid national identification. This occurs</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> if a \"ship\" repeatedly refuses, without reasonable excuse, to reveal its allocation [of nationality]. If no registration number is visible and no other indicator [of nationality] can be discerned, the cognoscibility is already demonstrably insufficient, and interference will then often be justifiable.... From the basic design of [the law of sea] and from the place the institution here called allocation occupies in it already it may be concluded that a \"ship\" which obscures the cognoscibility of its allocation repeatedly, deliberately, and successfully may be treated as stateless.</blockquote>\n<p>H. Meyers, <i>The Nationality of Ships</i> 322 (1967)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>In sum, the instances specified by Congresspertinently, the refusal \"aboard\" the vessel to claim nationality, 46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1)(B)are not departures from international law but merely part of a pattern consistent with it; and when Congress used the word \"includes\" in listing specific instances, it allowed for reasonable extrapolation to functionally similar instancesincluding a refusal by the crew to claim nationality that happens to occur aboard a cutter which has the subject \"vessel\" in tow.</p>\n<p>The MDLEA was responding to repeatedly frustrated efforts to prosecute maritime drug trafficking. Anderson, <i>supra</i> note 6, at 325-27 (describing enforcement history). The statute's provisions dovetail: a refusal to claim nationality renders the unflagged vessel stateless and so within federal jurisdiction, while a supportable claim of nationality allows the federal authorities to seek jurisdiction by consent of the flag nation, <i>e.g.,</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(1)(C). Congress did not expect courts to render a cramped reading of the statute.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we need not decide whether (in the alternative) the transfer of the crew by the Dominican Coast Guard constituted \"consent\" by the Dominican Republic to federal enforcement. Consent would satisfy the MDLEA, 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(1)(C) (consent of flag state); <i>id.</i> § 70502(c)(1)(E) (consent of state in whose territorial waters vessel is found), and accord with international law, <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 843 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 488 U.S. 834, 109 S.Ct. 93, 102 L.Ed.2d 69 (1988). Whether such informal consent is enough may be an open question. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Matos, Soto and Carrasco also raise a host of other claims on appealall requiring less discussion than the authority question. Our decision has thus far assumed thatas the jury necessarily foundthe defendants <i>were</i> the crew first sighted by the helicopter and seen to throw overboard bales that were recovered and found to contain cocaine. The defendants say that the evidence for this identification was insufficient.</p>\n<p>The defendants stress that the Dominican cutter that retrieved them had already intercepted and detained a second yola, with a crew of two. The defendants argue that the government's evidence was insufficient to prove that they were on the yola seen gathering drugs rather than on this second, innocent yola, because Officer Young testified at trial that the three defendants \"could be\" the same three persons that he observed from his helicopter. The argument was preserved in a motion for acquittal, so our review is <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. Potter,</i> 463 F.3d 9, 13-14 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a rational jury could easily have found the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Although no single witness had a continuous view of the yola from the time <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> the boat was first spotted until the moment it was apprehended by the Dominican cutter, there was abundant evidence from which to identify the defendants as the crew-members and the evidence is not less powerful because some of it rested upon reasonable inference rather than eye-witness identification. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Santana-Rosa,</i> 132 F.3d 860, 866 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>The evidence at trial included testimony from Officer Young that the defendants' age and build matched the three persons observed on the yola; multiple videos and photos of the yola from which the jury could infer the same; ion scans of cocaine residue on the skin and clothing of the defendants;<sup>[8]</sup> and testimony from the lieutenant of the Dominican cutter than the two-man yola crew and three-man yola crew were segregated on his boat and thus unlikely to be mixed up.</p>\n<p>The defendants also raise two other arguments under the heading of their identification challenge but which in truth present different legal questions. First, they claim that the government denied them a fair trial by failing to produce the only witness allegedly in a position to settle the identification issue, a Dominican official named Carmelo Matos Rodriguez. Government <i>interference</i> in the production of witnesses helpful to the defendant may in some circumstances preclude a fair trial, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Castro,</i> 129 F.3d 226, 232 (1st Cir.1997), <i>cert. denied,</i> 523 U.S. 1100, 118 S.Ct. 1569, 140 L.Ed.2d 803 (1998), but nothing like that is evident in this case.</p>\n<p>A trial subpoena was issued at defendants' request for Matos Rodriguez on March 27, 2008, and the government apparently attempted to secure his presence at trial. But the <i>defendants</i> incorrectly identified Matos Rodriguez as a member of the \"Dominican Coast Guard\" when he was in fact with the Dominican equivalent of the Drug Enforcement Agency. When the error was discovered and Matos Rodriguez located, there was insufficient time to get him the necessary documents to travel to the United States. The defendants never sought a continuance.</p>\n<p>Defendants seem to claim, at least at oral argument, that they were <i>affirmatively</i> misled by the government into believing that Matos Rodriguez would appearonly to be told the contrary on the first day of trial. We ordered supplemental briefing from the defendants on this specific issue after argument, instructing them to \"provide relevant transcript and record references.\" Instead, they submitted a brief that relies entirely on alleged pretrial conversations and affidavits from their own employeesnone of which is part of the record on appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 10(a).</p>\n<p>Second, defendants assail the instructions given to the jury on identification during deliberations, after the jury sent a note requesting clarification on the issue; they complain that the trial judge alluded to hypothetical testimony by a witness who looks at a lineup and says \"I think it's number two.\" Their position is that \"I think\" is too equivocal for proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that the instruction would have misled the jury into thinking that a doubtful identification was sufficient to convict.</p>\n<p>No objection was made to the instruction at the time it was made, so it is reviewed only for plain error, <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> <i>States v. Rogers,</i> 41 F.3d 25, 30-31 (1st Cir.1994), <i>cert. denied,</i> 515 U.S. 1126, 115 S.Ct. 2287, 132 L.Ed.2d 289 (1995), but on reading the instruction ourselves, we see no error at all. The court correctly instructed the jury on the <i>types</i> of evidence it could consider and reminded the jury at defense counsel's requestthat identification had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Nothing in the instructions suggested that a doubtful identification was sufficient.</p>\n<p>Next, defendants argue that the evidence was insufficient as to mens rea; they claim thateven if they were the persons on board the yola observed retrieving the airdropped balesthere was insufficient evidence that they knew the bales contained contraband as opposed to innocent cargo. Again, the argument was preserved in a motion for acquittal, so our review is <i>de novo,</i> taking all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the government. <i>United States v. Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 522 U.S. 870, 118 S.Ct. 184, 139 L.Ed.2d 124 (1997). But again the evidence here amply supports the verdict and is well within our precedents.</p>\n<p>The defendants' yola was seen idling in the drop site before collecting the bales, <i>cf. </i><i>Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d at 343; the yola lacked fishing equipment, despite defendants' claim at trial to have been out fishing; the defendants jettisoned the bales and fled at the first sign of the Coast Guard, <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Piedrahita-Santiago,</i> 931 F.2d 127, 131 (1st Cir.1991); and the defendants and their clothing showed traces of the drug. Nor is it common for valuable cargo to be entrusted to persons unaware of its contents. <i>United States v. Angulo-Hernández,</i> 565 F.3d 2, 8 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 776, 175 L.Ed.2d 540 (2009).</p>\n<p>Finally, at sentencing, defendants sought a reduction in the calculation of their offense level because they were minor participants in the crime, U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b) (2008)an argument rejected by the sentencing judgeas well as a reduction under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny. They never clearly articulated then or now why a sentence within the guidelines range would be unreasonable or unjust (except that it was long); instead, they argue on appeal that the sentencing judge failed to understand his discretion to depart downwards under <i>Booker.</i></p>\n<p>At one point, the sentencing judge stated that \"[t]here is nothing before the Court that would allow [it] to make any meaningful exercise of any additional sentencing factor under [18 U.S.C. §] 3553(a), because nothing of the sort has been argued.\" In context, we see no indication that the judge misunderstood his authority; rather he simply thought that the defendants had offered no persuasive reason for a lower sentence. The latter judgment was his to make.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX</h2>\n<p>46 U.S.C. § 70502(c) (2006) states in full:</p>\n<blockquote>(c) Vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) In general.In this chapter, the term \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" includes</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(A) a vessel without nationality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) a vessel assimilated to a vessel without nationality under paragraph (2) of article 6 of the 1958 Convention on the High Seas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(C) a vessel registered in a foreign nation if that nation has consented or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> waived objection to the enforcement of United States law by the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(D) a vessel in the customs waters of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(E) a vessel in the territorial waters of a foreign nation if the nation consents to the enforcement of United States law by the United States; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(F) a vessel in the contiguous zone of the United States, as defined in Presidential Proclamation 7219 of September 2, 1999 (43 U.S.C. 1331 note), that</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) is entering the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(ii) has departed the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(iii) is a hovering vessel as defined in section 401 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Consent or waiver of objection. Consent or waiver of objection by a foreign nation to the enforcement of United States law by the United States under paragraph (1)(C) or (E)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(A) may be obtained by radio, telephone, or similar oral or electronic means; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) is proved conclusively by certification of the Secretary of State or the Secretary's designee.</blockquote>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA) makes it unlawful for an individual to \"knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance on board (1) a vessel of the United States or a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; or (2) any vessel if the individual is a citizen of the United States or a resident alien of the United States.\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a). The majority, after concluding that the government need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a vessel is \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" holds that the government met its burden in this case because it established that the defendants' small fishing boat was a \"vessel without nationality\" within the meaning of the statute. <i>See id.</i> § 70502(c) (defining \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" to include \"a vessel without nationality\"). I disagree with both of those conclusions. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The MDLEA was one of a series of steps Congress took in the 1980s and 1990s to extend the reach of the federal drug laws beyond the territory of the United States. Because the function and meaning of the critical phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" is not self-evident, it is important to understand the MDLEA's design and background. I therefore begin by reviewing the legislative context giving rise to the statute and its jurisdictional requirement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Marijuana on the High Seas Act</h2>\n<p>Before 1980, maritime drug smugglers outside the territorial waters of the United States generally had to be prosecuted for conspiracy to import drugs into the United States. That regime proved to be unsatisfactory, primarily because of the difficulty of proving an intent to import. The problem was not that the Coast Guard lacked the authority to interdict drug smugglers and seize contraband; to the contrary, the Coast Guard has long enjoyed \"`one of the most sweeping grants of police authority ever to be written into U.S. law.'\" Note, <i>High on the Seas: Drug Smuggling, the Fourth Amendment, and Warrantless Searches at Sea,</i> 93 Harv. L.Rev. 725, 726 (1980) (quoting Stephen H. Evans, <i>The United States Coast Guard 1790-1915</i> 218 (1949)); <i>see</i> 14 U.S.C. § 89(a) (setting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> forth Coast Guard's enforcement authority). Rather, the problem derived from the limited substantive scope of the maritime drug laws: \"in most cases the Coast Guard [was] able to seize and confiscate the ship and the illegal drugs, but the government [was] not able to prosecute the crew or others involved in the smuggling operation.\" S.Rep. No. 96-855, at 2 (1980).</p>\n<p>Congress responded to the problem by enacting the Marijuana on the High Seas Act, Pub.L. No. 96-350, 94 Stat. 1159 (1980), which broadened the drug laws in a number of ways. Most importantly, the statute made it a crime for certain individuals on the high seas to possess drugs with the intent to distribute, which obviated the need to prove that the drugs were destined for the United States and opened the door for a much broader extraterritorial application of the federal drug laws. <i>See</i> 125 Cong. Rec. 20,083 (1979) (statement of Rep. Paul McCloskey) (\"Where current law requires an intent to import a controlled substance into the United States as a necessary element of the crime[,] this bill essentially requires only knowledge or intent to distribute with no need to establish a U.S. destination. Such intent may be inferred from the presence of controlled substances that exceed normal consumptionand that are not entered as cargo on a vessel's manifest.\").</p>\n<p>The majority is correct that the Marijuana on the High Seas Act and its successor statutes manifest an intent to reach broadly. Congress was concerned about maritime drug trafficking and sought to \"give the Justice Department the maximum prosecutorial authority permitted under international law.\" S. Rep. 96-855, at 2; <i>see also</i> 125 Cong. Rec. 20,083 (1979) (statement of Rep. Paul McCloskey) (stating that the bill authorizes prosecution \"to the broadest extent possible under international law\"). As the quoted legislative history makes clear, however, Congress also intended to stay within the boundaries of international law, which places limitations on a nation's power \"to make its law applicable to the activities, relations, or status of persons.\" <i>Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States</i> § 401(a) (1987). Those limitations, referred to under the heading \"jurisdiction to prescribe,\" have traditionally permitted nations to legislate with respect to (1) their own nationals; (2) acts committed within, or having substantial effects within, their territory; and (3) acts directed at their national security.<sup>[9]</sup><i>Id.</i> § 402.</p>\n<p>On the high seas, there is an additional basis of jurisdiction to prescribe: vessel nationality.<sup>[10]</sup> Vessels, like people, are capable of having nationality, and a vessel on the high seas (and those aboard it) may be subjected to the laws of the country whose nationality she bears. <i>See id.</i> § 502(2). A Canadian vessel, for example, may properly be subjected to the laws of Canada. The high seas legal regime depends upon <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> vessels having one, and only one, nationality. Vessels without any nationality at all (also referred to as stateless vessels) are subject to the prescriptive jurisdiction of every nation. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Victoria,</i> 876 F.2d 1009, 1010-11 (1st Cir.1989); <i>United States v. Marino-Garcia,</i> 679 F.2d 1373, 1380-83 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p>Although the settled bases of prescriptive jurisdiction are broad, they are not limitless. A country must be able to point to one of those bases when extending its penal laws to an individual. If Congress had made it a federal crime for any person to possess drugs on board any vessel anywhere, it would have run afoul of the international legal limitations on its jurisdiction to prescribe.<sup>[11]</sup> Congress therefore limited the reach of the Marijuana on the High Seas Act to five categories of persons: (1) United States citizens, (2) individuals on board a vessel within the customs waters of the United States, (3) individuals intending to import drugs into United States territory or who know drugs will be imported into the United States, (4) individuals on board a vessel with United States nationality, and (5) individuals on board a U.S. vessel or a \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States on the high seas,\" which was defined to include a \"vessel without nationality or a vessel assimilated to a vessel without nationality.\" Pub.L. No. 96-350, 94 Stat. 1159. Each of those categories corresponds to one of the traditional bases for exercising prescriptive jurisdictionnationality of the defendant, territoriality, national security, nationality of the vessel, and statelessness. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 96-323, at 10-11 (1979). The point made explicit in the legislative history is thus apparent from the text of the statute as well: Congress intended to extend the maritime drug laws to what it viewed as the limits provided by international law, but no further.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act</h2>\n<p>By 1986, Congress had become convinced that the Marijuana on the High Seas Act was in need of revision. In Congress's view, \"defendants in cases involving foreign or stateless vessel boardings and seizures [had] been relying heavily on international jurisdictional questions as legal technicalities to escape conviction.\" S.Rep. No. 99-530, at 15, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5986, 6000 (1986). Congress enacted the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, Pub.L. 99-640, § 17, 100 Stat. 3545 (1986), with a view toward further expanding and strengthening the maritime drug laws. Its approach was measured, however. Although Congress extended the statute's coverage to several new categories of defendantsmost notably, to individuals on board \"a vessel registered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of United States law by the United States\"<sup>[13]</sup>it otherwise retained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> the pre-existing restrictions on the statute's substantive scope. <i>Id.</i> Congress also added a provision partially defining the phrase \"vessel without nationality,\" which had been left undefined in the original statute.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. 1996 Amendments</h2>\n<p>Congress amended the MDLEA again in 1996. <i>See</i> Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-324, § 1138, 110 Stat. 3901, 3988-89 (1996). The intent, as before, was to \"expand the Government's prosecutorial effectiveness in drug smuggling cases.\" H.R.Rep. No. 104-854, at 142, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4239, 4292 (1996) (Conf.Rep.). To that end, Congress further expanded the definition of \"vessel without nationality,\" Pub.L. No. 104-324, § 1138(a)(1),<sup>[15]</sup> added provisions making it easier for the government to prove that a foreign nation consented to the prosecution, <i>id.</i> § 1138(a)(2)-(3), and declared that MDLEA defendants \"shall not have standing to raise the claim of failure to comply with international law as a basis for a defense,\" <i>id.</i> § 1138(a)(4). Congress also enacted an unusual provision that has assumed importance in this case:</p>\n<blockquote>Jurisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense. All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 1138(a)(5). Otherwise, the amendments left the substantive limitations on the MDLEA's scope unaltered.</p>\n<p>With this background in mind, I turn to the majority's analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The majority holds, as a threshold matter, that the government's proof that the defendants' vessel is covered by the MDLEA must be by a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. I do not agree. Like the majority, I do not believe the burden of proof affects the outcome of this case. Nevertheless, I wish to respond to the majority's analysis.</p>\n<p>Prior to the 1996 amendments to the MDLEA, vessel status had to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir.1997).<sup>[16]</sup> The 1996 amendments expressly removed the vessel status issue from the jury's consideration. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a). They did not address the standard of proof, however. I would presume, in the absence of any tex-tual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> indication to the contrary, that Congress did not intend to silently alter the longstanding rule that vessel status must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 2178, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010) (\"Congress does not enact substantive changes <i>sub silentio.</i>\").</p>\n<p>The majority offers several justifications for reading an implied shift in the standard of proof into the 1996 amendments. First, it says that Congress intended vessel status to be \"a preliminary issue, like venue and other judge-determined issues\" that are commonly proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a) (characterizing \"[j]urisdiction,\" i.e., vessel status, as a \"preliminary question[] of law\"). But that rationale is in conflict with our decision in <i>United States v. González,</i> 311 F.3d 440 (1st Cir.2002), where we held that vessel status goes to \"the substantive reach of the statute applying to some vessels but not others\" rather than to the threshold issue of the court's authority to hear the case. <i>Id.</i> at 443 (emphasis omitted). Unlike venue and the other procedural and evidentiary matters mentioned by the majority, a failure to prove that defendants' conduct occurred on board a covered vessel amounts to a failure to prove that the defendants violated the MDLEA. <i>Compare id.</i> (\"Congress asserted its own authority to regulate drug trafficking on some ships but not all ships and, in this context, used the word `jurisdiction' loosely to describe its own assertion of authority to regulate; it does the same thing whenever it fixes an `affects interstate commerce' or `involved a federally insured bank' as a condition of the crime.\"), <i>with </i><i>Am. Dredging Co. v. Miller,</i> 510 U.S. 443, 453, 114 S.Ct. 981, 127 L.Ed.2d 285 (1994) (\"[V]enue is a matter that goes to process rather than substantive rightsdetermining which among various competent courts will decide the case.\").<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>It is equally unhelpful to suggest, as the majority does, that Congress's allocation of decision-making authority to the judge necessarily implies a shift in the standard of proof because \"jury fact-finding and the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard generally go hand in hand.\" Although the two issues often go hand in hand, they are not invariably linked. Venue, for instance, is established by a preponderance of the evidence but must be submitted to the jury when put in issue. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jackalow,</i> 66 U.S. (1 Black) 484, 487-88, 17 L.Ed. 225 (1861); <i>United States v. Perez,</i> 280 F.3d 318, 330, 333-34 (3d Cir.2002). Conversely, petty offenses are tried to the court but subject to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McFarland,</i> 445 F.3d 29, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2006).<sup>[18]</sup> Even in constitutional law, the judge/jury issue can be separated from the standard of proof issue. For example, there is no federal constitutional right to a jury trial in juvenile delinquency proceedings, <i>see </i><i>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania,</i> 403 U.S. 528, 547, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (1971), yet the charges in such proceedings <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> must nevertheless be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, <i>see </i><i>In re Winship,</i> 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). As these authorities indicate, Congress's decision to \"remove from the jury and confide to the judge\" the question of vessel status, <i>González,</i> 311 F.3d at 443, does not necessarily imply that Congress intended to lower the government's burden of proof as well. The two issues, though \"interrelated,\" <i>Sullivan v. Louisiana,</i> 508 U.S. 275, 278, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993), are ultimately separate.</p>\n<p>Finally, the majority says that the preponderance of the evidence standard \"comports with Congress' aim to facilitate enforcement.\" But, of course, the same could be said of every issue in a criminal case. Congress always and understandably wants criminals to be brought to justice. That fact is not a license to interpret every criminal statute as broadly as possible. Congress is also mindful of individual rights, international law, and the need for substantive and procedural limitations on the federal criminal power. The question in this case, as in every case, is where Congress struck the balance between those considerations and the desire to punish wrongdoers. The majority's unelaborated reference to Congress's \"aim to facilitate enforcement\" does not meaningfully advance that inquiry. To the contrary, it tends to obscure the nuanced approach that Congress took in the statute. <i>Cf. </i><i>Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. Dimension Fin. Corp.,</i> 474 U.S. 361, 374, 106 S.Ct. 681, 88 L.Ed.2d 691 (1986) (\"Invocation of the `plain purpose' of legislation at the expense of the terms of the statute itself takes no account of the processes of compromise and, in the end, prevents the effectuation of congressional intent.\").</p>\n<p>Hence, in my view, Congress's silence is evidence that it did not intend to alter the standard of proof.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Even assuming that preponderance of the evidence is the correct standard, the government did not meet that standard in this case. It was the government's burden to prove that the defendants' yola was a \"vessel without nationality.\" That statutory phrase dates to the original Marijuana on the High Seas Act, which left the term undefined. It was evidently meant to refer to vessels that would be considered stateless under international law. Congress subsequently added three specific examples of \"vessel[s] without nationality\" to the statute. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1) (quoted <i>infra.</i>) As the majority correctly holds, Congress did not intend those three examples to be exhaustive. The MDLEA extends to vessels that are considered stateless under international law, even if those vessels do not fall within one of the specifically enumerated categories.<sup>[19]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d 166, 171 (3d Cir.1994) (Alito, J.).</p>\n<p>International law, in turn, largely leaves the allocation of vessel nationality to national <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> law. Each country \"may determine for itself the conditions on which it will grant its nationality to a merchant ship, thereby accepting responsibility for it and acquiring authority over it.\"<sup>[20]</sup><i>Lauritzen v. Larsen,</i> 345 U.S. 571, 584, 73 S.Ct. 921, 97 L.Ed. 1254 (1953); <i>see also</i> Purchase of Ships of Belligerents by Neutrals, 6 Op. Att'y Gen. 638, 640 (1854) (\"The law of nations and common sense combine to require that every ship shall have a nationality, defined and evidenced in each case according to the municipal law of the particular nation to which the ship appertains.\").</p>\n<p>In some countries, the law provides that any ship meeting certain conditions (e.g., ownership by a national) is considered a national ship. <i>See</i> H. Meyers, <i>The Nationality of Ships</i> 147 (1967). In other countries, nationality must be bestowed through an affirmative act of the government. <i>Id.</i> Still other countries link nationality to registration, granting their nationality automatically to ships that are registered in accordance with the law. <i>Id.</i> Many countries, including the United States, combine elements of the different systems. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(b); Ted L. McDorman, <i>Stateless Fishing Vessels, International Law and the U.N. High Seas Fisheries Conference,</i> 25 J. Mar. L. &amp; Comm. 531, 533 (1994) (\"Practice in the United States suggests that where a vessel is not registered, the nationality of the vessel can become that of the vessel's owner.\"); <i>The Chiquita,</i> 19 F.2d 417, 418 (5th Cir.1927) (\"If [a vessel] is not properly registered, her nationality is still that of her owner.\").</p>\n<p>A vessel either has a given nationality or it does not. It is therefore incorrect to suggest, as the majority does, that whether a vessel is stateless depends upon the circumstances in which it is encountered. <i>See</i> Majority Opinion at 6 (\"The controlling question is whether <i>at the point at which the authorities confront the vessel,</i> it bears the insignia or papers of a national vessel or its master is prepared to make an affirmative and sustainable claim of nationality.\" (emphasis added)). Under international law, a stateless vessel is simply one that does not have a valid grant of nationality from any country. <i>See </i><i>Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d at 171. That may be the case if, for example, no country has ever granted the vessel nationality; if a country has canceled its grant of nationality; or if the political entity that granted the vessel nationality is not a recognized international person. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Because statelessness is the absence of nationality, the task of establishing that a vessel is genuinely stateless can \"present the difficulties often associated with proving a negative.\" <i>Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d at 171. International law deals with this problem by permitting nations to <i>deem</i> a vessel that \"repeatedly, deliberately, and successfully\" obscures its nationality to be stateless, irrespective of whether the vessel is genuinely stateless. Meyers, <i>supra,</i> at 322. In a similar vein, a vessel that claims the nationality of two or more countries according to convenience is \"assimilated to\" (in the sense of \"rendered similar to\" or \"deemed to be\") a vessel without nationality, even if it legitimately possesses a nationality. Convention on the High Seas art. 6(2). These rules operate as sanctions, effectively penalizing vessels that attempt <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> to evade law enforcement authority on the high seas.</p>\n<p>Congress took this notion of \"deemed\" statelessness a step further in the MDLEA. Under the statute, three additional categories of vessels that make false or evasive claims of nationality are deemed to be stateless:</p>\n<blockquote>(A) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge makes a claim of registry that is denied by the nation whose registry is claimed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge fails, on request of an officer of the United States authorized to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(C) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge makes a claim of registry and for which the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.</blockquote>\n<p>46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1).</p>\n<p>To summarize, international law and the MDLEA recognize two basic categories of vessels without nationality. In the first category are vessels that are genuinely stateless under international law, in the sense that they do not have a valid grant of nationality from any country. In the second category are vessels that are <i>deemed</i> to be stateless because they have attempted to obscure their nationality. I will discuss each of these categories in explaining why I do not believe the government carried its burden of proving that the defendants' yola fell within the scope of the MDLEA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Genuine Statelessness</h2>\n<p>The government argues that the yola was genuinely stateless because the defendants \"were not flying a flag, carried no documentation, and never claimed to the Coast Guard that their ship was registered in the Dominican Republic or flew a Dominican flag.\" Insofar as the government means to suggest that any vessel that fails to affirmatively signal its nationality through a flag, documents, or an oral claim of registry becomes stateless under international law, it is mistaken. Registration, documentation, and the flag are \"indicators\" of vessel nationality, but they are not sources of vessel nationality. <i>See</i> Meyers, <i>supra,</i> at 138-140; <i>see also </i><i>Lauritzen,</i> 345 U.S. at 584, 73 S.Ct. 921 (\"Nationality is <i>evidenced</i> to the world by the ship's papers and its flag.\" (emphasis added)); <i>The Mohawk,</i> 70 U.S. (3 Wall) 566, 571, 18 L.Ed. 67 (1865) (\"The purpose of a register is to declare the nationality of a vessel engaged in trade with foreign nations, and to enable her to assert that nationality wherever found.\"); Henry Wheaton, <i>Elements of International Law</i> 425 n. 163 (Richard Henry Dana, Jr., ed., 8th ed. 1866) (distinguishing between a vessel's \"ostensible nationality,\" which is indicated by its flag and documents, and its \"actual nationality, which depends on the domicile of the owner and other facts\").</p>\n<p>Under international law, \"[a] vessel may be considered as possessing the nationality of a State even though she is unregistered, possesses no documents evidencing that nationality, nor even flies the flag of that State.\"<sup>[21]</sup> N.P. Ready, <i>Ship Registration</i> 3 (3d ed.1998); <i>see also</i> McDorman, <i>supra,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> at 533 (\"Determining vessel nationality ... is not just a question of documentation of the vessel[,] and a vessel <i>literally</i> without a flag, not being a vessel registered in a country, is not necessarily stateless or without nationality.\"); <i>Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d at 172-73 (holding that it was error to instruct the jury that it could find a vessel genuinely stateless \"based on an unstructured weighing of the totality of the evidence,\" including various indicators of nationality). Even pirate ships possessing no documents and flying the flag of an unrecognized insurrectionary movement do not necessarily lose their nationality. <i>See</i> Convention on the High Seas art. 18 (\"A ship or aircraft may retain its nationality although it has become a pirate ship or aircraft. The retention or loss of nationality is determined by the law of the State from which such nationality was derived.\"); United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea art. 104, Dec. 10, 1982, S. Treaty Doc. No. 103-39, 1833 U.N.T.S. 3 (same). The question in every case turns on national law.</p>\n<p>There is a separate question of whether the absence of a flag and documentation, though not directly affecting a vessel's nationality, can provide circumstantial evidence of statelessness. I believe it can. Common sense suggests that a vessel that lacks the usual indicators of nationality is more likely to be stateless than an equivalently situated vessel possessing such indicators. <i>Cf.</i> Fed.R.Evid. 401. But even acknowledging that to be so, it does not mean that proof that a vessel lacks the usual indicators of nationality is alone sufficient to justify the inferential conclusion that the vessel is, in fact, stateless. The reasonableness of such a conclusion will depend on other factors that are particular to each case.</p>\n<p>It is not necessary to enumerate those factors comprehensively to see that such an inference is not warranted here. The yola in question was a small wooden boat equipped with an outboard motor. It undisputedly originated in the Dominican Republic and was carrying Dominican crew members. It was sighted just outside Dominican territorial waters (within the Dominican Republic's Exclusive Economic Zone) and was obviously incapable of making long international voyages. Although the vessel was not carrying documentation, \"[m]any states ... do not issue documents to ships with a tonnage below a given figure.\" Meyers, <i>supra,</i> at 160; <i>see also</i> R.R. Churchill &amp; A.V. Lowe, <i>The Law of the Sea</i> 213 n. 19 (3d ed.1999) (noting that \"a State may not require, or permit, the registration of ships below a certain size, for example, but may nonetheless regard such ships as having its nationality if they are owned by its nationals\"). Defendant Soto-Pérez testified at trial that the yola was owned by a Dominican man and was registered in some fashion with the Dominican government.</p>\n<p>All of this evidence points strongly toward Dominican nationality. The government, which bore the burden of proving that the yola was stateless, offered nothing to rebut or undermine that conclusion. It submitted no evidence regarding Dominican law on nationality, presented no statement from a Dominican official, and generally made no attempt to eliminate the Dominican Republic as the most plausible candidate for nationality. Nor did the government obtain the Dominican Republic's consent to prosecution, <i>see</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(1)(C), which could have provided a fallback position in the event that the evidence of statelessness proved deficient.<sup>[22]</sup> The district court, for its part, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> appears to have shifted the burden of proof to the defendants. At one point, the judge told defense counsel: \"You could have brought the owner of the boat to testify. You could have done that. He would have told you yes, this was my boat. I bought it. I have pictures of the boat. Here they are. I have it registered. Brought certified papers of the registry. All those things could have been done.\" Needless to say, it was not the defendants' burden to prove that their boat fell outside the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p>Given all the circumstances, I believe it was erroneous for the district court to conclude, based solely on the lack of a flag and documentation, that the defendants' vessel was genuinely stateless. Those factors would almost certainly have justified the detention and boarding of the yola, which may be based on a \"reasonable suspicion\" that a vessel is stateless.<sup>[23]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Williams,</i> 617 F.2d 1063, 1082 (5th Cir.1980) (en banc); Proposed Interdiction of Haitian Flag Vessels, 5 Op. O.L.C. 242, 243 n. 4 (1981) (\"Ships flying no flag may also be stopped to determine if they are stateless.\"). But the question of whether there are reasonable grounds for detaining and searching a vessel is \"separate\" from the question of whether the vessel is truly stateless and, as such, falls within the ambit of the MDLEA. <i>United States v. Potes,</i> 880 F.2d 1475, 1478 (1st Cir.1989). On the facts of this case, I do not believe the government satisfied its burden of proving the latter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Deemed Statelessness</h2>\n<p>The question, then, is whether the yola can be <i>deemed</i> to be stateless. The majority concludes that it can. My colleagues rely primarily on the provision extending the MDLEA to \"a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge fails, on request of an officer of the United States authorized to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel.\" 46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1)(B).<sup>[24]</sup> Pursuant to the text of that provision, the failure to claim nationality has legal consequences only in specific circumstances: when a specified individual <i>aboard</i> the vessel fails to respond to a federal law enforcement officer's request for a claim of nationality.</p>\n<p>Here, however, no federal officer requested the yola's nationality while the defendants were still on board the vessel. Officer Young questioned the defendants after they were picked up by the Dominican Coast Guard. Among other things, he asked \"if anybody would like to speak for the boat and give [him] a claim of nationality.\" The defendants \"shook their heads no, and actually did not give [him] a full <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> response.\"<sup>[25]</sup> I will assume that this exchange would ordinarily constitute a request for, and a failure to make, a claim of nationality under the MDLEA. The issue remaining is whether the statute's requirement that the questioning take place \"aboard\" the suspect vessel includes within its scope questioning that took place \"aboard\" the Dominican cutter.</p>\n<p>The majority concludes that \"aboard\" as used in section 70502(d)(1)(B) is sufficiently elastic to embrace the questioning that took place here, despite my colleagues' recognition that the circumstances fall outside the MDLEA if \"aboard\" is given its common meaning of \"on board.\"<sup>[26]</sup> In essence, the majority concludes that \"near\" the yola is close enough to \"aboard\" the yola in light of the other indicators of statelessness, including the absence of a flag or registry papers and the crew's failure to make an affirmative claim of nationality.</p>\n<p>But a court does not have license to expand the scope of a criminal statute merely because it believes that doing so is consistent with Congress's law enforcement objectives. In enacting the MDLEA, Congress was acting against the backdrop of international law. As noted earlier, the international standard for deeming statelessness requires proof that a vessel \"repeatedly, deliberately, and successfully\" obscured its nationality. Meyers, <i>supra,</i> at 322. The MDLEA criteria for deeming statelessness, allowing such a determination based on a single failure to respond, are significantly less demanding and may in fact overstep international norms. <i>See</i> Eugene Kontorovich, <i>Beyond the Article I Horizon: Congress's Enumerated Powers and Universal Jurisdiction over Drug Crimes,</i> 93 Minn. L.Rev. 1191, 1228 (2009) (\"[T]he MDLEA's definition of statelessness goes far beyond what is recognized by international custom or convention.\"). Although Congress has the prerogative to go beyond the limits of international law, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Bradley, <i>supra,</i> at 331 (\"Congress is free to override the limitations of international law, including the international law of prescriptive jurisdiction, when enacting a criminal statute.\"), we exceed our authority if we go beyond <i>Congress</i> in this sensitive realm.</p>\n<p>There is every reason to conclude that Congress did not include the word \"aboard\" in section 70502(d)(1)(B) casually. To the contrary, the boarding of vessels by law enforcement officials is a significant step, and allowing authorities to board for limited investigatory purposes is a traditional \"exception to the principle of noninterference on the high seas.\" <i>United States v. Postal,</i> 589 F.2d 862, 870 (5th Cir.1979); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Ricardo,</i> 619 F.2d 1124, 1130 n. 4 (5th Cir.1980). The doctrine of international common law known as the \"right of visit,\" or the \"right of approach,\" permits scrutiny of the conduct or nationality of suspicious vessels through inquiry that culminates in an \"examination on board the ship.\" Convention <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> on the High Seas art. 22;<sup>[27]</sup><i>see also, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Romero-Galue,</i> 757 F.2d 1147, 1149 n. 3 (11th Cir.1985) (\"The `right of approach' is a doctrine of international maritime common law that bestows a nation's warship with the authority to hail and board an unidentified vessel to ascertain its nationality.\"); <i>United States v. Petrulla,</i> 457 F.Supp. 1367, 1372 n. 1 (M.D.Fla.1978) (\"[T]he right of approach to determine nationality has long been recognized.\").<sup>[28]</sup> Likewise, 14 U.S.C. § 89(a) gives the Coast Guard authority to board any vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to \"address inquiries to those on board, examine the ship's documents and papers, and examine, inspect, and search the vessel.\" <i>See </i><i>Williams,</i> 617 F.2d at 1076-77 (\"Congress, in enacting section 89(a), created an exception to the principle of non interference that is analogous to the exceptions contained in article 22.\").</p>\n<p>Section 70502(d)(1)(B) thus exists within a larger context of maritime law in which officers are given limited authority to board vessels to complete their investigations. As I have noted, the authority conferred by that provision's language is, arguably, already beyond the bounds of international law. I can see no justification for broadening the statute's scope even further by ignoring its literal terms. If the majority were correct that failure to respond to questioning on an adjacent vessel is equivalent to questioning \"aboard\" the target vessel, what principle would distinguish inquiry at a Coast Guard station located just ashore? In such circumstances, the limited \"right to visit\" becomes a license to conduct questioning of a ship's crew wherever convenient for the authorities. In my view, neither scenario falls within a provision that deems a vessel stateless based on a specific interaction that occurs \"aboard\" that vessel.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>Abiding by the plain language of the statute need not frustrate Congress's objective to prosecute maritime drug trafficking nor undermine law enforcement efforts. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> In this case, for example, the Coast Guard could likely have brought the defendants within the scope of the MDLEA by obtaining the consent of the Dominican Republic, the yola's apparent country of nationality. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(1)(C). Alternatively, the government could have alleged that the yola was either a Dominican vessel or a stateless vessel and further investigated its nationality after the defendants' arrest. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Greer,</i> 285 F.3d 158, 175 (2d Cir.2002) (holding that the MDLEA's jurisdictional element may be satisfied by consent obtained \"any time before trial\"); <i>United States v. Bustos-Useche,</i> 273 F.3d 622, 627 (5th Cir.2001) (same); <i>United States v. Cardales,</i> 168 F.3d 548, 552 (1st Cir.1999) (finding jurisdictional requirement met where consent provided after Coast Guard's boarding of ship).<sup>[30]</sup> That the government failed to pursue those avenues in this case does not justify extending the scope of a criminal statute beyond its plain terms.<sup>[31]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>The issues raised in this appeal are difficult, and I respect the majority's thoughtful attempt to resolve them. In the end, however, I fear that the majority's focus on Congress's \"aim to facilitate enforcement\" has overshadowed the considerations of fairness and international law that counsel restraint in interpreting the MDLEA. The majority's interpretation extends United States drug laws to circumstances that Congress did not contemplate and that likely exceed the bounds of international law as well. In addition, the majority has lowered the traditional standard of proof for finding guilt. I would not reach either of those results in the absence of a clear statement that Congress intended its penal laws to reach so broadly.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The area is outside Dominican territorial waters and considered the \"high seas\" for purposes of the Coast Guard's enforcement jurisdiction, 14 U.S.C. § 89(a) (2006); 33 C.F.R. § 2.32(c) (2009), although within the Dominican Republic's exclusive economic zone, <i>id.</i> § 2.30(b).</p>\n<p>[2]  The same prohibition applies to such conduct by anyone onboard \"a vessel of the United States,\" <i>id.</i> § 70503(a)(1), or \"any vessel if the individual is a citizen of the United States or a resident alien of the United States,\" <i>id.</i> § 70503(a)(2); but neither of these conditions was satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p>[3]  The term \"claim of nationality or registry\" in subsection (d) is defined in subsection (e) such that it\n</p>\n<p>includes only</p>\n<p>(1) possession on board the vessel and production of documents evidencing the vessel's nationality as provided in article 5 of the 1958 Convention on the High Seas;</p>\n<p>(2) flying its nation's ensign or flag; or</p>\n<p>(3) a verbal claim of nationality or registry by the master or individual in charge of the vessel.</p>\n<p>46 U.S.C. § 70502(e).</p>\n<p>[4]  \"Jurisdiction\" in this context refers to the enforcement reach of the statutenot federal court subject-matter jurisdiction, which extends to any federal felony. <i>United States v. González,</i> 311 F.3d 440, 443 (1st Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 826, 124 S.Ct. 47, 157 L.Ed.2d 49 (2003). That reach was limited by Congress to minimize conflict with foreign nations who might also assert rights to regulate. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 523 F.3d 1, 22 (1st Cir.) (separate opinion of Lynch &amp; Howard, JJ.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 208, 172 L.Ed.2d 168 (2008).</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>See </i><i>Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 523 F.3d at 20-22 (separate opinion of Lynch &amp; Howard, JJ.)

Perlaza,</i> 439 F.3d 1149, 1167 (9th Cir.2006). In criminal cases, jury fact-finding and the beyond-reasonable-doubt standard generally go hand in hand. <i>Sullivan v. Louisiana,</i> 508 U.S. 275, 278, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993).</p>\n<p>[6]  <i>See also</i> Anderson, <i>Jurisdiction over Stateless Vessels on the High Seas: An Appraisal Under Domestic and International Law,</i> 13 J. Mar. L. &amp; Com. 323, 341 (1982). On the traditional right to approach a suspect vessel to verify its nationality, see 1 Oppenheim, <i>supra,</i> § 266, at 604.</p>\n<p>[7]  The word can also mean \"alongside of,\" especially in nautical contexts, and the defendants were arguably alongside of the yola when they declined to make a claim of nationality. <i>See Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language</i> 4 (2002); <i>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language</i> 5 (2d ed. unabr.1987).</p>\n<p>[8]  The defendants argue on appeal that ion scans are unreliable \"[a]s a matter of law\" and offend due process, but they provide no citation or developed argument, so the objection is waived. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).</p>\n<p>[9]  Nations may also prescribe law with respect to a narrow class of universally condemned activities, such as piracy. <i>Restatement (Third)</i> § 404.</p>\n<p>[10]  A number of sources say that vessel nationality provides the <i>exclusive</i> basis for exercising prescriptive jurisdiction over a vessel on the high seas. <i>See</i> Convention on the High Seas art. 6, Apr. 29, 1958, 13 U.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82; <i>McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras,</i> 372 U.S. 10, 21, 83 S.Ct. 671, 9 L.Ed.2d 547 (1963); R.R. Churchill &amp; A.V. Lowe, <i>The Law of the Sea</i> 208 (3d ed.1999). However, Congress, in enacting the Marijuana on the High Seas Act, apparently viewed vessel nationality as a supplement to the traditional bases of prescriptive jurisdiction. The <i>Restatement</i> concurs in that view. <i>See Restatement (Third)</i> § 402 reporters' note 4 (characterizing vessel nationality as \"an addition to the general bases of jurisdiction set forth in this section\").</p>\n<p>[11]  Although Congress could enact criminal laws that go beyond the limitations of international law, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Curtis A. Bradley, <i>Universal Jurisdiction and U.S. Law,</i> 2001 U. Chi. Legal F. 323, 331 (2001), its intention at the time, as indicated above, apparently was to stay within those limits. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Hensel,</i> 699 F.2d 18, 27 (1st Cir.1983) (\"Congress wished to authorize the search of vessels on the high seas to the extent such searches conformed to international law, but there is no indication that it wished to go further.\").</p>\n<p>[12]  Other statutes criminalizing extraterritorial conduct have followed a similar approach. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2237 (failure to heave to, obstruction of boarding, providing false information); <i>id.</i> § 2339B (providing material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations); <i>id.</i> § 2339C (financing terrorism).</p>\n<p>[13]  Consent is a well-established basis of jurisdiction to prescribe under international law. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 843 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>[14]  The statute provided that a \"vessel without nationality\" includes:\n</p>\n<p>(A) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry, which claim is denied by the flag nation whose registry is claimed; and</p>\n<p>(B) any vessel aboard which the master or person in charge fails, upon request of an officer of the United States empowered to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel.</p>\n<p>Pub.L. No. 99-640, 100 Stat. 3545.</p>\n<p>[15]  The new provision added to the definition \"a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.\"</p>\n<p>[16]  Our court was not alone in that interpretation. \"Prior to 1996, there was a consensus among the circuits that `the jurisdictional requirement... is an element of the crime charged and therefore must be decided by the jury.'\" <i>United States v. Moreno-Morillo,</i> 334 F.3d 819, 828 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v. Medjuck,</i> 48 F.3d 1107, 1110 (9th Cir. 1995)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Bustos-Useche,</i> 273 F.3d 622, 626 (5th Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Medina,</i> 90 F.3d 459, 464 (11th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p>[17]  Although vessel status is a substantive issue in that it relates to \"the reach and application\" of the statute, <i>González,</i> 311 F.3d at 443, it is not an element of the offense. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a); <i>United States v. Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 523 F.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[18]  Other judge-determined issues are subject to higher and lower standards of proof. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Huddleston v. United States,</i> 485 U.S. 681, 690, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988) (noting that a court resolves a question of relevancy conditioned on fact by deciding \"whether the jury could reasonably find the conditional fact\"); <i>United States v. Ruiz-Gaxiola,</i> 623 F.3d 684, 691-93 (9th Cir.2010) (holding that facts justifying forced administration of antipsychotic medication must be established by clear and convincing evidence).</p>\n<p>[19]  The MDLEA provides that \"[a] failure to comply with international law does not divest a court of jurisdiction and is not a defense to a proceeding under this chapter.\" 46 U.S.C. § 70505. That provision simply means that international law does not supply an independent basis for defending against an MDLEA prosecution. To the extent that international law informs the scope of the statute itself, it must necessarily be considered in determining whether a defendant's conduct falls within the statute. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Alvarez-Machain,</i> 504 U.S. 655, 666, 112 S.Ct. 2188, 119 L.Ed.2d 441 (1992) (distinguishing between the invocation of international law as \"an independent basis for the right respondent asserts not to be tried in the United States\" and the invocation of international law to \"inform the interpretation of the Treaty terms\").</p>\n<p>[20]  A vessel that has been granted the nationality of a particular country is often said to sail \"under the flag\" of that country (the \"flag state\") or to be entitled to \"fly the flag\" of that country. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Convention on the High Seas art. 5, Apr. 29, 1958, 13 U.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82. To prevent confusion with the national flag that is often flown from the stern of a ship, I avoid those metaphors in favor of the term \"nationality.\"</p>\n<p>[21]  One commentator colorfully illustrates this principle: \"According to international law the flying of the national flag was never the cause ofor the condition for[nationality]. When the last bunting on board was blown to tatters, this never had radical legal consequences, nor had the hoisting of the flag.\" Meyers, <i>supra,</i> at 162.</p>\n<p>[22]  The majority's suggestion that the transfer of the crew by the Dominican Coast Guard may have constituted informal consent is interesting, but it is not an appropriate basis for affirming the judgment in this case. Consent was not charged in the indictment, argued below, or raised on appeal.</p>\n<p>[23]  As it happens, the Dominican Republic has given the United States blanket authorization to board and search any Dominican vessel on the high seas \"suspected of illicit traffic\" in drugs. Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Dominican Republic Concerning Maritime Counter-Drug Operations, U.S.-Dom. Rep., art. 10, Mar. 23, 1995, T.I.A.S. No. 12620. However, the Dominican Republic has retained the \"primary right\" to prosecute the individuals on board such a vessel. <i>Id.</i> art. 11.</p>\n<p>[24]  The majority also suggests that the defendants' failure to make an \"affirmative claim of nationality\" is on its own enough to bring them within the scope of the MDLEA. That suggestion finds no support in the statute, which addresses the failure to claim nationality in a separate section that is inapplicable here. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>[25]  Officer Young further testified: \"I asked who was the captain of the vessel they were on or the senior person, and they responded that there was no single person in charge.... Because I could not get one individual to make a claim for the vessel, I then questioned what was the nationality of the personnel. And they had all told me and informed me that they were from the Dominican Republic. I asked if the boat had come from the Dominican Republic as well, and they, in turn, agreed.\"</p>\n<p>[26]  The majority observes in a footnote that the dictionary definitions of \"aboard\" include \"alongside of.\" As described <i>infra,</i> however, the international law context leaves no doubt that Congress had the ordinary usage of the word in mind. <i>See infra.</i></p>\n<p>[27]  Article 22 of the Convention codifies the common law doctrine and states, in part:\n</p>\n<p>1. Except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters a foreign merchant ship on the high seas is not justified in boarding her unless there is reasonable ground for suspecting:</p>\n<p>(a) That the ship is engaged in piracy; or</p>\n<p>(b) That the ship is engaged in the slave trade; or</p>\n<p>(c) That, though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship.</p>\n<p>2. In the cases provided for in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, the warship may proceed to verify the ship's right to fly its flag. To this end, it may send a boat under the command of an officer to the suspected ship. If suspicion remains after the documents have been checked, it may proceed to a further examination on board the ship, which must be carried out with all possible consideration.</p>\n<p>A Coast Guard cutter is considered a \"warship\" for purposes of this provision. <i>Postal,</i> 589 F.2d at 871 n. 13 (citing Convention on the High Seas art. 8(2)); <i>United States v. Cortes,</i> 588 F.2d 106, 110 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p>[28]  Officer Young testified that the yola was boarded pursuant to a right of visit.</p>\n<p>[29]  The majority's observation that Congress used the word \"includes\" when it listed specific instances of deemed statelessness does not help its argument that section 70502(d)(1) reaches the circumstances here. To construe the word \"aboard\" as the majority proposes is effectively to nullify a limitation on the scope of the statute as enacted. The rules of statutory construction do not permit us to rewrite the statute by ignoring a word chosen by Congress. <i>See </i><i>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</i> 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979) (\"In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\").</p>\n<p>[30]  Indeed, as noted <i>supra,</i> the United States has authority to search any Dominican vessel on the high seas suspected of involvement in drug trafficking. Because the Dominican Republic retains the right to prosecute individuals for such crimes, the United States presumably would transfer the custody of any arrested persons upon request from the Dominican government if the vessel were determined to be Dominican.</p>\n<p>[31]  Of course, federal officers may encounter scenarios in which an overly rigid reading of the statute would truly frustrate congressional purposes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d at 174 (\"By clear implication, ... [the failure to claim nationality] provision applies when the master of a ship flees and leaves no one in charge....\"). This case does not present such a situation.</p>\n\n</div>",

Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, BOUDIN and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This appeal by several defendants convicted of drug traffickingEpifanio Matos-Luchi, Manolo Soto-Perez, and Ramon Carrasco-Carrascorequires the interpretation of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (\"MDLEA\"), 46 U.S.C. § 70501 <i>et seq.</i> (2006), which <i>inter alia</i> delineates federal enforcement authority over drug crimes carried on at sea outside U.S. territorial limits. The factual background and proceedings in the district court are as follows.</p>\n<p>In May 2007, Petty Officer Richard Young and a team of five other U.S. Coast Guard personnel were stationed on the HMS <i>Ocean,</i> a British aircraft carrier, to assist with law enforcement efforts in the Carribean Sea. On May 12, the Coast Guard team deployed in a helicopter to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2</span> investigate a low-flying airplane spotted in the vicinity; from the air, they saw the plane drop several bale-shaped packages into the sea about thirty to thirty-five miles from the coast of the Dominican Republic.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>A small boat waiting nearbya twenty to twenty-five foot fishing \"yola\" propelled by an outboard motor and allegedly crewed by the three defendantsthen approached the drop site and began to retrieve the bales. The officers suspected drug trafficking and descended in the helicopter. The boat crew jettisoned the bales and fled. After giving chase for nearly an hour, the Coast Guard helicopter returned to the drop site to retrieve the bales, which proved to contain packages of cocaine.</p>\n<p>While the helicopter retrieved the drugs, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection airplane followed the yola as it proceeded north towards the Dominican Republic. The boat experienced engine problems and halted about twenty-five miles from the Dominican coast. At the request of the U.S. Customs officials, a Dominican Coast Guard cutter sailed out to retrieve the yola and its crew. The three crew members were taken on board the cutter and the yola was tied to its stern.</p>\n<p>Later that evening, Young and two others traveled from the HMS <i>Ocean</i> to the Dominican cutter where, with the permission of the Dominican authorities, they questioned the three defendants who now were on board the cutter. Young later testified that when questioned, Matos, Soto and Carrasco declined to make a claim of nationality for the yola:</p>\n<blockquote>I asked ... who was the captain of the vessel they were on or the senior person in charge of the boat, and they responded there was no single person in charge. Since I could not determine if there was a captain of the vessel, I asked if anybody would like to speak for the boat and give me a claim of nationality. And they shook their heads no, and actually did not give me a full response. Because I could not get one individual to make a claim for the vessel, I then questioned what was the nationality of the personnel. And they had all told me and informed me that they were from the Dominican Republic. I asked if the boat had come from the Dominican Republic as well, and they, in turn, agreed.</blockquote>\n<p>While Young interrogated the yola crew, another Coast Guard officer boarded the yola, now tied to the stern of the cutter. No ensign, flag, registration, or other evidence of the vessel's nationality was found on board. The U.S. Coast Guard crew were instructed by their superiors to detain the defendants, who were transferred to the HMS <i>Ocean</i> and then brought to Puerto Rico for prosecution in federal district court.</p>\n<p>The defendants were charged by indictment with violations of the MDLEA: one count of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute, 46 U.S.C. § 70503, and one count of aiding and abetting that crime, 18 U.S.C. § 2 (2006), all while on board a \"vessel without nationality\" and so within the enforcement authority of the United States, 46 U.S.C. §§ 70502(c)(1)(A), 70503(a)(1). The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment \"for lack of jurisdiction,\" arguing that there was no proof that they were on board a \"vessel without nationality\" as alleged in the indictment. The district court held that motion in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> abeyance, and the defendants proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p>When the government rested its case in chief, the defendants sought a judgment of acquittal from the court, repeating that there was no proof that they were on board a \"vessel without nationality.\" The court denied the motion. The most extensive explanation given by the judge, provided in response to defense counsel's repeated efforts to have the jury instructed on the issue, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Title [46], the law defines a vessel without nationality. And look at this. A vessel on which the master or individual in chargeyou need a master or individual in charge, to begin withfails on request of an officer of the United States, authorized to enforce applicable United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And then what happens on top of that, you have a vessel that is in international waters, no written registration on the outside. No name, no flying flag, no nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I believe it is entirely up to me to make a determination as to jurisdiction, and I'm convinced that there is jurisdiction, so I cannot ask the jury to make that determination.</blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, the jury found the defendants guilty as charged of possession with intent to distribute the seized drugs. Conformably with the statute, the issue of whether the vessel was without nationality was not submitted to the jury. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a). Based on the weight of the cocaine recoveredwhich was 386 kilogramsthe defendants were later each sentenced to 235 months' imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>The most abstruse issue in the case, with which we begin, is whether the defendants' possession of the cocaine with intent to distribute occurred on board \"a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1). To put the issue in context requires an understanding of the design and background of the MDLEAa statute initially enacted in 1986 as 46 U.S.C.app. § 1903, <i>see</i> Pub.L. No. 99-570, § 3202, 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-95 to -97 (1986), and later relocated to its present code sections, 46 U.S.C. §§ 70501-70507, <i>see</i> Pub.L. No. 109-304, § 10(2), 120 Stat. 1485, 1685-89 (2006).</p>\n<p>Invoking its constitutional power \"[t]o define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas,\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 10, Congress in the MDLEA made it unlawful <i>inter alia</i> for anyone to</p>\n<blockquote>knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance on board ... a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States... even though the act is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p>46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)-(b).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Underscoring its aim to reach broadly, Congress defined \"a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" to include six categories of boats (listed in full in an appendix to this decision)first among them \"a vessel without nationality,\" 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> In turn, \"a vessel without nationality\" is defined to \"include[]\" the following:</p>\n<blockquote>(A) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge makes a claim of registry that is denied by the nation whose registry is claimed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge fails, on request of an officer of the United States authorized to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(C) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge makes a claim of registry for which the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.</blockquote>\n<p>46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1).</p>\n<p>That the listed examples do not exhaust the scope of section 70502(d) is confirmed by Congress' contrasting use of the phrase \"includes only\" in a related provision,<sup>[3]</sup> by its evident and explicit attempts to sweep quite broadly, <i>see, e.g.,</i> S. Rep. 99-530, at 15-16, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5986 (1986), and by relevant precedent, <i>United States v. Rosero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684088\"><a href=\"/opinion/684088/united-states-v-marco-antonio-copete-rosero-in-no-93-7600-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span>, 170 (3d Cir.1994) (Alito, J.). At the very least, Congress intended to include in section 70502(d), in addition to the specific examples given, those vessels that could be considered stateless under customary international law. <i>Id.</i> at 170-71; <i>see also</i> H.R.Rep. No. 96-323, at 23-24 (1979) (discussing predecessor statute).</p>\n<p>Congress' intent to reach broadly was reconfirmed in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-324, § 1138, 110 Stat. 3901, 3988-89, which amended the MDLEA by providing that the \"jurisdiction\" of the United States over a vessel under the MDLEA was \"not an element of the offense\" but a matter to be determined \"solely by the trial judge,\" <i>id.</i> § 1138(a)(5) (now codified at 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a)), and that a defendant had no standing to claim that enforcement violated \"international law\"reserving such objections only to foreign nations, <i>id.</i> § 1138(a)(4) (now codified at 46 U.S.C. § 70505).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Against this background, the district court's determination that the defendants' yola was \"a vessel without nationality\" within the meaning of the MDLEA was correct. This is so regardless of whether that finding is to be made by a preponderance of the evidenceas one of our earlier decisions implies, <i>Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 523 F.3d at 20 (separate opinion of Lynch &amp; Howard, JJ.)or beyond a reasonable doubt. Indeed, virtually none of the raw facts bearing on the reach of the statute is disputed; the problem is primarily one of interpreting the statute.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Still, the burden of proof question is likely to be a recurring one for district courts within the circuit. In our view, Congress intended it to be a preliminary issue, like venue and other judge-determined issues, to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. In <i>González,</i> 311 F.3d at 443, we likened U.S. jurisdiction over a vessel to statutory language that signals Congress' invocation of its own authority, like \"affects interstate commerce\"; but unlike other such \"jurisdictional hooks\" decided by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the reach of the statute in this case is not an element of the offense, 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a).</p>\n<p>Our readingrequiring proof only to a preponderanceis common to many judge-determined issues, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v.

Defendants raise no constitutional objection on this issue, and we see none.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Turning now to the issue of the yola as a stateless vessel, viewed in part retrospectively, the boat had various links to the Dominican Republic. The crew members were Dominicans and the small vessel was likely headed there before its engine troubles and subsequent interception by the Dominican Coast Guard. At trial one defendant said that the vessel was registered there in some fashion. But neither the MDLEA nor international law limits U.S. enforcement authority merely because the vessel has associations with another state.</p>\n<p>Under international law, every vessel must sail under the flag of one and only one state; those that sail under no flag or more than one flag enjoy no legal protection. 1 L. Oppenheim, <i>International Law</i> § 261, at 595-96 (H. Lauterpacht ed., 8th ed.1955); <i>see also</i> Convention on the High Seas art. 6, Apr. 29, 1958, 13 U.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82; <i>United States v. Victoria,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524619\"><a href=\"/opinion/524619/united-states-v-luis-alberto-victoria/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span>, 1010-11 (1st Cir.1989). By custom, a vessel claims nationality by flying the flag of the nation with which it is affiliated or carrying papers showing it to be registered with that nation. 1 Oppenheim, <i>supra,</i> §§ 260-261, at 594-96. Without a flag or papers, a vessel may also traditionally make an oral claim of nationality when a proper demand is madea pattern the MDLEA follows. <i>See supra</i> note 3 (quoting 46 U.S.C. § 70502(e)).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> Although enforcement jurisdiction presumptively lies with the flag state, 1 Oppenheim, <i>supra,</i> § 266, at 603, \"[i]t is not enough that a vessel have a nationality; she must claim it and be in a position to provide evidence of it.\" Anderson, <i>supra</i> note 6, at 341. Anderson, <i>id.</i> at 336-37, pertinently quotes a Privy Council judgment:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he freedom of the open sea, whatever those words may connote, is a freedom of ships which fly, and are entitled to fly, the flag of a State.... Their Lordships would accept as a valid statement of international law, the following passage from Oppenheim's International Law...: \"In the interest of order on the open sea, a vessel not sailing under the maritime flag of a State enjoys no protection whatever....\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Molvan v. Att'y-Gen. for Palestine,</i> [1948] A.C. 351 (P.C.) 369-70; <i>see also</i> 1 Oppenheim, <i>supra,</i> § 261, at 595.</p>\n<p>The MDLEA follows this approach, one might say, energetically. Section 70502(d) \"includes\" in the phrase \"vessel without nationality\" those ships for which a claim of nationality is made but rejected or not backed up by the nation invoked, 46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1)(A), (C), <i>or</i> those \"aboard which the master of individual in charge\" fails on request \"to make a claim of nationality or registration\" for the vessel, <i>id.</i> § 70502(d)(1)(B). In our case, the defendants when questioned by the U.S. Coast Guard refused to make a claim of nationality for the yola.</p>\n<p>That questioning was aboard the Dominican cutter rather than the defendants' yola and so arguably does not fit within the language of section 70502(d)(1)(B)at least if \"aboard\" is given its common meaning of \"on board.\"<sup>[7]</sup> But neither \"aboard\" the yola, nor adjacent to it on the cutter, did any crew member make an affirmative claim of nationality for the vessel, nor did the yola fly a flag or carry registry papers issued by any state. Under both the statute and international law, this is more than enough to \"include\" the yola as a vessel \"without nationality\" within the meaning of the MDLEA even if it is merely similar to and not within one of the specific examples given in the statute.</p>\n<p>Practically every vessel, including the legendary Flying Dutchman, has links with some country; but the stateless vessel concept in the MDLEA and in international law is designed <i>prudentially.</i> The controlling question is whether at the point at which the authorities confront the vessel, it bears the insignia or papers of a national vessel or its master is prepared to make an affirmative and sustainable claim of nationality. To read the MDLEA more restrictively would mean that the master and crew need only carry no papers and jump overboard to avoid having their vessel classed as stateless. <i>Cf. </i><i>González,</i> 311 F.3d at 449 (Torruella, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p>The defendants are not entitled to raise a violation of international law as an objection, <i>see</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70505, but in any case the MDLEA does not conflict with international law. For international law too treats the \"stateless vessel\" concept as informed by the need for effective enforcement. Thus, a vessel may be deemed \"stateless,\" and subject to the enforcement jurisdiction of any nation on the scene, if it fails to display or carry insignia of nationality and seeks to avoid national identification. This occurs</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> if a \"ship\" repeatedly refuses, without reasonable excuse, to reveal its allocation [of nationality]. If no registration number is visible and no other indicator [of nationality] can be discerned, the cognoscibility is already demonstrably insufficient, and interference will then often be justifiable.... From the basic design of [the law of sea] and from the place the institution here called allocation occupies in it already it may be concluded that a \"ship\" which obscures the cognoscibility of its allocation repeatedly, deliberately, and successfully may be treated as stateless.</blockquote>\n<p>H. Meyers, <i>The Nationality of Ships</i> 322 (1967)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>In sum, the instances specified by Congresspertinently, the refusal \"aboard\" the vessel to claim nationality, 46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1)(B)are not departures from international law but merely part of a pattern consistent with it; and when Congress used the word \"includes\" in listing specific instances, it allowed for reasonable extrapolation to functionally similar instancesincluding a refusal by the crew to claim nationality that happens to occur aboard a cutter which has the subject \"vessel\" in tow.</p>\n<p>The MDLEA was responding to repeatedly frustrated efforts to prosecute maritime drug trafficking. Anderson, <i>supra</i> note 6, at 325-27 (describing enforcement history). The statute's provisions dovetail: a refusal to claim nationality renders the unflagged vessel stateless and so within federal jurisdiction, while a supportable claim of nationality allows the federal authorities to seek jurisdiction by consent of the flag nation, <i>e.g.,</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(1)(C). Congress did not expect courts to render a cramped reading of the statute.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we need not decide whether (in the alternative) the transfer of the crew by the Dominican Coast Guard constituted \"consent\" by the Dominican Republic to federal enforcement. Consent would satisfy the MDLEA, 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(1)(C) (consent of flag state); <i>id.</i> § 70502(c)(1)(E) (consent of state in whose territorial waters vessel is found), and accord with international law, <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503769\"><a href=\"/opinion/503769/united-states-v-hernando-robinson-united-states-of-america-v-jorge/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Whether such informal consent is enough may be an open question. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Matos, Soto and Carrasco also raise a host of other claims on appealall requiring less discussion than the authority question. Our decision has thus far assumed thatas the jury necessarily foundthe defendants <i>were</i> the crew first sighted by the helicopter and seen to throw overboard bales that were recovered and found to contain cocaine. The defendants say that the evidence for this identification was insufficient.</p>\n<p>The defendants stress that the Dominican cutter that retrieved them had already intercepted and detained a second yola, with a crew of two. The defendants argue that the government's evidence was insufficient to prove that they were on the yola seen gathering drugs rather than on this second, innocent yola, because Officer Young testified at trial that the three defendants \"could be\" the same three persons that he observed from his helicopter. The argument was preserved in a motion for acquittal, so our review is <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202407\"><a href=\"/opinion/202407/united-states-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 13-14 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a rational jury could easily have found the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Although no single witness had a continuous view of the yola from the time <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> the boat was first spotted until the moment it was apprehended by the Dominican cutter, there was abundant evidence from which to identify the defendants as the crew-members and the evidence is not less powerful because some of it rested upon reasonable inference rather than eye-witness identification. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Santana-Rosa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197726\"><a href=\"/opinion/197726/united-states-v-santana-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span>, 866 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>The evidence at trial included testimony from Officer Young that the defendants' age and build matched the three persons observed on the yola; multiple videos and photos of the yola from which the jury could infer the same; ion scans of cocaine residue on the skin and clothing of the defendants;<sup>[8]</sup> and testimony from the lieutenant of the Dominican cutter than the two-man yola crew and three-man yola crew were segregated on his boat and thus unlikely to be mixed up.</p>\n<p>The defendants also raise two other arguments under the heading of their identification challenge but which in truth present different legal questions. First, they claim that the government denied them a fair trial by failing to produce the only witness allegedly in a position to settle the identification issue, a Dominican official named Carmelo Matos Rodriguez. Government <i>interference</i> in the production of witnesses helpful to the defendant may in some circumstances preclude a fair trial, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Castro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197657\"><a href=\"/opinion/197657/united-states-v-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 232 (1st Cir.1997), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But the <i>defendants</i> incorrectly identified Matos Rodriguez as a member of the \"Dominican Coast Guard\" when he was in fact with the Dominican equivalent of the Drug Enforcement Agency. When the error was discovered and Matos Rodriguez located, there was insufficient time to get him the necessary documents to travel to the United States. The defendants never sought a continuance.</p>\n<p>Defendants seem to claim, at least at oral argument, that they were <i>affirmatively</i> misled by the government into believing that Matos Rodriguez would appearonly to be told the contrary on the first day of trial. We ordered supplemental briefing from the defendants on this specific issue after argument, instructing them to \"provide relevant transcript and record references.\" Instead, they submitted a brief that relies entirely on alleged pretrial conversations and affidavits from their own employeesnone of which is part of the record on appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 10(a).</p>\n<p>Second, defendants assail the instructions given to the jury on identification during deliberations, after the jury sent a note requesting clarification on the issue; they complain that the trial judge alluded to hypothetical testimony by a witness who looks at a lineup and says \"I think it's number two.\" Their position is that \"I think\" is too equivocal for proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that the instruction would have misled the jury into thinking that a doubtful identification was sufficient to convict.</p>\n<p>No objection was made to the instruction at the time it was made, so it is reviewed only for plain error, <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> <i>States v.

The court correctly instructed the jury on the <i>types</i> of evidence it could consider and reminded the jury at defense counsel's requestthat identification had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Nothing in the instructions suggested that a doubtful identification was sufficient.</p>\n<p>Next, defendants argue that the evidence was insufficient as to mens rea; they claim thateven if they were the persons on board the yola observed retrieving the airdropped balesthere was insufficient evidence that they knew the bales contained contraband as opposed to innocent cargo. Again, the argument was preserved in a motion for acquittal, so our review is <i>de novo,</i> taking all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the government. <i>United States v.

The majority, after concluding that the government need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a vessel is \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" holds that the government met its burden in this case because it established that the defendants' small fishing boat was a \"vessel without nationality\" within the meaning of the statute. <i>See id.</i> § 70502(c) (defining \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" to include \"a vessel without nationality\"). I disagree with both of those conclusions. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The MDLEA was one of a series of steps Congress took in the 1980s and 1990s to extend the reach of the federal drug laws beyond the territory of the United States. Because the function and meaning of the critical phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" is not self-evident, it is important to understand the MDLEA's design and background. I therefore begin by reviewing the legislative context giving rise to the statute and its jurisdictional requirement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Marijuana on the High Seas Act</h2>\n<p>Before 1980, maritime drug smugglers outside the territorial waters of the United States generally had to be prosecuted for conspiracy to import drugs into the United States. That regime proved to be unsatisfactory, primarily because of the difficulty of proving an intent to import. The problem was not that the Coast Guard lacked the authority to interdict drug smugglers and seize contraband; to the contrary, the Coast Guard has long enjoyed \"`one of the most sweeping grants of police authority ever to be written into U.S. law.'\" Note, <i>High on the Seas: Drug Smuggling, the Fourth Amendment, and Warrantless Searches at Sea,</i> 93 Harv. L.Rev. 725, 726 (1980) (quoting Stephen H. Evans, <i>The United States Coast Guard 1790-1915</i> 218 (1949)); <i>see</i> 14 U.S.C. § 89(a) (setting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> forth Coast Guard's enforcement authority). Rather, the problem derived from the limited substantive scope of the maritime drug laws: \"in most cases the Coast Guard [was] able to seize and confiscate the ship and the illegal drugs, but the government [was] not able to prosecute the crew or others involved in the smuggling operation.\" S.Rep. No. 96-855, at 2 (1980).</p>\n<p>Congress responded to the problem by enacting the Marijuana on the High Seas Act, Pub.L. No. 96-350, 94 Stat. 1159 (1980), which broadened the drug laws in a number of ways. Most importantly, the statute made it a crime for certain individuals on the high seas to possess drugs with the intent to distribute, which obviated the need to prove that the drugs were destined for the United States and opened the door for a much broader extraterritorial application of the federal drug laws. <i>See</i> 125 Cong. Rec. 20,083 (1979) (statement of Rep. Paul McCloskey) (\"Where current law requires an intent to import a controlled substance into the United States as a necessary element of the crime[,] this bill essentially requires only knowledge or intent to distribute with no need to establish a U.S. destination. Such intent may be inferred from the presence of controlled substances that exceed normal consumptionand that are not entered as cargo on a vessel's manifest.\").</p>\n<p>The majority is correct that the Marijuana on the High Seas Act and its successor statutes manifest an intent to reach broadly. Congress was concerned about maritime drug trafficking and sought to \"give the Justice Department the maximum prosecutorial authority permitted under international law.\" S. Rep. 96-855, at 2; <i>see also</i> 125 Cong. Rec. 20,083 (1979) (statement of Rep. Paul McCloskey) (stating that the bill authorizes prosecution \"to the broadest extent possible under international law\"). As the quoted legislative history makes clear, however, Congress also intended to stay within the boundaries of international law, which places limitations on a nation's power \"to make its law applicable to the activities, relations, or status of persons.\" <i>Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States</i> § 401(a) (1987). Those limitations, referred to under the heading \"jurisdiction to prescribe,\" have traditionally permitted nations to legislate with respect to (1) their own nationals; (2) acts committed within, or having substantial effects within, their territory; and (3) acts directed at their national security.<sup>[9]</sup><i>Id.</i> § 402.</p>\n<p>On the high seas, there is an additional basis of jurisdiction to prescribe: vessel nationality.<sup>[10]</sup> Vessels, like people, are capable of having nationality, and a vessel on the high seas (and those aboard it) may be subjected to the laws of the country whose nationality she bears. <i>See id.</i> § 502(2). A Canadian vessel, for example, may properly be subjected to the laws of Canada. The high seas legal regime depends upon <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> vessels having one, and only one, nationality. Vessels without any nationality at all (also referred to as stateless vessels) are subject to the prescriptive jurisdiction of every nation. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Victoria,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524619\"><a href=\"/opinion/524619/united-states-v-luis-alberto-victoria/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span>, 1010-11 (1st Cir.1989); <i>United States v. Marino-Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405012\"><a href=\"/opinion/405012/united-states-v-esteban-marino-garcia-and-omar-chaverra-hernan/\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1373</span></a></span>, 1380-83 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p>Although the settled bases of prescriptive jurisdiction are broad, they are not limitless. A country must be able to point to one of those bases when extending its penal laws to an individual. If Congress had made it a federal crime for any person to possess drugs on board any vessel anywhere, it would have run afoul of the international legal limitations on its jurisdiction to prescribe.<sup>[11]</sup> Congress therefore limited the reach of the Marijuana on the High Seas Act to five categories of persons: (1) United States citizens, (2) individuals on board a vessel within the customs waters of the United States, (3) individuals intending to import drugs into United States territory or who know drugs will be imported into the United States, (4) individuals on board a vessel with United States nationality, and (5) individuals on board a U.S. vessel or a \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States on the high seas,\" which was defined to include a \"vessel without nationality or a vessel assimilated to a vessel without nationality.\" Pub.L. No. 96-350, 94 Stat. 1159. Each of those categories corresponds to one of the traditional bases for exercising prescriptive jurisdictionnationality of the defendant, territoriality, national security, nationality of the vessel, and statelessness. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 96-323, at 10-11 (1979). The point made explicit in the legislative history is thus apparent from the text of the statute as well: Congress intended to extend the maritime drug laws to what it viewed as the limits provided by international law, but no further.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act</h2>\n<p>By 1986, Congress had become convinced that the Marijuana on the High Seas Act was in need of revision. In Congress's view, \"defendants in cases involving foreign or stateless vessel boardings and seizures [had] been relying heavily on international jurisdictional questions as legal technicalities to escape conviction.\" S.Rep. No. 99-530, at 15, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5986, 6000 (1986). Congress enacted the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, Pub.L. 99-640, § 17, 100 Stat. 3545 (1986), with a view toward further expanding and strengthening the maritime drug laws. Its approach was measured, however. Although Congress extended the statute's coverage to several new categories of defendantsmost notably, to individuals on board \"a vessel registered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of United States law by the United States\"<sup>[13]</sup>it otherwise retained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> the pre-existing restrictions on the statute's substantive scope. <i>Id.</i> Congress also added a provision partially defining the phrase \"vessel without nationality,\" which had been left undefined in the original statute.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. 1996 Amendments</h2>\n<p>Congress amended the MDLEA again in 1996. <i>See</i> Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-324, § 1138, 110 Stat. 3901, 3988-89 (1996). The intent, as before, was to \"expand the Government's prosecutorial effectiveness in drug smuggling cases.\" H.R.Rep. No. 104-854, at 142, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4239, 4292 (1996) (Conf.Rep.). To that end, Congress further expanded the definition of \"vessel without nationality,\" Pub.L. No. 104-324, § 1138(a)(1),<sup>[15]</sup> added provisions making it easier for the government to prove that a foreign nation consented to the prosecution, <i>id.</i> § 1138(a)(2)-(3), and declared that MDLEA defendants \"shall not have standing to raise the claim of failure to comply with international law as a basis for a defense,\" <i>id.</i> § 1138(a)(4). Congress also enacted an unusual provision that has assumed importance in this case:</p>\n<blockquote>Jurisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense. All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 1138(a)(5). Otherwise, the amendments left the substantive limitations on the MDLEA's scope unaltered.</p>\n<p>With this background in mind, I turn to the majority's analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The majority holds, as a threshold matter, that the government's proof that the defendants' vessel is covered by the MDLEA must be by a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. I do not agree. Like the majority, I do not believe the burden of proof affects the outcome of this case. Nevertheless, I wish to respond to the majority's analysis.</p>\n<p>Prior to the 1996 amendments to the MDLEA, vessel status had to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Guerrero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197385\"><a href=\"/opinion/197385/united-states-v-amado-guerrero/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 339 (1st Cir.1997).<sup>[16]</sup> The 1996 amendments expressly removed the vessel status issue from the jury's consideration. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a). They did not address the standard of proof, however. I would presume, in the absence of any tex-tual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> indication to the contrary, that Congress did not intend to silently alter the longstanding rule that vessel status must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"146984\"><a href=\"/opinion/146984/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span> (2010) (\"Congress does not enact substantive changes <i>sub silentio.</i>\").</p>\n<p>The majority offers several justifications for reading an implied shift in the standard of proof into the 1996 amendments. First, it says that Congress intended vessel status to be \"a preliminary issue, like venue and other judge-determined issues\" that are commonly proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a) (characterizing \"[j]urisdiction,\" i.e., vessel status, as a \"preliminary question[] of law\"). But that rationale is in conflict with our decision in <i>United States v. González,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200216\"><a href=\"/opinion/200216/united-states-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2002), where we held that vessel status goes to \"the substantive reach of the statute applying to some vessels but not others\" rather than to the threshold issue of the court's authority to hear the case. <i>Id.</i> at 443 (emphasis omitted). Unlike venue and the other procedural and evidentiary matters mentioned by the majority, a failure to prove that defendants' conduct occurred on board a covered vessel amounts to a failure to prove that the defendants violated the MDLEA. <i>Compare id.</i> (\"Congress asserted its own authority to regulate drug trafficking on some ships but not all ships and, in this context, used the word `jurisdiction' loosely to describe its own assertion of authority to regulate; it does the same thing whenever it fixes an `affects interstate commerce' or `involved a federally insured bank' as a condition of the crime.\"), <i>with </i><i>Am. Dredging Co. v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112930\"><a href=\"/opinion/112930/american-dredging-co-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 453, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112930\"><a href=\"/opinion/112930/american-dredging-co-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span> (1994) (\"[V]enue is a matter that goes to process rather than substantive rightsdetermining which among various competent courts will decide the case.\").<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>It is equally unhelpful to suggest, as the majority does, that Congress's allocation of decision-making authority to the judge necessarily implies a shift in the standard of proof because \"jury fact-finding and the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard generally go hand in hand.\" Although the two issues often go hand in hand, they are not invariably linked. Venue, for instance, is established by a preponderance of the evidence but must be submitted to the jury when put in issue. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jackalow,</i> 66 U.S. (1 Black) 484, 487-88, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Conversely, petty offenses are tried to the court but subject to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

For example, there is no federal constitutional right to a jury trial in juvenile delinquency proceedings, <i>see </i><i>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108378\"><a href=\"/opinion/108378/mckeiver-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 547, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108378\"><a href=\"/opinion/108378/mckeiver-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span> (1971), yet the charges in such proceedings <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> must nevertheless be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, <i>see </i><i>In re Winship,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 364, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span> (1970). As these authorities indicate, Congress's decision to \"remove from the jury and confide to the judge\" the question of vessel status, <i>González,</i> 311 F.3d at 443, does not necessarily imply that Congress intended to lower the government's burden of proof as well. The two issues, though \"interrelated,\" <i>Sullivan v. Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 278, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Congress always and understandably wants criminals to be brought to justice. That fact is not a license to interpret every criminal statute as broadly as possible. Congress is also mindful of individual rights, international law, and the need for substantive and procedural limitations on the federal criminal power. The question in this case, as in every case, is where Congress struck the balance between those considerations and the desire to punish wrongdoers. The majority's unelaborated reference to Congress's \"aim to facilitate enforcement\" does not meaningfully advance that inquiry. To the contrary, it tends to obscure the nuanced approach that Congress took in the statute. <i>Cf. </i><i>Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. Dimension Fin.

It was the government's burden to prove that the defendants' yola was a \"vessel without nationality.\" That statutory phrase dates to the original Marijuana on the High Seas Act, which left the term undefined. It was evidently meant to refer to vessels that would be considered stateless under international law. Congress subsequently added three specific examples of \"vessel[s] without nationality\" to the statute. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1) (quoted <i>infra.</i>) As the majority correctly holds, Congress did not intend those three examples to be exhaustive. The MDLEA extends to vessels that are considered stateless under international law, even if those vessels do not fall within one of the specifically enumerated categories.<sup>[19]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v.

Meyers, <i>The Nationality of Ships</i> 147 (1967). In other countries, nationality must be bestowed through an affirmative act of the government. <i>Id.</i> Still other countries link nationality to registration, granting their nationality automatically to ships that are registered in accordance with the law. <i>Id.</i> Many countries, including the United States, combine elements of the different systems. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(b); Ted L. McDorman, <i>Stateless Fishing Vessels, International Law and the U.N. High Seas Fisheries Conference,</i> 25 J. Mar. L. &amp; Comm. 531, 533 (1994) (\"Practice in the United States suggests that where a vessel is not registered, the nationality of the vessel can become that of the vessel's owner.\"); <i>The Chiquita,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1502223\"><a href=\"/opinion/1502223/the-chiquita/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 418 (5th Cir.1927) (\"If [a vessel] is not properly registered, her nationality is still that of her owner.\").</p>\n<p>A vessel either has a given nationality or it does not. It is therefore incorrect to suggest, as the majority does, that whether a vessel is stateless depends upon the circumstances in which it is encountered. <i>See</i> Majority Opinion at 6 (\"The controlling question is whether <i>at the point at which the authorities confront the vessel,</i> it bears the insignia or papers of a national vessel or its master is prepared to make an affirmative and sustainable claim of nationality.\" (emphasis added)). Under international law, a stateless vessel is simply one that does not have a valid grant of nationality from any country. <i>See </i><i>Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d at 171. That may be the case if, for example, no country has ever granted the vessel nationality; if a country has canceled its grant of nationality; or if the political entity that granted the vessel nationality is not a recognized international person. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Because statelessness is the absence of nationality, the task of establishing that a vessel is genuinely stateless can \"present the difficulties often associated with proving a negative.\" <i>Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d at 171. International law deals with this problem by permitting nations to <i>deem</i> a vessel that \"repeatedly, deliberately, and successfully\" obscures its nationality to be stateless, irrespective of whether the vessel is genuinely stateless. Meyers, <i>supra,</i> at 322. In a similar vein, a vessel that claims the nationality of two or more countries according to convenience is \"assimilated to\" (in the sense of \"rendered similar to\" or \"deemed to be\") a vessel without nationality, even if it legitimately possesses a nationality. Convention on the High Seas art. 6(2). These rules operate as sanctions, effectively penalizing vessels that attempt <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> to evade law enforcement authority on the high seas.</p>\n<p>Congress took this notion of \"deemed\" statelessness a step further in the MDLEA. Under the statute, three additional categories of vessels that make false or evasive claims of nationality are deemed to be stateless:</p>\n<blockquote>(A) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge makes a claim of registry that is denied by the nation whose registry is claimed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge fails, on request of an officer of the United States authorized to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(C) a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge makes a claim of registry and for which the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.</blockquote>\n<p>46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1).</p>\n<p>To summarize, international law and the MDLEA recognize two basic categories of vessels without nationality. In the first category are vessels that are genuinely stateless under international law, in the sense that they do not have a valid grant of nationality from any country. In the second category are vessels that are <i>deemed</i> to be stateless because they have attempted to obscure their nationality. I will discuss each of these categories in explaining why I do not believe the government carried its burden of proving that the defendants' yola fell within the scope of the MDLEA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Genuine Statelessness</h2>\n<p>The government argues that the yola was genuinely stateless because the defendants \"were not flying a flag, carried no documentation, and never claimed to the Coast Guard that their ship was registered in the Dominican Republic or flew a Dominican flag.\" Insofar as the government means to suggest that any vessel that fails to affirmatively signal its nationality through a flag, documents, or an oral claim of registry becomes stateless under international law, it is mistaken. Registration, documentation, and the flag are \"indicators\" of vessel nationality, but they are not sources of vessel nationality. <i>See</i> Meyers, <i>supra,</i> at 138-140; <i>see also </i><i>Lauritzen,</i> 345 U.S. at 584, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105130\"><a href=\"/opinion/105130/lauritzen-v-larsen/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></span> (1865) (\"The purpose of a register is to declare the nationality of a vessel engaged in trade with foreign nations, and to enable her to assert that nationality wherever found.\"); Henry Wheaton, <i>Elements of International Law</i> 425 n. 163 (Richard Henry Dana, Jr., ed., 8th ed. 1866) (distinguishing between a vessel's \"ostensible nationality,\" which is indicated by its flag and documents, and its \"actual nationality, which depends on the domicile of the owner and other facts\").</p>\n<p>Under international law, \"[a] vessel may be considered as possessing the nationality of a State even though she is unregistered, possesses no documents evidencing that nationality, nor even flies the flag of that State.\"<sup>[21]</sup> N.P. Ready, <i>Ship Registration</i> 3 (3d ed.1998); <i>see also</i> McDorman, <i>supra,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> at 533 (\"Determining vessel nationality ... is not just a question of documentation of the vessel[,] and a vessel <i>literally</i> without a flag, not being a vessel registered in a country, is not necessarily stateless or without nationality.\"); <i>Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d at 172-73 (holding that it was error to instruct the jury that it could find a vessel genuinely stateless \"based on an unstructured weighing of the totality of the evidence,\" including various indicators of nationality). Even pirate ships possessing no documents and flying the flag of an unrecognized insurrectionary movement do not necessarily lose their nationality. <i>See</i> Convention on the High Seas art. 18 (\"A ship or aircraft may retain its nationality although it has become a pirate ship or aircraft. The retention or loss of nationality is determined by the law of the State from which such nationality was derived.\"); United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea art. 104, Dec. 10, 1982, S. Treaty Doc. No. 103-39, 1833 U.N.T.S. 3 (same). The question in every case turns on national law.</p>\n<p>There is a separate question of whether the absence of a flag and documentation, though not directly affecting a vessel's nationality, can provide circumstantial evidence of statelessness. I believe it can. Common sense suggests that a vessel that lacks the usual indicators of nationality is more likely to be stateless than an equivalently situated vessel possessing such indicators. <i>Cf.</i> Fed.R.Evid. 401. But even acknowledging that to be so, it does not mean that proof that a vessel lacks the usual indicators of nationality is alone sufficient to justify the inferential conclusion that the vessel is, in fact, stateless. The reasonableness of such a conclusion will depend on other factors that are particular to each case.</p>\n<p>It is not necessary to enumerate those factors comprehensively to see that such an inference is not warranted here. The yola in question was a small wooden boat equipped with an outboard motor. It undisputedly originated in the Dominican Republic and was carrying Dominican crew members. It was sighted just outside Dominican territorial waters (within the Dominican Republic's Exclusive Economic Zone) and was obviously incapable of making long international voyages. Although the vessel was not carrying documentation, \"[m]any states ... do not issue documents to ships with a tonnage below a given figure.\" Meyers, <i>supra,</i> at 160; <i>see also</i> R.R. Churchill &amp; A.V. Lowe, <i>The Law of the Sea</i> 213 n. 19 (3d ed.1999) (noting that \"a State may not require, or permit, the registration of ships below a certain size, for example, but may nonetheless regard such ships as having its nationality if they are owned by its nationals\"). Defendant Soto-Pérez testified at trial that the yola was owned by a Dominican man and was registered in some fashion with the Dominican government.</p>\n<p>All of this evidence points strongly toward Dominican nationality. The government, which bore the burden of proving that the yola was stateless, offered nothing to rebut or undermine that conclusion. It submitted no evidence regarding Dominican law on nationality, presented no statement from a Dominican official, and generally made no attempt to eliminate the Dominican Republic as the most plausible candidate for nationality. Nor did the government obtain the Dominican Republic's consent to prosecution, <i>see</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(1)(C), which could have provided a fallback position in the event that the evidence of statelessness proved deficient.<sup>[22]</sup> The district court, for its part, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> appears to have shifted the burden of proof to the defendants. At one point, the judge told defense counsel: \"You could have brought the owner of the boat to testify. You could have done that. He would have told you yes, this was my boat. I bought it. I have pictures of the boat. Here they are. I have it registered. Brought certified papers of the registry. All those things could have been done.\" Needless to say, it was not the defendants' burden to prove that their boat fell outside the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p>Given all the circumstances, I believe it was erroneous for the district court to conclude, based solely on the lack of a flag and documentation, that the defendants' vessel was genuinely stateless. Those factors would almost certainly have justified the detention and boarding of the yola, which may be based on a \"reasonable suspicion\" that a vessel is stateless.<sup>[23]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375926\"><a href=\"/opinion/375926/united-states-v-frank-gunnar-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1063</span></a></span>, 1082 (5th Cir.1980) (en banc); Proposed Interdiction of Haitian Flag Vessels, 5 Op. O.L.C. 242, 243 n. 4 (1981) (\"Ships flying no flag may also be stopped to determine if they are stateless.\"). But the question of whether there are reasonable grounds for detaining and searching a vessel is \"separate\" from the question of whether the vessel is truly stateless and, as such, falls within the ambit of the MDLEA. <i>United States v. Potes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526967\"><a href=\"/opinion/526967/united-states-v-parmenio-potes-united-states-of-america-v-wilfrido/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1475</span></a></span>, 1478 (1st Cir.1989). On the facts of this case, I do not believe the government satisfied its burden of proving the latter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Deemed Statelessness</h2>\n<p>The question, then, is whether the yola can be <i>deemed</i> to be stateless. The majority concludes that it can. My colleagues rely primarily on the provision extending the MDLEA to \"a vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge fails, on request of an officer of the United States authorized to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel.\" 46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(1)(B).<sup>[24]</sup> Pursuant to the text of that provision, the failure to claim nationality has legal consequences only in specific circumstances: when a specified individual <i>aboard</i> the vessel fails to respond to a federal law enforcement officer's request for a claim of nationality.</p>\n<p>Here, however, no federal officer requested the yola's nationality while the defendants were still on board the vessel. Officer Young questioned the defendants after they were picked up by the Dominican Coast Guard. Among other things, he asked \"if anybody would like to speak for the boat and give [him] a claim of nationality.\" The defendants \"shook their heads no, and actually did not give [him] a full <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> response.\"<sup>[25]</sup> I will assume that this exchange would ordinarily constitute a request for, and a failure to make, a claim of nationality under the MDLEA. The issue remaining is whether the statute's requirement that the questioning take place \"aboard\" the suspect vessel includes within its scope questioning that took place \"aboard\" the Dominican cutter.</p>\n<p>The majority concludes that \"aboard\" as used in section 70502(d)(1)(B) is sufficiently elastic to embrace the questioning that took place here, despite my colleagues' recognition that the circumstances fall outside the MDLEA if \"aboard\" is given its common meaning of \"on board.\"<sup>[26]</sup> In essence, the majority concludes that \"near\" the yola is close enough to \"aboard\" the yola in light of the other indicators of statelessness, including the absence of a flag or registry papers and the crew's failure to make an affirmative claim of nationality.</p>\n<p>But a court does not have license to expand the scope of a criminal statute merely because it believes that doing so is consistent with Congress's law enforcement objectives. In enacting the MDLEA, Congress was acting against the backdrop of international law. As noted earlier, the international standard for deeming statelessness requires proof that a vessel \"repeatedly, deliberately, and successfully\" obscured its nationality. Meyers, <i>supra,</i> at 322. The MDLEA criteria for deeming statelessness, allowing such a determination based on a single failure to respond, are significantly less demanding and may in fact overstep international norms. <i>See</i> Eugene Kontorovich, <i>Beyond the Article I Horizon: Congress's Enumerated Powers and Universal Jurisdiction over Drug Crimes,</i> 93 Minn. L.Rev. 1191, 1228 (2009) (\"[T]he MDLEA's definition of statelessness goes far beyond what is recognized by international custom or convention.\"). Although Congress has the prerogative to go beyond the limits of international law, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Bradley, <i>supra,</i> at 331 (\"Congress is free to override the limitations of international law, including the international law of prescriptive jurisdiction, when enacting a criminal statute.\"), we exceed our authority if we go beyond <i>Congress</i> in this sensitive realm.</p>\n<p>There is every reason to conclude that Congress did not include the word \"aboard\" in section 70502(d)(1)(B) casually. To the contrary, the boarding of vessels by law enforcement officials is a significant step, and allowing authorities to board for limited investigatory purposes is a traditional \"exception to the principle of noninterference on the high seas.\" <i>United States v. Postal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362346\"><a href=\"/opinion/362346/united-states-v-robert-morris-postal-salem-l-forsythe-and-george-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></a></span>, 870 (5th Cir.1979); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

The doctrine of international common law known as the \"right of visit,\" or the \"right of approach,\" permits scrutiny of the conduct or nationality of suspicious vessels through inquiry that culminates in an \"examination on board the ship.\" Convention <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> on the High Seas art. 22;<sup>[27]</sup><i>see also, e.g., </i><i>United States v.

As I have noted, the authority conferred by that provision's language is, arguably, already beyond the bounds of international law. I can see no justification for broadening the statute's scope even further by ignoring its literal terms. If the majority were correct that failure to respond to questioning on an adjacent vessel is equivalent to questioning \"aboard\" the target vessel, what principle would distinguish inquiry at a Coast Guard station located just ashore? In such circumstances, the limited \"right to visit\" becomes a license to conduct questioning of a ship's crew wherever convenient for the authorities. In my view, neither scenario falls within a provision that deems a vessel stateless based on a specific interaction that occurs \"aboard\" that vessel.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>Abiding by the plain language of the statute need not frustrate Congress's objective to prosecute maritime drug trafficking nor undermine law enforcement efforts. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> In this case, for example, the Coast Guard could likely have brought the defendants within the scope of the MDLEA by obtaining the consent of the Dominican Republic, the yola's apparent country of nationality. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(1)(C). Alternatively, the government could have alleged that the yola was either a Dominican vessel or a stateless vessel and further investigated its nationality after the defendants' arrest. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v.

In the end, however, I fear that the majority's focus on Congress's \"aim to facilitate enforcement\" has overshadowed the considerations of fairness and international law that counsel restraint in interpreting the MDLEA. The majority's interpretation extends United States drug laws to circumstances that Congress did not contemplate and that likely exceed the bounds of international law as well. In addition, the majority has lowered the traditional standard of proof for finding guilt.

However, Congress, in enacting the Marijuana on the High Seas Act, apparently viewed vessel nationality as a supplement to the traditional bases of prescriptive jurisdiction. The <i>Restatement</i> concurs in that view. <i>See Restatement (Third)</i> § 402 reporters' note 4 (characterizing vessel nationality as \"an addition to the general bases of jurisdiction set forth in this section\").</p>\n<p>[11]  Although Congress could enact criminal laws that go beyond the limitations of international law, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Curtis A. Bradley, <i>Universal Jurisdiction and U.S. Law,</i> 2001 U. Chi. Legal F. 323, 331 (2001), its intention at the time, as indicated above, apparently was to stay within those limits. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v.

No. 99-640, 100 Stat. 3545.</p>\n<p>[15]  The new provision added to the definition \"a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.\"</p>\n<p>[16]  Our court was not alone in that interpretation. \"Prior to 1996, there was a consensus among the circuits that `the jurisdictional requirement... is an element of the crime charged and therefore must be decided by the jury.'\" <i>United States v.

That provision simply means that international law does not supply an independent basis for defending against an MDLEA prosecution. To the extent that international law informs the scope of the statute itself, it must necessarily be considered in determining whether a defendant's conduct falls within the statute. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Alvarez-Machain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112751\"><a href=\"/opinion/112751/united-states-v-alvarez-machain/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 666, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112751\"><a href=\"/opinion/112751/united-states-v-alvarez-machain/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span> (1992) (distinguishing between the invocation of international law as \"an independent basis for the right respondent asserts not to be tried in the United States\" and the invocation of international law to \"inform the interpretation of the Treaty terms\").</p>\n<p>[20]  A vessel that has been granted the nationality of a particular country is often said to sail \"under the flag\" of that country (the \"flag state\") or to be entitled to \"fly the flag\" of that country. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Convention on the High Seas art. 5, Apr. 29, 1958, 13 U.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82. To prevent confusion with the national flag that is often flown from the stern of a ship, I avoid those metaphors in favor of the term \"nationality.\"</p>\n<p>[21]  One commentator colorfully illustrates this principle: \"According to international law the flying of the national flag was never the cause ofor the condition for[nationality]. When the last bunting on board was blown to tatters, this never had radical legal consequences, nor had the hoisting of the flag.\" Meyers, <i>supra,</i> at 162.</p>\n<p>[22]  The majority's suggestion that the transfer of the crew by the Dominican Coast Guard may have constituted informal consent is interesting, but it is not an appropriate basis for affirming the judgment in this case. Consent was not charged in the indictment, argued below, or raised on appeal.</p>\n<p>[23]  As it happens, the Dominican Republic has given the United States blanket authorization to board and search any Dominican vessel on the high seas \"suspected of illicit traffic\" in drugs. Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Dominican Republic Concerning Maritime Counter-Drug Operations, U.S.-Dom. Rep., art. 10, Mar. 23, 1995, T.I.A.S. No. 12620. However, the Dominican Republic has retained the \"primary right\" to prosecute the individuals on board such a vessel. <i>Id.</i> art. 11.</p>\n<p>[24]  The majority also suggests that the defendants' failure to make an \"affirmative claim of nationality\" is on its own enough to bring them within the scope of the MDLEA. That suggestion finds no support in the statute, which addresses the failure to claim nationality in a separate section that is inapplicable here. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>[25]  Officer Young further testified: \"I asked who was the captain of the vessel they were on or the senior person, and they responded that there was no single person in charge.... Because I could not get one individual to make a claim for the vessel, I then questioned what was the nationality of the personnel. And they had all told me and informed me that they were from the Dominican Republic. I asked if the boat had come from the Dominican Republic as well, and they, in turn, agreed.\"</p>\n<p>[26]  The majority observes in a footnote that the dictionary definitions of \"aboard\" include \"alongside of.\" As described <i>infra,</i> however, the international law context leaves no doubt that Congress had the ordinary usage of the word in mind. <i>See infra.</i></p>\n<p>[27]  Article 22 of the Convention codifies the common law doctrine and states, in part:\n</p>\n<p>1. Except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty, a warship which encounters a foreign merchant ship on the high seas is not justified in boarding her unless there is reasonable ground for suspecting:</p>\n<p>(a) That the ship is engaged in piracy; or</p>\n<p>(b) That the ship is engaged in the slave trade; or</p>\n<p>(c) That, though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship.</p>\n<p>2. In the cases provided for in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, the warship may proceed to verify the ship's right to fly its flag. To this end, it may send a boat under the command of an officer to the suspected ship. If suspicion remains after the documents have been checked, it may proceed to a further examination on board the ship, which must be carried out with all possible consideration.</p>\n<p>A Coast Guard cutter is considered a \"warship\" for purposes of this provision. <i>Postal,</i> 589 F.2d at 871 n. 13 (citing Convention on the High Seas art. 8(2)); <i>United States v. Cortes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"361206\"><a href=\"/opinion/361206/united-states-v-alberto-cortes-humberto-medrano-gil-catalino-mercado/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 110 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p>[28]  Officer Young testified that the yola was boarded pursuant to a right of visit.</p>\n<p>[29]  The majority's observation that Congress used the word \"includes\" when it listed specific instances of deemed statelessness does not help its argument that section 70502(d)(1) reaches the circumstances here. To construe the word \"aboard\" as the majority proposes is effectively to nullify a limitation on the scope of the statute as enacted. The rules of statutory construction do not permit us to rewrite the statute by ignoring a word chosen by Congress. <i>See </i><i>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 339, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2326</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span> (1979) (\"In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\").</p>\n<p>[30]  Indeed, as noted <i>supra,</i> the United States has authority to search any Dominican vessel on the high seas suspected of involvement in drug trafficking. Because the Dominican Republic retains the right to prosecute individuals for such crimes, the United States presumably would transfer the custody of any arrested persons upon request from the Dominican government if the vessel were determined to be Dominican.</p>\n<p>[31]  Of course, federal officers may encounter scenarios in which an overly rigid reading of the statute would truly frustrate congressional purposes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d at 174 (\"By clear implication, ... [the failure to claim nationality] provision applies when the master of a ship flees and leaves no one in charge....\"). This case does not present such a situation.</p>\n\n</div>",
