After  a  three-day  jury\n                                \n\ntrial,  defendants-appellants  Desmond  Jadusingh  and  Karen\n\nWhitaker were convicted of conspiring to import approximately\n\ntwo kilograms  of cocaine into  the customs territory  of the\n\nUnited  States in  violation of  21  U.S.C.     952 and  963.\n\nAppellants  also were convicted of conspiring to possess with\n\nintent to  distribute  the same  cocaine in  violation of  21\n\nU.S.C.    841(a)(1) and 846.  On appeal, both raise a host of\n\nchallenges  to  their  convictions.

See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g.,  United States v.  Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d  1026, 1029 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir.  1993).   Donna Marie  Carr  is the  mother of  Kimberly\n\nMiller.   In  the  summer  of 1991,  Carr  was approached  by\n\nMiller's   boyfriend,  Desmond   Jadusingh,   and  asked   to\n\nparticipate  in  an  international  drug  smuggling  venture.\n\nJadusingh wanted  Carr to  travel  with two  couriers he  had\n\nrecruited,  Miller and  Karen Whitaker,  so  that Carr  could\n\nlearn the operation and step  in if either Miller or Whitaker\n\nbacked out.  The trip was planned for January 1992.   \n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          As the date of departure drew near, Carr approached\n\nPittsfield,  Massachusetts,  police officer  Timothy  Surrell\n\nabout the venture.   He, in  turn, alerted the  Massachusetts\n\nDrug  Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\")  and arranged for  two MDEA\n\nagents  to join  him  in  a meeting  with  Carr.   The  group\n\ngathered  at a local restaurant,  where Carr told Surrell and\n\nthe agents that she would  be meeting with Jadusingh later in\n\nthe day to finalize the arrangements.  Fearing that she would\n\nnot  remember  all  of  the  anticipated  conversation,  Carr\n\nvolunteered to  wear a  concealed wire to  the rendezvous  at\n\nJadusingh  and  Miller's  apartment.    That  evening,   Carr\n\nrecorded  a  conversation in  which  Jadusingh, Whitaker  and\n\nMiller  discussed their  plans to  travel to  Puerto Rico  to\n\npurchase and import two kilograms of cocaine.  Meanwhile, DEA\n\nagents and local police, in a nearby parking lot, listened to\n\nthe live transmission of the conversation. \n\n          Two days  later, on  January 16,  1992, Carr  drove\n\nJadusingh, Whitaker and Miller from Pittsfield to Jadusingh's\n\nhouse  on Long  Island, New  York,  where Jadusingh  gathered\n\nmoney  and clothing  for the  trip.   The following  morning,\n\nJadusingh's brother  drove all four to  Kennedy International\n\nAirport, where  they boarded a  plane for Puerto Rico.   Upon\n\narrival, the  group, under  surveillance by  officers of  the\n\nfederal Drug Enforcement Administration  (\"DEA\"), traveled to\n\nthe Holiday  Inn Crown Plaza  in Carolina, Puerto Rico.   All\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nthree of  the women stayed  in room 519 while  Jadusingh, who\n\nwanted to  keep his distance  from the women, stayed  in room\n\n309, which was  registered to a Karen Bailey.1   Whitaker and\n\nCarr were instructed by Jadusingh  not to mention his name in\n\npublic and to contact him only  by phone.  They were provided\n\na telephone  credit card  number to  charge calls as  needed.\n\nFor  the most part,  Jadusingh rationed out  instructions and\n\nmoney through Miller on an as-needed basis.  He also demanded\n\nreceipts for all expenses.\n\n          Shortly  after arriving in  Puerto Rico,  the group\n\nwas informed  by its drug  contact, Etlyn, that there  was an\n\nunexpected change of plans.  Jadusingh's cocaine had not been\n\nunloaded in  Puerto Rico  as expected, and  would have  to be\n\npicked up  in Curacao.2   While Jadusingh remained  in Puerto\n\nRico, the three women,  accompanied by surveilling undercover\n\nDEA agents, traveled to Curacao to pick up the cocaine.  Once\n\nthere,  Miller  met with  a  man  known  only as  Junior  and\n\nexchanged $5800  of Jadusingh's money  for approximately  two\n\nkilograms of  cocaine.  In  an attempt to compensate  for the\n\nunplanned detour, Junior promised an additional two kilograms\n\nof cocaine  and instructed  the  women to  change hotels  and\n\nawait delivery.\n\n                    \n\n1.  Karen Whitaker is also known as Karen Bailey.\n\n2.  Curacao is the  main island of the  Netherlands Antilles,\noff the northwest coast of Venezuela.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Meanwhile,  Miller  and  Whitaker  purchased  razor\n\nblades, plastic baggies, tape and  girdles.  With the help of\n\nCarr, the two women divided and packed the cocaine  according\n\nto  Jadusingh's instructions.  Jadusingh, who was in frequent\n\nphone  contact with his couriers, directed  them to bring the\n\ncocaine back  to the United  States by way of  St. Martin and\n\nSt.  Thomas.    According  to  Jadusingh,  smuggling  cocaine\n\nthrough customs in St. Thomas was easier than through customs\n\nin  Puerto Rico.  When Jadusingh subsequently discovered that\n\nhe could not  fly to St. Thomas without  a passport, however,\n\nhe told the women to abandon Junior's additional delivery and\n\nreturn immediately to the Holiday Inn in Puerto Rico. \n\n          On  January 23, 1992, Miller and Whitaker taped the\n\nbaggies  containing the cocaine to their stomachs and further\n\nsecured the contraband with the girdles.  Together with Carr,\n\nthey boarded  a plane  bound for Aruba.   After  spending the\n\nnight in Aruba, Miller and Whitaker again secured the cocaine\n\nto  their  bodies  and  boarded  a  plane  for  Puerto  Rico.\n\nMeanwhile,  at Puerto  Rico's Luis Munoz  Marin International\n\nAirport, Senior Customs Inspector Sonia Maldonado was alerted\n\nby DEA agents  that two persons would be  arriving from Aruba\n\nwith  contraband.     Maldonado,  who  was  not   told  which\n\npassengers  would be carrying the drugs, became suspicious of\n\nWhitaker  and Miller because  they were wearing  bulky winter\n\njackets on what she described  as a particularly hot day.   A\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\npersonal search  of Whitaker  by Maldonado and  of Miller  by\n\nSenior   Customs    Inspector   Maria    Esquilin   uncovered\n\napproximately two kilograms of a concealed white powder which\n\nwas field tested  and found to be cocaine.   After completing\n\nthe  search, Maldonado delivered  Whitaker to DEA  agent Eric\n\nJohnson.   Jadusingh was  arrested at  the Holiday Inn  later\n\nthat day. \n\n          On February 5, 1992,  a grand jury returned a  two-\n\ncount  indictment  against  Jadusingh,  Miller and  Whitaker.\n\nCount  one charged the  defendants with conspiracy  to import\n\ncocaine from  Aruba to the  United States in violation  of 21\n\nU.S.C.    952 and 963.  Count two charged the defendants with\n\nconspiracy  to possess  with intent  to  distribute the  same\n\ncocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1)  and 846.  The\n\ndefendants pled not  guilty at their arraignment.   Jadusingh\n\nand Whitaker were tried without Miller, who  fled after being\n\nreleased on bail and was later arrested and tried separately.\n\nCarr   was  the  government's  lead  witness  at  the  trial.\n\nJadusingh  and  Whitaker were  convicted  on both  conspiracy\n\ncounts.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On   appeal,   Jadusingh  and   Whitaker   together\n\nprimarily argue:  (1) the  court erred in allowing Donna Carr\n\nto testify; (2) the court impermissibly admitted an audiotape\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ninto evidence;  and  (3) the  court  erred in  denying  their\n\nrespective  Rule  29  motions  for   acquittal.3    Jadusingh\n\nfurther  contends  1)  that  the  district  court  improperly\n\nenhanced his sentence,  and  2) that he  was denied effective\n\nassistance of counsel.4  We discuss each argument in turn.\n\n     A.  Donna Carr\n                   \n\n          Jadusingh  and  Whitaker  argue that  the  district\n\ncourt  erred   in  allowing  Donna  Carr,   the  government's\n\nconfidential  informant   and  lead   witness,  to   testify.\n\nSpecifically,  the defendants claim (1) that the court should\n\nhave excluded Carr's testimony because the government  failed\n\nto disclose Carr's criminal history in violation of Brady  v.\n                                                             \n\nMaryland, 373  U.S. 83 (1963);  and (2) that the  trial judge\n        \n\nprecluded  Jadusingh's   attorney  from   effectively  cross-\n\nexamining  Carr.   We  find  both of  these  arguments to  be\n\nwithout merit.\n\n          1.  Brady Violations\n                              \n\n          In  Brady,   the  Supreme  Court   held  that  \"the\n                   \n\nsuppression  by the prosecution  of evidence favorable  to an\n\naccused  upon request violates due process where the evidence\n\nis material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of\n\n                    \n\n3.  Pursuant to Fed. R.  Crim. P. 29, \"The court on motion of\na defendant  or of its  own motion  shall order the  entry of\njudgment of acquittal  . . . if the  evidence is insufficient\nto sustain a conviction . . . .\"\n\n4.  Jadusingh  makes his  ineffective  assistance of  counsel\nclaim in a supplemental brief he filed pro se.\n                                             \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nthe good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\"  Id.  at 87.\n                                                     \n\nThe purpose of the Brady rule is \"to prohibit the prosecution\n                        \n\nfrom  intentionally  withholding `evidence  favorable  to the\n\naccused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a\n\nfair trail.'\"   United  States v.  Valencia-Lucena, 925  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n506, 514 (1st Cir. 1991)(quoting United States v. Bagley, 473\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 667, 675 (1985)).  The rule is not, however, intended to\n\n\"`displace the adversary system as the primary means by which\n\ntruth is uncovered.'\"  Id. (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 675).\n                                          \n\n          Here, there was  no Brady violation.   Although the\n                                   \n\ngovernment  did not  disclose  Carr's 1978  misdemeanor  drug\n\nconviction until  just before the  start of the first  day of\n\ntrial, it is uncontested that the government did not actually\n\nlearn of  this conviction until  that same  day.5   Moreover,\n\nCarr's  other past  substance abuse  and outstanding  traffic\n\nviolations  were fully disclosed during the direct and cross-\n\nexamination of Carr at trial.   Given this full disclosure of\n\nCarr's  background by  the government,  we are  at a  loss to\n\ncomprehend defendant's argument that the government committed\n\na Brady  violation.6  See  id. at 514 (government  failure to\n                              \n\n                    \n\n5.  We  further note that  defendants, although knowing about\nthe 1978 conviction, did not raise it at trial.  \n\n6.  Jadusingh  and Whitaker  also  cursorily  argue that  the\ngovernment  knowingly allowed Carr to present false testimony\nto the jury.  See United States v. Wallach, 935 F.2d  445 (2d\n                                          \nCir.  1991)(reversing conviction  where government  knowingly\nallowed star witness  to perjure himself).   Having carefully\nreviewed  all of  the  alleged  \"inconsistencies\" adduced  in\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nturn over evidence  of confidential informant's drug  use was\n\nnot Brady violation where issue was fully revealed at trial).\n         \n\n          2.  Cross Examination\n                               \n\n          Jadusingh next argues that the trial judge unfairly\n\nlimited  the scope  of  his cross-examination  of  Carr.   In\n\nsupport  of this argument, however, Jadusingh offers only the\n\nfollowing colloquy between his lawyer and Carr:\n\n               Q.  After 1985 how many warrants for\n                   your arrest did you have?\n\n               A.  Five.\n\n               Q.  You had five arrest warrants \n                   pending, you never have stated that?\n\n    [Government]:  Objection, Your Honor.\n\n       The Court:  Sustained.\n\nAfter the  trial court sustained the  government's objection,\n\nJadusingh's  attorney  neither attempted  to  reformulate his\n\nquery, nor asked  the trial judge for a  clarification of his\n\nruling.     Instead,  the   attorney  wholly  abandoned  this\n\nparticular line  of questioning of  Carr, and moved on  to an\n\nunrelated topic.\n\n          When challenging  an exclusionary  ruling like  the\n\none  before us,  the  aggrieved  party must  show  1) that  a\n\nsubstantial right was affected, and 2) that the \"substance of\n\nthe evidence [sought to be  introduced] was made known to the\n\ncourt by offer or was  apparent from the context within which\n\n                    \n\nsupport of this argument, however, we find it to be baseless.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nquestions were asked.\"   Fed. R. Evid.  103 (a) (2).   In the\n\nabsence of  this minimal  showing, our  review is  limited to\n\n\"plain error.\" Fed. R. Evid. 103(d).  In  order to show plain\n\nerror, the  complaining party must  demonstrate \"that justice\n\nhas miscarried  or that the  trial's basic fairness  has been\n\ncompromised.\"   United States v.  Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 995\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir.  1990), cert. denied, 111  S. Ct. 2062  (1991).  We\n                              \n\nfind no such error here.\n\n          We  begin  by  noting that  the  question  posed by\n\nJadusingh's  counsel at trial related solely to Carr's arrest\n\nwarrants  after  1985.    The only  evidence  in  the  record\n               \n\nregarding Carr's criminal history for this time period is her\n\ntestimony  on direct examination that she had pending traffic\n\nviolations.   Nothing in  the record remotely  intimates that\n\nfurther  cross-examination   on  this   subject  would   have\n\nuncovered evidence of other wrong-doing  on the part of  Carr\n\nor  would have  been  of any  value  to Jadusingh.   Nor  has\n\nJadusingh offered any  information on appeal tending  to show\n\nthat further cross-examination on this subject was warranted.\n\n          Further,  it is not  apparent from the  record that\n\nthe   district  court   intended   to  restrict   Jadusingh's\n\nsubstantive  inquiry into Carr's outstanding warrants.  It is\n\nequally  plausible  that  the  government  objected   to  the\n\nargumentative tone of the question.  Thus, we cannot say that\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nthe  fairness  of  Jadusingh's  trial  was  affected  by  the\n\ndistrict court's restriction of Jadusingh's cross-examination\n\nof Carr.7\n\n     B.  Admission of Tape Recording\n                                    \n\n          Jadusingh and Whitaker next argue that it was error\n\nfor  the court to permit the  jury to listen to the audiotape\n\nof the meeting  between Carr, Jadusingh, Whitaker  and Miller\n\nat  Jadusingh and  Miller's  apartment.   In  so doing,  they\n\ncontend that the  trial court should  have excluded the  tape\n\nbecause it was  inaudible.  Jadusingh further argues  that he\n\nwas prejudiced by the prosecutor's reference to the substance\n\nof the tape in her closing remarks.  We disagree.\n\n          1.  Audibility and Admission of the Tape\n                                                  \n\n          The decision to admit or exclude an audiotape rests\n\nwith the trial judge, who must decide \"whether `the inaudible\n\nparts are  so substantial as to  make the rest [of  the tape]\n\nmore  misleading  than  helpful.'\"   United  States  v. Font-\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n7.  Jadusingh also  charges that the district  court's ruling\nviolated his right to confront Carr in violation of the Sixth\nAmendment.   We fail  to see the  merit of this  argument.  A\ncriminal  defendant's  Sixth  Amendment   right  to  confront\nwitnesses  against  him/her is  not  absolute.   It  may,  of\ncourse, be  violated when  the defendant  is prohibited  from\nengaging  in  cross-examination  which   is  not  repetitive,\nharassing  or otherwise improper, but, rather, is designed to\nshow a \"prototypical form  of bias on the part of the witness\nand  thereby  to  expose  to  the  jury  information  on  the\nwitness's  reliability.\"  United  States v. Osorio,  929 F.2d\n                                                  \n753,  759 (1st  Cir.  1991).   Here,  the  question posed  by\nJadusingh's   counsel  was   argumentative  and,   therefore,\nproperly  excluded as improper cross-examination.  See id. at\n                                                          \n760. \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nRamirez,  944 F.2d  42, 47  (1st  Cir. 1991)  (quoting United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Carbone, 798 F.2d  21, 24 (1st Cir.  1986)), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 112 S. Ct.  954 (1992).  As we have  held on numerous\n      \n\noccasions,  a  trial  judge's  ruling  on  the  admission  of\n\nrecordings  is   afforded  \"broad  discretion,\"   even  where\n\nportions  of the taped conversation are unintelligible.  See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 47. \n                  \n\n          We have  listened to the tape and conclude that the\n\ndistrict court acted within its discretion in ruling that the\n\ntape as  a  whole  was  not  more  misleading  than  helpful.\n\nAlthough much of  what Jadusingh and Whitaker  say is drowned\n\nout by intermittent television noise, Carr's words are easily\n\nunderstandable as she  repeatedly paraphrases statements made\n\nby  each  defendant  to  his  or  her  discernable  approval.\n\nFurthermore, Carr's audible questions regarding money, travel\n\narrangements and customs  are addressed to, and  answered by,\n\nJadusingh,  thereby  corroborating  much  of  Carr's   direct\n\ntestimony  that Jadusingh  was  in  control  of  the  overall\n\nventure.  See  id.  We therefore affirm  the district court's\n                  \n\nadmission of this tape.8\n\n                    \n\n8.  Jadusingh  also argues  that the  tape  should have  been\nexcluded because  the government  neither provided  a written\ntranscript nor  established a  chain of custody.   As  to the\nfirst  of  these   arguments,  it  is  established   that  \"a\ntranscript  is  not  a  prerequisite  for  the  admission  of\nrecorded conversations.\"   United States v. Panzardi-Lespier,\n                                                            \n918  F.2d  313,  319 (1st  Cir.  1990).    As to  the  second\nargument, we  agree with  the Second  Circuit that,  once the\ngovernment  has established  both authenticity  and accuracy,\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n          2.  Prosecutorial Misconduct\n                                      \n\n          Jadusingh  argues  that he  was  prejudiced  by the\n\nprosecutor's  substantive reference to  the audiotape  in her\n\nclosing  remarks.   More  specifically, Jadusingh  objects to\n\nreferences made by the prosecutor to the jury that statements\n\nallegedly made by  Jadusingh were audible  and that the  jury\n\nwould  be  able  to  hear  Jadusingh  \"speaking  about  being\n\nwatchful  for dogs  that would  be sniffing\" at  the airport.\n\nJadusingh, however,  failed to  object to  this reference  at\n\ntrial  so,  once again,  we  review  for  plain error.    See\n                                                             \n\nHadfield, 918 F.2d at 995.  \n        \n\n          Even if  we were  to assume  that the  prosecutor's\n\nreference to the tape was  erroneous, the reference would not\n\nconstitute plain  error.    First  of all,  the  trial  court\n\nprovided  the jury with a limiting instruction directing them\n\n                    \n\nsufficient  foundation has been laid for the tape's admission\nwithout  proof of  chain-of-custody.  See  United  States  v.\n                                                         \nSteinberg,  551 F.2d 510,  515 (2d Cir. 1977).   We note that\n         \nthe government, through Carr, properly authenticated the tape\nand identified the voices.  See Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 47.\n                                            \n\n     Whitaker argues  that the  court erred  in allowing  the\njury  to listen  to the  tape because  it was  never formally\nmoved into evidence.  Because  Whitaker failed to raise  this\nobjection  below, we  review this  argument  under a  plainly\nerroneous standard.  See  United States v. Brennan, 994  F.2d\n                                                  \n918,  925  (1st  Cir.   1993).    We  fail  to  see  how  the\ngovernment's  failure to move the tape formally into evidence\naffected  the fundamental fairness of the  trial where 1) the\ngovernment  provided the proper foundation to admit the tape,\n2) the trial  court ruled that the government  could play the\ntape for the jury, and 3) the tape was docketed as Government\nExhibit 17.  We therefore reject this argument.  \n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nto  disregard inaudible portions of the tape.  Moreover, Carr\n\ntestified,  independently of the tape, that Jadusingh had, in\n\nfact,  warned  Carr,  Whitaker and  Miller  of  customs dogs.\n\nThus, the  very evidence which  Jadusingh now objects  to had\n\nbeen   presented  to  the  jury  by  an  independent  source.\n\nFinally,  an independent review persuades us that evidence of\n\nthe dog warnings forms a very small and inconsequential piece\n\nof  the   overall   evidence   which   supports   Jadusingh's\n\nconviction.    Accordingly, we  find  no plain  error  in the\n\ngovernment's reference to Jadusingh's inaudible statements on\n\nthe tape.\n\n     C.  Sufficiency of the Evidence of Conspiracy\n                                                  \n\n            Both Jadusingh  and Whitaker argue that there was\n\ninsufficient  evidence  to  support  their  convictions   for\n\nconspiring  to import  cocaine into  the  United States  from\n\nAruba  in  violation  of  21  U.S.C.     952  and  963,9  and\n\nconspiring  to possess  with intent  to  distribute the  same\n\n                    \n\n9.  21 U.S.C.   952 provides  in relevant part that it \"shall\nbe  unlawful  to import  into  the customs  territory  of the\nUnited  States from  any  place  outside thereof  .  . .  [a]\ncontrolled  substance . .  . .\"   Under 21 U.S.C.    963, any\nperson who  conspires to  commit the  crime above, \"shall  be\nsubject to  the same  penalties as  those prescribed  for the\noffense.\"\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\ncocaine in  violation of  21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1) and  846.10\n\nThis argument need not detain us long. \n\n          When  reviewing  a  sufficiency   of  the  evidence\n\nchallenge,   we  examine  the  evidence  in  the  light  most\n\nfavorable  to the government and affirm convictions where any\n\nrational juror  could have  found guilt  beyond a  reasonable\n\ndoubt.  See United States  v. Vavlitis, No. 93-1229, slip op.\n                                      \n\nat  15 (1st  Cir.  Nov. 19,  1993).   Conspiracy  convictions\n\nrequire proof that  the defendants entered into  an agreement\n\nwith one  another to  commit a crime.   See United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nConcemi, 957 F.2d 942, 950 (1st Cir. 1992).  We note that the\n       \n\ngovernment   may  satisfy   this  burden  by   direct  and/or\n\ncircumstantial evidence.  Valencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d at 512.\n                                         \n\n          Given that  the admission  of Carr's  testimony and\n\nthe audiotape was not  erroneous, Jadusingh's contention that\n\nthe  government  failed  to  produce evidence  sufficient  to\n\nsupport his convictions is meritless.  There is a plethora of\n\ndirect  evidence  in  the record  showing  that  Jadusingh 1)\n\nplanned  the trip  to import  the  cocaine, 2)  recruited and\n\ncontrolled Carr,  Whitaker and  Miller, and  3) provided  the\n\ntravel  money  and   the  funds  to  purchase   the  cocaine.\n\n                    \n\n10.  21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1) provides in relevant part that \"it\nshall  be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\"\nto \"possess  with  intent  to  .  . .  distribute  .  .  .  a\ncontrolled substance.\"  Under 21 U.S.C.   846, any person who\nconspires  to commit the  offense described above,  \"shall be\nsubject to  the same  penalties as  those prescribed  for the\noffense.\"\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nMoreover, DEA  agents observed Jadusingh traveling  to Puerto\n\nRico.     They  listened  in   on  at  least   one  telephone\n\nconversation between Jadusingh and Carr while  Carr, Whitaker\n\nand Miller were in Curacao.  And they also observed Jadusingh\n\nattempting  to   purchase   an   airplane   ticket,   thereby\n\ncorroborating Carr's  testimony that Jadusingh wanted to meet\n\nthe women in St. Thomas.  Moreover, additional evidence shows\n\nthat Jadusingh promised to pay the women $1000 each for their\n\nefforts and that the women were instructed to deliver cocaine\n\nvalued at  over  three hundred  thousand  dollars  ($300,000)\n\nwholesale to Jadusingh.   Thus, the evidence  produced by the\n\ngovernment  supports a reasonable inference that Jadusingh 1)\n\nagreed  with  Whitaker  and  Miller  to  commit  the  charged\n\noffenses;  2)  had  constructive possession  of  cocaine;  3)\n\nintended  to distribute  the cocaine,  see  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nVargas,  945 F.2d 426,  428-29 (1st Cir.  1991) (holding that\n      \n\none kilogram of  cocaine was \"large enough to  support a fair\n\njury inference that it  was not intended merely  for personal\n\nconsumption\"),  and 4) controlled those who actually imported\n\nthe cocaine into the United States from Aruba. \n\n          Whitaker's sufficiency argument is  based mainly on\n\nher claim that the Customs  Inspector who searched her at the\n\nMarin  Airport  in  San  Juan  could  not  identify   her  at\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\ntrial.11   We  fail to  discern any  merit in  this argument.\n\nWhitaker  was identified  in  court  by Carr  as  one of  the\n\ncoconspirators  who  planned  the  trip,  handled the  money,\n\ndivided up  the cocaine,  and attempted  to smuggle  the drug\n\ninto  the  United  States  from  Aruba.    Whitaker also  was\n\nidentified  in court  by  DEA  agent  Johnson,  who  received\n\ncustody of Whitaker from Maldonado  at the airport, as one of\n\ntwo women  who were apprehended deplaning a flight from Aruba\n\nwith cocaine strapped to their stomachs.    In  light  of the\n\nabundance of  evidence  supporting the  convictions  of  both\n\nJadusingh  and Whitaker, we  decline the invitation  to upset\n\nthe jury's findings  of their respective  guilt as to  either\n\ncount.\n\n     D.  Sentencing Enhancements\n                                \n\n          Jadusingh contends that the  evidence presented was\n\ninsufficient to uphold the trial court's two-level sentencing\n\nenhancement   for    his   organizational    role   in    the\n\nconspiracy.12  Again, we disagree. \n\n                    \n\n11.  Whitaker also argues at length that Carr was untruthful.\nOn  appeal,  it is  not  within  our  purview to  assess  the\ncredibility  of  trial witnesses.   See  Valencia-Lucena, 925\n                                                        \nF.2d at 512.\n\n12.  Under  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1, a sentencing judge may increase\na base offense level by two if the crime involved two or more\npeople  and the defendant \"was an organizer, leader, manager,\nor  supervisor\" of  the  criminal activity.    Factors to  be\nconsidered   include  \"the   exercise   of  decision   making\nauthority, the nature  of participation in the  commission of\nthe offense,  the  recruitment of  accomplices,  the  claimed\nright  to a  larger share  of the  fruits of  the crime,  the\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\n          An   enhancement   under   U.S.S.G.      3B1.1   is\n\nappropriate  if  the  government  has demonstrated  that  the\n\ndefendant \"`exercised  some  degree of  control  over  others\n\ninvolved in the commission of  the crime.'\"  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nDe La  Cruz, 996 F.2d  1307, 1315  (1st Cir.)(quoting  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

The district judge  was afforded ample opportunity to\n\nascertain  the credibility of Donna Carr  as she testified to\n\nJadusingh's  control over the drug  operation.  The record is\n\nreplete with testimony  from Carr that Jadusingh  planned and\n\nfinanced the trips to Puerto  Rico and Curacao.  According to\n\nCarr, Jadusingh directed the women's actions.  He showed them\n\n1) how to divide up and package the cocaine, 2) how  to strap\n\nit to their bodies, and 3) how to avoid detection at customs.\n\nJadusingh also provided the money to pay for the trip and the\n\ndrugs.    This  evidence  clearly  supports  a  finding  that\n\n                    \n\ndegree  of  participation  in  planning   or  organizing  the\noffense, the nature  and scope of  the illegal activity,  and\nthe degree of  control and authority exercised  over others.\"\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.1, comment.

Secs. 952 and 963.  Appellants also were convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute the same cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) and 846.  On appeal, both raise a host of challenges to their convictions.  Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions, we summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.  See, e.g., United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1029 (1st Cir.1993).  Donna Marie Carr is the mother of Kimberly Miller.  In the summer of 1991, Carr was approached by Miller's boyfriend, Desmond Jadusingh, and asked to participate in an international drug smuggling venture.  Jadusingh wanted Carr to travel with two couriers he had recruited, Miller and Karen Whitaker, so that Carr could learn the operation and step in if either Miller or Whitaker backed out.  The trip was planned for January 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the date of departure drew near, Carr approached Pittsfield, Massachusetts, police officer Timothy Surrell about the venture.  He, in turn, alerted the Massachusetts Drug Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\") and arranged for two MDEA agents to join him in a meeting with Carr.  The group gathered at a local restaurant, where Carr told Surrell and the agents that she would be meeting with Jadusingh later in the day to finalize the arrangements.  Fearing that she would not remember all of the anticipated conversation, Carr volunteered to wear a concealed wire to the rendezvous at Jadusingh and Miller's apartment.  That evening, Carr recorded a conversation in which Jadusingh, Whitaker and Miller discussed their plans to travel to Puerto Rico to purchase and import two kilograms of cocaine.  Meanwhile, DEA agents and local police, in a nearby parking lot, listened to the live transmission of the conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two days later, on January 16, 1992, Carr drove Jadusingh, Whitaker and Miller from Pittsfield to Jadusingh's house on Long Island, New York, where Jadusingh gathered money and clothing for the trip.  The following morning, Jadusingh's brother drove all four to Kennedy International Airport, where they boarded a plane for Puerto Rico.  Upon arrival, the group, under surveillance by officers of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\"), traveled to the Holiday Inn Crown Plaza in Carolina, Puerto Rico.  All three of the women stayed in room 519 while Jadusingh, who wanted to keep his distance from the women, stayed in room 309, which was registered to a Karen Bailey.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Whitaker and Carr were instructed by Jadusingh not to mention his name in public and to contact him only by phone.  They were provided a telephone credit card number to charge calls as needed.  For the most part, Jadusingh rationed out instructions and money through Miller on an as-needed basis.  He also demanded receipts for all expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after arriving in Puerto Rico, the group was informed by its drug contact, Etlyn, that there was an unexpected change of plans.  Jadusingh's cocaine had not been unloaded in Puerto Rico as expected, and would have to be picked up in Curacao.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  While Jadusingh remained in Puerto Rico, the three women, accompanied by surveilling undercover DEA agents, traveled to Curacao to pick up the cocaine.  Once there, Miller met with a man known only as Junior and exchanged $5800 of Jadusingh's money for approximately two kilograms of cocaine.  In an attempt to compensate for the unplanned detour, Junior promised an additional two kilograms of cocaine and instructed the women to change hotels and await delivery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Miller and Whitaker purchased razor blades, plastic baggies, tape and girdles.  With the help of Carr, the two women divided and packed the cocaine according to Jadusingh's instructions.  Jadusingh, who was in frequent phone contact with his couriers, directed them to bring the cocaine back to the United States by way of St. Martin and St. Thomas.  According to Jadusingh, smuggling cocaine through customs in St. Thomas was easier than through customs in Puerto Rico.  When Jadusingh subsequently discovered that he could not fly to St. Thomas without a passport, however, he told the women to abandon Junior's additional delivery and return immediately to the Holiday Inn in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 23, 1992, Miller and Whitaker taped the baggies containing the cocaine to their stomachs and further secured the contraband with the girdles.  Together with Carr, they boarded a plane bound for Aruba.  After spending the night in Aruba, Miller and Whitaker again secured the cocaine to their bodies and boarded a plane for Puerto Rico.  Meanwhile, at Puerto Rico's Luis Munoz Marin International Airport, Senior Customs Inspector Sonia Maldonado was alerted by DEA agents that two persons would be arriving from Aruba with contraband.  Maldonado, who was not told which passengers would be carrying the drugs, became suspicious of Whitaker and Miller because they were wearing bulky winter jackets on what she described as a particularly hot day.  A personal search of Whitaker by Maldonado and of Miller by Senior Customs Inspector Maria Esquilin uncovered approximately two kilograms of a concealed white powder which was field tested and found to be cocaine.  After completing the search, Maldonado delivered Whitaker to DEA agent Eric Johnson.  Jadusingh was arrested at the Holiday Inn later that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 5, 1992, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Jadusingh, Miller and Whitaker.  Count one charged the defendants with conspiracy to import cocaine from Aruba to the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 952 and 963.  Count two charged the defendants with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute the same cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) and 846.  The defendants pled not guilty at their arraignment.  Jadusingh and Whitaker were tried without Miller, who fled after being released on bail and was later arrested and tried separately.  Carr was the government's lead witness at the trial.  Jadusingh and Whitaker were convicted on both conspiracy counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Jadusingh and Whitaker together primarily argue:  (1) the court erred in allowing Donna Carr to testify;  (2) the court impermissibly admitted an audiotape into evidence;  and (3) the court erred in denying their respective Rule 29 motions for acquittal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Jadusingh further contends 1) that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence, and 2) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Donna Carr</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jadusingh and Whitaker argue that the district court erred in allowing Donna Carr, the government's confidential informant and lead witness, to testify.  Specifically, the defendants claim (1) that the court should have excluded Carr's testimony because the government failed to disclose Carr's criminal history in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963);  and (2) that the trial judge precluded Jadusingh's attorney from effectively cross-examining Carr.  We find both of these arguments to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Brady Violations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Brady, the Supreme Court held that \"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\"  Id. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-1197.   The purpose of the Brady rule is \"to prohibit the prosecution from intentionally withholding 'evidence favorable to the accused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial.' \"  United States v. Valencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d 506, 514 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 675, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985)).  The rule is not, however, intended to \" 'displace the adversary system as the primary means by which truth is uncovered.' \"  Id. (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 675, 105 S.Ct. at 3380).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was no Brady violation.  Although the government did not disclose Carr's 1978 misdemeanor drug conviction until just before the start of the first day of trial, it is uncontested that the government did not actually learn of this conviction until that same day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Moreover, Carr's other past substance abuse and outstanding traffic violations were fully disclosed during the direct and cross-examination of Carr at trial.  Given this full disclosure of Carr's background by the government, we are at a loss to comprehend defendant's argument that the government committed a Brady violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See id. at 514 (government failure to turn over evidence of confidential informant's drug use was not Brady violation where issue was fully revealed at trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Cross Examination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jadusingh next argues that the trial judge unfairly limited the scope of his cross-examination of Carr.  In support of this argument, however, Jadusingh offers only the following colloquy between his lawyer and Carr:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. After 1985 how many warrants for your arrest did you have?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Five.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. You had five arrest warrants pending, you never have stated that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Government]:  Objection, Your Honor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court:  Sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the trial court sustained the government's objection, Jadusingh's attorney neither attempted to reformulate his query, nor asked the trial judge for a clarification of his ruling.  Instead, the attorney wholly abandoned this particular line of questioning of Carr, and moved on to an unrelated topic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When challenging an exclusionary ruling like the one before us, the aggrieved party must show 1) that a substantial right was affected, and 2) that the \"substance of the evidence [sought to be introduced] was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2).  In the absence of this minimal showing, our review is limited to \"plain error.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 103(d).  In order to show plain error, the complaining party must demonstrate \"that justice has miscarried or that the trial's basic fairness has been compromised.\"  United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 995 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2062, 114 L.Ed.2d 466 (1991).  We find no such error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the question posed by Jadusingh's counsel at trial related solely to Carr's arrest warrants after 1985.  The only evidence in the record regarding Carr's criminal history for this time period is her testimony on direct examination that she had pending traffic violations.  Nothing in the record remotely intimates that further cross-examination on this subject would have uncovered evidence of other wrong-doing on the part of Carr or would have been of any value to Jadusingh.  Nor has Jadusingh offered any information on appeal tending to show that further cross-examination on this subject was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, it is not apparent from the record that the district court intended to restrict Jadusingh's substantive inquiry into Carr's outstanding warrants.  It is equally plausible that the government objected to the argumentative tone of the question.  Thus, we cannot say that the fairness of Jadusingh's trial was affected by the district court's restriction of Jadusingh's cross-examination of Carr.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Admission of Tape Recording</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jadusingh and Whitaker next argue that it was error for the court to permit the jury to listen to the audiotape of the meeting between Carr, Jadusingh, Whitaker and Miller at Jadusingh and Miller's apartment.  In so doing, they contend that the trial court should have excluded the tape because it was inaudible.  Jadusingh further argues that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's reference to the substance of the tape in her closing remarks.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Audibility and Admission of the Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to admit or exclude an audiotape rests with the trial judge, who must decide \"whether 'the inaudible parts are so substantial as to make the rest [of the tape] more misleading than helpful.' \"  United States v. Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 47 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting United States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1986)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 954, 117 L.Ed.2d 122 (1992).  As we have held on numerous occasions, a trial judge's ruling on the admission of recordings is afforded \"broad discretion,\" even where portions of the taped conversation are unintelligible.  See, e.g., Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have listened to the tape and conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in ruling that the tape as a whole was not more misleading than helpful.  Although much of what Jadusingh and Whitaker say is drowned out by intermittent television noise, Carr's words are easily understandable as she repeatedly paraphrases statements made by each defendant to his or her discernable approval.  Furthermore, Carr's audible questions regarding money, travel arrangements and customs are addressed to, and answered by, Jadusingh, thereby corroborating much of Carr's direct testimony that Jadusingh was in control of the overall venture.  See id.   We therefore affirm the district court's admission of this tape.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jadusingh argues that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's substantive reference to the audiotape in her closing remarks.  More specifically, Jadusingh objects to references made by the prosecutor to the jury that statements allegedly made by Jadusingh were audible and that the jury would be able to hear Jadusingh \"speaking about being watchful for dogs that would be sniffing\" at the airport.  Jadusingh, however, failed to object to this reference at trial so, once again, we review for plain error.  See Hadfield, 918 F.2d at 995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to assume that the prosecutor's reference to the tape was erroneous, the reference would not constitute plain error.  First of all, the trial court provided the jury with a limiting instruction directing them to disregard inaudible portions of the tape.  Moreover, Carr testified, independently of the tape, that Jadusingh had, in fact, warned Carr, Whitaker and Miller of customs dogs.  Thus, the very evidence which Jadusingh now objects to had been presented to the jury by an independent source.  Finally, an independent review persuades us that evidence of the dog warnings forms a very small and inconsequential piece of the overall evidence which supports Jadusingh's conviction.  Accordingly, we find no plain error in the government's reference to Jadusingh's inaudible statements on the tape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence of Conspiracy</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Jadusingh and Whitaker argue that there was insufficient evidence to support their convictions for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States from Aruba in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 952 and 963,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and conspiring to possess with intent to distribute the same cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) and 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  This argument need not detain us long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and affirm convictions where any rational juror could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Vavlitis, 9 F.3d 206, 212 (1st Cir.1993).  Conspiracy convictions require proof that the defendants entered into an agreement with one another to commit a crime.  See United States v. Concemi, 957 F.2d 942, 950 (1st Cir.1992).  We note that the government may satisfy this burden by direct and/or circumstantial evidence.  Valencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d at 512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the admission of Carr's testimony and the audiotape was not erroneous, Jadusingh's contention that the government failed to produce evidence sufficient to support his convictions is meritless.  There is a plethora of direct evidence in the record showing that Jadusingh 1) planned the trip to import the cocaine, 2) recruited and controlled Carr, Whitaker and Miller, and 3) provided the travel money and the funds to purchase the cocaine.  Moreover, DEA agents observed Jadusingh traveling to Puerto Rico.  They listened in on at least one telephone conversation between Jadusingh and Carr while Carr, Whitaker and Miller were in Curacao.  And they also observed Jadusingh attempting to purchase an airplane ticket, thereby corroborating Carr's testimony that Jadusingh wanted to meet the women in St. Thomas.  Moreover, additional evidence shows that Jadusingh promised to pay the women $1000 each for their efforts and that the women were instructed to deliver cocaine valued at over three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) wholesale to Jadusingh.  Thus, the evidence produced by the government supports a reasonable inference that Jadusingh 1) agreed with Whitaker and Miller to commit the charged offenses;  2) had constructive possession of cocaine;  3) intended to distribute the cocaine, see United States v. Vargas, 945 F.2d 426, 428-29 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that one kilogram of cocaine was \"large enough to support a fair jury inference that it was not intended merely for personal consumption\"), and 4) controlled those who actually imported the cocaine into the United States from Aruba.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitaker's sufficiency argument is based mainly on her claim that the Customs Inspector who searched her at the Marin Airport in San Juan could not identify her at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  We fail to discern any merit in this argument.  Whitaker was identified in court by Carr as one of the coconspirators who planned the trip, handled the money, divided up the cocaine, and attempted to smuggle the drug into the United States from Aruba.  Whitaker also was identified in court by DEA agent Johnson, who received custody of Whitaker from Maldonado at the airport, as one of two women who were apprehended deplaning a flight from Aruba with cocaine strapped to their stomachs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the abundance of evidence supporting the convictions of both Jadusingh and Whitaker, we decline the invitation to upset the jury's findings of their respective guilt as to either count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Sentencing Enhancements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jadusingh contends that the evidence presented was insufficient to uphold the trial court's two-level sentencing enhancement for his organizational role in the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Again, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An enhancement under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1 is appropriate if the government has demonstrated that the defendant \" 'exercised some degree of control over others involved in the commission of the crime.' \"  United States v. De La Cruz, 996 F.2d 1307, 1315 (1st Cir.)  (quoting United States v. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217 (1st Cir.1990)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 356, 126 L.Ed.2d 320 (1993).  We review role-in-the-offense rulings for clear error.  United States v. Cronin, 990 F.2d 663, 665 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the sentencing judge based his decision to enhance Jadusingh's sentence upon a reading of the pre-sentence report, and his notes from, and memory of, the trial.  The district judge was afforded ample opportunity to ascertain the credibility of Donna Carr as she testified to Jadusingh's control over the drug operation.  The record is replete with testimony from Carr that Jadusingh planned and financed the trips to Puerto Rico and Curacao.  According to Carr, Jadusingh directed the women's actions.  He showed them 1) how to divide up and package the cocaine, 2) how to strap it to their bodies, and 3) how to avoid detection at customs.  Jadusingh also provided the money to pay for the trip and the drugs.  This evidence clearly supports a finding that Jadusingh was the \"mastermind behind this offense.\"   Accordingly, we find no clear error in the trial judge's two-level enhancement of Jadusingh's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his supplemental pro se brief, Jadusingh urges this court to consider his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.  Generally, we will not address such a claim raised for the first time on direct appeal unless \"the critical facts are not in dispute and a sufficiently developed record exists.\"  United States v. Daniels, 3 F.3d 25, 26-27 (1st Cir.1993).  The proper forum for factbound issues of ineffective assistance of counsel is in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.

Furthermore, the laundry list of counsel's alleged failures, including the failure to call witnesses, to voir dire the jury, to request a severance and to strike apparent contradictory statements of the government's confidential informant, are sufficiently factbound to preclude our review on the record before us.  See id.   Accordingly, we decline the invitation to review this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment below is affirmed, without prejudice to defendant Jadusingh's right to pursue his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C.

See United  States v. Wallach, 935 F.2d 445 (2d Cir.1991) (reversing conviction where government knowingly allowed star witness to perjure himself).  Having carefully reviewed all of the alleged \"inconsistencies\" adduced in support of this argument, however, we find it to be baseless</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Jadusingh also charges that the district court's ruling violated his right to confront Carr in violation of the Sixth Amendment.  We fail to see the merit of this argument.  A criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him/her is not absolute.  It may, of course, be violated when the defendant is prohibited from engaging in cross-examination which is not repetitive, harassing or otherwise improper, but, rather, is designed to show a \"prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness and thereby to expose to the jury information on the witness's reliability.\"  United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 759 (1st Cir.1991).  Here, the question posed by Jadusingh's counsel was argumentative and, therefore, properly excluded as improper cross-examination.  See id. at 760</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Jadusingh also argues that the tape should have been excluded because the government neither provided a written transcript nor established a chain of custody.  As to the first of these arguments, it is established that \"a transcript is not a prerequisite for the admission of recorded conversations.\"  United States v. Panzardi-Lespier, 918 F.2d 313, 319 (1st Cir.1990).  As to the second argument, we agree with the Second Circuit that, once the government has established both authenticity and accuracy, sufficient foundation has been laid for the tape's admission without proof of chain-of-custody.  See United States v. Steinberg, 551 F.2d 510, 515 (2d Cir.1977).  We note that the government, through Carr, properly authenticated the tape and identified the voices.  See Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 47</p>\n        <p>Whitaker argues that the court erred in allowing the jury to listen to the tape because it was never formally moved into evidence.  Because Whitaker failed to raise this objection below, we review this argument under a plainly erroneous standard.  See United States v. Brennan, 994 F.2d 918, 925 (1st Cir.1993).  We fail to see how the government's failure to move the tape formally into evidence affected the fundamental fairness of the trial where 1) the government provided the proper foundation to admit the tape, 2) the trial court ruled that the government could play the tape for the jury, and 3) the tape was docketed as Government Exhibit 17.  We therefore reject this argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C.

Secs. 952 and 963.  Appellants also were convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute the same cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) and 846.  On appeal, both raise a host of challenges to their convictions.  Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions, we summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.  See, e.g., United States v. Mena-Robles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194956\"><a href=\"/opinion/194956/united-states-v-mena-robles/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span>, 1029 (1st Cir.1993).  Donna Marie Carr is the mother of Kimberly Miller.  In the summer of 1991, Carr was approached by Miller's boyfriend, Desmond Jadusingh, and asked to participate in an international drug smuggling venture.  Jadusingh wanted Carr to travel with two couriers he had recruited, Miller and Karen Whitaker, so that Carr could learn the operation and step in if either Miller or Whitaker backed out.  The trip was planned for January 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the date of departure drew near, Carr approached Pittsfield, Massachusetts, police officer Timothy Surrell about the venture.  He, in turn, alerted the Massachusetts Drug Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\") and arranged for two MDEA agents to join him in a meeting with Carr.  The group gathered at a local restaurant, where Carr told Surrell and the agents that she would be meeting with Jadusingh later in the day to finalize the arrangements.  Fearing that she would not remember all of the anticipated conversation, Carr volunteered to wear a concealed wire to the rendezvous at Jadusingh and Miller's apartment.  That evening, Carr recorded a conversation in which Jadusingh, Whitaker and Miller discussed their plans to travel to Puerto Rico to purchase and import two kilograms of cocaine.  Meanwhile, DEA agents and local police, in a nearby parking lot, listened to the live transmission of the conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two days later, on January 16, 1992, Carr drove Jadusingh, Whitaker and Miller from Pittsfield to Jadusingh's house on Long Island, New York, where Jadusingh gathered money and clothing for the trip.  The following morning, Jadusingh's brother drove all four to Kennedy International Airport, where they boarded a plane for Puerto Rico.  Upon arrival, the group, under surveillance by officers of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\"), traveled to the Holiday Inn Crown Plaza in Carolina, Puerto Rico.  All three of the women stayed in room 519 while Jadusingh, who wanted to keep his distance from the women, stayed in room 309, which was registered to a Karen Bailey.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Whitaker and Carr were instructed by Jadusingh not to mention his name in public and to contact him only by phone.  They were provided a telephone credit card number to charge calls as needed.  For the most part, Jadusingh rationed out instructions and money through Miller on an as-needed basis.  He also demanded receipts for all expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after arriving in Puerto Rico, the group was informed by its drug contact, Etlyn, that there was an unexpected change of plans.  Jadusingh's cocaine had not been unloaded in Puerto Rico as expected, and would have to be picked up in Curacao.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  While Jadusingh remained in Puerto Rico, the three women, accompanied by surveilling undercover DEA agents, traveled to Curacao to pick up the cocaine.  Once there, Miller met with a man known only as Junior and exchanged $5800 of Jadusingh's money for approximately two kilograms of cocaine.  In an attempt to compensate for the unplanned detour, Junior promised an additional two kilograms of cocaine and instructed the women to change hotels and await delivery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Miller and Whitaker purchased razor blades, plastic baggies, tape and girdles.  With the help of Carr, the two women divided and packed the cocaine according to Jadusingh's instructions.  Jadusingh, who was in frequent phone contact with his couriers, directed them to bring the cocaine back to the United States by way of St. Martin and St. Thomas.  According to Jadusingh, smuggling cocaine through customs in St. Thomas was easier than through customs in Puerto Rico.  When Jadusingh subsequently discovered that he could not fly to St. Thomas without a passport, however, he told the women to abandon Junior's additional delivery and return immediately to the Holiday Inn in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 23, 1992, Miller and Whitaker taped the baggies containing the cocaine to their stomachs and further secured the contraband with the girdles.  Together with Carr, they boarded a plane bound for Aruba.  After spending the night in Aruba, Miller and Whitaker again secured the cocaine to their bodies and boarded a plane for Puerto Rico.  Meanwhile, at Puerto Rico's Luis Munoz Marin International Airport, Senior Customs Inspector Sonia Maldonado was alerted by DEA agents that two persons would be arriving from Aruba with contraband.  Maldonado, who was not told which passengers would be carrying the drugs, became suspicious of Whitaker and Miller because they were wearing bulky winter jackets on what she described as a particularly hot day.  A personal search of Whitaker by Maldonado and of Miller by Senior Customs Inspector Maria Esquilin uncovered approximately two kilograms of a concealed white powder which was field tested and found to be cocaine.  After completing the search, Maldonado delivered Whitaker to DEA agent Eric Johnson.  Jadusingh was arrested at the Holiday Inn later that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 5, 1992, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Jadusingh, Miller and Whitaker.  Count one charged the defendants with conspiracy to import cocaine from Aruba to the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 952 and 963.  Count two charged the defendants with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute the same cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) and 846.  The defendants pled not guilty at their arraignment.  Jadusingh and Whitaker were tried without Miller, who fled after being released on bail and was later arrested and tried separately.  Carr was the government's lead witness at the trial.  Jadusingh and Whitaker were convicted on both conspiracy counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Jadusingh and Whitaker together primarily argue:  (1) the court erred in allowing Donna Carr to testify;  (2) the court impermissibly admitted an audiotape into evidence;  and (3) the court erred in denying their respective Rule 29 motions for acquittal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Jadusingh further contends 1) that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence, and 2) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Donna Carr</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jadusingh and Whitaker argue that the district court erred in allowing Donna Carr, the government's confidential informant and lead witness, to testify.  Specifically, the defendants claim (1) that the court should have excluded Carr's testimony because the government failed to disclose Carr's criminal history in violation of Brady v. Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span> (1963);  and (2) that the trial judge precluded Jadusingh's attorney from effectively cross-examining Carr.  We find both of these arguments to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Brady Violations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Brady, the Supreme Court held that \"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\"  Id. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-1197.   The purpose of the Brady rule is \"to prohibit the prosecution from intentionally withholding 'evidence favorable to the accused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial.' \"  United States v. Valencia-Lucena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555764\"><a href=\"/opinion/555764/united-states-v-carlos-valencia-lucena-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 514 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting United States v.

(quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 675, 105 S.Ct. at 3380).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was no Brady violation.  Although the government did not disclose Carr's 1978 misdemeanor drug conviction until just before the start of the first day of trial, it is uncontested that the government did not actually learn of this conviction until that same day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Moreover, Carr's other past substance abuse and outstanding traffic violations were fully disclosed during the direct and cross-examination of Carr at trial.  Given this full disclosure of Carr's background by the government, we are at a loss to comprehend defendant's argument that the government committed a Brady violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See id. at 514 (government failure to turn over evidence of confidential informant's drug use was not Brady violation where issue was fully revealed at trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Cross Examination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jadusingh next argues that the trial judge unfairly limited the scope of his cross-examination of Carr.  In support of this argument, however, Jadusingh offers only the following colloquy between his lawyer and Carr:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

Instead, the attorney wholly abandoned this particular line of questioning of Carr, and moved on to an unrelated topic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When challenging an exclusionary ruling like the one before us, the aggrieved party must show 1) that a substantial right was affected, and 2) that the \"substance of the evidence [sought to be introduced] was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2).  In the absence of this minimal showing, our review is limited to \"plain error.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 103(d).  In order to show plain error, the complaining party must demonstrate \"that justice has miscarried or that the trial's basic fairness has been compromised.\"  United States v. Hadfield, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551471\"><a href=\"/opinion/551471/united-states-v-royal-w-hadfield-jr-united-states-of-america-v-helen/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 995 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></span> (1991).  We find no such error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the question posed by Jadusingh's counsel at trial related solely to Carr's arrest warrants after 1985.  The only evidence in the record regarding Carr's criminal history for this time period is her testimony on direct examination that she had pending traffic violations.  Nothing in the record remotely intimates that further cross-examination on this subject would have uncovered evidence of other wrong-doing on the part of Carr or would have been of any value to Jadusingh.

It is equally plausible that the government objected to the argumentative tone of the question.  Thus, we cannot say that the fairness of Jadusingh's trial was affected by the district court's restriction of Jadusingh's cross-examination of Carr.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Admission of Tape Recording</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jadusingh and Whitaker next argue that it was error for the court to permit the jury to listen to the audiotape of the meeting between Carr, Jadusingh, Whitaker and Miller at Jadusingh and Miller's apartment.  In so doing, they contend that the trial court should have excluded the tape because it was inaudible.  Jadusingh further argues that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's reference to the substance of the tape in her closing remarks.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Audibility and Admission of the Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to admit or exclude an audiotape rests with the trial judge, who must decide \"whether 'the inaudible parts are so substantial as to make the rest [of the tape] more misleading than helpful.' \"  United States v. Font-Ramirez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567923\"><a href=\"/opinion/567923/united-states-v-octavio-font-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></span> (1992).  As we have held on numerous occasions, a trial judge's ruling on the admission of recordings is afforded \"broad discretion,\" even where portions of the taped conversation are unintelligible.  See, e.g., Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have listened to the tape and conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in ruling that the tape as a whole was not more misleading than helpful.  Although much of what Jadusingh and Whitaker say is drowned out by intermittent television noise, Carr's words are easily understandable as she repeatedly paraphrases statements made by each defendant to his or her discernable approval.  Furthermore, Carr's audible questions regarding money, travel arrangements and customs are addressed to, and answered by, Jadusingh, thereby corroborating much of Carr's direct testimony that Jadusingh was in control of the overall venture.  See id.   We therefore affirm the district court's admission of this tape.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jadusingh argues that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's substantive reference to the audiotape in her closing remarks.  More specifically, Jadusingh objects to references made by the prosecutor to the jury that statements allegedly made by Jadusingh were audible and that the jury would be able to hear Jadusingh \"speaking about being watchful for dogs that would be sniffing\" at the airport.  Jadusingh, however, failed to object to this reference at trial so, once again, we review for plain error.  See Hadfield, 918 F.2d at 995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to assume that the prosecutor's reference to the tape was erroneous, the reference would not constitute plain error.  First of all, the trial court provided the jury with a limiting instruction directing them to disregard inaudible portions of the tape.  Moreover, Carr testified, independently of the tape, that Jadusingh had, in fact, warned Carr, Whitaker and Miller of customs dogs.  Thus, the very evidence which Jadusingh now objects to had been presented to the jury by an independent source.  Finally, an independent review persuades us that evidence of the dog warnings forms a very small and inconsequential piece of the overall evidence which supports Jadusingh's conviction.  Accordingly, we find no plain error in the government's reference to Jadusingh's inaudible statements on the tape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence of Conspiracy</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Jadusingh and Whitaker argue that there was insufficient evidence to support their convictions for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States from Aruba in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 952 and 963,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and conspiring to possess with intent to distribute the same cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) and 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  This argument need not detain us long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and affirm convictions where any rational juror could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Vavlitis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195045\"><a href=\"/opinion/195045/united-states-v-vavlitis/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 212 (1st Cir.1993).  Conspiracy convictions require proof that the defendants entered into an agreement with one another to commit a crime.  See United States v. Concemi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578607\"><a href=\"/opinion/578607/united-states-v-samuel-j-concemi-united-states-of-america-v-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 950 (1st Cir.1992).  We note that the government may satisfy this burden by direct and/or circumstantial evidence.  Valencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d at 512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the admission of Carr's testimony and the audiotape was not erroneous, Jadusingh's contention that the government failed to produce evidence sufficient to support his convictions is meritless.  There is a plethora of direct evidence in the record showing that Jadusingh 1) planned the trip to import the cocaine, 2) recruited and controlled Carr, Whitaker and Miller, and 3) provided the travel money and the funds to purchase the cocaine.  Moreover, DEA agents observed Jadusingh traveling to Puerto Rico.  They listened in on at least one telephone conversation between Jadusingh and Carr while Carr, Whitaker and Miller were in Curacao.  And they also observed Jadusingh attempting to purchase an airplane ticket, thereby corroborating Carr's testimony that Jadusingh wanted to meet the women in St. Thomas.  Moreover, additional evidence shows that Jadusingh promised to pay the women $1000 each for their efforts and that the women were instructed to deliver cocaine valued at over three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) wholesale to Jadusingh.  Thus, the evidence produced by the government supports a reasonable inference that Jadusingh 1) agreed with Whitaker and Miller to commit the charged offenses;  2) had constructive possession of cocaine;  3) intended to distribute the cocaine, see United States v. Vargas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569088\"><a href=\"/opinion/569088/united-states-v-ramiro-vargas/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 428-29 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that one kilogram of cocaine was \"large enough to support a fair jury inference that it was not intended merely for personal consumption\"), and 4) controlled those who actually imported the cocaine into the United States from Aruba.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitaker's sufficiency argument is based mainly on her claim that the Customs Inspector who searched her at the Marin Airport in San Juan could not identify her at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  We fail to discern any merit in this argument.  Whitaker was identified in court by Carr as one of the coconspirators who planned the trip, handled the money, divided up the cocaine, and attempted to smuggle the drug into the United States from Aruba.  Whitaker also was identified in court by DEA agent Johnson, who received custody of Whitaker from Maldonado at the airport, as one of two women who were apprehended deplaning a flight from Aruba with cocaine strapped to their stomachs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the abundance of evidence supporting the convictions of both Jadusingh and Whitaker, we decline the invitation to upset the jury's findings of their respective guilt as to either count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Sentencing Enhancements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jadusingh contends that the evidence presented was insufficient to uphold the trial court's two-level sentencing enhancement for his organizational role in the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Again, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An enhancement under U.S.S.G.

The district judge was afforded ample opportunity to ascertain the credibility of Donna Carr as she testified to Jadusingh's control over the drug operation.  The record is replete with testimony from Carr that Jadusingh planned and financed the trips to Puerto Rico and Curacao.  According to Carr, Jadusingh directed the women's actions.  He showed them 1) how to divide up and package the cocaine, 2) how to strap it to their bodies, and 3) how to avoid detection at customs.  Jadusingh also provided the money to pay for the trip and the drugs.  This evidence clearly supports a finding that Jadusingh was the \"mastermind behind this offense.\"   Accordingly, we find no clear error in the trial judge's two-level enhancement of Jadusingh's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.

See United  States v. Wallach, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562616\"><a href=\"/opinion/562616/united-states-v-wallach-rusty-kent-london-eugene-robert-wallach-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1991) (reversing conviction where government knowingly allowed star witness to perjure himself).  Having carefully reviewed all of the alleged \"inconsistencies\" adduced in support of this argument, however, we find it to be baseless</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Jadusingh also charges that the district court's ruling violated his right to confront Carr in violation of the Sixth Amendment.  We fail to see the merit of this argument.  A criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him/her is not absolute.  It may, of course, be violated when the defendant is prohibited from engaging in cross-examination which is not repetitive, harassing or otherwise improper, but, rather, is designed to show a \"prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness and thereby to expose to the jury information on the witness's reliability.\"  United States v. Osorio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558564\"><a href=\"/opinion/558564/united-states-v-lorenzo-osorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span>, 759 (1st Cir.1991).  Here, the question posed by Jadusingh's counsel was argumentative and, therefore, properly excluded as improper cross-examination.  See id. at 760</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Jadusingh also argues that the tape should have been excluded because the government neither provided a written transcript nor established a chain of custody.  As to the first of these arguments, it is established that \"a transcript is not a prerequisite for the admission of recorded conversations.\"  United States v. Panzardi-Lespier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551283\"><a href=\"/opinion/551283/united-states-v-santiago-panzardi-lespier-aka-chago/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 319 (1st Cir.1990).  As to the second argument, we agree with the Second Circuit that, once the government has established both authenticity and accuracy, sufficient foundation has been laid for the tape's admission without proof of chain-of-custody.  See United States v. Steinberg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"344039\"><a href=\"/opinion/344039/united-states-v-fred-steinberg-and-dennis-riese/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 515 (2d Cir.1977).  We note that the government, through Carr, properly authenticated the tape and identified the voices.  See Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 47</p>\n        <p>Whitaker argues that the court erred in allowing the jury to listen to the tape because it was never formally moved into evidence.  Because Whitaker failed to raise this objection below, we review this argument under a plainly erroneous standard.  See United States v. Brennan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608079\"><a href=\"/opinion/608079/united-states-v-james-f-brennan-united-states-v-j-edward-mchugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span>, 925 (1st Cir.1993).  We fail to see how the government's failure to move the tape formally into evidence affected the fundamental fairness of the trial where 1) the government provided the proper foundation to admit the tape, 2) the trial court ruled that the government could play the tape for the jury, and 3) the tape was docketed as Government Exhibit 17.  We therefore reject this argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C.
