Wesley Spratt (\"Spratt\") is a\n\nprisoner in the Adult Correctional Institution (\"ACI\") in Rhode\n\nIsland. After prison officials prohibited Spratt from preaching to\n\nhis   fellow   inmates,   he    filed   suit    against       the    Rhode    Island\n\nDepartment     of    Corrections     and      its   director,          A.T.    Wall\n\n(collectively,      \"RIDOC\")    under   the     Religious       Land     Use    and\n\nInstitutionalized     Persons    Act,    42    U.S.C.     §    2000cc    et    seq.\n\n(\"RLUIPA\").    The district court granted summary judgment to RIDOC.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we reverse and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n           Spratt is a prisoner in the maximum security unit and is\n\nserving a life sentence for murder.           See State v. Spratt, 742 A.2d\n\n1194 (R.I. 1999). In 1995, Spratt underwent a religious awakening,\n\nand began attending Christian services at the ACI.                  Impressed with\n\nhis commitment and devotion, the prison chaplains began allowing\n\nSpratt to preach1 to inmates during weekly services.                     In 2000,\n\nSpratt was ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church.\n\nFrom 1995 until 2003, no prison official interfered with Spratt's\n\nreligious activities.2     Spratt's preaching during this seven year\n\n\n1\n   To be clear, we use the word \"preach\" to refer to the activity\nof commenting or expounding upon some religious text.        RIDOC\ncontinues to allow Spratt to read scripture aloud during religious\nservices so long as he does not add any commentary.\n2\n    RIDOC suggests that the then-warden of the prison, Warden\nWhitman, may not have been aware of Spratt's preaching. However,\n\n                                     -2-\n\fperiod did not lead to any apparent disciplinary problems at the\n\nACI.\n\n           In 2003, then-Warden Whitman was replaced by Warden\n\nWeeden, who remains the warden of the ACI.      On October 15, 2003,\n\nSpratt was told by a correctional officer that he was no longer\n\nallowed to preach in the chapel.       When Spratt approached Warden\n\nWeeden about the matter, he was told that preaching by prisoners\n\nwas not allowed under prison regulations.      Spratt formalized his\n\ncomplaint in writing, and Warden Weeden responded that inmate\n\npreaching was prohibited by RIDOC Policy # 26.01-2DOC, which states\n\nthat all religious services are scheduled, supervised, and directed\n\nby institutional chaplains.3   Weeden also informed Spratt that if\n\nhe was found to be preaching, he would be subject to disciplinary\n\naction.   Spratt then filed a complaint with A.T. Wall, director of\n\nRIDOC, stating the aforementioned facts, and asking that Wall allow\n\nhim to preach.   Wall responded in a letter dated December 15, 2003,\n\nwhich states:\n\n\n\n\nSpratt stated in an affidavit, uncontroverted by RIDOC, that his\npreaching was openly known to other prison officials, and that he\nproudly spoke about his preaching activities during his yearly\nclassification reviews.\n3\n   This policy, however, does not address the issue of whether\ninmates may participate in religious services under the supervision\nof approved clergy, as was the case with Spratt.       We defer to\nRIDOC's interpretation of this policy to prohibit an inmate from\nexpounding upon the scripture, but not to prohibit an inmate from\nreading religious texts without commentary.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f             Mr. Spratt, you do have the right to practice\n             your religion under the constitution subject\n             to reasonable restrictions. Because you are\n             not an acknowledged member of the clergy, you\n             do not have the right to proselytize or preach\n             to the inmate population.     Therefore, your\n             request for my intervention is denied.\n\n             Spratt proceeded to file a pro se complaint against Wall\n\nand RIDOC in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nRhode Island, asking for relief under the First Amendment, the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000bb-1(C) (\"RFRA\").4        Spratt's complaint stated that the\n\nprison policy prohibiting inmate preaching did not satisfy the\n\n\"least restrictive means\" test in RFRA, and asked for declaratory\n\nrelief, injunctive relief, and damages of $40.29 (the cost of legal\n\npaper and copies).     RIDOC filed an answer stating that they lacked\n\nsufficient information to admit or deny Spratt's allegations, but\n\nasserted various affirmative defenses.             Spratt moved for summary\n\njudgment, attaching various letters from prison clergy attesting to\n\nhis skill as a preacher, his minister's certificate, and the\n\naforementioned correspondence between himself and prison officials.\n\nRIDOC responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment, asking\n\nthat   the   claims   against   Wall    in   his   individual   capacity   be\n\n\n4\n  Spratt initially filed suit under RFRA. However, RFRA was found\nto be unconstitutional as applied to purely state (as opposed to\nfederal) action in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997).\nIn its response to Spratt's complaint, RIDOC noted that Spratt\nwould likely refile his complaint under RLUIPA. Since then, the\ndistrict court and the parties have treated Spratt's complaint as\narising out of RLUIPA. We do not disturb this decision.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fdismissed,5 and arguing that RIDOC had satisfied the requirements\n\nof   RLUIPA      because   (a)   Spratt's      religious    exercise    was    not\n\nsubstantially burdened and (b) even if it was burdened, RIDOC had\n\na compelling state interest which was accomplished by the least\n\nrestrictive means.         RIDOC attached to their motion for summary\n\njudgment a \"statement of undisputed facts,\" which acknowledged that\n\n\"no material facts are in dispute in this matter.\"\n\n            The case was referred to a magistrate judge, who filed a\n\nreport    and    recommendation    granting     RIDOC     summary   judgment    on\n\nSpratt's First and Fourteenth Amendment claims,6 and staying the\n\nRLUIPA claim pending the Supreme Court's resolution of Cutter v.\n\nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 722-24 (2005), which considered various\n\nconstitutional challenges to RLUIPA.\n\n            After Cutter rejected the constitutional challenges to\n\nRLUIPA,    the    magistrate     judge    ordered   the    parties     to   submit\n\nadditional briefing as to whether RLUIPA was applicable to RIDOC,\n\nand as to the merits of Spratt's RLUIPA claim.               RIDOC submitted a\n\nsupplemental memorandum acknowledging that it was subject to RLUIPA\n\nbecause it accepted federal funding, and attached an affidavit from\n\nJake Gadsden, Assistant Director of Operations for the Rhode Island\n\n\n5\n   This argument was never addressed by the district court, and we\nexpress no opinion as to its merit.\n6\n   Spratt filed an interlocutory appeal of this judgment, which we\ndenied on April 4, 2006. Spratt v. Walls, No. 05-1583 (1st Cir.\nApr. 4, 2006).     Spratt does not appeal the grant of summary\njudgment on these claims.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fDepartment of Corrections. The affidavit briefly reviews Gadsden's\n\nprofessional experience, and states that inmates may not lead\n\nreligious services in RIDOC facilities.        Gadsden explains in the\n\naffidavit that inmate preaching could be dangerous because \"placing\n\nan inmate in a position of actual or perceived leadership before an\n\ninmate group threatens security, as it provides the perceived\n\ninmate leader with influence within the administration.\"       Gadsden\n\nfurther states in the affidavit that \"there is no less restrictive\n\nmanner to accommodate Spratt's desire to preach to an inmate\n\ncongregation, other than an outright ban,\" because even an inmate\n\npreaching under RIDOC supervision would be perceived as having\n\ninfluence. Finally, the affidavit states that Gadsden was familiar\n\nwith a program in the Texas Correctional System which he identified\n\nas the \"trustee\" program, in which inmates were given certain\n\nleadership roles.    Gadsden states that Texas abolished the program\n\nbecause the inmate leaders abused their positions to garner favors\n\nfrom fellow inmates.\n\n           Spratt filed an affidavit in response, which states that\n\nhe   acknowledges   Gadsden's   \"noteworthy\"   credentials,   but   that\n\nGadsden's conclusions are \"exaggerat[ion] and speculation.\" Spratt\n\nalso stated in a memorandum of law that he would willingly submit\n\nto further RIDOC supervision of his preaching activities.      He also\n\nsuggested that RIDOC could retain their policy against inmate\n\npreaching but grant limited exemptions when enforcement of the\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fpolicy would result in a violation of RLUIPA.          Spratt noted that\n\nRIDOC allows inmates to congregate and talk freely about non-\n\nreligious topics during recreational time, and that this had not\n\nbeen found to pose a threat to prison security.\n\n          The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation\n\ngranting RIDOC summary judgment on Spratt's RLUIPA claim.                The\n\nreport found that Spratt had satisfied the first two elements of\n\nthe RLUIPA test: that preaching was part of Spratt's religious\n\nexercise and that the religious exercise had been substantially\n\nburdened by the RIDOC prohibition.        However, the magistrate judge\n\nconcluded that RIDOC had established that inmate security was a\n\ncompelling   state   interest,   and   that   the   total   ban   on   inmate\n\npreaching was the least restrictive means by which to accomplish\n\nthat goal.\n\n          Spratt objected to the magistrate judge's report and\n\nrecommendation, and the issue was referred to a district judge.\n\nThe court held a hearing on the objection on April 6, 2006.            At the\n\nhearing on Spratt's objection, Spratt was represented by counsel\n\nfrom the ACLU of Rhode Island.           During the hearing, the court\n\ninitially seemed skeptical of RIDOC's claim that the Gadsden\n\naffidavit was sufficient to overcome summary judgment, stating,\n\n\"What evidence do I have?        See, that's the problem here.          What\n\nevidence is in the record that says it's got to be a total ban.\n\nThere's just no other solution.          I'm looking at this very high\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fburden and very little evidence.\"       Nevertheless, the court adopted\n\nand affirmed the magistrate judge's report and recommendation,\n\nnoting that \"while the issue is somewhat of a close call, the\n\nMagistrate   Judge's   [report    and     recommendation]   on   balance\n\nrepresents both a fair and reasonable interpretation of the RLUIPA\n\nclaim.\"\n\n                             II. Analysis\n\n          A. Standard of Review\n\n          We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing\n\nthe record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n\nIverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate only if there are no material\n\ndisputes of fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.    Id.\n\n          B. RLUIPA\n\n          RLUIPA was enacted in 2000 as a response to the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in City of Boerne v. Flores, which partially\n\nstruck down the previously enacted Religious Freedom Restoration\n\nAct on the grounds that it exceeded Congress' power to regulate the\n\nstates under the Fourteenth Amendment. 521 U.S. 507, 529-36 (1997)\n\n(holding that RFRA may not be applied to purely state, as opposed\n\nto federal, action).    Whereas RFRA had applied to all action by\n\n\"Government,\" RLUIPA is substantially narrower in scope, and the\n\nportion of that statute at issue in this case applies only to \"a\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fprogram or activity [in an institution] that receives Federal\n\nfinancial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(1). Substantively,\n\nRLUIPA provides that\n\n           No government shall impose a substantial\n           burden on the religious exercise of a person\n           residing in or confined to an institution, as\n           defined in [42 U.S.C. § 1997], even if the\n           burden results from a rule of general\n           applicability,    unless    the    government\n           demonstrates that imposition of the burden on\n           that person--\n\n                    (1) is in furtherance of a compelling\n                    governmental interest; and\n                    (2) is the least restrictive means of\n                    furthering that compelling governmental\n                    interest.\n\nId. § 2000cc-1(a).          Thus, a claim under RLUIPA includes four\n\nelements. On the first two elements, (1) that an institutionalized\n\nperson's religious exercise has been burdened and (2) that the\n\nburden is substantial, the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.\n\nId. § 2000cc-2(b).      Once a plaintiff has established that his\n\nreligious exercise has been substantially burdened, the onus shifts\n\nto the government to show (3) that the burden furthers a compelling\n\ngovernmental     interest    and   (4)   that   the     burden    is     the   least\n\nrestrictive means of achieving that compelling interest.                   Id.\n\n                    1. Spratt's Burden\n\n           For purposes of this appeal, the state does not seriously\n\ndispute   that    Spratt's    evidence     on   his    prima     facie    case   is\n\nsufficient to survive summary judgment.               As an inmate in a state\n\ncorrectional facility, Spratt is an institutionalized person within\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthe    definition    of     RLUIPA.        See   id.   §   1997(1)   (\"The    term\n\n'institution' means any facility or institution--(A) which is\n\nowned, operated, or managed by, or provides services on behalf of\n\nany State or political subdivision of a State; and (B) which\n\nis--(ii) a jail, prison, or other correctional facility . . . .\").\n\nFurthermore, it is clear that preaching is a form of religious\n\nexercise.     See McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.S. 618, 626 (1978) (\"[T]he\n\nright to the free exercise of religion unquestionably encompasses\n\nthe right to preach, proselyte, and perform other similar religious\n\nfunctions.\").\n\n             As to the second prong, RIDOC devotes a footnote in its\n\nbrief to suggesting that           Spratt's \"exercise of . . . religion in\n\ngeneral is not being substantially burdened.\" Appellees' Br. at 11\n\nn.6.     RIDOC     points    out    that    \"Spratt    may   still   attend     and\n\nparticipate in religious services.               He may pray, sing, or recite\n\nduring such services just as every other inmate may.\"                Id.   We have\n\nnot    yet   had    the   opportunity       to   define    what   constitutes    a\n\n\"substantial burden\" under RLUIPA. The district court decided that\n\na \"substantial burden\" is one that \"put[s] substantial pressure on\n\nan adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs,\"\n\nciting Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana Employment Security\n\nDivision, 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981); see also Lovelace v. Lee, 472\n\nF.3d 174, 187 (4th Cir. 2006) (applying the Thomas standard in a\n\nRLUIPA case). Assuming arguendo that Thomas applies, RIDOC has not\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fon this appeal seriously contested the issue and Spratt has stated\n\nthat RIDOC will not allow him to preach anytime or anywhere,\n\nthreatening that if he does so, he will be subject to disciplinary\n\nsanctions.     As such, for the purposes of this appeal, Spratt has\n\nmade a prima facie showing that his religious exercise has been\n\nsubstantially burdened.\n\n                      2. RIDOC's Burden\n\n             The burden thus shifts to RIDOC to demonstrate that its\n\nban   on   inmate    preaching,       as    applied    to   Spratt,     furthers   a\n\n\"compelling governmental interest\" and is the least restrictive\n\nmeans of achieving that interest.              42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1.         We are\n\nmindful, however, that in passing RLUIPA, Congress stated that we\n\nshould continue to give \"due deference to the experience and\n\nexpertise of prison and jail administrators\" in determining prison\n\npolicy.      Cutter,     544   U.S.    at    717   (internal     quotation    marks\n\nomitted)(quoting 146 Cong. Rec. S7774, S7775 (daily ed. July 27,\n\n2000) (joint statement of Sens. Hatch and Kennedy on RLUIPA)).\n\nHowever,     as    the   Congressional         sponsors     of   RLUIPA    stated,\n\n\"inadequately formulated prison regulations and policies grounded\n\non    mere        speculation,    exaggerated           fears,     or     post-hoc\n\nrationalizations will not suffice to meet the act's requirements.\"\n\n146 Cong. Rec. at S7775 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n             RIDOC asserts that it has a compelling state interest in\n\nmaintaining prison security.               We agree.    See, e.g., Cutter, 544\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fU.S. at 725 n.13 (\"It bears repetition . . . that prison security\n\nis a compelling state interest, and that deference is due to\n\ninstitutional officials' expertise in this area.\").              However,\n\nmerely stating a compelling interest does not fully satisfy RIDOC's\n\nburden on this element of RLUIPA; RIDOC must also establish that\n\nprison security is furthered by barring Wesley Spratt from engaging\n\nin any preaching at any time.\n\n          RIDOC has offered just one piece of evidence to support\n\nthis assertion: the Gadsden affidavit.7          This affidavit, which\n\ncites no studies and discusses no research in support of its\n\nposition, simply describes the equation thus: if Spratt is a\n\npreacher, he is a leader; having leaders in prison (even those\n\nsanctioned   by    the   administration)   is   detrimental    to   prison\n\nsecurity; thus, Spratt's preaching activity is detrimental to\n\nprison security.    But to prevail on summary judgment, RIDOC \"must\n\ndo more than merely assert a security concern.\"          Murphy v. Mo.\n\nDep't of Corr., 372 F.3d 979, 988 (8th Cir. 2004).            The Gadsden\n\naffidavit offers only one reference to another prison in support of\n\nits assertion that inmate preaching is a security concern: the\n\n\n7\n   Spratt also objects that the Gadsden affidavit does not satisfy\nthe requirement that an expert affidavit \"include the factual basis\nand the process of reasoning which makes the conclusion viable.\"\nHayes v. Douglas Dynamics, 8 F.3d 88, 92 (1st Cir. 1993). Because\nwe find that the affidavit does not provide sufficient evidence to\nsustain RIDOC's burden under RLUIPA, we need not address this issue\nnow.    However, we suggest that on remand, the district court\ndetermine whether the Gadsden affidavit satisfies the requirements\nfor the admissibility of an expert affidavit.\n\n                                  -12-\n\faffidavit mentions a situation in Texas which was described as a\n\n\"trustee\" system.      We believe that Gadsden was referring to the\n\n\"building tender\" system present in Texas prisons in the 1970s.\n\nThis situation, of course, is radically different: building tenders\n\nwere inmates who were armed, served as official guards within the\n\nprison, and who were serving in supervisory capacities in the\n\nprison system.    See generally Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265,\n\n1294-98 (S.D. Tex. 1980).       Whereas it is quite easy to see how\n\narmed     prisoners   granted   nearly    indiscriminate   authority   to\n\nbrutalize fellow prisoners are a threat to institutional security,\n\nthe same cannot be said about a preacher who offers a weekly sermon\n\nunder the direction of the prison chaplain.\n\n            Beyond the Texas \"trustee system,\" Gadsden cites no past\n\ninstances where having inmates in leadership positions endangered\n\nsecurity, nor does he explain why a person who expounds on the\n\nscripture during a weekly religious service would be considered a\n\nleader.     Self-serving affidavits that do not \"contain adequate\n\nspecific factual information based on personal knowledge\" are\n\ninsufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment, let alone to\n\nsustain one.    Quiñones v. Houser Buick, 436 F.3d 284, 290 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); see also Hayes, 8 F.3d at 92 (\"Although an expert affidavit\n\nneed not include details about all of the raw data used to produce\n\na conclusion, or about scientific or other specialized input which\n\nmight be confusing to a lay person, it must at least include the\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\ffactual   basis    and   the    process     of   reasoning    which     makes   the\n\nconclusion    viable     in    order   to   defeat    a    motion   for    summary\n\njudgment.\").\n\n             In   addition,     RIDOC's     initial       explanation     for   the\n\npreaching ban was that only ordained ministers were allowed to\n\npreach, and that Spratt was not ordained.                 However, according to\n\nmaterials submitted in connection with Spratt's motion for summary\n\njudgment, he had been an ordained minister since 2000.8                 RIDOC now\n\nclaims that its initial explanation was \"incomplete,\" and that the\n\nreal reason is that no inmates are allowed to preach at all.                     At\n\nthe   very   least,    the     inconsistencies     between     RIDOC's     various\n\nexplanations for its policy require further explanation.9\n\n\n\n\n8\n   Spratt claims that in fact, the ban on preaching was enacted in\nretribution for a dispute that he had with a guard. If this were\ntrue, it would undercut the state's argument that the blanket ban\non preaching is essential to prison security.\n9\n   RIDOC offers a third explanation for its prohibition on inmate\npreaching.   RIDOC suggests that inmate-led religious activities\ncould foment terrorism-related activity. See Appellee's Br. at 18\nn.8 (citing Frank Cilluffo et al., Geo. Wash. Univ. Homeland Sec.\nPolicy Inst. and Univ. of Va. Critical Incident Analysis Group, Out\nof the Shadows: Getting Ahead of Prisoner Radicalization (2006),\navailable at http://www.gwumc.edu/hspi/reports/rad/Out%20of%20the%\n20shadows.pdf). The report cited by RIDOC describes the formation\nof terror cells in prisons by radicalized Muslim inmates. This\nexplanation for the blanket ban on inmate preaching further\ndemonstrates that RIDOC has not engaged in any individualized\nconsideration of Spratt's preaching whatsoever. Cf. Gonzales v. O\nCentro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 126 S.\nCt. 1211, 1221 (2006) (requiring that the government engage in\nindividualized consideration of the necessity of a burden on\nreligious exercise).\n\n                                       -14-\n\f           Finally, RIDOC claims that it was merely \"lucky\" that\n\ninstitutional security was not threatened during Spratt's seven\n\nyear stint as a preacher, and that it need not wait for a dangerous\n\nsituation to occur before it takes steps to remedy the threat.      See\n\nCasey v. Lewis, 4 F.3d 1516, 1521 (9th Cir. 1993) (noting that\n\n\"failure to specify a past event\" that threatened institutional\n\nsecurity   \"does   not    render     irrational   the   adoption    and\n\nimplementation of a . . . policy\" to address future events that\n\nmight pose a threat).    RIDOC also claims that its policy is long-\n\nstanding, and that prison officials who permitted Spratt to preach\n\nwere in violation of it. However, Spratt's seven-year track record\n\nas a preacher, which is apparently unblemished by any hint of\n\nunsavory activity, at the very least casts doubt on the strength of\n\nthe link between his activities and institutional security.        While\n\nwe recognize that prison officials are to be accorded substantial\n\ndeference in the way they run their prisons, this does not mean\n\nthat we will \"rubber stamp or mechanically accept the judgments of\n\nprison administrators.\"   Lovelace, 472 F.3d at 190.10\n\n           Even if we assume that RIDOC has shown a link between\n\nSpratt's preaching and institutional security, RIDOC still has not\n\n\n10\n   In Lovelace, the Fourth Circuit suggested that its result would\nhave been different if \"assumptions about the governmental\ninterests involved here had been included in an affidavit by the\nwarden or some other [prison] official.\" 472 F.3d at 191. We do\nnot think that an affidavit that contains only conclusory\nstatements about the need to protect inmate security is sufficient\nto meet RIDOC's burden under RLIUPA.\n\n                                   -15-\n\fshown that the blanket ban on all inmate preaching is the \"least\n\nrestrictive means\" available to achieve its interest.                  A prison\n\n\"cannot meet its burden to prove least restrictive means unless it\n\ndemonstrates that it has actually considered and rejected the\n\nefficacy   of   less      restrictive    measures    before   adopting        the\n\nchallenged practice.\"       Warsoldier v. Woodford, 418 F.3d 989, 999\n\n(9th Cir. 2005); Murphy, 372 F.3d at 989 (\"It is not clear that\n\nMDOC seriously considered any other alternatives, nor were any\n\nexplored   before   the    district     court.\");   cf.   Casey   v.   City   of\n\nNewport, 308 F.3d 106, 114 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[T]he narrow-tailoring\n\ntest requires the district court to consider whether the regulation\n\nchallenged on First Amendment grounds sweeps more broadly than\n\nnecessary to promote the government's interest. That consideration,\n\nin turn, cannot be done without some evaluation of the alternative\n\nmeasures put in issue by the parties.\").11          Rather than considering\n\nalternatives, RIDOC argues that inmate preaching is an \"all or\n\nnothing\" issue: any amount of inmate preaching, it contends, is\n\ndangerous to institutional security under any circumstances.                   As\n\n\n\n11\n    It is important to note that we do not construe RLUIPA to\n\"require prison administrators to refute every conceivable option\nin order to satisfy the least restrictive means prong of RFRA.\"\nHamilton v. Schriro, 74 F.3d 1545, 1556 (8th Cir. 1996). However,\nto meet the least restrictive means test, prison administrators\ngenerally ought to explore at least some alternatives, and their\nrejection should generally be accompanied by some measure of\nexplanation. A blanket statement that all alternatives have been\nconsidered and rejected, such as the one here, will ordinarily be\ninsufficient.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fsuch, RIDOC argues, there are no \"less restrictive alternatives.\"\n\nHowever, it is not clear how RIDOC has come to this conclusion.\n\nSee Warsoldier, 418 F.3d at 999 (explaining that a California\n\nprison had done \"nothing to . . . discuss whether it has ever\n\nconsidered a less restrictive approach\" to a blanket ban on long\n\nhair).   RIDOC offers no explanation for why alternative policies\n\nwould be unfeasible, or why they would be less effective in\n\nmaintaining institutional security.\n\n          RIDOC   responds   by   pointing   to   the   Eighth   Circuit's\n\ndecision in Hamilton v. Schriro, 74 F.3d 1545 (8th Cir. 1996), in\n\nwhich that court accepted prison administrators' contention that a\n\nregulation requiring inmates to have short hair was the least\n\nrestrictive means of achieving prison security. However, the court\n\nin Hamilton made this determination after considering lengthy\n\ntestimony by the prison administrators in the district court,\n\nsomething which is notably absent here.      Id. at 1555.   In addition,\n\nthe Eighth Circuit relied on several district court decisions\n\nupholding hair length regulations against RFRA challenges, at least\n\none of which appears to have considered and rejected alternatives\n\nto the regulation.   Id. at 1555 n.12.   In contrast, RIDOC offers no\n\ncase finding that blanket bans on inmate preaching satisfy the\n\nleast restrictive means test, and none appear to exist.12         Finally,\n\n\n12\n    Past decisions have found that restricting inmate preaching\n\"reasonably\" furthered institutional security. See, e.g., Anderson\nv. Angelone, 123 F.3d 1197, 1199 (9th Cir. 1997) (\"Requiring an\n\n                                  -17-\n\fthe Eighth Circuit explicitly acknowledged that \"prison authorities\n\nmust   do    more    than      offer   conclusory    statements      and    post    hoc\n\nrationalizations for their conduct.\"                 Id. at 1554 n.10.            Thus,\n\nHamilton lends little support to RIDOC's argument here.\n\n             In fact, RIDOC's \"all or nothing\" argument raises many\n\nquestions.     Why are inmates banned from preaching when they are\n\nfree to become leaders under other circumstances? Likewise, why is\n\nSpratt still allowed to stand in front of his congregation and read\n\nscripture     if     it   is    his    appearance     in   the     pulpit    that   is\n\nproblematic?        If it is the \"teaching\" element of scripture that is\n\nso troubling, why are inmates permitted to assist instructors in\n\neducational programs at the prison?                Why would allowing preaching\n\nonly under strict prison supervision be a less effective solution\n\nto   the    purported     \"threat      to    institutional   security\"?           These\n\nquestions,     all    unanswered,       suggest     that   RIDOC    has     not   given\n\nconsideration to possible alternatives.13\n\n\noutside minister to lead religious activity among inmates\nundoubtedly contributes to prison security.\"); Hadi v. Horn, 830\nF.2d 779, 785 n.9 (7th Cir. 1987).      However, these cases were\ndecided under the pre-RLUIPA standard of Turner v. Safley, which\nstates that a \"[prison] regulation is valid if it is reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests.\"      482 U.S. 78, 89\n(1987).    The RLUIPA standard, which requires that prison\nadministrators achieve a \"compelling interest\" by the \"least\nrestrictive means,\" imposes a different burden on prison officials.\nSee Lovelace, 472 F.3d at 199-200 (\"[T]he First Amendment affords\nless protection to inmates' free exercise rights than does\nRLUIPA.\").\n13\n   This list of questions is offered by way of example, and is not\nexhaustive. We leave it to the district court to determine whether\n\n                                            -18-\n\f          Furthermore, \"[e]qually problematic . . . is that other\n\nprison systems, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, do not\n\nhave such . . . policies or, if they do, [they] provide . . .\n\nexemptions.\"   Warsoldier, 418 F.3d at 999.    As Spratt points out,\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons policy on religious practices appears\n\nto   contemplate     inmate-led   religious   services   in    certain\n\ncircumstances.     See Federal Bureau of Prisons, Program Statement:\n\nReligious Beliefs and Practices, Statement P5360.09 (2004) ¶ 7(d)\n\n(\"Inmate-led     religious    programs   require    constant     staff\n\nsupervision.\"); id. ¶ 7(a) (\"Inmates may recite formulaic prayers\n\nin the language required by their religion.        Sermons, original\n\noratory, teachings and admonitions must be delivered in English.\").\n\nWe recognize that \"prison officials . . . are infinitely more\n\nfamiliar with their own institutions than outside observers,\"\n\nHamilton, 74 F.3d at 1556 n.15, and that as such, evidence of\n\npolicies at one prison is not conclusive proof that the same\n\npolicies would work at another institution.         However, in the\n\nabsence of any explanation by RIDOC of significant differences\n\nbetween the ACI and a federal prison that would render the federal\n\npolicy unworkable, the Federal Bureau of Prisons policy suggests\n\nthat some form of inmate preaching could be permissible without\n\ndisturbing prison security.\n\n\n\nRIDOC has adequately shown that its policy is the least restrictive\nmeans of achieving prison security.\n\n                                  -19-\n\f           Simply put, RIDOC must \"demonstrate, and not just assert,\n\nthat the rule at issue is the least restrictive means of achieving\n\na compelling governmental interest.\" O'Bryan v. Bureau of Prisons,\n\n349 F.3d 399, 401 (7th Cir. 2003).      This does not conflict with our\n\npolicy of deferring to the judgment of prison administrators.\n\nRather, before we can evaluate whether deference is due, we require\n\nthat prison administrators explain in some detail what their\n\njudgment is.14    Here, RIDOC \"offer[s] conclusory statements that a\n\nlimitation on religious freedom is required for security, health or\n\nsafety.\"   Weaver v. Jago, 675 F.2d 116, 119 (6th Cir. 1982).       To\n\nprevail on summary judgment, RIDOC must do more.\n\n           C. Remedy\n\n           Spratt asks that we enter summary judgment in his favor.\n\nAlternatively, Spratt asks that we reverse summary judgment and\n\nremand the matter for discovery and trial on the merits.       Summary\n\njudgment is proper only when \"there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   Denial of summary judgment\n\nis also appropriate where factual records are \"disturbingly thin,\"\n\n\n\n14\n   The level of deference to be accorded to prison administrators\nunder RLUIPA remains an open question.         RLUIPA's statutory\nrequirement that we apply strict scrutiny to prison policies that\nsubstantially burden religious exercise may be in tension with the\nlegislative history which suggests that courts should continue to\ndefer to the expertise of prison administrators. Obviously, courts\nwill need to find some balance between scrutiny of and deference to\nprison regulations. We need not resolve that question now because\nRIDOC has yet to present any reasoned judgment to justify the\npolicies at issue in this case.\n\n                                 -20-\n\f\"contain gaps,\" and require judgment calls which depend on evidence\n\nnot in the record but readily obtainable.         See Mandel v. The Boston\n\nPhoenix,      Inc.,    456    F.3d     198,   205-07    (1st   Cir.    2006).\n\nNotwithstanding Spratt's protestations to the contrary, it is clear\n\nthat there are factual disputes, including whether a ban on inmate\n\npreaching furthers prison security, and whether a blanket ban is\n\nthe least restrictive means necessary. The factual record on these\n\nissues is quite thin.         As such, it would also be improvident at\n\nthis point to grant summary judgment in favor of Spratt.              We have\n\nheld   that    entry   of    summary   judgment   for   defendant     was   not\n\nwarranted.     Each side, on remand, may present further evidence and\n\nargument.\n\n                               III. Conclusion\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court and remand for further disposition in accordance\n\nherewith.\n\n              Reversed and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\f",

After prison officials prohibited Spratt from preaching to his fellow inmates, he filed suit against the Rhode Island Department of Corrections and its director, A.T. Wall (collectively, \"RIDOC\") under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000cc <i>et seq.</i> (\"RLUIPA\"). The district court granted summary judgment to RIDOC. After careful consideration, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spratt is a prisoner in the maximum security unit and is serving a life sentence for murder. <i>See State v. Spratt,</i> 742 A.2d 1194 (R.I.1999). In 1995, Spratt underwent a religious awakening, and began attending Christian services at the ACI. Impressed with his commitment and devotion, the prison chaplains began allowing Spratt to preach<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to inmates during weekly services. In 2000, Spratt was ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church. From 1995 until 2003, no prison official interfered with Spratt's religious activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Spratt's preaching during this seven year period did not lead to any apparent disciplinary problems at the ACI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2003, then-Warden Whitman was replaced by Warden Weeden, who remains the warden of the ACI. On October 15, 2003, Spratt was told by a correctional officer that he was no longer allowed to preach in the chapel. When Spratt approached Warden Weeden about the matter, he was told that preaching by prisoners was not allowed under prison regulations. Spratt formalized his complaint in writing, and Warden Weeden responded that inmate preaching was prohibited by RIDOC Policy # 26.01-2DOC, which states that all religious services are scheduled, supervised, and directed by institutional chaplains.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Weeden also informed Spratt that if he was found to be preaching, he would be subject to disciplinary action. Spratt then filed a complaint with A.T. Wall, director of RIDOC, stating the aforementioned facts, and asking that Wall allow him to preach. Wall responded in a letter dated December 15, 2003, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Spratt, you do have the right to practice your religion under the constitution subject to reasonable restrictions. Because you are not an acknowledged member of the clergy, you do not have the right to proselytize or preach to the inmate population. Therefore, your request for my intervention is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spratt proceeded to file a pro se complaint against Wall and RIDOC in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, asking for relief under the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000bb-1(C) (\"RFRA\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Spratt's complaint stated that the prison policy prohibiting inmate preaching did not satisfy the \"least restrictive means\" test in RFRA, and asked for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages of $40.29 (the cost of legal paper and copies). RIDOC filed an answer stating that they lacked sufficient information to admit or deny Spratt's allegations, but asserted various affirmative defenses. Spratt moved for summary judgment, attaching various letters from prison clergy attesting to his skill as a preacher, his minister's certificate, and the aforementioned correspondence between himself and prison officials. RIDOC responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment, asking that the claims against Wall in his individual capacity be dismissed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and arguing that RIDOC had satisfied the requirements of RLUIPA because (a) Spratt's religious exercise was not substantially burdened and (b) even if it was burdened, RIDOC had a compelling state interest which was accomplished by the least restrictive means. RIDOC attached to their motion for summary judgment a \"statement of undisputed facts,\" which acknowledged that \"no material facts are in dispute in this matter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was referred to a magistrate judge, who filed a report and recommendation granting RIDOC summary judgment on Spratt's First and Fourteenth Amendment claims,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and staying the RLUIPA claim pending the Supreme Court's resolution of <i>Cutter v. Wilkinson,</i> 544 U.S. 709, 722-24, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005), which considered various constitutional challenges to RLUIPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After <i>Cutter</i> rejected the constitutional challenges to RLUIPA, the magistrate judge ordered the parties to submit additional briefing as to whether RLUIPA was applicable to RIDOC, and as to the merits of Spratt's RLUIPA claim. RIDOC submitted a supplemental memorandum acknowledging that it was subject to RLUIPA because it accepted federal funding, and attached an affidavit from Jake Gadsden, Assistant Director of Operations for the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. The affidavit briefly reviews Gadsden's professional experience, and states that inmates may not lead religious services in RIDOC facilities. Gadsden explains in the affidavit that inmate preaching could be dangerous because \"placing an inmate in a position of actual or perceived leadership before an inmate group threatens security, as it provides the perceived inmate leader with influence within the administration.\" Gadsden further states in the affidavit that \"there is no less restrictive manner to accommodate Spratt's desire to preach to an inmate congregation, other than an outright ban,\" because even an inmate preaching under RIDOC supervision would be perceived as having influence. Finally, the affidavit states that Gadsden was familiar with a program in the Texas Correctional System which he identified as the \"trustee\" program, in which inmates were given certain leadership roles. Gadsden states that Texas abolished the program because the inmate leaders abused their positions to garner favors from fellow inmates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spratt filed an affidavit in response, which states that he acknowledges Gadsden's \"noteworthy\" credentials, but that Gadsden's conclusions are \"exaggerat[ion] and speculation.\" Spratt also stated in a memorandum of law that he would willingly submit to further RIDOC supervision of his preaching activities. He also suggested that RIDOC could retain their policy against inmate preaching but grant limited exemptions when enforcement of the policy would result in a violation of RLUIPA. Spratt noted that RIDOC allows inmates to congregate and talk freely about non-religious topics during recreational time, and that this had not been found to pose a threat to prison security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation granting RIDOC summary judgment on Spratt's RLUIPA claim. The report found that Spratt had satisfied the first two elements of the RLUIPA test: that preaching was part of Spratt's religious exercise and that the religious exercise had been substantially burdened by the RIDOC prohibition. However, the magistrate judge concluded that RIDOC had established that inmate security was a compelling state interest, and that the total ban on inmate preaching was the least restrictive means by which to accomplish that goal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spratt objected to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, and the issue was referred to a district judge. The court held a hearing on the objection on April 6, 2006. At the hearing on Spratt's objection, Spratt was represented by counsel from the ACLU of Rhode Island. During the hearing, the court initially seemed skeptical of RIDOC's claim that the Gadsden affidavit was sufficient to overcome summary judgment, stating, \"What evidence do I have? See, that's the problem here. What evidence is in the record that says it's got to be a total ban. There's just no other solution. I'm looking at this very high burden and very little evidence.\" Nevertheless, the court adopted and affirmed the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, noting that \"while the issue is somewhat of a close call, the Magistrate Judge's [report and recommendation] on balance represents both a fair and reasonable interpretation of the RLUIPA claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a grant of summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> viewing the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no material disputes of fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. RLUIPA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RLUIPA was enacted in 2000 as a response to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>City of Boerne v. Flores,</i> which partially struck down the previously enacted Religious Freedom Restoration Act on the grounds that it exceeded Congress' power to regulate the states under the Fourteenth Amendment. 521 U.S. 507, 529-36, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997) (holding that RFRA may not be applied to purely state, as opposed to federal, action). Whereas RFRA had applied to all action by \"Government,\" RLUIPA is substantially narrower in scope, and the portion of that statute at issue in this case applies only to \"a program or activity [in an institution] that receives Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000cc-1(b)(1). Substantively, RLUIPA provides that No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, as defined in [42 U.S.C. &#167; 1997], even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 2000cc-1(a). Thus, a claim under RLUIPA includes four elements. On the first two elements, (1) that an institutionalized person's religious exercise has been burdened and (2) that the burden is substantial, the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2000cc-2(b). Once a plaintiff has established that his religious exercise has been substantially burdened, the onus shifts to the government to show (3) that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest and (4) that the burden is the least restrictive means of achieving that compelling interest. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Spratt's Burden</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this appeal, the state does not seriously dispute that Spratt's evidence on his prima facie case is sufficient to survive summary judgment. As an inmate in a state correctional facility, Spratt is an institutionalized person within the definition of RLUIPA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1997(1) (\"The term `institution' means any facility or institution&#8212;(A) which is owned, operated, or managed by, or provides services on behalf of any State or political subdivision of a State; and (B) which is-(ii) a jail, prison, or other correctional facility . . . .\"). Furthermore, it is clear that preaching is a form of religious exercise. <i>See McDaniel v. Paty,</i> 435 U.S. 618, 626, 98 S.Ct. 1322, 55 L.Ed.2d 593 (1978) (\"[T]he right to the free exercise of religion unquestionably encompasses the right to preach, proselyte, and perform other similar religious functions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second prong, RIDOC devotes a footnote in its brief to suggesting that Spratt's \"exercise of . . . religion in general is not being substantially burdened.\" Appellees' Br. at 11 n. 6. RIDOC points out that \"Spratt may still attend and participate in religious services. He may pray, sing, or recite during such services just as every other inmate may.\" <i>Id.</i> We have not yet had the opportunity to define what constitutes a \"substantial burden\" under RLUIPA. The district court decided that a \"substantial burden\" is one that \"put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs,\" citing <i>Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana Employment Security Division,</i> 450 U.S. 707, 718, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981); <i>see also Lovelace v. Lee,</i> 472 F.3d 174, 187 (4th Cir.2006) (applying the <i>Thomas</i> standard in a RLUIPA case). Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that <i>Thomas</i> applies, RIDOC has not on this appeal seriously contested the issue and Spratt has stated that RIDOC will not allow him to preach anytime or anywhere, threatening that if he does so, he will be subject to disciplinary sanctions. As such, for the purposes of this appeal, Spratt has made a prima facie showing that his religious exercise has been substantially burdened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. RIDOC's Burden</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden thus shifts to RIDOC to demonstrate that its ban on inmate preaching, as applied to Spratt, furthers a \"compelling governmental interest\" and is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000cc-1. We are mindful, however, that in passing RLUIPA, Congress stated that we should continue to give \"due deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators\" in determining prison policy. <i>Cutter,</i> 544 U.S. at 717, 125 S.Ct. 2113 (internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting 146 Cong. Rec. S7774, S7775 (daily ed. July 27, 2000) (joint statement of Sens. Hatch and Kennedy on RLUIPA)). However, as the Congressional sponsors of RLUIPA stated, \"inadequately formulated prison regulations and policies grounded on mere speculation, exaggerated fears, or post-hoc rationalizations will not suffice to meet the act's requirements.\" 146 Cong. Rec. at S7775 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIDOC asserts that it has a compelling state interest in maintaining prison security. We agree. <i>See, e.g., Cutter,</i> 544 U.S. at 725 n. 13, 125 S.Ct. 2113 (\"It bears repetition . . . that prison security is a compelling state interest, and that deference is due to institutional officials' expertise in this area.\"). However, merely stating a compelling interest does not fully satisfy RIDOC's burden on this element of RLUIPA; RIDOC must also establish that prison security is furthered by barring Wesley Spratt from engaging in any preaching at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIDOC has offered just one piece of evidence to support this assertion: the Gadsden affidavit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> This affidavit, which cites no studies and discusses no research in support of its position, simply describes the equation thus: if Spratt is a preacher, he is a leader; having leaders in prison (even those sanctioned by the administration) is detrimental to prison security; thus, Spratt's preaching activity is detrimental to prison security. But to prevail on summary judgment, RIDOC \"must do more than merely assert a security concern.\" <i>Murphy v. Mo. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 372 F.3d 979, 988 (8th Cir.2004). The Gadsden affidavit offers only one reference to another prison in support of its assertion that inmate preaching is a security concern: the affidavit mentions a situation in Texas which was described as a \"trustee\" system. We believe that Gadsden was referring to the \"building tender\" system present in Texas prisons in the 1970s. This situation, of course, is radically different: building tenders were inmates who were armed, served as official guards within the prison, and who were serving in supervisory capacities in the prison system. <i>See generally Ruiz v. Estelle,</i> 503 F.Supp. 1265, 1294-98 (S.D.Tex.1980). Whereas it is quite easy to see how armed prisoners granted nearly indiscriminate authority to brutalize fellow prisoners are a threat to institutional security, the same cannot be said about a preacher who offers a weekly sermon under the direction of the prison chaplain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the Texas \"trustee system,\" Gadsden cites no past instances where having inmates in leadership positions endangered security, nor does he explain why a person who expounds on the scripture during a weekly religious service would be considered a leader. Self-serving affidavits that do not \"contain adequate specific factual information based on personal knowledge\" are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment, let alone to sustain one. <i>Qui&#241;ones v. Houser Buick,</i> 436 F.3d 284, 290 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also Hayes,</i> 8 F.3d at 92 (\"Although an expert affidavit need not include details about all of the raw data used to produce a conclusion, or about scientific or other specialized input which might be confusing to a lay person, it must at least include the factual basis and the process of reasoning which makes the conclusion viable in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, RIDOC's initial explanation for the preaching ban was that only ordained ministers were allowed to preach, and that Spratt was not ordained. However, according to materials submitted in connection with Spratt's motion for summary judgment, he had been an ordained minister since 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> RIDOC now claims that its initial explanation was \"incomplete,\" and that the real reason is that no inmates are allowed to preach at all. At the very least, the inconsistencies between RIDOC's various explanations for its policy require further explanation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, RIDOC claims that it was merely \"lucky\" that institutional security was not threatened during Spratt's seven year stint as a preacher, and that it need not wait for a dangerous situation to occur before it takes steps to remedy the threat. <i>See Casey v. Lewis,</i> 4 F.3d 1516, 1521 (9th Cir.1993) (noting that \"failure to specify a past event\" that threatened institutional security \"does not render irrational the adoption and implementation of a . . . policy\" to address future events that might pose a threat). RIDOC also claims that its policy is long-standing, and that prison officials who permitted Spratt to preach were in violation of it. However, Spratt's seven-year track record as a preacher, which is apparently unblemished by any hint of unsavory activity, at the very least casts doubt on the strength of the link between his activities and institutional security. While we recognize that prison officials are to be accorded substantial deference in the way they run their prisons, this does not mean that we will \"rubber stamp or mechanically accept the judgments of prison administrators.\" <i>Lovelace,</i> 472 F.3d at 190.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that RIDOC has shown a link between Spratt's preaching and institutional security, RIDOC still has not shown that the blanket ban on all inmate preaching is the \"least restrictive means\" available to achieve its interest. A prison \"cannot meet its burden to prove least restrictive means unless it demonstrates that it has actually considered and rejected the efficacy of less restrictive measures before adopting the challenged practice.\" <i>Warsoldier v. Woodford,</i> 418 F.3d 989, 999 (9th Cir.2005); <i>Murphy,</i> 372 F.3d at 989 (\"It is not clear that MDOC seriously considered any other alternatives, nor were any explored before the district court.\"); <i>cf. Casey v. City of Newport,</i> 308 F.3d 106, 114 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[T]he narrow-tailoring test requires the district court to consider whether the regulation challenged on First Amendment grounds sweeps more broadly than necessary to promote the government's interest. That consideration, in turn, cannot be done without some evaluation of the alternative measures put in issue by the parties.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Rather than considering alternatives, RIDOC argues that inmate preaching is an \"all or nothing\" issue: any amount of inmate preaching, it contends, is dangerous to institutional security under any circumstances. As such, RIDOC argues, there are no \"less restrictive alternatives.\" However, it is not clear how RIDOC has come to this conclusion. <i>See Warsoldier,</i> 418 F.3d at 999 (explaining that a California prison had done \"nothing to . . . discuss whether it has ever considered a less restrictive approach\" to a blanket ban on long hair). RIDOC offers no explanation for why alternative policies would be unfeasible, or why they would be less effective in maintaining institutional security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIDOC responds by pointing to the Eighth Circuit's decision in <i>Hamilton v. Schriro,</i> 74 F.3d 1545 (8th Cir.1996), in which that court accepted prison administrators' contention that a regulation requiring inmates to have short hair was the least restrictive means of achieving prison security. However, the court in <i>Hamilton</i> made this determination after considering lengthy testimony by the prison administrators in the district court, something which is notably absent here. <i>Id.</i> at 1555. In addition, the Eighth Circuit relied on several district court decisions upholding hair length regulations against RFRA challenges, at least one of which appears to have considered and rejected alternatives to the regulation. <i>Id.</i> at 1555 n. 12. In contrast, RIDOC offers no case finding that blanket bans on inmate preaching satisfy the least restrictive means test, and none appear to exist.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Finally, the Eighth Circuit explicitly acknowledged that \"prison on authorities must do more than offer conclusory statements and post hoc rationalizations for their conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1554 n. 10. Thus, <i>Hamilton</i> lends little support to RIDOC's argument here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, RIDOC's \"all or nothing\" argument raises many questions. Why are inmates banned from preaching when they are free to become leaders under other circumstances? Likewise, why is Spratt still allowed to stand in front of his congregation and read scripture if it is his appearance in the pulpit that is problematic? If it is the \"teaching\" element of scripture that is so troubling, why are inmates permitted to assist instructors in educational programs at the prison? Why would allowing preaching only under strict prison supervision be a less effective solution to the purported \"threat to institutional security\"? These questions, all unanswered, suggest that RIDOC has not given consideration to possible alternatives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, \"[e]qually problematic . . . is that other prison systems, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, do not have such . . . policies or, if they do, [they] provide . . . exemptions.\" <i>Warsoldier,</i> 418 F.3d at 999. As Spratt points out, the Federal Bureau of Prisons policy on religious practices appears to contemplate inmate-led religious services in certain circumstances. <i>See</i> Federal Bureau of Prisons, <i>Program Statement: Religious Beliefs and Practices,</i> Statement P5360.09 (2004) &amp; 7(d) (\"Inmate-led religious programs require constant staff supervision.\"); <i>id.</i> &amp; 7(a) (\"Inmates may recite formulaic prayers in the language required by their religion. Sermons, original oratory, teachings and admonitions must be delivered in English.\"). We recognize that \"prison officials . . . are infinitely more familiar with their own institutions than outside observers,\" <i>Hamilton,</i> 74 F.3d at 1556 n. 15, and that as such, evidence of policies at one prison is not conclusive proof that the same policies would work at another institution. However, in the absence of any explanation by RIDOC of significant differences between the ACI and a federal prison that would render the federal policy unworkable, the Federal Bureau of Prisons policy suggests that some form of inmate preaching could be permissible without disturbing prison security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simply put, RIDOC must \"demonstrate, and not just assert, that the rule at issue is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling governmental interest.\" <i>O'Bryan v. Bureau of Prisons,</i> 349 F.3d 399, 401 (7th Cir.2003). This does not conflict with our policy of deferring to the judgment of prison administrators. Rather, before we can evaluate whether deference is due, we require that prison administrators explain in some detail what their judgment is.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Here, RIDOC \"offer[s] conclusory statements that a limitation on religious freedom is required for security, health or safety.\" <i>Weaver v. Jago,</i> 675 F.2d 116, 119 (6th Cir.1982). To prevail on summary judgment, RIDOC must do more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Remedy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spratt asks that we enter summary judgment in his favor. Alternatively, Spratt asks that we reverse summary judgment and remand the matter for discovery and trial on the merits. Summary judgment is proper only when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Denial of summary judgment is also appropriate where factual records are \"disturbingly thin,\" \"contain gaps,\" and require judgment calls which depend on evidence not in the record but readily obtainable. <i>See Mandel v. The Boston Phoenix, Inc.,</i> 456 F.3d 198, 205-07 (1st Cir.2006). Notwithstanding Spratt's protestations to the contrary, it is clear that there are factual disputes, including whether a ban on inmate preaching furthers prison security, and whether a blanket ban is the least restrictive means necessary. The factual record on these issues is quite thin. As such, it would also be improvident at this point to grant summary judgment in favor of Spratt. We have held that entry of summary judgment for defendant was not warranted. Each side, on remand, may present further evidence and argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further disposition in accordance herewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed and Remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To be clear, we use the word \"preach\" to refer to the activity of commenting or expounding upon some religious text.

The report cited by RIDOC describes the formation of terror cells in prisons by radicalized Muslim inmates. This explanation for the blanket ban on inmate preaching further demonstrates that RIDOC has not engaged in any individualized consideration of Spratt's preaching whatsoever. <i>Cf. Gonzales v.

After prison officials prohibited Spratt from preaching to his fellow inmates, he filed suit against the Rhode Island Department of Corrections and its director, A.T. Wall (collectively, \"RIDOC\") under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000cc <i>et seq.</i> (\"RLUIPA\").

In 1995, Spratt underwent a religious awakening, and began attending Christian services at the ACI. Impressed with his commitment and devotion, the prison chaplains began allowing Spratt to preach<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to inmates during weekly services. In 2000, Spratt was ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church. From 1995 until 2003, no prison official interfered with Spratt's religious activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Spratt's preaching during this seven year period did not lead to any apparent disciplinary problems at the ACI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2003, then-Warden Whitman was replaced by Warden Weeden, who remains the warden of the ACI. On October 15, 2003, Spratt was told by a correctional officer that he was no longer allowed to preach in the chapel. When Spratt approached Warden Weeden about the matter, he was told that preaching by prisoners was not allowed under prison regulations. Spratt formalized his complaint in writing, and Warden Weeden responded that inmate preaching was prohibited by RIDOC Policy # 26.01-2DOC, which states that all religious services are scheduled, supervised, and directed by institutional chaplains.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Weeden also informed Spratt that if he was found to be preaching, he would be subject to disciplinary action. Spratt then filed a complaint with A.T. Wall, director of RIDOC, stating the aforementioned facts, and asking that Wall allow him to preach. Wall responded in a letter dated December 15, 2003, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Spratt, you do have the right to practice your religion under the constitution subject to reasonable restrictions.

Therefore, your request for my intervention is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spratt proceeded to file a pro se complaint against Wall and RIDOC in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, asking for relief under the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000bb-1(C) (\"RFRA\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Spratt's complaint stated that the prison policy prohibiting inmate preaching did not satisfy the \"least restrictive means\" test in RFRA, and asked for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages of $40.29 (the cost of legal paper and copies). RIDOC filed an answer stating that they lacked sufficient information to admit or deny Spratt's allegations, but asserted various affirmative defenses. Spratt moved for summary judgment, attaching various letters from prison clergy attesting to his skill as a preacher, his minister's certificate, and the aforementioned correspondence between himself and prison officials. RIDOC responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment, asking that the claims against Wall in his individual capacity be dismissed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and arguing that RIDOC had satisfied the requirements of RLUIPA because (a) Spratt's religious exercise was not substantially burdened and (b) even if it was burdened, RIDOC had a compelling state interest which was accomplished by the least restrictive means. RIDOC attached to their motion for summary judgment a \"statement of undisputed facts,\" which acknowledged that \"no material facts are in dispute in this matter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was referred to a magistrate judge, who filed a report and recommendation granting RIDOC summary judgment on Spratt's First and Fourteenth Amendment claims,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and staying the RLUIPA claim pending the Supreme Court's resolution of <i>Cutter v.

RIDOC submitted a supplemental memorandum acknowledging that it was subject to RLUIPA because it accepted federal funding, and attached an affidavit from Jake Gadsden, Assistant Director of Operations for the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. The affidavit briefly reviews Gadsden's professional experience, and states that inmates may not lead religious services in RIDOC facilities. Gadsden explains in the affidavit that inmate preaching could be dangerous because \"placing an inmate in a position of actual or perceived leadership before an inmate group threatens security, as it provides the perceived inmate leader with influence within the administration.\" Gadsden further states in the affidavit that \"there is no less restrictive manner to accommodate Spratt's desire to preach to an inmate congregation, other than an outright ban,\" because even an inmate preaching under RIDOC supervision would be perceived as having influence. Finally, the affidavit states that Gadsden was familiar with a program in the Texas Correctional System which he identified as the \"trustee\" program, in which inmates were given certain leadership roles. Gadsden states that Texas abolished the program because the inmate leaders abused their positions to garner favors from fellow inmates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spratt filed an affidavit in response, which states that he acknowledges Gadsden's \"noteworthy\" credentials, but that Gadsden's conclusions are \"exaggerat[ion] and speculation.\" Spratt also stated in a memorandum of law that he would willingly submit to further RIDOC supervision of his preaching activities. He also suggested that RIDOC could retain their policy against inmate preaching but grant limited exemptions when enforcement of the policy would result in a violation of RLUIPA. Spratt noted that RIDOC allows inmates to congregate and talk freely about non-religious topics during recreational time, and that this had not been found to pose a threat to prison security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation granting RIDOC summary judgment on Spratt's RLUIPA claim. The report found that Spratt had satisfied the first two elements of the RLUIPA test: that preaching was part of Spratt's religious exercise and that the religious exercise had been substantially burdened by the RIDOC prohibition. However, the magistrate judge concluded that RIDOC had established that inmate security was a compelling state interest, and that the total ban on inmate preaching was the least restrictive means by which to accomplish that goal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spratt objected to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, and the issue was referred to a district judge. The court held a hearing on the objection on April 6, 2006. At the hearing on Spratt's objection, Spratt was represented by counsel from the ACLU of Rhode Island. During the hearing, the court initially seemed skeptical of RIDOC's claim that the Gadsden affidavit was sufficient to overcome summary judgment, stating, \"What evidence do I have? See, that's the problem here. What evidence is in the record that says it's got to be a total ban. There's just no other solution. I'm looking at this very high burden and very little evidence.\" Nevertheless, the court adopted and affirmed the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, noting that \"while the issue is somewhat of a close call, the Magistrate Judge's [report and recommendation] on balance represents both a fair and reasonable interpretation of the RLUIPA claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Whereas RFRA had applied to all action by \"Government,\" RLUIPA is substantially narrower in scope, and the portion of that statute at issue in this case applies only to \"a program or activity [in an institution] that receives Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000cc-1(b)(1). Substantively, RLUIPA provides that No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, as defined in [42 U.S.C. &#167; 1997], even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 2000cc-1(a).

On the first two elements, (1) that an institutionalized person's religious exercise has been burdened and (2) that the burden is substantial, the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2000cc-2(b). Once a plaintiff has established that his religious exercise has been substantially burdened, the onus shifts to the government to show (3) that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest and (4) that the burden is the least restrictive means of achieving that compelling interest. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

As an inmate in a state correctional facility, Spratt is an institutionalized person within the definition of RLUIPA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1997(1) (\"The term `institution' means any facility or institution&#8212;(A) which is owned, operated, or managed by, or provides services on behalf of any State or political subdivision of a State; and (B) which is-(ii) a jail, prison, or other correctional facility . . . .\"). Furthermore, it is clear that preaching is a form of religious exercise. <i>See McDaniel v. Paty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109831\"><a href=\"/opinion/109831/mcdaniel-v-paty/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 626, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109831\"><a href=\"/opinion/109831/mcdaniel-v-paty/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

RIDOC points out that \"Spratt may still attend and participate in religious services. He may pray, sing, or recite during such services just as every other inmate may.\" <i>Id.</i> We have not yet had the opportunity to define what constitutes a \"substantial burden\" under RLUIPA. The district court decided that a \"substantial burden\" is one that \"put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs,\" citing <i>Thomas v.

Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that <i>Thomas</i> applies, RIDOC has not on this appeal seriously contested the issue and Spratt has stated that RIDOC will not allow him to preach anytime or anywhere, threatening that if he does so, he will be subject to disciplinary sanctions. As such, for the purposes of this appeal, Spratt has made a prima facie showing that his religious exercise has been substantially burdened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

We are mindful, however, that in passing RLUIPA, Congress stated that we should continue to give \"due deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators\" in determining prison policy. <i>Cutter,</i> 544 U.S. at 717, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142900\"><a href=\"/opinion/142900/cutter-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hatch and Kennedy on RLUIPA)). However, as the Congressional sponsors of RLUIPA stated, \"inadequately formulated prison regulations and policies grounded on mere speculation, exaggerated fears, or post-hoc rationalizations will not suffice to meet the act's requirements.\" 146 Cong. Rec. at S7775 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIDOC asserts that it has a compelling state interest in maintaining prison security.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2113</span></a></span> (\"It bears repetition . . . that prison security is a compelling state interest, and that deference is due to institutional officials' expertise in this area.\"). However, merely stating a compelling interest does not fully satisfy RIDOC's burden on this element of RLUIPA; RIDOC must also establish that prison security is furthered by barring Wesley Spratt from engaging in any preaching at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIDOC has offered just one piece of evidence to support this assertion: the Gadsden affidavit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> This affidavit, which cites no studies and discusses no research in support of its position, simply describes the equation thus: if Spratt is a preacher, he is a leader; having leaders in prison (even those sanctioned by the administration) is detrimental to prison security; thus, Spratt's preaching activity is detrimental to prison security. But to prevail on summary judgment, RIDOC \"must do more than merely assert a security concern.\" <i>Murphy v. Mo. Dep't of Corr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786667\"><a href=\"/opinion/786667/michael-dunham-murphy-v-missouri-department-of-corrections-winfrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span>, 988 (8th Cir.2004). The Gadsden affidavit offers only one reference to another prison in support of its assertion that inmate preaching is a security concern: the affidavit mentions a situation in Texas which was described as a \"trustee\" system. We believe that Gadsden was referring to the \"building tender\" system present in Texas prisons in the 1970s. This situation, of course, is radically different: building tenders were inmates who were armed, served as official guards within the prison, and who were serving in supervisory capacities in the prison system. <i>See generally Ruiz v. Estelle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1466998\"><a href=\"/opinion/1466998/ruiz-v-estelle/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1265</span></a></span>, 1294-98 (S.D.Tex.1980). Whereas it is quite easy to see how armed prisoners granted nearly indiscriminate authority to brutalize fellow prisoners are a threat to institutional security, the same cannot be said about a preacher who offers a weekly sermon under the direction of the prison chaplain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the Texas \"trustee system,\" Gadsden cites no past instances where having inmates in leadership positions endangered security, nor does he explain why a person who expounds on the scripture during a weekly religious service would be considered a leader. Self-serving affidavits that do not \"contain adequate specific factual information based on personal knowledge\" are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment, let alone to sustain one. <i>Qui&#241;ones v. Houser Buick,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></span>, 290 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also Hayes,</i> 8 F.3d at 92 (\"Although an expert affidavit need not include details about all of the raw data used to produce a conclusion, or about scientific or other specialized input which might be confusing to a lay person, it must at least include the factual basis and the process of reasoning which makes the conclusion viable in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, RIDOC's initial explanation for the preaching ban was that only ordained ministers were allowed to preach, and that Spratt was not ordained. However, according to materials submitted in connection with Spratt's motion for summary judgment, he had been an ordained minister since 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> RIDOC now claims that its initial explanation was \"incomplete,\" and that the real reason is that no inmates are allowed to preach at all.

Lewis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652910\"><a href=\"/opinion/652910/fletcher-casey-jr-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-all-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1516</span></a></span>, 1521 (9th Cir.1993) (noting that \"failure to specify a past event\" that threatened institutional security \"does not render irrational the adoption and implementation of a . . . policy\" to address future events that might pose a threat). RIDOC also claims that its policy is long-standing, and that prison officials who permitted Spratt to preach were in violation of it. However, Spratt's seven-year track record as a preacher, which is apparently unblemished by any hint of unsavory activity, at the very least casts doubt on the strength of the link between his activities and institutional security. While we recognize that prison officials are to be accorded substantial deference in the way they run their prisons, this does not mean that we will \"rubber stamp or mechanically accept the judgments of prison administrators.\" <i>Lovelace,</i> 472 F.3d at 190.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that RIDOC has shown a link between Spratt's preaching and institutional security, RIDOC still has not shown that the blanket ban on all inmate preaching is the \"least restrictive means\" available to achieve its interest. A prison \"cannot meet its burden to prove least restrictive means unless it demonstrates that it has actually considered and rejected the efficacy of less restrictive measures before adopting the challenged practice.\" <i>Warsoldier v.

That consideration, in turn, cannot be done without some evaluation of the alternative measures put in issue by the parties.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Rather than considering alternatives, RIDOC argues that inmate preaching is an \"all or nothing\" issue: any amount of inmate preaching, it contends, is dangerous to institutional security under any circumstances. As such, RIDOC argues, there are no \"less restrictive alternatives.\" However, it is not clear how RIDOC has come to this conclusion. <i>See Warsoldier,</i> 418 F.3d at 999 (explaining that a California prison had done \"nothing to . . . discuss whether it has ever considered a less restrictive approach\" to a blanket ban on long hair). RIDOC offers no explanation for why alternative policies would be unfeasible, or why they would be less effective in maintaining institutional security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIDOC responds by pointing to the Eighth Circuit's decision in <i>Hamilton v. Schriro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712076\"><a href=\"/opinion/712076/mark-juan-hamilton-united-states-of-america-intervenor-v-dora-schriro/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1545</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1996), in which that court accepted prison administrators' contention that a regulation requiring inmates to have short hair was the least restrictive means of achieving prison security. However, the court in <i>Hamilton</i> made this determination after considering lengthy testimony by the prison administrators in the district court, something which is notably absent here. <i>Id.</i> at 1555. In addition, the Eighth Circuit relied on several district court decisions upholding hair length regulations against RFRA challenges, at least one of which appears to have considered and rejected alternatives to the regulation. <i>Id.</i> at 1555 n. 12. In contrast, RIDOC offers no case finding that blanket bans on inmate preaching satisfy the least restrictive means test, and none appear to exist.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Finally, the Eighth Circuit explicitly acknowledged that \"prison on authorities must do more than offer conclusory statements and post hoc rationalizations for their conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1554 n. 10. Thus, <i>Hamilton</i> lends little support to RIDOC's argument here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, RIDOC's \"all or nothing\" argument raises many questions. Why are inmates banned from preaching when they are free to become leaders under other circumstances? Likewise, why is Spratt still allowed to stand in front of his congregation and read scripture if it is his appearance in the pulpit that is problematic? If it is the \"teaching\" element of scripture that is so troubling, why are inmates permitted to assist instructors in educational programs at the prison? Why would allowing preaching only under strict prison supervision be a less effective solution to the purported \"threat to institutional security\"? These questions, all unanswered, suggest that RIDOC has not given consideration to possible alternatives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, \"[e]qually problematic . . . is that other prison systems, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, do not have such . . . policies or, if they do, [they] provide . . . exemptions.\" <i>Warsoldier,</i> 418 F.3d at 999. As Spratt points out, the Federal Bureau of Prisons policy on religious practices appears to contemplate inmate-led religious services in certain circumstances. <i>See</i> Federal Bureau of Prisons, <i>Program Statement: Religious Beliefs and Practices,</i> Statement P5360.09 (2004) &amp; 7(d) (\"Inmate-led religious programs require constant staff supervision.\"); <i>id.</i> &amp; 7(a) (\"Inmates may recite formulaic prayers in the language required by their religion. Sermons, original oratory, teachings and admonitions must be delivered in English.\"). We recognize that \"prison officials . . . are infinitely more familiar with their own institutions than outside observers,\" <i>Hamilton,</i> 74 F.3d at 1556 n. 15, and that as such, evidence of policies at one prison is not conclusive proof that the same policies would work at another institution. However, in the absence of any explanation by RIDOC of significant differences between the ACI and a federal prison that would render the federal policy unworkable, the Federal Bureau of Prisons policy suggests that some form of inmate preaching could be permissible without disturbing prison security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simply put, RIDOC must \"demonstrate, and not just assert, that the rule at issue is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling governmental interest.\" <i>O'Bryan v.

This does not conflict with our policy of deferring to the judgment of prison administrators. Rather, before we can evaluate whether deference is due, we require that prison administrators explain in some detail what their judgment is.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Here, RIDOC \"offer[s] conclusory statements that a limitation on religious freedom is required for security, health or safety.\" <i>Weaver v.

Remedy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spratt asks that we enter summary judgment in his favor. Alternatively, Spratt asks that we reverse summary judgment and remand the matter for discovery and trial on the merits. Summary judgment is proper only when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Denial of summary judgment is also appropriate where factual records are \"disturbingly thin,\" \"contain gaps,\" and require judgment calls which depend on evidence not in the record but readily obtainable. <i>See Mandel v. The Boston Phoenix, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202334\"><a href=\"/opinion/202334/mandel-v-boston-phoenix-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span>, 205-07 (1st Cir.2006). Notwithstanding Spratt's protestations to the contrary, it is clear that there are factual disputes, including whether a ban on inmate preaching furthers prison security, and whether a blanket ban is the least restrictive means necessary. The factual record on these issues is quite thin. As such, it would also be improvident at this point to grant summary judgment in favor of Spratt. We have held that entry of summary judgment for defendant was not warranted.

The report cited by RIDOC describes the formation of terror cells in prisons by radicalized Muslim inmates.
