At trial, appellant claimed\n                                  \n\nthat  appellee  ended  his   employment  improperly.    The  jury\n\ndetermined  that  appellant was  terminated  for  just cause  and\n\ntherefore   found  no  violation   of  his  employment  contract.\n\nAppellant now claims  that the  district court gave  the jury  an\n\nerroneous  instruction as  to \"just  cause\" and  wrongly excluded\n\nadmissible relevant evidence at trial.   Appellant thus asks this\n\ncourt to  vacate the judgment  and order  a retrial.   Because we\n\nfind no error in the district court's instructions or evidentiary\n\nrulings, we do not grant appellant his requests.\n\n                            THE FACTS\n                                     \n\n          Appellant is a structural engineer with an expertise in\n\npre-cast concrete  construction.   He worked  as a consultant  on\n\nmatters  involving  pre-cast  concrete  at  appellee's  Stamford,\n\nConnecticut headquarters.  Appellee soon determined that it would\n\nbe more profitable  to make pre-cast  products instead of  buying\n\nthem from  outside vendors.    The company thus set  up a factory\n\nfor this purpose in Pittsfield, Massachusetts and hired appellant\n\nto manage it.\n\n          The  details of  the employment  contract are  in sharp\n\ndispute.    Appellant  contends  that  he  agreed  to manage  the\n\nPittsfield facility for a minimum of three years, in exchange for\n\nsalary and benefits including housing in Pittsfield for the three\n\nyear  term.  Appellee, on the other hand, contends that appellant\n\nwas  an  at-will employee,  as were  all  other employees  of the\n\ncompany.  In  any event,  appellant began work  in Pittsfield  in\n\n                               -2-\n\nAugust, 1987.\n\n          In October 1987, the  company's senior managers visited\n\nthe plant,  announced its  immediate closure, and  terminated all\n\nemployees,  including appellant.   Appellant claims that appellee\n\nclosed  the plant to  thwart union activity.   Appellee, however,\n\ncontends that it  decided to  close the plant  because the  sharp\n\ndownturn  in  the  Northeast  real  estate  market  affected  its\n\nconstruction projects.   Appellee  also claimed  that appellant's\n\nperformance was inadequate.\n\n          Appellant  sued,  claiming that  appellee was  bound by\n\ncontract  to employ him for three years.  Appellee responded that\n\nno  contract  was  formed, but  that  even  if  one existed,  the\n\ntermination  was  for \"just  cause\"  and  therefore proper  under\n\nMassachusetts  law.   During  the trial,  appellant attempted  to\n\ncross-examine a  former supervisor about testimony  at a National\n\nLabor Relations Board hearing to the effect that there was plenty\n\nof work  at the plant.   The hearing occurred  shortly before the\n\nplant's  closing.    The  district court  judge  disallowed  this\n\nquestioning, finding  it beyond the scope  of direct examination,\n\nand more prejudicial than probative.\n\n          At the close of evidence, the district court instructed\n\nthe jury that if a contract existed, termination for \"just cause\"\n\nwould be proper.   The district court judge defined  \"just cause\"\n\nas 1) poor performance by appellant on the job or 2) a good faith\n\ndetermination that  the economic  needs of the  business required\n\nappellant's discharge.  During  deliberations, the jury asked the\n\n                               -3-\n\njudge to repeat its definition of \"just cause.\"  The jury finally\n\nfound that  a contract for fixed-term  employment existed between\n\nthe  parties, but  that  \"just cause\"  allowed  appellee to  fire\n\nappellant.    This appeal  followed  in which  appellant  seeks a\n\nretrial on only the breach of contract claims.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Appellant  urges two  errors in  the  jury instruction.\n\nFirst,  he contends that the instruction does not reflect the law\n\nin Massachusetts as to the definition of just cause.   Second, he\n\nclaims that  the instruction  improperly invaded the  province of\n\nthe  jury,  by  settling a  question  of  fact,  in violation  of\n\nMassachusetts law.  As appellant claims that the jury instruction\n\nincorrectly stated  Massachusetts contract  law, we review  it de\n                                                                 \n\nnovo.   Salve Regina  College v. Russell, 111  S. Ct. 1217 (1991)\n                                        \n\n(mandating  de novo  review  of  a  district  court's  state  law\n                   \n\ndeterminations).\n\n          The suspect instruction reads as follows:\n\n            An employer  has just cause  to discharge\n            an  employee   if,   one,  there   is   a\n            reasonable     basis     for     employer\n            dissatisfaction  with  an  employee,  for\n            reasons  such  as  lack  of  capacity  or\n            diligence,  failure  to conform  to usual\n            standards of conduct,  or other  culpable\n            or  inappropriate behavior.   Or two, the\n            discharge is reasonably  related, in  the\n            employer's   honest   judgment,  to   the\n            economic needs of his business.\n\nThe district court derived  this instruction almost verbatim from\n\na duo of Massachusetts  cases, Goldhor v. Hampshire  College, 521\n                                                            \n\nN.E.2d 1381, 1385 (Mass.  App. Ct. 1988), and Klein  v. President\n                                                                 \n\n                               -4-\n\nand Fellows of Harvard  College, 517 N.E.2d 167, 169  (Mass. App.\n                               \n\nCt. 1987).   Although those  cases stated the  entire just  cause\n\ndefinition, they  focussed on the  first prong, holding  that the\n\nemployee either  did or  did not  meet the performance  standard.\n\nBecause  the  holdings did  not invoke  the  second prong  of the\n\ndefinition, appellant argues that  the economic needs standard is\n\nnot  a part of Massachusetts law but rather dicta by intermediate\n\nstate courts.  As such, it cannot support a jury instruction.\n\n          We  disagree.   When the  highest state  court has  not\n\nissued  a definitive  ruling on  the precise  issue at  hand, the\n\nfederal  courts  may  refer  to  analogous decisions,  considered\n\ndicta, scholarly  works, or  other reliable sources  to ascertain\n\nhow  the highest court would  rule.  Redgrave  v. Boston Symphony\n                                                                 \n\nOrchestra, Inc., 855  F.2d 888,  903 (1st Cir.  1988) (en  banc),\n               \n\ncert.  denied,   488  U.S.  1043   (1989).    The   decisions  of\n             \n\nintermediate  state appellate  courts  are  trustworthy data  for\n\nascertaining state  law.   CPC International, Inc.  v. Northbrook\n                                                                 \n\nExcess &amp; Surplus Insurance Co., 962 F.2d 77, 91 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                              \n\n          The   Massachusetts  Supreme  Judicial  Court  has  not\n\nanswered the precise  issue at  hand -- whether  an employer  may\n\nterminate a fixed-term employee  due to economic  considerations.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Goldhor and Klein were fixed-term employees and\n                                   \n\ntherefore  similarly  situated  to   appellant.    As  such,  the\n\nconsidered dicta  in those  cases concerning terminations  due to\n\neconomic necessity represents a reliable statement  of the law in\n\nMassachusetts.   The district court did not err in relying on it.\n\n                               -5-\n\nThere is no  indication that the  highest court of  Massachusetts\n\nwould define just cause any differently.\n\n          To the contrary, we note that Massachusetts courts have\n\ndefined just cause, or similar language, in a virtually identical\n\nmanner  in  other  contexts.    Goldhor  and  Klein  derived  the\n                                                   \n\ndefinition  of just cause from G  &amp; M Employment Service, Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nCommonwealth, 265 N.E.2d  476 (Mass.  1970).  In  that case,  the\n            \n\nhighest  court  in  Massachusetts  defined  just  cause  for  the\n\npurposes  of a  statute regulating  private employment  agencies.\n\nThe court's definition in  that case was the direct  precursor to\n\nthe definition  used in Goldhor  and Klein.   Other Massachusetts\n                                          \n\ncases  validating premature  terminations  due to  economic  need\n\ninclude Amoco Oil  Co. v.  Dickson, 389 N.E.2d  406 (Mass.  1979)\n                                  \n\n(franchise agreement) and Karcz  v. Luther Manufacturing Co., 155\n                                                            \n\nN.E.2d 441  (Mass. 1959) (collective bargaining  agreement).  See\n                                                                 \n\nalso Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Audi  of America, Inc., 755 F. Supp.\n                                                   \n\n30 (D. Mass. 1991) (franchise agreement).  Appellant has directed\n\nus  to, and  we have found,  no cases involving  just cause which\n\nprohibit economically-motivated terminations.   Given the  weight\n\nof authority,  we believe that  the jury instruction,  taken from\n\nGoldhor and Klein, correctly set forth Massachusetts law.\n                 \n\n          Appellant's second attack  on that instruction  claimed\n\nthat the instruction improperly invaded the province of the jury.\n\nConsistent  with   the  law  on   economically-based  discharges,\n\nhowever, the jury  could decide whether  appellee made an  honest\n\nbusiness judgment to  close the plant.  Appellant  cannot contend\n\n                               -6-\n\nthat the  parties contemplated  just  cause to  have a  different\n\nmeaning in this context because  there was no evidence indicating\n\nthe  existence  of such  an alternate  meaning.   The  court thus\n\nproperly  relied on  the  implied Massachusetts  definition.   We\n\ndecline appellant's invitation to remand the case  for retrial or\n\nto certify the state law question due to the jury instruction.\n\n          We  turn now  to appellant's  arguments  concerning the\n\nexclusion of certain evidence.  Appellant sought to cross-examine\n\na witness  to show  that there  was plenty of  work at  the plant\n\nshortly before its closing.   Appellant hoped that an  officer of\n\nappellee  would relate  testimony from  an NLRB  hearing to  this\n\neffect.   To elicit this  testimony, appellant asked  \"[i]t was a\n\nmatter of some concern  to you that the  employees were going  to\n\norganize,  wasn't  it?\"     Appellee  promptly  objected  to  the\n\nrelevance of the question, and the judge held a bench conference.\n\nAppellant there indicated that he wished  to elicit the testimony\n\nconcerning the amount of work at the plant.  The  district  court\n\nexcluded the testimony because the  supervisor did not testify on\n\ndirect  as  to the  motivation behind  the  plant closing  or the\n\neconomic woes troubling the company.  \n\n          We review a district  court's evidentiary rulings  only\n\nfor abuse of discretion, e.g., Willhauck v. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689,\n                                                  \n\n717 (1st Cir.  1991), and the district court  did not commit such\n\nabuse in this instance.   The new line  of questioning sought  to\n\nestablish  that  the plant  was  not closed  for  honest business\n\nreasons.    The  witness, however,  did  not  testify  as to  the\n\n                               -7-\n\nmotivation for  the company's action on direct  examination.  The\n\ndistrict court  therefore properly  refused to entertain  the new\n\nline of questioning pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 611(b).  \n\n          Of  course, trial judges,  within their discretion, may\n\ndisregard Rule  611(b).  Fed.  R. Evid.  611(b).  We  cannot say,\n\nhowever, that  the district court's  decision to follow  the rule\n\nconstitutes  an   abuse  of  discretion.     The  district  court\n\nreasonably  believed that  the question  threatened prejudice  in\n\nthat it  would ascribe an  unfair anti-union animus  to appellee.\n\nEven  if  appellant sought  to show  that  the plant  closing was\n\nmotivated  by  such animus,  this  single  question supported  by\n\nminimal  explanation  or  proffer  cannot  overcome  Rule 611(b).\n\nAppellant  should have  presented a  more coherent  rationale for\n\npursuing  the  questioning, or  revived  the  questioning when  a\n\nwitness testified as to such motivation.\n\n          Because we have found no cause to remand the case for a\n\nnew  trial,  we need  not address  whether  that trial  should be\n\nlimited  to the breach of contract issues or should encompass all\n\nissues in the case.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -8-\n",

Because we\n\nfind no error in the district court's instructions or evidentiary\n\nrulings, we do not grant appellant his requests.\n\n                            THE FACTS\n                                     \n\n          Appellant is a structural engineer with an expertise in\n\npre-cast concrete  construction.   He worked  as a consultant  on\n\nmatters  involving  pre-cast  concrete  at  appellee's  Stamford,\n\nConnecticut headquarters.  Appellee soon determined that it would\n\nbe more profitable  to make pre-cast  products instead of  buying\n\nthem from  outside vendors.    The company thus set  up a factory\n\nfor this purpose in Pittsfield, Massachusetts and hired appellant\n\nto manage it.\n\n          The  details of  the employment  contract are  in sharp\n\ndispute.    Appellant  contends  that  he  agreed  to manage  the\n\nPittsfield facility for a minimum of three years, in exchange for\n\nsalary and benefits including housing in Pittsfield for the three\n\nyear  term.  Appellee, on the other hand, contends that appellant\n\nwas  an  at-will employee,  as were  all  other employees  of the\n\ncompany.  In  any event,  appellant began work  in Pittsfield  in\n\n                               -2-\n\nAugust, 1987.\n\n          In October 1987, the  company's senior managers visited\n\nthe plant,  announced its  immediate closure, and  terminated all\n\nemployees,  including appellant.   Appellant claims that appellee\n\nclosed  the plant to  thwart union activity.   Appellee, however,\n\ncontends that it  decided to  close the plant  because the  sharp\n\ndownturn  in  the  Northeast  real  estate  market  affected  its\n\nconstruction projects.   Appellee  also claimed  that appellant's\n\nperformance was inadequate.\n\n          Appellant  sued,  claiming that  appellee was  bound by\n\ncontract  to employ him for three years.  Appellee responded that\n\nno  contract  was  formed, but  that  even  if  one existed,  the\n\ntermination  was  for \"just  cause\"  and  therefore proper  under\n\nMassachusetts  law.   During  the trial,  appellant attempted  to\n\ncross-examine a  former supervisor about testimony  at a National\n\nLabor Relations Board hearing to the effect that there was plenty\n\nof work  at the plant.   The hearing occurred  shortly before the\n\nplant's  closing.    The  district court  judge  disallowed  this\n\nquestioning, finding  it beyond the scope  of direct examination,\n\nand more prejudicial than probative.\n\n          At the close of evidence, the district court instructed\n\nthe jury that if a contract existed, termination for \"just cause\"\n\nwould be proper.   The district court judge defined  \"just cause\"\n\nas 1) poor performance by appellant on the job or 2) a good faith\n\ndetermination that  the economic  needs of the  business required\n\nappellant's discharge.  During  deliberations, the jury asked the\n\n                               -3-\n\njudge to repeat its definition of \"just cause.\"  The jury finally\n\nfound that  a contract for fixed-term  employment existed between\n\nthe  parties, but  that  \"just cause\"  allowed  appellee to  fire\n\nappellant.    This appeal  followed  in which  appellant  seeks a\n\nretrial on only the breach of contract claims.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Appellant  urges two  errors in  the  jury instruction.\n\nFirst,  he contends that the instruction does not reflect the law\n\nin Massachusetts as to the definition of just cause.   Second, he\n\nclaims that  the instruction  improperly invaded the  province of\n\nthe  jury,  by  settling a  question  of  fact,  in violation  of\n\nMassachusetts law.  As appellant claims that the jury instruction\n\nincorrectly stated  Massachusetts contract  law, we review  it de\n                                                                 \n\nnovo.

As  such,  the\n\nconsidered dicta  in those  cases concerning terminations  due to\n\neconomic necessity represents a reliable statement  of the law in\n\nMassachusetts.   The district court did not err in relying on it.\n\n                               -5-\n\nThere is no  indication that the  highest court of  Massachusetts\n\nwould define just cause any differently.\n\n          To the contrary, we note that Massachusetts courts have\n\ndefined just cause, or similar language, in a virtually identical\n\nmanner  in  other  contexts.

Appellant has directed\n\nus  to, and  we have found,  no cases involving  just cause which\n\nprohibit economically-motivated terminations.   Given the  weight\n\nof authority,  we believe that  the jury instruction,  taken from\n\nGoldhor and Klein, correctly set forth Massachusetts law.\n                 \n\n          Appellant's second attack  on that instruction  claimed\n\nthat the instruction improperly invaded the province of the jury.\n\nConsistent  with   the  law  on   economically-based  discharges,\n\nhowever, the jury  could decide whether  appellee made an  honest\n\nbusiness judgment to  close the plant.  Appellant  cannot contend\n\n                               -6-\n\nthat the  parties contemplated  just  cause to  have a  different\n\nmeaning in this context because  there was no evidence indicating\n\nthe  existence  of such  an alternate  meaning.   The  court thus\n\nproperly  relied on  the  implied Massachusetts  definition.   We\n\ndecline appellant's invitation to remand the case  for retrial or\n\nto certify the state law question due to the jury instruction.\n\n          We  turn now  to appellant's  arguments  concerning the\n\nexclusion of certain evidence.  Appellant sought to cross-examine\n\na witness  to show  that there  was plenty of  work at  the plant\n\nshortly before its closing.   Appellant hoped that an  officer of\n\nappellee  would relate  testimony from  an NLRB  hearing to  this\n\neffect.   To elicit this  testimony, appellant asked  \"[i]t was a\n\nmatter of some concern  to you that the  employees were going  to\n\norganize,  wasn't  it?\"     Appellee  promptly  objected  to  the\n\nrelevance of the question, and the judge held a bench conference.\n\nAppellant there indicated that he wished  to elicit the testimony\n\nconcerning the amount of work at the plant.  The  district  court\n\nexcluded the testimony because the  supervisor did not testify on\n\ndirect  as  to the  motivation behind  the  plant closing  or the\n\neconomic woes troubling the company.  \n\n          We review a district  court's evidentiary rulings  only\n\nfor abuse of discretion, e.g., Willhauck v. Halpin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                                  \n\n717 (1st Cir.  1991), and the district court  did not commit such\n\nabuse in this instance.   The new line  of questioning sought  to\n\nestablish  that  the plant  was  not closed  for  honest business\n\nreasons.    The  witness, however,  did  not  testify  as to  the\n\n                               -7-\n\nmotivation for  the company's action on direct  examination.  The\n\ndistrict court  therefore properly  refused to entertain  the new\n\nline of questioning pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 611(b).  \n\n          Of  course, trial judges,  within their discretion, may\n\ndisregard Rule  611(b).  Fed.  R. Evid.  611(b).  We  cannot say,\n\nhowever, that  the district court's  decision to follow  the rule\n\nconstitutes  an   abuse  of  discretion.     The  district  court\n\nreasonably  believed that  the question  threatened prejudice  in\n\nthat it  would ascribe an  unfair anti-union animus  to appellee.\n\nEven  if  appellant sought  to show  that  the plant  closing was\n\nmotivated  by  such animus,  this  single  question supported  by\n\nminimal  explanation  or  proffer  cannot  overcome  Rule 611(b).\n\nAppellant  should have  presented a  more coherent  rationale for\n\npursuing  the  questioning, or  revived  the  questioning when  a\n\nwitness testified as to such motivation.\n\n          Because we have found no cause to remand the case for a\n\nnew  trial,  we need  not address  whether  that trial  should be\n\nlimited  to the breach of contract issues or should encompass all\n\nissues in the case.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -8-\n</pre>",
