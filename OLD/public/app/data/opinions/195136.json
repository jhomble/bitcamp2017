In  these   consolidated  appeals,\n                     \n\nplaintiffs-appellants argue that the district  court erred in\n\nsummarily disposing of  their claims relating to  their right\n\nto  a distribution  of the  net worth  of two  mutual savings\n\nbanks (MSBs) following the banks' conversion to stock savings\n\ninstitutions.   See generally Lovell v. Peoples Heritage Sav.\n                                                             \n\nBank, 818  F. Supp. 427 (D. Me. 1993); Lovell v. One Bancorp,\n                                                            \n\n818 F. Supp. 412 (D. Me. 1993).  We affirm.\n\n          Plaintiffs failed to  come forward with proof  of a\n\nconstitutionally-protected    property    interest    in    a\n\ndistribution of the surplus of  the MSBs, the linchpin of the\n\nbulk of their  claims.  In  answering questions certified  by\n\nthe  district court, the  Maine Supreme Judicial  Court (SJC)\n\nheld that Maine law does  not give plaintiffs any right to  a\n\ndistribution of the surplus of MSBs as part of the conversion\n\nprocess.  Lovell v. One Bancorp,  614 A.2d 56, 67 (Me. 1992).\n                               \n\nAbsent a state  property right, plaintiffs' plea  for federal\n\nconstitutional protection is in  vain.  Chongris v.  Board of\n                                                             \n\nAppeals,  811 F.2d  36, 43  (1st  Cir.) (\"[P]roperty  rights,\n       \n\nwhile protected by the federal Constitution, are creatures of\n\nstate law.\")  (citing, inter alia, Board of  Regents v. Roth,\n                                                            \n\n408  U.S.  564, 577  (1972)),  cert.  denied, 483  U.S.  1021\n                                            \n\n(1987).\n\n          Plaintiffs  argue  in  the   alternative  that  the\n\nConstitution at least protects their contingent interest in a\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\ndistribution  of  the  \"liquidation   accounts\"  of  the  new\n\ninstitutions.  These  accounts are the current  repository of\n\nthe reincarnated surplus  of the former MSBs.   While the SJC\n\nopinion does support  plaintiffs' claim to such  an interest,\n\nsee   Lovell,  614   A.2d  at  67   (recognizing  depositors'\n            \n\ncontingent interest in  a pro rata  distribution of a  bank's\n\nsurplus),  plaintiffs have  not  produced trial-worthy  proof\n\nthat the contingency  --  a solvent liquidation -- would ever\n\noccur.  In fact, as the record stands now, it  is essentially\n\nundisputed  that a  solvent  liquidation  is  a  very  remote\n\npossibility.  As  a result, the district court  may have been\n\ncorrect in  concluding that  the contingent  interest in  the\n\nliquidation  accounts  did  not  rise  to  the  level  of  an\n\nexpectancy deserving  constitutional  protection.    See  One\n                                                             \n\nBancorp, 818  F. Supp.  at 420-21;  Peoples Heritage, 818  F.\n                                                    \n\nSupp. at 431;  cf. Society for Sav. v. Bowers,  349 U.S. 143,\n                                             \n\n150  (1955) (observing that  interest of mutual  savings bank\n\ndepositor  in bank's  undivided  earnings, contingent  on the\n\n\"unlikely event of a solvent  liquidation, . . . hardly rises\n\nto the  level of an  expectancy\").  Nonetheless,  rather than\n\nbasing the  availability of constitutional protection  on the\n\nexpected  value of  an alleged  property  interest, we  focus\n\ninstead  on the alternative reasoning offered by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          Even  if   plaintiffs  could  prove   a  cognizable\n\nproperty interest in the liquidation accounts, the undisputed\n\nfacts would  still  support summary  judgment for  defendants\n\nwith  respect to  each  alleged violation  of  constitutional\n\nproperty   rights.     Plaintiffs   have  proven   themselves\n\nsingularly  unable   to  show  any  tangible  financial  harm\n\nsufficient to support a claim  under the Takings Clause,  see\n                                                             \n\nPenn Cent.

Romein, 112 S. Ct. 1105,\n                                           \n\n1109  (1992)  (holding  that  \"substantial  impairment  of  a\n\ncontractual  relationship\"  is  an essential  component  of a\n\nContract Clause  claim) (quoting Allied Structural  Steel Co.\n                                                             \n\nv. Spannaus, 438 U.S.  234, 244 (1978)).   Nor  would a trial\n           \n\nserve   any  useful  purpose  with  respect  to  the  alleged\n\nviolations  of procedural  due  process; it  is  a matter  of\n\nrecord  that plaintiffs had notice of the proposed conversion\n\nand an  opportunity to respond.   We agree with  the district\n\ncourt that plaintiffs were \"entitled to accurate, informative\n\nnotice,  not to  their  particular  characterizations of  the\n\ninformation being disseminated.\"   One Bancorp, 818  F. Supp.\n                                              \n\nat 426.\n\n          We likewise fail to see any merit in the allegation\n\nthat defendants violated  plaintiffs' substantive due process\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nand  equal protection rights.   As explained  in the district\n\ncourt's trenchant opinions below, there are entirely rational\n\nreasons  for the transfer  of the surplus of  the MSBs to the\n\nliquidation accounts of  the new stock institutions,  as well\n\nas the differing rights of account holders in  the conversion\n\nof an  MSB and policy  holders of a mutual  insurance company\n\nduring an arguably analogous conversion.  See  id. at 423-24;\n                                                  \n\nPeoples Heritage, 818 F. Supp. at 431.\n                \n\n          We also agree  with the  district court  concerning\n\nplaintiffs'  state  law  claims.    In  response  to  another\n\ncertified  question,  the  SJC  held  that  plaintiffs   were\n\nprocedurally  barred  from pursuing  their  state common  law\n\nclaims  following  (1)  the  issuance  of  a  certificate  of\n\nconversion by the state and  (2) the failure of plaintiffs to\n\nseek judicial review  under Maine's Administrative  Procedure\n\nAct.   Lovell, 614 A.2d at  62.  Plaintiffs' attempt  to have\n             \n\nthis court overrule or  modify Maine's highest court on  this\n\npoint of state  law is  entirely unavailing.   Moreover,  the\n\ndistrict court is  unquestionably correct in  concluding that\n\nthe logic used  by the SJC  in deciding the viability  of the\n\ncommon law  claims disposes of the state  statutory claims as\n\nwell.   See  One Bancorp,  818  F. Supp.  at 425-26;  Peoples\n                                                             \n\nHeritage, 818 F.  Supp. at 431.  As  all of plaintiffs' state\n        \n\nlaw claims  are  procedurally barred,  summary  judgment  was\n\ninescapably appropriate.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          Accordingly,  the judgments  of the  district court\n\nare\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n",

See generally Lovell v. Peoples Heritage Sav. Bank, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></span> (D. Me. 1993);   Lovell v. One Bancorp, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1491819\"><a href=\"/opinion/1491819/lovell-v-one-bancorp/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span> (D. Me. 1993).  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs failed to come forward with proof of a constitutionally-protected property interest in a distribution of the surplus of the MSBs, the linchpin of the bulk of their claims.  In answering questions certified by the district court, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) held that Maine law does not give plaintiffs any right to a distribution of the surplus of MSBs as part of the conversion process.   Lovell v. One Bancorp, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></span>, 67 (Me. 1992).  Absent a state property right, plaintiffs' plea for federal constitutional protection is in vain.   Chongris v. Board of Appeals, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482848\"><a href=\"/opinion/482848/james-chongris-and-george-chongris-v-board-of-appeals-of-the-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.)  (\"[P]roperty rights, while protected by the federal Constitution, are creatures of state law.\")  (citing,  inter alia, Board of Regents v. Roth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 577 (1972)), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1021</span></span> (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue in the alternative that the Constitution at least protects their contingent interest in a distribution of the \"liquidation accounts\" of the new institutions.  These accounts are the current repository of the reincarnated surplus of the former MSBs. While the SJC opinion does support plaintiffs' claim to such an interest,  see Lovell, 614 A.2d at 67 (recognizing depositors' contingent interest in a pro rata distribution of a bank's surplus), plaintiffs have not produced trial-worthy proof that the contingency-a solvent liquidation-would ever occur.  In fact, as the record stands now, it is essentially undisputed that a solvent liquidation is a very remote possibility.  As a result, the district court may have been correct in concluding that the contingent interest in the liquidation accounts did not rise to the level of an expectancy deserving constitutional protection.   See One Bancorp, 818 F. Supp. at 420-21;   Peoples Heritage, 818 F. Supp. at 431;   cf.  Society for Sav. v. Bowers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105304\"><a href=\"/opinion/105304/society-for-sav-in-cleveland-v-bowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 150 (1955) (observing that interest of mutual savings bank depositor in bank's undivided earnings, contingent on the \"unlikely event of a solvent liquidation, ... hardly rises to the level of an expectancy\").  Nonetheless, rather than basing the availability of constitutional protection on the expected value of an alleged property interest, we focus instead on the alternative reasoning offered by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if plaintiffs could prove a cognizable property interest in the liquidation accounts, the undisputed facts would still support summary judgment for defendants with respect to each alleged violation of constitutional property rights.  Plaintiffs have proven themselves singularly unable to show any tangible financial harm sufficient to support a claim under the Takings Clause,  see Penn Cent. Transp.  Co. v. New York City, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109924\"><a href=\"/opinion/109924/penn-central-transp-co-v-new-york-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 124 (1978) (suggesting that proof of economic impact is essential to show a violation of the Takings Clause), or the Contract Clause, see General Motors Corp. v. Romein, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112703\"><a href=\"/opinion/112703/general-motors-corp-v-romein/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span>, 1109 (1992) (holding that \"substantial impairment of a contractual relationship\" is an essential component of a Contract Clause claim) (quoting  Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109929\"><a href=\"/opinion/109929/allied-structural-steel-co-v-spannaus/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, 244 (1978)).  Nor would a trial serve any useful purpose with respect to the alleged violations of procedural due process;  it is a matter of record that plaintiffs had notice of the proposed conversion and an opportunity to respond.  We agree with the district court that plaintiffs were \"entitled to accurate, informative notice, not to their particular characterizations of the information being disseminated.\"   One Bancorp, 818 F. Supp. at 426.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We likewise fail to see any merit in the allegation that defendants violated plaintiffs' substantive due process and equal protection rights.  As explained in the district court's trenchant opinions below, there are entirely rational reasons for the transfer of the surplus of the MSBs to the liquidation accounts of the new stock institutions, as well as the differing rights of account holders in the conversion of anMSB and policy holders of a mutual insurance company during an arguably analogous conversion.  See id. at 423-24;   Peoples Heritage, 818 F. Supp. at 431.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also agree with the district court concerning plaintiffs' state law claims.  In response to another certified question, the SJC held that plaintiffs were procedurally barred from pursuing their state common law claims following (1) the issuance of a certificate of conversion by the state and (2) the failure of plaintiffs to seek judicial review under Maine's Administrative Procedure Act.   Lovell, 614 A.2d at 62.  Plaintiffs' attempt to have this court overrule or modify Maine's highest court on this point of state law is entirely unavailing.  Moreover, the district court is unquestionably correct in concluding that the logic used by the SJC in deciding the viability of the common law claims disposes of the state statutory claims as well.   See One Bancorp, 818 F. Supp. at 425-26;   Peoples Heritage, 818 F. Supp. at 431.  As all of plaintiffs' state law claims are procedurally barred, summary judgment was inescapably appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgments of the district court are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
