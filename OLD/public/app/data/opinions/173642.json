Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.   This appeal involves a challenge\n\nto the use of trustee process to satisfy, in part, an outstanding\n\njudgment against defendant Emmanuel Pinez.   The plaintiffs in this\n\ncase, victims of a securities fraud and insider trading scheme, won\n\na class action judgment of over $207 million against Mr. Pinez.   In\n\nan attempt to satisfy that judgment, they moved to attach by\n\ntrustee process a securities account at H&R Block.    Although the\n\naccount is held in the name of Taniki Financial Corporation -- an\n\nentity nominally controlled by Mr. Pinez's ex-wife, Rachel Pinez --\n\nthe plaintiffs claim that the account was funded with \"ill-gotten\n\ngains transferred by Mr. Pinez to Taniki\" and that Mr. Pinez\n\nretains a legal or equitable interest in the account.\n\n           In late 2005, the district court granted the plaintiffs'\n\nex parte motion to attach the account and summoned H&R Block as\n\ntrustee.   H&R Block did not file an answer at the time.   In early\n\n2008, the plaintiffs moved to expand their attachment to capture\n\nthe increased value of the account and to charge H&R Block as\n\ntrustee by default.   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 246, § 18 (\"A person\n\nwho, being duly summoned as a trustee, neglects to appear and\n\nanswer as hereinbefore provided shall be defaulted and adjudged a\n\ntrustee.\").   Taniki then joined the action, claiming ownership of\n\nthe H&R Block account and requesting that the ex parte attachment\n\nbe dissolved.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f          The district court denied the dissolution request and\n\ngranted the request to expand the attachment, concluding that the\n\nfunds in the account belong to Mr. Pinez.   The district court then\n\ncharged H&R Block as trustee \"in the amount of $665,320 in partial\n\nsatisfaction of the outstanding judgment against [Mr.] Pinez.\"1\n\nTaniki appeals from the district court's order.\n\n          Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff may attach \"goods,\n\neffects or credits\" that belong to the defendant but are in the\n\nhands of a third party.      Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 246, § 20.     The\n\ntrustee process, as it is called, has two key steps.     First, the\n\nproperty must be secured by a trustee attachment, which is an\n\ninterim remedy used to preserve the property so that it might later\n\nbe taken on execution.   See Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe Mfg.\n\nCorp., 15 F.3d 1222, 1229 (1st Cir. 1994).        Second, the party\n\nholding the property must be \"charged\" as trustee, meaning that\n\nthere must be a final determination that he does, in fact, hold the\n\n\"goods, effects or credits\" of the defendant.\n\n          A trustee attachment can be obtained upon a preliminary\n\nshowing that there \"is a reasonable likelihood that the plaintiff\n\nwill recover judgment, including interest and costs, in an amount\n\nequal to or greater than the amount of the trustee process over and\n\n\n     1\n          The district court's decision to charge H&R Block as\ntrustee was ultimately based on H&R Block's default. H&R Block has\nnot appealed, and Taniki does not contest the validity of the\ndefault judgment. Instead, Taniki focuses on the district court's\nantecedent rejection of its claim to the account.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fabove any liability insurance . . . .\"                  Mass. R. Civ. P. 4.2(c).\n\nAs the language of the Rule suggests, a trustee attachment is\n\nusually sought prior to the entry of judgment on the underlying\n\nclaim.     The     \"central      question\"      in   such     a    case   \"is   whether\n\nplaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits and obtain damages\n\nin the necessary amount.\" Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Rodco Autobody,\n\n138   F.R.D.     328,     332   (D.   Mass.     1991)   (internal         citation   and\n\nquotation marks omitted).             If that question is answered in the\n\nplaintiffs' favor, the district court will issue a summons to the\n\nthird    party    --    the     alleged   \"trustee\"      --       which   compels    his\n\nappearance in court and requires him to hold the defendant's\n\nproperty \"till judgment is obtained, or the action is otherwise\n\ndisposed of, in order that [the property] may be taken on execution\n\nif the plaintiff obtains judgment against the defendant.\" Van Camp\n\nHardware & Iron Co. v. Plimpton, 54 N.E. 538, 538 (Mass. 1899).\n\n            Although pre-judgment attachment is the norm, \"there\n\nappears to be no prohibition against a plaintiff seeking approval\n\nof a trustee attachment after judgment has entered,\" as in this\n\ncase.     48     Jordan    L.   Shapiro   et    al.,    Massachusetts        Practice:\n\nCollection Law § 5:54 (3d ed. & Supp. 2010).                  It is not clear what,\n\nif anything, must be shown to obtain a post-judgment trustee\n\nattachment, since the plaintiff will have already prevailed on the\n\nmerits of the underlying claim.               See id. § 4:56 (\"Once plaintiff\n\nhas in fact recovered judgment, it appears that the plaintiff would\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fbe   able    to   satisfy   the   requirement   of   showing   a    'reasonable\n\nlikelihood' of recovery.\").          This appeal does not require us to\n\nconfront that issue.\n\n              As noted, once the property is secured by an attachment,\n\nthe focus shifts to whether the alleged trustee did, in fact, have\n\n\"goods, effects or credits of the defendant in his hands or\n\npossession\" at the time of the service of the trustee summons.\n\nL.S. Cushing, A Practical Treatise on the Trustee Process 93\n\n(1833).      To that end, the trustee must file an answer disclosing\n\n\"plainly, fully and particularly what goods, effects or credits, if\n\nany, of the defendant\" he possesses.            Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 246,\n\n§ 10.       Depending upon the answer, further fact-finding may be\n\nnecessary.        See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 246, §§ 12-17.           If the court\n\nultimately determines that the trustee holds \"goods, effects or\n\ncredits\" of the defendant, the trustee will be \"charged,\" judgment\n\nwill enter against him, and he must then \"pay over to the creditor\n\nor be subject to a trustee writ of execution.\"          Gabovitch v. Lundy,\n\n584 F.2d 559, 561 n.3 (1st Cir. 1978); see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 246,\n\n§§ 39-44.         The trustee may also be charged by default if he\n\n\"neglects to appear and answer\" within the applicable time period.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 246, § 18.\n\n              At any time before judgment is entered against the\n\ntrustee, additional parties may join the proceeding to claim a\n\nlegal or equitable right to the property in the trustee's hands.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fGeorgeopoulos v. Georgeopoulos, 21 N.E.2d 267, 268 (Mass. 1939).\n\nSuch claimants may allege and prove any facts that have not been\n\nstated or denied by the trustee.      Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 246, § 33.\n\nIf a claimant carries his burden of proving that he is the \"true\n\nowner\" of the property, or that his claim to the property is\n\nsuperior to that of the plaintiff, the trustee will be discharged\n\nand the claimant may recover the property.        Georgeopoulos, 21\n\nN.E.2d at 268; Meteor Prods. Co. v. Societe d'Electro Chimie et\n\nd'Electro Metallurgie, 161 N.E. 875, 876 (Mass. 1928); Hubbard v.\n\nLamburn, 75 N.E. 707, 708 (Mass. 1905).\n\n          Taniki joined the proceedings as a claimant to the H&R\n\nBlock account.   The district court rejected Taniki's claim that it\n\nwas the true owner of the property, however, finding that the H&R\n\nBlock account was funded with Mr. Pinez's money and that Mr. Pinez\n\nretained an interest in the account.2\n\n\n     2\n          The district court held that the plaintiffs \"must\ndemonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the funds held in the\nTaniki account are, in fact, the property of [Mr.] Pinez.\" We find\nnothing in the Massachusetts law of trustee process that would call\nfor applying the \"reasonable likelihood\" standard to the ownership\nissue. The issue before the district court was whether Taniki was,\nin fact, the true owner of the property.           As the parties\nacknowledge, the district court essentially found that Taniki was\nnot the true owner of the property, and that the funds in the\naccount were owned by Mr. Pinez. Taniki has challenged only the\nsufficiency of the evidence underpinning that ownership finding; it\nmade it clear at oral argument that it views this as a \"failure of\nproof case.\" We also note that the district court and the parties\nhave assumed that any funds traceable to Mr. Pinez, and any assets\npurchased with such funds, are subject to attachment and execution\non trustee process. As we did in a related appeal, \"[w]e accept\nthe assumptions of the parties but do not independently endorse\n\n                                -6-\n\f           In Taniki's view, the plaintiffs presented insufficient\n\nevidence to justify that conclusion.          We disagree.      The funds in\n\nthe account were deposited over a fourteen-month period that\n\ncorresponded with Mr. Pinez's fraud and insider trading activity,\n\nand there is evidence that Mr. Pinez deposited over $1.5 million\n\ninto other accounts held in Taniki's name during that same period.\n\nThere is no evidence that the Taniki account was used outside of\n\nthat fourteen-month period; the account lay dormant for at least\n\nsix years after the last of the original deposits was made.              It is\n\nalso undisputed that two of the deposits were made by Stanbridge\n\nLimited, an entity controlled by Mr. Pinez, and that another\n\ndeposit corresponds in date and amount to a check drawn on Mr.\n\nPinez's personal bank account.\n\n           Against   this    large   body   of     circumstantial   evidence,\n\nTaniki and Ms. Pinez have presented only uncorroborated claims that\n\nMs. Pinez deposited most of the funds into the Taniki account\n\nherself.    Ms.   Pinez     also   claims   that    the   Stanbridge   Limited\n\ndeposits were intended as repayment for a loan that she had\n\npreviously made to Mr. Pinez.        However, the district court did not\n\ncredit these self-serving assertions and resolved the evidentiary\n\ndispute in the plaintiffs' favor.           It did not err in so doing.\n\nSimply put, the evidence strongly supports the finding that Mr.\n\nPinez used the Taniki account to store his own funds, and Taniki\n\n\nthem.\"   SEC v. Lehman Bros., Inc., 157 F.3d 2, 5 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                     -7-\n\fand   Ms.   Pinez   have   not   provided   a   convincing   alternative\n\nexplanation of the funds' provenance.3\n\n            AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          The record suggests a variety of other issues, but none\nof them has been briefed or argued before us. This opinion should\nnot be read, therefore, as deciding any issues other than those\nspecifically discussed above.\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

The district court rejected Taniki's claim that it\n\nwas the true owner of the property, however, finding that the H&R\n\nBlock account was funded with Mr. Pinez's money and that Mr. Pinez\n\nretained an interest in the account.2\n\n\n     2\n          The district court held that the plaintiffs \"must\ndemonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the funds held in the\nTaniki account are, in fact, the property of [Mr.] Pinez.\" We find\nnothing in the Massachusetts law of trustee process that would call\nfor applying the \"reasonable likelihood\" standard to the ownership\nissue. The issue before the district court was whether Taniki was,\nin fact, the true owner of the property.           As the parties\nacknowledge, the district court essentially found that Taniki was\nnot the true owner of the property, and that the funds in the\naccount were owned by Mr. Pinez. Taniki has challenged only the\nsufficiency of the evidence underpinning that ownership finding; it\nmade it clear at oral argument that it views this as a \"failure of\nproof case.\" We also note that the district court and the parties\nhave assumed that any funds traceable to Mr. Pinez, and any assets\npurchased with such funds, are subject to attachment and execution\non trustee process. As we did in a related appeal, \"[w]e accept\nthe assumptions of the parties but do not independently endorse\n\n                                -6-\n\f           In Taniki's view, the plaintiffs presented insufficient\n\nevidence to justify that conclusion.          We disagree.      The funds in\n\nthe account were deposited over a fourteen-month period that\n\ncorresponded with Mr. Pinez's fraud and insider trading activity,\n\nand there is evidence that Mr. Pinez deposited over $1.5 million\n\ninto other accounts held in Taniki's name during that same period.\n\nThere is no evidence that the Taniki account was used outside of\n\nthat fourteen-month period; the account lay dormant for at least\n\nsix years after the last of the original deposits was made.              It is\n\nalso undisputed that two of the deposits were made by Stanbridge\n\nLimited, an entity controlled by Mr. Pinez, and that another\n\ndeposit corresponds in date and amount to a check drawn on Mr.\n\nPinez's personal bank account.\n\n           Against   this    large   body   of     circumstantial   evidence,\n\nTaniki and Ms. Pinez have presented only uncorroborated claims that\n\nMs. Pinez deposited most of the funds into the Taniki account\n\nherself.    Ms.   Pinez     also   claims   that    the   Stanbridge   Limited\n\ndeposits were intended as repayment for a loan that she had\n\npreviously made to Mr. Pinez.        However, the district court did not\n\ncredit these self-serving assertions and resolved the evidentiary\n\ndispute in the plaintiffs' favor.           It did not err in so doing.\n\nSimply put, the evidence strongly supports the finding that Mr.\n\nPinez used the Taniki account to store his own funds, and Taniki\n\n\nthem.\"   SEC v.
