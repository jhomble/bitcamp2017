Parrilla-Tirado  (Parrilla)\n\nmoved to  withdraw it pursuant  to Fed. R.  Crim. P. 32(d).   The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion and thereafter imposed sentence.\n\nParrilla appeals.  We affirm.\n\nI.  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n\n          On April 24, 1991, appellant and  a companion, Angel M.\n\nConcepcion-Roberto  (Concepcion), were apprehended  after a high-\n\nspeed chase.  The  authorities discovered a firearm on  the front\n\npassenger seat  of their  car.1  On  September 18, 1991,  a grand\n\njury returned a two-count indictment.   Count 1 charged appellant\n\nwith  violating 18  U.S.C.    922(g)(1)  (1988),  a statute  that\n\nrenders it unlawful for a convicted felon, among other things, to\n\n\"transport  in interstate or  foreign commerce, or  possess in or\n\naffecting  commerce, any  firearm,\" and  also charged  Concepcion\n\nwith assisting the crime's commission in  violation of the aiding\n\nand abetting statute, 18 U.S.C.   2(a) (1988).   Count 2 reversed\n\nthe  defendants'   roles,  charging  that   Concepcion  knowingly\n\ntransported and/or possessed the  firearm in violation of section\n\n922(g)(1), and that appellant aided and abetted him.\n\n          Appellant was  arraigned before  a magistrate judge  in\n\nFebruary  of   1992.    Notwithstanding  the   structure  of  the\n\nindictment,  the   Assistant   United  States   Attorney   (AUSA)\n\ninexplicably  told  the  magistrate  that   appellant  was  being\n\n                    \n\n     1The record  reflects that  Concepcion had been  driving the\nvehicle and that appellant had occupied the front passenger seat.\n\n                                2\n\nprosecuted exclusively on count  1.  Consequently, the magistrate\n\narraigned appellant only on that count.  He pled not guilty.\n\n          Four   months   later,   appellant,  through   counsel,\n\nnegotiated a non-binding plea  agreement with the government, see\n                                                                 \n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(A), under  which he agreed to admit his\n\nguilt  on count 1 and the  government agreed to seek dismissal of\n\nthe charge  leveled against him in  count 2.  In  due course, the\n\ndistrict  court allowed appellant's change of plea.  In September\n\n1992, the probation office compiled and delivered the presentence\n\ninvestigation  report (PSI  Report).   In December,  after having\n\nbeen  afforded  an  opportunity  to scrutinize  the  PSI  Report,\n\nappellant  moved to withdraw his plea.  The district court denied\n\nthe  motion, primarily  on the  ground that  appellant's asserted\n\nreasons lacked  \"force and  plausibility.\"  Soon  thereafter, the\n\ncourt sentenced appellant on count 1 and dismissed count 2.\n\n          Appellant  now  asserts that  no  consideration existed\n\nwithin  the  plea  bargain  to  support  the  guilty  plea,  and,\n\ntherefore, that he should have been allowed to withdraw it.  This\n\nassertion rests  on two theses:   (1) that the AUSA  indicated at\n\narraignment  that count 2 did not involve appellant; and (2) that\n\nthe  two  counts  were,   in  all  events,  multiplicitous,  and,\n\nconsequently, pleading  guilty to one count  effectively disposed\n\nof the other.\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          We first set in place the framework under which motions\n\nto  withdraw pleas  must  be  analyzed,  and  then  turn  to  the\n\n                                3\n\nspecifics of appellant's asseverational array.\n\n                        A.  The Framework.\n                                         \n\n          Trial judges  are the  judiciary's infantry:   they man\n\nthe front lines  and, therefore, possess special insight into the\n\ndynamics of the  cases over which they preside.   In deference to\n\nthat insight, we review the district court's decision to grant or\n\ndeny a  request to  withdraw a  guilty plea solely  for abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.  See  United States v. Doyle, 981 F.2d  591, 594 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1992); United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1538 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1989).\n\n          Although  a motion  to  withdraw a  guilty plea  before\n\nsentencing  is determined under a less  stringent standard than a\n\nmotion made after sentencing, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(d) advisory\n                                 \n\ncommittee's note, a defendant does not have an automatic right to\n\nwithdraw his plea even  at that comparatively early stage.   See \n                                                                \n\nUnited  States v.  Buckley, 847  F.2d 991,  998 (1st  Cir. 1988),\n                          \n\ncert.  denied, 488 U.S.  1015 (1989); United  States v. Kobrosky,\n                                                                \n\n711 F.2d 449, 454 (1st  Cir. 1983).  Rather, such a motion can be\n\ngranted before  sentencing only upon an affirmative  showing of a\n\n\"fair and  just reason.\"  Fed. R. Crim. P.  32(d).  The devoir of\n\npersuasion as to  the existence of such  a reason rests  with the\n\ndefendant.   See United States  v. Gonzalez, 970  F.2d 1095, 1100\n                                           \n\n(2d  Cir. 1992);  see  also  Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  32(d)  advisory\n                           \n\ncommittee's note.\n\n          To gauge  whether  the asserted  ground for  withdrawal\n\nmeets the Rule 32(d)  standard, a court must look  at the overall\n\n                                4\n\nsituation, most  prominently (1) the plausibility  of the reasons\n\nprompting the requested  change of  plea; (2) the  timing of  the\n\ndefendant's  motion;  (3) the  existence  or  nonexistence of  an\n\nassertion  of innocence; and (4) whether, when viewed in light of\n\nemergent circumstances, the defendant's plea appropriately may be\n\ncharacterized as involuntary,  in derogation of  the requirements\n\nimposed  by Fed. R. Crim.  P. 11,2 or  otherwise legally suspect.\n\nSee  Doyle, 981 F.2d  at 594; Pellerito,  878 F.2d at  1537.  And\n                                       \n\nthere is  a final  barrier that  must be surmounted:   even  if a\n\ndefendant appears at first  blush to meet the strictures  of this\n\nfour-part  test, the  nisi prius  court still  must evaluate  the\n                                \n\nproposed  plea   withdrawal  in  relation   to  any  demonstrable\n\nprejudice  that will accrue to the government if the defendant is\n\npermitted to  alter  his stance.   See  Doyle, 981  F.2d at  594;\n                                             \n\nPellerito, 878 F.2d at 1537.\n         \n\n                   B.  Applying the Framework.\n                                             \n\n          We  run  the gauntlet  of relevant  factors, discussing\n\nthem in sequence.\n\n          1.  Plausibility of the Asserted Reasons.  A  defendant\n          1.  Plausibility of the Asserted Reasons.\n                                                  \n\nbent on withdrawing  a guilty plea ordinarily  must demonstrate a\n\nplausible reason for  doing so.  See United States v. Tilley, 964\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 66, 72 (1st Cir. 1992).   In this context, plausibility must\n\n                    \n\n     2Three facets of  Rule 11 are  especially important in  this\nrespect.   Rule 11(c) prescribes, in exquisite detail, the advice\nthat a court must give  to a defendant who indicates a  desire to\nenter  a  guilty plea.   Rule  11(d)  prescribes a  procedure for\nensuring  that any  plea  is voluntary  in  nature.   Rule  11(e)\noutlines  a series  of  safeguards referable  to plea  agreements\nbetween accuser and accused.\n\n                                5\n\nrest on more than the defendant's second thoughts about some fact\n\nor point of  law, see  United States v.  Nichols, 986 F.2d  1199,\n                                                \n\n1203  (8th Cir.  1993),  or  about  the  wisdom  of  his  earlier\n\ndecision, see United  States v.  Austin, 948 F.2d  783, 787  (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1991).  We do not think that either of appellant's proffered\n\nreasons can vault this hurdle.\n\n          a.  Refined to bare essence, appellant's flagship claim\n          a.\n\nis that, because the  government did not intend to  prosecute him\n\nunder count  2, he received nothing of  value in exchange for his\n\nplea  to count  1.   This argument  prescinds from  a presentable\n\npremise:  after all, we frequently have said that plea agreements\n\nare contractual in nature.   See, e.g., United States  v. Atwood,\n                                                                \n\n963 F.2d 476, 479  (1st Cir. 1992); United  States v. Hogan,  862\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 386,  389 (1st Cir.  1988).   But this analogy  can only  be\n\ncarried  so far.  Any time a defendant pleads guilty, he receives\n\nsome built-in benefits,  cf., e.g.,  Corbitt v.  New Jersey,  439\n                                                           \n\nU.S. 212,  224 n.14 (1978) (discussing  leniency usually accorded\n\nto  defendants who  plead guilty  as opposed  to those  who stand\n\ntrial); U.S.S.G.   3E1.1 (making available  reduction in  offense\n\nlevel  for acceptance  of  responsibility), and  so  long as  the\n\ngovernment does not make  a material misrepresentation, renege on\n\na promise, or breach the plea agreement, see, e.g., Santobello v.\n                                                              \n\nNew York,  404 U.S. 257, 262  (1971), we do not  believe that any\n        \n\nfurther consideration is essential to support a guilty plea.\n\n          In any  event, appellant  received the full  benefit of\n\nhis  bargain in this case.  The indictment made manifest, and the\n\n                                6\n\nplea  agreement confirmed,  the grand  jury's decision  to charge\n\nappellant with two crimes,  not one.  Although appellant  had not\n                  \n\nbeen arraigned on count 2,  that was a matter of mere  mechanics.\n\nHe  could have  been arraigned,  and, ultimately,  prosecuted, at\n\nvirtually any time.3  Thus, count  2 remained a viable option and\n\nthe   dismissal  of   it  benefitted  appellant.     Accordingly,\n\nappellant's  first asserted  reason for  seeking to  withdraw his\n\nplea lacks force.\n\n          b.   As an  alternative reason, appellant  asserts that\n          b.\n\nthe dismissal of count 2 did not amount to valuable consideration\n\nbecause the two counts  of the indictment in reality  comprised a\n\nsingle charge.  This assertion mischaracterizes the components of\n\nthe indictment and the relationship of the counts inter sese.\n                                                            \n\n          We do not dispute the  basic proposition on which  this\n\nassertion is founded.   Indeed,  it is apodictic  that no  person\n\nshall  \"be subject  for  the  same offence  to  be  twice put  in\n\njeopardy of life or limb.\"  U.S. Const.,  amend. V.  To this end,\n\nthe  Double Jeopardy  Clause shields  a defendant  from a  second\n\nprosecution for the same  offense after either an acquittal  or a\n\nconviction,  and   also  shields   a   defendant  from   multiple\n\n                    \n\n     3To  be sure, an overlong period of delay between indictment\nand   arraignment  might   vitiate  the   prospects  for   future\nprosecution.  See U.S.  Const. amend. VI; see also  United States\n                                                                 \nv. Mala, 7  F.3d 1058, 1061 (1st Cir. 1993).  But the delay here,\n       \nas of the time  appellant negotiated the plea agreement,  was not\noverly  protracted.   And  in any  event,  even an  extraordinary\nperiod of delay in arraigning  a defendant does not automatically\nannul  an indictment, but merely  serves, if and  when raised, to\ntrigger an analysis of relevant factors that eventually  may lead\nto a  dismissal of the charge.   See, e.g., Barker  v. Wingo, 407\n                                                            \nU.S. 514, 530 (1972); Mala, 7 F.3d at 1062 n.3.\n                          \n\n                                7\n\npunishments for the same offense.  See Jones v. Thomas, 491  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n376, 380-81  (1989); United  States v. Rivera-Martinez,  931 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n148, 152 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  112 S. Ct. 184 (1991).  Thus,\n                                 \n\nan indictment may be regarded as repugnant to the Double Jeopardy\n\nClause  if it  charges a  single offense  in more  than a  single\n\ncount.  See  United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d  300, 302 (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1992).\n\n          The  Supreme   Court  has  spoken  to   this  topic  in\n\nunambiguous terms:\n\n          The applicable rule  is that  where the  same\n          act or transaction constitutes a violation of\n          two distinct statutory  provisions, the  test\n          to be applied to  determine whether there are\n          two  offenses or  only  one, is  whether each\n          provision requires proof of  a fact which the\n          other does not.\n\nBlockburger  v. United  States, 284  U.S. 299,  304 (1932).   If,\n                              \n\napplying the  Blockburger test,  the crimes charged  are discrete\n                         \n\noffenses, the defendant may be prosecuted  for both offenses even\n\nthough they  arise out of  the same  conduct, but  if the  crimes\n\ncharged have  the same elements, or  if one is  a lesser included\n\noffense of the other, double jeopardy  at some point will bar the\n\ndoor.   See United States v.  Dixon, 113 S. Ct.  2849, 2857, 2860\n                                   \n\n(1993); United  States v. Colon-Osorio,  10 F.3d  41, 45-46  (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1993).\n\n          Under Blockburger, appellant's claim fails.  Count 1 of\n                           \n\nthe indictment  requires a  showing that appellant,  after having\n\nbeen convicted of a felony, transported  or possessed the firearm\n\ndiscovered by  the police.  See  18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1).   Count 2\n                               \n\n                                8\n\nrequires a  showing that  Concepcion, rather than  appellant, had\n\nbeen convicted  of a prior  felony, that Concepcion,  rather than\n\nappellant, knowingly transported  or possessed  the firearm,  and\n\nthat appellant, rather  than Concepcion, aided  and abetted.   On\n\nthe allegations contained in that count, appellant could not have\n\nbeen  convicted  under  section  922(g)(1), but  only  under  the\n\nseparate aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C.   2(a).  Plainly,\n\nthen, the elements of  the two offenses are distinct  rather than\n\nidentical.   Hence, there is  no multiplicitousness.   See Colon-\n                                                                 \n\nOsorio, 10 F.2d at 45.\n      \n\n          2.    Timing.   The timing  of a  motion to  withdraw a\n          2.    Timing.\n                      \n\nguilty  plea is  significant.   Delayed  requests,  even if  made\n\nbefore  sentencing, are  generally regarded  with disfavor.   See\n                                                                 \n\nPellerito,  878 F.2d  at 1541.   The  rule of  thumb is  that the\n         \n\nlonger  a defendant waits before moving to withdraw his plea, the\n\nmore  potency his  motion must  have in  order to  gain favorable\n\nconsideration.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595.\n                         \n\n          In  this  case,  appellant  waited  roughly six  months\n\nbefore he moved to withdraw his plea.  And, moreover, his belated\n\nchange  of  heart followed  not  long after  the  PSI Report    a\n\ndocument which contained, inter alia, information suggesting that\n                                    \n\na stiff sentence loomed    arrived at the court's doorstep.4   In\n\nappellant's case, then, a simple  chronology of events serves  to\n\n                    \n\n     4The PSI  Report not  only suggested a  guideline sentencing\nrange of 188-235 months,  but also indicated that grounds  for an\nupward  departure might  exist.   Appellant  filed his  motion to\nwithdraw shortly after  having had an opportunity to  examine the\nreport.\n\n                                9\n\ncast a long shadow  over the legitimacy of his  professed reasons\n\nfor  seeking  to  change  course.    Courts  need  not  accept  a\n\ndefendant's  explanations  uncritically.   See generally   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 708 (1st Cir. 1994) (reminding us\n                 \n\nthat \"[t]here are limits to coincidence\").\n\n          3.   Claim  of  Innocence.   In  determining whether  a\n          3.   Claim  of  Innocence.\n                                   \n\nproposed  plea  withdrawal  is   fair  and  just,  a  defendant's\n\nassertion  of  innocence  may  weight  the  scales  in  favor  of\n\nwithdrawal, and conversely,  the absence of a  claim of innocence\n\nweights  the opposite pan of the scales.   See Doyle, 981 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n596; Kobrosky, 711  F.2d at  455.  Appellant  derives no  comfort\n             \n\nfrom this  tenet.  In his  motion papers, he did  not profess his\n\ninnocence.    Thus, this  factor  cuts  sharply against  allowing\n\nappellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\n          4.  Other Considerations.  Other considerations can, of\n          4.  Other Considerations.\n                                  \n\ncourse,  influence  whether  a  defendant should  be  allowed  to\n\nwithdraw   a  guilty  plea.     Here,  however,   we  discern  no\n\nmiscellaneous considerations that counsel in favor  of permitting\n\nappellant  to withdraw  his plea.   To  the contrary,  the record\n\ndiscloses that appellant entered  the plea voluntarily, with full\n\nknowledge of the  terms of  the plea agreement,  see Austin,  948\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  at 787, and under  circumstances wherein the plea evidenced\n\nan intentional relinquishment of a known right.\n\n          Furthermore,   despite   the  AUSA's   misstatement  at\n\narraignment, the key facts were at  appellant's disposal from the\n\nvery  outset.  The indictment itself was crystal clear.  The plea\n\n                                10\n\nagreement was  pellucid in  its  description of  the two  counts.\n\nThen, too, the  court explained matters fully  during the change-\n\nof-plea  hearing   and  appellant  assured  the   court  that  he\n\nunderstood  both  the agreement  (which  he had  signed)  and the\n\nconsequences of the ensuing plea.  He also assured the court that\n\nhe entered into  the plea and the plea agreement  of his own free\n\nwill.\n\n          We will  not paint the lily.   It is the  policy of the\n\nlaw to  hold litigants to  their assurances.   As we wrote  in an\n\nanalogous case, \"[w]e  will not  permit a defendant  to turn  his\n\nback  on his own representations  to the court  merely because it\n\nwould  suit his convenience  to do so.\"   Pellerito, 878  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n1539.  So it is here.\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go no  further.5  Given reasons for  withdrawal\n\nthat are lacking in plausibility, an  extended time lapse between\n\nthe original plea and the motion to withdraw, the  absence of any\n\nassertion of innocence, the district court's scrupulous adherence\n\nto the  dictates of Rule  11, and  the totality of  the attendant\n\ncircumstances, we  discern no  hint of  discretion abused  in the\n\ncourt's refusal to permit appellant to withdraw his  guilty plea.\n\nTo be blunt, appellant had no entitlement to a second bite of the\n\nfig   and we will not afford him one.\n\n                    \n\n     5Because appellant has utterly failed to  present a fair and\njust reason  for plea withdrawal,  we need  not discuss  possible\nprejudice to  the government.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 1991, appellant and a companion, Angel M. Concepcion-Roberto (Concepcion), were apprehended after a high-speed chase.  The authorities discovered a firearm on the front passenger seat of their car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On September 18, 1991, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment.  Count 1 charged appellant with violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1) (1988), a statute that renders it unlawful for a convicted felon, among other things, to \"transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm,\" and also charged Concepcion with assisting the crime's commission in violation of the aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2(a) (1988).  Count 2 reversed the defendants' roles, charging that Concepcion knowingly transported and/or possessed the firearm in violation of section 922(g)(1), and that appellant aided and abetted him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was arraigned before a magistrate judge in February of 1992.  Notwithstanding the structure of the indictment, the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) inexplicably told the magistrate that appellant was being prosecuted exclusively on count 1.  Consequently, the magistrate arraigned appellant only on that count.  He pled not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four months later, appellant, through counsel, negotiated a non-binding plea agreement with the government, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(A), under which he agreed to admit his guilt on count 1 and the government agreed to seek dismissal of the charge leveled against him in count 2.  In due course, the district court allowed appellant's change of plea.  In September 1992, the probation office compiled and delivered the presentence investigation report (PSI Report).  In December, after having been afforded an opportunity to scrutinize the PSI Report, appellant moved to withdraw his plea.  The district court denied the motion, primarily on the ground that appellant's asserted reasons lacked \"force and plausibility.\"   Soon thereafter, the court sentenced appellant on count 1 and dismissed count 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant now asserts that no consideration existed within the plea bargain to support the guilty plea, and, therefore, that he should have been allowed to withdraw it.  This assertion rests on two theses:  (1) that the AUSA indicated at arraignment that count 2 did not involve appellant;  and (2) that the two counts were, in all events, multiplicitous, and, consequently, pleading guilty to one count effectively disposed of the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first set in place the framework under which motions to withdraw pleas must be analyzed, and then turn to the specifics of appellant's asseverational array.A. The Framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial judges are the judiciary's infantry:  they man the front lines and, therefore, possess special insight into the dynamics of the cases over which they preside.  In deference to that insight, we review the district court's decision to grant or deny a request to withdraw a guilty plea solely for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Doyle, 981 F.2d 591, 594 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1538 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a motion to withdraw a guilty plea before sentencing is determined under a less stringent standard than a motion made after sentencing, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d) advisory committee's note, a defendant does not have an automatic right to withdraw his plea even at that comparatively early stage.  See United States v. Buckley, 847 F.2d 991, 998 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1015, 109 S.Ct. 808, 102 L.Ed.2d 798 (1989);  United States v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 454 (1st Cir.1983).  Rather, such a motion can be granted before sentencing only upon an affirmative showing of a \"fair and just reason.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d).  The devoir of persuasion as to the existence of such a reason rests with the defendant.  See United States v. Gonzalez, 970 F.2d 1095, 1100 (2d Cir.1992);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d) advisory committee's note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To gauge whether the asserted ground for withdrawal meets the Rule 32(d) standard, a court must look at the overall situation, most prominently (1) the plausibility of the reasons prompting the requested change of plea;  (2) the timing of the defendant's motion;  (3) the existence or nonexistence of an assertion of innocence;  and (4) whether, when viewed in light of emergent circumstances, the defendant's plea appropriately may be characterized as involuntary, in derogation of the requirements imposed by Fed.R.Crim.P. 11,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> or otherwise legally suspect.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 594;  Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1537.   And there is a final barrier that must be surmounted:  even if a defendant appears at first blush to meet the strictures of this four-part test, the nisi prius court still must evaluate the proposed plea withdrawal in relation to any demonstrable prejudice that will accrue to the government if the defendant is permitted to alter his stance.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 594;  Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1537.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>B. Applying the Framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We run the gauntlet of relevant factors, discussing them in sequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Plausibility of the Asserted Reasons.   A defendant bent on withdrawing a guilty plea ordinarily must demonstrate a plausible reason for doing so.  See United States v. Tilley, 964 F.2d 66, 72 (1st Cir.1992).  In this context, plausibility must rest on more than the defendant's second thoughts about some fact or point of law, see United States v. Nichols, 986 F.2d 1199, 1203 (8th Cir.1993), or about the wisdom of his earlier decision, see United States v. Austin, 948 F.2d 783, 787 (1st Cir.1991).  We do not think that either of appellant's proffered reasons can vault this hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Refined to bare essence, appellant's flagship claim is that, because the government did not intend to prosecute him under count 2, he received nothing of value in exchange for his plea to count 1.  This argument prescinds from a presentable premise:  after all, we frequently have said that plea agreements are contractual in nature.  See, e.g., United States v. Atwood, 963 F.2d 476, 479 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Hogan, 862 F.2d 386, 389 (1st Cir.1988).  But this analogy can only be carried so far.  Any time a defendant pleads guilty, he receives some built-in benefits, cf., e.g., Corbitt v. New Jersey, 439 U.S. 212, 224 n. 14, 99 S.Ct. 492, 500 n. 14, 58 L.Ed.2d 466 (1978) (discussing leniency usually accorded to defendants who plead guilty as opposed to those who stand trial);  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 (making available reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility), and so long as the government does not make a material misrepresentation, renege on a promise, or breach the plea agreement, see, e.g., Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), we do not believe that any further consideration is essential to support a guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, appellant received the full benefit of his bargain in this case.  The indictment made manifest, and the plea agreement confirmed, the grand jury's decision to charge appellant with two crimes, not one.  Although appellant had not been arraigned on count 2, that was a matter of mere mechanics.  He could have been arraigned, and, ultimately, prosecuted, at virtually any time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Thus, count 2 remained a viable option and the dismissal of it benefitted appellant.  Accordingly, appellant's first asserted reason for seeking to withdraw his plea lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. As an alternative reason, appellant asserts that the dismissal of count 2 did not amount to valuable consideration because the two counts of the indictment in reality comprised a single charge.  This assertion mischaracterizes the components of the indictment and the relationship of the counts inter sese.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not dispute the basic proposition on which this assertion is founded.  Indeed, it is apodictic that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"   U.S. Const., amend.  V.  To this end, the Double Jeopardy Clause shields a defendant from a second prosecution for the same offense after either an acquittal or a conviction, and also shields a defendant from multiple punishments for the same offense.  See Jones v. Thomas, 491 U.S. 376, 380-81, 109 S.Ct. 2522, 2525-26, 105 L.Ed.2d 322 (1989);   United States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 184, 116 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991).  Thus, an indictment may be regarded as repugnant to the Double Jeopardy Clause if it charges a single offense in more than a single count.   See United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 302 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has spoken to this topic in unambiguous terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>The applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).  If, applying the Blockburger test, the crimes charged are discrete offenses, the defendant may be prosecuted for both offenses even though they arise out of the same conduct, but if the crimes charged have the same elements, or if one is a lesser included offense of the other, double jeopardy at some point will bar the door.  See United States v. Dixon, --- U.S. ----, ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 2857, 2860, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993);  United States v. Colon-Osorio, 10 F.3d 41, 45-46 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Blockburger, appellant's claim fails.  Count 1 of the indictment requires a showing that appellant, after having been convicted of a felony, transported or possessed the firearm discovered by the police.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1).  Count 2 requires a showing that Concepcion, rather than appellant, had been convicted of a prior felony, that Concepcion, rather than appellant, knowingly transported or possessed the firearm, and that appellant, rather than Concepcion, aided and abetted.  On the allegations contained in that count, appellant could not have been convicted under section 922(g)(1), but only under the separate aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2(a).  Plainly, then, the elements of the two offenses are distinct rather than identical.  Hence, there is no multiplicitousness.  See Colon-Osorio, 10 F.2d at 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Timing.   The timing of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is significant.  Delayed requests, even if made before sentencing, are generally regarded with disfavor.  See Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1541.   The rule of thumb is that the longer a defendant waits before moving to withdraw his plea, the more potency his motion must have in order to gain favorable consideration.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, appellant waited roughly six months before he moved to withdraw his plea.  And, moreover, his belated change of heart followed not long after the PSI Report--a document which contained, inter alia, information suggesting that a stiff sentence loomed--arrived at the court's doorstep.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In appellant's case, then, a simple chronology of events serves to cast a long shadow over the legitimacy of his professed reasons for seeking to change course.  Courts need not accept a defendant's explanations uncritically.  See generally United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 708 (1st Cir.1994) (reminding us that \"[t]here are limits to coincidence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Claim of Innocence.   In determining whether a proposed plea withdrawal is fair and just, a defendant's assertion of innocence may weight the scales in favor of withdrawal, and conversely, the absence of a claim of innocence weights the opposite pan of the scales.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596;  Kobrosky, 711 F.2d at 455.   Appellant derives no comfort from this tenet.  In his motion papers, he did not profess his innocence.  Thus, this factor cuts sharply against allowing appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Other Considerations.   Other considerations can, of course, influence whether a defendant should be allowed to withdraw a guilty plea.  Here, however, we discern no miscellaneous considerations that counsel in favor of permitting appellant to withdraw his plea.  To the contrary, the record discloses that appellant entered the plea voluntarily, with full knowledge of the terms of the plea agreement, see Austin, 948 F.2d at 787, and under circumstances wherein the plea evidenced an intentional relinquishment of a known right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, despite the AUSA's misstatement at arraignment, the key facts were at appellant's disposal from the very outset.  The indictment itself was crystal clear.  The plea agreement was pellucid in its description of the two counts.  Then, too, the court explained matters fully during the change-of-plea hearing and appellant assured the court that he understood both the agreement (which he had signed) and the consequences of the ensuing plea.  He also assured the court that he entered into the plea and the plea agreement of his own free will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  It is the policy of the law to hold litigants to their assurances.  As we wrote in an analogous case, \"[w]e will not permit a defendant to turn his back on his own representations to the court merely because it would suit his convenience to do so.\"  Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1539.   So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Given reasons for withdrawal that are lacking in plausibility, an extended time lapse between the original plea and the motion to withdraw, the absence of any assertion of innocence, the district court's scrupulous adherence to the dictates of Rule 11, and the totality of the attendant circumstances, we discern no hint of discretion abused in the court's refusal to permit appellant to withdraw his guilty plea.  To be blunt, appellant had no entitlement to a second bite of the fig--and we will not afford him one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record reflects that Concepcion had been driving the vehicle and that appellant had occupied the front passenger seat</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Three facets of Rule 11 are especially important in this respect.  Rule 11(c) prescribes, in exquisite detail, the advice that a court must give to a defendant who indicates a desire to enter a guilty plea.  Rule 11(d) prescribes a procedure for ensuring that any plea is voluntary in nature.  Rule 11(e) outlines a series of safeguards referable to plea agreements between accuser and accused</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To be sure, an overlong period of delay between indictment and arraignment might vitiate the prospects for future prosecution.  See U.S. Const. amend.  VI;  see also United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1061 (1st Cir.1993).  But the delay here, as of the time appellant negotiated the plea agreement, was not overly protracted.  And in any event, even an extraordinary period of delay in arraigning a defendant does not automatically annul an indictment, but merely serves, if and when raised, to trigger an analysis of relevant factors that eventually may lead to a dismissal of the charge.  See, e.g., Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972);  Mala, 7 F.3d at 1062 n. 3</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The PSI Report not only suggested a guideline sentencing range of 188-235 months, but also indicated that grounds for an upward departure might exist.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 1991, appellant and a companion, Angel M. Concepcion-Roberto (Concepcion), were apprehended after a high-speed chase.  The authorities discovered a firearm on the front passenger seat of their car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On September 18, 1991, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment.  Count 1 charged appellant with violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1) (1988), a statute that renders it unlawful for a convicted felon, among other things, to \"transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm,\" and also charged Concepcion with assisting the crime's commission in violation of the aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2(a) (1988).  Count 2 reversed the defendants' roles, charging that Concepcion knowingly transported and/or possessed the firearm in violation of section 922(g)(1), and that appellant aided and abetted him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was arraigned before a magistrate judge in February of 1992.  Notwithstanding the structure of the indictment, the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) inexplicably told the magistrate that appellant was being prosecuted exclusively on count 1.  Consequently, the magistrate arraigned appellant only on that count.  He pled not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four months later, appellant, through counsel, negotiated a non-binding plea agreement with the government, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(A), under which he agreed to admit his guilt on count 1 and the government agreed to seek dismissal of the charge leveled against him in count 2.  In due course, the district court allowed appellant's change of plea.  In September 1992, the probation office compiled and delivered the presentence investigation report (PSI Report).  In December, after having been afforded an opportunity to scrutinize the PSI Report, appellant moved to withdraw his plea.  The district court denied the motion, primarily on the ground that appellant's asserted reasons lacked \"force and plausibility.\"   Soon thereafter, the court sentenced appellant on count 1 and dismissed count 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant now asserts that no consideration existed within the plea bargain to support the guilty plea, and, therefore, that he should have been allowed to withdraw it.  This assertion rests on two theses:  (1) that the AUSA indicated at arraignment that count 2 did not involve appellant;  and (2) that the two counts were, in all events, multiplicitous, and, consequently, pleading guilty to one count effectively disposed of the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first set in place the framework under which motions to withdraw pleas must be analyzed, and then turn to the specifics of appellant's asseverational array.A. The Framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial judges are the judiciary's infantry:  they man the front lines and, therefore, possess special insight into the dynamics of the cases over which they preside.  In deference to that insight, we review the district court's decision to grant or deny a request to withdraw a guilty plea solely for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Doyle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596485\"><a href=\"/opinion/596485/united-states-v-clifford-a-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span>, 594 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v.

See United States v. Buckley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506591\"><a href=\"/opinion/506591/united-states-v-david-k-buckley-david-k-buckley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span>, 998 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rather, such a motion can be granted before sentencing only upon an affirmative showing of a \"fair and just reason.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d).  The devoir of persuasion as to the existence of such a reason rests with the defendant.  See United States v. Gonzalez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587586\"><a href=\"/opinion/587586/united-states-of-america-appellee-cross-appellant-v-jose-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></a></span>, 1100 (2d Cir.1992);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d) advisory committee's note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To gauge whether the asserted ground for withdrawal meets the Rule 32(d) standard, a court must look at the overall situation, most prominently (1) the plausibility of the reasons prompting the requested change of plea;  (2) the timing of the defendant's motion;  (3) the existence or nonexistence of an assertion of innocence;  and (4) whether, when viewed in light of emergent circumstances, the defendant's plea appropriately may be characterized as involuntary, in derogation of the requirements imposed by Fed.R.Crim.P. 11,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> or otherwise legally suspect.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 594;  Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1537.   And there is a final barrier that must be surmounted:  even if a defendant appears at first blush to meet the strictures of this four-part test, the nisi prius court still must evaluate the proposed plea withdrawal in relation to any demonstrable prejudice that will accrue to the government if the defendant is permitted to alter his stance.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 594;  Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1537.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>B. Applying the Framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We run the gauntlet of relevant factors, discussing them in sequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Plausibility of the Asserted Reasons.   A defendant bent on withdrawing a guilty plea ordinarily must demonstrate a plausible reason for doing so.  See United States v. Tilley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583578\"><a href=\"/opinion/583578/united-states-v-ronald-e-tilley/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.1992).  In this context, plausibility must rest on more than the defendant's second thoughts about some fact or point of law, see United States v. Nichols, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600803\"><a href=\"/opinion/600803/united-states-v-frank-christian-nichols-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1199</span></a></span>, 1203 (8th Cir.1993), or about the wisdom of his earlier decision, see United States v. Austin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571445\"><a href=\"/opinion/571445/united-states-v-michael-j-austin-united-states-v-michael-j-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span>, 787 (1st Cir.1991).  We do not think that either of appellant's proffered reasons can vault this hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Refined to bare essence, appellant's flagship claim is that, because the government did not intend to prosecute him under count 2, he received nothing of value in exchange for his plea to count 1.  This argument prescinds from a presentable premise:  after all, we frequently have said that plea agreements are contractual in nature.  See, e.g., United States v. Atwood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583334\"><a href=\"/opinion/583334/united-states-v-thomas-p-atwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 479 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Hogan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515175\"><a href=\"/opinion/515175/united-states-v-mark-hogan-and-patricia-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 389 (1st Cir.1988).  But this analogy can only be carried so far.  Any time a defendant pleads guilty, he receives some built-in benefits, cf., e.g., Corbitt v. New Jersey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109956\"><a href=\"/opinion/109956/corbitt-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 224 n. 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109956\"><a href=\"/opinion/109956/corbitt-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span> (1978) (discussing leniency usually accorded to defendants who plead guilty as opposed to those who stand trial);  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 (making available reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility), and so long as the government does not make a material misrepresentation, renege on a promise, or breach the plea agreement, see, e.g., Santobello v. New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108416\"><a href=\"/opinion/108416/santobello-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 262, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108416\"><a href=\"/opinion/108416/santobello-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span> (1971), we do not believe that any further consideration is essential to support a guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, appellant received the full benefit of his bargain in this case.  The indictment made manifest, and the plea agreement confirmed, the grand jury's decision to charge appellant with two crimes, not one.  Although appellant had not been arraigned on count 2, that was a matter of mere mechanics.  He could have been arraigned, and, ultimately, prosecuted, at virtually any time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Thus, count 2 remained a viable option and the dismissal of it benefitted appellant.  Accordingly, appellant's first asserted reason for seeking to withdraw his plea lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. As an alternative reason, appellant asserts that the dismissal of count 2 did not amount to valuable consideration because the two counts of the indictment in reality comprised a single charge.  This assertion mischaracterizes the components of the indictment and the relationship of the counts inter sese.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not dispute the basic proposition on which this assertion is founded.  Indeed, it is apodictic that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"   U.S. Const., amend.  V.  To this end, the Double Jeopardy Clause shields a defendant from a second prosecution for the same offense after either an acquittal or a conviction, and also shields a defendant from multiple punishments for the same offense.

Thomas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112303\"><a href=\"/opinion/112303/jones-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span>, 380-81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112303\"><a href=\"/opinion/112303/jones-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Count 1 of the indictment requires a showing that appellant, after having been convicted of a felony, transported or possessed the firearm discovered by the police.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1).  Count 2 requires a showing that Concepcion, rather than appellant, had been convicted of a prior felony, that Concepcion, rather than appellant, knowingly transported or possessed the firearm, and that appellant, rather than Concepcion, aided and abetted.  On the allegations contained in that count, appellant could not have been convicted under section 922(g)(1), but only under the separate aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2(a).  Plainly, then, the elements of the two offenses are distinct rather than identical.  Hence, there is no multiplicitousness.  See Colon-Osorio, 10 F.2d at 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Timing.   The timing of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is significant.  Delayed requests, even if made before sentencing, are generally regarded with disfavor.  See Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1541.   The rule of thumb is that the longer a defendant waits before moving to withdraw his plea, the more potency his motion must have in order to gain favorable consideration.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, appellant waited roughly six months before he moved to withdraw his plea.  And, moreover, his belated change of heart followed not long after the PSI Report--a document which contained, inter alia, information suggesting that a stiff sentence loomed--arrived at the court's doorstep.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In appellant's case, then, a simple chronology of events serves to cast a long shadow over the legitimacy of his professed reasons for seeking to change course.  Courts need not accept a defendant's explanations uncritically.  See generally United States v. O'Brien, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661452\"><a href=\"/opinion/661452/43-socsecrepser-489-medicaremedicaid-guide-p-42092-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 708 (1st Cir.1994) (reminding us that \"[t]here are limits to coincidence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Claim of Innocence.   In determining whether a proposed plea withdrawal is fair and just, a defendant's assertion of innocence may weight the scales in favor of withdrawal, and conversely, the absence of a claim of innocence weights the opposite pan of the scales.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596;  Kobrosky, 711 F.2d at 455.   Appellant derives no comfort from this tenet.  In his motion papers, he did not profess his innocence.  Thus, this factor cuts sharply against allowing appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Other Considerations.   Other considerations can, of course, influence whether a defendant should be allowed to withdraw a guilty plea.  Here, however, we discern no miscellaneous considerations that counsel in favor of permitting appellant to withdraw his plea.  To the contrary, the record discloses that appellant entered the plea voluntarily, with full knowledge of the terms of the plea agreement, see Austin, 948 F.2d at 787, and under circumstances wherein the plea evidenced an intentional relinquishment of a known right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, despite the AUSA's misstatement at arraignment, the key facts were at appellant's disposal from the very outset.  The indictment itself was crystal clear.  The plea agreement was pellucid in its description of the two counts.  Then, too, the court explained matters fully during the change-of-plea hearing and appellant assured the court that he understood both the agreement (which he had signed) and the consequences of the ensuing plea.  He also assured the court that he entered into the plea and the plea agreement of his own free will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  It is the policy of the law to hold litigants to their assurances.  As we wrote in an analogous case, \"[w]e will not permit a defendant to turn his back on his own representations to the court merely because it would suit his convenience to do so.\"  Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1539.   So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Given reasons for withdrawal that are lacking in plausibility, an extended time lapse between the original plea and the motion to withdraw, the absence of any assertion of innocence, the district court's scrupulous adherence to the dictates of Rule 11, and the totality of the attendant circumstances, we discern no hint of discretion abused in the court's refusal to permit appellant to withdraw his guilty plea.  To be blunt, appellant had no entitlement to a second bite of the fig--and we will not afford him one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record reflects that Concepcion had been driving the vehicle and that appellant had occupied the front passenger seat</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Three facets of Rule 11 are especially important in this respect.  Rule 11(c) prescribes, in exquisite detail, the advice that a court must give to a defendant who indicates a desire to enter a guilty plea.  Rule 11(d) prescribes a procedure for ensuring that any plea is voluntary in nature.  Rule 11(e) outlines a series of safeguards referable to plea agreements between accuser and accused</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To be sure, an overlong period of delay between indictment and arraignment might vitiate the prospects for future prosecution.  See U.S. Const. amend.  VI;  see also United States v. Mala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1061 (1st Cir.1993).  But the delay here, as of the time appellant negotiated the plea agreement, was not overly protracted.  And in any event, even an extraordinary period of delay in arraigning a defendant does not automatically annul an indictment, but merely serves, if and when raised, to trigger an analysis of relevant factors that eventually may lead to a dismissal of the charge.  See, e.g., Barker v. Wingo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 530, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2182</span></a></span>, 2192, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span> (1972);  Mala, 7 F.3d at 1062 n. 3</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The PSI Report not only suggested a guideline sentencing range of 188-235 months, but also indicated that grounds for an upward departure might exist.  Appellant filed his motion to withdraw shortly after having had an opportunity to examine the report</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Because appellant has utterly failed to present a fair and just reason for plea withdrawal, we need not discuss possible prejudice to the government.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596 n. 6;  Buckley, 847 F.2d at 998 n. 5</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
