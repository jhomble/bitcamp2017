Shortly  after the  Exxon\n                                                                 \n\nValdez struck a  reef off  the Alaskan coast  in 1989,  defendant\n      \n\nExxon Shipping Company adopted a new policy barring  any employee\n\nwho had  ever participated  in an alcohol  rehabilitation program\n\nfrom  holding designated jobs  within the  company.   Pursuant to\n\nthis policy, plaintiff Theodore  Ellenwood, who had no connection\n\nto  the Valdez incident, was  removed from his  position as chief\n              \n\nengineer  of  another Exxon  oil  tanker,  the Exxon  Wilmington.\n                                                                \n\nEllenwood   voluntarily  had   entered,   and  successfully   had\n\ncompleted,  a  month-long alcohol  rehabilitation program  a year\n\nbefore  the Valdez  accident.   Despite  his  concerns about  his\n                  \n\ndrinking,  Ellenwood never  had  had an  on-the-job problem  with\n\nalcohol.   A  psychiatrist who  examined Ellenwood  in connection\n\nwith  this case concluded,  in fact,  that he  had never  been an\n\nalcoholic.  See Tr. Vol. V, at 133.\n               \n\n     Relying primarily  on the company's previous  written policy\n\nthat \"[n]o employees with alcoholism will have their job security\n\nor  future opportunities jeopardized due to a request for help or\n\ninvolvement in  a rehabilitation effort,\" Ellenwood  and his wife\n\nbrought suit against  Exxon alleging tort and  contract claims as\n\nwell as violations of  state statutes prohibiting  discrimination\n\nagainst  the  handicapped.1    Ellenwood  ultimately  received  a\n\n                    \n\n     1 The complaint  set forth the  following causes of  action:\nbreach of  contract (Count  I); breach  of a  duty of good  faith\narising out of Exxon's use of confidential information concerning\nEllenwood's alcohol treatment as a basis  for removing him (Count\nII); estoppel arising out of Exxon's representations and promises\n(Count III); wrongful discharge in violation of the public policy\npromoting  responsible  treatment   of  alcoholism  (Count   IV);\n\n                               -3-\n\njudgment  for $677,648  on his  contract and  promissory estoppel\n\ncauses of action.\n\n     In  these appeals, both sides contend,  inter alia, that the\n                                                       \n\ndistrict court  committed legal error in  defining the actionable\n\ncounts.  Ellenwood claims the judge eliminated too many claims on\n\nvarious legal grounds, depriving  him of additional relief, while\n\nExxon  claims  that  the court  allowed  too  many  counts to  be\n\ntried.2   We affirm most  of the  court's rulings.   We conclude,\n\nhowever,  that the  district court  overestimated the  preemptive\n\neffects of admiralty law  and the Rehabilitation Act of  1973, 29\n\nU.S.C.     701-796, and, accordingly, we must remand for trial on\n\nEllenwood's state statutory claims of handicap discrimination.3\n\n                    \n\ndiscrimination against the handicapped  contrary to various state\nlaws (Count V); misrepresentation over the career consequences of\nseeking alcohol  treatment (Count VI); intentional  and negligent\ninfliction  of emotional  distress on  both Ellenwoods  in ending\nEllenwood's  career  and  disseminating confidential  information\nconcerning  his condition  (Counts VII  and VIII);  defamation in\nremoving  Ellenwood from  his position  as chief  engineer (Count\nIX);  invasion of privacy in  the manner in  which Exxon obtained\nthe  information about  Ellenwood's  treatment and  disclosed  it\n(Count  X); invasion of privacy  in placing Ellenwood  in a false\nlight (Count XI); invasion of privacy in publicizing confidential\ninformation  (Count  XII); Mrs.  Ellenwood's  loss  of consortium\n(Count XIII); and punitive damages (Count XIV).\n\n     2  This  court  granted   the  State  of  Maine  provisional\npermission to intervene on the issue of whether Ellenwood's claim\nbased on  the Maine Human Rights Act, 2A Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n5,    4571-72 (Supp. 1992), is preempted by federal law.\n\n     3 The  complaint referred to  statutes in Maine,  New Jersey\nand Texas,  and we offer  no view as  to the applicable law.   We\nnote, however, that the district court applied Texas law to Count\nXII  of the complaint, which alleged an invasion of privacy.  See\n                                                                 \nMemorandum of Decision, Oct. 28, 1991. \n\n                               -4-\n\n            I. Preemption and the Rehabilitation Act4\n                                                    \n\nA. Background\n             \n\n     Section 503 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29  U.S.C.  \n\n793, requires any  contract with the federal government in excess\n\nof  $2,500   to  include  a  provision   obligating  the  federal\n\ncontractor to \"take affirmative  action to employ and advance  in\n\nemployment qualified  individuals with  handicaps.\"  29  U.S.C.  \n\n793(a).  Any handicapped individual who believes a contractor has\n\nfailed  to comply with this  provision may file  a complaint with\n\nthe Department of Labor, which must conduct an investigation  and\n\ntake  appropriate  action.   29  U.S.C.    793(b).    Regulations\n\npromulgated pursuant  to   503 specify  a detailed administrative\n\nenforcement mechanism for its breach.  See 41 C.F.R.    60-741.1-\n                                          \n\n741.32  (1991).   The  Department's  Office  of Federal  Contract\n\nCompliance Programs  (OFCCP) is  empowered, for example,  to seek\n\ninjunctive relief in  court, terminate or  cancel a contract,  or\n\nbar  a contractor from receiving  future contracts.   41 C.F.R.  \n\n60-741.28(b)-(e)  (1991).  It also may seek such remedies as back\n\npay and reinstatement for affected employees.  See Dep't of Labor\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Texas Indus.,  Inc., 47 Fair  Empl. Prac.  Cas. (BNA)  18, 28\n                       \n\n(Dep't Labor 1988).  See Howard v. Uniroyal, Inc., 719 F.2d 1552,\n                                                 \n\n1559 (11th Cir. 1983) (detailing enforcement procedures).\n\n     In  a motion for summary judgment, Exxon, which is a federal\n\ncontractor,  argued   that     503  preempts   virtually  all  of\n\n                    \n\n     4 Our  review of the district  court's preemption decisions,\nwhich were rulings of law, is plenary.\n\n                               -5-\n\nEllenwood's  state   law  claims,5  and  that   Ellenwood's  only\n\nrecourse on matters related to his alcohol treatment is the claim\n\nhe has filed  with the OFCCP.   The  district court rejected this\n\ncontention,  finding  no  evidence  that  Congress  intended  the\n\nprovision  to eliminate  conventional  state law  claims such  as\n\nbreach of  contract, misrepresentation, defamation  or infliction\n\nof  emotional  distress,  because these  claims  \"are  in no  way\n\nrelated to the federal Rehabilitation Act, any affirmative action\n\nclause  in a  government contract,  or handicap  discrimination.\"\n\nSee Memorandum of Decision, Oct. 15, 1991, at 3.   The court also\n   \n\nruled, however, that   503 did preempt  Count V's direct claim of\n\ndiscrimination  on the basis of handicap  in violation of various\n\nstate statutes, and  Count IV's common law claim that Ellenwood's\n\ndischarge   violated  a   public  policy   promoting  responsible\n\ntreatment of alcoholism.\n\n     Neither party  is satisfied with this  Solomonic division of\n\nthe claims.   Accordingly, on  appeal, we are  asked to  consider\n\nboth Ellenwood's  claim that the  district court erred  in ruling\n\nthat    503  preempts  Counts  IV  and  V  and  Exxon's  contrary\n\nassertion  that the  district  court erred  in  finding that  the\n\nfederal  statute does  not  preempt the  contract and  promissory\n\nestoppel  claims on which Ellenwood received a jury verdict.  The\n\nState  of Maine joins  Ellenwood in arguing  that   503  does not\n\npreempt  a claim  of  handicap discrimination  brought under  its\n\n                    \n\n     5  According  to  Exxon,  only  Counts  X  and  XII  of  the\ncomplaint,  charging the  company  with obtaining  and disclosing\nprivate information, survived preemption.\n\n                               -6-\n\nHuman Rights Act, 2A Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5,   4571-72 (Supp.\n\n1992).   We take up each  plea for reversal in  turn, following a\n\nbrief review of the well established contours of preemption law.\n\nB. Preemption Principles\n                        \n\n     The preemption  doctrine is rooted in  the Supremacy Clause,\n\nwhich  invalidates  state  laws  that  \"interfere  with,  or  are\n\ncontrary to, the laws of congress.\"  Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9\n                                                     \n\nWheat.)  1, 211  (1824).   See also  Cipollone v.  Liggett Group,\n                                                                 \n\nInc.,  112 S.  Ct. 2608,  2617 (1992).   A  court's sole  task in\n    \n\ndetermining whether a state statute is preempted is to  ascertain\n\nwhether Congress  intended the federal  law to have  such effect.\n\nCalifornia  Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272,\n                                                  \n\n280 (1987);  Massachusetts Medical  Society v. Dukakis,  815 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n790, 791 (1st Cir.  1987).  Although Congress may  articulate its\n\nintent explicitly, see, e.g., Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n519,  532 (1977), it does not always  do so, and the challenge of\n\npreemption law is to  identify occurrences of implied preemption.\n\nPreemption by implication may take place in different ways.\n\n     First,  congressional intent  to  preempt state  law may  be\n\ninferred when  the scheme of  federal regulation in  a particular\n\narea is  sufficiently pervasive  and complex \"to  make reasonable\n\nthe  inference that  Congress  `left no  room' for  supplementary\n\nstate regulation,\"  California Federal Savings &amp;  Loan Ass'n, 479\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at 281 (quoting  Rice v. Santa Fe  Elevator Corp., 331  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n218, 230 (1947)); see also Dukakis, 815 F.2d at 791.   Second, in\n                                  \n\nareas where Congress has not entirely displaced state regulation,\n\n                               -7-\n\nstate  law will  be deemed  preempted to  the extent  it actually\n\nconflicts  with  federal law.    Such  a conflict  occurs  either\n\nbecause \"`compliance with both federal and state regulations is a\n\nphysical  impossibility,'. . . ,  or because the state law stands\n\n`as an obstacle to  the accomplishment and execution of  the full\n\npurposes and objectives of Congress.'\" California Federal Savings\n                                                                 \n\n&amp;  Loan Ass'n,  479 U.S. at  281 (quoting Florida  Lime &amp; Avocado\n                                                                 \n\nGrowers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S.  132, 142-143 (1963) and Hines v.\n                                                              \n\nDavidowitz,  312  U.S.  52, 67  (1941)).

The Supreme Court recently\n\nreiterated  the longstanding principle that \"`the historic police\n\npowers of the States  [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal\n\nAct unless that  [course is]  the clear and  manifest purpose  of\n\nCongress.'\"  Cipollone,  112 S.  Ct. at 2617  (quoting Rice,  331\n                                                           \n\nU.S. at 230).  Thus, the presumption is against  preemption.  Id.\n                                                                \n\nat 2618.\n\n     C.  Applying the Principles\n                                \n\n     1. State handicap discrimination statutes.\n                                              \n\n     Section   503  contains   no   express  language   regarding\n\npreemption.   Our task, therefore,  is to determine whether there\n\nare  other  indicia  of  Congressional  intent  to  render  state\n\ndiscrimination  laws  ineffectual  against  federal  contractors.\n\nExxon essentially makes a two-pronged argument.   First, it cites\n\nlegislative  history suggesting  that  Congress sought  a uniform\n\n                               -8-\n\nfederal remedy for violations of   503, which would be frustrated\n\nif contractors  additionally were subject to  varying state laws.\n\nThus, according to Exxon, Congress must have intended  to preempt\n\nstate provisions.\n\n     Second,  Exxon  suggests that  the  detailed  nature of  the\n\nadministrative  scheme  promulgated   under     503  demonstrates\n\nCongress's intent  to foreclose  other types of  remedies against\n\nfederal contractors.   Exxon  maintains that, while  Congress has\n\nnot  fully occupied  the field  of handicap  discrimination, with\n\nrespect  to federal  contractors,  it  has  \"`left no  room'  for\n\nsupplementary state  regulation,\"  California Federal  Savings  &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nLoan Ass'n, 479 U.S. at 281.\n          \n\n     In our  view, what  Exxon offers  as proof  of an intent  to\n\npreempt  falls short  of the  mark.   The legislative  history on\n\nwhich  the company  relies  is  a  single  passage  in  a  Senate\n\nCommittee Report relating to amendments to the Rehabilitation Act\n\nthat were  enacted a year  after the Act itself.   The amendments\n\nmade no  change in either  sections 503 or  504 of the  Act,6 but\n\nthe Senate Report commented:\n\n          It  is  intended  that  sections 503  and  504  be\n     administered  in  such  a  manner  that  a  consistent,\n     uniform,    and    effective   Federal    approach   to\n     discrimination   against   handicapped  persons   would\n     result.  Thus, Federal  agencies and departments should\n     cooperate in developing standards and policies so  that\n     there  is a  uniform,  consistent  Federal approach  to\n     these sections.\n\n                    \n\n     6  Section 504,  29 U.S.C.    794,  prohibits discrimination\nagainst the handicapped in  federally funded programs, the United\nStates Postal Service, and in Executive agencies.\n\n                               -9-\n\nS.  Rep. No.  1297,  93d  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  reprinted  in  1974\n                                                           \n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 6373, 6391.\n\n     Exxon  claims  this passage  demonstrates that  Congress was\n\nseeking  an  exclusive  approach  to  handicap discrimination  by\n\nfederal  contractors,  and  that,  consequently,  it  must   have\n\nintended   503 to displace parallel state laws governing the same\n\nconduct.  Even without regard for the lesser weight accorded this\n\nsubsequent   history  than  would   be  accorded  contemporaneous\n\nlegislative comments,  see Heckler v.  Turner, 470 U.S.  184, 209\n                                             \n\n(1985), we believe  Exxon has read far  too much into  the quoted\n\nremarks.\n\n     We are persuaded that the passage in no way implicates state\n\nlaw but  instead reflects  Congress's concern  about the lack  of\n\ncoordination  on  the  federal  level between  the  two  agencies\n                                     \n\nresponsible for  implementing sections 503  and 504.   The Senate\n\nReport continues from  the portion quoted  above to elaborate  on\n\nthe agencies' relationship:\n\n     The  Secretary of the  Department of Health, Education,\n     and Welfare, because of that Department's experience in\n     dealing   with   handicapped  persons   and   with  the\n     elimination  of discrimination  in other  areas, should\n     assume responsibility for coordinating the  section 504\n     enforcement  effort and for establishing a coordinating\n     mechanism with the Secretary of the Department of Labor\n     to  ensure a consistent  approach to the implementation\n     of sections 503 and 504. \n\nS.  Rep.  No.  1297, 93rd  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  reprinted in  1974\n                                                           \n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 6373, 6391.  In our view, Congress was calling for a\n\nmore  uniform and consistent  \"Federal approach to discrimination\n                                      \n\nagainst handicapped  persons,\" id.

See D'Amato v. Wisconsin Gas Co., 760 F.2d 1474,\n                                                 \n\n1482 (7th Cir. 1985) (by insisting on coordination,  Congress was\n\ndirecting  \"that the two responsible agencies were not to work at\n\ncross purposes  or to duplicate each  other's efforts\") (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n     Exxon's second basis for  inferring an intent to  preempt --\n\nthe comprehensive  and detailed  regulations promulgated  under  \n\n503  --  is  equally unavailing.    The  fact  that Congress  has\n\nimplemented an  extensive regulatory scheme in  a particular area\n\ndoes not lead necessarily  to the conclusion that it  intended to\n\ndisplace parallel state remedies.  As the Supreme Court stated in\n\nHillsborough  County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 707, 716-18 (1985):\n\n     To infer pre-emption whenever  [a federal agency] deals\n     with a problem comprehensively is  virtually tantamount\n     to  saying that  whenever a  federal agency  decides to\n     step into  a field, its regulations  will be exclusive.\n     Such  a rule  .  . .  would  be inconsistent  with  the\n     federal-state  balance embodied in our Supremacy Clause\n     jurisprudence.\n\nSee also R.J.  Reynolds Tobacco  Co. v. Durham  County, 479  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n130, 149 (1986) (preemption should not be inferred simply because\n\nfederal  agency's regulations  are comprehensive).    Exxon cites\n\nnothing  in the state provisions  that would make compliance with\n\nboth  state law  and  the  detailed     503  scheme  a  \"physical\n\nimpossibility,\" Florida  Avocado &amp; Lime Growers, 373 U.S. at 143,\n                                               \n\nand, in the absence of other evidence of preemptive intent, there\n\nis no basis for displacing the state law.\n\n                               -11-\n\n     In  accepting Exxon's  argument  that  Congress intended  to\n\npreempt  state  anti-discrimination   remedies  against   federal\n\ncontractors, the  district court relied entirely  on the analysis\n\nof the Eleventh  Circuit in  Howard v. Uniroyal,  Inc., 719  F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1552 (1983).  In Howard, the  plaintiff had alleged a claim under\n                       \n\nAlabama law as a third party beneficiary of the   503 affirmative\n\naction clause contained in contracts between his employer and the\n\nfederal government.\n\n     The Eleventh Circuit  rejected this  claim.    It held  that\n\nstate  contract remedies  could  not be  used  to enforce     503\n\nessentially for the reasons Exxon has offered to us in support of\n\nits  preemption  argument.    Emphasizing  the  Senate   Report's\n\nreference to federal uniformity  and the comprehensiveness of the\n\n   503   administrative  scheme,   the  Howard  court   found  it\n                                              \n\n\"reasonable to infer that Congress left no room in section 503(b)\n\nfor state contract  actions to supplement it,\" id. at  1559.  The\n                                                 \n\ncourt   concluded   that  allowing   the  plaintiff   to  broaden\n\nenforcement of  the affirmative action  clause by means  of state\n\nlaw  could frustrate  directly  the specific  scheme designed  by\n\nCongress, allowing  a private  claim through  the back  door that\n\ncouldn't come through the front door.\n\n     An inference of preemption  was further warranted, the court\n\nheld, because  Congress's substantial  interest in  enforcing the\n\naffirmative  action  clause  --  determining  appropriate  terms,\n\nconditions  and  remedies  --  was \"more  substantial\"  than  the\n\n                               -12-\n\nstate's  interest   in  providing   a  remedy  for   third  party\n\nbeneficiaries seeking to enforce the same clause.  Id. at 1561.\n                                                     \n\n     We believe Exxon and the district court have relied unwisely\n\non Howard, which  differs from  this case in  a crucial  respect.\n         \n\nThere, the  plaintiff sought to  use state  law to enforce    503\n\nitself;  the  court  ruled  that Congress  intended  the  federal\n\nadministrative  remedy  to  be  the  plaintiff's  sole  means  of\n\nenforcing  the   affirmative  action  clause.     Here,  however,\n\nEllenwood  is  seeking to  enforce  not    503,  but  independent\n\nobligations created by state anti-discrimination statutes.\n\n     The claim in this  case does not threaten the  uniformity of\n                                                              \n\nthe     503  system.     Rather,  the   issue  here  is  one   of\n\ncompatibility, specifically,  whether  there  is  any  basis  for\n             \n\ninferring  that  Congress  believed an  independent  state remedy\n\ncould not co-exist with the    503 system.  Howard is not helpful\n                                                  \n\nin  this  context.

These  comments,  although   referring  to\n\nadministering   agencies   rather   than   federal   contractors,\n\nnevertheless  suggest  that Congress  both acknowledged  the role\n\nplayed  by  states in  the  area of  handicap  discrimination and\n\nassumed that states might choose to provide  different -- greater\n\n--  protection than that afforded by the federal government.  See\n                                                                 \n\nRaytheon, 46 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas., at 1099.8\n        \n\n     Finally,  we  note  that,   in  the  recent  Americans  with\n\nDisabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.    12101-12213, which amended\n\nthe  Rehabilitation  Act  and  extended   remedies  for  handicap\n\ndiscrimination  against  many  more  private  employers, Congress\n\nstated  explicitly  that  the  legislation  did  not  \"limit  the\n\nremedies, rights, and procedures of any .  . . law of any State .\n\n. . or jurisdiction that provides greater or equal protection for\n\nthe rights  of individuals with disabilities than are afforded by\n\nthis chapter.\"     42 U.S.C.    12201(b).   While  this provision\n\nobviously  can have no effect on our view of Congressional intent\n\nin 1973,  it is  a particularly  pertinent example  of Congress's\n\nhistorical   practice  of   allowing  overlapping   remedies  for\n\nemployment discrimination.9\n\n                    \n\n     8 We ackowledge that this post-enactment legislative history\nis  of  less weight  than  contemporary  commentary,  but  it  is\nnevertheless of some significance.   See, e.g., Heckler, 470 U.S.\n                                                       \nat 209; Cannon v.  University of Chicago, 441 U.S.  677, 686-687,\n                                        \nn.7 (1979).  \n\n     9 The absence of a provision disclaiming preemption from the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973  does not demonstrate, in  the absence\nof  other  evidence,  an  intent  to  foreclose  state  remedies.\nBecause of its far more comprehensive reach, the ADA is likely to\nhave  appeared  more  preemptive  than  the  earlier  legisation.\n\n                               -15-\n\n     Exxon attempts  to distance this case from  the tradition of\n\noverlapping  remedies  in  two  ways.   First,  it  asserts  that\n\nCongress has a unique  interest in regulating federal contractors\n\nand,  second, it claims that  the area of handicap discrimination\n\nrequires an  extraordinary balancing of  competing interests that\n\ndistinguishes it from  other types of  employment discrimination,\n\nsuch  as those  involving race, gender  or age.   In the handicap\n\ndiscrimination   field,  Exxon  maintains,   the  possibility  of\n\nconflicting judgments is much greater because courts in different\n\njurisdictions could reach  widely disparate  conclusions on  such\n\nbasic  questions  as  what  constitutes a  \"handicap\"  and  which\n\nhandicapped persons are \"qualified\" to hold particular positions.\n\nRestricting individuals to their   503 remedy would ensure that a\n\nfederal  contractor doing business  in more than  one state would\n\nface uniform obligations nationwide.\n\n     We think it unlikely that Congress has a special interest in\n\nimmunizing   federal   contractors  from   obligations  otherwise\n\napplicable to them under state handicap  discrimination statutes.\n\nThese companies may do  only $2,500 in business with  the federal\n\ngovernment, with the bulk of their enterprise devoted to commerce\n\nwithin  a  single  state.    This  division  gives  the  state  a\n\nsubstantial interest  in protecting  the employment  interests of\n\nits  handicapped citizens.   The developing nature  of the issues\n\nraised in  the field  of handicap  discrimination  strikes us  as\n\n                    \n\nCongress evidently made the  sensible decision to avoid confusion\nby including an express provision.  \n\n                               -16-\n\ninsufficient  justification for  excusing  these  employers  from\n\nobligations imposed on others who differ only in that the federal\n\ngovernment is not one of their customers.\n\n     Moreover,  Exxon's  obligation  is  not  simply to  identify\n\nreasons why Congress might have departed from its usual practice,\n\nbut to demonstrate a reasonable basis for inferring that Congress\n\ndid, in fact, intend to make the federal remedy exclusive in this\n\nsingle  area of employment discrimination law.  Exxon has offered\n\nnothing from which we can discern such an intent. \n\n       In sum, we find no \"clear and manifest\" intent on the part\n\nof  Congress  to  preempt  state  handicap discrimination  claims\n\nagainst  federal contractors.  Indeed, we find no signals of such\n\nan intent.10\n\n     2. Contract and promissory estoppel.\n                                        \n\n     In its appeal, Exxon contends that the district court should\n\nhave extended its   503 preemption ruling to Ellenwood's contract\n\nand  promissory estoppel claims as  well.  Exxon  points out that\n\nthese claims  allege that  the company  breached an  agreement or\n\npromise  not   to  discriminate  on  the   basis  of  Ellenwood's\n\n\"handicap\"  of  alcohol  abuse.   Again  relying  solely  on  the\n\nuniformity rationale, Exxon argues that all state claims based on\n\nthe same  assertedly discriminatory  conduct are foreclosed  by  \n\n503.\n\n                    \n\n     10 Our  preemption analysis  applies as well  to Ellenwood's\nclaim for wrongful discharge based on public policy.  We offer no\nview,  however, as  to  whether such  a  claim exists  under  the\napplicable state law.\n\n                               -17-\n\n     Our ruling on the statutory claims also is dispositive here.\n\nWe note, however, one instance in which a contract claim based on\n\nstatements in a company policy manual may be  preempted by   503.\n\nRegulations  promulgated under the  statute require  employers to\n\npost  notices  of their  Rehabilitation  Act  obligations and  of\n\nemployee  rights under    503  in \"conspicuous  places.\"   See 41\n                                                              \n\nC.F.R.   60-741.4(d).  If  an employer included such a  notice in\n\nits  policy manual solely to comply with this regulation, a state\n\ncontract claim based on a breach of the manual provision arguably\n\nwould be preempted by the federal law.  See Arellano v. Amax Coal\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 56 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA)  1519, 1524-25 (D. Wy. 1991).\n   \n\nSuch a  claim, though in the  guise of a contract  claim based on\n\nthe manual, would seem no different from one directly asserting a\n\nbreach of   503.  A direct claim under   503 unquestionably would\n\nbe preempted for the reasons set out in Howard.\n                                              \n\n     Exxon does not  contend that  the statements  at issue  here\n\nwere  required by     503.   Indeed, such  a contention  would be\n\npatently unsupportable.  Ellenwood's contract and estoppel claims\n\nare  not  premised on  a  general notice  of  Exxon's affirmative\n\naction obligations toward handicapped  individuals, but on a very\n\nspecific written  assurance from the  company that  it would  not\n\ndisadvantage employees for seeking treatment for alcoholism.\n\n     We  therefore   hold  that  the  district   court  correctly\n\ndetermined that Ellenwood's contract and estoppel claims were not\n\npreempted by   503.\n\n                               -18-\n\n                  II. The Role of Admiralty Law\n                                               \n\n     Our conclusion that   503 does not preempt Ellenwood's state\n\nstatutory and common  law claims  does not end  our inquiry  into\n\nwhether those claims are  foreclosed by federal law.

Congress's  only   legislation  in  the   area  of\n\nhandicapped rights  has not been directed at  maritime cases and,\n\nas  discussed  supra,  its  legislation  did  not  preempt  state\n                    \n\nremedies.  We find no indications that the absence of substantive\n\nmaritime  law  governing   issues  concerning  individuals   with\n\nhandicaps  reflects a  federal  interest  in protecting  maritime\n\nemployers from such obligations.   See 1 Benedict on  Admiralty  \n                                                               \n\n112,  at  7-37.

Maritime law  historically has\n\nappreciated  the  leading  role  of state  statutes  in  creating\n\nadditional  bases of recovery.  In maritime wrongful death cases,\n\nfor example, remedies first were provided solely under state law.\n\nSee Miles, 111  S. Ct. at 320-23; Moragne v. States Marine Lines,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 398 U.S. 375,  397 (1970).

State statutes continued to  play a primary role\n\nfor  another  fifty  years, until  the  Supreme  Court  created a\n\ngeneral  maritime cause of action for wrongful death.  See Miles,\n                                                                \n\n111 S.

The  State emphasizes,  however, that  under its\n\nlaw, any legitimate physical  requirements for crew members under\n\n                    \n\n     12 Even  today, plaintiffs  may invoke state  wrongful death\nstatutes  under  the  saving   clause  insofar  as  they  involve\naccidents  in  territorial waters  and do  not conflict  with the\nsubstantive  principles  developed  under the  maritime  wrongful\ndeath  doctrine.  See Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477\n                                                            \nU.S. 207, 227 (1986).\n\n                               -23-\n\nthe   seaworthiness   doctrine   would   constitute   bona   fide\n\noccupational requirements that would  provide a defense to claims\n\nbrought under the statute.

Of course,  whether  or not  a  state's\n\nstatute specifically included such a defensive provision,  vessel\n\nowners obviously could not be held liable for damages under state\n\nanti-discrimination   laws   when  federal   maritime  principles\n\nrequired the employer to  make the contested employment decision.\n\nIn that narrow way, maritime law would be preemptive.\n\n     As a  general matter, however, we conclude  that state human\n\nrights statutes may  be applied  in maritime cases.   Indeed,  it\n\nwould  be anomalous for maritime  law, which has  always shown \"a\n\nspecial solicitude for the welfare of seamen and their families,\"\n\nMiles,  111 S.

According to\n\nExxon,  maritime  law  has  \"clung tenaciously\"  to  the  at-will\n\nprinciple,  and only  one  narrow exception  previously has  been\n\ncarved from it.  In Atlas Off-Shore Boat Serv., 653 F.2d at 1062-\n                                              \n\n63, the court  permitted a  claim for wrongful  discharge when  a\n\nseaman was fired for filing a  personal injury claim that he  was\n\nentitled  to file by statute.  No additional exceptions should be\n\nallowed  to erode  the  strength of  the at-will  doctrine, Exxon\n\nargues, since the seaman's rights as an employee already are well\n\nprotected  by federal statute.  See generally, e.g., 46 U.S.C.   \n                                                   \n\n10302,  10303, 10313,  10502,  10504,  10505, 10506  (prescribing\n\nprocedures governing meals, hours and wages for seamen).\n\n     Exxon misperceives  the district court's ruling.   The court\n\ndid  not devise  a new  \"wrongful discharge\"  cause of  action on\n\nbehalf  of Ellenwood.  It simply recognized the obvious fact that\n\n-- notwithstanding the general rule that a seaman's employment is\n\nat-will  -- a maritime employer may  make a contractual agreement\n\nwith, or an enforceable promise to, its employees.\n\n     In this case, Ellenwood claimed that Exxon had promised that\n\nhis  job   security  and   future  opportunities  would   not  be\n\njeopardized  if  he sought  treatment for  alcoholism.   The jury\n\nfound that the requirements for establishing a binding obligation\n\n                               -25-\n\nwere  met.  We  see no reason  why maritime law  would invalidate\n\nthis self-imposed obligation.13\n\n     Accordingly, we affirm the  district court's judgment on the\n\nbreach of contract and estoppel claims.  See infra Section V.\n                                                  \n\n         III.

The district  court overturned these  verdicts on the\n\nground that  maritime plaintiffs may not  recover for negligently\n\ncaused  emotional  damages unless  they  demonstrate accompanying\n\nphysical  injury  or  impact.14    The  Ellenwoods  presented  no\n\nevidence of physical harm.\n\n     In  granting  judgment for  defendants,  the district  court\n\nnoted that the Supreme Court in Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Ry.\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     13 Exxon does not  argue that the district  court improperly\ninstructed  the jury  on  the elements  necessary to  establish a\ncontract or promissory estoppel claim in these circumstances, and\nwe therefore do not delve into this issue.  See, e.g., Pearson v.\n                                                              \nJohn Hancock Mutual  Life Ins.  Co., No. 92-1684,  slip op.  (1st\n                                   \nCir.

See\n                                                                 \nRestatement (Second) of Contracts   33 (1981).

Exxon does  not --  and, in  our view, cannot\nreasonably -- argue that its policy statement assuring no adverse\nconsequences  based  on  alcoholism  treatment  is insufficiently\ndefinite to support a contract or estoppel claim.\n\n     14 The court very prudently allowed  the claims to go to the\njury,  thus   foreclosing  the  possibility  of   a  later  heavy\ninvestment of time and expense in the event that it should render\na  judgment  notwithstanding  the   verdict  and  that  we  would\ndisagree.\n\n                               -26-\n\nCo.   v.

Co., 823 F.2d 693, 694 (1st  Cir. 1987)\n                             \n\n(declining  to  consider   physical  injury  requirement  because\n\nplaintiff  failed to show causation).  It therefore relied on our\n\ndecision in Bullard  v. Central  Vermont Ry., 565  F.2d 193,  197\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1977), to hold that a physical injury is a prerequisite\n\nfor recovery of emotional distress damages.16\n\n     In  the aftermath  of Buell,  recovery for  wholly emotional\n                                \n\ninjury under the Jones Act and FELA has become an \"important  and\n\nrecurring issue\" of federal law.

Ct. 914  (1992) (White,  J.,  dissenting from  denial of\n\ncertiorari).17   The circuits  vary in  their  treatment of  such\n\nclaims.  See, e.g., Ray v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 938 F.2d 704,\n                                                  \n\n705 (7th Cir. 1991) (no recovery under FELA unless injury results\n\n                    \n\n     15  Buell  involved  a   claim  brought  under  the  Federal\n              \nEmployers Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C.    51-60, which creates\na negligence cause  of action for railroad  workers against their\nemployers.  The Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. App.   688, creates the same\ncause of  action for seamen,  and incorporates  by reference  the\nFELA.

As the Supreme Court noted in Buell,\n                                                                \n\nstate court decisions reveal  a number of \"doctrinal divergences\"\n\nconcerning  intentional and  negligent  infliction  of  emotional\n\ndistress.

The Court  therefore theorized  that\n             \n\nrecovery  for emotional injury \"might rest on a variety of subtle\n\nand intricate distinctions  related to the  nature of the  injury\n\nand  the character of  the tortious activity.\"   Id. at  568.

Subsequently,  in an  en banc  ruling, the  circuit\n                                           \naffirmed  the denial of recovery but withdrew the broad ruling of\nlaw.   966 F.2d 166 (1992).  The Supreme Court denied certiorari.\nSee 61 U.S.L.W. 3400 (U.S. Nov. 30, 1992). \n   \n\n                               -28-\n\nconcluded its discussion by cautioning that, in this area of law,\n\n\"broad  pronouncements  . .  . may  have  to bow  to  the precise\n\napplication  of  developing legal  principles  to  the particular\n\nfacts at hand.\"  Id. at 570.\n                   \n\n     Because the  Ellenwoods have failed to  present their claims\n\nof negligence with particularity, this is not an appropriate case\n\nin which to undertake such a substantial inquiry.  Counts VII and\n\nVIII  of the  complaint,  in the  words  of the  district  court,\n\nalleged  \"intentional  and   negligent  infliction  of  emotional\n\ndistress  on both  Mr. and Mrs.  Ellenwood in  ending Ellenwood's\n\ncareer and disseminating confidential information  concerning his\n\ncondition.\"    Memorandum  of  Decision,  Oct.  15,  1991, at  2.\n\nNeither  the  complaint  nor  the  Ellenwoods'  briefs,  however,\n\nspecifically  identifies the  negligent  acts  of  commission  or\n\nomission.19   In closing  argument, plaintiffs'  counsel referred\n\nin one sentence, in conclusory terms, to the negligent infliction\n\nclaim.20  \n\n                    \n\n     19 For  example,  was the  alleged  breach of  contract  the\nasserted negligent action?  Or was it the manner in which the new\npolicy  was devised?  or  communicated?  or  applied?    Was  the\ndisclosure of  Ted Ellenwood's  alcohol treatment negligent?   If\nso,  how?   Instead  of  specifically  identifying the  allegedly\nunreasonable  conduct   that  constituted   a  breach  of   duty,\nplaintiffs apparently  assumed that we could,  and would, discern\nfrom  the underlying facts one or more bases for their negligence\nclaims.  This approach dates back to plaintiffs' complaint, where\nthey  simply incorporated  by  reference  the factual  background\nunderlying the  other causes of action to  support the negligence\nclaims.  See Complaint at    88-90.\n            \n\n     20 Following lengthy discussions of the contract, promissory\nestoppel and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims,\ncounsel stated:\n\n                               -29-\n\n     The  lack  of attention  devoted  to this  claim  is further\n\nillustrated   by  plaintiffs'  assertion   that  Ted  Ellenwood's\n\nnegligence  cause of  action was  brought under  general maritime\n\nlaw, not the Jones Act.  See, e.g., Tr. Vol. XII, at 7.  In fact,\n                                  \n\nthe Jones Act provides the  exclusive recovery in negligence  for\n\nclaims  by seamen  against their  employers.   See Miles  v. Apex\n                                                                 \n\nMarine,  111 S.

I feel,\n     however, very  strongly that intentional  infliction of\n     emotional distress  has  been  shown  because  of  this\n     policy itself and  the actions  Exxon Shipping  Company\n     took against  him deliberately  after this policy  came\n     into effect.\n\nTr. Vol. XI, at 98.\n\n     The court's  instructions on the negligence  count also were\nframed broadly.  The  court told the jury that the plaintiff must\nprove that  (1) Exxon  acted or  failed to  act as  \"a reasonably\nprudent corporation would act in the  management of its affairs;\"\n(2)   that  \"severe   emotional  distress\"   to  plaintiffs   was\nforeseeable;  and (3) that plaintiffs suffered such distress as a\nresult of negligence.  See Tr. Vol. XI, at 47.\n                          \n\n                               -30-\n\nEllenwood's general  maritime cause of action  could be dismissed\n\nfor that reason alone.21\n\n     The Supreme Court in Buell only speculated that  some claims\n                               \n\nfor purely emotional injury  may be brought under the  FELA.  See\n                                                                 \n\nMoody, 823 F.2d at  694 (door to recovery only  \"somewhat ajar\").\n     \n\nConducting the  particularized review  needed to evaluate  such a\n\nclaim  here  would  require  a detailed  examination  of  Exxon's\n\nassertedly  negligent conduct, its context, and its impact on the\n\nEllenwoods.   Arguably,  even  in a  routine  case, it  would  be\n\ninappropriate  for us to construct a theory of negligence so that\n\nwe could analyze a  claim of apparently little importance  to the\n\nplaintiffs.  A  fortiori, we would be ill-advised  to do so here,\n                        \n\nwhere we  are asked  to take  a precedential  step with a  highly\n\ncircumscribed license from the Supreme Court.22\n\n                    \n\n     21  Although  Mrs. Ellenwood's  claim  arises  under general\nmaritime law, the  limitations on recovery contained in the Jones\nAct  nonetheless  are relevant  because  her  claim is  based  on\nassertedly  negligent  conduct  governed  by the  statute.    See\n                                                                 \ngenerally Miles  v. Apex Marine, 111  S. Ct. at 327  (\"We sail in\n                               \noccupied waters.

Additionally,\nwe question whether a case such as this,  whose dominant claim is\nthat the  defendant intentionally reneged on  a promise, presents\nthe sort of tortious conduct properly compensable under the Jones\nAct.\n\n                               -31-\n\n     We  decline  to  explore  the  frontiers  of  the  negligent\n\ninfliction  tort  in  these   circumstances.

M/S Scotia\n                                                                 \n\nPrince, 845 F.2d  347, 354 (1st  Cir. 1988) (maritime  standard).\n      \n\nAnd  so,   plaintiffs  contend   that  the  rejection   of  their\n\nintentional  tort claims  is not  fatal to  an award  of punitive\n\ndamages.\n\n     Assuming that maritime law would  permit a limited role  for\n\npunitive damages in the  contract setting -- an  issue we do  not\n\nreach -- we  think it  inconceivable that such  damages would  be\n\navailable  when the  jury  specifically has  rejected plaintiffs'\n\n                               -34-\n\naccompanying  intentional tort  claims.   Thus, even  if punitive\n\ndamages may be awarded  under maritime tort law based  on conduct\n                                           \n\nthat would not satisfy the standard for intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress, we decline  to hold that they may  be awarded\n\nfor breach of contract in these circumstances.\n                      \n\n     Whether punitive damages  may be available  should Ellenwood\n\nprevail upon remand on  the handicap discrimination claims  is an\n\nissue  not  before us  today.   At the  moment  this is  solely a\n\ncontract  case,  and  we  adhere  to  the  settled  rule  of  law\n\nprohibiting such an award.\n\n                        V. Burden of Proof\n                                          \n\n     Exxon attempted  to prove at  trial that, even  if Ellenwood\n\nhad  not been  removed from  his chief  engineer's post  in April\n\n1989,  he would have  lost his job  later in the  year when Exxon\n\ndownsized its  fleet.   Consequently, because Exxon  continued to\n\npay Ellenwood's  full salary  and benefits through  January 1991,\n\nthe company argued that Ellenwood was not entitled to any damages\n\nfor breach of contract or promise.\n\n     On appeal, Exxon claims  that the district court incorrectly\n\ninstructed the jury that  the company bore the burden  of proving\n\nthat  Ellenwood would have been terminated  for bona fide reasons\n                                                         \n\nunrelated  to the new alcohol  rehabilitation policy.  The burden\n\nshould have been placed on the plaintiff, Exxon asserts, and this\n\nerror entitles the  company, at a minimum, to a  new trial on the\n\ncontract and estoppel claims.  \n\n                               -35-\n\n     We  find it unnecessary to consider this issue on the merits\n\nbecause we conclude  that Exxon  failed to preserve  it.  At  two\n\nseparate  times, once before the  jury charge and  once after it,\n\nthe court and  counsel discussed the instruction on this defense.\n\nOn the first occasion, during the precharge conference, the court\n\nannounced its decision to  impose the burden on the  defendant to\n\nprove  that  Ellenwood would  have lost  his job  for independent\n\nreasons, and  twice  repeated  its  intention  to  give  such  an\n\ninstruction.  See Tr. Vol. XI, at 24, 28, 29.\n                 \n\n     At  that  time,  Exxon  responded  by  asking  the  court to\n\ninclude,  within the  \"independent reasons\"  portion of  the jury\n\ncharge,  a sentence  about  \"business judgment.\"   This  addition\n\nwould have emphasized  to the jury  that, in considering  whether\n\nEllenwood would have been  terminated as a result of  the fleet's\n\ndownsizing, it was not permitted to second-guess Exxon's business\n\njudgment  in devising and applying  its ranking system.   See Tr.\n                                                             \n\nVol.  XI, at  26.   The  ensuing  discussion  focused on  how  to\n\ncommunicate  to the jury that its task was limited to determining\n\nwhether  the ranking  system  was  a  pretext.   The  instruction\n\nultimately adopted  by the  court included language  suggested by\n\nExxon's counsel.   Id. at 29.  At no  time during this discussion\n                     \n\ndid counsel object to the court's imposing the burden on Exxon.\n\n     Subsequently, the  district court  instructed the  jury that\n\n\"Exxon Shipping  has the  burden of  proof to  show you that  Mr.\n\nEllenwood would have lost  his job for independent, nonpretextual\n\nreasons,\" see Tr. Vol. XI,  at 51.  Following the full  charge on\n             \n\n                               -36-\n\nall claims, the district court held a sidebar conference in which\n\nit heard and responded  to both sides' objections.  At that time,\n\nExxon's counsel requested an \"additional  instruction\" on damages\n\nfor breach of contract or promise.\n\n     The  proposed  addition  consumes  43  lines  in  the  trial\n\ntranscript.   See  Tr.  Vol. XI,  at  64-66.25   The  first  four\n                 \n\nparagraphs  contained essentially  the  instruction  on  business\n\njudgment that  Exxon had requested earlier.   See Tr. Vol. XI, at\n                                                 \n\n65 (\"You may not consider whether in your opinion the evaluations\n\nor  the rankings  are appropriate  or were  done in a  manner you\n\nagree with.).   The next  section opens with  the assertion  that\n\n\"[t]he  sole  question  you  are  to  consider  is whether  Exxon\n\nShipping  maintained its  employee ranking  list in  good faith,\"\n\nid., and then states that, in deciding  the question, \"plaintiffs\n  \n\nhave  the  burden of  proof.\"    Id.   The  proposal  goes on  to\n                                   \n\nelaborate  on  the  plaintiff's  burden,  i.e.,  to  show  \"by  a\n\npreponderance of the evidence  that Exxon Shipping manipulated or\n\notherwise misused its ranking procedure in bad faith to cause Mr.\n\nEllenwood  to  be  ranked lower  on  the  ranking  list of  chief\n\nengineers than he otherwise would have been.\"  Id. at 65-66.\n                                                 \n\n     The district  court gave  the following response  to Exxon's\n\nproposal:\n\n          So far as the requested lengthy instruction  . . .\n     by  the defendant involving rank, proximate cause, good\n     faith, management  practices and so on,  I am satisfied\n     that  would involve me in too great a commentary on the\n\n                    \n\n     25 The  requested instruction is reproduced  in its entirety\nin an appendix to this opinion.\n\n                               -37-\n\n     evidence.    Instead,  I've   given  a  general  charge\n     concerning the  issue of whether  Exxon would otherwise\n     have terminated him, required  only that its reasons be\n     independent and  not pretextual.   I believe  that that\n     adequately meets the standards in this area.\n\nTr.  Vol. XI, at 72.  It  appears that the district court focused\n\nprimarily,  if not exclusively,  on the first  portion of Exxon's\n\nlengthy request  and concluded  that its own  pretext instruction\n\nadequately met Exxon's  concern that  the jury  not consider  how\n\ngood the  ranking system was but only whether it was used in good\n\nfaith.  Exxon  made no further  response and did  not inform  the\n\ncourt that it also was concerned about who had the burden on this\n\nissue.\n\n     What Exxon did  here was not enough to  entitle it to assert\n\nthis issue on appeal as a basis for a new trial.  Counsel did not\n\nobject  to the court's  burden instruction, but  proposed only an\n\naddition.   The  proposal was  long and,  in its  latter portion,\n\ncontradicted the court's earlier instruction on burden.  When the\n\ncourt reacted with comments apparently directed only to the first\n\npart of the  proposal, counsel  made no effort  to highlight  its\n\nconcern  regarding the  burden.   This  omission is  particularly\n\nsignificant  in light  of the  earlier discussion,  which focused\n\nsolely on the business judgment rule.  \n\n     Similarly, in its post-trial  memorandum seeking a new trial\n\non the contract and estoppel claims, under  the heading \"Employee\n\nRankings,\" Exxon argued only  that the court erred \"in  declining\n\nto instruct the jury that it could not  second guess the business\n\njudgment  of  Exxon  Shipping  with respect  to  its  performance\n\n                               -38-\n\nevaluations and employee ranking system.\"  See Memorandum, at  9.\n                                              \n\nAgain, no reference was made to the burden of proof.\n\n     Not until  its reply brief  on appeal  did Exxon  articulate\n\nclearly  and concisely its burden of proof objection.  It is well\n\nestablished, the company now contends, that the burden of proving\n\nbad  faith must  be  on the  party  seeking  to show  it  because\n\n\"[d]isproving bad  faith is  almost always close  to impossible.\"\n\nReply Brief, at 17.   Because the issue here was not  the quality\n\nof Exxon's ranking system, but  whether the system was maintained\n\nin good faith,  the company claims the burden should have been on\n\nEllenwood to  prove that  Exxon manipulated  its rankings  in bad\n\nfaith.\n\n     We do  not reach this argument  because it is too  late.  To\n\nconsider  disassembling  the  court and  jury's  substantial work\n\nwithout clearer  notice than  Exxon gave  to  the district  court\n\nwould be to  snub the requirement  in Fed. R.  Civ. P. 51 that  a\n\nparty must  \"stat[e] distinctly  the matter objected  to and  the\n\ngrounds  of objection.\"   Accordingly,  we leave  undisturbed the\n\ndistrict court's judgment on the contract and estoppel claims.\n\n                       VI. Benefits Offset\n                                          \n\n     Exxon has claimed error  in the district court's instruction\n\nto the  jury not to  offset the  damages award by  the amount  of\n\nspecial retirement benefits the  company has paid or will  pay to\n\nEllenwood.  Under a \"special sea service plan,\" Exxon contributed\n\nto  an  annuity  that  distributed monthly  payments  to  retired\n\n                               -39-\n\nemployees in  amounts based on life expectancy.   Ellenwood began\n\nreceiving annuity payments of nearly $20,000 a year following his\n\nretirement in  1991 at age 45.   It is these  payments that Exxon\n\nseeks to have offset.\n\n     Exxon's argument is based on  the general principle that  an\n\naward of  lost earnings makes the  wrongfully discharged employee\n\nwhole and  that to add pension benefits would give the employee a\n\nwindfall.   Ellenwood  counters with  his own  windfall argument:\n\nsubtracting the  expected benefits from the  damages award treats\n\nthe employer who breaches  an employment contract more charitably\n\nthan  one who  has observed  one faithfully.   Both  parties cite\n\ncaselaw to support their claims.\n\n     In fact, however, we  conclude that the record made  in this\n\ncase, rather than general principles,  dictates the result.   The\n\nrelevant facts are contained  in a letter from an  Exxon official\n\nin  response  to a  request from  Ellenwood's counsel  to provide\n\n\"[t]he  1990  percentages of  payroll  for  the various  benefits\n\nprovided  to  employees.\"    Brief  of   Plaintiffs-Appellees  at\n\nAddendum  18.   The  letter, which  is  not mentioned  in Exxon's\n\nbrief, itemized  the percentages of payroll  attributable to life\n\ninsurance, medical and dental insurance, Medicare, a thrift plan,\n\nlong term  disability insurance, workers' compensation,  and \"all\n\nother.\"  These items totalled 20.8%  But included in the listing,\n\nindeed  heading  the  list,  was \"Annuity\"  and  its  percentage,\n\n\"(2.7%)\".   In other words, this percentage was deducted from the\n\n                               -40-\n\ntotal of the  above listed  items, making the  bottom line  total\n\npercentage for fringe benefits 18.1%.\n\n     The effect  of this listing  was to indicate  to Ellenwood's\n\neconomic  expert on damages that he should add to his computation\n\nof lost earnings 18.1% of those earnings  to reflect compensation\n\nin  the form  of fringe  benefits.   Exxon did  not add  into the\n\nbenefits  total the 2.7% annuity  item, which would  amount to an\n\nannual  payment  of approximately  $2,300.    Indeed, the  letter\n\nsubtracted the 2.7% from the remaining total of benefits, thereby\n\nreducing by a substantial amount the present discounted value  of\n\nEllenwood's fringe benefits.\n\n     Had there  been no breach  of the  employment contract,  the\n\n$2,300  yearly  contribution  apparently  would  have  bought  an\n\nannuity that, upon Ellenwood's retirement  at age 65, would  have\n\nyielded annual payments in an amount much larger than the present\n\n$20,000 amount.   We look upon this amount as  having been bought\n\nby prior Exxon contributions  and earned by Ellenwood as  part of\n\nExxon's compensation package.  To allow Exxon a further deduction\n\nfor the  income stream  purchased  by the  annual $2,300  payment\n\nwould seem to be, as Ellenwood argues, to allow a double credit.\n\n     This,  at least, is how we read the testimony of plaintiff's\n\neconomist,  Dr. McCausland,  who  had asked  for the  percentages\n\napplicable to fringe benefits.  He testified that\n\n     the  fringe benefit  [sic] had  to be put  into present\n     value terms . . . , it's how many dollars do we have to\n     give  him  today so  he'll  have that  amount  of money\n     available  to  him in  each year  to  pay for  the same\n     fringe benefits.\n\n                               -41-\n\n          And I based it on their fringe benefit package . .\n     . .  And what I did, I took 18.1 percent of the present\n     value  of  lost earnings,  and  that  works out  to  be\n     $294,528.79.\n\nTr. Vol. V, at 111.  On cross examination Exxon's  counsel asked,\n\n\"Now you were also  aware that Mr. Ellenwood is  receiving almost\n\n$20,000 a year in pension benefits currently from Exxon  Shipping\n\nCompany?\"  To this, Ellenwood's counsel objected, saying, \"that's\n\nhis money, and it  is not properly considered to  be mitigation.\"\n\nWhereupon Exxon's counsel withdrew the question.  Id. at 121-122.\n                                                    \n\n     On this record  the district  court ruled that  it was  \"the\n\nburden of  proof of the defendant  to come forward and  show that\n\nthese are benefits being received that  should be subtracted from\n\nthe amounts that  plaintiff would  otherwise . .  . receive\"  and\n\nthat \"the state of the record doesn't permit that determination.\"\n\nTr. Vol. XI, at 35.   We agree.  Indeed, it seems to  us that the\n\nrecord  is not merely insufficient to support a basis for offset,\n\nbut points affirmatively to an already accomplished deduction.\n\n                         VII. Conclusion\n                                        \n\n     The following is a brief summary of our major holdings:\n\n     (1)    we reverse  the  district court's  ruling  that state\n\nstatutes  prohibiting discrimination against  the handicapped are\n\npreempted  by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and maritime law, as\n\nwell as its ruling  that plaintiff's claim of violation  of state\n\npublic policy is  similarly preempted, and the  case therefore is\n\nremanded for further proceedings on such claims;\n\n                               -42-\n\n     (2) we  affirm the district court's  ruling that Ellenwood's\n\nstate contract  and promissory estoppel claims  are not preempted\n\nby either the Rehabilitation Act or maritime law;\n\n     (3) we  decline to  address the  Ellenwoods' claim that  the\n\ndistrict court improperly granted Exxon's request for judgment as\n\na  matter  of law  on their  claims  for negligent  infliction of\n\nemotional  distress,   concluding  that  these  claims  were  not\n\nadequately developed;\n\n     (4) we  affirm the  district court's  refusal to  submit the\n\nissue of punitive damages to the jury;\n\n     (5) we find that  Exxon failed to preserve its  challenge to\n\nthe  district court's instruction imposing upon  it the burden of\n\ndemonstrating  that Ellenwood  would have  been removed  from his\n\nchief engineer's  position  in late  1989 for  bona fide  reasons\n                                                        \n\nindependent  of his  participation in  an alcohol  rehabilitation\n\nprogram;\n\n     (6) and we  affirm the district court's decision  to exclude\n\nfrom  the  jury's  damages  calculation  Ellenwood's sea  service\n\nretirement benefits.26\n\n     The judgment of the district  court is therefore affirmed in\n                                                                 \n\npart,  reversed in  part,  and remanded  for further  proceedings\n                                                                 \n\nconsistent with this opinion.  No costs. \n                                       \n\n                    \n\n     26  We  have  reviewed   the  district  court's  rulings  on\nEllenwood's privacy claims, and find no error. \n\n                               -43-\n\n                             APPENDIX\n\nThe following  is the full  text of  Exxon's proposed  additional\n\ninstruction  on damages  for breach  of contract  or  promise, as\n\ndiscussed supra at page 36.\n               \n\n     As you  know, Mr.  Ellenwood ceased receiving  a salary\n     from Exxon Shipping on  January 15, 1991.  If  you find\n     as Exxon Shipping claims  that Mr. Ellenwood would have\n     been  terminated prior to that time in the fall of 1989\n     because  of his  low  performance  ranking compared  to\n     other chief engineers when Exxon  Shipping's oceangoing\n     fleet was downsized, then  no damages should be awarded\n     even  if  you  find  that  Exxon  Shipping  breached  a\n     contract with Mr. Ellenwood.\n\n          Under  such circumstances,  the  conduct of  Exxon\n     Shipping complained of here was not the proximate cause\n     of  any loss Mr. Ellenwood  suffered.  If  on the other\n     hand you  find that Mr.  Ellenwood would not  have been\n     terminated  when  the  fleet  was  downsized,  you  may\n     continue to consider damages.\n\n          During  this  case  a  number  of  witnesses  have\n     testified   regarding   Exxon  Shipping's   performance\n     evaluation and ranking system.  This case is  not about\n     whether  you  agree  with  or   like  Exxon  Shipping's\n     performance  evaluation  or   ranking  procedures,   or\n     whether  you  agree  with  or  like   Exxon  Shipping's\n     employment practices.  As  I previously instructed you,\n     you may not substitute your judgment for the company's.\n\n          I  therefore   instruct   you  that   your   views\n     concerning  whether Exxon Shipping's ranking system was\n     well  administered  cannot  be  considered  by  you  in\n     rendering  your decision  in this  case.   You  may not\n     consider whether in your opinion the evaluations or the\n     rankings are appropriate  or were done in  a manner you\n     agree with.\n\n          The sole  question you are to  consider is whether\n     Exxon Shipping  maintained its employee ranking list in\n     good faith.  In  deciding the question, plaintiffs have\n     the burden of  proof.  By  that I mean you  must decide\n     whether the  plaintiffs have proven  by a preponderance\n     of  the evidence  that  Exxon  Shipping manipulated  or\n\n                               -44-\n\n     otherwise misused its ranking procedure in bad faith to\n     cause Mr. Ellenwood to  be ranked lower on the  ranking\n     list of  chief engineers  than he otherwise  would have\n     been.\n\n          In   essence,   did   Exxon   Shipping   make  its\n     evaluations  of  Mr. Ellenwood  in  bad  faith with  an\n     intent  to  injure  him   in  order  to  improve  Exxon\n     Shipping's defense in this case.\n\n          If you conclude that plaintiffs have not proven by\n     a  preponderance  of the  evidence that  Exxon Shipping\n     acted in bad faith in establishing  its ranking list in\n     1989,  then  you  must  find  that  Mr.  Ellenwood  has\n     suffered  no  damages  under  either  of  his  contract\n     claims.\n\n                               -45-\n",

Shortly  after the  Exxon\n                                                                 \n\nValdez struck a  reef off  the Alaskan coast  in 1989,  defendant\n      \n\nExxon Shipping Company adopted a new policy barring  any employee\n\nwho had  ever participated  in an alcohol  rehabilitation program\n\nfrom  holding designated jobs  within the  company.   Pursuant to\n\nthis policy, plaintiff Theodore  Ellenwood, who had no connection\n\nto  the Valdez incident, was  removed from his  position as chief\n              \n\nengineer  of  another Exxon  oil  tanker,  the Exxon  Wilmington.\n                                                                \n\nEllenwood   voluntarily  had   entered,   and  successfully   had\n\ncompleted,  a  month-long alcohol  rehabilitation program  a year\n\nbefore  the Valdez  accident.   Despite  his  concerns about  his\n                  \n\ndrinking,  Ellenwood never  had  had an  on-the-job problem  with\n\nalcohol.   A  psychiatrist who  examined Ellenwood  in connection\n\nwith  this case concluded,  in fact,  that he  had never  been an\n\nalcoholic.  See Tr. Vol. V, at 133.\n               \n\n     Relying primarily  on the company's previous  written policy\n\nthat \"[n]o employees with alcoholism will have their job security\n\nor  future opportunities jeopardized due to a request for help or\n\ninvolvement in  a rehabilitation effort,\" Ellenwood  and his wife\n\nbrought suit against  Exxon alleging tort and  contract claims as\n\nwell as violations of  state statutes prohibiting  discrimination\n\nagainst  the  handicapped.1    Ellenwood  ultimately  received  a\n\n                    \n\n     1 The complaint  set forth the  following causes of  action:\nbreach of  contract (Count  I); breach  of a  duty of good  faith\narising out of Exxon's use of confidential information concerning\nEllenwood's alcohol treatment as a basis  for removing him (Count\nII); estoppel arising out of Exxon's representations and promises\n(Count III); wrongful discharge in violation of the public policy\npromoting  responsible  treatment   of  alcoholism  (Count   IV);\n\n                               -3-\n\njudgment  for $677,648  on his  contract and  promissory estoppel\n\ncauses of action.\n\n     In  these appeals, both sides contend,  inter alia, that the\n                                                       \n\ndistrict court  committed legal error in  defining the actionable\n\ncounts.  Ellenwood claims the judge eliminated too many claims on\n\nvarious legal grounds, depriving  him of additional relief, while\n\nExxon  claims  that  the court  allowed  too  many  counts to  be\n\ntried.2   We affirm most  of the  court's rulings.   We conclude,\n\nhowever,  that the  district court  overestimated the  preemptive\n\neffects of admiralty law  and the Rehabilitation Act of  1973, 29\n\nU.S.C.     701-796, and, accordingly, we must remand for trial on\n\nEllenwood's state statutory claims of handicap discrimination.3\n\n                    \n\ndiscrimination against the handicapped  contrary to various state\nlaws (Count V); misrepresentation over the career consequences of\nseeking alcohol  treatment (Count VI); intentional  and negligent\ninfliction  of emotional  distress on  both Ellenwoods  in ending\nEllenwood's  career  and  disseminating confidential  information\nconcerning  his condition  (Counts VII  and VIII);  defamation in\nremoving  Ellenwood from  his position  as chief  engineer (Count\nIX);  invasion of privacy in  the manner in  which Exxon obtained\nthe  information about  Ellenwood's  treatment and  disclosed  it\n(Count  X); invasion of privacy  in placing Ellenwood  in a false\nlight (Count XI); invasion of privacy in publicizing confidential\ninformation  (Count  XII); Mrs.  Ellenwood's  loss  of consortium\n(Count XIII); and punitive damages (Count XIV).\n\n     2  This  court  granted   the  State  of  Maine  provisional\npermission to intervene on the issue of whether Ellenwood's claim\nbased on  the Maine Human Rights Act, 2A Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n5,    4571-72 (Supp. 1992), is preempted by federal law.\n\n     3 The  complaint referred to  statutes in Maine,  New Jersey\nand Texas,  and we offer  no view as  to the applicable law.   We\nnote, however, that the district court applied Texas law to Count\nXII  of the complaint, which alleged an invasion of privacy.

Background\n             \n\n     Section 503 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29  U.S.C.  \n\n793, requires any  contract with the federal government in excess\n\nof  $2,500   to  include  a  provision   obligating  the  federal\n\ncontractor to \"take affirmative  action to employ and advance  in\n\nemployment qualified  individuals with  handicaps.\"  29  U.S.C.  \n\n793(a).  Any handicapped individual who believes a contractor has\n\nfailed  to comply with this  provision may file  a complaint with\n\nthe Department of Labor, which must conduct an investigation  and\n\ntake  appropriate  action.   29  U.S.C.    793(b).    Regulations\n\npromulgated pursuant  to   503 specify  a detailed administrative\n\nenforcement mechanism for its breach.  See 41 C.F.R.    60-741.1-\n                                          \n\n741.32  (1991).   The  Department's  Office  of Federal  Contract\n\nCompliance Programs  (OFCCP) is  empowered, for example,  to seek\n\ninjunctive relief in  court, terminate or  cancel a contract,  or\n\nbar  a contractor from receiving  future contracts.   41 C.F.R.  \n\n60-741.28(b)-(e)  (1991).  It also may seek such remedies as back\n\npay and reinstatement for affected employees.  See Dep't of Labor\n                                                                 \n\nv.

The  district court rejected this\n\ncontention,  finding  no  evidence  that  Congress  intended  the\n\nprovision  to eliminate  conventional  state law  claims such  as\n\nbreach of  contract, misrepresentation, defamation  or infliction\n\nof  emotional  distress,  because these  claims  \"are  in no  way\n\nrelated to the federal Rehabilitation Act, any affirmative action\n\nclause  in a  government contract,  or handicap  discrimination.\"\n\nSee Memorandum of Decision, Oct. 15, 1991, at 3.   The court also\n   \n\nruled, however, that   503 did preempt  Count V's direct claim of\n\ndiscrimination  on the basis of handicap  in violation of various\n\nstate statutes, and  Count IV's common law claim that Ellenwood's\n\ndischarge   violated  a   public  policy   promoting  responsible\n\ntreatment of alcoholism.\n\n     Neither party  is satisfied with this  Solomonic division of\n\nthe claims.   Accordingly, on  appeal, we are  asked to  consider\n\nboth Ellenwood's  claim that the  district court erred  in ruling\n\nthat    503  preempts  Counts  IV  and  V  and  Exxon's  contrary\n\nassertion  that the  district  court erred  in  finding that  the\n\nfederal  statute does  not  preempt the  contract and  promissory\n\nestoppel  claims on which Ellenwood received a jury verdict.  The\n\nState  of Maine joins  Ellenwood in arguing  that   503  does not\n\npreempt  a claim  of  handicap discrimination  brought under  its\n\n                    \n\n     5  According  to  Exxon,  only  Counts  X  and  XII  of  the\ncomplaint,  charging the  company  with obtaining  and disclosing\nprivate information, survived preemption.\n\n                               -6-\n\nHuman Rights Act, 2A Me.

Preemption Principles\n                        \n\n     The preemption  doctrine is rooted in  the Supremacy Clause,\n\nwhich  invalidates  state  laws  that  \"interfere  with,  or  are\n\ncontrary to, the laws of congress.\"  Gibbons v.

Our task, therefore,  is to determine whether there\n\nare  other  indicia  of  Congressional  intent  to  render  state\n\ndiscrimination  laws  ineffectual  against  federal  contractors.\n\nExxon essentially makes a two-pronged argument.   First, it cites\n\nlegislative  history suggesting  that  Congress sought  a uniform\n\n                               -8-\n\nfederal remedy for violations of   503, which would be frustrated\n\nif contractors  additionally were subject to  varying state laws.\n\nThus, according to Exxon, Congress must have intended  to preempt\n\nstate provisions.\n\n     Second,  Exxon  suggests that  the  detailed  nature of  the\n\nadministrative  scheme  promulgated   under     503  demonstrates\n\nCongress's intent  to foreclose  other types of  remedies against\n\nfederal contractors.   Exxon  maintains that, while  Congress has\n\nnot  fully occupied  the field  of handicap  discrimination, with\n\nrespect  to federal  contractors,  it  has  \"`left no  room'  for\n\nsupplementary state  regulation,\"  California Federal  Savings  &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nLoan Ass'n, 479 U.S. at 281.\n          \n\n     In our  view, what  Exxon offers  as proof  of an intent  to\n\npreempt  falls short  of the  mark.   The legislative  history on\n\nwhich  the company  relies  is  a  single  passage  in  a  Senate\n\nCommittee Report relating to amendments to the Rehabilitation Act\n\nthat were  enacted a year  after the Act itself.   The amendments\n\nmade no  change in either  sections 503 or  504 of the  Act,6 but\n\nthe Senate Report commented:\n\n          It  is  intended  that  sections 503  and  504  be\n     administered  in  such  a  manner  that  a  consistent,\n     uniform,    and    effective   Federal    approach   to\n     discrimination   against   handicapped  persons   would\n     result.  Thus, Federal  agencies and departments should\n     cooperate in developing standards and policies so  that\n     there  is a  uniform,  consistent  Federal approach  to\n     these sections.\n\n                    \n\n     6  Section 504,  29 U.S.C.    794,  prohibits discrimination\nagainst the handicapped in  federally funded programs, the United\nStates Postal Service, and in Executive agencies.\n\n                               -9-\n\nS.

In Howard, the  plaintiff had alleged a claim under\n                       \n\nAlabama law as a third party beneficiary of the   503 affirmative\n\naction clause contained in contracts between his employer and the\n\nfederal government.\n\n     The Eleventh Circuit  rejected this  claim.    It held  that\n\nstate  contract remedies  could  not be  used  to enforce     503\n\nessentially for the reasons Exxon has offered to us in support of\n\nits  preemption  argument.    Emphasizing  the  Senate   Report's\n\nreference to federal uniformity  and the comprehensiveness of the\n\n   503   administrative  scheme,   the  Howard  court   found  it\n                                              \n\n\"reasonable to infer that Congress left no room in section 503(b)\n\nfor state contract  actions to supplement it,\" id. at  1559.  The\n                                                 \n\ncourt   concluded   that  allowing   the  plaintiff   to  broaden\n\nenforcement of  the affirmative action  clause by means  of state\n\nlaw  could frustrate  directly  the specific  scheme designed  by\n\nCongress, allowing  a private  claim through  the back  door that\n\ncouldn't come through the front door.\n\n     An inference of preemption  was further warranted, the court\n\nheld, because  Congress's substantial  interest in  enforcing the\n\naffirmative  action  clause  --  determining  appropriate  terms,\n\nconditions  and  remedies  --  was \"more  substantial\"  than  the\n\n                               -12-\n\nstate's  interest   in  providing   a  remedy  for   third  party\n\nbeneficiaries seeking to enforce the same clause.

Here,  however,\n\nEllenwood  is  seeking to  enforce  not    503,  but  independent\n\nobligations created by state anti-discrimination statutes.\n\n     The claim in this  case does not threaten the  uniformity of\n                                                              \n\nthe     503  system.

First,  it  asserts  that\n\nCongress has a unique  interest in regulating federal contractors\n\nand,  second, it claims that  the area of handicap discrimination\n\nrequires an  extraordinary balancing of  competing interests that\n\ndistinguishes it from  other types of  employment discrimination,\n\nsuch  as those  involving race, gender  or age.   In the handicap\n\ndiscrimination   field,  Exxon  maintains,   the  possibility  of\n\nconflicting judgments is much greater because courts in different\n\njurisdictions could reach  widely disparate  conclusions on  such\n\nbasic  questions  as  what  constitutes a  \"handicap\"  and  which\n\nhandicapped persons are \"qualified\" to hold particular positions.\n\nRestricting individuals to their   503 remedy would ensure that a\n\nfederal  contractor doing business  in more than  one state would\n\nface uniform obligations nationwide.\n\n     We think it unlikely that Congress has a special interest in\n\nimmunizing   federal   contractors  from   obligations  otherwise\n\napplicable to them under state handicap  discrimination statutes.\n\nThese companies may do  only $2,500 in business with  the federal\n\ngovernment, with the bulk of their enterprise devoted to commerce\n\nwithin  a  single  state.    This  division  gives  the  state  a\n\nsubstantial interest  in protecting  the employment  interests of\n\nits  handicapped citizens.   The developing nature  of the issues\n\nraised in  the field  of handicap  discrimination  strikes us  as\n\n                    \n\nCongress evidently made the  sensible decision to avoid confusion\nby including an express provision.  \n\n                               -16-\n\ninsufficient  justification for  excusing  these  employers  from\n\nobligations imposed on others who differ only in that the federal\n\ngovernment is not one of their customers.\n\n     Moreover,  Exxon's  obligation  is  not  simply to  identify\n\nreasons why Congress might have departed from its usual practice,\n\nbut to demonstrate a reasonable basis for inferring that Congress\n\ndid, in fact, intend to make the federal remedy exclusive in this\n\nsingle  area of employment discrimination law.  Exxon has offered\n\nnothing from which we can discern such an intent. \n\n       In sum, we find no \"clear and manifest\" intent on the part\n\nof  Congress  to  preempt  state  handicap discrimination  claims\n\nagainst  federal contractors.  Indeed, we find no signals of such\n\nan intent.10\n\n     2. Contract and promissory estoppel.\n                                        \n\n     In its appeal, Exxon contends that the district court should\n\nhave extended its   503 preemption ruling to Ellenwood's contract\n\nand  promissory estoppel claims as  well.  Exxon  points out that\n\nthese claims  allege that  the company  breached an  agreement or\n\npromise  not   to  discriminate  on  the   basis  of  Ellenwood's\n\n\"handicap\"  of  alcohol  abuse.   Again  relying  solely  on  the\n\nuniformity rationale, Exxon argues that all state claims based on\n\nthe same  assertedly discriminatory  conduct are foreclosed  by  \n\n503.\n\n                    \n\n     10 Our  preemption analysis  applies as well  to Ellenwood's\nclaim for wrongful discharge based on public policy.  We offer no\nview,  however, as  to  whether such  a  claim exists  under  the\napplicable state law.\n\n                               -17-\n\n     Our ruling on the statutory claims also is dispositive here.\n\nWe note, however, one instance in which a contract claim based on\n\nstatements in a company policy manual may be  preempted by   503.\n\nRegulations  promulgated under the  statute require  employers to\n\npost  notices  of their  Rehabilitation  Act  obligations and  of\n\nemployee  rights under    503  in \"conspicuous  places.\"   See 41\n                                                              \n\nC.F.R.   60-741.4(d).  If  an employer included such a  notice in\n\nits  policy manual solely to comply with this regulation, a state\n\ncontract claim based on a breach of the manual provision arguably\n\nwould be preempted by the federal law.  See Arellano v. Amax Coal\n                                                                 \n\nCo., 56 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA)  1519, 1524-25 (D. Wy. 1991).\n   \n\nSuch a  claim, though in the  guise of a contract  claim based on\n\nthe manual, would seem no different from one directly asserting a\n\nbreach of   503.  A direct claim under   503 unquestionably would\n\nbe preempted for the reasons set out in Howard.\n                                              \n\n     Exxon does not  contend that  the statements  at issue  here\n\nwere  required by     503.   Indeed, such  a contention  would be\n\npatently unsupportable.  Ellenwood's contract and estoppel claims\n\nare  not  premised on  a  general notice  of  Exxon's affirmative\n\naction obligations toward handicapped  individuals, but on a very\n\nspecific written  assurance from the  company that  it would  not\n\ndisadvantage employees for seeking treatment for alcoholism.\n\n     We  therefore   hold  that  the  district   court  correctly\n\ndetermined that Ellenwood's contract and estoppel claims were not\n\npreempted by   503.\n\n                               -18-\n\n                  II. The Role of Admiralty Law\n                                               \n\n     Our conclusion that   503 does not preempt Ellenwood's state\n\nstatutory and common  law claims  does not end  our inquiry  into\n\nwhether those claims are  foreclosed by federal law.   Exxon also\n\ncontends that, even if   503  does not preempt them, maritime law\n\ndoes.  We consider this contention first as to the state statutes\n\nand second as to the contract and estoppel claims.\n\nA. State handicap discrimination statutes.\n                                         \n\n     In a brief footnote, the  district court observed that, even\n\nif it had erred in its judgment about   503 preemption, the state\n\nhandicap  discrimination claims nevertheless  would be foreclosed\n\nbecause  maritime law, rather than state  law, governs all issues\n\nsurrounding Ellenwood's  employment as a chief  engineer on board\n\nship.  The court  stated that, \"I am not aware of any basis under\n\nmaritime  law for such a recovery.\"  Memorandum of Decision, Oct.\n\n15, 1991, at 4 n.3.\n\n      The district court underestimated  the role state law plays\n\nin maritime cases.

See 1 Benedict on\n                                                                 \n\nAdmiralty    112,  at  7-36.

Congress's  only   legislation  in  the   area  of\n\nhandicapped rights  has not been directed at  maritime cases and,\n\nas  discussed  supra,  its  legislation  did  not  preempt  state\n                    \n\nremedies.  We find no indications that the absence of substantive\n\nmaritime  law  governing   issues  concerning  individuals   with\n\nhandicaps  reflects a  federal  interest  in protecting  maritime\n\nemployers from such obligations.   See 1 Benedict on  Admiralty  \n                                                               \n\n112,  at  7-37.

Contract and promissory estoppel.\n                                         \n\n                               -24-\n\n     Exxon  contends  that,  in  allowing the  jury  to  consider\n\nEllenwood's  contract and  estoppel  claims,  the district  court\n\nimproperly created an exception to the well-established rule that\n\nmaritime  employment is terminable at will by either party in the\n\nabsence  of a  contract setting  a specific  term.   According to\n\nExxon,  maritime  law  has  \"clung tenaciously\"  to  the  at-will\n\nprinciple,  and only  one  narrow exception  previously has  been\n\ncarved from it.  In Atlas Off-Shore Boat Serv., 653 F.2d at 1062-\n                                              \n\n63, the court  permitted a  claim for wrongful  discharge when  a\n\nseaman was fired for filing a  personal injury claim that he  was\n\nentitled  to file by statute.  No additional exceptions should be\n\nallowed  to erode  the  strength of  the at-will  doctrine, Exxon\n\nargues, since the seaman's rights as an employee already are well\n\nprotected  by federal statute.  See generally, e.g., 46 U.S.C.   \n                                                   \n\n10302,  10303, 10313,  10502,  10504,  10505, 10506  (prescribing\n\nprocedures governing meals, hours and wages for seamen).\n\n     Exxon misperceives  the district court's ruling.   The court\n\ndid  not devise  a new  \"wrongful discharge\"  cause of  action on\n\nbehalf  of Ellenwood.  It simply recognized the obvious fact that\n\n-- notwithstanding the general rule that a seaman's employment is\n\nat-will  -- a maritime employer may  make a contractual agreement\n\nwith, or an enforceable promise to, its employees.\n\n     In this case, Ellenwood claimed that Exxon had promised that\n\nhis  job   security  and   future  opportunities  would   not  be\n\njeopardized  if  he sought  treatment for  alcoholism.   The jury\n\nfound that the requirements for establishing a binding obligation\n\n                               -25-\n\nwere  met.  We  see no reason  why maritime law  would invalidate\n\nthis self-imposed obligation.13\n\n     Accordingly, we affirm the  district court's judgment on the\n\nbreach of contract and estoppel claims.  See infra Section V.\n                                                  \n\n         III.  Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress\n                                                         \n\n     The  jury awarded  Theodore Ellenwood  $50,000 and  his wife\n\n$25,000  on their  claims for  negligent infliction  of emotional\n\ndistress.   The district  court overturned these  verdicts on the\n\nground that  maritime plaintiffs may not  recover for negligently\n\ncaused  emotional  damages unless  they  demonstrate accompanying\n\nphysical  injury  or  impact.14    The  Ellenwoods  presented  no\n\nevidence of physical harm.\n\n     In  granting  judgment for  defendants,  the district  court\n\nnoted that the Supreme Court in Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Ry.\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     13 Exxon does not  argue that the district  court improperly\ninstructed  the jury  on  the elements  necessary to  establish a\ncontract or promissory estoppel claim in these circumstances, and\nwe therefore do not delve into this issue.  See, e.g., Pearson v.\n                                                              \nJohn Hancock Mutual  Life Ins.  Co., No. 92-1684,  slip op.  (1st\n                                   \nCir. Nov.  10, 1992)  (discussing factors necessary  to establish\ncontract based on employee manual).\n     We do note that, as  Exxon recognizes in its reply brief,  a\ncontract must  be \"reasonably  certain\" to  be enforceable.   See\n                                                                 \nRestatement (Second) of Contracts   33 (1981).

Arguably,  even  in a  routine  case, it  would  be\n\ninappropriate  for us to construct a theory of negligence so that\n\nwe could analyze a  claim of apparently little importance  to the\n\nplaintiffs.  A  fortiori, we would be ill-advised  to do so here,\n                        \n\nwhere we  are asked  to take  a precedential  step with a  highly\n\ncircumscribed license from the Supreme Court.22\n\n                    \n\n     21  Although  Mrs. Ellenwood's  claim  arises  under general\nmaritime law, the  limitations on recovery contained in the Jones\nAct  nonetheless  are relevant  because  her  claim is  based  on\nassertedly  negligent  conduct  governed  by the  statute.

Burden of Proof\n                                          \n\n     Exxon attempted  to prove at  trial that, even  if Ellenwood\n\nhad  not been  removed from  his chief  engineer's post  in April\n\n1989,  he would have  lost his job  later in the  year when Exxon\n\ndownsized its  fleet.   Consequently, because Exxon  continued to\n\npay Ellenwood's  full salary  and benefits through  January 1991,\n\nthe company argued that Ellenwood was not entitled to any damages\n\nfor breach of contract or promise.\n\n     On appeal, Exxon claims  that the district court incorrectly\n\ninstructed the jury that  the company bore the burden  of proving\n\nthat  Ellenwood would have been terminated  for bona fide reasons\n                                                         \n\nunrelated  to the new alcohol  rehabilitation policy.  The burden\n\nshould have been placed on the plaintiff, Exxon asserts, and this\n\nerror entitles the  company, at a minimum, to a  new trial on the\n\ncontract and estoppel claims.  \n\n                               -35-\n\n     We  find it unnecessary to consider this issue on the merits\n\nbecause we conclude  that Exxon  failed to preserve  it.  At  two\n\nseparate  times, once before the  jury charge and  once after it,\n\nthe court and  counsel discussed the instruction on this defense.\n\nOn the first occasion, during the precharge conference, the court\n\nannounced its decision to  impose the burden on the  defendant to\n\nprove  that  Ellenwood would  have lost  his job  for independent\n\nreasons, and  twice  repeated  its  intention  to  give  such  an\n\ninstruction.  See Tr. Vol. XI, at 24, 28, 29.\n                 \n\n     At  that  time,  Exxon  responded  by  asking  the  court to\n\ninclude,  within the  \"independent reasons\"  portion of  the jury\n\ncharge,  a sentence  about  \"business judgment.\"   This  addition\n\nwould have emphasized  to the jury  that, in considering  whether\n\nEllenwood would have been  terminated as a result of  the fleet's\n\ndownsizing, it was not permitted to second-guess Exxon's business\n\njudgment  in devising and applying  its ranking system.   See Tr.\n                                                             \n\nVol.  XI, at  26.   The  ensuing  discussion  focused on  how  to\n\ncommunicate  to the jury that its task was limited to determining\n\nwhether  the ranking  system  was  a  pretext.   The  instruction\n\nultimately adopted  by the  court included language  suggested by\n\nExxon's counsel.   Id. at 29.  At no  time during this discussion\n                     \n\ndid counsel object to the court's imposing the burden on Exxon.\n\n     Subsequently, the  district court  instructed the  jury that\n\n\"Exxon Shipping  has the  burden of  proof to  show you that  Mr.\n\nEllenwood would have lost  his job for independent, nonpretextual\n\nreasons,\" see Tr. Vol. XI,  at 51.  Following the full  charge on\n             \n\n                               -36-\n\nall claims, the district court held a sidebar conference in which\n\nit heard and responded  to both sides' objections.  At that time,\n\nExxon's counsel requested an \"additional  instruction\" on damages\n\nfor breach of contract or promise.\n\n     The  proposed  addition  consumes  43  lines  in  the  trial\n\ntranscript.   See  Tr.  Vol. XI,  at  64-66.25   The  first  four\n                 \n\nparagraphs  contained essentially  the  instruction  on  business\n\njudgment that  Exxon had requested earlier.   See Tr. Vol. XI, at\n                                                 \n\n65 (\"You may not consider whether in your opinion the evaluations\n\nor  the rankings  are appropriate  or were  done in a  manner you\n\nagree with.).   The next  section opens with  the assertion  that\n\n\"[t]he  sole  question  you  are  to  consider  is whether  Exxon\n\nShipping  maintained its  employee ranking  list in  good faith,\"\n\nid., and then states that, in deciding  the question, \"plaintiffs\n  \n\nhave  the  burden of  proof.\"    Id.   The  proposal  goes on  to\n                                   \n\nelaborate  on  the  plaintiff's  burden,  i.e.,  to  show  \"by  a\n\npreponderance of the evidence  that Exxon Shipping manipulated or\n\notherwise misused its ranking procedure in bad faith to cause Mr.\n\nEllenwood  to  be  ranked lower  on  the  ranking  list of  chief\n\nengineers than he otherwise would have been.\"  Id. at 65-66.\n                                                 \n\n     The district  court gave  the following response  to Exxon's\n\nproposal:\n\n          So far as the requested lengthy instruction  . . .\n     by  the defendant involving rank, proximate cause, good\n     faith, management  practices and so on,  I am satisfied\n     that  would involve me in too great a commentary on the\n\n                    \n\n     25 The  requested instruction is reproduced  in its entirety\nin an appendix to this opinion.\n\n                               -37-\n\n     evidence.    Instead,  I've   given  a  general  charge\n     concerning the  issue of whether  Exxon would otherwise\n     have terminated him, required  only that its reasons be\n     independent and  not pretextual.   I believe  that that\n     adequately meets the standards in this area.\n\nTr.  Vol. XI, at 72.  It  appears that the district court focused\n\nprimarily,  if not exclusively,  on the first  portion of Exxon's\n\nlengthy request  and concluded  that its own  pretext instruction\n\nadequately met Exxon's  concern that  the jury  not consider  how\n\ngood the  ranking system was but only whether it was used in good\n\nfaith.  Exxon  made no further  response and did  not inform  the\n\ncourt that it also was concerned about who had the burden on this\n\nissue.\n\n     What Exxon did  here was not enough to  entitle it to assert\n\nthis issue on appeal as a basis for a new trial.  Counsel did not\n\nobject  to the court's  burden instruction, but  proposed only an\n\naddition.   The  proposal was  long and,  in its  latter portion,\n\ncontradicted the court's earlier instruction on burden.  When the\n\ncourt reacted with comments apparently directed only to the first\n\npart of the  proposal, counsel  made no effort  to highlight  its\n\nconcern  regarding the  burden.   This  omission is  particularly\n\nsignificant  in light  of the  earlier discussion,  which focused\n\nsolely on the business judgment rule.  \n\n     Similarly, in its post-trial  memorandum seeking a new trial\n\non the contract and estoppel claims, under  the heading \"Employee\n\nRankings,\" Exxon argued only  that the court erred \"in  declining\n\nto instruct the jury that it could not  second guess the business\n\njudgment  of  Exxon  Shipping  with respect  to  its  performance\n\n                               -38-\n\nevaluations and employee ranking system.\"  See Memorandum, at  9.\n                                              \n\nAgain, no reference was made to the burden of proof.\n\n     Not until  its reply brief  on appeal  did Exxon  articulate\n\nclearly  and concisely its burden of proof objection.  It is well\n\nestablished, the company now contends, that the burden of proving\n\nbad  faith must  be  on the  party  seeking  to show  it  because\n\n\"[d]isproving bad  faith is  almost always close  to impossible.\"\n\nReply Brief, at 17.   Because the issue here was not  the quality\n\nof Exxon's ranking system, but  whether the system was maintained\n\nin good faith,  the company claims the burden should have been on\n\nEllenwood to  prove that  Exxon manipulated  its rankings  in bad\n\nfaith.\n\n     We do  not reach this argument  because it is too  late.  To\n\nconsider  disassembling  the  court and  jury's  substantial work\n\nwithout clearer  notice than  Exxon gave  to  the district  court\n\nwould be to  snub the requirement  in Fed. R.  Civ. P. 51 that  a\n\nparty must  \"stat[e] distinctly  the matter objected  to and  the\n\ngrounds  of objection.\"   Accordingly,  we leave  undisturbed the\n\ndistrict court's judgment on the contract and estoppel claims.\n\n                       VI. Benefits Offset\n                                          \n\n     Exxon has claimed error  in the district court's instruction\n\nto the  jury not to  offset the  damages award by  the amount  of\n\nspecial retirement benefits the  company has paid or will  pay to\n\nEllenwood.  Under a \"special sea service plan,\" Exxon contributed\n\nto  an  annuity  that  distributed monthly  payments  to  retired\n\n                               -39-\n\nemployees in  amounts based on life expectancy.   Ellenwood began\n\nreceiving annuity payments of nearly $20,000 a year following his\n\nretirement in  1991 at age 45.   It is these  payments that Exxon\n\nseeks to have offset.\n\n     Exxon's argument is based on  the general principle that  an\n\naward of  lost earnings makes the  wrongfully discharged employee\n\nwhole and  that to add pension benefits would give the employee a\n\nwindfall.   Ellenwood  counters with  his own  windfall argument:\n\nsubtracting the  expected benefits from the  damages award treats\n\nthe employer who breaches  an employment contract more charitably\n\nthan  one who  has observed  one faithfully.   Both  parties cite\n\ncaselaw to support their claims.\n\n     In fact, however, we  conclude that the record made  in this\n\ncase, rather than general principles,  dictates the result.   The\n\nrelevant facts are contained  in a letter from an  Exxon official\n\nin  response  to a  request from  Ellenwood's counsel  to provide\n\n\"[t]he  1990  percentages of  payroll  for  the various  benefits\n\nprovided  to  employees.\"    Brief  of   Plaintiffs-Appellees  at\n\nAddendum  18.   The  letter, which  is  not mentioned  in Exxon's\n\nbrief, itemized  the percentages of payroll  attributable to life\n\ninsurance, medical and dental insurance, Medicare, a thrift plan,\n\nlong term  disability insurance, workers' compensation,  and \"all\n\nother.\"  These items totalled 20.8%  But included in the listing,\n\nindeed  heading  the  list,  was \"Annuity\"  and  its  percentage,\n\n\"(2.7%)\".   In other words, this percentage was deducted from the\n\n                               -40-\n\ntotal of the  above listed  items, making the  bottom line  total\n\npercentage for fringe benefits 18.1%.\n\n     The effect  of this listing  was to indicate  to Ellenwood's\n\neconomic  expert on damages that he should add to his computation\n\nof lost earnings 18.1% of those earnings  to reflect compensation\n\nin  the form  of fringe  benefits.   Exxon did  not add  into the\n\nbenefits  total the 2.7% annuity  item, which would  amount to an\n\nannual  payment  of approximately  $2,300.    Indeed, the  letter\n\nsubtracted the 2.7% from the remaining total of benefits, thereby\n\nreducing by a substantial amount the present discounted value  of\n\nEllenwood's fringe benefits.\n\n     Had there  been no breach  of the  employment contract,  the\n\n$2,300  yearly  contribution  apparently  would  have  bought  an\n\nannuity that, upon Ellenwood's retirement  at age 65, would  have\n\nyielded annual payments in an amount much larger than the present\n\n$20,000 amount.   We look upon this amount as  having been bought\n\nby prior Exxon contributions  and earned by Ellenwood as  part of\n\nExxon's compensation package.  To allow Exxon a further deduction\n\nfor the  income stream  purchased  by the  annual $2,300  payment\n\nwould seem to be, as Ellenwood argues, to allow a double credit.\n\n     This,  at least, is how we read the testimony of plaintiff's\n\neconomist,  Dr. McCausland,  who  had asked  for the  percentages\n\napplicable to fringe benefits.  He testified that\n\n     the  fringe benefit  [sic] had  to be put  into present\n     value terms . . . , it's how many dollars do we have to\n     give  him  today so  he'll  have that  amount  of money\n     available  to  him in  each year  to  pay for  the same\n     fringe benefits.\n\n                               -41-\n\n          And I based it on their fringe benefit package . .\n     . .  And what I did, I took 18.1 percent of the present\n     value  of  lost earnings,  and  that  works out  to  be\n     $294,528.79.\n\nTr. Vol. V, at 111.  On cross examination Exxon's  counsel asked,\n\n\"Now you were also  aware that Mr. Ellenwood is  receiving almost\n\n$20,000 a year in pension benefits currently from Exxon  Shipping\n\nCompany?\"  To this, Ellenwood's counsel objected, saying, \"that's\n\nhis money, and it  is not properly considered to  be mitigation.\"\n\nWhereupon Exxon's counsel withdrew the question.  Id. at 121-122.\n                                                    \n\n     On this record  the district  court ruled that  it was  \"the\n\nburden of  proof of the defendant  to come forward and  show that\n\nthese are benefits being received that  should be subtracted from\n\nthe amounts that  plaintiff would  otherwise . .  . receive\"  and\n\nthat \"the state of the record doesn't permit that determination.\"\n\nTr. Vol. XI, at 35.   We agree.  Indeed, it seems to  us that the\n\nrecord  is not merely insufficient to support a basis for offset,\n\nbut points affirmatively to an already accomplished deduction.\n\n                         VII. Conclusion\n                                        \n\n     The following is a brief summary of our major holdings:\n\n     (1)    we reverse  the  district court's  ruling  that state\n\nstatutes  prohibiting discrimination against  the handicapped are\n\npreempted  by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and maritime law, as\n\nwell as its ruling  that plaintiff's claim of violation  of state\n\npublic policy is  similarly preempted, and the  case therefore is\n\nremanded for further proceedings on such claims;\n\n                               -42-\n\n     (2) we  affirm the district court's  ruling that Ellenwood's\n\nstate contract  and promissory estoppel claims  are not preempted\n\nby either the Rehabilitation Act or maritime law;\n\n     (3) we  decline to  address the  Ellenwoods' claim that  the\n\ndistrict court improperly granted Exxon's request for judgment as\n\na  matter  of law  on their  claims  for negligent  infliction of\n\nemotional  distress,   concluding  that  these  claims  were  not\n\nadequately developed;\n\n     (4) we  affirm the  district court's  refusal to  submit the\n\nissue of punitive damages to the jury;\n\n     (5) we find that  Exxon failed to preserve its  challenge to\n\nthe  district court's instruction imposing upon  it the burden of\n\ndemonstrating  that Ellenwood  would have  been removed  from his\n\nchief engineer's  position  in late  1989 for  bona fide  reasons\n                                                        \n\nindependent  of his  participation in  an alcohol  rehabilitation\n\nprogram;\n\n     (6) and we  affirm the district court's decision  to exclude\n\nfrom  the  jury's  damages  calculation  Ellenwood's sea  service\n\nretirement benefits.26\n\n     The judgment of the district  court is therefore affirmed in\n                                                                 \n\npart,  reversed in  part,  and remanded  for further  proceedings\n                                                                 \n\nconsistent with this opinion.  No costs. \n                                       \n\n                    \n\n     26  We  have  reviewed   the  district  court's  rulings  on\nEllenwood's privacy claims, and find no error. \n\n                               -43-\n\n                             APPENDIX\n\nThe following  is the full  text of  Exxon's proposed  additional\n\ninstruction  on damages  for breach  of contract  or  promise, as\n\ndiscussed supra at page 36.\n               \n\n     As you  know, Mr.  Ellenwood ceased receiving  a salary\n     from Exxon Shipping on  January 15, 1991.  If  you find\n     as Exxon Shipping claims  that Mr. Ellenwood would have\n     been  terminated prior to that time in the fall of 1989\n     because  of his  low  performance  ranking compared  to\n     other chief engineers when Exxon  Shipping's oceangoing\n     fleet was downsized, then  no damages should be awarded\n     even  if  you  find  that  Exxon  Shipping  breached  a\n     contract with Mr. Ellenwood.\n\n          Under  such circumstances,  the  conduct of  Exxon\n     Shipping complained of here was not the proximate cause\n     of  any loss Mr. Ellenwood  suffered.  If  on the other\n     hand you  find that Mr.  Ellenwood would not  have been\n     terminated  when  the  fleet  was  downsized,  you  may\n     continue to consider damages.\n\n          During  this  case  a  number  of  witnesses  have\n     testified   regarding   Exxon  Shipping's   performance\n     evaluation and ranking system.  This case is  not about\n     whether  you  agree  with  or   like  Exxon  Shipping's\n     performance  evaluation  or   ranking  procedures,   or\n     whether  you  agree  with  or  like   Exxon  Shipping's\n     employment practices.  As  I previously instructed you,\n     you may not substitute your judgment for the company's.\n\n          I  therefore   instruct   you  that   your   views\n     concerning  whether Exxon Shipping's ranking system was\n     well  administered  cannot  be  considered  by  you  in\n     rendering  your decision  in this  case.   You  may not\n     consider whether in your opinion the evaluations or the\n     rankings are appropriate  or were done in  a manner you\n     agree with.\n\n          The sole  question you are to  consider is whether\n     Exxon Shipping  maintained its employee ranking list in\n     good faith.  In  deciding the question, plaintiffs have\n     the burden of  proof.  By  that I mean you  must decide\n     whether the  plaintiffs have proven  by a preponderance\n     of  the evidence  that  Exxon  Shipping manipulated  or\n\n                               -44-\n\n     otherwise misused its ranking procedure in bad faith to\n     cause Mr. Ellenwood to  be ranked lower on the  ranking\n     list of  chief engineers  than he otherwise  would have\n     been.\n\n          In   essence,   did   Exxon   Shipping   make  its\n     evaluations  of  Mr. Ellenwood  in  bad  faith with  an\n     intent  to  injure  him   in  order  to  improve  Exxon\n     Shipping's defense in this case.\n\n          If you conclude that plaintiffs have not proven by\n     a  preponderance  of the  evidence that  Exxon Shipping\n     acted in bad faith in establishing  its ranking list in\n     1989,  then  you  must  find  that  Mr.  Ellenwood  has\n     suffered  no  damages  under  either  of  his  contract\n     claims.\n\n                               -45-\n</pre>",
