The issue in each of these\n\nconsolidated cases is the sufficiency of the complaint to state a\n\nclaim for failure to accommodate an employee’s disability as\n\nrequired by Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 794. The district court dismissed each under Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.                           We\n\nvacate and remand.\n\n              It takes nimble footwork to reach that exact issue.                  The\n\nappellants in these suits, Israel Sepúlveda-Villarini (Sepúlveda)\n\nand   Marta    Velázquez-Torruella        (Velázquez),      are       public    school\n\nteachers in Ponce, Puerto Rico.           The appellees are the Puerto Rico\n\nDepartment of Education; its Secretary, Rafael Aragunde-Torres\n\n(Aragunde); and the school director (and appellants’ supervisor),\n\nAlexis Oliveras-Santiago (Oliveras).                Aragunde is sued in his\n\nofficial capacity; Oliveras is sued in his personal capacity.\n\n              The   appellants’    claims      and    the    district          court’s\n\nresolution of them are largely similar, but differ somewhat in the\n\ndetails.       Sepúlveda     alleged   that   he    suffered      a    stroke    while\n\nteaching and required heart by-pass surgery.                 The nature of his\n\ncontinuing impairment is unclear, but he claims that his doctor\n\nordered him to apply for accommodations upon his return to work.\n\nThe   provision     of   a   reasonable      accommodation     to      a   qualified\n\nindividual with a disability is required by 42 U.S.C. § 12112.                    See\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\falso § 12102(2) (definition of disability); § 12111(8) & (9)\n\n(definitions       of    qualified      individual    with    a   disability       and\n\nreasonable accommodation).             For five school years the school made\n\naccommodations for            Sepúlveda, providing him a classroom on the\n\nfirst floor, a reduced class size of 15 pupils most years, and (at\n\nleast for some years) a rest period.1             Things changed in the 2007-\n\n08 year, after the Secretary had issued instructions to keep class\n\nsize at a minimum of 20.             Allegedly as a consequence, the school\n\ndirector enlarged Sepúlveda’s class to 30, but provided a neophyte\n\nteacher to share the duties.\n\n               Sepúlveda      claims    that    the   new    arrangement      is    an\n\nunreasonable       refusal      to   accommodate,     resulting     in   emotional\n\nconsequences with physical symptoms requiring treatment, and he\n\nseeks       monetary    and   equitable   relief.      His   citation    to    legal\n\nauthority is vague, but the district court understood him to raise\n\nclaims of unlawful discrimination under Title I of the ADA, 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 12111-12117 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of\n\ndisability by employers); Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-\n\n12165 (same, by government entities); § 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (same, by recipients of public funding) and\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et\n\n\n\n        1\n       The state of the complaint is such that the details of\nfactual allegations are often difficult to make out.     For the\npurposes of this appeal, the key accommodation appears to be the\nreduced class size.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fseq. (prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sex,\n\nrace, religion, national origin). The district court dismissed all\n\nclaims      of   personal     liability    against     the   school    director,\n\nOliveras,2 and all Title VII claims.             It dismissed the ADA Title I\n\nclaim for failure to allege how the smaller class size would allow\n\nSepúlveda to go on teaching and the Rehabilitation Act claim for\n\nthe same reason.       The court cited its ruling in a prior case to\n\nhold that Title II of the ADA did not reach employment-based claims\n\n(and in the alternative rejected the Title II claim on the same\n\ngrounds invoked for Title I).             With all federal claims gone, the\n\ncourt also dismissed without prejudice claims brought under the\n\nPuerto Rico Civil Code, for which supplemental jurisdiction was\n\nsought.\n\n              Velázquez      alleges   that     she   suffers   from   a   throat\n\ncondition known as aphonia, with symptoms including excessive\n\ncoughing and shortness of breath, which was allegedly aggravated by\n\ndust and debris stemming from construction at the school some years\n\nago.       Also on doctor’s orders, she sought accommodations for her\n\ndisability       and   for    four3    school     years   was   provided     with\n\naccommodations virtually identical to Sepúlveda’s, although her\n\n\n       2\n       The district court read the complaint to assert claims under\nthe ADA and Title VII against Oliveras in his official and personal\ncapacities. The complaint, however, states that Oliveras “is sued\nin his individual capacity under Puerto Rico law.”\n       3\n       Velázquez was denied accommodations the first year she\nrequested them.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fmaximum class size was generally 20 rather than 15.       When the\n\nSecretary’s instructions were circulated, her class size, too, was\n\nincreased (“up to thirty (30) students,” without a team teacher),\n\nand she, too, alleges that ensuing emotional and physical stress\n\nrequired treatment.   She seeks equitable relief and damages, in\n\npleadings the district court read to raise the same claims it found\n\nSepúlveda did.   Here, again, the Court dismissed the personal\n\nliability claims, all claims under Title VII, and the Title II\n\nclaim on the ground that the title does not refer to employment\n\ndiscrimination (this time providing no alternative basis).   Here,\n\nthough, the court addressed the appellees’ sovereign immunity\n\ndefense, which it had not reached in Sepúlveda’s case.   The court\n\nsustained the defense, dismissing the Title I claim against the\n\nDepartment in toto and against the Secretary insofar as Velázquez\n\nsought monetary damages. That left the Title I claim for equitable\n\nrelief against the Secretary, on the theory of Ex Parte Young, 209\n\nU.S. 123 (1908), which the court dismissed for the same reason\n\ngiven in the other case, a failure to allege in the pleadings how\n\nthe 20 pupil size accommodation requested would enable her to teach\n\nbut the larger class size would not. The Rehabilitation Act claim,\n\nas before, went the way of that under Title I, and supplemental\n\njurisdiction over actions under the Civil Code was again declined\n\nwithout prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f          The briefs for the appealing plaintiffs primarily address\n\nthe district court’s failure to apply properly the standard of\n\nreview under Rule 12(b)(6), and do not take issue with any of its\n\nconclusions of statutory interpretation or immunity from suit.        We\n\nthus infer that all claims of error are waived, except as to the\n\nsufficiency of allegations as stating claims that the Department\n\nand its Secretary are responsible under Title I or § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act for failures to make reasonable accommodations\n\nfor disabilities. While it is true that both appellants’ briefs do\n\nrefer to their “Title II pleadings,” they go no further than\n\nparaphrasing the statutory text and neglect to address the district\n\ncourt’s   ruling   that    Title   II    does   not   cover   employment\n\ndiscrimination.     Such   passing   and   conclusory   references   are\n\ninadequate to press an issue on appeal.\n\n          The statement of a claim of actionable failure to make\n\nreasonable employment accommodation for disability under either\n\nTitle I of the ADA or §504 of the Rehabilitation Act must allege a\n\ndisability covered by the statute, the ability of the plaintiff to\n\ndo a job with or without accommodation as the case may be, and the\n\nrefusal of the employer, despite knowledge of the disability, to\n\naccommodate the disability by reasonably varying the standard\n\nconditions of employment.    Enica v. Principi, 544 F.3d 328, 338 &\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fn.11 (1st Cir. 2008).    The district court found the allegations\n\ndeficient with respect to the third element.4\n\n          “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only ‘a\n\nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n\nentitled to relief,’ in order to ‘give the defendant fair notice of\n\nwhat the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”    Bell\n\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 8(a)(2) and Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)).    The\n\nmake-or-break standard, as the district court recognized, is that\n\nthe combined allegations, taken as true, must state a plausible,\n\nnot a merely conceivable, case for relief.   Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129\n\nS.Ct. 1937, 1950-51 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570); see\n\nalso Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (“Factual allegations must be enough\n\nto raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the\n\nassumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even\n\nif doubtful in fact).” (footnote and citations omitted)). “A claim\n\nhas facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content\n\nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.   The plausibility\n\nstandard is not akin to a `probability requirement,’ but it asks\n\nfor more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\n\nunlawfully.”   Id. at 1949 (citations omitted).\n\n\n     4\n       This dispositive focus on the third element was apparently\na sua sponte choice of the district court; neither motion to\ndismiss mentioned it.\n\n                                -8-\n\f           We think that the district court demanded more than\n\nplausibility.   Each set of pleadings includes two significant sets\n\nof allegations.   First, for a period of four or five school years\n\nthe school administration provided the reduced class size in\n\nresponse to the respective plaintiff’s request, supported by some\n\nsort of medical certification attesting to its legitimacy. In each\n\ncomplaint, those years of requested accommodation are put forward\n\nas establishing, in effect, a base-line of adequacy under the\n\nstatute in response to an implicit acknowledgment that a statutory\n\ndisability required the provisions that were made.5\n\n           Second, each set of pleadings describes changed facts\n\nbeginning in the 2007-08 year, in which instructions from the\n\ndefendant Secretary resulted in raising the class size to 30 (with\n\na young team teacher to share the load with Sepúlveda).             Each\n\ncomplaint alleges that the plaintiff’s emotional and physical\n\nhealth   subsequently   deteriorated   to   the   point   of   requiring\n\ntreatment, and each concludes that assigning 30 pupils was less\n\nthan reasonable accommodation under the statute.      To be sure, this\n\nsequence of alleged facts does not describe a causal connection in\n\nterms of the exact psychological or physiological mechanism by\n\nwhich each plaintiff’s capacity continues to be overwhelmed.        But\n\n\n\n     5\n       The precise location of the base-line is difficult to pin\ndown as the number of students in each appellant’s class varied\nsomewhat during the good years (from 15 to 20 for Sepúlveda; from\n“a maximum of 20” to “a minimum of 20” for Velázquez).\n\n                                 -9-\n\freading the allegations with the required favor to the plaintiff\n\nmeans accepting the changes in class size as the only variable,\n\nfrom which one would infer that there probably is some causal\n\nconnection between the work of a doubled class size and the\n\nphysical and emotional deterioration of the disabled teacher.\n\nAfter all, for years the school authorities themselves apparently\n\nthought the small classes were the reasonable and appropriate size;\n\nit does not seem remarkable that a teacher would be worn down by\n\ndoubling the size, even with a young helper, who will need to be\n\nsupervised.6\n\n           We therefore see the trial judge’s call for allegations\n\nexplaining “how” class size was significant and the change in size\n\nwas actionable as a call for pleading the details of medical\n\nevidence   in   order   to   bolster   the   likelihood   that   a   causal\n\nconnection will prove out as fact.           It may even be read as an\n\nexpression of skepticism that medical evidence would support the\n\ncausal claim that increased class size damaged health. But Twombly\n\n\n\n     6\n       In fact, Velázquez specifically alleges that “[t]his failure\nto accommodate her has aggravated her physical disability condition\nby the increase[d] use of her voice with the larger amount of\nstudents causing her pain, mental anguish, having to go . . . for\ntreatment and continued absences from her job.” Construed in the\nlight most favorable to her, this allegation seems to provide the\nexplanation the district court was looking for: “why a difference\nof ten students would impact Plaintiff’s ability to perform her job\nfunctions.”    The counterintuitive placement of this allegation\n(about “[t]his failure to accommodate”) at the end of a paragraph\notherwise describing only a year in which Velázquez received full\naccommodation may explain why the district court missed it.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcautioned against thinking of plausibility as a standard of likely\n\nsuccess on the merits; the standard is plausibility assuming the\n\npleaded facts to be true and read in a plaintiff’s favor.             See\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556 (“Asking for plausible grounds to infer an\n\nagreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading\n\nstage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable\n\nexpectation    that   discovery   will   reveal   evidence   of   illegal\n\n[conduct].”)\n\n          None of this is to deny the wisdom of the old maxim that\n\nafter the fact does not necessarily mean caused by the fact, but\n\nits teaching here is not that the inference of causation is\n\nimplausible (taking the facts as true), but that it is possible\n\nthat other, undisclosed facts may explain the sequence better.\n\nSuch a possibility does not negate plausibility, however; it is\n\nsimply a reminder that plausibility of allegations may not be\n\nmatched by adequacy of evidence.         A plausible but inconclusive\n\ninference from pleaded facts will survive a motion to dismiss, and\n\nthe fair inferences from the facts pleaded in these cases point to\n\nthe essential difference between each of them and the circumstances\n\nin Twombly, for example, in which the same actionable conduct\n\nalleged on the defendant’s part had been held in some prior cases\n\nto be lawful behavior.    See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 553-54, 564-69.\n\n          We therefore vacate the portion of the order in each case\n\nthat found the complaint inadequate to state a Title I violation,\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fand inadequate to state a Rehabilitation Act claim for the same\n\nreason.   We likewise vacate the order relating to the Commonwealth\n\nlaw claims, which were dismissed for want of any surviving federal\n\nclaim.    Costs are taxed against the Department of Education of\n\nPuerto Rico.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

For five school years the school made\n\naccommodations for            Sepúlveda, providing him a classroom on the\n\nfirst floor, a reduced class size of 15 pupils most years, and (at\n\nleast for some years) a rest period.1             Things changed in the 2007-\n\n08 year, after the Secretary had issued instructions to keep class\n\nsize at a minimum of 20.             Allegedly as a consequence, the school\n\ndirector enlarged Sepúlveda’s class to 30, but provided a neophyte\n\nteacher to share the duties.\n\n               Sepúlveda      claims    that    the   new    arrangement      is    an\n\nunreasonable       refusal      to   accommodate,     resulting     in   emotional\n\nconsequences with physical symptoms requiring treatment, and he\n\nseeks       monetary    and   equitable   relief.      His   citation    to    legal\n\nauthority is vague, but the district court understood him to raise\n\nclaims of unlawful discrimination under Title I of the ADA, 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 12111-12117 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of\n\ndisability by employers); Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-\n\n12165 (same, by government entities); § 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (same, by recipients of public funding) and\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et\n\n\n\n        1\n       The state of the complaint is such that the details of\nfactual allegations are often difficult to make out.     For the\npurposes of this appeal, the key accommodation appears to be the\nreduced class size.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fseq. (prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sex,\n\nrace, religion, national origin). The district court dismissed all\n\nclaims      of   personal     liability    against     the   school    director,\n\nOliveras,2 and all Title VII claims.             It dismissed the ADA Title I\n\nclaim for failure to allege how the smaller class size would allow\n\nSepúlveda to go on teaching and the Rehabilitation Act claim for\n\nthe same reason.       The court cited its ruling in a prior case to\n\nhold that Title II of the ADA did not reach employment-based claims\n\n(and in the alternative rejected the Title II claim on the same\n\ngrounds invoked for Title I).             With all federal claims gone, the\n\ncourt also dismissed without prejudice claims brought under the\n\nPuerto Rico Civil Code, for which supplemental jurisdiction was\n\nsought.\n\n              Velázquez      alleges   that     she   suffers   from   a   throat\n\ncondition known as aphonia, with symptoms including excessive\n\ncoughing and shortness of breath, which was allegedly aggravated by\n\ndust and debris stemming from construction at the school some years\n\nago.       Also on doctor’s orders, she sought accommodations for her\n\ndisability       and   for    four3    school     years   was   provided     with\n\naccommodations virtually identical to Sepúlveda’s, although her\n\n\n       2\n       The district court read the complaint to assert claims under\nthe ADA and Title VII against Oliveras in his official and personal\ncapacities. The complaint, however, states that Oliveras “is sued\nin his individual capacity under Puerto Rico law.”\n       3\n       Velázquez was denied accommodations the first year she\nrequested them.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fmaximum class size was generally 20 rather than 15.       When the\n\nSecretary’s instructions were circulated, her class size, too, was\n\nincreased (“up to thirty (30) students,” without a team teacher),\n\nand she, too, alleges that ensuing emotional and physical stress\n\nrequired treatment.   She seeks equitable relief and damages, in\n\npleadings the district court read to raise the same claims it found\n\nSepúlveda did.   Here, again, the Court dismissed the personal\n\nliability claims, all claims under Title VII, and the Title II\n\nclaim on the ground that the title does not refer to employment\n\ndiscrimination (this time providing no alternative basis).   Here,\n\nthough, the court addressed the appellees’ sovereign immunity\n\ndefense, which it had not reached in Sepúlveda’s case.   The court\n\nsustained the defense, dismissing the Title I claim against the\n\nDepartment in toto and against the Secretary insofar as Velázquez\n\nsought monetary damages. That left the Title I claim for equitable\n\nrelief against the Secretary, on the theory of Ex Parte Young, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1908), which the court dismissed for the same reason\n\ngiven in the other case, a failure to allege in the pleadings how\n\nthe 20 pupil size accommodation requested would enable her to teach\n\nbut the larger class size would not. The Rehabilitation Act claim,\n\nas before, went the way of that under Title I, and supplemental\n\njurisdiction over actions under the Civil Code was again declined\n\nwithout prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f          The briefs for the appealing plaintiffs primarily address\n\nthe district court’s failure to apply properly the standard of\n\nreview under Rule 12(b)(6), and do not take issue with any of its\n\nconclusions of statutory interpretation or immunity from suit.        We\n\nthus infer that all claims of error are waived, except as to the\n\nsufficiency of allegations as stating claims that the Department\n\nand its Secretary are responsible under Title I or § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act for failures to make reasonable accommodations\n\nfor disabilities. While it is true that both appellants’ briefs do\n\nrefer to their “Title II pleadings,” they go no further than\n\nparaphrasing the statutory text and neglect to address the district\n\ncourt’s   ruling   that    Title   II    does   not   cover   employment\n\ndiscrimination.     Such   passing   and   conclusory   references   are\n\ninadequate to press an issue on appeal.\n\n          The statement of a claim of actionable failure to make\n\nreasonable employment accommodation for disability under either\n\nTitle I of the ADA or §504 of the Rehabilitation Act must allege a\n\ndisability covered by the statute, the ability of the plaintiff to\n\ndo a job with or without accommodation as the case may be, and the\n\nrefusal of the employer, despite knowledge of the disability, to\n\naccommodate the disability by reasonably varying the standard\n\nconditions of employment.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1937</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1950-51 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570); see\n\nalso Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (“Factual allegations must be enough\n\nto raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the\n\nassumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even\n\nif doubtful in fact).” (footnote and citations omitted)). “A claim\n\nhas facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content\n\nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.   The plausibility\n\nstandard is not akin to a `probability requirement,’ but it asks\n\nfor more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\n\nunlawfully.”   Id. at 1949 (citations omitted).\n\n\n     4\n       This dispositive focus on the third element was apparently\na sua sponte choice of the district court; neither motion to\ndismiss mentioned it.\n\n                                -8-\n\f           We think that the district court demanded more than\n\nplausibility.   Each set of pleadings includes two significant sets\n\nof allegations.   First, for a period of four or five school years\n\nthe school administration provided the reduced class size in\n\nresponse to the respective plaintiff’s request, supported by some\n\nsort of medical certification attesting to its legitimacy. In each\n\ncomplaint, those years of requested accommodation are put forward\n\nas establishing, in effect, a base-line of adequacy under the\n\nstatute in response to an implicit acknowledgment that a statutory\n\ndisability required the provisions that were made.5\n\n           Second, each set of pleadings describes changed facts\n\nbeginning in the 2007-08 year, in which instructions from the\n\ndefendant Secretary resulted in raising the class size to 30 (with\n\na young team teacher to share the load with Sepúlveda).             Each\n\ncomplaint alleges that the plaintiff’s emotional and physical\n\nhealth   subsequently   deteriorated   to   the   point   of   requiring\n\ntreatment, and each concludes that assigning 30 pupils was less\n\nthan reasonable accommodation under the statute.      To be sure, this\n\nsequence of alleged facts does not describe a causal connection in\n\nterms of the exact psychological or physiological mechanism by\n\nwhich each plaintiff’s capacity continues to be overwhelmed.        But\n\n\n\n     5\n       The precise location of the base-line is difficult to pin\ndown as the number of students in each appellant’s class varied\nsomewhat during the good years (from 15 to 20 for Sepúlveda; from\n“a maximum of 20” to “a minimum of 20” for Velázquez).\n\n                                 -9-\n\freading the allegations with the required favor to the plaintiff\n\nmeans accepting the changes in class size as the only variable,\n\nfrom which one would infer that there probably is some causal\n\nconnection between the work of a doubled class size and the\n\nphysical and emotional deterioration of the disabled teacher.\n\nAfter all, for years the school authorities themselves apparently\n\nthought the small classes were the reasonable and appropriate size;\n\nit does not seem remarkable that a teacher would be worn down by\n\ndoubling the size, even with a young helper, who will need to be\n\nsupervised.6\n\n           We therefore see the trial judge’s call for allegations\n\nexplaining “how” class size was significant and the change in size\n\nwas actionable as a call for pleading the details of medical\n\nevidence   in   order   to   bolster   the   likelihood   that   a   causal\n\nconnection will prove out as fact.           It may even be read as an\n\nexpression of skepticism that medical evidence would support the\n\ncausal claim that increased class size damaged health. But Twombly\n\n\n\n     6\n       In fact, Velázquez specifically alleges that “[t]his failure\nto accommodate her has aggravated her physical disability condition\nby the increase[d] use of her voice with the larger amount of\nstudents causing her pain, mental anguish, having to go . . . for\ntreatment and continued absences from her job.” Construed in the\nlight most favorable to her, this allegation seems to provide the\nexplanation the district court was looking for: “why a difference\nof ten students would impact Plaintiff’s ability to perform her job\nfunctions.”    The counterintuitive placement of this allegation\n(about “[t]his failure to accommodate”) at the end of a paragraph\notherwise describing only a year in which Velázquez received full\naccommodation may explain why the district court missed it.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcautioned against thinking of plausibility as a standard of likely\n\nsuccess on the merits; the standard is plausibility assuming the\n\npleaded facts to be true and read in a plaintiff’s favor.             See\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556 (“Asking for plausible grounds to infer an\n\nagreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading\n\nstage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable\n\nexpectation    that   discovery   will   reveal   evidence   of   illegal\n\n[conduct].”)\n\n          None of this is to deny the wisdom of the old maxim that\n\nafter the fact does not necessarily mean caused by the fact, but\n\nits teaching here is not that the inference of causation is\n\nimplausible (taking the facts as true), but that it is possible\n\nthat other, undisclosed facts may explain the sequence better.\n\nSuch a possibility does not negate plausibility, however; it is\n\nsimply a reminder that plausibility of allegations may not be\n\nmatched by adequacy of evidence.         A plausible but inconclusive\n\ninference from pleaded facts will survive a motion to dismiss, and\n\nthe fair inferences from the facts pleaded in these cases point to\n\nthe essential difference between each of them and the circumstances\n\nin Twombly, for example, in which the same actionable conduct\n\nalleged on the defendant’s part had been held in some prior cases\n\nto be lawful behavior.    See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 553-54, 564-69.\n\n          We therefore vacate the portion of the order in each case\n\nthat found the complaint inadequate to state a Title I violation,\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fand inadequate to state a Rehabilitation Act claim for the same\n\nreason.   We likewise vacate the order relating to the Commonwealth\n\nlaw claims, which were dismissed for want of any surviving federal\n\nclaim.    Costs are taxed against the Department of Education of\n\nPuerto Rico.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f</pre>",
