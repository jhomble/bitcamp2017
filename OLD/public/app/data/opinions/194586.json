This appeal, which arises out of\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nan insurance company's efforts to secure a binding declaration of\n\nits  rights  and responsibilities  under  an  insurance contract,\n\nposes  an  intriguing  question:    does  the  \"officer  removal\"\n\nstatute, 28 U.S.C.   1442(a)(1), permit a  federal official, sued\n\nonly  in her  representative  capacity, to  remove  an action  to\n\nfederal district court?   Because we think that the  statute does\n\nnot confer such a right, and because there is no other cognizable\n\nbasis  for  federal  jurisdiction,  we return  the  case  to  the\n\ndistrict court with instructions  that it be remitted to  a state\n\nforum.\n\n                                I\n\n          From  1917  until  1977,  a  succession  of  dye-houses\n\noccupied  a thirty-five  acre  plot  in  Ashland,  Massachusetts.\n\nDuring  these six  decades,  toxic wastes  impregnated the  site.\n\nEventually,  the  United States  Environmental  Protection Agency\n\n(EPA)  and   the   Massachusetts  Department   of   Environmental\n\nProtection (DEP)  discovered  the pollution  and  documented  its\n\nsource  in the dye manufacturing  processes.  In  early 1982, EPA\n\nnotified Nyacol Products, Inc.  (Nyacol), a producer of colloidal\n\nsilicas at  a portion  of the site,  that it considered  Nyacol a\n\npotentially  responsible  party  (PRP)  under  the  Comprehensive\n\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA),\n\n42 U.S.C.    9601-9626, 9651-9662, 9671-9675.1\n\n                    \n\n     1EPA also branded two of Nyacol's officers, Robert Lurie and\nThomas L.  O'Connor, as PRPs.   Lurie and  O'Connor are named  as\ndefendants in the  instant suit.  For ease in reference, we refer\n\n                                3\n\n          Pursuant to Massachusetts law,  which deems PRP notices\n\nequivalent  to  law  suits  for  the  purpose  of  triggering  an\n\ninsurer's  duty to defend, see  Hazen Paper Co.  v. United States\n                                                                 \n\nFid. &amp; Guar. Co., 555 N.E.2d 576, 581 (Mass. 1990), Nyacol called\n                \n\nupon   its   insurance   carrier,  plaintiff-appellant   American\n\nPolicyholders  Insurance Company (American), to defend it against\n\nEPA's claims and  to indemnify  it for loss,  costs, damages,  or\n\nother expense related thereto.   American provisionally undertook\n\nthe company's  defense under  its general  liability policy.   In\n\nDecember of 1991, American brought suit in a Massachusetts  state\n\ncourt seeking a declaration  that it had no obligation  to defend\n\nor recompense its insureds.   In addition to naming  the insureds\n\nas parties  defendant,  American  joined  two  other  defendants:\n\nJulie Belaga,  in her  capacity as EPA'S  Regional Administrator,\n\nand Daniel S. Greenbaum,  in his capacity as Commissioner  of the\n\nDEP.    Invoking  the  officer  removal   statute,  28  U.S.C.   \n\n1442(a)(1),Belaga transferredthe actionto federaldistrict court.2\n\n                    \n\nto the  company and  the individual defendants,  collectively, as\n\"Nyacol\"  or \"the  insureds.\"  We  note, moreover,  that although\nEPA,  invoking a  theory of  successor liability,  notified these\nthree defendants  that they  might be  liable for  EPA's response\ncosts  (past and future), as  well as for  cleanup costs, EPA has\nnot yet sued  to compel payment of these expenses or otherwise to\nenforce its claimed rights.\n\n     2The officer removal statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n               A civil action  or criminal  prosecution\n          commenced in a State court against any of the\n          following persons may be  removed by them  to\n          the  district court of  the United States for\n          the district and division embracing the place\n          wherein it is pending:\n\n                                4\n\n          On  February  20, 1992,  DEP agreed  to  be bound  by a\n\ndeclaration  of  rights  in  American's lawsuit  insofar  as  the\n\njudgment resolves insurance coverage  issues.  The case proceeded\n\nagainst Belaga and the  insureds.  On May 12,  1992, the district\n\ncourt granted Belaga's motion to  dismiss, reasoning that a  suit\n\nagainst  her, in her official capacity, was really a suit against\n\nEPA  and that,  since EPA  had never  sued  Nyacol or  brought an\n\nenforcement proceeding  against it, American could  articulate no\n\njusticiable  controversy  with  EPA.   The  court  entered  final\n\njudgment for Belaga,  see Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), and remanded all\n                         \n\nother  parties and claims to  the state court.   American appeals\n\nfrom the dismissal order.\n\n                                II\n\n          While  the  parties  vigorously  debate   an  insurance\n\ncompany's  ability,   consistent  with  Article  III's   case  or\n\ncontroversy requirement, to join EPA in a coverage dispute before\n\nEPA has brought  an enforcement action against the  insureds, our\n\ndiscussion seeps into vastly different legal ground.  The impetus\n\nbehind this  diversion lies  in  the Supreme  Court's opinion  in\n\nInternational  Primate  Protection  League  v.  Administrators of\n                                                                 \n\nTulane Educ. Fund, 111 S. Ct.  1700 (1991).  Concerned about  the\n                 \n\nimplications  of  Primate  Protection League  for  federal  court\n                                            \n\n                    \n\n                 (1) Any  officer of the  United States\n          or any agency thereof, or person acting under\n          him, for any act under color of such office .\n          . . .\n\n28 U.S.C.   1442(a)(1) (1988).\n\n                                5\n\njurisdiction, we requested supplemental  briefing on whether this\n\naction  was  properly  removed  to federal  court.    Both  sides\n\nresponded that  removal was valid  under 28  U.S.C.    1442(a)(1)\n\nbecause of Belaga's status as a federal officer.\n\n          Notwithstanding this accord, we must pursue the matter.\n\nLitigants cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction by agreement.\n\nSee  Insurance Corp. of Ir.  v. Compagnie des  Bauxites, 456 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n694,  702  (1982); California  v. LaRue,  409  U.S. 109,  113 n.3\n                                       \n\n(1972).   Because a federal court is  under an unflagging duty to\n\nensure  that it has jurisdiction  over the subject  matter of the\n\ncases  it proposes to adjudicate,  we are obliged  to address the\n\npropriety of  removal as a  threshold matter even  though neither\n\nparty  has  raised a  question in  that  regard.   See Mansfield,\n                                                                 \n\nColdwater  &amp; Lake Michigan  Ry. Co.  v. Swan,  111 U.S.  379, 382\n                                            \n\n(1884)  (stating  that  a federal  appellate  court,  on  its own\n\nmotion,  must \"deny its own jurisdiction, and, in the exercise of\n\nits  appellate  power, that  of all  other  courts of  the United\n\nStates,   in  all   cases  where   such  jurisdiction   does  not\n\naffirmatively appear in the record\").\n\n                                A\n\n          The officer  removal statute, 28 U.S.C.    1442 (a)(1),\n\nquoted supra note  2, is  designed to allow  federal officers  to\n            \n\nremove  actions   to  federal  court  that   would  otherwise  be\n\nunremovable.   See Willingham  v. Morgan,  395  U.S. 402,  406-07\n                                        \n\n(1969)  (stating  that  the section  covers  all  cases in  which\n\nfederal officers,  sued in  state court, \"can  raise a  colorable\n\n                                6\n\ndefense arising out of their duty to enforce federal law\").3   In\n\nPrimate  Protection  League,  the  Supreme Court  held  that  the\n                           \n\nreference to \"any agency\"  of the United States contained  in the\n\nofficer removal statute did not stand alone, but constituted part\n\nof a possessive phrase modifying the  noun \"officer.\"  See 111 S.\n                                                          \n\nCt. at 1705.  Put another way, the statute is to be read as  if a\n\nsecond  \"of\"  appeared  in  the text  immediately  following  the\n\ndisjunctive \"or.\"   Hence, section 1442(a)(1)  permits removal by\n\nan \"officer  of . .  . any agency  [of the United  States],\" and,\n\nconversely, does not permit removal by the federal agency itself.\n\nSee id. at 1709.\n       \n\n          Although  Primate Protection  League  makes it  crystal\n                                              \n\nclear  that EPA, as a federal agency,  cannot remove an action to\n\nfederal  court  under  color  of section  1442(a)(1),  this  case\n\npresents  a variation on the  theme:  it  requires that we decide\n\nthe  closely  related,  but nonetheless  different,  question  of\n\nwhether,  for purposes  of the  officer  removal statute,  a suit\n\nbrought against  an executive  of an  agency, exclusively  in the\n                                                                 \n\nexecutive's  official capacity,  constitutes  a suit  against  an\n                              \n\n\"officer,\"  thereby permitting  removal under  the statute,  or a\n\nsuit against an \"agency,\" thereby precluding such removal.  It is\n\n                    \n\n     3This  is not  to say  that every  case in  which a  federal\n                                      \nofficer  is a defendant is removable.  Rather, removal is limited\nto   situations  in   which   the   officer's  removal   petition\ndemonstrates the existence  of a  federal defense.   See Mesa  v.\n                                                             \nCalifornia, 489 U.S. 121, 136 (1989).\n          \n\n                                7\n\nto this inquiry that we now turn.4\n\n                                B\n\n          Generally, a  suit against an officer  in the officer's\n\nofficial capacity  constitutes  a suit  against the  governmental\n\nentity  which the  officer heads.   For  example, in  Kentucky v.\n                                                              \n\nGraham, 473 U.S. 159  (1985), the Court dwelt on  the distinction\n      \n\nbetween  suits against a person  in an individual,  as opposed to\n\nofficial, capacity.   The Court explained  that while individual-\n\ncapacity  actions  \"seek  to  impose personal  liability  upon  a\n                                             \n\ngovernment official,\" id. at 165 (emphasis supplied), payable out\n                         \n\nof personal assets,  see id. at 166,  an official-capacity action\n                            \n\nis, \"in  all respects other  than name, to  be treated as  a suit\n\nagainst  the  entity.\"    Id.   Phrased  differently,  \"official-\n                             \n\ncapacity suits  generally represent only another  way of pleading\n\nan action  against an entity  of which an  officer is an  agent.\"\n\nMonell v. New York City Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690\n                                              \n\nn.55 (1978).   Thus, a string of Supreme Court cases holds that a\n\nsuit against a government officer in his or her official capacity\n\nbinds the agency  or other governmental  entity, not the  officer\n\npersonally.  See, e.g., Graham, 473 U.S. at 166; Brandon v. Holt,\n                                                                \n\n469  U.S. 464,  471  (1985); cf.  Larson  v. Domestic  &amp;  Foreign\n                                                                 \n\nCommerce Corp.,  337 U.S.  682, 687  (1949) (explaining that,  in\n              \n\ndeciding  whether  a  suit  against a  government  officer  is an\n\nofficial-capacity  or  individual-capacity  suit,   \"the  crucial\n\n                    \n\n     4The  officer  removal  statute  was first  enacted  in  its\npresent  form  in  1948.    Its  legislative  history  is  of  no\nsignificant assistance in respect to the inquiry at hand.\n\n                                8\n\nquestion is whether the relief sought . . . is relief against the\n\nsovereign\").\n\n          The  character  of  an  official-capacity suit  is  not\n\ntransformed simply because jurisdiction is in issue.  In Loeffler\n                                                                 \n\nv. Frank, 486 U.S. 549 (1988), a case in which the plaintiff sued\n        \n\nthe Postmaster General in  his official capacity, the Court  held\n\nthat acts of a  government officer in his official  capacity \"are\n\nalways chargeable\" as  acts of the agency for purposes  of a sue-\n\nand-be-sued clause.   Id. at 563  n.8; see also FHA  v. Burr, 309\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 242, 249-50  (1940) (holding that a suit against the head of\n\nan agency in  his official capacity was  indistinguishable from a\n\nsuit against the agency itself for purposes of  a sue-and-be-sued\n\nclause  and  that a  waiver of  immunity  as to  the  agency head\n\nnecessarily waived the agency's  immunity).  Similarly, even when\n\npondering  jurisdictional  and quasi-jurisdictional  issues, this\n\ncourt has consistently accepted and applied the principle that an\n\nofficial-capacity  suit  against a  government  officer  is fully\n\nequivalent  to a suit against  the agency.   See, e.g., Northeast\n                                                                 \n\nFed. Credit  Union v.

Corp. v. Rivera\n                                                                 \n\nRios,  813 F.2d  506, 516  (1st Cir.  1987) (observing  that, for\n    \n\nEleventh  Amendment   purposes,  an  official-capacity   suit  is\n\n\"tantamount to a suit against the [governmental entity]\").\n\n          We see no reason  to forsake the general rule    that a\n\n                                9\n\nsuit against a government officer in his or her official capacity\n\nis   a  suit   against  the   agency      when  considering   the\n\nappropriateness of  removal under 28  U.S.C.    1442(a)(1).   The\n\ntheme of Primate Protection League, logically extended, serves an\n                                  \n\nesemplastic purpose,  shaping the officer removal  statute into a\n\nrational whole.  In  that case, the Supreme Court  explained that\n\nwhen a suit for monetary damages is brought against an officer in\n\nhis or  her individual  capacity, the complicated  questions that\n\narise as to that officer's immunity support a protective grant of\n\nremoval jurisdiction.  See Primate Protection League, 111 S.  Ct.\n                                                    \n\nat 1708.   By contrast, agencies do  not need the prophylaxis  of\n\nfederal removal because determining an agency's immunity,  unlike\n\ndetermining   an  individual's   immunity,  is   a  \"sufficiently\n\nstraightforward\"  proposition.   Id.    That  rationale  strongly\n                                    \n\nfavors  treatment  of  official-capacity suits  for  purposes  of\n\nremoval in  the same manner as  suits against the agency.   After\n\nall, because a suit  against an officer in her  official capacity\n\ncannot bind the officer personally,  see, e.g., Brandon, 469 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat 471, no issues of immunity can possibly arise that differ from\n\nthose arising in a suit directly against the agency.\n\n          Consistency    is    the   touchstone    of   statutory\n\ninterpretation.  If we were to hold that a suit nominally against\n\nEPA is not removable, as  Primate Protection League demands,  but\n                                                   \n\nthen  go on to hold that a  suit nominally against EPA's regional\n\nadministrator  in her  official capacity    a  suit that  seeks a\n\njudgment  binding on the EPA   is nonetheless removable, we would\n\n                                10\n\nspawn a  glaring interpretive inconsistency and,  in the bargain,\n\nimpugn  the Primate  Court's reasoning.   Given  the identity  of\n                   \n\njuridical interest  that exists  between a government  agency and\n\nits executive officer when the latter is sued only in  his or her\n\nofficial capacity, the  fact that  the agency may  not remove  an\n\naction under  the officer removal statute  compels the conclusion\n\nthat  an official-capacity  defendant is  likewise  disabled from\n\ninitiating   removal   thereunder.5      See   generally  Primate\n                                                                 \n\nProtection  League, 111 S. Ct. at 1708 (explaining that access to\n                  \n\nremoval  under  section  1442(a)(1)  does  not  turn  on  a \"mere\n\ntechnicality\").\n\n                                C\n\n          Our conclusion is  fortified by Judge  Posner's opinion\n\nin Western Secs. Co. v. Derwinski, 937 F.2d 1276 (7th Cir. 1991).\n                                 \n\n                    \n\n     5Ordinarily, the  question of  whether a complaint  names an\nofficer  in  a  personal, as  opposed  to  an official,  capacity\nrequires  little  more  than a  glance  at  the  pleadings.   If,\nhowever,  a  federal official,  reasonably  believing  himself or\nherself to be sued individually, attempts to remove under section\n1442(a)(1),  any   dispute  as  to  the   officer's  status  will\nnecessarily  be resolved  by a  federal court  in the  context of\nassaying its own  jurisdiction.   See 14A Charles  A. Wright  et.\n                                     \nal.,  Federal   Practice  and   Procedure     3730,   at  499-500\n                                         \n(explaining that a defendant  wishing to remove need only  file a\nnotice of removal, with the result that the propriety of removal,\nif challenged at  all, will \"be tested later in the federal court\nby a  motion to remand\").  Thus, our holding that an officer sued\nin an official  capacity may not  remove the  action in order  to\nobtain a  federal forum for  resolution of the  underlying merits\nwill in no way deprive  the officer of access to a  federal forum\nfor  determination of  whether  the suit  is  in fact  an  action\nagainst him or her personally.   By the same token, if an officer\nis sued in both individual and official capacities, we see no bar\nto  removal under  section 1442(a)(1).   See  El Gran  Video Club\n                                                                 \nCorp. v. E.T.D., Inc., 757 F.

Acknowledging\n\nthat,  in  the  aftermath  of Primate  Protection  League,  suits\n                                                         \n\nagainst  federal   agencies  cannot  be   removed  under  section\n\n1442(a)(1), see id. at  1278, Judge Posner wrote that  \"while the\n                   \n\nsuit in this case  is nominally against the Administrator,  it is\n\nagainst   him  in  his  official  capacity  and  such  suits  are\n\nconsidered  to be against the  government itself.\"   Id. at 1279.\n                                                        \n\nThus, the  court concluded that, absent an  alternative basis for\n\njurisdiction,  dismissal for want  of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nwould be required.  See id.6\n                           \n\n          We  agree  with   the  Seventh  Circuit   that  Primate\n                                                                 \n\nProtection League,  logically extended,  mandates that a  federal\n                 \n\nofficer  sued  solely in  his or  her  official capacity  may not\n\nremove a suit  to federal court  under the aegis  of 28 U.S.C.   \n\n1442(a)(1).   In the case  before us, this holding  draws the sap\n\nfrom  the tree:  American's  suit, brought against  Belaga in her\n\nofficial capacity  and seeking no relief  against her personally,\n\nis in reality a suit against the agency.  It  necessarily follows\n\nthat, because EPA itself could not have removed this action under\n\nsection  1442, see Primate Protection League, 111 S. Ct. at 1708,\n                                            \n\nBelaga's  attempt to  remove under  the same  statutory provision\n\nmust fail.\n\n                    \n\n     6In Derwinski  the court  retained jurisdiction  because the\n                  \nplaintiff's action arose  under federal law.  See  Derwinski, 937\n                                                            \nF.2d at 1280; see also 28 U.S.C.    1331, 1441 (1988).\n                      \n\n                                12\n\n                               III\n\n          Notwithstanding  that  this  action was  infelicitously\n\nremoved  under  28  U.S.C.     1442(a)(1)  and  that the  parties\n\nsteadfastly   disclaim  any   independent   basis   for   federal\n\njurisdiction,7 we  inquire whether any other  toehold for federal\n\ncourt  jurisdiction  exists.    Belaga's notice  of  removal  did\n\nmention 28 U.S.C.   1441   a statute which permits removal of any\n\nsuit that originally  could have been brought in  federal court.8\n\nSee, e.g., Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n804, 808 (1986).  Thus, principles of equity, as well as the law,\n\ncompel us  to  explore whether  American's  declaratory  judgment\n\naction  falls  within  the  federal  district  court's   original\n\njurisdiction.  We proceed to run that gauntlet.\n\n                                A\n\n                    \n\n     7The parties' appellate filings ground  removal jurisdiction\nsolely in the officer removal statute.   In answer to our express\ninquiry  anent  jurisdiction,  Belaga  replied  that  the  United\nStates, on her behalf, removed the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \n1442(a)(1) and contended  that such removal was proper.  American\naverred that, apart from the officer removal statute, it was \"not\naware of any other  basis for federal jurisdiction.\"   Nyacol, by\nelecting  not  to participate  in  this  appeal, has  effectively\nconsented to the appropriateness of a state forum.\n\n     8The statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n          Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act\n          of Congress,  any civil  action brought  in a\n          State court  of which the  district courts of\n          the United States have original jurisdiction,\n          may  be  removed  by  the  defendant  or  the\n          defendants,  to  the  district court  of  the\n          United  States for the  district and division\n          embracing  the place  where  such  action  is\n          pending.\n\n28 U.S.C.   1441(a) (1988).\n\n                                13\n\n          In this instance, the presence of original jurisdiction\n\nhinges  upon the existence vel  non of a  federal question,9 that\n                                   \n\nis,  the existence of an action  \"arising under the Constitution,\n\nlaws,  or treaties  of  the United  States.\"   28  U.S.C.    1331\n\n(1988).   Ordinarily, a claim arises under federal law within the\n\nmeaning  of section 1331 if a  federal cause of action appears on\n\nthe face of a well-pleaded  complaint.  See Gully v.  First Nat'l\n                                                                 \n\nBank  in  Meridian,  299  U.S.  109,  113  (1936);  Louisville  &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nNashville  R.R.  v.

Thus,  the underlying causes of  action, howsoever\n\nvisualized, are in the  nature of claims to enforce  an insurance\n\ncontract, the  adjudication of which will  require interpretation\n\nof  various  policy provisions  and contract  terms.   A  suit is\n\ncustomarily deemed to arise under the law that gives birth to the\n\ncause of action.   See American Well Works Co.  v.

Supp. 887, 889\n                                          \n(M.D.  La.  1991)  (dismissing claims  brought  directly  against\ncarrier  because CERCLA \"does not create a direct right of action\nagainst  [PRP's] insurers\");  cf. 42  U.S.C.    9608(c) (allowing\n                                 \ndirect action  against guarantors in limited  circumstances).  It\nis,  therefore,  abundantly  clear  that  American's  declaratory\njudgment complaint  anticipates future coercive actions  that not\nonly will  be entirely governed  by state law,  but also will  be\ninitiated only through state-created mechanisms.\n\n                                16\n\n\"necessarily depends  on resolution of a  substantial question of\n\nfederal  law,\"  Franchise Tax  Bd., 463  U.S.  at 28,  or  when a\n                                  \n\nparallel \"federal  cause of  action completely pre-empts  a state\n\ncause of action,\" id. at 24, the suit is considered a creature of\n                     \n\nfederal law.  We test these waters.\n\n           The  latter proposition  (complete preemption)  can be\n\nsummarily dismissed.   Structurally, CERCLA provides \"no parallel\n\nfederal  cause of action  for the recovery  of insurance proceeds\n                                                                 \n\nfor CERCLA-created liability.\"  Hudson, 957 F.2d at 830.

We  turn, then,  to the former\n\nproposition (necessary dependence on a federal-law question).  \n\n          Conceivably, American might argue that a suit to compel\n\nit  to defend and/or indemnify  its insureds is  one that, though\n\ncreated by  state law, necessarily  turns on federal  common law.\n\nHowever, such an argument  amounts to a call for  the application\n\nof a uniform federal rule of decision to govern interpretation of\n\nan  insurance  policy's  scope   of  coverage  vis-a-vis   CERCLA\n\nliability.  We  decline to heed  that call in  the face of  solid\n\nprecedent  pointing  in  the  opposite  direction.    The  massed\n\nauthority  for  treating insurance  coverage questions  in CERCLA\n\ncases as peculiarly  matters of state law  pervades the courts of\n\nappeals.

Congress has made it\n\nplain that  federal legislation  should rarely be  interpreted to\n\nencroach  on  a state's  regulation  of  insurance.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act,  15 U.S.C.    1012(b) (1988).   Nothing in\n\nCERCLA  suggests  that Congress  intended  to  deviate from  this\n\nregimen.  Indeed,  CERCLA's text not only  envisions the bringing\n\nof  suits  under  state   law  but  specifically  mandates  their\n\nresolution in accordance with that law.   See 42 U.S.C.   9672(a)\n                                             \n\n(stating  that  CERCLA's  insurance subchapter  \"shall  [not]  be\n\nconstrued to affect . . . the law governing the interpretation of\n\ninsurance  contracts of  any State\").   Thus,  CERCLA effectively\n\nrebuts the claim  that its drafters intended to  transform state-\n\n                                18\n\nlaw insurance actions into actions arising under federal law. \n\n          We  think  that  the   situation  at  hand  is  closely\n\nanalogous  to that which confronted  us in Royal  v. Leading Edge\n                                                                 \n\nProds., Inc.,  833 F.2d 1  (1st Cir. 1987).   There, a  plaintiff\n            \n\nsought to recover for breach of  a royalty agreement related to a\n\ncopyrighted work.  In an effort to maintain federal jurisdiction,\n\nhe argued that his  case arose under the federal  copyright laws.\n\nSee id. at 2.  We disagreed, pointing out  that when an action is\n       \n\nbrought  to enforce a royalty  contract the action  arises out of\n\nthe contract and not under the copyright statute, even though the\n\ncontract concerns a copyright.  See id. at 4.  By the same token,\n                                       \n\nan action brought to enforce the pollution-coverage provisions of\n\nan  insurance policy  arises  out of  the  policy and  not  under\n\nfederal  environmental law,  even though  any  potential recovery\n\nunder  the  policy  will satisfy  a  CERCLA-generated  liability.\n\nAccord Hudson, 957 F.2d at 829-30.  In this case, as in Royal, it\n                                                             \n\nwould  be wrong to arrogate unto the federal courts \"jurisdiction\n\nover what  is  essentially a  garden-variety  contract  dispute.\"\n\nRoyal, 833 F.2d at 5.\n     \n\n          In fine, because the insurance dispute which American's\n\ndeclaratory judgment  action anticipates  is a creature  of state\n\nlaw  and  cannot be  said to  arise  under federal  law, original\n\nfederal  question  jurisdiction     and,  by  extension,  removal\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.   1441(a)   does not lie.\n\n                                IV\n\n          Since neither  section 1442 nor  section 1441  supports\n\n                                19\n\nthe removal  of American's declaratory judgment  action, there is\n\nsimply no serviceable  hook on which federal  jurisdiction can be\n\nhung.  We, therefore, go no further. Inasmuch  as the lower court\n\nlacked subject  matter  jurisdiction, its  order  dismissing  the\n\naction against EPA is null.  See Insurance Corp. of Ir., 456 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat 701 (\"The validity of an order of a federal court depends upon\n\nthat court's  having jurisdiction over . . . the subject matter .\n\n.  . .\").     We vacate  the dismissal order and  direct that the\n\ndistrict court reinstate  Belaga, in her official  capacity, as a\n\nparty and  thereafter return the improvidently  removed action to\n\nthe court from whence it emanated.12\n\n          Vacated and remanded with directions.  No costs.\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\n     12We take  no view of Belaga's claims of sovereign immunity,\nnon-justiciability, unripeness  and the  like.  We  are similarly\nnoncommittal  as  to  the  effect,  if  any,  of  remand  on  the\nstipulation  entered into between American and  DEP.  Because the\nfederal  courts  lack  jurisdiction,  all such  matters  must  be\npresented to, and resolved by, the state courts.\n\n                                20\n",

American provisionally undertook\n\nthe company's  defense under  its general  liability policy.   In\n\nDecember of 1991, American brought suit in a Massachusetts  state\n\ncourt seeking a declaration  that it had no obligation  to defend\n\nor recompense its insureds.   In addition to naming  the insureds\n\nas parties  defendant,  American  joined  two  other  defendants:\n\nJulie Belaga,  in her  capacity as EPA'S  Regional Administrator,\n\nand Daniel S. Greenbaum,  in his capacity as Commissioner  of the\n\nDEP.    Invoking  the  officer  removal   statute,  28  U.S.C.   \n\n1442(a)(1),Belaga transferredthe actionto federaldistrict court.2\n\n                    \n\nto the  company and  the individual defendants,  collectively, as\n\"Nyacol\"  or \"the  insureds.\"  We  note, moreover,  that although\nEPA,  invoking a  theory of  successor liability,  notified these\nthree defendants  that they  might be  liable for  EPA's response\ncosts  (past and future), as  well as for  cleanup costs, EPA has\nnot yet sued  to compel payment of these expenses or otherwise to\nenforce its claimed rights.\n\n     2The officer removal statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n               A civil action  or criminal  prosecution\n          commenced in a State court against any of the\n          following persons may be  removed by them  to\n          the  district court of  the United States for\n          the district and division embracing the place\n          wherein it is pending:\n\n                                4\n\n          On  February  20, 1992,  DEP agreed  to  be bound  by a\n\ndeclaration  of  rights  in  American's lawsuit  insofar  as  the\n\njudgment resolves insurance coverage  issues.  The case proceeded\n\nagainst Belaga and the  insureds.  On May 12,  1992, the district\n\ncourt granted Belaga's motion to  dismiss, reasoning that a  suit\n\nagainst  her, in her official capacity, was really a suit against\n\nEPA  and that,  since EPA  had never  sued  Nyacol or  brought an\n\nenforcement proceeding  against it, American could  articulate no\n\njusticiable  controversy  with  EPA.

The\n\ntheme of Primate Protection League, logically extended, serves an\n                                  \n\nesemplastic purpose,  shaping the officer removal  statute into a\n\nrational whole.  In  that case, the Supreme Court  explained that\n\nwhen a suit for monetary damages is brought against an officer in\n\nhis or  her individual  capacity, the complicated  questions that\n\narise as to that officer's immunity support a protective grant of\n\nremoval jurisdiction.  See Primate Protection League, 111 S.  Ct.\n                                                    \n\nat 1708.   By contrast, agencies do  not need the prophylaxis  of\n\nfederal removal because determining an agency's immunity,  unlike\n\ndetermining   an  individual's   immunity,  is   a  \"sufficiently\n\nstraightforward\"  proposition.   Id.    That  rationale  strongly\n                                    \n\nfavors  treatment  of  official-capacity suits  for  purposes  of\n\nremoval in  the same manner as  suits against the agency.   After\n\nall, because a suit  against an officer in her  official capacity\n\ncannot bind the officer personally,  see, e.g., Brandon, 469 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat 471, no issues of immunity can possibly arise that differ from\n\nthose arising in a suit directly against the agency.\n\n          Consistency    is    the   touchstone    of   statutory\n\ninterpretation.  If we were to hold that a suit nominally against\n\nEPA is not removable, as  Primate Protection League demands,  but\n                                                   \n\nthen  go on to hold that a  suit nominally against EPA's regional\n\nadministrator  in her  official capacity    a  suit that  seeks a\n\njudgment  binding on the EPA   is nonetheless removable, we would\n\n                                10\n\nspawn a  glaring interpretive inconsistency and,  in the bargain,\n\nimpugn  the Primate  Court's reasoning.   Given  the identity  of\n                   \n\njuridical interest  that exists  between a government  agency and\n\nits executive officer when the latter is sued only in  his or her\n\nofficial capacity, the  fact that  the agency may  not remove  an\n\naction under  the officer removal statute  compels the conclusion\n\nthat  an official-capacity  defendant is  likewise  disabled from\n\ninitiating   removal   thereunder.5      See   generally  Primate\n                                                                 \n\nProtection  League, 111 S.

If,\nhowever,  a  federal official,  reasonably  believing  himself or\nherself to be sued individually, attempts to remove under section\n1442(a)(1),  any   dispute  as  to  the   officer's  status  will\nnecessarily  be resolved  by a  federal court  in the  context of\nassaying its own  jurisdiction.   See 14A Charles  A.

Thus, our holding that an officer sued\nin an official  capacity may not  remove the  action in order  to\nobtain a  federal forum for  resolution of the  underlying merits\nwill in no way deprive  the officer of access to a  federal forum\nfor  determination of  whether  the suit  is  in fact  an  action\nagainst him or her personally.

Acknowledging\n\nthat,  in  the  aftermath  of Primate  Protection  League,  suits\n                                                         \n\nagainst  federal   agencies  cannot  be   removed  under  section\n\n1442(a)(1), see id. at  1278, Judge Posner wrote that  \"while the\n                   \n\nsuit in this case  is nominally against the Administrator,  it is\n\nagainst   him  in  his  official  capacity  and  such  suits  are\n\nconsidered  to be against the  government itself.\"   Id. at 1279.\n                                                        \n\nThus, the  court concluded that, absent an  alternative basis for\n\njurisdiction,  dismissal for want  of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nwould be required.  See id.6\n                           \n\n          We  agree  with   the  Seventh  Circuit   that  Primate\n                                                                 \n\nProtection League,  logically extended,  mandates that a  federal\n                 \n\nofficer  sued  solely in  his or  her  official capacity  may not\n\nremove a suit  to federal court  under the aegis  of 28 U.S.C.   \n\n1442(a)(1).   In the case  before us, this holding  draws the sap\n\nfrom  the tree:  American's  suit, brought against  Belaga in her\n\nofficial capacity  and seeking no relief  against her personally,\n\nis in reality a suit against the agency.  It  necessarily follows\n\nthat, because EPA itself could not have removed this action under\n\nsection  1442, see Primate Protection League, 111 S. Ct. at 1708,\n                                            \n\nBelaga's  attempt to  remove under  the same  statutory provision\n\nmust fail.\n\n                    \n\n     6In Derwinski  the court  retained jurisdiction  because the\n                  \nplaintiff's action arose  under federal law.  See  Derwinski, 937\n                                                            \nF.2d at 1280; see also 28 U.S.C.    1331, 1441 (1988).\n                      \n\n                                12\n\n                               III\n\n          Notwithstanding  that  this  action was  infelicitously\n\nremoved  under  28  U.S.C.     1442(a)(1)  and  that the  parties\n\nsteadfastly   disclaim  any   independent   basis   for   federal\n\njurisdiction,7 we  inquire whether any other  toehold for federal\n\ncourt  jurisdiction  exists.    Belaga's notice  of  removal  did\n\nmention 28 U.S.C.   1441   a statute which permits removal of any\n\nsuit that originally  could have been brought in  federal court.8\n\nSee, e.g., Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.

Thus, principles of equity, as well as the law,\n\ncompel us  to  explore whether  American's  declaratory  judgment\n\naction  falls  within  the  federal  district  court's   original\n\njurisdiction.  We proceed to run that gauntlet.\n\n                                A\n\n                    \n\n     7The parties' appellate filings ground  removal jurisdiction\nsolely in the officer removal statute.   In answer to our express\ninquiry  anent  jurisdiction,  Belaga  replied  that  the  United\nStates, on her behalf, removed the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \n1442(a)(1) and contended  that such removal was proper.  American\naverred that, apart from the officer removal statute, it was \"not\naware of any other  basis for federal jurisdiction.\"   Nyacol, by\nelecting  not  to participate  in  this  appeal, has  effectively\nconsented to the appropriateness of a state forum.\n\n     8The statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n          Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act\n          of Congress,  any civil  action brought  in a\n          State court  of which the  district courts of\n          the United States have original jurisdiction,\n          may  be  removed  by  the  defendant  or  the\n          defendants,  to  the  district court  of  the\n          United  States for the  district and division\n          embracing  the place  where  such  action  is\n          pending.\n\n28 U.S.C.   1441(a) (1988).\n\n                                13\n\n          In this instance, the presence of original jurisdiction\n\nhinges  upon the existence vel  non of a  federal question,9 that\n                                   \n\nis,  the existence of an action  \"arising under the Constitution,\n\nlaws,  or treaties  of  the United  States.\"   28  U.S.C.    1331\n\n(1988).

See,  e.g., 42 U.S.C.    9607(e)(1)\n                                        \n\n(preserving \"any agreement to insure, hold harmless, or indemnify\n\na  party\" for CERCLA  liability).  We  turn, then,  to the former\n\nproposition (necessary dependence on a federal-law question).  \n\n          Conceivably, American might argue that a suit to compel\n\nit  to defend and/or indemnify  its insureds is  one that, though\n\ncreated by  state law, necessarily  turns on federal  common law.\n\nHowever, such an argument  amounts to a call for  the application\n\nof a uniform federal rule of decision to govern interpretation of\n\nan  insurance  policy's  scope   of  coverage  vis-a-vis   CERCLA\n\nliability.  We  decline to heed  that call in  the face of  solid\n\nprecedent  pointing  in  the  opposite  direction.    The  massed\n\nauthority  for  treating insurance  coverage questions  in CERCLA\n\ncases as peculiarly  matters of state law  pervades the courts of\n\nappeals.

Congress has made it\n\nplain that  federal legislation  should rarely be  interpreted to\n\nencroach  on  a state's  regulation  of  insurance.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act,  15 U.S.C.    1012(b) (1988).   Nothing in\n\nCERCLA  suggests  that Congress  intended  to  deviate from  this\n\nregimen.  Indeed,  CERCLA's text not only  envisions the bringing\n\nof  suits  under  state   law  but  specifically  mandates  their\n\nresolution in accordance with that law.   See 42 U.S.C.   9672(a)\n                                             \n\n(stating  that  CERCLA's  insurance subchapter  \"shall  [not]  be\n\nconstrued to affect . . . the law governing the interpretation of\n\ninsurance  contracts of  any State\").   Thus,  CERCLA effectively\n\nrebuts the claim  that its drafters intended to  transform state-\n\n                                18\n\nlaw insurance actions into actions arising under federal law. \n\n          We  think  that  the   situation  at  hand  is  closely\n\nanalogous  to that which confronted  us in Royal  v. Leading Edge\n                                                                 \n\nProds., Inc.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497011\"><a href=\"/opinion/497011/james-b-royal-v-leading-edge-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1st Cir. 1987).   There, a  plaintiff\n            \n\nsought to recover for breach of  a royalty agreement related to a\n\ncopyrighted work.  In an effort to maintain federal jurisdiction,\n\nhe argued that his  case arose under the federal  copyright laws.\n\nSee id. at 2.  We disagreed, pointing out  that when an action is\n       \n\nbrought  to enforce a royalty  contract the action  arises out of\n\nthe contract and not under the copyright statute, even though the\n\ncontract concerns a copyright.  See id. at 4.  By the same token,\n                                       \n\nan action brought to enforce the pollution-coverage provisions of\n\nan  insurance policy  arises  out of  the  policy and  not  under\n\nfederal  environmental law,  even though  any  potential recovery\n\nunder  the  policy  will satisfy  a  CERCLA-generated  liability.\n\nAccord Hudson, 957 F.2d at 829-30.  In this case, as in Royal, it\n                                                             \n\nwould  be wrong to arrogate unto the federal courts \"jurisdiction\n\nover what  is  essentially a  garden-variety  contract  dispute.\"\n\nRoyal, 833 F.2d at 5.\n     \n\n          In fine, because the insurance dispute which American's\n\ndeclaratory judgment  action anticipates  is a creature  of state\n\nlaw  and  cannot be  said to  arise  under federal  law, original\n\nfederal  question  jurisdiction     and,  by  extension,  removal\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.   1441(a)   does not lie.\n\n                                IV\n\n          Since neither  section 1442 nor  section 1441  supports\n\n                                19\n\nthe removal  of American's declaratory judgment  action, there is\n\nsimply no serviceable  hook on which federal  jurisdiction can be\n\nhung.  We, therefore, go no further. Inasmuch  as the lower court\n\nlacked subject  matter  jurisdiction, its  order  dismissing  the\n\naction against EPA is null.  See Insurance Corp. of Ir., 456 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat 701 (\"The validity of an order of a federal court depends upon\n\nthat court's  having jurisdiction over . . . the subject matter .\n\n.  . .\").     We vacate  the dismissal order and  direct that the\n\ndistrict court reinstate  Belaga, in her official  capacity, as a\n\nparty and  thereafter return the improvidently  removed action to\n\nthe court from whence it emanated.12\n\n          Vacated and remanded with directions.  No costs.\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\n     12We take  no view of Belaga's claims of sovereign immunity,\nnon-justiciability, unripeness  and the  like.  We  are similarly\nnoncommittal  as  to  the  effect,  if  any,  of  remand  on  the\nstipulation  entered into between American and  DEP.  Because the\nfederal  courts  lack  jurisdiction,  all such  matters  must  be\npresented to, and resolved by, the state courts.\n\n                                20\n</pre>",
