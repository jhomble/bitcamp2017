(\"PRFC\"), claims a legal\n\nentitlement  to purchase  debtor in bankruptcy  WPRV-TV, Inc.\n\n(\"WPRV\"  or  \"debtor\").    After much  legal  wrangling,  the\n\ndistrict  court1 denied both suitors.   With the exception of\n\none issue, we affirm the district court's rulings.2 \n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                       \n\n          On  December 3,  1987,  WPRV, a  television station\n\noperating  on channel 13 in  Puerto Rico, filed  a Chapter 11\n\nvoluntary petition  for reorganization  in the United  States\n\nBankruptcy Court  for the Eastern District of  Oklahoma.3  On\n\nApril 4, 1988, Ponce filed a proof of claim for the principal\n\namount  of $4,952,071.    Ponce's claim  was  based on  funds\n\n                    \n\n1.  During the  course of  the proceedings below,  Bankruptcy\nCourt  Judge  Lamoutte,  to  whom this  case  was  originally\nassigned, recused himself. See  infra p. 4.    The district's\n                                     \nother  bankruptcy judge  was  unavailable, and  the case  was\ntransferred to the district court.  \n\n2.  We have previously  held that  when a  district judge  is\nsitting  in lieu of recused bankruptcy  judges, he is thereby\nexercising  the district  court's original  jurisdiction over\nbankruptcy cases,  rather than sitting as  a temporary member\nof the bankruptcy court.  An appeal, therefore, properly lies\nwith this court, pursuant to  28 U.S.C.   1291.  In  Re Plaza\n                                                             \nDe  Diego Shopping Ctr., Inc., 911 F.2d 820, 824-25 (1st Cir.\n                             \n1990)  (citing In Re Manoa  Finance Co., Inc.,  781 F.2d 1370\n                                             \n(9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1064 (1987)). \n                             \n\n3.  According to scant references in the record, the Oklahoma\ncourt was  chosen for WPRV's  bankruptcy proceedings  because\nits  financial records were kept there.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nadvanced under five promissory notes which were guaranteed by\n\nreal  estate  and  chattel  mortgages  on  much  of  debtor's\n\nestate.4  By June 1989,  with prospects for reorganization at\n\na  nadir,  and   pressure  from  creditors   and  lienholders\n\nmounting,   the  Oklahoma   bankruptcy  judge,   sua  sponte,\n                                                            \n\nconverted the case to one under Chapter 7.  The case was then\n\ntransferred  to  the  District  of Puerto  Rico  because  the\n\nmajority of  the  assets relevant  to the  case were  present\n\nthere.   Contemporaneous with  the transfer, Evangelina Vives\n\nwas appointed  operating and liquidating  trustee of debtor's\n\nassets.    Pursuant  to 11  U.S.C.     721,  Vives was  given\n\nauthority to operate the  station until July 31, 1989.   This\n\nauthority was subsequently extended and continues through the\n\npresent  time,  although  at  this juncture  it  appears  the\n\nstation  is   off  the  air.     The   trustee  assumed   the\n\nadministrative  responsibilities of  WPRV, maintaining  it in\n\noperation  ostensibly to preserve  its Federal Communications\n\nCommission (\"FCC\") transmission license and thus its value as\n\na going concern.5\n\n                    \n\n4.  The parties dispute whether,  and to what extent, Ponce's\nclaim is actually secured.  As will be shown, infra, Part II.\n                                                   \nB., we need not resolve that  issue.  Nor is it necessary for\nus  to  address the  district  court's  valuation of  Ponce's\nclaim.\n\n5.  According to statements in the record, if the station had\nremained  off the  air for  a significant  length of  time, a\nstrong  possibility existed  that  the FCC  would revoke  its\ntransmission license,  resulting in  a drop in  the station's\nvalue.  As  the record contains no dispute as to the accuracy\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          On   August   8,  1991,   the   trustee   filed  an\n\n\"informative motion\" reporting that  all efforts to sell WPRV\n\nthrough  a  direct, private  sale  had  failed and  that  all\n\nprospective  offers  had been  withdrawn.   Accordingly,  she\n\nindicated her intent  to sell the station  at public auction.\n\nTo  that  end, on  September 10,  1991,  the trustee  filed a\n\nnotice of  intent  to sell  WPRV  as a  going  concern at  an\n\nauction to be  held on  September 30, 1991.  The notice  also\n\nindicated that  a hearing to  confirm the auction  sale would\n\noccur on October 11, 1991.\n\n          Responding to  the notice  of the auction  sale and\n\nthe  accompanying bidding  instructions, Ponce  delivered its\n\nsealed bid  to the trustee, along with  the required $150,000\n\ndeposit,  on  September  25,  1991,  the  deadline  for  such\n\nsubmissions.   The bid totalled $4.85  million, consisting of\n\nPonce's allegedly secured debt  of $4.8 million, plus $50,000\n\ncash.   In addition to  Ponce, two other  bidders, neither of\n\nwhom had  submitted a prior  written bid or  deposit--both of\n\nwhich were  required by the bidding instructions--appeared at\n\nthe  September 30, 1991,  auction and bid  $1.095 million and\n\n$4.055 million, respectively.\n\n          Despite the  fact that Ponce was  the apparent high\n\nbidder, the trustee did not immediately recommend sale of the\n\n                    \n\nof this scenario, we  accept it without extensive explication\nof federal communication law.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nstation  to it.  Rather, the trustee announced that she would\n\ncontinue accepting offers until  the date of the confirmation\n\nhearing.   On October 4, 1991, Ponce challenged her action by\n\nfiling  a  \"Motion Requesting  Order  To Show  Cause  Why The\n\nOption  (sic)  Held On  September  30,  1991, Should  Not  Be\n\nAdjudicated  To Ponce Federal Bank And To Set Aside All Other\n\nBids Received Contrary To Bidding Instructions.\"\n\n          On October  11,  1991, Bankruptcy  Judge  Lamoutte,\n\nprior  to  conducting the  scheduled  hearing  and ruling  on\n\nPonce's motion, recused himself based on information received\n\nin  a sealed motion filed  by the trustee  the previous day.6\n\n                    \n\n6.  The  trustee's  motion,  simply captioned  \"Motion  Under\nSeal,\"  was later  unsealed by  the district  court.   It was\naccompanied   by  sworn  statements  from  three  men--Norman\nGonzalez  Chacon,  Federico  Rivera Saez  and  Edwin  Alfredo\nGonzalez Rivera--who were involved in PRFC's aborted  attempt\nto purchase WPRV with an auction bid of $6 million.  The gist\nof  the statements  was  that prior  to the  auction, affiant\nGonzalez Chacon contacted Ponce to discuss the possibility of\nPonce financing a  PRFC bid up to the  amount of Ponce's debt\nwith   WPRV.     According  to   Gonzalez  Chacon,   a  Ponce\nrepresentative  dissuaded  him  from  attending  the auction,\nostensibly   for  the   reason   that  his   presence   might\nunintentionally  force  the  bidding higher  than  necessary.\nGonzalez Chacon claims  he was also assured  that Ponce would\nrepresent PRFC's interests at the auction.  When all the bids\nwere lower than that contemplated by Gonzalez Chacon, he went\nback to  Ponce, feeling  that PRFC's interests  had not  been\nprotected.  Gonzalez Chacon reported that he was then told by\na  Ponce representative  that Ponce  was not  going to  allow\nanyone  but itself to  buy WPRV and  \"that if he  were me, he\nwould  not interfere in this  matter because I  would lose my\nmoney,  because the bank would challenge any award.\"  He also\ndetailed threats against the  professional reputation of  the\ntrustee.\n     After  unsealing  the  motion   two  months  later,  the\ndistrict  court referred  its contents  to the  United States\nAttorney's office  for investigation as to  possible criminal\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nThe case was  then, as noted  previously, transferred to  the\n\ndistrict court, which eventually rescheduled the confirmation\n\nhearing  to  November  12,  1991.   Prior  to  that  hearing,\n\nhowever,  on October 24, 1991, the trustee filed a motion for\n\nauthority to  sell certain  property of  the estate  free and\n\nclear of liens, with the existing liens attaching immediately\n\nto the proceeds of the sale in order to protect the equipment\n\nand property interests of the lienholders.  See 11 U.S.C.A.  \n                                               \n\n363(f)(3), (5) (West 1979 &amp; Supp. 1992).  Simultaneously, the\n\ntrustee filed a notice  of private sale, recommending  a sale\n\nto PRFC, whose  representative, Gonzalez Chacon,  had already\n\ntendered  a   $100,000  earnest  deposit  towards  the  total\n\nproposed sale price of  $4.835 million.7  The notice  of sale\n\nitemized the total price into four categories:  real property\n\n($2 million); equipment subject to  Ponce's liens ($280,500);\n\nall   other  estate-owned  equipment  ($300,000);  and  going\n\nconcern value ($2.25 million).\n\n                    \n\nmisconduct.\n\n7.  According to the trustee, Gonzalez Chacon and Rivera Saez\noriginally expressed an interest  in purchasing WPRV prior to\nthe auction,  and were given  the bidding instructions  and a\nsample  Asset  Purchase  Agreement  (APA).     Following  the\nauction,  which  they  did  not  attend,  see  supra note  6,\n                                                    \nnegotiations  concerning  a  private  sale  to  PRFC   began,\nculminating in the PRFC offer.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          At the November 12, 1991,  hearing, Ponce8 objected\n\nto the  PRFC sale for a number of reasons, including the fact\n\nthat it still believed  that it was entitled to  purchase the\n\nstation  as a  result of  its--and no  one else's--compliance\n\nwith the auction procedures.   Ponce stated, however, that it\n\nwould not object to  the PRFC sale provided that it  was made\n\nfor all of the debtor's estate and not on an itemized  basis.\n\nFinally, Ponce  stated  that if  the  itemized sale  were  to\n\nproceed,  it would bid $2 million of its claimed secured debt\n\nfor the equipment subject to its lien which had been itemized\n\non the notice of private sale at a value of only $280,000.  A\n\nPRFC representative  testified that if Ponce  were allowed to\n\npurchase the equipment at  issue, which included transmission\n\ntowers vital  to the  station's operation, it  would withdraw\n\nits bid  entirely.  The  trustee testified that  the proposed\n\nsale  did not include all  of the assets  encumbered by Ponce\n\nliens, and that a large part of  the Ponce collateral was not\n\nbeing  sold.   Finally, the  trustee urged acceptance  of the\n\nPRFC bid because--by bringing in over four million dollars in\n\ncash--the bid would realize the biggest benefit to the estate\n\nand  creditors  as  a whole.    In  contrast,  the Ponce  bid\n\nincluded  just over  two thousand dollars  in cash,  with the\n\n                    \n\n8.  Only Ponce objected to the PRFC sale.  Several creditors,\non the other hand, testified in the sale's favor.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nrest represented by  its credit  claim, the  actual value  of\n\nwhich the trustee disputed. See supra note 4.  \n                                     \n\n          Following  the hearing,  the district  court orally\n\nconfirmed the  sale to  PRFC, overruled Ponce's  objection to\n\nsame, and denied  Ponce's show cause motion  addressed to the\n\nconduct  of the auction.   The judgment from  which Ponce now\n\nappeals was entered  December 18, 1991.   As relevant  events\n\ncontinued  to  occur   after  the   confirmation,  we   defer\n\ndiscussion of Ponce's appeal until a more complete background\n\npicture has been sketched.\n\n          Shortly  after the district court's approval of the\n\nsale to  PRFC, a  multifaceted dispute developed  between the\n\ntrustee and  PRFC, grounded on disagreements as  to the terms\n\nof  the  sale,  the  trustee's  inability  to  determine  the\n\nidentity of PRFC's principals, and  PRFC's apparent inability\n\nto  demonstrate satisfactorily its  financial ability.  Armed\n\nwith  these concerns,  and  following several  failed closing\n\nattempts,  the  trustee notified  PRFC'S  attorney by  letter\n\ndated  December  13,  1991,   that  she  was  cancelling  the\n\nnegotiations   and   forfeiting   PRFC'S  $100,000   deposit.\n\nInitially, both  actions were purported to  be taken pursuant\n\nto provisions of  the auction bidding instructions  requiring\n\nclosing within  thirty days of confirmation,  which had taken\n\nplace November 12, 1991.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          The  trustee claimed  that prior  to the  time that\n\nPRFC made  its purchase  offer, the parties  agreed that  the\n\nterms  of  the APA  and  auction  bidding instructions  would\n\ncontrol the sale.   The  parties had also  agreed on  certain\n\nchanges  to  be made  in the  APA  relative to  deposit, down\n\npayment, and payment of operational expenses between the time\n\nof closing and FCC license transfer.  After the confirmation,\n\nhowever,  the  trustee  claimed  that PRFC's  attorney  began\n\nattacking previously agreed-upon APA provisions.\n\n          Also  troubling the  trustee  was  the  controversy\n\nconcerning  the identity  of the  parties  with whom  she was\n\ndealing.    According to  the  trustee,  Gonzalez Chacon  and\n\nRivera Saez  indicated that  PRFC had been  incorporated, but\n\nduring  negotiations, the  trustee learned  that it  was not.\n\nMoreover,   while   attorney  Carlos   Piovanetti  apparently\n\nrepresented PRFC,  one  partner, Rivera  Saez,  claimed  that\n\nPiovanetti did not represent him.\n\n          Finally, the  trustee indicated  that  some of  the\n\nproof of Gonzalez Chacon's financial worthiness had come from\n\ndocuments in  the name  of his son,  Norman Gonzalez  Rivera,\n\nwhich Gonzalez Chacon had represented as his own.\n\n          On December 20,  1991, responding to the  trustee's\n\nactions, Gonzalez Chacon,  on behalf of PRFC,  filed a motion\n\nseeking  return of  the  deposit and  an order  directing the\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\ntrustee  to  negotiate with  PRFC  under  court supervision.9\n\nEvidentiary  hearings were held  on January 21  and 27, 1992,\n\nfollowing which the court entered an order vacating its prior\n\nconfirmation  of  the  PRFC  sale,  upholding  the  trustee's\n\ndecision to forfeit the deposit,  and allowing the trustee to\n\nresume  her efforts to sell  the station.   PRFC appeals from\n\nthat order.\n\n                    \n\n9.  In  fact, the record indicates that  the trustee tried to\nnegotiate  with  PRFC,  even  after the  December  13,  1991,\ncancellation.  Again, however, no agreement was reached.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA. PRFC Appeal\n              \n\n          In setting aside the  PRFC sale, the district court\n\nendorsed  the trustee's  position, and  found and  ruled that\n\nPRFC  had accepted the APA  and bidding instructions prior to\n\nthe trustee's recommendation of the  sale, and had raised  no\n\nobjections   to   their   terms   until   after  the   sale's\n\nconfirmation.  Thus, the  court ruled, these terms  became an\n\nintegral  part of  the sale  agreement  between PRFC  and the\n\ntrustee,  an agreement  which led  to the  trustee's original\n\nsale   recommendation.    Because  the  bidding  instructions\n\nrequired  the purchaser  to sign  the APA  within 30  days of\n\nconfirmation--an event,  obviously, which did  not occur--the\n\ncourt held that the trustee's cancellation action was proper.\n\nIn addition, based on testimony presented at  two hearings in\n\nJanuary  1992, the  court ruled  that the  trustee's concerns\n\nregarding possible misrepresentations on  the part of PRFC as\n\nto the actual identities of those who would  be in control of\n\nthe  station10 as  well  as their  financial capacity11  were\n\n                    \n\n10.  As we  have previously noted, the  trustee became aware,\nafter  the confirmation  of  the  sale,  that  PRFC  was  not\nincorporated, as  she was led  to believe  it was.   In fact,\nincorporation  did not  occur until  after she  cancelled the\nsale.  As such, the purchase offer had been made  by Gonzalez\nChacon  and Rivera Saez as equal partners, rather than by the\ncorporation.   Later,  during  the January  hearings, it  was\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nwell-founded, and further militated  in favor of vacating the\n\nconfirmation.   With respect  to the deposit  forfeiture, the\n\ncourt relied on  a section of the  bidding instructions which\n\nmandated  automatic   forfeiture   in   the   event   of   an\n\nunconsummated sale.  PRFC now  claims that the district court\n\nerred in  approving the  trustee's action in  terminating the\n\nsale and forfeiting the deposit.\n\n          As an  initial matter,  we note first  the district\n\ncourt's relatively narrow range of discretion  in determining\n\nto set aside its  prior confirmation order.  Matter  of Chung\n                                                             \n\nKing, Inc.,  753 F.2d 547,  549 (7th  Cir. 1985).   While the\n          \n\ncourt  has broad  initial discretion  in granting  or denying\n\nconfirmation, the court may vacate a prior order confirming a\n\n                    \n\nrevealed that Gonzalez Chacon  was facing criminal charges in\nPuerto  Rico.  And, while Gonzalez  Chacon maintained that he\ndisassociated himself from  PRFC, his  signature appeared  on\ndocuments dated  January 28, 1992, that  were later submitted\nto the  court.  The true identity and reputation of the buyer\nwas  especially  relevant, as  the  sale  hinged on  eventual\ntransfer of  WPRV's license  to  the purchaser,  and the  FCC\nconsiders  such factors  in its  licensing decision.   See 47\n                                                          \nU.S.C.A.    307-311 (West 1991).\n\n11.  As a  result of the  concerns created by  the previously\ndescribed   discrepancy  relating  to   the  certificates  of\ndeposit, the district court  ordered PRFC to present evidence\nof  its finances at the  second hearing, held  on January 27,\n1992.   The only evidence presented was the testimony of Juan\nRamon Guzman,  who characterized  himself as a  \"contact\" for\nfour  alleged  investors.   Guzman,  however,  was unable  to\nprovide  any details  as to  the finances  of PRFC,  Gonzalez\nChacon, Rivera Saez, or any other  investor.  Instead, Guzman\ncould testify only as to what he was told by the investors--a\ngroup  of  doctors--as  to  their  interest  and  ability  to\npurchase WPRV.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nsale only in  very limited circumstances  in the exercise  of\n\nits   powers  as  a  court   of  equity.

Here,  given the\n\nuncertainty surrounding PRFC, that principle is outweighed by\n\ncountervailing equities.   Nor would  the bankruptcy  court's\n\nduty to preserve the value of the estate, see M.R.R. Traders,\n                                                             \n\nInc., 788 F.2d  at 818, be fulfilled by a  proposed sale to a\n    \n\nparty     apparently   unable   to   meet  future   financial\n\nobligations,  and which  might face  additional obstacles  in\n\nobtaining  approval of  the  license transfer  from the  FCC.\n\nThus,  we  conclude that  the  district  court's decision  to\n\n                    \n\n12.  A \"grossly inadequate\" sale  price is also an acceptable\nground  for vacating a sale, see Chung King, 753 F.2d at 550,\n                                           \nbut such ground is not a factor in this case. \n\n13.  Although  the district  court described  the conduct  of\nPRFC  and   its  principals   as  fraudulent,  we   need  not\nnecessarily  ascribe evil intent  to PRFC in  order to affirm\nthe lower court's ruling.  Instead, we rest our conclusion on\nthe \"compelling equities\" of the present situation.  However,\nas noted infra, the district  court's partial reliance on the\n              \nthirty-day   provision  in   the  bidding   instructions  was\nerroneous.   Given the other circumstances  surrounding PRFC,\nthis  error  does not  affect  our  conclusion regarding  the\ndecision to vacate confirmation.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nvacate its confirmation of the PRFC sale was not  an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.  \n\n          In  challenging  the  court's forfeiture  decision,\n\nPRFC  argues that  the district court  erred in  finding that\n\nPRFC accepted the terms  of the APA and its  incorporation of\n\nboth the bidding instructions and its forfeiture provision.\n\n          Our standard of review  mandates that we accept the\n\ndistrict court's findings unless they  are clearly erroneous.\n\nMalden Mills Industries, Inc., v.

Findings are not  clearly erroneous\n\nunless \"the reviewing  court on the  entire evidence is  left\n\nwith the firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been\n\ncommitted.\"   Anderson v. City  of Bessemer City,  N.C.,  470\n                                                       \n\nU.S. 564, 573 (1985).\n\n          As  noted  above,  only  the  bidding  instructions\n\nindicate that  the deposit  would be  forfeited  if the  sale\n\nfailed to materialize.  The APA, on the other hand, refers to\n\npossible  forfeiture only of  a later down  payment, equal to\n\nten percent of the purchase price, but is silent with respect\n\nto forfeiture of the deposit at issue.\n\n          The district  court, relying on the  fact that PRFC\n\nhad possession of both the APA and bidding instructions prior\n\nto the confirmation of the sale,  ruled that both were a part\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nof the  sale agreement.   We disagree.  While  the exact date\n\nthat  PRFC received the two documents is unclear, the trustee\n\nacknowledges furnishing  them to  PRFC prior to  the original\n\nauction,  a time  frame  not directly  contradicted by  PRFC.\n\nThis  is consistent with the  position taken by  PRFC that it\n\nwas prepared  to attend the  auction but  for the  dissuasive\n\nrepresentations made by Ponce. See supra note 6.  The trustee\n                                        \n\nfurther stated that she provided PRFC with another set of the\n\nsame documents  following the auction in  order to facilitate\n\nnegotiations,  and that  the  parties agreed  that all  those\n\ndocuments  were part of the overall agreement to sell WPRV to\n\nPRFC.   With respect to  the APA  and notice  of sale,  which\n\nostensibly outlined the  terms and contents  of the   private\n\nsale,  the  record supports  the  trustee's  assertion.   The\n\nbidding instructions, however, are another matter.\n\n          Simply put, there is nothing apparent from the face\n\nof  bidding instructions,  nor anything  else in  the record,\n\nfrom which  one could conclude that  the bidding instructions\n\nare anything  more than that--general instructions related to\n\nbidding  at  the public  auction.    Many  of the  provisions\n\ncontained therein are irrelevant to a private sale, including\n\nthe timing and minimum amount of sealed bids.  Several others\n\ndiffer from the terms of the APA, including the amount of the\n\ndeposit and the time within which the buyer must apply for an\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nFCC   license.14     Moreover,   while  the   APA  explicitly\n\nindicates that the terms of the notice of private sale are to\n\nbecome part  of the APA,  no similar  mention is made  of the\n\nbidding  instructions.    Finally,  we  note  that  the  only\n\nevidence  in the record of an agreement to incorporate is the\n\ntrustee's oft-repeated statement that \"the parties agreed\" to\n\nincorporate  the bidding instructions. Considering the above-\n\ndescribed deficiencies, however, the lack of details or other\n\nevidence of such an incorporation agreement militates against\n\nincorporation.  In sum, the district court's finding that the\n\nauction bidding instructions became  part of the private sale\n\nagreement  does   not  comport  with  the   language  of  the\n\ninstructions,  the APA,  or the  circumstances surrounding  a\n\nprivate sale.  Accordingly, we find that the district court's\n\ndecision to uphold the forfeiture of the $100,000  is clearly\n\nerroneous and must  be reversed.15   Thus, PRFC is  entitled,\n\nnow  that the proposed sale has been cancelled, to the return\n\nof its deposit.\n\nB.  Ponce's Appeal\n                  \n\n                    \n\n14.  The bidding instructions call for a $150,000 deposit and\nFCC  filing within 30 days of confirmation.  The APA reflects\na  $100,000 deposit and mandates FCC filing within 15 days of\nexecuting the APA.\n\n15.  Because  we  reverse  the  district  court's  forfeiture\ndecision  based on  the  \"incorporation\" issue,  we need  not\naddress PRFC's argument that  the trustee's Notice of Private\nSale was legally deficient.\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\n          We note at the outset that Ponce's objection to the\n\nPRFC sale is now moot, as confirmation of the latter has been\n\nvacated.   Ponce's only other  argument is that  it should be\n\nentitled  to  purchase WPRV  because  it  was the  successful\n\nbidder  at the  auction.   We need  look no further  than the\n\nbidding instructions  themselves to  refute this claim.   The\n\ninstructions  clearly state  that the  \"trustee reserves  the\n\nright to, in her sole discretion, . . . (c) reject any or all\n\nbids.\"   This statement plainly dovetails  with the trustee's\n\nstatutory  role as the sole representative of the estate.  11\n\nU.S.C.   323.   Here, where the Ponce bid  would yield little\n\nbenefit to  the estate and  other creditors, the  trustee was\n\nwell within her discretion in not recommending the Ponce  bid\n\nfor  confirmation, and  the  court  correctly denied  Ponce's\n\nmotion.  See  In re Gilbern  Indus. Inc., 526  F.2d 627,  628\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir. 1975)  (\"It is hornbook law that if the highest bid\n\nsubmitted  at a  judicial sale  is manifestly  inadequate, it\n\nneed not  be accepted.\").

With the exception of\n\none issue, we affirm the district court's rulings.2 \n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                       \n\n          On  December 3,  1987,  WPRV, a  television station\n\noperating  on channel 13 in  Puerto Rico, filed  a Chapter 11\n\nvoluntary petition  for reorganization  in the United  States\n\nBankruptcy Court  for the Eastern District of  Oklahoma.3  On\n\nApril 4, 1988, Ponce filed a proof of claim for the principal\n\namount  of $4,952,071.    Ponce's claim  was  based on  funds\n\n                    \n\n1.  During the  course of  the proceedings below,  Bankruptcy\nCourt  Judge  Lamoutte,  to  whom this  case  was  originally\nassigned, recused himself. See  infra p. 4.    The district's\n                                     \nother  bankruptcy judge  was  unavailable, and  the case  was\ntransferred to the district court.  \n\n2.  We have previously  held that  when a  district judge  is\nsitting  in lieu of recused bankruptcy  judges, he is thereby\nexercising  the district  court's original  jurisdiction over\nbankruptcy cases,  rather than sitting as  a temporary member\nof the bankruptcy court.  An appeal, therefore, properly lies\nwith this court, pursuant to  28 U.S.C.   1291.

According to scant references in the record, the Oklahoma\ncourt was  chosen for WPRV's  bankruptcy proceedings  because\nits  financial records were kept there.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nadvanced under five promissory notes which were guaranteed by\n\nreal  estate  and  chattel  mortgages  on  much  of  debtor's\n\nestate.4  By June 1989,  with prospects for reorganization at\n\na  nadir,  and   pressure  from  creditors   and  lienholders\n\nmounting,   the  Oklahoma   bankruptcy  judge,   sua  sponte,\n                                                            \n\nconverted the case to one under Chapter 7.  The case was then\n\ntransferred  to  the  District  of Puerto  Rico  because  the\n\nmajority of  the  assets relevant  to the  case were  present\n\nthere.   Contemporaneous with  the transfer, Evangelina Vives\n\nwas appointed  operating and liquidating  trustee of debtor's\n\nassets.    Pursuant  to 11  U.S.C.     721,  Vives was  given\n\nauthority to operate the  station until July 31, 1989.   This\n\nauthority was subsequently extended and continues through the\n\npresent  time,  although  at  this juncture  it  appears  the\n\nstation  is   off  the  air.     The   trustee  assumed   the\n\nadministrative  responsibilities of  WPRV, maintaining  it in\n\noperation  ostensibly to preserve  its Federal Communications\n\nCommission (\"FCC\") transmission license and thus its value as\n\na going concern.5\n\n                    \n\n4.  The parties dispute whether,  and to what extent, Ponce's\nclaim is actually secured.  As will be shown, infra, Part II.\n                                                   \nB., we need not resolve that  issue.  Nor is it necessary for\nus  to  address the  district  court's  valuation of  Ponce's\nclaim.\n\n5.  According to statements in the record, if the station had\nremained  off the  air for  a significant  length of  time, a\nstrong  possibility existed  that  the FCC  would revoke  its\ntransmission license,  resulting in  a drop in  the station's\nvalue.  As  the record contains no dispute as to the accuracy\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          On   August   8,  1991,   the   trustee   filed  an\n\n\"informative motion\" reporting that  all efforts to sell WPRV\n\nthrough  a  direct, private  sale  had  failed and  that  all\n\nprospective  offers  had been  withdrawn.   Accordingly,  she\n\nindicated her intent  to sell the station  at public auction.\n\nTo  that  end, on  September 10,  1991,  the trustee  filed a\n\nnotice of  intent  to sell  WPRV  as a  going  concern at  an\n\nauction to be  held on  September 30, 1991.  The notice  also\n\nindicated that  a hearing to  confirm the auction  sale would\n\noccur on October 11, 1991.\n\n          Responding to  the notice  of the auction  sale and\n\nthe  accompanying bidding  instructions, Ponce  delivered its\n\nsealed bid  to the trustee, along with  the required $150,000\n\ndeposit,  on  September  25,  1991,  the  deadline  for  such\n\nsubmissions.   The bid totalled $4.85  million, consisting of\n\nPonce's allegedly secured debt  of $4.8 million, plus $50,000\n\ncash.   In addition to  Ponce, two other  bidders, neither of\n\nwhom had  submitted a prior  written bid or  deposit--both of\n\nwhich were  required by the bidding instructions--appeared at\n\nthe  September 30, 1991,  auction and bid  $1.095 million and\n\n$4.055 million, respectively.\n\n          Despite the  fact that Ponce was  the apparent high\n\nbidder, the trustee did not immediately recommend sale of the\n\n                    \n\nof this scenario, we  accept it without extensive explication\nof federal communication law.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nstation  to it.  Rather, the trustee announced that she would\n\ncontinue accepting offers until  the date of the confirmation\n\nhearing.   On October 4, 1991, Ponce challenged her action by\n\nfiling  a  \"Motion Requesting  Order  To Show  Cause  Why The\n\nOption  (sic)  Held On  September  30,  1991, Should  Not  Be\n\nAdjudicated  To Ponce Federal Bank And To Set Aside All Other\n\nBids Received Contrary To Bidding Instructions.\"\n\n          On October  11,  1991, Bankruptcy  Judge  Lamoutte,\n\nprior  to  conducting the  scheduled  hearing  and ruling  on\n\nPonce's motion, recused himself based on information received\n\nin  a sealed motion filed  by the trustee  the previous day.6\n\n                    \n\n6.  The  trustee's  motion,  simply captioned  \"Motion  Under\nSeal,\"  was later  unsealed by  the district  court.   It was\naccompanied   by  sworn  statements  from  three  men--Norman\nGonzalez  Chacon,  Federico  Rivera Saez  and  Edwin  Alfredo\nGonzalez Rivera--who were involved in PRFC's aborted  attempt\nto purchase WPRV with an auction bid of $6 million.  The gist\nof  the statements  was  that prior  to the  auction, affiant\nGonzalez Chacon contacted Ponce to discuss the possibility of\nPonce financing a  PRFC bid up to the  amount of Ponce's debt\nwith   WPRV.     According  to   Gonzalez  Chacon,   a  Ponce\nrepresentative  dissuaded  him  from  attending  the auction,\nostensibly   for  the   reason   that  his   presence   might\nunintentionally  force  the  bidding higher  than  necessary.\nGonzalez Chacon claims  he was also assured  that Ponce would\nrepresent PRFC's interests at the auction.  When all the bids\nwere lower than that contemplated by Gonzalez Chacon, he went\nback to  Ponce, feeling  that PRFC's interests  had not  been\nprotected.  Gonzalez Chacon reported that he was then told by\na  Ponce representative  that Ponce  was not  going to  allow\nanyone  but itself to  buy WPRV and  \"that if he  were me, he\nwould  not interfere in this  matter because I  would lose my\nmoney,  because the bank would challenge any award.\"  He also\ndetailed threats against the  professional reputation of  the\ntrustee.\n     After  unsealing  the  motion   two  months  later,  the\ndistrict  court referred  its contents  to the  United States\nAttorney's office  for investigation as to  possible criminal\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nThe case was  then, as noted  previously, transferred to  the\n\ndistrict court, which eventually rescheduled the confirmation\n\nhearing  to  November  12,  1991.   Prior  to  that  hearing,\n\nhowever,  on October 24, 1991, the trustee filed a motion for\n\nauthority to  sell certain  property of  the estate  free and\n\nclear of liens, with the existing liens attaching immediately\n\nto the proceeds of the sale in order to protect the equipment\n\nand property interests of the lienholders.  See 11 U.S.C.A.  \n                                               \n\n363(f)(3), (5) (West 1979 &amp; Supp. 1992).  Simultaneously, the\n\ntrustee filed a notice  of private sale, recommending  a sale\n\nto PRFC, whose  representative, Gonzalez Chacon,  had already\n\ntendered  a   $100,000  earnest  deposit  towards  the  total\n\nproposed sale price of  $4.835 million.7  The notice  of sale\n\nitemized the total price into four categories:  real property\n\n($2 million); equipment subject to  Ponce's liens ($280,500);\n\nall   other  estate-owned  equipment  ($300,000);  and  going\n\nconcern value ($2.25 million).\n\n                    \n\nmisconduct.\n\n7.  According to the trustee, Gonzalez Chacon and Rivera Saez\noriginally expressed an interest  in purchasing WPRV prior to\nthe auction,  and were given  the bidding instructions  and a\nsample  Asset  Purchase  Agreement  (APA).     Following  the\nauction,  which  they  did  not  attend,  see  supra note  6,\n                                                    \nnegotiations  concerning  a  private  sale  to  PRFC   began,\nculminating in the PRFC offer.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          At the November 12, 1991,  hearing, Ponce8 objected\n\nto the  PRFC sale for a number of reasons, including the fact\n\nthat it still believed  that it was entitled to  purchase the\n\nstation  as a  result of  its--and no  one else's--compliance\n\nwith the auction procedures.   Ponce stated, however, that it\n\nwould not object to  the PRFC sale provided that it  was made\n\nfor all of the debtor's estate and not on an itemized  basis.\n\nFinally, Ponce  stated  that if  the  itemized sale  were  to\n\nproceed,  it would bid $2 million of its claimed secured debt\n\nfor the equipment subject to its lien which had been itemized\n\non the notice of private sale at a value of only $280,000.  A\n\nPRFC representative  testified that if Ponce  were allowed to\n\npurchase the equipment at  issue, which included transmission\n\ntowers vital  to the  station's operation, it  would withdraw\n\nits bid  entirely.  The  trustee testified that  the proposed\n\nsale  did not include all  of the assets  encumbered by Ponce\n\nliens, and that a large part of  the Ponce collateral was not\n\nbeing  sold.   Finally, the  trustee urged acceptance  of the\n\nPRFC bid because--by bringing in over four million dollars in\n\ncash--the bid would realize the biggest benefit to the estate\n\nand  creditors  as  a whole.    In  contrast,  the Ponce  bid\n\nincluded  just over  two thousand dollars  in cash,  with the\n\n                    \n\n8.  Only Ponce objected to the PRFC sale.  Several creditors,\non the other hand, testified in the sale's favor.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nrest represented by  its credit  claim, the  actual value  of\n\nwhich the trustee disputed. See supra note 4.  \n                                     \n\n          Following  the hearing,  the district  court orally\n\nconfirmed the  sale to  PRFC, overruled Ponce's  objection to\n\nsame, and denied  Ponce's show cause motion  addressed to the\n\nconduct  of the auction.   The judgment from  which Ponce now\n\nappeals was entered  December 18, 1991.   As relevant  events\n\ncontinued  to  occur   after  the   confirmation,  we   defer\n\ndiscussion of Ponce's appeal until a more complete background\n\npicture has been sketched.\n\n          Shortly  after the district court's approval of the\n\nsale to  PRFC, a  multifaceted dispute developed  between the\n\ntrustee and  PRFC, grounded on disagreements as  to the terms\n\nof  the  sale,  the  trustee's  inability  to  determine  the\n\nidentity of PRFC's principals, and  PRFC's apparent inability\n\nto  demonstrate satisfactorily its  financial ability.  Armed\n\nwith  these concerns,  and  following several  failed closing\n\nattempts,  the  trustee notified  PRFC'S  attorney by  letter\n\ndated  December  13,  1991,   that  she  was  cancelling  the\n\nnegotiations   and   forfeiting   PRFC'S  $100,000   deposit.\n\nInitially, both  actions were purported to  be taken pursuant\n\nto provisions of  the auction bidding instructions  requiring\n\nclosing within  thirty days of confirmation,  which had taken\n\nplace November 12, 1991.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          The  trustee claimed  that prior  to the  time that\n\nPRFC made  its purchase  offer, the parties  agreed that  the\n\nterms  of  the APA  and  auction  bidding instructions  would\n\ncontrol the sale.   The  parties had also  agreed on  certain\n\nchanges  to  be made  in the  APA  relative to  deposit, down\n\npayment, and payment of operational expenses between the time\n\nof closing and FCC license transfer.  After the confirmation,\n\nhowever,  the  trustee  claimed  that PRFC's  attorney  began\n\nattacking previously agreed-upon APA provisions.\n\n          Also  troubling the  trustee  was  the  controversy\n\nconcerning  the identity  of the  parties  with whom  she was\n\ndealing.    According to  the  trustee,  Gonzalez Chacon  and\n\nRivera Saez  indicated that  PRFC had been  incorporated, but\n\nduring  negotiations, the  trustee learned  that it  was not.\n\nMoreover,   while   attorney  Carlos   Piovanetti  apparently\n\nrepresented PRFC,  one  partner, Rivera  Saez,  claimed  that\n\nPiovanetti did not represent him.\n\n          Finally, the  trustee indicated  that  some of  the\n\nproof of Gonzalez Chacon's financial worthiness had come from\n\ndocuments in  the name  of his son,  Norman Gonzalez  Rivera,\n\nwhich Gonzalez Chacon had represented as his own.\n\n          On December 20,  1991, responding to the  trustee's\n\nactions, Gonzalez Chacon,  on behalf of PRFC,  filed a motion\n\nseeking  return of  the  deposit and  an order  directing the\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\ntrustee  to  negotiate with  PRFC  under  court supervision.9\n\nEvidentiary  hearings were held  on January 21  and 27, 1992,\n\nfollowing which the court entered an order vacating its prior\n\nconfirmation  of  the  PRFC  sale,  upholding  the  trustee's\n\ndecision to forfeit the deposit,  and allowing the trustee to\n\nresume  her efforts to sell  the station.   PRFC appeals from\n\nthat order.\n\n                    \n\n9.  In  fact, the record indicates that  the trustee tried to\nnegotiate  with  PRFC,  even  after the  December  13,  1991,\ncancellation.  Again, however, no agreement was reached.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA. PRFC Appeal\n              \n\n          In setting aside the  PRFC sale, the district court\n\nendorsed  the trustee's  position, and  found and  ruled that\n\nPRFC  had accepted the APA  and bidding instructions prior to\n\nthe trustee's recommendation of the  sale, and had raised  no\n\nobjections   to   their   terms   until   after  the   sale's\n\nconfirmation.  Thus, the  court ruled, these terms  became an\n\nintegral  part of  the sale  agreement  between PRFC  and the\n\ntrustee,  an agreement  which led  to the  trustee's original\n\nsale   recommendation.    Because  the  bidding  instructions\n\nrequired  the purchaser  to sign  the APA  within 30  days of\n\nconfirmation--an event,  obviously, which did  not occur--the\n\ncourt held that the trustee's cancellation action was proper.\n\nIn addition, based on testimony presented at  two hearings in\n\nJanuary  1992, the  court ruled  that the  trustee's concerns\n\nregarding possible misrepresentations on  the part of PRFC as\n\nto the actual identities of those who would  be in control of\n\nthe  station10 as  well  as their  financial capacity11  were\n\n                    \n\n10.  As we  have previously noted, the  trustee became aware,\nafter  the confirmation  of  the  sale,  that  PRFC  was  not\nincorporated, as  she was led  to believe  it was.   In fact,\nincorporation  did not  occur until  after she  cancelled the\nsale.  As such, the purchase offer had been made  by Gonzalez\nChacon  and Rivera Saez as equal partners, rather than by the\ncorporation.   Later,  during  the January  hearings, it  was\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nwell-founded, and further militated  in favor of vacating the\n\nconfirmation.   With respect  to the deposit  forfeiture, the\n\ncourt relied on  a section of the  bidding instructions which\n\nmandated  automatic   forfeiture   in   the   event   of   an\n\nunconsummated sale.  PRFC now  claims that the district court\n\nerred in  approving the  trustee's action in  terminating the\n\nsale and forfeiting the deposit.\n\n          As an  initial matter,  we note first  the district\n\ncourt's relatively narrow range of discretion  in determining\n\nto set aside its  prior confirmation order.  Matter  of Chung\n                                                             \n\nKing, Inc.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446982\"><a href=\"/opinion/446982/in-the-matter-of-chung-king-inc-debtor-appeal-of-michael-t-nigro/\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  549 (7th  Cir. 1985).   While the\n          \n\ncourt  has broad  initial discretion  in granting  or denying\n\nconfirmation, the court may vacate a prior order confirming a\n\n                    \n\nrevealed that Gonzalez Chacon  was facing criminal charges in\nPuerto  Rico.  And, while Gonzalez  Chacon maintained that he\ndisassociated himself from  PRFC, his  signature appeared  on\ndocuments dated  January 28, 1992, that  were later submitted\nto the  court.  The true identity and reputation of the buyer\nwas  especially  relevant, as  the  sale  hinged on  eventual\ntransfer of  WPRV's license  to  the purchaser,  and the  FCC\nconsiders  such factors  in its  licensing decision.   See 47\n                                                          \nU.S.C.A.    307-311 (West 1991).\n\n11.  As a  result of the  concerns created by  the previously\ndescribed   discrepancy  relating  to   the  certificates  of\ndeposit, the district court  ordered PRFC to present evidence\nof  its finances at the  second hearing, held  on January 27,\n1992.   The only evidence presented was the testimony of Juan\nRamon Guzman,  who characterized  himself as a  \"contact\" for\nfour  alleged  investors.   Guzman,  however,  was unable  to\nprovide  any details  as to  the finances  of PRFC,  Gonzalez\nChacon, Rivera Saez, or any other  investor.  Instead, Guzman\ncould testify only as to what he was told by the investors--a\ngroup  of  doctors--as  to  their  interest  and  ability  to\npurchase WPRV.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nsale only in  very limited circumstances  in the exercise  of\n\nits   powers  as  a  court   of  equity.

Here,  given the\n\nuncertainty surrounding PRFC, that principle is outweighed by\n\ncountervailing equities.   Nor would  the bankruptcy  court's\n\nduty to preserve the value of the estate, see M.R.R.

A \"grossly inadequate\" sale  price is also an acceptable\nground  for vacating a sale, see Chung King, 753 F.2d at 550,\n                                           \nbut such ground is not a factor in this case. \n\n13.  Although  the district  court described  the conduct  of\nPRFC  and   its  principals   as  fraudulent,  we   need  not\nnecessarily  ascribe evil intent  to PRFC in  order to affirm\nthe lower court's ruling.  Instead, we rest our conclusion on\nthe \"compelling equities\" of the present situation.  However,\nas noted infra, the district  court's partial reliance on the\n              \nthirty-day   provision  in   the  bidding   instructions  was\nerroneous.   Given the other circumstances  surrounding PRFC,\nthis  error  does not  affect  our  conclusion regarding  the\ndecision to vacate confirmation.\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nvacate its confirmation of the PRFC sale was not  an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.  \n\n          In  challenging  the  court's forfeiture  decision,\n\nPRFC  argues that  the district court  erred in  finding that\n\nPRFC accepted the terms  of the APA and its  incorporation of\n\nboth the bidding instructions and its forfeiture provision.\n\n          Our standard of review  mandates that we accept the\n\ndistrict court's findings unless they  are clearly erroneous.\n\nMalden Mills Industries, Inc., v.

The APA, on the other hand, refers to\n\npossible  forfeiture only of  a later down  payment, equal to\n\nten percent of the purchase price, but is silent with respect\n\nto forfeiture of the deposit at issue.\n\n          The district  court, relying on the  fact that PRFC\n\nhad possession of both the APA and bidding instructions prior\n\nto the confirmation of the sale,  ruled that both were a part\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nof the  sale agreement.   We disagree.  While  the exact date\n\nthat  PRFC received the two documents is unclear, the trustee\n\nacknowledges furnishing  them to  PRFC prior to  the original\n\nauction,  a time  frame  not directly  contradicted by  PRFC.\n\nThis  is consistent with the  position taken by  PRFC that it\n\nwas prepared  to attend the  auction but  for the  dissuasive\n\nrepresentations made by Ponce. See supra note 6.  The trustee\n                                        \n\nfurther stated that she provided PRFC with another set of the\n\nsame documents  following the auction in  order to facilitate\n\nnegotiations,  and that  the  parties agreed  that all  those\n\ndocuments  were part of the overall agreement to sell WPRV to\n\nPRFC.   With respect to  the APA  and notice  of sale,  which\n\nostensibly outlined the  terms and contents  of the   private\n\nsale,  the  record supports  the  trustee's  assertion.   The\n\nbidding instructions, however, are another matter.\n\n          Simply put, there is nothing apparent from the face\n\nof  bidding instructions,  nor anything  else in  the record,\n\nfrom which  one could conclude that  the bidding instructions\n\nare anything  more than that--general instructions related to\n\nbidding  at  the public  auction.    Many  of the  provisions\n\ncontained therein are irrelevant to a private sale, including\n\nthe timing and minimum amount of sealed bids.  Several others\n\ndiffer from the terms of the APA, including the amount of the\n\ndeposit and the time within which the buyer must apply for an\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nFCC   license.14     Moreover,   while  the   APA  explicitly\n\nindicates that the terms of the notice of private sale are to\n\nbecome part  of the APA,  no similar  mention is made  of the\n\nbidding  instructions.    Finally,  we  note  that  the  only\n\nevidence  in the record of an agreement to incorporate is the\n\ntrustee's oft-repeated statement that \"the parties agreed\" to\n\nincorporate  the bidding instructions. Considering the above-\n\ndescribed deficiencies, however, the lack of details or other\n\nevidence of such an incorporation agreement militates against\n\nincorporation.  In sum, the district court's finding that the\n\nauction bidding instructions became  part of the private sale\n\nagreement  does   not  comport  with  the   language  of  the\n\ninstructions,  the APA,  or the  circumstances surrounding  a\n\nprivate sale.  Accordingly, we find that the district court's\n\ndecision to uphold the forfeiture of the $100,000  is clearly\n\nerroneous and must  be reversed.15   Thus, PRFC is  entitled,\n\nnow  that the proposed sale has been cancelled, to the return\n\nof its deposit.\n\nB.  Ponce's Appeal\n                  \n\n                    \n\n14.  The bidding instructions call for a $150,000 deposit and\nFCC  filing within 30 days of confirmation.  The APA reflects\na  $100,000 deposit and mandates FCC filing within 15 days of\nexecuting the APA.\n\n15.  Because  we  reverse  the  district  court's  forfeiture\ndecision  based on  the  \"incorporation\" issue,  we need  not\naddress PRFC's argument that  the trustee's Notice of Private\nSale was legally deficient.\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\n          We note at the outset that Ponce's objection to the\n\nPRFC sale is now moot, as confirmation of the latter has been\n\nvacated.   Ponce's only other  argument is that  it should be\n\nentitled  to  purchase WPRV  because  it  was the  successful\n\nbidder  at the  auction.   We need  look no further  than the\n\nbidding instructions  themselves to  refute this claim.   The\n\ninstructions  clearly state  that the  \"trustee reserves  the\n\nright to, in her sole discretion, . . . (c) reject any or all\n\nbids.\"   This statement plainly dovetails  with the trustee's\n\nstatutory  role as the sole representative of the estate.  11\n\nU.S.C.   323.   Here, where the Ponce bid  would yield little\n\nbenefit to  the estate and  other creditors, the  trustee was\n\nwell within her discretion in not recommending the Ponce  bid\n\nfor  confirmation, and  the  court  correctly denied  Ponce's\n\nmotion.
