Claimant-appellant      Maria      Benavides\n\n(\"Benavides\") appeals from the district court's forfeiture of her\n\nreal property.     Finding no error, we affirm the district court's\n\nruling.\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n           Benavides purchased the property at issue, a three-family\n\ndwelling located at 45 Claremont Street in Central Falls, Rhode\n\nIsland, on March 22, 2001.         The first floor became the residence\n\nfor Benavides, her boyfriend Shawn Montegio (\"Montegio\"), and their\n\nfour children.     The remaining two units were rented to others.\n\n           Despite      Montegio's     relatively    modest   annual   income,\n\nBenavides knew that he consistently had a significant amount of\n\nmoney at his disposal. It was Montegio who provided Benavides with\n\n$19,000 in cash towards her down payment for the property.                  In\n\naddition, Montegio spent $12,000 in renovations to the property,\n\nand he also gave Benavides a $4,400 Rolex watch and most of the\n\n$9,000 that she used to buy a 2000 Ford Windstar.1                   Benavides,\n\nmoreover, was aware that Montegio had served a prison sentence for\n\na drug-related offense.\n\n           In November 2002, law enforcement agents, suspecting\n\nMontegio   of    drug    involvement,    began   monitoring    his    telephone\n\nconversations.          On   January   13,   2003,   agents   intercepted     a\n\n\n     1\n      Benavides only admitted that Montegio gave her most of the\nmoney to buy the Windstar after she was presented with evidence\nthat she could not possibly have purchased it on her modest salary.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fconversation between Montegio and Jorge Ferreras (\"Ferreras\") in\n\nwhich they discussed the sale of cocaine by Ferreras to Montegio.\n\nThe next day, numerous calls pertaining to the sale were monitored.\n\nMany of the calls took place within minutes of one another. During\n\none   call,    Benavides   talked    to    her   cousin,     Jessica    Olivares\n\n(\"Olivares\"), about how best to transport boxes (later determined\n\nto contain cash) to Montegio that Olivares was storing for him at\n\nher   residence.      Benavides     suggested     that,    to   avoid   arousing\n\nOlivares' mother's suspicion, Olivares put the boxes in a bag and\n\ntell her mother that the bag contained clothes for Benavides'\n\nchildren.\n\n              On January 15, 2003, the transaction between Montegio and\n\nFerreras took place.         That evening, a call from Ferreras to\n\nMontegio was intercepted during which Benavides functioned as a\n\nSpanish-English translator for Montegio.           Ferreras complained that\n\n\"135\" was missing, and even though neither Ferreras nor Montegio\n\nhad   mentioned     the   word   \"dollars,\"      Benavides      added   the   word\n\n\"dollars\" to her translation.\n\n              Benavides was also heard in additional intercepted calls\n\nthat concerned drug transactions involving Montegio. For instance,\n\non January 27, 2003, Montegio and Julio Jaiman (\"Jaiman\") spoke\n\nseveral times about a cocaine transaction.                   One minute after\n\nMontegio called Jaiman, he called Benavides and stated, \"that kid\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fwent home.\"       Benavides' response to that statement was simply,\n\n\"okay.\"\n\n            On    February    8,   2003,    a   call    between    Montegio      and\n\nFrancisco Jose Bermudez (\"Bermudez\") was intercepted.                 During the\n\ncall, there was discussion of the purchase by Montegio of nine\n\nkilograms of cocaine.        At one point in the conversation, Montegio\n\nasked Benavides to translate Bermudez's statements from Spanish to\n\nEnglish. Once again, rather than providing literal translations of\n\nBermudez's statements, Benavides, on more than one occasion, added\n\nand subtracted words.        For example, Bermudez said the following to\n\nBenavides:       \"Tell him that if he can give me something ahead, in\n\nadvance, because since it's the new family then you understand me.\"\n\nBenavides translated that statement as, \"He's going to need some\n\nahead because it's the different people that he's dealing with.\"\n\n            On February 9, 2003, shortly after 7:00 p.m., the                 sale\n\nbetween    Montegio    and   Bermudez      occurred    in   the   kitchen   at    45\n\nClaremont Street. During the transaction, which took a little over\n\nan hour, Benavides and her four children remained in the living\n\nroom, a room separated from the kitchen by the dining room.                   From\n\nthe living room, it was not possible to reach the only bathroom in\n\nthe   first-floor     apartment     without     first    passing    through      the\n\nkitchen.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           At about 8:00 p.m., law enforcement agents entered the\n\nfirst-floor apartment.       At trial, two of the agents testified that\n\nthe smell of cocaine pervaded the premises.\n\n           When the agents entered the house, Montegio ran from the\n\nkitchen toward the bathroom, holding a loaded, nine-millimeter gun,\n\nwhich he tossed in the toilet.            In the kitchen, the agents found\n\nthe following:     (1) nine kilograms of cocaine on the toaster oven;\n\n(2) $115,000 in cash on the center island; (3) several kilogram\n\nwrappers in the sink; and (4) a scale and plastic-bag sealer on a\n\ncounter.\n\n           On March 11, 2003, the government filed a complaint for\n\nforfeiture against the property located at 45 Claremont Street. On\n\nApril 21, 2003, Benavides filed her claim to the property.\n\n           On   October    31,    2003,    following      a    bench   trial,   the\n\ndistrict   court   entered    judgment      in    favor   of    the    government.\n\nBenavides filed a timely appeal.                 On appeal, she raises the\n\nfollowing issues: (1) whether the district court erred in finding\n\nthat she was not an innocent owner; and (2) whether the forfeiture\n\nof her home violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth\n\nAmendment.\n\n                         II. INNOCENT OWNER DEFENSE\n\n             Benavides    first   contends       that   the    district    court's\n\nforfeiture order was erroneous because she was an innocent owner.\n\nWhen a district court conducts a bench trial, its factual findings\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fare entitled to \"considerable deference.\" See, e.g., United States\n\nv. 15 Bosworth St., 236 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2001); see also\n\nUnited States v. Iacaboni, 363 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting\n\nthat       \"great   deference\"   is   extended   to   findings   based   on   a\n\ncredibility         determination).          A   district   court's      legal\n\ndeterminations, however, are reviewed de novo.               See, e.g., 15\n\nBosworth St., 236 F.3d at 53.\n\n               To carry its burden in a civil forfeiture action, the\n\ngovernment must satisfy the requirements of both the applicable\n\nforfeiture statute and the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of\n\n2000 (\"CAFRA\"), the relevant portions of which have been codified\n\nin 18 U.S.C. § 983(c).2          The applicable forfeiture statute, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 881(a), provides, in relevant part:\n\n                      The following shall be subject to\n               forfeiture to the United States and no\n               property right shall exist in them:\n                      . . . .\n                      (7) All real property . . . used, or\n               intended to be used, in any manner or part, to\n               commit, or to facilitate the commission of, a\n               violation of this subchapter punishable by\n               more than one year's imprisonment.\n\nMoreover, in a suit or action brought under any civil forfeiture\n\nstatute, § 983(c)(1) states that \"the burden of proof is on the\n\nGovernment to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\n\nthe property is subject to forfeiture.\"           Section 983(c)(3) further\n\n\n       2\n      CAFRA applies to forfeiture proceedings commenced on or after\nAugust 23, 2000. See Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000,\nPub. L. No. 106-185, § 21, 114 Stat. 202, 225.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fprovides that, \"if the Government's theory of forfeiture is that\n\nthe property was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a\n\ncriminal offense, or was involved in the commission of a criminal\n\noffense,   the   Government     shall    establish   that    there   was   a\n\nsubstantial connection between the property and the offense.\"\n\n           Yet, even if the government satisfies the requirements of\n\n§§ 881(a)(7) and 983(c), it does not necessarily follow that there\n\nwill be a forfeiture.      Section 983(d) contains an innocent owner\n\ndefense that provides, in relevant part:\n\n                  (1) An innocent owner's interest in property shall\n           not be forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute. The\n           claimant shall have the burden of proving that the\n           claimant is an innocent owner by a preponderance of the\n           evidence.\n                  (2)(A) With respect to a property interest in\n           existence at the time the illegal conduct giving rise to\n           forfeiture took place, the term \"innocent owner\" means an\n           owner who–\n                       (i) did not know of the conduct giving rise\n                  to forfeiture . . . .3\n\n           In this case, the district court determined that the\n\ngovernment carried its burden of proving that the property in\n\nquestion   was   subject   to   forfeiture   pursuant   to   §   881(a)(7).\n\nBenavides does not question that determination on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Prior to its amendment in 2000, § 881(a)(7) contained its own\ninnocent owner defense.      Although, when the parties and the\ndistrict court refer to the innocent owner defense, they at times\nrefer to the language of the pre-2000 version of § 881(a)(7),\n§ 983(d)'s codification of the innocent owner defense applies in\nthis case, as the forfeiture action was commenced after August 23,\n2000. The error, however, is not determinative.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           At trial, Benavides claimed that she was an innocent\n\nowner.   Although the parties did not dispute Benavides' ownership\n\ninterest in the property, what they disputed was whether she had\n\nknowledge of the event that gave rise to this forfeiture action--\n\nthe February 9 transaction. Benavides, thus, had to prove that she\n\nlacked   knowledge     of    the    transaction    to    be    entitled     to   the\n\nprotections of the innocent owner defense. Benavides relied on her\n\nown testimony to carry her burden.\n\n           The district court ruled that Benavides failed to carry\n\nher burden.     The ruling was based, in large part, on its belief\n\nthat Benavides was not a credible witness.              We find that the trial\n\nrecord sufficiently supports the district court's ruling.\n\n           First,      we    review    the   details     of    the    February     9\n\ntransaction.    The smell of nine kilograms of cocaine would have\n\nbeen impossible for Benavides to miss. In addition, it is unlikely\n\nthat Montegio would have left the cocaine, a scale, a plastic-bag\n\nsealer, kilogram wrappers, and $115,000 in cash in open view in the\n\nkitchen, for a little over an hour, if Benavides had not known of\n\nthe transaction.       The fact that Benavides and her children could\n\nnot reach the only bathroom in the apartment without going through\n\nthe   kitchen   adds    to    the     likelihood   that       she    knew   of   the\n\ntransaction.\n\n           Second, recorded phone conversations pertaining to both\n\nthe February 9 transaction and other drug transactions further\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fsupport the district court's ruling.     Although Benavides testified\n\nthat her participation in those calls was limited to her role as a\n\ntranslator, and that she had no knowledge of the subject matter of\n\nthe conversations, the district court reasonably found that her\n\ntestimony lacked credibility.     Benavides evidenced an awareness of\n\nthe drug-related nature of the conversations in the following ways:\n\n(1) by adding her own thoughts and information to her translations;\n\n(2) by appearing to understand seemingly meaningless words and\n\nphrases; and (3) on one occasion, by arranging to acquire the cash\n\nthat was used to purchase drugs.\n\n            Third, we note Benavides' knowledge of both Montegio's\n\nprior conviction of a drug-related offense and the significant\n\namount of money that he regularly had at his disposal.                  Of\n\nadditional importance is the fact that the district court, in\n\nmaking a credibility judgment, noted that Benavides did not testify\n\ntruthfully about how she obtained the money to buy the Windstar in\n\nher deposition or at trial.\n\n            The burden in this case was not on the government to\n\nestablish    that   Benavides   had   knowledge   of   the   February    9\n\ntransaction; to the contrary, it was on Benavides to establish that\n\nshe lacked knowledge of the transaction. The evidence presented at\n\ntrial adequately supports the district court's conclusion that\n\nBenavides failed to carry her burden.       We, therefore, affirm the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fdistrict court's refusal to allow Benavides to invoke the innocent\n\nowner defense.\n\n                              III. EIGHTH AMENDMENT\n\n                 Benavides next asserts that the forfeiture sought in this\n\ncase violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment to\n\nthe United States Constitution.4           The factual findings made by the\n\ndistrict court in conducting the excessiveness inquiry                   must be\n\naccepted unless clearly erroneous.            United States v. Bajakajian,\n\n524 U.S. 321, 337 n.10 (1998).                The question of whether the\n\nforfeiture here is constitutionally excessive is reviewed de novo.\n\nSee id.\n\n                  In Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602 (1993), the\n\nSupreme Court held that an in rem civil forfeiture action pursuant\n\nto 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(7) was subject to the Excessive Fines Clause,\n\nbut left it for the lower courts to decide what factors should be\n\nused       to    determine   whether   a   forfeiture   is    constitutionally\n\nexcessive.        See id. at 618, 622-23.     Three tests have surfaced for\n\nmaking this determination: (1) the \"instrumentality\" or \"nexus\"\n\ntest,      (2)     the   \"proportionality\"    test,   and    (3)   the   \"hybrid\n\ninstrumentality-proportionality\" test.            See United States v. 221\n\nDana Ave., 81 F. Supp. 2d 182, 190-91 (D. Mass. 2000), vacated on\n\nother grounds, 261 F.3d 65 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. 40\n\n\n       4\n      The Eighth Amendment provides that \"[e]xcessive bail shall\nnot be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual\npunishments inflicted.\" U.S. Const. amend. VIII.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fClark Rd., 52 F. Supp. 2d 254, 267 (D. Mass. 1999); United States\n\nv. 154 Manley Rd., 4 F. Supp. 2d 65, 67-70 (D.R.I. 1998).\n\n               The \"instrumentality\" test focuses on the connection\n\nbetween the alleged wrong and the property subject to forfeiture.5\n\nSee,       e.g.,   221    Dana   Ave.,      81    F.    Supp.     2d     at    190.       The\n\nproportionality test, on the other hand, compares \"the harshness of\n\nthe forfeiture with the severity of the crime.\"                           See, e.g., id.\n\nThe hybrid test, as its name suggests, combines the two.                                 See,\n\ne.g., id.\n\n              In     Bajakajian,          the     Supreme        Court        adopted     the\n\nproportionality          approach    in    a    case    involving        an    in    personam\n\ncriminal forfeiture action.                See 524 U.S. at 333-34.                  The Court\n\nheld that a forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is\n\n\"grossly      disproportional        to     the    gravity       of    the     defendant's\n\noffense.\"          Id.   at   324.    Although         noting    that     \"any       judicial\n\ndetermination       regarding       the    gravity      of   a   particular          criminal\n\noffense will be inherently imprecise,\" the Court looked to the\n\nfollowing in evaluating proportionality: (1) whether the offense is\n\nrelated to other illegal activities; (2) the potential penalties\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      After CAFRA, in order for the government to prove that\nproperty used to facilitate a drug transaction is subject to\nforfeiture, it must prove there is a substantial connection between\nthe property and the crime. See 18 U.S.C. § 983(c)(3). Thus, once\nthe government has met its burden, the instrumentality test is\nsatisfied.\n\n                                           -11-\n\ffor the offense; and (3) the harm caused by the offense.            See id.\n\nat 337-40.\n\n           The Supreme Court has not directly addressed whether the\n\n\"grossly   disproportional\"   standard   applies   to    in   rem    civil\n\nforfeiture actions.    However, in adopting the proportionality test\n\nin Bajakajian, the Court focused on the punitive nature of the\n\nforfeiture at issue, noting that \"the test for the excessiveness of\n\na   punitive     forfeiture   involves   solely    a    proportionality\n\ndetermination.\"    Id. at 333-34 (emphasis added).      And, in applying\n\nthe Excessive Fines Clause to civil in rem forfeiture actions in\n\nAustin, the Court stated that \"the question is not . . . whether\n\nforfeiture under [§ 881(a)(7)] is civil or criminal, but rather\n\nwhether it is punishment.\"    509 U.S. at 610 (emphasis added).        We,\n\nthus, join almost all of our sister circuits in deciding that the\n\npunitive nature of civil in rem forfeitures under § 881(a)(7)\n\nwarrants application of the \"grossly disproportional\" standard to\n\ndetermine whether a forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause.\n\nSee, e.g.,     United States v.

Benavides\n\nlives   at    the     property,   which   has    a    fair   market     value   of\n\napproximately $200,000, with her four young children, and she rents\n\nout the      two    upper-floor   apartments    for    extra     income.    These\n\nfactors, however, are outweighed by Benavides' culpability and the\n\ngravity of the crime giving rise to the forfeiture.\n\n             Benavides was not an innocent owner.              The evidence at\n\ntrial showed that she was directly involved in the February 9\n\ntransaction, as well as several other drug transactions arranged by\n\nMontegio.          See supra.     Moreover,    the    February    9   transaction\n\ninvolved nine kilograms of cocaine, with a wholesale value of\n\napproximately $200,000, and a street value of more than one million\n\ndollars.      The penalty for the crime from which this forfeiture\n\naction arises is high--up to life imprisonment and over four\n\nmillion dollars in fines.

Finding no error, we affirm the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benavides purchased the property at issue, a three-family dwelling located at 45 Claremont Street in Central Falls, Rhode Island, on March 22, 2001. The first floor became the residence for Benavides, her boyfriend Shawn Montegio (\"Montegio\"), and their four children. The remaining two units were rented to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Montegio's relatively modest annual income, Benavides knew that he consistently had a significant amount of money at his disposal. It was Montegio who provided Benavides with $19,000 in cash towards her down payment for the property. In addition, Montegio spent $12,000 in renovations to the property, and he also gave Benavides a $4,400 Rolex watch and most of the $9,000 that she used to buy a 2000 Ford Windstar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Benavides, moreover, was aware that Montegio had served a prison sentence for a drug-related offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2002, law enforcement agents, suspecting Montegio of drug involvement, began monitoring his telephone conversations. On January 13, 2003, agents intercepted a conversation between Montegio and Jorge Ferreras (\"Ferreras\") in which they discussed the sale of cocaine by Ferreras to Montegio. The next day, numerous calls pertaining to the sale were monitored. Many of the calls took place within minutes of one another. During one call, Benavides talked to her cousin, Jessica Olivares (\"Olivares\"), about how best to transport boxes (later determined to contain cash) to Montegio that Olivares was storing for him at her residence. Benavides suggested that, to avoid arousing Olivares' mother's suspicion, Olivares put the boxes in a bag and tell her mother that the bag contained clothes for Benavides' children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 2003, the transaction between Montegio and Ferreras took place. That evening, a call from Ferreras to Montegio was intercepted during which Benavides functioned as a Spanish-English translator for Montegio. Ferreras complained that \"135\" was missing, and even though neither Ferreras nor Montegio had mentioned the word \"dollars,\" Benavides added the word \"dollars\" to her translation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benavides was also heard in additional intercepted calls that concerned drug transactions involving Montegio. For instance, on January 27, 2003, Montegio and Julio Jaiman (\"Jaiman\") spoke several times about a cocaine transaction. One minute after Montegio called Jaiman, he called Benavides and stated, \"that kid went home.\" Benavides' response to that statement was simply, \"okay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 8, 2003, a call between Montegio and Francisco Jose Bermudez (\"Bermudez\") was intercepted. During the call, there was discussion of the purchase by Montegio of nine kilograms of cocaine. At one point in the conversation, Montegio asked Benavides to translate Bermudez's statements from Spanish to English. Once again, rather than providing literal translations of Bermudez's statements, Benavides, on more than one occasion, added and subtracted words. For example, Bermudez said the following to Benavides: \"Tell him that if he can give me something ahead, in advance, because since it's the new family then you understand me.\" Benavides translated that statement as, \"He's going to need some ahead because it's the different people that he's dealing with.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 9, 2003, shortly after 7:00 p.m., the sale between Montegio and Bermudez occurred in the kitchen at 45 Claremont Street. During the transaction, which took a little over an hour, Benavides and her four children remained in the living room, a room separated from the kitchen by the dining room. From the living room, it was not possible to reach the only bathroom in the first-floor apartment without first passing through the kitchen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about 8:00 p.m., law enforcement agents entered the first-floor apartment. At trial, two of the agents testified that the smell of cocaine pervaded the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the agents entered the house, Montegio ran from the kitchen toward the bathroom, holding a loaded, nine-millimeter gun, which he tossed in the toilet. In the kitchen, the agents found the following: (1) nine kilograms of cocaine on the toaster oven; (2) $115,000 in cash on the center island; (3) several kilogram wrappers in the sink; and (4) a scale and plastic-bag sealer on a counter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 11, 2003, the government filed a complaint for forfeiture against the property located at 45 Claremont Street. On April 21, 2003, Benavides filed her claim to the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2003, following a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of the government. Benavides filed a timely appeal. On appeal, she raises the following issues: (1) whether the district court erred in finding that she was not an innocent owner; and (2) whether the forfeiture of her home violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. INNOCENT OWNER DEFENSE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benavides first contends that the district court's forfeiture order was erroneous because she was an innocent owner. When a district court conducts a bench trial, its factual findings are entitled to \"considerable deference.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v. 15 Bosworth St.,</i> 236 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also United States v. Iacaboni,</i> 363 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that \"great deference\" is extended to findings based on a credibility determination). A district court's legal determinations, however, are reviewed <i>de novo. See, e.g., 15 Bosworth St.,</i> 236 F.3d at 53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To carry its burden in a civil forfeiture action, the government must satisfy the requirements of both the applicable forfeiture statute and the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (\"CAFRA\"), the relevant portions of which have been codified in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 983(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The applicable forfeiture statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(a), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States and no property right shall exist in them:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(7) All real property ... used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, a violation of this subchapter punishable by more than one year's imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in a suit or action brought under any civil forfeiture statute, &#167; 983(c)(1) states that \"the burden of proof is on the Government to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the property is subject to forfeiture.\" Section 983(c)(3) further provides that, \"if the Government's theory of forfeiture is that the property was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a criminal offense, or was involved in the commission of a criminal offense, the Government shall establish that there was a substantial connection between the property and the offense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, even if the government satisfies the requirements of &#167;&#167; 881(a)(7) and 983(c), it does not necessarily follow that there will be a forfeiture. Section 983(d) contains an innocent owner defense that provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) An innocent owner's interest in property shall not be forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute. The claimant shall have the burden of proving that the claimant is an innocent owner by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2)(A) With respect to a property interest in existence at the time the illegal conduct giving rise to forfeiture took place, the term \"innocent owner\" means an owner who &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) did not know of the conduct giving rise to forfeiture....<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court determined that the government carried its burden of proving that the property in question was subject to forfeiture pursuant to &#167; 881(a)(7). Benavides does not question that determination on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Benavides claimed that she was an innocent owner. Although the parties did not dispute Benavides' ownership interest in the property, what they disputed was whether she had knowledge of the event that gave rise to this forfeiture action &#8212; the February 9 transaction. Benavides, thus, had to prove that she lacked knowledge of the transaction to be entitled to the protections of the innocent owner defense. Benavides relied on her own testimony to carry her burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Benavides failed to carry her burden. The ruling was based, in large part, on its belief that Benavides was not a credible witness. We find that the trial record sufficiently supports the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we review the details of the February 9 transaction. The smell of nine kilograms of cocaine would have been impossible for Benavides to miss. In addition, it is unlikely that Montegio would have left the cocaine, a scale, a plastic-bag sealer, kilogram wrappers, and $115,000 in cash in open view in the kitchen, for a little over an hour, if Benavides had not known of the transaction. The fact that Benavides and her children could not reach the only bathroom in the apartment without going through the kitchen adds to the likelihood that she knew of the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, recorded phone conversations pertaining to both the February 9 transaction and other drug transactions further support the district court's ruling. Although Benavides testified that her participation in those calls was limited to her role as a translator, and that she had no knowledge of the subject matter of the conversations, the district court reasonably found that her testimony lacked credibility. Benavides evidenced an awareness of the drug-related nature of the conversations in the following ways: (1) by adding her own thoughts and information to her translations; (2) by appearing to understand seemingly meaningless words and phrases; and (3) on one occasion, by arranging to acquire the cash that was used to purchase drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, we note Benavides' knowledge of both Montegio's prior conviction of a drug-related offense and the significant amount of money that he regularly had at his disposal. Of additional importance is the fact that the district court, in making a credibility judgment, noted that Benavides did not testify truthfully about how she obtained the money to buy the Windstar in her deposition or at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden in this case was not on the government to establish that Benavides had knowledge of the February 9 transaction; to the contrary, it was on Benavides to establish that she lacked knowledge of the transaction. The evidence presented at trial adequately supports the district court's conclusion that Benavides failed to carry her burden. We, therefore, affirm the district court's refusal to allow Benavides to invoke the innocent owner defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. EIGHTH AMENDMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benavides next asserts that the forfeiture sought in this case violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The factual findings made by the district court in conducting the excessiveness inquiry must be accepted unless clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. 321, 337 n. 10, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998). The question of whether the forfeiture here is constitutionally excessive is reviewed <i>de novo. See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Austin v. United States,</i> 509 U.S. 602, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993), the Supreme Court held that an <i>in rem</i> civil forfeiture action pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(a)(7) was subject to the Excessive Fines Clause, but left it for the lower courts to decide what factors should be used to determine whether a forfeiture is constitutionally excessive. <i>See id.</i> at 618, 622-23. Three tests have surfaced for making this determination: (1) the \"instrumentality\" or \"nexus\" test, (2) the \"proportionality\" test, and (3) the \"hybrid instrumentality-proportionality\" test. <i>See United States v. 221 Dana Ave.,</i> 81 F.Supp.2d 182, 190-91 (D.Mass.2000), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> 261 F.3d 65 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. 40 Clark Rd.,</i> 52 F.Supp.2d 254, 267 (D.Mass.1999); <i>United States v. 154 Manley Rd.,</i> 4 F.Supp.2d 65, 67-70 (D.R.I.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"instrumentality\" test focuses on the connection between the alleged wrong and the property subject to forfeiture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See, e.g., 221 Dana Ave.,</i> 81 F.Supp.2d at 190. The proportionality test, on the other hand, compares \"the harshness of the forfeiture with the severity of the crime.\" <i>See, e.g., id.</i> The hybrid test, as its name suggests, combines the two. <i>See, e.g., id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Bajakajian,</i> the Supreme Court adopted the proportionality approach in a case involving an <i>in personam</i> criminal forfeiture action. <i>See</i> 524 U.S. at 333-34. The Court held that a forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant's offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 324. Although noting that \"any judicial determination regarding the gravity of a particular criminal offense will be inherently imprecise,\" the Court looked to the following in evaluating proportionality: (1) whether the offense is related to other illegal activities; (2) the potential penalties for the offense; and (3) the harm caused by the offense. <i>See id.</i> at 337-40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has not directly addressed whether the \"grossly disproportional\" standard applies to <i>in rem</i> civil forfeiture actions. However, in adopting the proportionality test in <i>Bajakajian,</i> the Court focused on the punitive nature of the forfeiture at issue, noting that \"the test for the excessiveness of a <i>punitive</i> forfeiture involves solely a proportionality determination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 333-34 (emphasis added). And, in applying the Excessive Fines Clause to civil <i>in rem</i> forfeiture actions in <i>Austin,</i> the Court stated that \"the question is not ... whether forfeiture under [&#167; 881(a)(7)] is civil or criminal, but rather whether it is <i>punishment.</i>\" 509 U.S. at 610 (emphasis added). We, thus, join almost all of our sister circuits in deciding that the punitive nature of civil <i>in rem</i> forfeitures under &#167; 881(a)(7) warrants application of the \"grossly disproportional\" standard to determine whether a forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Collado,</i> 348 F.3d 323, 328 (2d Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Wagoner County Real Estate,</i> 278 F.3d 1091, 1099-100 (10th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Ahmad,</i> 213 F.3d 805, 816 n. 4 (4th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 531 U.S. 1014, 121 S.Ct. 573, 148 L.Ed.2d 490 (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, the question is whether the harshness of the forfeiture is grossly disproportional to the gravity of the crime. Here, the harshness of the forfeiture is significant. Benavides lives at the property, which has a fair market value of approximately $200,000, with her four young children, and she rents out the two upper-floor apartments for extra income. These factors, however, are outweighed by Benavides' culpability and the gravity of the crime giving rise to the forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benavides was not an innocent owner. The evidence at trial showed that she was directly involved in the February 9 transaction, as well as several other drug transactions arranged by Montegio. <i>See supra.</i> Moreover, the February 9 transaction involved nine kilograms of cocaine, with a wholesale value of approximately $200,000, and a street value of more than one million dollars.

Finding no error, we affirm the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benavides purchased the property at issue, a three-family dwelling located at 45 Claremont Street in Central Falls, Rhode Island, on March 22, 2001. The first floor became the residence for Benavides, her boyfriend Shawn Montegio (\"Montegio\"), and their four children. The remaining two units were rented to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Montegio's relatively modest annual income, Benavides knew that he consistently had a significant amount of money at his disposal. It was Montegio who provided Benavides with $19,000 in cash towards her down payment for the property. In addition, Montegio spent $12,000 in renovations to the property, and he also gave Benavides a $4,400 Rolex watch and most of the $9,000 that she used to buy a 2000 Ford Windstar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Benavides, moreover, was aware that Montegio had served a prison sentence for a drug-related offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2002, law enforcement agents, suspecting Montegio of drug involvement, began monitoring his telephone conversations. On January 13, 2003, agents intercepted a conversation between Montegio and Jorge Ferreras (\"Ferreras\") in which they discussed the sale of cocaine by Ferreras to Montegio. The next day, numerous calls pertaining to the sale were monitored. Many of the calls took place within minutes of one another. During one call, Benavides talked to her cousin, Jessica Olivares (\"Olivares\"), about how best to transport boxes (later determined to contain cash) to Montegio that Olivares was storing for him at her residence. Benavides suggested that, to avoid arousing Olivares' mother's suspicion, Olivares put the boxes in a bag and tell her mother that the bag contained clothes for Benavides' children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 2003, the transaction between Montegio and Ferreras took place. That evening, a call from Ferreras to Montegio was intercepted during which Benavides functioned as a Spanish-English translator for Montegio. Ferreras complained that \"135\" was missing, and even though neither Ferreras nor Montegio had mentioned the word \"dollars,\" Benavides added the word \"dollars\" to her translation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benavides was also heard in additional intercepted calls that concerned drug transactions involving Montegio. For instance, on January 27, 2003, Montegio and Julio Jaiman (\"Jaiman\") spoke several times about a cocaine transaction. One minute after Montegio called Jaiman, he called Benavides and stated, \"that kid went home.\" Benavides' response to that statement was simply, \"okay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 8, 2003, a call between Montegio and Francisco Jose Bermudez (\"Bermudez\") was intercepted. During the call, there was discussion of the purchase by Montegio of nine kilograms of cocaine. At one point in the conversation, Montegio asked Benavides to translate Bermudez's statements from Spanish to English. Once again, rather than providing literal translations of Bermudez's statements, Benavides, on more than one occasion, added and subtracted words. For example, Bermudez said the following to Benavides: \"Tell him that if he can give me something ahead, in advance, because since it's the new family then you understand me.\" Benavides translated that statement as, \"He's going to need some ahead because it's the different people that he's dealing with.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 9, 2003, shortly after 7:00 p.m., the sale between Montegio and Bermudez occurred in the kitchen at 45 Claremont Street. During the transaction, which took a little over an hour, Benavides and her four children remained in the living room, a room separated from the kitchen by the dining room. From the living room, it was not possible to reach the only bathroom in the first-floor apartment without first passing through the kitchen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about 8:00 p.m., law enforcement agents entered the first-floor apartment. At trial, two of the agents testified that the smell of cocaine pervaded the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the agents entered the house, Montegio ran from the kitchen toward the bathroom, holding a loaded, nine-millimeter gun, which he tossed in the toilet. In the kitchen, the agents found the following: (1) nine kilograms of cocaine on the toaster oven; (2) $115,000 in cash on the center island; (3) several kilogram wrappers in the sink; and (4) a scale and plastic-bag sealer on a counter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 11, 2003, the government filed a complaint for forfeiture against the property located at 45 Claremont Street. On April 21, 2003, Benavides filed her claim to the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2003, following a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of the government. Benavides filed a timely appeal. On appeal, she raises the following issues: (1) whether the district court erred in finding that she was not an innocent owner; and (2) whether the forfeiture of her home violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. INNOCENT OWNER DEFENSE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benavides first contends that the district court's forfeiture order was erroneous because she was an innocent owner. When a district court conducts a bench trial, its factual findings are entitled to \"considerable deference.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v. 15 Bosworth St.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199222\"><a href=\"/opinion/199222/united-states-v-15-bosworth-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also United States v.

A district court's legal determinations, however, are reviewed <i>de novo. See, e.g., 15 Bosworth St.,</i> 236 F.3d at 53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To carry its burden in a civil forfeiture action, the government must satisfy the requirements of both the applicable forfeiture statute and the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (\"CAFRA\"), the relevant portions of which have been codified in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 983(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The applicable forfeiture statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(a), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States and no property right shall exist in them:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(7) All real property ... used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, a violation of this subchapter punishable by more than one year's imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in a suit or action brought under any civil forfeiture statute, &#167; 983(c)(1) states that \"the burden of proof is on the Government to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the property is subject to forfeiture.\" Section 983(c)(3) further provides that, \"if the Government's theory of forfeiture is that the property was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a criminal offense, or was involved in the commission of a criminal offense, the Government shall establish that there was a substantial connection between the property and the offense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, even if the government satisfies the requirements of &#167;&#167; 881(a)(7) and 983(c), it does not necessarily follow that there will be a forfeiture. Section 983(d) contains an innocent owner defense that provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) An innocent owner's interest in property shall not be forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute. The claimant shall have the burden of proving that the claimant is an innocent owner by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2)(A) With respect to a property interest in existence at the time the illegal conduct giving rise to forfeiture took place, the term \"innocent owner\" means an owner who &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) did not know of the conduct giving rise to forfeiture....<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court determined that the government carried its burden of proving that the property in question was subject to forfeiture pursuant to &#167; 881(a)(7). Benavides does not question that determination on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Benavides claimed that she was an innocent owner. Although the parties did not dispute Benavides' ownership interest in the property, what they disputed was whether she had knowledge of the event that gave rise to this forfeiture action &#8212; the February 9 transaction. Benavides, thus, had to prove that she lacked knowledge of the transaction to be entitled to the protections of the innocent owner defense. Benavides relied on her own testimony to carry her burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Benavides failed to carry her burden. The ruling was based, in large part, on its belief that Benavides was not a credible witness. We find that the trial record sufficiently supports the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we review the details of the February 9 transaction. The smell of nine kilograms of cocaine would have been impossible for Benavides to miss. In addition, it is unlikely that Montegio would have left the cocaine, a scale, a plastic-bag sealer, kilogram wrappers, and $115,000 in cash in open view in the kitchen, for a little over an hour, if Benavides had not known of the transaction. The fact that Benavides and her children could not reach the only bathroom in the apartment without going through the kitchen adds to the likelihood that she knew of the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, recorded phone conversations pertaining to both the February 9 transaction and other drug transactions further support the district court's ruling. Although Benavides testified that her participation in those calls was limited to her role as a translator, and that she had no knowledge of the subject matter of the conversations, the district court reasonably found that her testimony lacked credibility. Benavides evidenced an awareness of the drug-related nature of the conversations in the following ways: (1) by adding her own thoughts and information to her translations; (2) by appearing to understand seemingly meaningless words and phrases; and (3) on one occasion, by arranging to acquire the cash that was used to purchase drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, we note Benavides' knowledge of both Montegio's prior conviction of a drug-related offense and the significant amount of money that he regularly had at his disposal. Of additional importance is the fact that the district court, in making a credibility judgment, noted that Benavides did not testify truthfully about how she obtained the money to buy the Windstar in her deposition or at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden in this case was not on the government to establish that Benavides had knowledge of the February 9 transaction; to the contrary, it was on Benavides to establish that she lacked knowledge of the transaction. The evidence presented at trial adequately supports the district court's conclusion that Benavides failed to carry her burden. We, therefore, affirm the district court's refusal to allow Benavides to invoke the innocent owner defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. EIGHTH AMENDMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benavides next asserts that the forfeiture sought in this case violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The factual findings made by the district court in conducting the excessiveness inquiry must be accepted unless clearly erroneous. <i>United States v.

The proportionality test, on the other hand, compares \"the harshness of the forfeiture with the severity of the crime.\" <i>See, e.g., id.</i> The hybrid test, as its name suggests, combines the two. <i>See, e.g., id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Bajakajian,</i> the Supreme Court adopted the proportionality approach in a case involving an <i>in personam</i> criminal forfeiture action. <i>See</i> 524 U.S. at 333-34. The Court held that a forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant's offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 324. Although noting that \"any judicial determination regarding the gravity of a particular criminal offense will be inherently imprecise,\" the Court looked to the following in evaluating proportionality: (1) whether the offense is related to other illegal activities; (2) the potential penalties for the offense; and (3) the harm caused by the offense. <i>See id.</i> at 337-40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has not directly addressed whether the \"grossly disproportional\" standard applies to <i>in rem</i> civil forfeiture actions. However, in adopting the proportionality test in <i>Bajakajian,</i> the Court focused on the punitive nature of the forfeiture at issue, noting that \"the test for the excessiveness of a <i>punitive</i> forfeiture involves solely a proportionality determination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 333-34 (emphasis added). And, in applying the Excessive Fines Clause to civil <i>in rem</i> forfeiture actions in <i>Austin,</i> the Court stated that \"the question is not ... whether forfeiture under [&#167; 881(a)(7)] is civil or criminal, but rather whether it is <i>punishment.</i>\" 509 U.S. at 610 (emphasis added). We, thus, join almost all of our sister circuits in deciding that the punitive nature of civil <i>in rem</i> forfeitures under &#167; 881(a)(7) warrants application of the \"grossly disproportional\" standard to determine whether a forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Here, the harshness of the forfeiture is significant. Benavides lives at the property, which has a fair market value of approximately $200,000, with her four young children, and she rents out the two upper-floor apartments for extra income. These factors, however, are outweighed by Benavides' culpability and the gravity of the crime giving rise to the forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benavides was not an innocent owner. The evidence at trial showed that she was directly involved in the February 9 transaction, as well as several other drug transactions arranged by Montegio. <i>See supra.</i> Moreover, the February 9 transaction involved nine kilograms of cocaine, with a wholesale value of approximately $200,000, and a street value of more than one million dollars. The penalty for the crime from which this forfeiture action arises is high &#8212; up to life imprisonment and over four million dollars in fines. The harshness of the forfeiture is not \"grossly disproportional\" to the gravity of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Benavides only admitted that Montegio gave her most of the money to buy the Windstar after she was presented with evidence that she could not possibly have purchased it on her modest salary</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> CAFRA applies to forfeiture proceedings commenced on or after August 23, 2000<i>See</i> Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, Pub.L.
