Cleveland  Bd. of  Educ. v.\n                                                         \n\nLoudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985).  The district court entered\n          \n\nan injunction ordering  the Company to reinstate her, and it\n\ndenied  the  individual  defendants'  claims  of  \"qualified\n\nimmunity.\"  The defendants appeal these orders.  28 U.S.C.  \n\n1291; Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985).  We affirm. \n                         \n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          Ms.   Laborde  is   a   career  employee   of  the\n\nCommonwealth-owned Telephone  Company, where she  has worked\n\nsince 1975.   On July 7,  1986, she was  injured in a  work-\n\nrelated auto accident.  She received treatment  at the State\n\nInsurance  Fund.   One  year later,  on  July 6,  1987,  she\n\nreturned to work.  Fourteen months  after that, on September\n\n7,  1988, Ms. Laborde went  back to the  Fund for treatment.\n\nIn early October (the following  month) the Company wrote to\n\nMs. Laborde to tell  her that it was dismissing  her because\n\nof absences related to her \"prolonged illness.\" \n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\n          Ms. Laborde, almost  immediately thereafter,  told\n\nCompany  officials that they had made a mistake.  Her latest\n\ntreatment  at the Fund (in  September) was not  related to a\n\n\"prolonged illness.\"   Rather, she said,  the treatment (and\n\nher  absence from  work)  resulted from  a new  work-related\n\naccident, involving moving boxes. That accident had occurred\n\nin  August   1988,  only  two  months   before  her  current\n\ntreatment.\n\n          This \"mistake\" seemed important, for Puerto Rico's\n\nworkers' compensation law requires  an employer to \"reserve\"\n\nthe job of  an injured employee undergoing treatment  at the\n\nFund,  and to \"reinstate\" the employee in that job, but only\n\nif, inter alia, at the time the worker seeks  reinstatement,\n              \n\nno more than \"twelve months\" have  \"lapse[d] . . . from  the\n                           \n\ndate of the  accident.\" P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 11,    7.  (See\n\nAppendix for  complete text  of statutory provision).   More\n\nthan \"twelve months\" had \"lapse[d]\" from Ms. Laborde's first\n\naccident; but only two  months had \"lapse[d]\" from the  time\n\nof the second. \n\n          The Company, either because it did not believe Ms.\n\nLaborde, or  because it  thought her  factual claim  made no\n\ndifference, neither  changed its  mind  about dismissal  nor\n\ngranted Ms. Laborde a hearing at which she could dispute the\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nbasis for  her dismissal.  Ms.  Laborde subsequently brought\n\nthis lawsuit.  She  claimed that the Company, in  effect, by\n\ndepriving  her of her job without any kind of prior hearing,\n\nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  The\n\ndistrict court held that Ms. Laborde was correct.  We agree.\n\n                             II\n\n                          The Law \n                                 \n\n          Like the district court, we find the law clear and\n\nin Ms. Laborde's favor.  The  Fourteenth Amendment says that\n\nthe  Commonwealth  may not  deprive  a  person of  \"property\n\nwithout due process  of law.\"   The Supreme  Court has  made\n\nclear  that  \"property\" includes  the  job  of a  government\n\nemployee who  (under local  law) cannot be  dismissed except\n\nfor  \"good cause.\"  Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 538-39; see also\n                                                            \n\nKercado-Melendez  v. Aponte-Roque,  829 F.2d  255,  262 (1st\n                                 \n\nCir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1044 (1988).  The Supreme\n                        \n\nCourt has also  made clear  that the process  \"due\" such  an\n\nemployee normally includes  \"'some kind of hearing' prior to\n\n. . . discharge.\"  Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542.  The parties\n                             \n\nhere  agree that  the  Puerto Rico  Telephone  Company is  a\n\ngovernment employer,  Kauffman v. Puerto Rico  Tel. Co., 841\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 1169, 1173 (1st Cir. 1987), and that it can dismiss Ms.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nLaborde, a permanent  employee, only for  cause.  P.R.  Laws\n\nAnn.,   tit.  3,     1336(4).    The  Company,  through  its\n\nofficials, has  told Ms. Laborde  that she cannot  return to\n\nwork.  They did not, and have not yet, provided her with any\n\nsignificant  opportunity for  a hearing.   Hence,  they have\n\ndeprived her  of \"property\"  without the \"process\"  that the\n\nFederal Constitution requires.  Loudermill, 470 U.S at 546.\n                                          \n\n          The   defendants  make  three   arguments  to  the\n\ncontrary.   First, they say  that, under Puerto  Rico's law,\n\nMs. Laborde  lost her job  when she did not  appear at work;\n\nthe workmen's compensation statute  provides only a right to\n\n\"reinstatement\" (after an  absence caused  by a  job-related\n\ninjury).    The Federal  Constitution,  they  add, does  not\n\nprotect rights to \"reinstatement\" because such  'rights' are\n\nonly expectations  of employment, which  may or  may not  be\n\nfulfilled.  See Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564,  576\n                                        \n\n(1972) (due process clause \"is  a safeguard of the  security\n\nof interests  that person  has already acquired  in specific\n\nbenefits\"); cf.  Kauffman, 841 F.2d  at 1173 (where employee\n                         \n\nis illegally  hired, property  right in employment  is never\n\ncreated).\n\n           As  a matter  of Commonwealth law,  however, this\n\nargument  seems  wrong,  for  the statute  itself  does  not\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nseparate \"discharge\" from \"reinstatement;\" rather, it speaks\n\nboth of \"reserv[ing]\" the job of an employee under treatment\n\nand   \"reinstat[ing]\"   that   employee   (under   specified\n\nconditions) on request.   See P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 11,    7;\n                             \n\nCarron-Lamoutte v. Tourism  Co. of Puerto Rico,  92 J.T.S 97\n                                              \n\n(1992); In Re  Hotel Da  Vinci, Inc., 797  F.2d 33, 35  (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1986), citing Rojas v. Mendez &amp; Co., 84 J.T.S. 3 (1984)\n                                        \n\n(employer cannot validly discharge employee missing work due\n\nto  medical treatment  during twelve-month  period following\n\ndisability); but see Union Tronquistas de Puerto Rico, Local\n                                                            \n\n901 v. Emery Air Freight Corp., 596 F.Supp. 829, 833 (D.P.R.\n                              \n\n1984)  (referring  to  separate  steps  of  \"discharge\"  and\n\n\"reinstatement\").  \n\n          Regardless,  as  a  matter  of  federal  law,  the\n\nargument is wrong because the workmen's compensation statute\n\nso  narrows  the  government's   discretion  to  refuse   to\n\nreinstate Ms.  Laborde (during  the relevant  twelve months)\n\nthat   it  provides   her  with   a  \"legitimate   claim  of\n\nentitlement\" to  that continued employment. That  is to say,\n\nlocal law's narrowing of the employer's discretion to decide\n\nnot  to reinstate  means that  Ms. Laborde  could reasonably\n\nhave believed, and  relied upon her  belief, that local  law\n\nwould likely permit her  to remain employed.  Based  on this\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nreasonable expectation created by local law, Ms. Laborde had\n\na  federally  protected  \"property\"  interest  in  continued\n\nemployment. See Roth, 408  U.S. at 577 (to \"have  a property\n                    \n\ninterest  in a  benefit,\" a person  must \"have  a legitimate\n\nclaim of entitlement to it\"); id. at 578 (implying existence\n                                \n\nof  \"property\"  in  renewal  of  employment   if  employer's\n\ndiscretion to choose not to renew had been narrowed); Bishop\n                                                            \n\nv.  Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 344-45 (1976); cf. Kentucky Dept. of\n                                                            \n\nCorrections  v.   Thompson,  490  U.S.  454,  463-65  (1989)\n                          \n\n(liberty interest created if  prison inmate could reasonably\n\nexpect  that visit  would  be allowed  absent occurrence  of\n\nlisted conditions).   Thus, whether one  views the Company's\n\nactions  as  taking  away  Ms.  Laborde's  present  job,  as\n\nrefusing to reinstate her,  or (realistically) as doing both\n\nat  the same time, the  Company deprived Ms.  Laborde of the\n\nsort of \"property\" that the Constitution protects.\n\n          Second, the  defendants argue  that they  need not\n\nhave given Ms. Laborde any further hearing because a hearing\n\ncould not have  helped her.  Cf. Carey v.  Piphus, 435  U.S.\n                                                 \n\n247, 266-67  (1978) (recovery limited to  nominal damages in\n\ncases  where employer  refuses  hearing but  dismissal still\n\nclearly  justified).   They point  to a  recent Commonwealth\n\nSupreme Court case, Santiago v.  Kodak, 92 J.T.S. 11 (1992),\n                                      \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nwhich  held that  the  Workmen's Compensation  Act does  not\n\nprotect  a person who concededly did not report the relevant\n\naccident until after the employer dismissed him.  They claim\n                    \n\nthat, like the  plaintiff in Santiago,  Ms. Laborde did  not\n                                     \n\nreport her accident until after her dismissal.\n\n          Santiago, however, does not obviate the need for a\n                  \n\nhearing in this case.  Unlike the plaintiff in Santiago, Ms.\n                                                       \n\nLaborde  does  not  concede  that  she  did not  report  the\n\naccident  until  after  she  was dismissed.    Instead,  Ms.\n\nLaborde says that she reported her  second accident when she\n\nsought  treatment at the  Fund on September  7, 1988, before\n                                                            \n\nher  employer  dismissed  her.    She  adds  that  the  Fund\n\ninitially  mixed up  its paperwork,  but later  amended that\n\npaperwork to reflect the  occurrence of her second accident.\n\nThese facts,  if proven, might  well bring her  case outside\n\nthe scope  of Santiago's holding.   Santiago, by emphasizing\n                                            \n\nthe  need  to  determine  the facts,  does  not  avoid, but,\n\nrather, reinforces the need for a hearing.\n\n          Third,  the individual  defendants  say  they  are\n\nentitled to  \"qualified immunity,\"  because, at the  time of\n\nthe relevant  events, their federal  legal obligations  were\n\nunclear.  See  Anderson v. Creighton,  483 U.S. 635,  638-41\n                                    \n\n(1987)   (state  actors   have  qualified   immunity  unless\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nprecedent would have  alerted reasonable person  that action\n\nwould   infringe    \"clearly   established\"   constitutional\n\nprinciple); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1981).  They\n                                \n\ncorrectly point out  that the Supreme  Court of Puerto  Rico\n\ndid not decide until  1992 (after the events here  in issue)\n\nthat  Commonwealth   employees  have  a  right   to  a  pre-\n\ntermination   hearing  where   accident-related,  time-limit\n\nissues  are  in  dispute.   Carron-Lamoutte,  92  J.T.S  97.\n                                           \n\nCarron-Lamoutte,   however,   simply  applied   pre-existing\n               \n\nfederal  constitutional requirements.   In  1985, Loudermill\n                                                            \n\nmade clear that permanent government employees possessed the\n\nfederal  right to  a  pre-discharge hearing.    In 1987,  in\n\nKauffman,  this circuit applied  Loudermill to Puerto Rico's\n                                           \n\nTelephone Company,  making clear that the  company must give\n\nits career employees  pre-discharge hearings (unless illegal\n\nhiring  meant they had never  become career employees in the\n\nfirst place).   See Kauffman,  841 F.2d at  1173.  Thus,  in\n                            \n\n1988, the basic law governing Ms. Laborde's claims was clear\n\nand in her favor.\n\n          We concede  that defendants, in an  effort to show\n\nthat Ms. Laborde  did not possess constitutionally-protected\n\nproperty, have  succeeded in creating an  argument (based on\n\ntheir interpretation of the workmen's  compensation statute)\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nthat is complicated, counterintuitive, and ultimately wrong.\n\nWe also concede  that one who understood that  argument, but\n\nhad  not yet  worked out  the proper  legal response,  might\n\ndoubt whether or not the Constitution protected Ms. Laborde.\n\nYet,  we do not believe  that the potential  existence of an\n\nunusual, sophisticated, and ultimately wrong legal argument,\n\nis sufficient, legally speaking, to muddy what, for immunity\n\npurposes,  would  otherwise amount  to  clear legal  waters.\n\nWere that not so, given the ingenuity of the bar, \"qualified\n\nimmunity\"  would become  absolute  in that  it would  become\n\navailable in virtually any case argued by a creative lawyer.\n\nWe conclude  that the Company's legal  obligation to provide\n\nMs. Laborde with an appropriate hearing before depriving her\n\nof her  job was  clear in 1988.   And, the  district court's\n\ndenial of  the defendants' claims of  qualified immunity was\n\nlegally correct.\n\n          The Telephone  Company  itself makes  one  further\n\nargument.  It says that  it is a special kind of  government\n\nentity, namely a  \"municipal corporation.\"    It points  out\n\nthat  a \"municipal corporation\"  cannot be ordered  to pay a\n\nSection  1983  damage award  based  on  the actions  of  its\n\nofficials  unless those  actions  are alleged  to have  been\n\ntaken  pursuant  to an  official  policy  or custom  of  the\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ncorporation.  See Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of the City\n                                                            \n\nof New York, 436 U.S. 658, 690-91 (1978).  It  contends that\n           \n\nthe court's order directing it to reinstate Ms. Laborde with\n                                                            \n\nback  pay constitutes a \"damage award.\"  And, it claims that\n         \n\nMs. Laborde's  complaint is  deficient in  that it  fails to\n\nallege  the existence  of  an official  policy, pattern,  or\n\npractice which  would justify  this damage award,  as Monell\n                                                            \n\nrequires. \n\n          Assuming much in defendant's favor for the sake of\n\nargument, we find a  short, conclusive answer to  this claim\n\nin the fact that the complaint does properly allege that the\n\nCompany itself  (whether or not a  municipal corporation) is\n\nresponsible  for  the violation  of  the  Constitution.   It\n\nclaims  that all  of  the individual  defendants \"were  duly\n\nappointed officials and/or employees of [the Company];\" that\n\neach  of the  individual  defendants was  \"charged with  the\n\nadministration\" of the Company's employment regulations; and\n\nthat each  of the individual defendants acted, at all times,\n\n\"within  the  scope of  their  employment  as agents  and/or\n\nemployees of [the Company].\"  These allegations amount to an\n\nassertion  that the  actions  of the  individual  defendants\n\nrepresented   Company  policy,  for  which  the  Company  is\n\nresponsible.   We  do  not read  the complaint's  conclusory\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nstatement that plaintiff's \"dismissal\"  violated \"applicable\n\nlaws . . . and . . . regulations\" as alleging the contrary. \n\nMoreover,  the   record  before  us   contains  considerable\n\nevidence  that the  employees'  actions  represent  official\n\nCompany policy; and it contains no evidence to the contrary.\n\nSee  Monell, 436 U.S. at 690 (\"Local  governing bodies . . .\n           \n\ncan be sued directly under   1983 for monetary, declaratory,\n\nor  injunctive relief where . . . the action that is alleged\n\nto be  unconstitutional implements or executes [an official]\n\npolicy statement . . . or decision . . . .\")\n\n          Finally, we  note that the district  court has not\n\nyet calculated back pay  or other damages.  We  realize that\n\nthe way in  which Puerto Rico  law applies to  the facts  as\n\neventually determined  (whether or not  it permits dismissal\n\non  such facts)  may  affect such  calculations. See,  e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nCarey  v.

We affirm. \n                         \n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          Ms.   Laborde  is   a   career  employee   of  the\n\nCommonwealth-owned Telephone  Company, where she  has worked\n\nsince 1975.   On July 7,  1986, she was  injured in a  work-\n\nrelated auto accident.  She received treatment  at the State\n\nInsurance  Fund.   One  year later,  on  July 6,  1987,  she\n\nreturned to work.  Fourteen months  after that, on September\n\n7,  1988, Ms. Laborde went  back to the  Fund for treatment.\n\nIn early October (the following  month) the Company wrote to\n\nMs. Laborde to tell  her that it was dismissing  her because\n\nof absences related to her \"prolonged illness.\" \n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\n          Ms. Laborde, almost  immediately thereafter,  told\n\nCompany  officials that they had made a mistake.  Her latest\n\ntreatment  at the Fund (in  September) was not  related to a\n\n\"prolonged illness.\"   Rather, she said,  the treatment (and\n\nher  absence from  work)  resulted from  a new  work-related\n\naccident, involving moving boxes. That accident had occurred\n\nin  August   1988,  only  two  months   before  her  current\n\ntreatment.\n\n          This \"mistake\" seemed important, for Puerto Rico's\n\nworkers' compensation law requires  an employer to \"reserve\"\n\nthe job of  an injured employee undergoing treatment  at the\n\nFund,  and to \"reinstate\" the employee in that job, but only\n\nif, inter alia, at the time the worker seeks  reinstatement,\n              \n\nno more than \"twelve months\" have  \"lapse[d] . . . from  the\n                           \n\ndate of the  accident.\" P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 11,    7.  (See\n\nAppendix for  complete text  of statutory provision).   More\n\nthan \"twelve months\" had \"lapse[d]\" from Ms. Laborde's first\n\naccident; but only two  months had \"lapse[d]\" from the  time\n\nof the second. \n\n          The Company, either because it did not believe Ms.\n\nLaborde, or  because it  thought her  factual claim  made no\n\ndifference, neither  changed its  mind  about dismissal  nor\n\ngranted Ms. Laborde a hearing at which she could dispute the\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nbasis for  her dismissal.  Ms.  Laborde subsequently brought\n\nthis lawsuit.  She  claimed that the Company, in  effect, by\n\ndepriving  her of her job without any kind of prior hearing,\n\nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  The\n\ndistrict court held that Ms. Laborde was correct.  We agree.\n\n                             II\n\n                          The Law \n                                 \n\n          Like the district court, we find the law clear and\n\nin Ms. Laborde's favor.  The  Fourteenth Amendment says that\n\nthe  Commonwealth  may not  deprive  a  person of  \"property\n\nwithout due process  of law.\"   The Supreme  Court has  made\n\nclear  that  \"property\" includes  the  job  of a  government\n\nemployee who  (under local  law) cannot be  dismissed except\n\nfor  \"good cause.\"  Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 538-39; see also\n                                                            \n\nKercado-Melendez  v.

They did not, and have not yet, provided her with any\n\nsignificant  opportunity for  a hearing.   Hence,  they have\n\ndeprived her  of \"property\"  without the \"process\"  that the\n\nFederal Constitution requires.

First, they say  that, under Puerto  Rico's law,\n\nMs. Laborde  lost her job  when she did not  appear at work;\n\nthe workmen's compensation statute  provides only a right to\n\n\"reinstatement\" (after an  absence caused  by a  job-related\n\ninjury).    The Federal  Constitution,  they  add, does  not\n\nprotect rights to \"reinstatement\" because such  'rights' are\n\nonly expectations  of employment, which  may or  may not  be\n\nfulfilled.

They point  to a  recent Commonwealth\n\nSupreme Court case, Santiago v.

They claim\n                    \n\nthat, like the  plaintiff in Santiago,  Ms. Laborde did  not\n                                     \n\nreport her accident until after her dismissal.\n\n          Santiago, however, does not obviate the need for a\n                  \n\nhearing in this case.  Unlike the plaintiff in Santiago, Ms.\n                                                       \n\nLaborde  does  not  concede  that  she  did not  report  the\n\naccident  until  after  she  was dismissed.    Instead,  Ms.\n\nLaborde says that she reported her  second accident when she\n\nsought  treatment at the  Fund on September  7, 1988, before\n                                                            \n\nher  employer  dismissed  her.    She  adds  that  the  Fund\n\ninitially  mixed up  its paperwork,  but later  amended that\n\npaperwork to reflect the  occurrence of her second accident.\n\nThese facts,  if proven, might  well bring her  case outside\n\nthe scope  of Santiago's holding.   Santiago, by emphasizing\n                                            \n\nthe  need  to  determine  the facts,  does  not  avoid, but,\n\nrather, reinforces the need for a hearing.\n\n          Third,  the individual  defendants  say  they  are\n\nentitled to  \"qualified immunity,\"  because, at the  time of\n\nthe relevant  events, their federal  legal obligations  were\n\nunclear.

They\n                                \n\ncorrectly point out  that the Supreme  Court of Puerto  Rico\n\ndid not decide until  1992 (after the events here  in issue)\n\nthat  Commonwealth   employees  have  a  right   to  a  pre-\n\ntermination   hearing  where   accident-related,  time-limit\n\nissues  are  in  dispute.   Carron-Lamoutte,  92  J.T.S  97.\n                                           \n\nCarron-Lamoutte,   however,   simply  applied   pre-existing\n               \n\nfederal  constitutional requirements.   In  1985, Loudermill\n                                                            \n\nmade clear that permanent government employees possessed the\n\nfederal  right to  a  pre-discharge hearing.    In 1987,  in\n\nKauffman,  this circuit applied  Loudermill to Puerto Rico's\n                                           \n\nTelephone Company,  making clear that the  company must give\n\nits career employees  pre-discharge hearings (unless illegal\n\nhiring  meant they had never  become career employees in the\n\nfirst place).   See Kauffman,  841 F.2d at  1173.  Thus,  in\n                            \n\n1988, the basic law governing Ms. Laborde's claims was clear\n\nand in her favor.\n\n          We concede  that defendants, in an  effort to show\n\nthat Ms. Laborde  did not possess constitutionally-protected\n\nproperty, have  succeeded in creating an  argument (based on\n\ntheir interpretation of the workmen's  compensation statute)\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nthat is complicated, counterintuitive, and ultimately wrong.\n\nWe also concede  that one who understood that  argument, but\n\nhad  not yet  worked out  the proper  legal response,  might\n\ndoubt whether or not the Constitution protected Ms. Laborde.\n\nYet,  we do not believe  that the potential  existence of an\n\nunusual, sophisticated, and ultimately wrong legal argument,\n\nis sufficient, legally speaking, to muddy what, for immunity\n\npurposes,  would  otherwise amount  to  clear legal  waters.\n\nWere that not so, given the ingenuity of the bar, \"qualified\n\nimmunity\"  would become  absolute  in that  it would  become\n\navailable in virtually any case argued by a creative lawyer.\n\nWe conclude  that the Company's legal  obligation to provide\n\nMs. Laborde with an appropriate hearing before depriving her\n\nof her  job was  clear in 1988.   And, the  district court's\n\ndenial of  the defendants' claims of  qualified immunity was\n\nlegally correct.\n\n          The Telephone  Company  itself makes  one  further\n\nargument.  It says that  it is a special kind of  government\n\nentity, namely a  \"municipal corporation.\"    It points  out\n\nthat  a \"municipal corporation\"  cannot be ordered  to pay a\n\nSection  1983  damage award  based  on  the actions  of  its\n\nofficials  unless those  actions  are alleged  to have  been\n\ntaken  pursuant  to an  official  policy  or custom  of  the\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ncorporation.

It  contends that\n           \n\nthe court's order directing it to reinstate Ms. Laborde with\n                                                            \n\nback  pay constitutes a \"damage award.\"  And, it claims that\n         \n\nMs. Laborde's  complaint is  deficient in  that it  fails to\n\nallege  the existence  of  an official  policy, pattern,  or\n\npractice which  would justify  this damage award,  as Monell\n                                                            \n\nrequires. \n\n          Assuming much in defendant's favor for the sake of\n\nargument, we find a  short, conclusive answer to  this claim\n\nin the fact that the complaint does properly allege that the\n\nCompany itself  (whether or not a  municipal corporation) is\n\nresponsible  for  the violation  of  the  Constitution.   It\n\nclaims  that all  of  the individual  defendants \"were  duly\n\nappointed officials and/or employees of [the Company];\" that\n\neach  of the  individual  defendants was  \"charged with  the\n\nadministration\" of the Company's employment regulations; and\n\nthat each  of the individual defendants acted, at all times,\n\n\"within  the  scope of  their  employment  as agents  and/or\n\nemployees of [the Company].\"  These allegations amount to an\n\nassertion  that the  actions  of the  individual  defendants\n\nrepresented   Company  policy,  for  which  the  Company  is\n\nresponsible.   We  do  not read  the complaint's  conclusory\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nstatement that plaintiff's \"dismissal\"  violated \"applicable\n\nlaws . . . and . . . regulations\" as alleging the contrary. \n\nMoreover,  the   record  before  us   contains  considerable\n\nevidence  that the  employees'  actions  represent  official\n\nCompany policy; and it contains no evidence to the contrary.\n\nSee  Monell, 436 U.S. at 690 (\"Local  governing bodies . . .\n           \n\ncan be sued directly under   1983 for monetary, declaratory,\n\nor  injunctive relief where . . . the action that is alleged\n\nto be  unconstitutional implements or executes [an official]\n\npolicy statement . . . or decision . . . .\")\n\n          Finally, we  note that the district  court has not\n\nyet calculated back pay  or other damages.  We  realize that\n\nthe way in  which Puerto Rico  law applies to  the facts  as\n\neventually determined  (whether or not  it permits dismissal\n\non  such facts)  may  affect such  calculations.
