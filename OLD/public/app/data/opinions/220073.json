Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Arthur G. Telegen, with whom John E. Duke and Seyfarth Shaw,\nLLP were on brief, for appellant.\n     Harold L. Lichten, with whom Timothy Belcher, Lichten & Liss-\nRiordan, P.C., Alfred Gordon, and Pyle Rome Ehrenberg, P.C. were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 30, 2011\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge.     This appeal arises from a denial of\n\ninjunctive relief against a union under Boys Markets, Inc. v.\n\nRetail Clerks Union, Local 770, 398 U.S. 235 (1970), and § 301 of\n\nthe Labor-Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. § 185, as well\n\nas a denial of declaratory relief concerning actions previously\n\ntaken by that union.      We affirm the denial of injunctive relief,\n\nvacate the denial of declaratory relief, and remand.\n\n          Verizon   New    England,   Inc.   (VNE)    alleges   that   the\n\nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 2322 (the\n\nUnion) violated a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) no-strike\n\nclause on four occasions in 2008 and 2009.      VNE argues that these\n\nacts were part of a pattern of behavior undercutting the arbitral\n\nprocess that warrants federal court relief.          It alleges that the\n\nUnion did not comply with the CBA when its members (1) made\n\nrepresentations that the Union would fine members who brought\n\nrequired devices to work, (2) engaged in a short but concerted work\n\nstoppage, (3) coordinated refusals to volunteer for overtime work,\n\nand (4) protested at a VNE facility each morning for several weeks.\n\nVNE seeks injunctive relief and, in the alternative, declaratory\n\nrelief in furtherance of the arbitral process.\n\n          The district court granted the Union's motion for summary\n\njudgment, finding that VNE had not shown future harm and declining\n\nto issue either injunctive or declaratory relief.           Verizon New\n\nEngland, Inc. v. Local No. 2322, Int'l . Bhd. of Elec. Workers, No.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f09-10165-RGS, 2010 WL 3282605 (D. Mass. Aug. 20, 2010).           Because a\n\nBoys Markets injunction must meet the traditional standards for\n\ninjunctive   relief   and   because    VNE   has   not,   at   this    point,\n\ndemonstrated irreparable injury, we find no abuse of discretion in\n\nthe district court's denial of injunctive relief. However, because\n\nwe believe the district court misapprehended the relevant legal\n\nstandard for declaratory relief, we vacate the denial of that\n\nrelief and remand for further consideration of the issue.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            The CBA, effective from August 3, 2008 until August 6,\n\n2011, contains a no-strike clause at Article G10.               The clause\n\nprovides,\n\n            The Union agrees that during the term of this\n            Agreement, or any extension thereof, it will\n            not cause or permit its members to cause, nor\n            will any member of the Union take part in, any\n            strike of or interference with any of the\n            Company's operations or picketing of any of\n            the Company's premises.\n\nNotably, the clause prohibits interference with operations and\n\npicketing of company premises in addition to strikes.                 It also\n\nimposes obligations on the Union with respect to both its own\n\nconduct and the conduct of its members.\n\n            Under Article G8 of the CBA, the Union may submit to a\n\ngrievance process any \"complaint involving the interpretation or\n\napplication of any provisions of this Agreement\" and any \"complaint\n\nthat an employee or group of employees for whom the Union is the\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fbargaining agent has, in any manner, been unfairly treated.\" After\n\nthe conclusion of the final step of the grievance procedure, under\n\nArticle G9 the Union may demand arbitration when it believes \"the\n\nintent and meaning of one or more of the Articles of this Agreement\n\n. . . has been violated by the Company,\" provided that certain\n\nprocedural   prerequisites   have   been     met.     The   CBA   allows   for\n\nexpedited arbitration for \"any grievance involving the suspension\n\nof an individual employee.\"\n\n           The CBA does not permit VNE to invoke the grievance\n\nprocedure to institute the process leading toward arbitration.\n\nOnly the Union may do so, and VNE contends that the Union's failure\n\nto invoke these procedures led to this lawsuit. Rather than follow\n\nthe grievance process, VNE asserts, the Union and its members have\n\ntaken \"self-help\" measures in violation of the no-strike clause.\n\nIn its complaint, VNE focused on what it asserts are four such\n\nprohibited self-help measures. One of these alleged violations was\n\nin response to a new company rule concerning the transport of\n\ncompany   tools,   while   the   remaining    three    alleged    violations\n\nfollowed an altercation between a Union member and his supervisor.\n\n           VNE has sought to place these instances within the\n\ncontext of a previous pattern of conduct it claims violated the no-\n\nstrike clause.     Most of these incidents involved other locals:\n\nLocals 2321, 2324, and 2222.         As to incidents involving other\n\nlocals, VNE asserts that since 2007 there have been two alleged\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fincidents of picketing, a \"sit-down\" strike, a boycott of overtime,\n\nand pressures by local representatives to reduce productivity. VNE\n\nalso alleges that there have been \"[p]eriodic efforts\" by \"several\n\nLocals to discourage bargaining unit employees from accepting\n\ntemporary assignments to management positions going back to the\n\nmid-1980s.\"       As to incidents involving Local 2322, the defendant\n\nhere,   VNE     notes   that   members    protested      the    discipline       of   an\n\nemployee in 2001 by engaging in a \"sick out,\" which was enjoined by\n\nVerizon    New     England,      Inc.   v.     International      Brotherhood          of\n\nElectrical Workers, No. 01-11636, slip op. at 1-2 (D. Mass. Nov.\n\n17, 2001).\n\n               The first of the four alleged violations at the core of\n\nthis    suit    followed   the    introduction      of   a     company    rule    that\n\nemployees transport company-issued tool kits between job sites. An\n\nearlier rule had required only that tools be on the job site with\n\nthe employee.      For Equipment Installation Technicians (EI Techs),\n\nemployees who are routinely assigned to work on lengthy projects at\n\nremote locations in the field, company-issued tool kits included\n\ncell phones equipped with global positioning capabilities. Some EI\n\nTechs, apparently concerned that VNE might use the phones to track\n\ntheir   movements,      refused    to    comply   with    the    new     rule.        VNE\n\ndisciplined two employees for non-compliance with the rule shortly\n\nafter it was issued, and the Union grieved these disciplinary\n\nactions.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f          In    addition    to   filing   these   grievances,   the   Union\n\nestablished a set of \"EI Work Rules.\"          The chief steward for EI\n\nTechs, Katherine Crowley, drafted these rules after confirming with\n\nthe   Union's    business   manager   and    highest   official,      Eugene\n\nMcLaughlin, that the EI Techs could create such rules and after\n\nconfirming with the Union's assistant business manager, Chris\n\nJolls, that such rules could be enforced by fines.        One rule stated\n\nthat it was the Union's position that employees must be paid to\n\ntravel or transport any company tools they choose to carry on\n\npersonal time.    The rule instructed EI Techs to claim overtime and\n\ntravel expenses, and stated that if overtime and travel expenses\n\nwere denied, \"this must be grieved.\"        It continued, \"[t]his is not\n\nnegotiable and is contractual.\"\n\n          The EI Techs adopted the rules at a Union meeting.\n\nShortly thereafter, on January 8, 2009, Crowley sent an email to\n\nUnion members.     The email stated, \"The decision has been made to\n\nenforce the union E.I. Work Rule number one in regard to the tools.\n\nThe union stance is as follows, do not transport any tools (except\n\nfor the 3 items under protest) for the manager[s]. . . .         You could\n\nbe subject to answer . . . for your actions and a possible\n\nfine. . . .\"    After Crowley sent this email, McLaughlin called her\n\nand told her not to send any more email messages.        Crowley was not\n\ntold why she should not send any additional emails, however, nor\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fwas she told to retract the email.        She received no instruction as\n\nto how to enforce the EI Work Rules, and remained a chief steward.\n\n            VNE alleges that only one EI Tech did not comply with the\n\nEI Work Rules, and that he was spoken to by many of the other\n\nemployees.      The Union, by contrast, alleges that no EI Tech ever\n\nfailed to actually carry the company's tools.          On this motion for\n\nsummary judgment, we must take any conflict in the evidence in the\n\nlight    most   favorable   to   VNE,   the   non-moving   party.   It   is\n\nundisputed that no employees were disciplined by the Union for\n\nfailing to comply with the EI Work Rules.\n\n            The three other alleged violations at the core of this\n\nsuit followed an August 25, 2009 confrontation between a splice-\n\nservice technician (SST), Peter Sem, and his supervisor, Patty\n\nRegan, in a parking lot next to the VNE garage in Brockton where\n\nthey worked.      The facts concerning the altercation are disputed,\n\nthough again we must take the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nVNE, the non-moving party.       VNE alleges that Sem was drinking and\n\nthat when Regan approached with a camera he assaulted her and broke\n\nthe camera.1     VNE suspended and later fired Sem as a result of the\n\naltercation.      Regan also filed a criminal complaint against him;\n\nSem was placed on probation and ordered to pay Regan $313 in\n\nrestitution.\n\n\n\n     1\n          The Union contends that Regan accosted Sem and that, as\nSem attempted to defend himself, Regan dropped her camera.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f           The second alleged violation of Article G10 occurred a\n\nfew days after the altercation, on August 28, 2009.              That morning,\n\nall the employees in the garage refused to work until they had\n\nspoken to a third-level supervisor, Lance Cummings.              The garage's\n\nchief steward, Bob Wall, told a first-level supervisor, Michael\n\nShea, that the employees felt unsafe around Regan.              Shea responded\n\nthat Cummings would not come to the garage and that the employees\n\nneeded to return to work.         The employees did not return to work,\n\nand after about forty-five minutes Shea told them that if they did\n\nnot return to work within five minutes they would be suspended.             In\n\nthe   ensuing   five   minutes,    during   which    only   a   few   employees\n\nreturned to work, Shea contacted the Union's new business manager,\n\nErik Hetrick.    Shea informed Hetrick that VNE was about to suspend\n\nalmost all of the employees at the garage.\n\n           Hetrick requested that Shea delay any suspensions until\n\nhe could get to the garage, and drove from the Union headquarters\n\nin Middleboro to the garage in Brockton.            Once Hetrick arrived he\n\nspoke with the employees and reassured Shea that he believed the\n\nsituation would resolve itself.             He then called Cummings and\n\nrequested that Regan not interact with the employees until after a\n\nrepresentative from VNE's Employee Assistance Plan had spoken with\n\nthem the following Monday.        After Cummings accepted that request,\n\nthe employees returned to work.             VNE estimates that this work\n\nstoppage delayed the start of the work day by between an hour and\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fan hour and a half, and argues that the stoppage violated the no-\n\nstrike clause in Article G10.    The Union submits that the delay was\n\nshorter, but we take the estimate of VNE, the non-moving party.\n\n            VNE alleges that a third violation of Article G10 also\n\nbegan on August 28, 2009, when employees at the Brockton garage who\n\nhad previously made themselves available to work voluntary overtime\n\nrefused to work that overtime.    VNE's Director of Labor Relations,\n\nJoseph Santos, informed Hetrick in a letter dated the same day that\n\nthe employees declining overtime were acting \"in protest of a\n\ndispute subject to arbitration under the collective bargaining\n\nagreement.\"   The letter stated that the Union's obligations under\n\nArticle G10 of the agreement required that it not permit such\n\ninterference with VNE's operations.     Santos requested that Hetrick\n\ninform him of the actions the Union was taking to restore voluntary\n\novertime. Hetrick responded by fax stating that it was the Union's\n\nposition that it had satisfied its obligations under Article G10.\n\nBy September 3, 2009, every SST in the Union was refusing voluntary\n\novertime.\n\n            Finally, VNE alleges that employees at the Brockton\n\ngarage violated the no-strike clause of the CBA by picketing the\n\nentrance to the garage.     It is undisputed that on September 1,\n\n2009, about twenty EI Techs began protesting in front of the\n\nBrockton garage each morning between 7:15 and 7:30.    The employees\n\nwalked between the two entrances of the garage and some carried\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fsigns.    The Union denies that it organized these actions, but it\n\nacknowledges that Hetrick and other Union leaders participated.\n\nThe Union has conceded that these protests lasted a few weeks.\n\n              In its supplemental complaint, VNE argued that these\n\nactions interfered with VNE's business and that the Union failed to\n\nmeet its obligations to prevent and eliminate these interferences.\n\nIt argued that the alleged CBA violations caused irreparable injury\n\nto VNE by undermining the grievance and arbitration provisions of\n\nthe CBA and by injuring VNE's goodwill among customers in the\n\ntelecommunications          field.        VNE   acknowledged   that    the   damages\n\nresulting      from      these       alleged      harms     were    not      \"readily\n\nascertainable,\" and has not pursued the request for damages it\n\nnonetheless included in its complaint.                It has focused on the two\n\nother    forms      of   relief      it   requested:      injunctive   relief    and\n\ndeclaratory relief.          The proposed injunctive relief would enjoin\n\nthe   Union    to    take    adequate       steps   to    prevent   future    strike\n\nactivities.\n\n              The Union sought summary judgment arguing that VNE had\n\nfailed to identify a violation of the no-strike clause and that in\n\nany case VNE had failed to show that any violations had caused\n\ndamages or irreparable harm.              It argued that (1) VNE had not found\n\nthat any employee refused to carry company tools as directed by\n\nVNE, and at any rate the Union was not responsible for the actions\n\nof a rogue Union steward directing members not to follow the\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fpolicy; (2) the Union acted swiftly to resolve the initial protest\n\nat the Brockton garage and prevented it from causing any harm to\n\nVNE; (3) VNE employees were entitled to refuse voluntary overtime\n\nbecause VNE may compel mandatory overtime, and the fact that VNE\n\ndid not compel mandatory overtime demonstrates that it was not\n\nharmed by this refusal; and (4) the protests held outside of the\n\nBrockton garage did not constitute picketing, and at any rate did\n\nnot cause VNE any harm.         Further, the Union argued, VNE had\n\navailable contract remedies; that is, VNE could have suspended\n\nemployees, provoking the Union to start the arbitral process.\n\n           Without detailing all of VNE's responses, it is quite\n\nclear that the Union was not entitled to summary judgment based on\n\nits defense that there neither was nor could have been a breach of\n\nthe CBA's no-strike clause.     At the very least, there were facts in\n\ndispute and the Union's attempt to disclaim any responsibility is\n\nunfounded.     VNE provided evidence that the purportedly rogue Union\n\nsteward acted with the Union's approval and complicity, that the\n\nsit-down strike and picketing were a classic example of wink/wink,\n\nnod/nod   by   Union   officials,   and    that   at   least   the   voluntary\n\novertime boycott affected its operations.\n\n           The district court did not assess the evidence as to\n\nwhether CBA violations had occurred.              Instead, it assessed the\n\nlevel of harm to VNE and the ongoing nature of the alleged\n\nviolations.     The district court granted summary judgment for the\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fUnion on VNE's request for injunctive relief, finding that VNE had\n\nnot alleged any ongoing breach of the CBA and had not adequately\n\nalleged either irreparable harm or a threat of a future CBA breach.\n\nVerizon New England, 2010 WL 3282605, at *5-7.\n\n            The district court also granted summary judgment for the\n\nUnion on VNE's request for declaratory relief, finding that two of\n\nthe four alleged CBA violations presented no threat of recurrence,\n\nand that declarations concerning the remaining two violations would\n\nbe too abstract and uncertain to warrant this form of relief.                  Id.\n\nat *7.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            The      Norris-La   Guardia    Act   of   1932    (NLA)    prohibited\n\nfederal courts from granting injunctive relief in labor disputes.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 104.         In 1947, however, Congress enacted the LMRA,\n\nwhich    gave    federal    courts   jurisdiction       over    suits    alleging\n\nviolations      of    collective   bargaining      agreements.         29   U.S.C.\n\n§ 185(a).       In the 1950s, the use of arbitration to resolve labor\n\ndisputes became a central and controlling component of federal\n\nlabor policy. See Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S.\n\n448, 455 (1957).        In the Steelworkers trilogy in 1960, moreover,\n\nthe Supreme Court strengthened the requirement for arbitration\n\nunder collective bargaining agreements. See United Steelworkers v.\n\nAm. Mfg. Co., 363 U.S. 564 (1960); United Steelworkers v. Warrior\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f& Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574 (1960); United Steelworkers v.\n\nEnter. Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593 (1960).\n\n          There was some tension between the NLA, the LMRA, and\n\nthis emphasis on arbitration.         The Supreme Court found there was a\n\nneed for some adjustment of the prohibition against enjoining\n\nstrikes contained in the NLA in light of the LMRA and the use of\n\narbitration.     In Boys Markets2 the Court held that, despite the\n\nanti-injunction provisions of § 4 of the NLA, a federal court in\n\nLMRA § 301(a) cases may issue limited injunctive relief to protect\n\nthe effectiveness of arbitration agreements:\n\n          [T]he very purpose of arbitration procedures\n          is to provide a mechanism for the expeditious\n          settlement of industrial disputes without\n          resort to strikes, lockouts, or other self-\n          help measures.      This basic purpose is\n          obviously largely undercut if there is no\n          immediate, effective remedy for those very\n          tactics that arbitration is designed to\n          obviate.\n\nBoys Markets, 398 U.S. at 249.          The Court expressed concern that\n\nincentives     for   employers   to    agree   to   submit   grievances   to\n\narbitration would be inappropriately dissipated3 if employers were\n\n\n     2\n          Boys Markets overruled Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson,\n370 U.S. 195 (1962), an earlier effort among a series of efforts to\nreconcile these tensions. See Boys Mkts., Inc. v. Retail Clerks\nUnion, Local 770, 398 U.S. 235, 237-38 (1970); see generally, Paula\nL. McDonald, Comment, Judicial Interpretation of Collective\nBargaining Agreements: The Danger Inherent in the Determination of\nArbitrability, 1983 Duke L.J. 848, 853-57.\n     3\n          VNE is not precluded from Boys Markets relief by the fact\nthat only the Union could institute the grievances and arbitration\nprocesses under the CBA. Once arbitration is sought, both parties\n\n                                      -13-\n\fdeprived of injunctive relief to enforce the quid pro quo of a no-\n\nstrike clause.4   Id. at 248.\n\n          In Boys Markets, the Supreme Court established certain\n\npreconditions for the issuance of injunctive relief in labor\n\ndisputes: (a) the existence of a no-strike clause, (b) clarity that\n\nthe grievance in question was subject to arbitration, and (c)\n\nemployer readiness to engage in such arbitration.   Id. at 253-54.\n\nIn addition to these preconditions, there are other limitations on\n\nthe grant of a Boys Markets injunction.   The injunction must also\n\nmeet all the usual criteria for injunctive relief, including\n\nirreparable injury, likelihood of success on the merits, balancing\n\nof the equities, and consideration of the public interest.   Id. at\n\n\n\nare bound to arbitrate. If the Union grieves, then VNE must follow\nthe procedures through arbitration. That is all that Boys Markets,\nwith its statement that \"both parties are contractually bound\" to\narbitrate, 398 U.S. at 254, requires. See also Avco Corp. v. Local\nUnion #787, 459 F.2d 968, 972 (3d Cir. 1972).       Indeed, one-way\ngrievance ratchets may increase the likelihood of employers seeking\nBoys Markets injunctions. In any event, the Union has not asserted\nthat the normal rules for Boys Markets cases are somehow altered by\nthe fact that the CBA in this case contains such a one-way ratchet.\n     4\n          Some courts have recognized what is called \"the reverse\nBoys Markets exception.\" Aeronautical Indus. Dist. Lodge 91 v.\nUnited Techs. Corp., 230 F.3d 569 (2d Cir. 2000). This exception\n\"permits unions to obtain injunctions against employers to preserve\nthe status quo pending arbitration of a labor dispute as long as:\n(1) the underlying dispute is subject to mandatory arbitration; and\n(2) an injunction is necessary to prevent the arbitration process\nfrom becoming a 'hollow formality' or 'meaningless ritual.'\" Id.\nat 581 (quoting Niagara Hooker Emps. Union v. Occidental Chem.\nCorp., 935 F. 2d 1370, 1377, (2d Cir. 1991)); see also Lever Bros.\nCo. v. Int'l Chem. Workers Union, 554 F.2d 115, 123 (4th Cir.\n1976).\n\n                                -14-\n\f254.    Further, the Court held that an employer \"should be ordered\n\nto arbitrate, as a condition of . . . obtaining an injunction\n\nagainst    the    strike.\"      Id.   (quoting   Sinclair    Refining     Co.   v.\n\nAtkinson, 370 U.S. 195, 228 (1962) (Brennan, J., dissenting)).\n\n            Many years ago this Court held there are three conditions\n\nfor injunctive relief under Boys Market: \"(1) the collective\n\nbargaining agreement must contain mandatory arbitration procedures;\n\n(2) the strike to be enjoined must be over an arbitrable grievance;\n\nand (3) 'ordinary principles of equity' must warrant the injunctive\n\nrelief.\"    Nat'l Elevator Indus., Inc. v. Int'l Union of Elevator\n\nConstructors, 776 F.2d 374, 376-77 (1st Cir. 1985) (quoting Int'l\n\nDetective Serv., Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 251, 614\n\nF.2d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 1980)).             The first two of these conditions\n\nare clearly met in this case.               As to the first, there is no\n\nquestion    that     the     collective     bargaining     agreement     contains\n\nmandatory       arbitration    procedures.       As   to    the   second,       the\n\npresumption of arbitrability applies in Boys Markets cases, see\n\nGateway Coal Co. v. United Mineworkers, 414 U.S. 368, 379-82\n\n(1974), and the disputes at issue here certainly appear to be over\n\narbitral grievances.         The third condition presents a steeper climb\n\nfor VNE.\n\n            Our analysis is informed by both statutory constraints\n\nand    limits    stemming    from   the   rationale   for   the   Boys   Markets\n\ninjunction. As to statutory restrictions, Boys Markets injunctions\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fare limited by § 9 of the NLA, which requires that injunctions\n\ncontain \"only a prohibition of such specific act or acts as may be\n\nexpressly complained of in the . . . complaint or petition filed\"\n\nin the case.        29 U.S.C. § 109; Latas Libby's, Inc. v. United\n\nSteelworkers, 609 F.2d 25, 31 (1st Cir. 1979).5                   As to limits\n\nstemming from the rationale in Boys Markets, the Supreme Court has\n\nheld that a Boys Markets injunction can only issue if the dispute\n\nis    \"over\"    issues   which   the     striking   union   is    obligated   to\n\narbitrate. Buffalo Forge Co. v. United Steelworkers, 428 U.S. 397,\n\n407 (1976).        In so holding, the Court responded to risks that\n\nemployers       would    seek    court    determinations     on     issues    of\n\narbitrability meant to be left to arbitrators.\n\n               Under Buffalo Forge, the underlying grievance, not just\n\nthe activity to be enjoined, must be governed by the arbitration\n\nrequirement.        If there were no requirement to arbitrate that\n\ngrievance, any injunction could hardly be in aid of arbitration.\n\nId.    When it is clear the strike is not \"over\" such issues, no\n\ninjunction may issue.       In Buffalo Forge, the Court held that it was\n\n\n\n       5\n          While this circuit apparently has not reached the\nquestion, see Otis Elevator Co. v. Int'l Union of Elevator\nConstructors, Local 4, 408 F.3d 1, 7 n.5 (1st Cir. 2005), most\ncourts have concluded that the requirements of § 7 of the NLA also\napply to Boys Markets injunctions. That section, 29 U.S.C. § 107,\nspecifies certain procedural and evidentiary requirements. See 1\nJohn E. Higgins, Jr., The Developing Labor Law 1449 n.255 (5th ed.\n2006) (collecting cases). The Supreme Court has not addressed the\nquestion of the applicability of these NLA requirements in Boys\nMarkets cases. Id.\n\n                                       -16-\n\ferror to issue a Boys Markets injunction against a sympathy strike\n\nwhich \"had neither the purpose nor the effect of denying or evading\n\nan obligation to arbitrate or of depriving the employer of its\n\nbargain.\"     Id. at 407-408.      The Supreme Court reinforced this\n\nrequirement    in   Jacksonville     Bulk    Terminals   v.   International\n\nLongshoremen's Ass'n, 457 U.S. 702 (1982), holding that a Boys\n\nMarkets injunction should not issue to stop a politically motivated\n\nboycott that was plainly not arbitrable.          Id. at 721.\n\n            This court has read Boys Markets such that frustration of\n\nthe arbitral process does not necessarily establish irreparable\n\ninjury for purposes of injunctive relief.           In Latas Libby's, we\n\naffirmed a district court's finding that a union had violated a no-\n\nstrike clause and affirmed the district court's award of damages\n\nfor the illegal strike.      Latas Libby's, 609 F.2d at 28-30.             We\n\nvacated,    however,   prospective    injunctive   relief     as   to   future\n\nstrikes.    The injunction had required the union to comply in all\n\nfuture actions with the no-strike clause of the CBA.               Id. at 30.\n\nThis court held that given that the record disclosed no prior\n\nviolations of the no-strike agreement, the prospective injunctive\n\nrelief went further than needed.            Id. at 30-32.     We commented,\n\n\"[a]lthough we do not say that repeated violations of a no-strike\n\ncovenant never warrant broad prospective relief, in the absence of\n\nany showing here of a continuing course of conduct evidencing the\n\nunwillingness of the Union to abide by the no-strike provision,\"\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fthe district court's injunction was too broad to stand.             Id.    We\n\nalso noted that the broad relief granted would violate § 9 of the\n\nNLA.    Id. at 31.\n\n            This court has also reaffirmed the requirement that\n\ninjunctive   relief   may   only   be   granted   under   Boys   Markets   in\n\nfurtherance of the arbitral process.        In Tejidos de Coamo, Inc. v.\n\nInternational Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, 22 F.3d 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1994), we held that an order on behalf of an employer staying\n\narbitration, id. at 11, was an immediately appealable injunction\n\nand that the injunction was not validly issued under Boys Markets,\n\nsee id. at 12-13.     There, injunctive relief could not be justified\n\n\"on either ground--to enforce a contract or support arbitration--\n\nlet alone both.\"      Id. at 12.    That an order staying arbitration\n\ncould not be in support of arbitration was self-evident.           Id.     The\n\ncompany argued that there was no contract requiring arbitration and\n\nthat it could not be forced into arbitration.         Id.\n\n            In addition to vacating overly broad injunctive relief\n\nand injunctive relief that did not advance the arbitral process,\n\nthis court has also reversed grants of Boys Markets injunctive\n\nrelief for failure to meet the traditional four-part equitable\n\ntest.    See Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Teamsters Local No. 633, 511\n\nF.2d 1097, 1100 (1st Cir. 1975) (holding that the balance of\n\nrelative harms to the parties showed employer did not meet its\n\nburden).\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f          Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has imposed any\n\nrequirements as to the sequence of decision making on issues\n\npresented by Boys Markets injunction requests.       Cf. Pearson v.\n\nCallahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 818-21 (2009) (holding that there is no\n\nmandatory order of decisionmaking in qualified immunity cases).\n\nThere is no reason why the district court could not jump, as it\n\ndid, to the irreparable injury issue, and so we turn to that.     We\n\nreview denials of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion,\n\nreviewing underlying legal questions de novo. Animal Welfare Inst.\n\nv. Martin, 623 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n          VNE argues that the district court made several errors in\n\nits denial of injunctive relief.      Primarily, it argues the court\n\nmisapprehended the nature of the harm at issue by measuring the\n\ndirect harm caused by each alleged CBA violation.6   VNE argues that\n\nthe court should have taken the four alleged violations as a whole\n\nand assessed \"the harm to the arbitral process caused by the\n\nUnion's repeated resort to picketing and strikes over matters the\n\nUnion seems to agree are subject to the grievance and arbitration\n\nprovisions of the CBA.\"\n\n          In the more common case in which Boys Markets injunctions\n\nhave been issued, the strike is occurring at the time of suit or is\n\n\n\n     6\n          We note but do not reach VNE's argument that the district\ncourt erred in its balance of the hardships analysis because, in\nits view, the Union could not be harmed by taking matters to\ngrievance and arbitration.\n\n                               -19-\n\fimminent.       See 1 John E. Higgins, Jr., The Developing Labor Law\n\n1461 (5th ed. 2006).          Boys Markets itself concerned an ongoing\n\nviolation of a no-strike clause. Boys Markets, 398 U.S. at 239-40.\n\nIn theory, questions may arise as to the application of Boys\n\nMarkets to job actions short of actual strikes.              But we have held\n\nthat activities short of an actual strike may also violate no-\n\nstrike clauses, including work slowdowns and concerted refusals to\n\nwork overtime.7     Nat'l Elevator Indus., 776 F.2d 374; see also Avco\n\nCorp. v. Local Union #787, UAW, 459 F.2d 968, 974 (3d Cir. 1972)\n\n(holding that concerted refusals to work overtime fell within the\n\nproscriptions      of   a   CBA   no-strike   clause   and   were   subject   to\n\ninjunctive relief under Boys Markets).\n\n              The fact that there is no present ongoing dispute as to\n\nthese four alleged violations does not, of course, mean the case is\n\nmoot.       See Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, 457 U.S. at 704 n.1 (suit\n\nby employer under LMRA § 301 is not mooted by cessation of work\n\nstoppage).      But that fact does go to the issue of irreparable harm.\n\nPatterns of repeated past strikes in violation of no-strike clauses\n\nmay support issuance of prospective injunctive relief even when\n\nthere is no ongoing strike.            As the district court recognized,\n\nhowever, in this case the four alleged job actions were not full-\n\n\n        7\n          VNE's complaint details other clauses in the CBA that it\nalleges are violated by the Union's actions, but we need not delve\ninto whether other types of clauses subject to mandatory\narbitration may support a Boys Markets injunction as those other\nclauses are not invoked on appeal.\n\n                                       -20-\n\fblown strikes, nor do the alleged actions establish a repeated\n\npattern giving rise to ongoing harm.          VNE's assertion that the four\n\nalleged      breaches   threaten   \"death    by   pin   pricks,\"   Verizon   New\n\nEngland, 2010 WL 3282605, at *7 n.7, is insufficient.              The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in holding that the threshold of\n\nirreparable injury had not been met.\n\n                                     III.\n\n              The Supreme Court has indicated that appellate review of\n\ndiscretionary decisions not to grant declaratory relief is generally\n\nfor abuse of discretion.       See Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S.\n\n277,       289-90   (1995).   It    has     \"repeatedly    characterized     the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act as 'an enabling Act, which confers a\n\ndiscretion on the courts rather than an absolute right upon the\n\nlitigant.'\" Id. at 287 (quoting Pub. Serv. Comm'n of Utah v. Wycoff\n\nCo., 344 U.S. 237, 241 (1952)).           The Court has not yet established\n\nthe contours of that abuse of discretion review except in cases\n\nwhere the denial is based on there being a parallel proceeding which\n\npresents the opportunity to ventilate the same state law issues in\n\nthe state courts.       See id. at 290.      Wilton expressly declined \"to\n\ndelineate the outer boundaries of that discretion\" in cases raising\n\nissues of federal law, id., such as the case before us.8\n\n\n       8\n          In a pre-Wilton case this court held that where the\ndistrict court holds it lacks jurisdiction to issue a declaratory\njudgment because a case is not ripe, that issue is usually reviewed\nde novo. Ernst & Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d\n530, 534 (1st Cir. 1995). As to the discretionary aspects of a\n\n                                     -21-\n\f          Out of caution, we apply an abuse of discretion standard\n\nof review to all aspects of the denial of a declaratory judgment\n\nhere, with the important caveat that errors of law constitute an\n\nabuse of discretion.       Voice of the Arab World, Inc. v. MDTV Med.\n\nNews Now, Inc., No. 10-1396, 2011 WL 2090132, at *3 (1st Cir. May\n\n27, 2011). At any rate, we reach the same result under any standard\n\nof review.    See Rossi v. Gemma, 489 F.3d 26, 38 n.21 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n          We start with the basics.            Requests for a declaratory\n\njudgment may not be granted unless they arise in a context of a\n\ncontroversy   \"ripe\"     for   judicial    resolution.      Abbott    Labs.   v.\n\nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967), abrogated on other grounds by\n\nCalifano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977).                Ripeness is an\n\nArticle III jurisdictional requirement.           The need for ripeness is\n\nemphasized    in   the   Declaratory      Judgment   Act   (DJA),    28   U.S.C.\n\n\n\n\ndecision to withhold declaratory judgment, we said in Ernst & Young\nthat we hewed a middle ground, between de novo and abuse of\ndiscretion review. Id. \"This standard encourages the exercise of\nindependent appellate judgment if it appears that a mistake has\nbeen made.\" Id. It is unclear whether Wilton overruled Ernst &\nYoung on this point, at least in federal question cases.\n     Our case law post-Wilton has articulated both standards of\nreview.   In a case involving a student's claim for declaratory\nrelief under IDEA, we adhered to the Ernst & Young formulation.\nSee Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico, 451 F.3d 13, 39 (1st Cir. 2006).\nHowever, in two other cases, we stated the standard of review for\ndenial of declaratory relief as a simple abuse of discretion\nstandard, without discussing Wilton's caveats. See Hartford Fire\nIns. Co. v. R.I. Pub. Transit Auth., 233 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir.\n2000); DeNovelis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 313 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                    -22-\n\f§ 2201(a), which refers to an \"actual\" controversy.               This is a sine\n\nqua non of any assumption of federal jurisdiction.\n\n           In Ernst & Young v. Depositors Economic Protection Corp.,\n\n45 F.3d 530 (1st Cir. 1995), we interpreted Abbott Labs. to hold\n\nthat   where   challenges   are   asserted    to   government      actions   and\n\nripeness questions arise, a court must consider both \"fitness\" for\n\nreview and \"hardship.\"      Id. at 535.    The \"fitness\" inquiry concerns\n\nquestions of finality, definiteness, and the need for further\n\nfactual development.        Id.   Under \"hardship,\" the court should\n\nconsider whether the challenged action \"creates a 'direct and\n\nimmediate' dilemma\" for the parties.         Id. (quoting W.R. Grace & Co.\n\nv. EPA, 959 F.2d 360, 364 (1st Cir. 1992)).              As we have reaffirmed\n\nsince our decision in Ernst & Young, these inquiries are highly\n\nfact-dependent, such that the \"various integers that enter into the\n\nripeness equation play out quite differently from case to case.\"\n\nDoe v. Bush, 323 F.3d 133, 138 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Ernst &\n\nYoung, 45 F.3d at 535).\n\n           Before   the     district   court,      the    Union    argued    that\n\ndeclaratory relief should not be granted because VNE's allegations\n\nwere not of \"sufficient immediacy or controversy\" to warrant the\n\nexercise of the court's discretion.        It argued that the controversy\n\nwas no longer ongoing, and that VNE had not shown that the arbitral\n\nprocess had failed to function properly.                 In State of R.I. v.\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685 (1st Cir. 1999), we rejected\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fsuch a confined approach to considering the question of \"hardship.\"\n\nIn that case, we firmly held that \"this part of the [ripeness]\n\ninquiry should focus on the judgment's usefulness.\"               Id. at 693.\n\nWe held that \"[r]ather than asking, negatively, whether denying\n\nrelief would impose hardship, courts will do well to ask, in a more\n\npositive vein, whether granting relief would serve a useful purpose,\n\nor, put another way, whether the sought-after declaration would be\n\nof practical assistance in setting the underlying controversy to\n\nrest.\"    Id.\n\n            The district court identified this governing standard, but\n\nits analysis did not comport with the standard's requirements.              The\n\ncourt    concluded   that   the   first   two   of   the   four   claimed   CBA\n\nviolations could not meet the ripeness requirement because \"they\n\npertain to discrete past incidents that present no threat of\n\nrecurrence.\"     Verizon New England, 2010 WL 3282605, at *7.               It\n\nallowed that there could be possible future harm to VNE from renewed\n\nboycotts of voluntary overtime or wildcat picketing, but held it\n\nwould be inappropriate to comment on future events.           Id.   As to the\n\novertime boycotts, the court stated that it \"would be uncomfortable\n\nordering employees to do what [VNE] itself characterizes as a\n\nvoluntary act,\" and that VNE had not shown that the overtime\n\nboycotts posed a \"substantial hardship.\"             Id.   As to the alleged\n\npicketing, it held that any effort \"to define in the abstract when\n\npicketing is or is not lawful (or appropriate) is a hopeless task\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fgiven the myriad forms that speech can take in the context of a\n\nlabor dispute.\"    Id.\n\n          This    articulation   mischaracterizes   VNE's   request   for\n\ndeclaratory relief, which went to the four alleged CBA violations\n\nand sought a declaration as to their legal effects.         VNE did not\n\nrequest that the court define in the abstract when picketing is\n\nlawful, nor did it request that the court issue a declaratory order\n\nrequiring employees to volunteer for overtime. Nor did VNE rest its\n\nrequest for declaratory relief on the premise that work stoppages\n\nand Union communications about company tools would continue to occur\n\nin the future as they had in the past.       Rather, VNE requested a\n\ndeclaration as to the lawfulness of the particular acts described\n\nin its complaint under the no-strike clause of the CBA.\n\n          The dispute about the legal effect of these four alleged\n\nviolations is clearly ripe, as Article III requires.        The actions\n\nhave happened; it is the legal effects of these actions under the\n\nno-strike clause and LMRA § 301 that are at issue. \"There is little\n\ndifficulty in finding an actual controversy if all of the acts that\n\nare alleged to create liability have already occurred.        The court\n\nis then merely being asked, as in any litigation, to determine the\n\nlegal consequences of past events . . . .\"    10B Charles Alan Wright\n\net al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2757, at 475 (1998).         VNE\n\nseeks a declaration that the Union's past actions contravened the\n\nno-strike clause of the CBA and frustrated the company's bargained-\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\ffor quid pro quo that such matters be resolved through arbitration.\n\nThis is not a situation where a declaration is sought on the legal\n\nconsequences of a hypothetical act that may or may not occur in the\n\nfuture.   Id. at 475-476.\n\n           Nor does a decision that the harm to VNE does not warrant\n\npreliminary injunctive relief preclude an examination of whether VNE\n\nshould nonetheless be granted a declaratory judgment.                See Powell\n\nv.   McCormack,   395   U.S.   486,    499    (1969)   (\"A   court    may   grant\n\ndeclaratory relief even though it chooses not to issue an injunction\n\nor mandamus.\").    More than that, \"a federal district court has the\n\nduty to decide the appropriateness and the merits of the declaratory\n\nrequest irrespective of its conclusion as to the propriety of the\n\nissuance of the injunctions.\"         Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 254\n\n(1967).   The DJA itself states that declaratory judgment may be\n\ngranted \"whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\"                 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2201(a). The Act embodies the view that declaratory relief\n\nis alternative or cumulative, and not extraordinary relief.                    10\n\nWright et al., supra § 2758, at 508.\n\n           Further,     this   court    has    recognized    the     utility   of\n\ndeclaratory judgments in cases brought under § 301 of the LMRA in\n\nwhich injunctive relief is denied.           In Tejidos de Coamo, this court\n\nremanded for consideration of a request for declaratory relief in\n\na § 301 LMRA action where we had reversed the grant of injunctive\n\nrelief:\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\f           Although section 301 actions are ordinarily\n           brought to enforce contracts, the Declaratory\n           Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, permits the\n           declaration of rights about which a real\n           controversy exists, and the Unions have not\n           disputed the district court's authority to\n           grant declaratory relief.\n\nTejidos de Coamo,          22 F.3d at 15.        Importantly, Tejidos also\n\nemphasized that the constraints on injunctions in Boys Markets type\n\ncases do not apply to the relief of declaratory judgment.                 As we\n\nsaid, \"Nor does section 7 [of the NLA, 29 U.S.C. § 107] pose any\n\nbarrier   to   such    a    declaration;    it   is    directed   only   against\n\ninjunctions.\"    Id.       The NLA provides no protection against actions\n\nfor declaratory relief.        Wilkes-Barr Pub. Co. v. Newspaper Guild of\n\nWilkes-Barre, Local 120, 647 F.2d 372, 379 (3d Cir. 1981).\n\n           Even if an injunction is unwarranted, an adjudication as\n\nto whether the events at issue in this litigation establish CBA\n\nviolations that undercut the arbitral process could be of assistance\n\nin settling the underlying controversy.               Whether there has been a\n\npattern of evasion of arbitration through violations of a no-strike\n\nprovision is highly relevant to whether future injunctive relief\n\nshould be granted if the pattern recurs.               See Latas Libby's, 609\n\nF.2d at 31-32; see also Powell, 395 U.S. at 499.                  Future relief\n\naside, declaratory relief can have a current utility.              As the Third\n\nCircuit noted in affirming a denial of injunctive relief but\n\nremanding for consideration of declaratory relief, a \"declaration\n\nthat . . . breaches did or did not occur certainly would aid the\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fparties   in   understanding   their    mutual   obligations   under   the\n\ncontract.\"     Bituminous Coal Operators' Ass'n, Inc. v.

United Mine Workers\n\nof Am., 444 U.S. 212, 216 & n.4 (1979).\n\n           If we thought VNE's claims were easily rejected on their\n\nmerits, we would not remand.     But that is not the case.     Certain of\n\nthe claims that these actions by the Union have violated VNE's\n\nrights    under    the   CBA   are    substantial   and   merit   serious\n\nconsideration.     Declaratory relief, of course, may not be used to\n\nsupplant the role of the arbitrator in interpreting the provisions\n\nof the contract.    It may be useful, however, in determining whether\n\nthe actions at issue have undercut the arbitral process.

Lichten, with whom Timothy Belcher, Lichten &amp; Liss-Riordan, P.C., Alfred Gordon, and Pyle Rome Ehrenberg, P.C. were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>This appeal arises from a denial of injunctive relief against a union under <i>Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local 770,</i> 398 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970), and § 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. § 185, as well as a denial of declaratory relief concerning actions previously taken by that union. We affirm the denial of injunctive relief, vacate the denial of declaratory relief, and remand.</p>\n<p>Verizon New England, Inc. (VNE) alleges that the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 2322 (the Union) violated a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) no-strike clause on four occasions in 2008 and 2009. VNE argues that these acts were part of a pattern of behavior undercutting the arbitral process that warrants federal court relief. It alleges that the Union did not comply with the CBA when its members (1) made representations that the Union would fine members who brought required devices to work, (2) engaged in a short but concerted work stoppage, (3) coordinated refusals to volunteer for overtime work, and (4) protested at a VNE facility each morning for several weeks. VNE seeks injunctive relief and, in the alternative, declaratory relief in furtherance of the arbitral process.</p>\n<p>The district court granted the Union's motion for summary judgment, finding that VNE had not shown future harm and declining to issue either injunctive or declaratory relief. <i>Verizon New England, Inc. v. Local No. 2322, Int'l. Bhd. of Elec. Workers,</i> No. 09-10165-RGS, 2010 WL 3282605 (D.Mass. Aug. 20, 2010). Because a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction must meet the traditional standards for injunctive relief and because VNE has not, at this point, demonstrated irreparable injury, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of injunctive relief. However, because we believe the district court misapprehended the relevant legal standard for declaratory relief, we vacate the denial of that relief and remand for further consideration of the issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The CBA, effective from August 3, 2008 until August 6, 2011, contains a no-strike clause at Article G10. The clause provides,</p>\n<blockquote>The Union agrees that during the term of this Agreement, or any extension thereof, it will not cause or permit its members to cause, nor will any member of the Union take part in, any strike of or interference with any of the Company's operations or picketing of any of the Company's premises.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> Notably, the clause prohibits interference with operations and picketing of company premises in addition to strikes. It also imposes obligations on the Union with respect to both its own conduct and the conduct of its members.</p>\n<p>Under Article G8 of the CBA, the Union may submit to a grievance process any \"complaint involving the interpretation or application of any provisions of this Agreement\" and any \"complaint that an employee or group of employees for whom the Union is the bargaining agent has, in any manner, been unfairly treated.\" After the conclusion of the final step of the grievance procedure, under Article G9 the Union may demand arbitration when it believes \"the intent and meaning of one or more of the Articles of this Agreement ... has been violated by the Company,\" provided that certain procedural prerequisites have been met. The CBA allows for expedited arbitration for \"any grievance involving the suspension of an individual employee.\"</p>\n<p>The CBA does not permit VNE to invoke the grievance procedure to institute the process leading toward arbitration. Only the Union may do so, and VNE contends that the Union's failure to invoke these procedures led to this lawsuit. Rather than follow the grievance process, VNE asserts, the Union and its members have taken \"self-help\" measures in violation of the no-strike clause. In its complaint, VNE focused on what it asserts are four such prohibited self-help measures. One of these alleged violations was in response to a new company rule concerning the transport of company tools, while the remaining three alleged violations followed an altercation between a Union member and his supervisor.</p>\n<p>VNE has sought to place these instances within the context of a previous pattern of conduct it claims violated the no-strike clause. Most of these incidents involved other locals: Locals 2321, 2324, and 2222. As to incidents involving other locals, VNE asserts that since 2007 there have been two alleged incidents of picketing, a \"sit-down\" strike, a boycott of overtime, and pressures by local representatives to reduce productivity. VNE also alleges that there have been \"[p]eriodic efforts\" by \"several Locals to discourage bargaining unit employees from accepting temporary assignments to management positions going back to the mid-1980s.\" As to incidents involving Local 2322, the defendant here, VNE notes that members protested the discipline of an employee in 2001 by engaging in a \"sick out,\" which was enjoined by <i>Verizon New England, Inc. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,</i> No. 01-11636, slip op. at 1-2 (D.Mass. Nov. 17, 2001).</p>\n<p>The first of the four alleged violations at the core of this suit followed the introduction of a company rule that employees transport company-issued tool kits between job sites. An earlier rule had required only that tools be on the job site with the employee. For Equipment Installation Technicians (EI Techs), employees who are routinely assigned to work on lengthy projects at remote locations in the field, company-issued tool kits included cell phones equipped with global positioning capabilities. Some EI Techs, apparently concerned that VNE might use the phones to track their movements, refused to comply with the new rule. VNE disciplined two employees for non-compliance with the rule shortly after it was issued, and the Union grieved these disciplinary actions.</p>\n<p>In addition to filing these grievances, the Union established a set of \"EI Work Rules.\" The chief steward for EI Techs, Katherine Crowley, drafted these rules after confirming with the Union's business manager and highest official, Eugene McLaughlin, that the EI Techs could create <span class=\"star-pagination\">*181</span> such rules and after confirming with the Union's assistant business manager, Chris Jolls, that such rules could be enforced by fines. One rule stated that it was the Union's position that employees must be paid to travel or transport any company tools they choose to carry on personal time. The rule instructed EI Techs to claim overtime and travel expenses, and stated that if overtime and travel expenses were denied, \"this must be grieved.\" It continued, \"[t]his is not negotiable and is contractual.\"</p>\n<p>The EI Techs adopted the rules at a Union meeting. Shortly thereafter, on January 8, 2009, Crowley sent an email to Union members. The email stated, \"The decision has been made to enforce the union E.I. Work Rule number one in regard to the tools. The union stance is as follows, <i>do not transport any tools (except for the 3 items under protest)</i> for the manager[s].... You could be subject to answer ... for your actions and a possible fine....\" After Crowley sent this email, McLaughlin called her and told her not to send any more email messages. Crowley was not told why she should not send any additional emails, however, nor was she told to retract the email. She received no instruction as to how to enforce the EI Work Rules, and remained a chief steward.</p>\n<p>VNE alleges that only one EI Tech did not comply with the EI Work Rules, and that he was spoken to by many of the other employees. The Union, by contrast, alleges that no EI Tech ever failed to actually carry the company's tools. On this motion for summary judgment, we must take any conflict in the evidence in the light most favorable to VNE, the non-moving party. It is undisputed that no employees were disciplined by the Union for failing to comply with the EI Work Rules.</p>\n<p>The three other alleged violations at the core of this suit followed an August 25, 2009 confrontation between a splice-service technician (SST), Peter Sem, and his supervisor, Patty Regan, in a parking lot next to the VNE garage in Brockton where they worked. The facts concerning the altercation are disputed, though again we must take the facts in the light most favorable to VNE, the non-moving party. VNE alleges that Sem was drinking and that when Regan approached with a camera he assaulted her and broke the camera.<sup>[1]</sup> VNE suspended and later fired Sem as a result of the altercation. Regan also filed a criminal complaint against him; Sem was placed on probation and ordered to pay Regan $313 in restitution.</p>\n<p>The second alleged violation of Article G10 occurred a few days after the altercation, on August 28, 2009. That morning, all the employees in the garage refused to work until they had spoken to a third-level supervisor, Lance Cummings. The garage's chief steward, Bob Wall, told a first-level supervisor, Michael Shea, that the employees felt unsafe around Regan. Shea responded that Cummings would not come to the garage and that the employees needed to return to work. The employees did not return to work, and after about forty-five minutes Shea told them that if they did not return to work within five minutes they would be suspended. In the ensuing five minutes, during which only a few employees returned to work, Shea contacted the Union's new business manager, Erik Hetrick. Shea informed Hetrick that VNE was about to suspend almost all of the employees at the garage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*182</span> Hetrick requested that Shea delay any suspensions until he could get to the garage, and drove from the Union headquarters in Middleboro to the garage in Brockton. Once Hetrick arrived he spoke with the employees and reassured Shea that he believed the situation would resolve itself. He then called Cummings and requested that Regan not interact with the employees until after a representative from VNE's Employee Assistance Plan had spoken with them the following Monday. After Cummings accepted that request, the employees returned to work. VNE estimates that this work stoppage delayed the start of the work day by between an hour and an hour and a half, and argues that the stoppage violated the no-strike clause in Article G10. The Union submits that the delay was shorter, but we take the estimate of VNE, the non-moving party.</p>\n<p>VNE alleges that a third violation of Article G10 also began on August 28, 2009, when employees at the Brockton garage who had previously made themselves available to work voluntary overtime refused to work that overtime. VNE's Director of Labor Relations, Joseph Santos, informed Hetrick in a letter dated the same day that the employees declining overtime were acting \"in protest of a dispute subject to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement.\" The letter stated that the Union's obligations under Article G10 of the agreement required that it not permit such interference with VNE's operations. Santos requested that Hetrick inform him of the actions the Union was taking to restore voluntary overtime. Hetrick responded by fax stating that it was the Union's position that it had satisfied its obligations under Article G10. By September 3, 2009, every SST in the Union was refusing voluntary overtime.</p>\n<p>Finally, VNE alleges that employees at the Brockton garage violated the no-strike clause of the CBA by picketing the entrance to the garage. It is undisputed that on September 1, 2009, about twenty EI Techs began protesting in front of the Brockton garage each morning between 7:15 and 7:30. The employees walked between the two entrances of the garage and some carried signs. The Union denies that it organized these actions, but it acknowledges that Hetrick and other Union leaders participated. The Union has conceded that these protests lasted a few weeks.</p>\n<p>In its supplemental complaint, VNE argued that these actions interfered with VNE's business and that the Union failed to meet its obligations to prevent and eliminate these interferences. It argued that the alleged CBA violations caused irreparable injury to VNE by undermining the grievance and arbitration provisions of the CBA and by injuring VNE's goodwill among customers in the telecommunications field. VNE acknowledged that the damages resulting from these alleged harms were not \"readily ascertainable,\" and has not pursued the request for damages it nonetheless included in its complaint. It has focused on the two other forms of relief it requested: injunctive relief and declaratory relief. The proposed injunctive relief would enjoin the Union to take adequate steps to prevent future strike activities.</p>\n<p>The Union sought summary judgment arguing that VNE had failed to identify a violation of the no-strike clause and that in any case VNE had failed to show that any violations had caused damages or irreparable harm. It argued that (1) VNE had not found that any employee refused to carry company tools as directed by VNE, and at any rate the Union was not responsible for the actions of a rogue Union steward directing members not to follow the policy; (2) the Union acted swiftly to resolve the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*183</span> initial protest at the Brockton garage and prevented it from causing any harm to VNE; (3) VNE employees were entitled to refuse voluntary overtime because VNE may compel mandatory overtime, and the fact that VNE did not compel mandatory overtime demonstrates that it was not harmed by this refusal; and (4) the protests held outside of the Brockton garage did not constitute picketing, and at any rate did not cause VNE any harm. Further, the Union argued, VNE had available contract remedies; that is, VNE could have suspended employees, provoking the Union to start the arbitral process.</p>\n<p>Without detailing all of VNE's responses, it is quite clear that the Union was not entitled to summary judgment based on its defense that there neither was nor could have been a breach of the CBA's no-strike clause. At the very least, there were facts in dispute and the Union's attempt to disclaim any responsibility is unfounded. VNE provided evidence that the purportedly rogue Union steward acted with the Union's approval and complicity, that the sit-down strike and picketing were a classic example of wink/wink, nod/nod by Union officials, and that at least the voluntary overtime boycott affected its operations.</p>\n<p>The district court did not assess the evidence as to whether CBA violations had occurred. Instead, it assessed the level of harm to VNE and the ongoing nature of the alleged violations. The district court granted summary judgment for the Union on VNE's request for injunctive relief, finding that VNE had not alleged any ongoing breach of the CBA and had not adequately alleged either irreparable harm or a threat of a future CBA breach. <i>Verizon New England,</i> 2010 WL 3282605, at *5-7.</p>\n<p>The district court also granted summary judgment for the Union on VNE's request for declaratory relief, finding that two of the four alleged CBA violations presented no threat of recurrence, and that declarations concerning the remaining two violations would be too abstract and uncertain to warrant this form of relief. <i>Id.</i> at *7.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The Norris-La Guardia Act of 1932 (NLA) prohibited federal courts from granting injunctive relief in labor disputes. 29 U.S.C. § 104. In 1947, however, Congress enacted the LMRA, which gave federal courts jurisdiction over suits alleging violations of collective bargaining agreements. 29 U.S.C. § 185(a). In the 1950s, the use of arbitration to resolve labor disputes became a central and controlling component of federal labor policy. <i>See </i><i>Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills,</i> 353 U.S. 448, 455, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957). In the <i>Steelworkers</i> trilogy in 1960, moreover, the Supreme Court strengthened the requirement for arbitration under collective bargaining agreements. <i>See </i><i>United Steelworkers v. Am. Mfg. Co.,</i> 363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960); <i>United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co.,</i> 363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960); <i>United Steelworkers v. Enter. Wheel &amp; Car Corp.,</i> 363 U.S. 593, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960).</p>\n<p>There was some tension between the NLA, the LMRA, and this emphasis on arbitration. The Supreme Court found there was a need for some adjustment of the prohibition against enjoining strikes contained in the NLA in light of the LMRA and the use of arbitration. In <i>Boys Markets</i><sup>[2]</sup> the Court held that, despite <span class=\"star-pagination\">*184</span> the anti-injunction provisions of § 4 of the NLA, a federal court in LMRA § 301(a) cases may issue limited injunctive relief to protect the effectiveness of arbitration agreements:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he very purpose of arbitration procedures is to provide a mechanism for the expeditious settlement of industrial disputes without resort to strikes, lockouts, or other self-help measures. This basic purpose is obviously largely undercut if there is no immediate, effective remedy for those very tactics that arbitration is designed to obviate.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Boys Markets,</i> 398 U.S. at 249, 90 S.Ct. 1583. The Court expressed concern that incentives for employers to agree to submit grievances to arbitration would be inappropriately dissipated<sup>[3]</sup> if employers were deprived of injunctive relief to enforce the quid pro quo of a no-strike clause.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 248, 90 S.Ct. 1583.</p>\n<p>In <i>Boys Markets,</i> the Supreme Court established certain preconditions for the issuance of injunctive relief in labor disputes: (a) the existence of a no-strike clause, (b) clarity that the grievance in question was subject to arbitration, and (c) employer readiness to engage in such arbitration. <i>Id.</i> at 253-54, 90 S.Ct. 1583. In addition to these preconditions, there are other limitations on the grant of a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction. The injunction must also meet all the usual criteria for injunctive relief, including irreparable injury, likelihood of success on the merits, balancing of the equities, and consideration of the public interest. <i>Id.</i> at 254, 90 S.Ct. 1583. Further, the Court held that an employer \"should be ordered to arbitrate, as a condition of ... obtaining an injunction against the strike.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson,</i> 370 U.S. 195, 228, 82 S.Ct. 1328, 8 L.Ed.2d 440 (1962) (Brennan, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p>Many years ago this Court held there are three conditions for injunctive relief under <i>Boys Markets:</i> \"(1) the collective bargaining agreement must contain mandatory arbitration procedures; (2) the strike to be enjoined must be over an arbitrable grievance; and (3) `ordinary principles of equity' must warrant the injunctive relief.\" <i>Nat'l Elevator Indus.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*185</span> <i>Inc. v. Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors,</i> 776 F.2d 374, 376-77 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting <i>Int'l Detective Serv., Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 251,</i> 614 F.2d 29, 31 (1st Cir.1980)). The first two of these conditions are clearly met in this case. As to the first, there is no question that the collective bargaining agreement contains mandatory arbitration procedures. As to the second, the presumption of arbitrability applies in <i>Boys Markets</i> cases, <i>see </i><i>Gateway Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers,</i> 414 U.S. 368, 379-82, 94 S.Ct. 629, 38 L.Ed.2d 583 (1974), and the disputes at issue here certainly appear to be over arbitral grievances. The third condition presents a steeper climb for VNE.</p>\n<p>Our analysis is informed by both statutory constraints and limits stemming from the rationale for the <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction. As to statutory restrictions, <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctions are limited by § 9 of the NLA, which requires that injunctions contain \"only a prohibition of such specific act or acts as may be expressly complained of in the ... complaint or petition filed\" in the case. 29 U.S.C. § 109; <i>Latas Libby's, Inc. v. United Steelworkers,</i> 609 F.2d 25, 31 (1st Cir.1979).<sup>[5]</sup> As to limits stemming from the rationale in <i>Boys Markets,</i> the Supreme Court has held that a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction can only issue if the dispute is \"over\" issues which the striking union is obligated to arbitrate. <i>Buffalo Forge Co. v. United Steelworkers,</i> 428 U.S. 397, 407, 96 S.Ct. 3141, 49 L.Ed.2d 1022 (1976). In so holding, the Court responded to risks that employers would seek court determinations on issues of arbitrability meant to be left to arbitrators.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Buffalo Forge,</i> the underlying grievance, not just the activity to be enjoined, must be governed by the arbitration requirement. If there were no requirement to arbitrate that grievance, any injunction could hardly be in aid of arbitration. <i>Id.</i> When it is clear the strike is not \"over\" such issues, no injunction may issue. In <i>Buffalo Forge,</i> the Court held that it was error to issue a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction against a sympathy strike which \"had neither the purpose nor the effect of denying or evading an obligation to arbitrate or of depriving the employer of its bargain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 407-408, 96 S.Ct. 3141. The Supreme Court reinforced this requirement in <i>Jacksonville Bulk Terminals v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n,</i> 457 U.S. 702, 102 S.Ct. 2672, 73 L.Ed.2d 327 (1982), holding that a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction should not issue to stop a politically motivated boycott that was plainly not arbitrable. <i>Id.</i> at 721, 102 S.Ct. 2672.</p>\n<p>This court has read <i>Boys Markets</i> such that frustration of the arbitral process does not necessarily establish irreparable injury for purposes of injunctive relief. In <i>Latas Libby's,</i> we affirmed a district court's finding that a union had violated a no-strike clause and affirmed the district court's award of damages for the illegal strike. <i>Latas Libby's,</i> 609 F.2d at 28-30. We vacated, however, prospective injunctive relief as to future strikes. The injunction had required the union to comply in all future actions with the no-strike clause of the CBA. <i>Id.</i> at 30. This court held that given that the record disclosed no prior violations of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*186</span> the no-strike agreement, the prospective injunctive relief went further than needed. <i>Id.</i> at 30-32. We commented, \"[a]lthough we do not say that repeated violations of a no-strike covenant never warrant broad prospective relief, in the absence of any showing here of a continuing course of conduct evidencing the unwillingness of the Union to abide by the no-strike provision,\" the district court's injunction was too broad to stand. <i>Id.</i> We also noted that the broad relief granted would violate § 9 of the NLA. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n<p>This court has also reaffirmed the requirement that injunctive relief may only be granted under <i>Boys Markets</i> in furtherance of the arbitral process. In <i>Tejidos de Coamo, Inc. v. International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union,</i> 22 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 1994), we held that an order on behalf of an employer staying arbitration, <i>id.</i> at 11, was an immediately appealable injunction and that the injunction was not validly issued under <i>Boys Markets, see id.</i> at 12-13. There, injunctive relief could not be justified \"on either ground  to enforce a contract or support arbitration  let alone both.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12. That an order staying arbitration could not be in support of arbitration was self-evident. <i>Id.</i> The company argued that there was no contract requiring arbitration and that it could not be forced into arbitration. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In addition to vacating overly broad injunctive relief and injunctive relief that did not advance the arbitral process, this court has also reversed grants of <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctive relief for failure to meet the traditional four-part equitable test. <i>See </i><i>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Teamsters Local No. 633,</i> 511 F.2d 1097, 1100 (1st Cir.1975) (holding that the balance of relative harms to the parties showed employer did not meet its burden).</p>\n<p>Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has imposed any requirements as to the sequence of decision making on issues presented by <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction requests. <i>Cf. </i><i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> 555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, 818-21, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (holding that there is no mandatory order of decisionmaking in qualified immunity cases). There is no reason why the district court could not jump, as it did, to the irreparable injury issue, and so we turn to that. We review denials of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion, reviewing underlying legal questions de novo. <i>Animal Welfare Inst. v. Martin,</i> 623 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>VNE argues that the district court made several errors in its denial of injunctive relief. Primarily, it argues the court misapprehended the nature of the harm at issue by measuring the direct harm caused by each alleged CBA violation.<sup>[6]</sup> VNE argues that the court should have taken the four alleged violations as a whole and assessed \"the harm to the arbitral process caused by the Union's repeated resort to picketing and strikes over matters the Union seems to agree are subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the CBA.\"</p>\n<p>In the more common case in which <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctions have been issued, the strike is occurring at the time of suit or is imminent. <i>See</i> 1 John E. Higgins, Jr., <i>The Developing Labor Law</i> 1461 (5th ed. 2006). <i>Boys Markets</i> itself concerned an ongoing violation of a no-strike clause. <i>Boys Markets,</i> 398 U.S. at 239-40, 90 S.Ct. 1583. In theory, questions may arise as to the application of <i>Boys Markets</i> to job actions short <span class=\"star-pagination\">*187</span> of actual strikes. But we have held that activities short of an actual strike may also violate no-strike clauses, including work slowdowns and concerted refusals to work overtime.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Nat'l Elevator Indus.,</i> 776 F.2d 374; <i>see also </i><i>Avco Corp. v. Local Union #787, UAW,</i> 459 F.2d 968, 974 (3d Cir.1972) (holding that concerted refusals to work overtime fell within the proscriptions of a CBA no-strike clause and were subject to injunctive relief under <i>Boys Markets</i>).</p>\n<p>The fact that there is no present ongoing dispute as to these four alleged violations does not, of course, mean the case is moot. <i>See </i><i>Jacksonville Bulk Terminals,</i> 457 U.S. at 704 n. 1, 102 S.Ct. 2672 (suit by employer under LMRA § 301 is not mooted by cessation of work stoppage). But that fact does go to the issue of irreparable harm. Patterns of repeated past strikes in violation of no-strike clauses may support issuance of prospective injunctive relief even when there is no ongoing strike. As the district court recognized, however, in this case the four alleged job actions were not full-blown strikes, nor do the alleged actions establish a repeated pattern giving rise to ongoing harm. VNE's assertion that the four alleged breaches threaten \"death by pin pricks,\" <i>Verizon New England,</i> 2010 WL 3282605, at *7 n. 7, is insufficient. The district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the threshold of irreparable injury had not been met.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court has indicated that appellate review of discretionary decisions not to grant declaratory relief is generally for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Wilton v. Seven Falls Co.,</i> 515 U.S. 277, 289-90, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995). It has \"repeatedly characterized the Declaratory Judgment Act as `an enabling Act, which confers a discretion on the courts rather than an absolute right upon the litigant.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 287, 115 S.Ct. 2137 (quoting <i>Pub. Serv. Comm'n of Utah v. Wycoff Co.,</i> 344 U.S. 237, 241, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952)). The Court has not yet established the contours of that abuse of discretion review except in cases where the denial is based on there being a parallel proceeding which presents the opportunity to ventilate the same state law issues in the state courts. <i>See id.</i> at 290, 115 S.Ct. 2137. <i>Wilton</i> expressly declined \"to delineate the outer boundaries of that discretion\" in cases raising issues of federal law, <i>id.,</i> such as the case before us.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*188</span> Out of caution, we apply an abuse of discretion standard of review to all aspects of the denial of a declaratory judgment here, with the important caveat that errors of law constitute an abuse of discretion. <i>Voice of the Arab World, Inc. v. MDTV Med. News Now, Inc.,</i> 645 F.3d 26, 30-31 (1st Cir.2011). At any rate, we reach the same result under any standard of review. <i>See </i><i>Rossi v. Gemma,</i> 489 F.3d 26, 38 n. 21 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>We start with the basics. Requests for a declaratory judgment may not be granted unless they arise in a context of a controversy \"ripe\" for judicial resolution. <i>Abbott Labs. v. Gardner,</i> 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Califano v. Sanders,</i> 430 U.S. 99, 105, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). Ripeness is an Article III jurisdictional requirement. The need for ripeness is emphasized in the Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA), 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), which refers to an \"actual\" controversy. This is a sine qua non of any assumption of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>In <i>Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Economic Protection Corp.,</i> 45 F.3d 530 (1st Cir.1995), we interpreted <i>Abbott Labs.</i> to hold that where challenges are asserted to government actions and ripeness questions arise, a court must consider both \"fitness\" for review and \"hardship.\" <i>Id.</i> at 535. The \"fitness\" inquiry concerns questions of finality, definiteness, and the need for further factual development. <i>Id.</i> Under \"hardship,\" the court should consider whether the challenged action \"creates a `direct and immediate' dilemma\" for the parties. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. EPA,</i> 959 F.2d 360, 364 (1st Cir.1992)). As we have reaffirmed since our decision in <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> these inquiries are highly fact-dependent, such that the \"various integers that enter into the ripeness equation play out quite differently from case to case.\" <i>Doe v. Bush,</i> 323 F.3d 133, 138 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 45 F.3d at 535).</p>\n<p>Before the district court, the Union argued that declaratory relief should not be granted because VNE's allegations were not of \"sufficient immediacy or controversy\" to warrant the exercise of the court's discretion. It argued that the controversy was no longer ongoing, and that VNE had not shown that the arbitral process had failed to function properly. In <i>State of R.I. v. Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> 19 F.3d 685 (1st Cir.1994), we rejected such a confined approach to considering the question of \"hardship.\" In that case, we firmly held that \"this part of the [ripeness] inquiry should focus on the judgment's usefulness.\" <i>Id.</i> at 693. We held that \"[r]ather than asking, negatively, whether denying relief would impose hardship, courts will do well to ask, in a more positive vein, whether granting relief would serve a useful purpose, or, put another way, whether the sought-after declaration would be of practical assistance in setting the underlying controversy to rest.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The district court identified this governing standard, but its analysis did not comport with the standard's requirements. The court concluded that the first two of the four claimed CBA violations could not meet the ripeness requirement because \"they pertain to discrete past incidents that present no threat of recurrence.\" <i>Verizon New England,</i> 2010 WL 3282605, at *7. It allowed that there could be possible future harm to VNE from renewed boycotts of voluntary overtime or wildcat picketing, but held it would be inappropriate to comment on future <span class=\"star-pagination\">*189</span> events. <i>Id.</i> As to the overtime boycotts, the court stated that it \"would be uncomfortable ordering employees to do what [VNE] itself characterizes as a voluntary act,\" and that VNE had not shown that the overtime boycotts posed a \"substantial hardship.\" <i>Id.</i> As to the alleged picketing, it held that any effort \"to define in the abstract when picketing is or is not lawful (or appropriate) is a hopeless task given the myriad forms that speech can take in the context of a labor dispute.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This articulation mischaracterizes VNE's request for declaratory relief, which went to the four alleged CBA violations and sought a declaration as to their legal effects. VNE did not request that the court define in the abstract when picketing is lawful, nor did it request that the court issue a declaratory order requiring employees to volunteer for overtime. Nor did VNE rest its request for declaratory relief on the premise that work stoppages and Union communications about company tools would continue to occur in the future as they had in the past. Rather, VNE requested a declaration as to the lawfulness of the particular acts described in its complaint under the no-strike clause of the CBA.</p>\n<p>The dispute about the legal effect of these four alleged violations is clearly ripe, as Article III requires. The actions have happened; it is the legal effects of these actions under the no-strike clause and LMRA § 301 that are at issue. \"There is little difficulty in finding an actual controversy if all of the acts that are alleged to create liability have already occurred. The court is then merely being asked, as in any litigation, to determine the legal consequences of past events....\" 10B Charles Alan Wright et al., <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 2757, at 475 (1998). VNE seeks a declaration that the Union's past actions contravened the no-strike clause of the CBA and frustrated the company's bargained-for quid pro quo that such matters be resolved through arbitration. This is not a situation where a declaration is sought on the legal consequences of a hypothetical act that may or may not occur in the future. <i>Id.</i> at 475-476.</p>\n<p>Nor does a decision that the harm to VNE does not warrant preliminary injunctive relief preclude an examination of whether VNE should nonetheless be granted a declaratory judgment. <i>See </i><i>Powell v. McCormack,</i> 395 U.S. 486, 499, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969) (\"A court may grant declaratory relief even though it chooses not to issue an injunction or mandamus.\"). More than that, \"a federal district court has the duty to decide the appropriateness and the merits of the declaratory request irrespective of its conclusion as to the propriety of the issuance of the injunctions.\" <i>Zwickler v. Koota,</i> 389 U.S. 241, 254, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967). The DJA itself states that declaratory judgment may be granted \"whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). The Act embodies the view that declaratory relief is alternative or cumulative, and not extraordinary relief. 10B Wright et al., <i>supra</i> § 2758, at 508.</p>\n<p>Further, this court has recognized the utility of declaratory judgments in cases brought under § 301 of the LMRA in which injunctive relief is denied. In <i>Tejidos de Coamo,</i> this court remanded for consideration of a request for declaratory relief in a § 301 LMRA action where we had reversed the grant of injunctive relief:</p>\n<blockquote>Although section 301 actions are ordinarily brought to enforce contracts, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, permits the declaration of rights about which a real controversy exists, and the Unions have not disputed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*190</span> the district court's authority to grant declaratory relief.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Tejidos de Coamo,</i> 22 F.3d at 15. Importantly, <i>Tejidos</i> also emphasized that the constraints on injunctions in <i>Boys Markets</i> type cases do not apply to the relief of declaratory judgment. As we said, \"Nor does section 7 [of the NLA, 29 U.S.C. § 107] pose any barrier to such a declaration; it is directed only against injunctions.\" <i>Id.</i> The NLA provides no protection against actions for declaratory relief. <i>Wilkes-Barre Pub. Co. v. Newspaper Guild of Wilkes-Barre, Local 120,</i> 647 F.2d 372, 379 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p>Even if an injunction is unwarranted, an adjudication as to whether the events at issue in this litigation establish CBA violations that undercut the arbitral process could be of assistance in settling the underlying controversy. Whether there has been a pattern of evasion of arbitration through violations of a no-strike provision is highly relevant to whether future injunctive relief should be granted if the pattern recurs. <i>See </i><i>Latas Libby's,</i> 609 F.2d at 31-32; <i>see also </i><i>Powell,</i> 395 U.S. at 499, 89 S.Ct. 1944. Future relief aside, declaratory relief can have a current utility. As the Third Circuit noted in affirming a denial of injunctive relief but remanding for consideration of declaratory relief, a \"declaration that ... breaches did or did not occur certainly would aid the parties in understanding their mutual obligations under the contract.\" <i>Bituminous Coal Operators' Ass'n, Inc. v. Int'l Union, United Mine Workers of Am.,</i> 585 F.2d 586, 595 (3d Cir.1978), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Carbon Fuel Co. v. United Mine Workers of Am.,</i> 444 U.S. 212, 216 &amp; n. 4, 100 S.Ct. 410, 62 L.Ed.2d 394 (1979).</p>\n<p>If we thought VNE's claims were easily rejected on their merits, we would not remand. But that is not the case. Certain of the claims that these actions by the Union have violated VNE's rights under the CBA are substantial and merit serious consideration. Declaratory relief, of course, may not be used to supplant the role of the arbitrator in interpreting the provisions of the contract. It may be useful, however, in determining whether the actions at issue have undercut the arbitral process. <i>Cf. </i><i>Buffalo Forge,</i> 428 U.S. at 407, 96 S.Ct. 3141.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>We affirm the denial of injunctive relief, reverse the denial of declaratory relief, and remand for further consideration of declaratory relief. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Union contends that Regan accosted Sem and that, as Sem attempted to defend himself, Regan dropped her camera.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Boys Markets</i> overruled <i>Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson,</i> 370 U.S. 195, 82 S.Ct. 1328, 8 L.Ed.2d 440 (1962), an earlier effort among a series of efforts to reconcile these tensions. <i>See </i><i>Boys Mkts., Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local 770,</i> 398 U.S. 235, 237-38, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970); <i>see generally,</i> Paula L. McDonald, Comment, <i>Judicial Interpretation of Collective Bargaining Agreements: The Danger Inherent in the Determination of Arbitrability,</i> 1983 Duke L.J. 848, 853-57.</p>\n<p>[3]  VNE is not precluded from <i>Boys Markets</i> relief by the fact that only the Union could institute the grievances and arbitration processes under the CBA. Once arbitration is sought, both parties are bound to arbitrate. If the Union grieves, then VNE must follow the procedures through arbitration. That is all that <i>Boys Markets,</i> with its statement that \"both parties are contractually bound\" to arbitrate, 398 U.S. at 254, 90 S.Ct. 1583, requires. <i>See also </i><i>Avco Corp. v. Local Union #787,</i> 459 F.2d 968, 972 (3d Cir.1972). Indeed, one-way grievance ratchets may increase the likelihood of employers seeking <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctions. In any event, the Union has not asserted that the normal rules for <i>Boys Markets</i> cases are somehow altered by the fact that the CBA in this case contains such a one-way ratchet.</p>\n<p>[4]  Some courts have recognized what is called \"the reverse <i>Boys Markets</i> exception.\" <i>Aeronautical Indus. Dist. Lodge 91 v. United Techs. Corp.,</i> 230 F.3d 569 (2d Cir.2000). This exception \"permits unions to obtain injunctions against employers to preserve the status quo pending arbitration of a labor dispute as long as: (1) the underlying dispute is subject to mandatory arbitration; and (2) an injunction is necessary to prevent the arbitration process from becoming a `hollow formality' or `meaningless ritual.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 581 (quoting <i>Niagara Hooker Emps. Union v. Occidental Chem. Corp.,</i> 935 F.2d 1370, 1377 (2d Cir.1991)); <i>see also </i><i>Lever Bros. Co. v. Int'l Chem. Workers Union,</i> 554 F.2d 115, 123 (4th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p>[5]  While this circuit apparently has not reached the question, <i>see </i><i>Otis Elevator Co. v. Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors, Local 4,</i> 408 F.3d 1, 7 n. 5 (1st Cir.2005), most courts have concluded that the requirements of § 7 of the NLA also apply to <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctions. That section, 29 U.S.C. § 107, specifies certain procedural and evidentiary requirements. <i>See</i> 1 John E. Higgins, Jr., <i>The Developing Labor Law</i> 1449 n. 255 (5th ed. 2006) (collecting cases). The Supreme Court has not addressed the question of the applicability of these NLA requirements in <i>Boys Markets</i> cases. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[6]  We note but do not reach VNE's argument that the district court erred in its balance of the hardships analysis because, in its view, the Union could not be harmed by taking matters to grievance and arbitration.</p>\n<p>[7]  VNE's complaint details other clauses in the CBA that it alleges are violated by the Union's actions, but we need not delve into whether other types of clauses subject to mandatory arbitration may support a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction as those other clauses are not invoked on appeal.</p>\n<p>[8]  In a pre-<i>Wilton</i> case this court held that where the district court holds it lacks jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment because a case is not ripe, that issue is usually reviewed de novo. <i>Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp.,</i> 45 F.3d 530, 534 (1st Cir. 1995). As to the discretionary aspects of a decision to withhold declaratory judgment, we said in <i>Ernst &amp; Young</i> that we hewed a middle ground, between de novo and abuse of discretion review. <i>Id.</i> \"This standard encourages the exercise of independent appellate judgment if it appears that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Id.</i> It is unclear whether <i>Wilton</i> overruled <i>Ernst &amp; Young</i> on this point, at least in federal question cases.\n</p>\n<p>Our case law post-<i>Wilton</i> has articulated both standards of review. In a case involving a student's claim for declaratory relief under IDEA, we adhered to the <i>Ernst &amp; Young</i> formulation. <i>See </i><i>Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico,</i> 451 F.3d 13, 39 (1st Cir.2006). However, in two other cases, we stated the standard of review for denial of declaratory relief as a simple abuse of discretion standard, without discussing <i>Wilton</i>'s caveats. <i>See </i><i>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. R.I. Pub. Transit Auth.,</i> 233 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir.2000); <i>DeNovellis v. Shalala,</i> 124 F.3d 298, 313 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n\n</div>",

We affirm the denial of injunctive relief, vacate the denial of declaratory relief, and remand.</p>\n<p>Verizon New England, Inc. (VNE) alleges that the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 2322 (the Union) violated a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) no-strike clause on four occasions in 2008 and 2009. VNE argues that these acts were part of a pattern of behavior undercutting the arbitral process that warrants federal court relief. It alleges that the Union did not comply with the CBA when its members (1) made representations that the Union would fine members who brought required devices to work, (2) engaged in a short but concerted work stoppage, (3) coordinated refusals to volunteer for overtime work, and (4) protested at a VNE facility each morning for several weeks. VNE seeks injunctive relief and, in the alternative, declaratory relief in furtherance of the arbitral process.</p>\n<p>The district court granted the Union's motion for summary judgment, finding that VNE had not shown future harm and declining to issue either injunctive or declaratory relief. <i>Verizon New England, Inc. v. Local No. 2322, Int'l. Bhd. of Elec. Workers,</i> No. 09-10165-RGS, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3282605</span></span> (D.Mass. Aug. 20, 2010). Because a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction must meet the traditional standards for injunctive relief and because VNE has not, at this point, demonstrated irreparable injury, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of injunctive relief. However, because we believe the district court misapprehended the relevant legal standard for declaratory relief, we vacate the denial of that relief and remand for further consideration of the issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The CBA, effective from August 3, 2008 until August 6, 2011, contains a no-strike clause at Article G10. The clause provides,</p>\n<blockquote>The Union agrees that during the term of this Agreement, or any extension thereof, it will not cause or permit its members to cause, nor will any member of the Union take part in, any strike of or interference with any of the Company's operations or picketing of any of the Company's premises.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> Notably, the clause prohibits interference with operations and picketing of company premises in addition to strikes. It also imposes obligations on the Union with respect to both its own conduct and the conduct of its members.</p>\n<p>Under Article G8 of the CBA, the Union may submit to a grievance process any \"complaint involving the interpretation or application of any provisions of this Agreement\" and any \"complaint that an employee or group of employees for whom the Union is the bargaining agent has, in any manner, been unfairly treated.\" After the conclusion of the final step of the grievance procedure, under Article G9 the Union may demand arbitration when it believes \"the intent and meaning of one or more of the Articles of this Agreement ... has been violated by the Company,\" provided that certain procedural prerequisites have been met. The CBA allows for expedited arbitration for \"any grievance involving the suspension of an individual employee.\"</p>\n<p>The CBA does not permit VNE to invoke the grievance procedure to institute the process leading toward arbitration. Only the Union may do so, and VNE contends that the Union's failure to invoke these procedures led to this lawsuit. Rather than follow the grievance process, VNE asserts, the Union and its members have taken \"self-help\" measures in violation of the no-strike clause. In its complaint, VNE focused on what it asserts are four such prohibited self-help measures. One of these alleged violations was in response to a new company rule concerning the transport of company tools, while the remaining three alleged violations followed an altercation between a Union member and his supervisor.</p>\n<p>VNE has sought to place these instances within the context of a previous pattern of conduct it claims violated the no-strike clause. Most of these incidents involved other locals: Locals 2321, 2324, and 2222. As to incidents involving other locals, VNE asserts that since 2007 there have been two alleged incidents of picketing, a \"sit-down\" strike, a boycott of overtime, and pressures by local representatives to reduce productivity. VNE also alleges that there have been \"[p]eriodic efforts\" by \"several Locals to discourage bargaining unit employees from accepting temporary assignments to management positions going back to the mid-1980s.\" As to incidents involving Local 2322, the defendant here, VNE notes that members protested the discipline of an employee in 2001 by engaging in a \"sick out,\" which was enjoined by <i>Verizon New England, Inc. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,</i> No. 01-11636, slip op. at 1-2 (D.Mass. Nov. 17, 2001).</p>\n<p>The first of the four alleged violations at the core of this suit followed the introduction of a company rule that employees transport company-issued tool kits between job sites. An earlier rule had required only that tools be on the job site with the employee. For Equipment Installation Technicians (EI Techs), employees who are routinely assigned to work on lengthy projects at remote locations in the field, company-issued tool kits included cell phones equipped with global positioning capabilities. Some EI Techs, apparently concerned that VNE might use the phones to track their movements, refused to comply with the new rule. VNE disciplined two employees for non-compliance with the rule shortly after it was issued, and the Union grieved these disciplinary actions.</p>\n<p>In addition to filing these grievances, the Union established a set of \"EI Work Rules.\" The chief steward for EI Techs, Katherine Crowley, drafted these rules after confirming with the Union's business manager and highest official, Eugene McLaughlin, that the EI Techs could create <span class=\"star-pagination\">*181</span> such rules and after confirming with the Union's assistant business manager, Chris Jolls, that such rules could be enforced by fines. One rule stated that it was the Union's position that employees must be paid to travel or transport any company tools they choose to carry on personal time. The rule instructed EI Techs to claim overtime and travel expenses, and stated that if overtime and travel expenses were denied, \"this must be grieved.\" It continued, \"[t]his is not negotiable and is contractual.\"</p>\n<p>The EI Techs adopted the rules at a Union meeting. Shortly thereafter, on January 8, 2009, Crowley sent an email to Union members. The email stated, \"The decision has been made to enforce the union E.I. Work Rule number one in regard to the tools. The union stance is as follows, <i>do not transport any tools (except for the 3 items under protest)</i> for the manager[s].... You could be subject to answer ... for your actions and a possible fine....\" After Crowley sent this email, McLaughlin called her and told her not to send any more email messages. Crowley was not told why she should not send any additional emails, however, nor was she told to retract the email. She received no instruction as to how to enforce the EI Work Rules, and remained a chief steward.</p>\n<p>VNE alleges that only one EI Tech did not comply with the EI Work Rules, and that he was spoken to by many of the other employees. The Union, by contrast, alleges that no EI Tech ever failed to actually carry the company's tools. On this motion for summary judgment, we must take any conflict in the evidence in the light most favorable to VNE, the non-moving party. It is undisputed that no employees were disciplined by the Union for failing to comply with the EI Work Rules.</p>\n<p>The three other alleged violations at the core of this suit followed an August 25, 2009 confrontation between a splice-service technician (SST), Peter Sem, and his supervisor, Patty Regan, in a parking lot next to the VNE garage in Brockton where they worked. The facts concerning the altercation are disputed, though again we must take the facts in the light most favorable to VNE, the non-moving party. VNE alleges that Sem was drinking and that when Regan approached with a camera he assaulted her and broke the camera.<sup>[1]</sup> VNE suspended and later fired Sem as a result of the altercation. Regan also filed a criminal complaint against him; Sem was placed on probation and ordered to pay Regan $313 in restitution.</p>\n<p>The second alleged violation of Article G10 occurred a few days after the altercation, on August 28, 2009. That morning, all the employees in the garage refused to work until they had spoken to a third-level supervisor, Lance Cummings. The garage's chief steward, Bob Wall, told a first-level supervisor, Michael Shea, that the employees felt unsafe around Regan. Shea responded that Cummings would not come to the garage and that the employees needed to return to work. The employees did not return to work, and after about forty-five minutes Shea told them that if they did not return to work within five minutes they would be suspended. In the ensuing five minutes, during which only a few employees returned to work, Shea contacted the Union's new business manager, Erik Hetrick. Shea informed Hetrick that VNE was about to suspend almost all of the employees at the garage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*182</span> Hetrick requested that Shea delay any suspensions until he could get to the garage, and drove from the Union headquarters in Middleboro to the garage in Brockton. Once Hetrick arrived he spoke with the employees and reassured Shea that he believed the situation would resolve itself. He then called Cummings and requested that Regan not interact with the employees until after a representative from VNE's Employee Assistance Plan had spoken with them the following Monday. After Cummings accepted that request, the employees returned to work. VNE estimates that this work stoppage delayed the start of the work day by between an hour and an hour and a half, and argues that the stoppage violated the no-strike clause in Article G10. The Union submits that the delay was shorter, but we take the estimate of VNE, the non-moving party.</p>\n<p>VNE alleges that a third violation of Article G10 also began on August 28, 2009, when employees at the Brockton garage who had previously made themselves available to work voluntary overtime refused to work that overtime. VNE's Director of Labor Relations, Joseph Santos, informed Hetrick in a letter dated the same day that the employees declining overtime were acting \"in protest of a dispute subject to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement.\" The letter stated that the Union's obligations under Article G10 of the agreement required that it not permit such interference with VNE's operations. Santos requested that Hetrick inform him of the actions the Union was taking to restore voluntary overtime. Hetrick responded by fax stating that it was the Union's position that it had satisfied its obligations under Article G10. By September 3, 2009, every SST in the Union was refusing voluntary overtime.</p>\n<p>Finally, VNE alleges that employees at the Brockton garage violated the no-strike clause of the CBA by picketing the entrance to the garage. It is undisputed that on September 1, 2009, about twenty EI Techs began protesting in front of the Brockton garage each morning between 7:15 and 7:30. The employees walked between the two entrances of the garage and some carried signs. The Union denies that it organized these actions, but it acknowledges that Hetrick and other Union leaders participated. The Union has conceded that these protests lasted a few weeks.</p>\n<p>In its supplemental complaint, VNE argued that these actions interfered with VNE's business and that the Union failed to meet its obligations to prevent and eliminate these interferences. It argued that the alleged CBA violations caused irreparable injury to VNE by undermining the grievance and arbitration provisions of the CBA and by injuring VNE's goodwill among customers in the telecommunications field. VNE acknowledged that the damages resulting from these alleged harms were not \"readily ascertainable,\" and has not pursued the request for damages it nonetheless included in its complaint. It has focused on the two other forms of relief it requested: injunctive relief and declaratory relief. The proposed injunctive relief would enjoin the Union to take adequate steps to prevent future strike activities.</p>\n<p>The Union sought summary judgment arguing that VNE had failed to identify a violation of the no-strike clause and that in any case VNE had failed to show that any violations had caused damages or irreparable harm. It argued that (1) VNE had not found that any employee refused to carry company tools as directed by VNE, and at any rate the Union was not responsible for the actions of a rogue Union steward directing members not to follow the policy; (2) the Union acted swiftly to resolve the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*183</span> initial protest at the Brockton garage and prevented it from causing any harm to VNE; (3) VNE employees were entitled to refuse voluntary overtime because VNE may compel mandatory overtime, and the fact that VNE did not compel mandatory overtime demonstrates that it was not harmed by this refusal; and (4) the protests held outside of the Brockton garage did not constitute picketing, and at any rate did not cause VNE any harm. Further, the Union argued, VNE had available contract remedies; that is, VNE could have suspended employees, provoking the Union to start the arbitral process.</p>\n<p>Without detailing all of VNE's responses, it is quite clear that the Union was not entitled to summary judgment based on its defense that there neither was nor could have been a breach of the CBA's no-strike clause. At the very least, there were facts in dispute and the Union's attempt to disclaim any responsibility is unfounded. VNE provided evidence that the purportedly rogue Union steward acted with the Union's approval and complicity, that the sit-down strike and picketing were a classic example of wink/wink, nod/nod by Union officials, and that at least the voluntary overtime boycott affected its operations.</p>\n<p>The district court did not assess the evidence as to whether CBA violations had occurred. Instead, it assessed the level of harm to VNE and the ongoing nature of the alleged violations. The district court granted summary judgment for the Union on VNE's request for injunctive relief, finding that VNE had not alleged any ongoing breach of the CBA and had not adequately alleged either irreparable harm or a threat of a future CBA breach. <i>Verizon New England,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3282605</span></span>, at *5-7.</p>\n<p>The district court also granted summary judgment for the Union on VNE's request for declaratory relief, finding that two of the four alleged CBA violations presented no threat of recurrence, and that declarations concerning the remaining two violations would be too abstract and uncertain to warrant this form of relief. <i>Id.</i> at *7.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The Norris-La Guardia Act of 1932 (NLA) prohibited federal courts from granting injunctive relief in labor disputes. 29 U.S.C. § 104. In 1947, however, Congress enacted the LMRA, which gave federal courts jurisdiction over suits alleging violations of collective bargaining agreements. 29 U.S.C. § 185(a). In the 1950s, the use of arbitration to resolve labor disputes became a central and controlling component of federal labor policy. <i>See </i><i>Textile Workers Union v.

The Supreme Court found there was a need for some adjustment of the prohibition against enjoining strikes contained in the NLA in light of the LMRA and the use of arbitration. In <i>Boys Markets</i><sup>[2]</sup> the Court held that, despite <span class=\"star-pagination\">*184</span> the anti-injunction provisions of § 4 of the NLA, a federal court in LMRA § 301(a) cases may issue limited injunctive relief to protect the effectiveness of arbitration agreements:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he very purpose of arbitration procedures is to provide a mechanism for the expeditious settlement of industrial disputes without resort to strikes, lockouts, or other self-help measures. This basic purpose is obviously largely undercut if there is no immediate, effective remedy for those very tactics that arbitration is designed to obviate.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Boys Markets,</i> 398 U.S. at 249, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108154\"><a href=\"/opinion/108154/boys-markets-inc-v-retail-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1583</span></a></span>. The Court expressed concern that incentives for employers to agree to submit grievances to arbitration would be inappropriately dissipated<sup>[3]</sup> if employers were deprived of injunctive relief to enforce the quid pro quo of a no-strike clause.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 248, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108154\"><a href=\"/opinion/108154/boys-markets-inc-v-retail-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1583</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Boys Markets,</i> the Supreme Court established certain preconditions for the issuance of injunctive relief in labor disputes: (a) the existence of a no-strike clause, (b) clarity that the grievance in question was subject to arbitration, and (c) employer readiness to engage in such arbitration. <i>Id.</i> at 253-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108154\"><a href=\"/opinion/108154/boys-markets-inc-v-retail-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1583</span></a></span>. In addition to these preconditions, there are other limitations on the grant of a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction. The injunction must also meet all the usual criteria for injunctive relief, including irreparable injury, likelihood of success on the merits, balancing of the equities, and consideration of the public interest. <i>Id.</i> at 254, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108154\"><a href=\"/opinion/108154/boys-markets-inc-v-retail-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1583</span></a></span>. Further, the Court held that an employer \"should be ordered to arbitrate, as a condition of ... obtaining an injunction against the strike.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106432\"><a href=\"/opinion/106432/sinclair-refining-co-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 228, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106432\"><a href=\"/opinion/106432/sinclair-refining-co-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span> (1962) (Brennan, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p>Many years ago this Court held there are three conditions for injunctive relief under <i>Boys Markets:</i> \"(1) the collective bargaining agreement must contain mandatory arbitration procedures; (2) the strike to be enjoined must be over an arbitrable grievance; and (3) `ordinary principles of equity' must warrant the injunctive relief.\" <i>Nat'l Elevator Indus.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*185</span> <i>Inc. v. Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460317\"><a href=\"/opinion/460317/national-elevator-industry-inc-and-otis-elevator-company-v-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 376-77 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting <i>Int'l Detective Serv., Inc. v.

The first two of these conditions are clearly met in this case. As to the first, there is no question that the collective bargaining agreement contains mandatory arbitration procedures. As to the second, the presumption of arbitrability applies in <i>Boys Markets</i> cases, <i>see </i><i>Gateway Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108899\"><a href=\"/opinion/108899/gateway-coal-co-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 379-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108899\"><a href=\"/opinion/108899/gateway-coal-co-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span> (1974), and the disputes at issue here certainly appear to be over arbitral grievances. The third condition presents a steeper climb for VNE.</p>\n<p>Our analysis is informed by both statutory constraints and limits stemming from the rationale for the <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction. As to statutory restrictions, <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctions are limited by § 9 of the NLA, which requires that injunctions contain \"only a prohibition of such specific act or acts as may be expressly complained of in the ... complaint or petition filed\" in the case. 29 U.S.C. § 109; <i>Latas Libby's, Inc. v. United Steelworkers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"371375\"><a href=\"/opinion/371375/latas-libbys-inc-v-united-steelworkers-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">609</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1979).<sup>[5]</sup> As to limits stemming from the rationale in <i>Boys Markets,</i> the Supreme Court has held that a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction can only issue if the dispute is \"over\" issues which the striking union is obligated to arbitrate. <i>Buffalo Forge Co. v. United Steelworkers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109538\"><a href=\"/opinion/109538/buffalo-forge-co-v-steelworkers/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span>, 407, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109538\"><a href=\"/opinion/109538/buffalo-forge-co-v-steelworkers/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span> (1976). In so holding, the Court responded to risks that employers would seek court determinations on issues of arbitrability meant to be left to arbitrators.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Buffalo Forge,</i> the underlying grievance, not just the activity to be enjoined, must be governed by the arbitration requirement. If there were no requirement to arbitrate that grievance, any injunction could hardly be in aid of arbitration. <i>Id.</i> When it is clear the strike is not \"over\" such issues, no injunction may issue. In <i>Buffalo Forge,</i> the Court held that it was error to issue a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction against a sympathy strike which \"had neither the purpose nor the effect of denying or evading an obligation to arbitrate or of depriving the employer of its bargain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 407-408, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109538\"><a href=\"/opinion/109538/buffalo-forge-co-v-steelworkers/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2672</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>This court has read <i>Boys Markets</i> such that frustration of the arbitral process does not necessarily establish irreparable injury for purposes of injunctive relief. In <i>Latas Libby's,</i> we affirmed a district court's finding that a union had violated a no-strike clause and affirmed the district court's award of damages for the illegal strike. <i>Latas Libby's,</i> 609 F.2d at 28-30. We vacated, however, prospective injunctive relief as to future strikes. The injunction had required the union to comply in all future actions with the no-strike clause of the CBA. <i>Id.</i> at 30. This court held that given that the record disclosed no prior violations of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*186</span> the no-strike agreement, the prospective injunctive relief went further than needed. <i>Id.</i> at 30-32. We commented, \"[a]lthough we do not say that repeated violations of a no-strike covenant never warrant broad prospective relief, in the absence of any showing here of a continuing course of conduct evidencing the unwillingness of the Union to abide by the no-strike provision,\" the district court's injunction was too broad to stand. <i>Id.</i> We also noted that the broad relief granted would violate § 9 of the NLA. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n<p>This court has also reaffirmed the requirement that injunctive relief may only be granted under <i>Boys Markets</i> in furtherance of the arbitral process. In <i>Tejidos de Coamo, Inc. v. International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668250\"><a href=\"/opinion/668250/tejidos-de-coamo-inc-etc-v-international-ladies-garment-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1994), we held that an order on behalf of an employer staying arbitration, <i>id.</i> at 11, was an immediately appealable injunction and that the injunction was not validly issued under <i>Boys Markets, see id.</i> at 12-13. There, injunctive relief could not be justified \"on either ground  to enforce a contract or support arbitration  let alone both.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12. That an order staying arbitration could not be in support of arbitration was self-evident. <i>Id.</i> The company argued that there was no contract requiring arbitration and that it could not be forced into arbitration. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In addition to vacating overly broad injunctive relief and injunctive relief that did not advance the arbitral process, this court has also reversed grants of <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctive relief for failure to meet the traditional four-part equitable test. <i>See </i><i>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v.

There is no reason why the district court could not jump, as it did, to the irreparable injury issue, and so we turn to that. We review denials of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion, reviewing underlying legal questions de novo. <i>Animal Welfare Inst. v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"177519\"><a href=\"/opinion/177519/animal-welfare-institute-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">623</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>VNE argues that the district court made several errors in its denial of injunctive relief. Primarily, it argues the court misapprehended the nature of the harm at issue by measuring the direct harm caused by each alleged CBA violation.<sup>[6]</sup> VNE argues that the court should have taken the four alleged violations as a whole and assessed \"the harm to the arbitral process caused by the Union's repeated resort to picketing and strikes over matters the Union seems to agree are subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the CBA.\"</p>\n<p>In the more common case in which <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctions have been issued, the strike is occurring at the time of suit or is imminent. <i>See</i> 1 John E. Higgins, Jr., <i>The Developing Labor Law</i> 1461 (5th ed. 2006). <i>Boys Markets</i> itself concerned an ongoing violation of a no-strike clause. <i>Boys Markets,</i> 398 U.S. at 239-40, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108154\"><a href=\"/opinion/108154/boys-markets-inc-v-retail-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In theory, questions may arise as to the application of <i>Boys Markets</i> to job actions short <span class=\"star-pagination\">*187</span> of actual strikes. But we have held that activities short of an actual strike may also violate no-strike clauses, including work slowdowns and concerted refusals to work overtime.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Nat'l Elevator Indus.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460317\"><a href=\"/opinion/460317/national-elevator-industry-inc-and-otis-elevator-company-v-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>; <i>see also </i><i>Avco Corp. v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2672</span></a></span> (suit by employer under LMRA § 301 is not mooted by cessation of work stoppage). But that fact does go to the issue of irreparable harm. Patterns of repeated past strikes in violation of no-strike clauses may support issuance of prospective injunctive relief even when there is no ongoing strike. As the district court recognized, however, in this case the four alleged job actions were not full-blown strikes, nor do the alleged actions establish a repeated pattern giving rise to ongoing harm. VNE's assertion that the four alleged breaches threaten \"death by pin pricks,\" <i>Verizon New England,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3282605</span></span>, at *7 n. 7, is insufficient. The district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the threshold of irreparable injury had not been met.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court has indicated that appellate review of discretionary decisions not to grant declaratory relief is generally for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Wilton v.

The need for ripeness is emphasized in the Declaratory Judgment Act (DJA), 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), which refers to an \"actual\" controversy.

The \"fitness\" inquiry concerns questions of finality, definiteness, and the need for further factual development. <i>Id.</i> Under \"hardship,\" the court should consider whether the challenged action \"creates a `direct and immediate' dilemma\" for the parties. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>W.R.

As we have reaffirmed since our decision in <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> these inquiries are highly fact-dependent, such that the \"various integers that enter into the ripeness equation play out quite differently from case to case.\" <i>Doe v. Bush,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781274\"><a href=\"/opinion/781274/john-doe-i-john-doe-ii-john-doe-iii-john-doe-iv-jane-doe-i-susan-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 138 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 45 F.3d at 535).</p>\n<p>Before the district court, the Union argued that declaratory relief should not be granted because VNE's allegations were not of \"sufficient immediacy or controversy\" to warrant the exercise of the court's discretion. It argued that the controversy was no longer ongoing, and that VNE had not shown that the arbitral process had failed to function properly. In <i>State of R.I. v. Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195256\"><a href=\"/opinion/195256/state-of-ri-v-narragansett-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994), we rejected such a confined approach to considering the question of \"hardship.\" In that case, we firmly held that \"this part of the [ripeness] inquiry should focus on the judgment's usefulness.\" <i>Id.</i> at 693. We held that \"[r]ather than asking, negatively, whether denying relief would impose hardship, courts will do well to ask, in a more positive vein, whether granting relief would serve a useful purpose, or, put another way, whether the sought-after declaration would be of practical assistance in setting the underlying controversy to rest.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The district court identified this governing standard, but its analysis did not comport with the standard's requirements. The court concluded that the first two of the four claimed CBA violations could not meet the ripeness requirement because \"they pertain to discrete past incidents that present no threat of recurrence.\" <i>Verizon New England,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3282605</span></span>, at *7. It allowed that there could be possible future harm to VNE from renewed boycotts of voluntary overtime or wildcat picketing, but held it would be inappropriate to comment on future <span class=\"star-pagination\">*189</span> events. <i>Id.</i> As to the overtime boycotts, the court stated that it \"would be uncomfortable ordering employees to do what [VNE] itself characterizes as a voluntary act,\" and that VNE had not shown that the overtime boycotts posed a \"substantial hardship.\" <i>Id.</i> As to the alleged picketing, it held that any effort \"to define in the abstract when picketing is or is not lawful (or appropriate) is a hopeless task given the myriad forms that speech can take in the context of a labor dispute.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This articulation mischaracterizes VNE's request for declaratory relief, which went to the four alleged CBA violations and sought a declaration as to their legal effects. VNE did not request that the court define in the abstract when picketing is lawful, nor did it request that the court issue a declaratory order requiring employees to volunteer for overtime. Nor did VNE rest its request for declaratory relief on the premise that work stoppages and Union communications about company tools would continue to occur in the future as they had in the past. Rather, VNE requested a declaration as to the lawfulness of the particular acts described in its complaint under the no-strike clause of the CBA.</p>\n<p>The dispute about the legal effect of these four alleged violations is clearly ripe, as Article III requires. The actions have happened; it is the legal effects of these actions under the no-strike clause and LMRA § 301 that are at issue. \"There is little difficulty in finding an actual controversy if all of the acts that are alleged to create liability have already occurred. The court is then merely being asked, as in any litigation, to determine the legal consequences of past events....\" 10B Charles Alan Wright et al., <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 2757, at 475 (1998). VNE seeks a declaration that the Union's past actions contravened the no-strike clause of the CBA and frustrated the company's bargained-for quid pro quo that such matters be resolved through arbitration. This is not a situation where a declaration is sought on the legal consequences of a hypothetical act that may or may not occur in the future. <i>Id.</i> at 475-476.</p>\n<p>Nor does a decision that the harm to VNE does not warrant preliminary injunctive relief preclude an examination of whether VNE should nonetheless be granted a declaratory judgment. <i>See </i><i>Powell v.

The DJA itself states that declaratory judgment may be granted \"whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). The Act embodies the view that declaratory relief is alternative or cumulative, and not extraordinary relief. 10B Wright et al., <i>supra</i> § 2758, at 508.</p>\n<p>Further, this court has recognized the utility of declaratory judgments in cases brought under § 301 of the LMRA in which injunctive relief is denied. In <i>Tejidos de Coamo,</i> this court remanded for consideration of a request for declaratory relief in a § 301 LMRA action where we had reversed the grant of injunctive relief:</p>\n<blockquote>Although section 301 actions are ordinarily brought to enforce contracts, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, permits the declaration of rights about which a real controversy exists, and the Unions have not disputed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*190</span> the district court's authority to grant declaratory relief.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Tejidos de Coamo,</i> 22 F.3d at 15. Importantly, <i>Tejidos</i> also emphasized that the constraints on injunctions in <i>Boys Markets</i> type cases do not apply to the relief of declaratory judgment. As we said, \"Nor does section 7 [of the NLA, 29 U.S.C. § 107] pose any barrier to such a declaration; it is directed only against injunctions.\" <i>Id.</i> The NLA provides no protection against actions for declaratory relief. <i>Wilkes-Barre Pub.

Whether there has been a pattern of evasion of arbitration through violations of a no-strike provision is highly relevant to whether future injunctive relief should be granted if the pattern recurs. <i>See </i><i>Latas Libby's,</i> 609 F.2d at 31-32; <i>see also </i><i>Powell,</i> 395 U.S. at 499, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107969\"><a href=\"/opinion/107969/powell-v-mccormack/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That is all that <i>Boys Markets,</i> with its statement that \"both parties are contractually bound\" to arbitrate, 398 U.S. at 254, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108154\"><a href=\"/opinion/108154/boys-markets-inc-v-retail-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1583</span></a></span>, requires. <i>See also </i><i>Avco Corp. v. Local Union #787,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"303289\"><a href=\"/opinion/303289/avco-corporation-v-local-union-787-of-the-international-union-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">968</span></a></span>, 972 (3d Cir.1972). Indeed, one-way grievance ratchets may increase the likelihood of employers seeking <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctions. In any event, the Union has not asserted that the normal rules for <i>Boys Markets</i> cases are somehow altered by the fact that the CBA in this case contains such a one-way ratchet.</p>\n<p>[4]  Some courts have recognized what is called \"the reverse <i>Boys Markets</i> exception.\" <i>Aeronautical Indus. Dist. Lodge 91 v. United Techs. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770886\"><a href=\"/opinion/770886/aeronautical-industrial-district-lodge-91-of-the-international-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span> (2d Cir.2000). This exception \"permits unions to obtain injunctions against employers to preserve the status quo pending arbitration of a labor dispute as long as: (1) the underlying dispute is subject to mandatory arbitration; and (2) an injunction is necessary to prevent the arbitration process from becoming a `hollow formality' or `meaningless ritual.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 581 (quoting <i>Niagara Hooker Emps. Union v. Occidental Chem. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563200\"><a href=\"/opinion/563200/niagara-hooker-employees-union-v-occidental-chemical-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1370</span></a></span>, 1377 (2d Cir.1991)); <i>see also </i><i>Lever Bros. Co. v. Int'l Chem. Workers Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"344989\"><a href=\"/opinion/344989/lever-brothers-company-v-international-chemical-workers-union-local-217/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 123 (4th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p>[5]  While this circuit apparently has not reached the question, <i>see </i><i>Otis Elevator Co. v. Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors, Local 4,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201576\"><a href=\"/opinion/201576/otis-elevator-co-v-local-4/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 n. 5 (1st Cir.2005), most courts have concluded that the requirements of § 7 of the NLA also apply to <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctions. That section, 29 U.S.C. § 107, specifies certain procedural and evidentiary requirements. <i>See</i> 1 John E. Higgins, Jr., <i>The Developing Labor Law</i> 1449 n. 255 (5th ed. 2006) (collecting cases). The Supreme Court has not addressed the question of the applicability of these NLA requirements in <i>Boys Markets</i> cases. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[6]  We note but do not reach VNE's argument that the district court erred in its balance of the hardships analysis because, in its view, the Union could not be harmed by taking matters to grievance and arbitration.</p>\n<p>[7]  VNE's complaint details other clauses in the CBA that it alleges are violated by the Union's actions, but we need not delve into whether other types of clauses subject to mandatory arbitration may support a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction as those other clauses are not invoked on appeal.</p>\n<p>[8]  In a pre-<i>Wilton</i> case this court held that where the district court holds it lacks jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment because a case is not ripe, that issue is usually reviewed de novo. <i>Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195859\"><a href=\"/opinion/195859/ernst-young-v-depositors-economic/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span>, 534 (1st Cir. 1995). As to the discretionary aspects of a decision to withhold declaratory judgment, we said in <i>Ernst &amp; Young</i> that we hewed a middle ground, between de novo and abuse of discretion review. <i>Id.</i> \"This standard encourages the exercise of independent appellate judgment if it appears that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Id.</i> It is unclear whether <i>Wilton</i> overruled <i>Ernst &amp; Young</i> on this point, at least in federal question cases.\n</p>\n<p>Our case law post-<i>Wilton</i> has articulated both standards of review. In a case involving a student's claim for declaratory relief under IDEA, we adhered to the <i>Ernst &amp; Young</i> formulation. <i>See </i><i>Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202265\"><a href=\"/opinion/202265/diaz-fonseca-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2006). However, in two other cases, we stated the standard of review for denial of declaratory relief as a simple abuse of discretion standard, without discussing <i>Wilton</i>'s caveats. <i>See </i><i>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. R.I. Pub. Transit Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199171\"><a href=\"/opinion/199171/hartford-fire-v-ri-public-transit/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.2000); <i>DeNovellis v. Shalala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746214\"><a href=\"/opinion/746214/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1520-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45029-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 313 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n\n</div>",
