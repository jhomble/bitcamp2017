We\n\naffirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          We  succinctly summarize  the facts necessary  to place\n\nthis appeal into proper perspective, recounting disputed facts in\n\na  manner  consistent  with   the  district  court's  supportable\n\nfindings of fact.\n\n          On  November 5,  1987,  a  federal  grand jury  in  the\n\nDistrict of Columbia indicted defendant-appellant Edward L. Gallo\n\non  a medley of firearms charges.1  Initially, the district court\n\nfound  appellant  incompetent  to  stand trial  and  ordered  him\n\ncivilly committed.  He was  diagnosed as suffering from  paranoid\n\nschizophrenia,   thought   to   be  incurable   but,   hopefully,\n\ncontrollable through  medication.   Thereafter, in July  of 1989,\n\nappellant pleaded  guilty  to a  single  count of  possessing  an\n\nunregistered  firearm in violation of  26 U.S.C.    5861(j).  The\n\ndistrict court then  dismissed the remaining  five counts of  the\n\nindictment; sentenced appellant  to three years  of imprisonment,\n\nsuspended;  placed him on probation for five years; and crafted a\n\nspecial  set of  conditions ancillary  to the  probationary term.\n\n                    \n\n     1Police officers,  who were  investigating a threat  to harm\nformer Secretary of State George Schultz, intercepted Gallo as he\nemerged  from  a  Washington motel  on  November  3,  1987.   The\nofficers   found  a  small  arsenal  in   the  trunk  of  Gallo's\nautomobile,  including  a rifle,  a  sawed-off  shotgun, a  semi-\nautomatic shotgun, and various types of ammunition.\n\n                                2\n\nThe first and second conditions possess particular pertinence for\n\npresent purposes.  They read in relevant part:\n\n          1.   The defendant  shall be confined  to St.\n          Elizabeth's  Hospital for  a period  of sixty\n          days.\n\n          2.   Defendant  shall  continue to  submit to\n          proper  psychiatric  treatment, inclusive  of\n          medication, upon his  release from  impatient\n          [sic]  hospitalization  and shall  consent to\n          the  Probation  Office having  access  to his\n          medical records. . . .\n\nIn fact, appellant stayed at St. Elizabeth's for much longer than\n\nsixty  days following the imposition of sentence.  In the fall of\n\n1990, the hospital discharged him.  In the same time frame, three\n\nother interrelated events occurred:   appellant took up residence\n\nat  his  mother's home  in  Massachusetts;  the sentencing  court\n\ntransferred jurisdiction over  the matter to its  sister court in\n\nthe District of Massachusetts; and probation supervision began in\n\nthat district.\n\n          While at  St.  Elizabeth's,  appellant  first  met  Dr.\n\nGeller,  a Massachusetts-based  psychiatrist.    After  appellant\n\nsojourned  to  Massachusetts,  he consulted  regularly  with  Dr.\n\nGeller.2   His  course  of treatment  centered  around a  monthly\n\ninjection  of  haloperidol  decanoate  (Haldol).   The  treatment\n\nprotocol featured gradual decreases in dosage, aimed at lessening\n\nthe  patient's   dependence  upon  the  drug.     Appellant,  who\n\nsteadfastly maintained  that he  had no psychiatric  disorder and\n\nthat he should  not be on medication at all,  favored the dosage-\n\n                    \n\n     2Throughout  the course  of  treatment Dr.  Geller submitted\nperiodic reports to the probation office.\n\n                                3\n\nreduction program.\n\n          Over  a  period of  more  than  two years,  Dr.  Geller\n\ndecreased  Gallo's dosage  from  150 milligrams  per month  to 25\n\nmilligrams  per month.  In  January of 1993,  however, the doctor\n\nnoted ominous  behavioral changes.  For  example, appellant began\n\nwriting of his belief  that satellites and lasers were  attacking\n\nhim  and threatening  national  security; in  addition, he  began\n\nacting  in a manner reminiscent of how he had behaved immediately\n\nprior  to his  arrest in  1987.   When the  dosage dropped  to 20\n\nmilligrams per month, Dr.  Geller became concerned that appellant\n\nwas  no  longer  responding  appropriately  to   the  medication.\n\nNonetheless, appellant  expressed staunch opposition  to resuming\n\nheavier doses of Haldol.\n\n          The  dosage-reduction program  continued until  May 21,\n\n1993,  when  Dr. Geller,  due in  part  to Gallo's  opposition to\n\nincreasing the dosage and  in part to the reported  recurrence of\n\nhallucinogenic experiences, advised  the probation office of  his\n\nopinion   that  \"proper   psychiatric  treatment\"   demanded  \"an\n\ninpatient  psychiatric admission\"  because  Gallo could  not  \"be\n\neffectively  or  safely managed  on  an  outpatient basis.\"3    A\n\nprobation officer  immediately visited appellant and informed him\n\nof Dr. Geller's  recommendation.  Appellant debunked the need for\n\ninpatient  treatment and  refused  to cooperate.   The  probation\n\n                    \n\n     3The straw that broke the dromedary's  back may have emerged\non May 20,  when Gallo for the first time  voiced an inability to\nassure Dr.  Geller that he  would not do  something he or  others\nwould regret.\n\n                                4\n\nofficer concluded that \"given Mr. Gallo's current mental state, .\n\n. . he presents a  potential risk to himself and/or others.\"   On\n\nthe following day, the officer requested that the  district court\n\nissue  a warrant  for violation  of the  conditions  attendant to\n\nprobation.\n\n          After  an  evidentiary  hearing,  the  district  court,\n\nciting,  inter  alia,  the  risk  to public  safety,  found  that\n                    \n\nappellant  needed inpatient care to determine the proper level of\n\nmedication  and get  his treatment  program back  on track.   The\n\ncourt  then ruled  that  appellant had  violated the  outstanding\n\nprobation order by refusing to  undergo hospitalization.  On this\n\nbasis, the  court revoked Gallo's  probation, sentenced him  to a\n\none-year term of  immurement, see 18  U.S.C.   3565(a)(2)  (1988)\n                                 \n\n(stipulating that,  upon finding  a probation violation,  a court\n\nmay  \"revoke  the  sentence of  probation  and  impose  any other\n\nsentence  that was  available . .  . at  the time  of the initial\n\nsentencing\"), and recommended  that appellant serve the  sentence\n\nin  \"a  facility that  can  provide  the appropriate  psychiatric\n\ntreatment and .  . . hospitalization.\"  The court  also imposed a\n\nfollow-on term  of supervised  release,  attaching seven  special\n\nconditions  to  that  term   (including  a  condition   requiring\n\ncontinued psychiatric care).\n\n          Gallo appeals.  Although he parades several assignments\n\nof error before us, they march beneath two broad banners.  First,\n\nappellant  challenges the probation  order, asseverating  that it\n\nneither required  involuntary  hospitalization nor  afforded  him\n\n                                5\n\nadequate  notice that, by refusing such care, he would be risking\n\nimprisonment.   Second,  he  challenges  the revocation  decision\n\nitself, including the finding that a violation occurred.4\n\nII.  THE PROBATION ORDER\n\n          The Due Process Clause extends to probation  revocation\n\nproceedings.   See Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973).\n                                      \n\nFair  warning  of conduct  that may  result  in revocation  is an\n\nintegral  part of  due process  in such  situations.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Simmons,  812 F.2d 561,  565 (9th  Cir. 1987).   Here,\n                  \n\nappellant  argues that  the conditions of  his probation  did not\n\nrequire  him to acquiesce  in hospitalization, or, alternatively,\n\ndid not provide  fair warning that failure to  do so might result\n\nin revocation.  We approach these arguments with full realization\n\nthat the interpretation of a  probation condition and whether  it\n\naffords  a probationer  fair  warning of  the conduct  proscribed\n\nthereby are essentially matters of law  and, therefore, give rise\n\nto de novo review  on appeal.  See  In re Howard, 996  F.2d 1320,\n                                                \n\n1327 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining that \"unadulterated questions of\n\nlaw\"  customarily entail  plenary review);  cf. Firestone  Tire &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nRubber  Co. v.  Bruch,  489 U.S.  101,  115 (1989)  (establishing\n                     \n\n                    \n\n     4Initially, appellant also claimed  that the district court,\nin  sentencing  him to  a period  longer  than that  suggested in\nU.S.S.G.   7B1.4, failed  adequately to  consider the  Sentencing\nCommission's policy  statement.   Since appellant has  now served\nthe one-year sentence in  full, he has withdrawn this claim.  But\nbecause he is still serving the supervised release term, the same\ncircumstance does not  render the remainder  of his appeal  moot.\nSee, e.g., Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 237 (1968) (holding\n                              \nthat,  although  a sentence  has  been  served,  the presence  of\n\"collateral consequences\" can save a case from mootness).\n\n                                6\n\nstandard of de novo judicial review for construction of  employee\n                   \n\nbenefit plans).\n\n                   A.  Scope of the Conditions.\n                                              \n\n          The threshold question  is whether inpatient  treatment\n\nfalls within the  scope of the probation order.   We believe that\n\nthe conditions of probation definitely encompass such treatment.\n\n          The   probation  order   states  that   appellant  must\n\n\"continue to submit to proper psychiatric treatment, inclusive of\n\nmedication, . . . .\"   We are confident that this broadly phrased\n\ndirective, read naturally and with due regard for context, covers\n\ninpatient  care.   After all,  the sentencing  judge attached  no\n\nqualifiers  or   words  of  limitation  to   the  requirement  of\n\ntreatment,  other  than  that   the  treatment  be  \"proper\"  and\n\n\"psychiatric.\"   And in terms of language, we deem it significant\n\nthat the  condition directs that appellant \"continue to submit to\n                                                    \n\nproper  psychiatric treatment. . . .\"  (Emphasis supplied.)  When\n\nthis   verb  usage  is  examined  against  the  backdrop  of  the\n\nimmediately   preceding   condition,   which  memorializes   that\n\nappellant \"shall be confined to St. Elizabeth's Hospital\" for his\n\ninitial  treatment,5 continuation of that treatment cannot fairly\n\nbe read  to exclude further  hospitalization.  And,  moreover, an\n\nexpansive  reading  is  especially  compelling in  light  of  the\n\nincurable nature  of appellant's illness and  his previous three-\n\nyear stay in a psychiatric hospital.\n\n                    \n\n     5By like token, Condition No. 2 itself states that it  is to\ntake  effect   \"upon  [Gallo's]  release   from  impatient  [sic]\nhospitalization. . . .\"\n\n                                7\n\n          We think,  too, that the circumstances  surrounding the\n\nprobation  order necessitate  such an  interpretation.   The plea\n\nagreement  commemorated appellant's  understanding that  he would\n\nhave to report on  a regular basis to a  \"mental health physician\n\nchosen by  the government\" and \"follow  the doctor's instructions\n\nunless  excused by  an  order of  the  Court.\"   Thus,  the  plea\n\nagreement made pellucid that appropriate medical  care lay at the\n\nheart of  the  agreed  disposition  of  appellant's  case     and\n\nhospitalization  is  a  mainstay  of  appropriate  medical  care.\n\nMoreover,  the probationary  period was to  last for  five years;\n\nduring  so lengthy  a  span, it  was  certainly foreseeable  that\n\nappellant's  medical needs  might  evolve in  such  a way  as  to\n\nrequire rehospitalization.   Put bluntly, inpatient  care, having\n\nproved necessary in  the past,  was well within  the universe  of\n\ntreatment modalities that might prove \"proper\" in the future.\n\n          Under  the circumstances  of  this case,  it is  beyond\n\nserious question that  the words  \"proper psychiatric  treatment\"\n\nwere intended to include    and did include   the  possibility of\n\nhospitalization.  Consequently,  we reject appellant's  complaint\n\nthat the  conditions attached  to his  probation did  not require\n\nsubmission to inpatient medical care.\n\n                 B.  Sufficiency of the Warning.\n                                               \n\n          Appellant  has  a fallback  position.    He strives  to\n\npersuade us  that, even  if the  written  conditions extended  to\n\nenforced hospitalization, they did not afford him adequate notice\n\nthat  refusal  to  accept   such  treatment  would  constitute  a\n\n                                8\n\nviolation  of his  probation.  In  studying this  proposition, we\n\nmust ask whether  appellant was chargeable with  knowledge of the\n\nprobation order's inclusive requirements (and  the penalties that\n\nmight  be imposed  for disregarding  those requirements)  when he\n\nspurned the request to admit himself to the hospital.\n\n          When,  as  now,  a court  order  is  read  to proscribe\n\nconduct  that  is not  in itself  unlawful,  the dictates  of due\n\nprocess  forbid the forfeiture of an actor's liberty by reason of\n\nsuch conduct unless he is given fair warning.  See  United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Grant,  816 F.2d  440, 442 (9th  Cir. 1987); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nDane, 570 F.2d 840,  843 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied,  436 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n959 (1978); see also  Marks v. United  States, 430 U.S. 188,  191\n                                             \n\n(1977) (discussing  fair warning  in respect  to conduct that  is\n\ndeemed  criminal); Bouie v. City  of Columbia, 378  U.S. 347, 351\n                                             \n\n(1964) (similar).   Nevertheless, the fair  warning doctrine does\n\nnot provide a safe  harbor for probationers who choose  to ignore\n\nthe obvious.\n\n          Furthermore, though a probationer is entitled to notice\n\nof what behavior will result in a violation, so that he may guide\n\nhis  actions accordingly, fair warning is not to be confused with\n\nthe   fullest,   or   most  pertinacious,   warning   imaginable.\n\nConditions of probation  do not have  to be  cast in letters  six\n\nfeet high, or to describe every possible permutation, or to spell\n\nout  every last, self-evident detail.   See Green  v. Abrams, 984\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 41, 46-47 (2d  Cir. 1993) (holding that, though  a probation\n\norder  did not specify  the time for  payment of a  fine, it gave\n\n                                9\n\nsufficient  notice  that failure  to pay  the  fine would  work a\n\nviolation); see also United States v. Ferryman, 897 F.2d 584, 590\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir.)  (noting in an  analogous context that  defendants are\n\nentitled  only to  \"fair notice,\"  not \"letter  perfect notice\"),\n\ncert. denied, 498 U.S.  830 (1990).  Conditions of  probation may\n            \n\nafford fair warning even if they  are not precise to the point of\n\npedantry.  In short, conditions of probation can be written   and\n\nmust be read   in a commonsense way.\n\n          Adherence to  these principles  demands that  we uphold\n\nthe adequacy of the warning furnished  here.  We have three  main\n\nreasons for reaching this conclusion.  First, we cannot fault the\n\ndistrict  court's finding  that  the phrase  \"proper  psychiatric\n\ntreatment, inclusive of  medication,\" on the  basis of its  plain\n\nmeaning, see supra  Part II(A),  put appellant on  notice that  a\n                  \n\nrefusal   to  follow   doctor's   instructions   and  submit   to\n\nhospitalization  would constitute  a violation  of the  probation\n\norder.6   Cf., e.g., Mace  v. Amestoy, 765  F. Supp.  847, 849-50\n                                     \n\n(D. Vt.  1991) (ruling  that a  condition of  probation requiring\n\nparticipation in and completion of a \"sexual therapy program\" put\n\ndefendant on notice that  therapy might necessitate admitting his\n\nsexual misconduct).   The challenged condition,  read in context,\n\n                    \n\n     6Appellant  contends that,  under Simmons,  812 F.2d  561, a\n                                              \nprobationer is routinely entitled to receive more specific notice\nof  proscribed behavior  than that delivered  by means  of formal\nconditions of probation.   We disagree.  A careful reading of the\npassage cited by appellant indicates that our view coincides with\nthat of the Simmons court.   When the proscribed behavior is  not\n                   \nitself  criminal  in  nature,  formal  conditions  of  probation,\nplainly  written,  are  generally  thought  to  supply sufficient\nactual notice of proscribed activities.  See id. at 565.\n                                                \n\n                                10\n\nitself provided fair warning.\n\n          Second,  there  is nothing  in  the  record to  suggest\n\neither that  appellant acted under  a misapprehension or  that he\n\nbelieved a  refusal to  accept inpatient admission  would comport\n\nwith the conditions of his probation.  A probationer who does not\n\nadvance a  credible claim that  he was unaware,  or misunderstood\n\nthe scope,  of the conditions of his probation is hard pressed to\n\nclaim that he  lacked fair warning.  See, e.g.,  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nLaughlin, 933 F.2d 786, 790 (9th Cir. 1991).  So it is here.\n        \n\n          Finally,  the  inquiry   into  fair   warning  is   not\n\nnecessarily confined to the four  corners of the probation order.\n\nSee  Grant, 816 F.2d  at 442; United  States v. Romero,  676 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n406,  407 (9th Cir. 1982).  The  meaning of a probation order may\n\nbe illuminated by the judge's statements, the probation officer's\n\ninstructions,  or other events, any or all of which may assist in\n\ncompleting the notification  process and in  aiding the court  to\n\ndetermine whether  a probationer  has been forewarned  about what\n\nconduct could be deemed to transgress the probation order.\n\n          Here,  several pieces  of  data buttress  the  district\n\ncourt's finding  that appellant  received fair  warning.   In the\n\nfirst place,  the plea agreement  provided a prism  through which\n\nthe  conditions of probation could  be read    and that agreement\n\nmade the  scope of the conditions very clear.  See supra pp. 7-8.\n                                                        \n\nIn the second place,  appellant signed his name below the list of\n\nconditions  contemporaneous with the  imposition of  the original\n\nsentence.   In this fashion, he signified his understanding that,\n\n                                11\n\nupon a finding of a violation, probation might be revoked.   Such\n\na manifestation of acceptance of the terms, though rebuttable, is\n\nprima facie evidence of a probationer's knowing acceptance of the\n           \n\nconditions  in place at the time probation commenced.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nGreen, 984  F.2d at 47; United States v. Barth, 899 F.2d 199, 203\n                                              \n\n(2d Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1083 (1991).\n                            \n\n          It is also significant  that both the probation officer\n\nand the court repeatedly  explained to appellant the risk  he was\n\nrunning.   The record  reflects that  the probation  officer told\n\nappellant on May 21 that Dr. Geller believed inpatient  treatment\n\nwas essential to meet the  goal of \"proper psychiatric treatment\"\n\nand exhorted appellant  to comply.   Such a  conversation may  be\n\nconsidered  as a  component of  the notification  process.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Green, 984 F.2d at  47; Romero, 676 F.2d at 407;  Mace, 765\n                                                            \n\nF.  Supp. at  849-50.    Furthermore,  the  district  judge,  who\n\nexhibited  great  sensitivity in  his  thoughtful  handling of  a\n\ndifficult  case, urged  appellant on  more  than one  occasion to\n\nrelent   and  told  him  in  no  uncertain  terms  that,  if  his\n\nintransigence  did not abate, he  would be found  in violation of\n\nthe probation order.\n\n          To  sum  up,  appellant timely  received  the probation\n\norder;  the conditions  of  probation  contained therein  clearly\n\ncontemplated  inpatient  care  if medically  indicated;  and  the\n\npenalties that  might flow  from violating those  conditions were\n\napparent.  Given the unvarnished terms  of the special condition,\n\nappellant's previous  three-year hospital stay, the  tenor of the\n\n                                12\n\nplea  agreement,  the  probation   officer's  guidance,  and  the\n\ndistrict judge's  entreaties, appellant received ample  notice of\n\nboth the proscription  against refusing  inpatient treatment  and\n\nthe possible, if  not certain, consequence  of persisting in  his\n\nchosen course of conduct.\n\nIII.  THE REVOCATION DECISION\n\n          The   standard  of   appellate  review   pertaining  to\n\nrevocation decisions is  not in  doubt.  When  a district  court,\n\nafter holding an evidentiary hearing, finds a probation violation\n\nand determines that revocation is a condign response, we will not\n\nprepare a  palimpsest, but  will scrutinize the  district court's\n\ndecision  only  for abuse  of discretion.    See Burns  v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 287 U.S.  216, 222  (1932); United States  v. Nolan,  932\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 1005, 1006 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Morin, 889 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n328, 331 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          To reach the point at which  revocation of probation is\n\nappropriate, a  district court  must complete a  two-step pavane.\n\nThe first component is historical; it involves the \"retrospective\n\nfactual question whether the probationer has violated a condition\n\nof probation.\"  Black v.  Romano, 471 U.S. 606, 611 (1985).   The\n                                \n\nsecond  component  is  judgmental; it  involves  \"a discretionary\n\ndetermination by the sentencing  authority whether violation of a\n\ncondition  warrants revocation of probation.\"  Id.  We proceed to\n                                                  \n\nreview the district court's  determinations as to each component,\n\nmindful, withal, that  \"[t]he Due  Process Clause .  . .  imposes\n\nprocedural  and  substantive  limits  on the  revocation  of  the\n\n                                13\n\nconditional liberty created by probation.\"  Id. at 610.\n                                               \n\n                        A.  The Violation.\n                                         \n\n          At a revocation  proceeding, the  prosecution need  not\n\nprove the conduct charged beyond a reasonable doubt; it is enough\n\nif the  proof,  reasonably viewed,  satisfies  the court  that  a\n\nviolation occurred.  See  United States v. Gordon, 961  F.2d 426,\n                                                 \n\n429 (3d Cir. 1992); United States v. Czajak, 909 F.2d 20, 22 (1st\n                                           \n\nCir. 1990); United States v. Lacey, 661 F.2d 1021, 1022 (5th Cir.\n                                  \n\n1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 961 (1982).\n                   \n\n          The  government met  this burden  in the  instant case.\n\nDespite being fully apprised of  Dr. Geller's views and receiving\n\nan  urgent request from the probation  officer, appellant did not\n\nagree to institutionalize himself.   Even after the judge  drew a\n\nline  in the sand,  appellant remained adamant  in his insistence\n\nthat  he would  not  submit to  inpatient  care.   On  this stark\n\nrecord,  the district  court's  explicit  finding that  appellant\n\nknowingly and  wilfully  elected to  ignore  a condition  of  his\n\nprobation is  entirely supportable.   It  follows that  the first\n\nstep in the two-step pavane is easily ventured.7\n\n                       B.  The Disposition.\n                                          \n\n          When revocation of probation  is committed to  judicial\n\n                    \n\n     7Appellant  argues  that  there  was  no  medical  need  for\n                                                      \nhospitalization,  but  merely  an administrative  need,  i.e.,  a\n                                                             \ndesire to husband  the costs of  supervision.  Assuming,  without\ndeciding, that  this is a meaningful  distinction, we nonetheless\nreject the  argument.  Dr.  Geller's testimony at  the revocation\nhearing, fully credited by the district court, made it clear that\nhe treated appellant as he would have treated any other similarly\nafflicted  patient, and  that  hospitalization was  needed as  an\nintegral part of \"proper psychiatric treatment.\"\n\n                                14\n\ndiscretion,  judges should not regard it as a routine response to\n\nevery probation violation.  Rather, revocation should be reserved\n\nfor those instances in  which the case history, coupled  with the\n\nprobationer's behavior, indicates  that it is  a fair, just,  and\n\nsensible outcome.   See, e.g.,  Nolan, 932 F.2d  at 1006;  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Fryar, 920 F.2d 252, 257 (5th Cir. 1990), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n499  U.S. 981  (1991); see also  Steven A. Childress  &amp; Martha S.\n                               \n\nDavis, Federal Standards  of Review,    11.39 at  11-161 (2d  ed.\n                                   \n\n1986).  This second step  of the revocation analysis necessitates\n\nindividualized attention to the particular probationer and to the\n\nidiosyncratic circumstances of his situation.  And, it requires a\n\npredictive  decision, based in part on  the court's assessment of\n\nthe  probationer's  propensity toward  antisocial  conduct.   See\n                                                                 \n\nLacey,  661 F.2d at  1022; United States v.  Reed, 573 F.2d 1020,\n                                                 \n\n1024 (8th Cir. 1978).\n\n          Although  the trial  court possesses  wide latitude  in\n\nmaking  such determinations, that latitude is not unbounded.  The\n\ntest for abuse of discretion is well settled in this circuit:\n\n          In making discretionary judgments, a district\n          court abuses  its discretion when  a relevant\n          factor  deserving  of  significant weight  is\n          overlooked,  or  when an  improper  factor is\n          accorded  significant  weight,  or  when  the\n          court  considers  the   appropriate  mix   of\n          factors,  but commits  a  palpable  error  of\n          judgment   in   calibrating  the   decisional\n          scales.\n\nUnited  States v.  Roberts,  978 F.2d  17,  21 (1st  Cir.  1992);\n                          \n\naccord,  e.g., Independent Oil &amp; Chem. Workers of Quincy, Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nProcter &amp;  Gamble Mfg. Co.,  864 F.2d 927,  929 (1st Cir.  1988);\n                          \n\n                                15\n\nUnited  States v. Hastings, 847  F.2d 920, 924  (1st Cir.), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied,  488 U.S. 925 (1988).  Applying  this test, we are unable\n      \n\nto  discern any smidgen of abuse in the district court's decision\n\nto revoke  probation in  order to  ensure that appellant  receive\n\nnecessary medical treatment.   Based on a careful combing  of the\n\nrecord we  conclude that the court considered all the appropriate\n\nfactors and made no detectable mistake in weighing them.\n\n          Nor is  this conclusion undercut by  appellant's lament\n\nthat  the district  court, in  revoking probation,  impermissibly\n\npunished  him for  faultless  conduct.    This thesis  finds  its\n\ngenesis in appellant's view that because his mental health status\n\nis  involuntary  (most  recently   induced,  he  claims,  by  the\n\ngovernment,  which placed  him on,  then tried  to wean  him away\n\nfrom, Haldol), revocation of  probation is an improper punishment\n\nfor it.  This argument is lame.  See Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n660, 668 n.9 (1983)  (explaining that \"the probationer's  lack of\n\nfault in  violating a  term of probation  [does not]  necessarily\n\nprevent  a court from revoking probation\").  In this vein, United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Brown, 899 F.2d 189, 193 (2d Cir. 1990), appropriately\n                \n\nreminds  us that  \"though  a probation  violation  may result  in\n\nincarceration  .  . .,  this punishment  is  imposed not  for the\n\nviolation itself but for the prior criminal offense for which the\n\nprobationer was convicted.\"\n\n          We will not belabor the obvious, for it is difficult to\n\nimagine a much clearer case than the case at bar.  As appellant's\n\noutpatient treatment  program progressed, his  mental and  social\n\n                                16\n\nstate deteriorated;  he began  hallucinating about  messages from\n\ninanimate objects  and felt threatened by  satellites.  Moreover,\n\nhe made it plain that  he did not consider himself mentally  ill;\n\nthat,  left to his own  devices, he would  not take medication to\n\nalleviate the manifestations of his  disorder; and that he  would\n\nnot submit voluntarily to inpatient care.  Especially in light of\n\nappellant's  defiance   of  the  doctor's  instructions  and  his\n\nprevious involvement in threats of grievous bodily harm against a\n\npublic official, his  situation called out for  remediation.  The\n\ndistrict  court, after  finding that  appellant had  violated the\n\nterms  of  probation,  simply  answered  the  call,  effecting  a\n\ndisposition  that ensured  appropriate treatment  for appellant's\n\naffliction and, at the same time, alleviated a cognizable risk to\n\npublic safety.\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.8    In  the  original  case,\n\nappellant  gained his liberty subject to a condition of probation\n\nthat required  him to  submit to inpatient  psychiatric treatment\n\nwhen  medically  indicated.   Having  been fairly  warned  of the\n\nprospective  consequences of intransigence,  he nonetheless chose\n\n                    \n\n     8The  question  of appellant's  competency  at  the time  of\nrevocation  is not before us.  Appellant  did not make a claim of\nincompetency; no party sought a competency hearing, see 18 U.S.C.\n                                                       \n   4241(a) (1988); and the  record contains no  evidence of cause\nsufficient to impel  a court,  sua sponte, to  launch an  inquiry\n                                         \ninto competency.  A  history of psychiatric treatment, in  and of\nitself,  does not require a court to convene a competency hearing\non its own initiative.  See Hernandez-Hernandez v. United States,\n                                                                \n904 F.2d  758, 760-61 (1st Cir. 1990);  see also United States v.\n                                                              \nTeague,  956 F.2d  1427, 1431-32  (7th  Cir. 1992);  Hernandez v.\n                                                              \nYlst, 930 F.2d 714, 717-18 (9th Cir. 1991).\n    \n\n                                17\n\nto  flout the  condition.   Thereafter,  he  turned his  back  on\n\nnumerous  opportunities to  deliver himself  from the  revocation\n\nproceeding  by   agreeing  to  enter   the  hospital.     In  the\n\ncircumstances  of this  case,  the lower  court  did not  err  in\n\nfinding a violation of  the probation order, revoking appellant's\n\nprobationary  status,  and   imposing  a  one-year  incarcerative\n\nsentence, followed by a term of supervised release.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                18\n",

He was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, thought to be incurable but, hopefully, controllable through medication.

The district court then dismissed the remaining five counts of the indictment;  sentenced appellant to three years of imprisonment, suspended;  placed him on probation for five years;  and crafted a special set of conditions ancillary to the probationary term.

Defendant shall continue to submit to proper psychiatric treatment, inclusive of medication, upon his release from impatient [sic] hospitalization and shall consent to the Probation Office having access to his medical records....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, appellant stayed at St. Elizabeth's for much longer than sixty days following the imposition of sentence.  In the fall of 1990, the hospital discharged him.  In the same time frame, three other interrelated events occurred:  appellant took up residence at his mother's home in Massachusetts;  the sentencing court transferred jurisdiction over the matter to its sister court in the District of Massachusetts;  and probation supervision began in that district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While at St. Elizabeth's, appellant first met Dr. Geller, a Massachusetts-based psychiatrist.  After appellant sojourned to Massachusetts, he consulted regularly with Dr. Geller.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  His course of treatment centered around a monthly injection of haloperidol decanoate (Haldol).  The treatment protocol featured gradual decreases in dosage, aimed at lessening the patient's dependence upon the drug.  Appellant, who steadfastly maintained that he had no psychiatric disorder and that he should not be on medication at all, favored the dosage-reduction program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over a period of more than two years, Dr. Geller decreased Gallo's dosage from 150 milligrams per month to 25 milligrams per month.  In January of 1993, however, the doctor noted ominous behavioral changes.  For example, appellant began writing of his belief that satellites and lasers were attacking him and threatening national security;  in addition, he began acting in a manner reminiscent of how he had behaved immediately prior to his arrest in 1987.  When the dosage dropped to 20 milligrams per month, Dr. Geller became concerned that appellant was no longer responding appropriately to the medication.  Nonetheless, appellant expressed staunch opposition to resuming heavier doses of Haldol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dosage-reduction program continued until May 21, 1993, when Dr. Geller, due in part to Gallo's opposition to increasing the dosage and in part to the reported recurrence of hallucinogenic experiences, advised the probation office of his opinion that \"proper psychiatric treatment\" demanded \"an inpatient psychiatric admission\" because Gallo could not \"be effectively or safely managed on an outpatient basis.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  A probation officer immediately visited appellant and informed him of Dr. Geller's recommendation.  Appellant debunked the need for inpatient treatment and refused to cooperate.  The probation officer concluded that \"given Mr. Gallo's current mental state, ... he presents a potential risk to himself and/or others.\"   On the following day, the officer requested that the district court issue a warrant for violation of the conditions attendant to probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an evidentiary hearing, the district court, citing, inter alia, the risk to public safety, found that appellant needed inpatient care to determine the proper level of medication and get his treatment program back on track.  The court then ruled that appellant had violated the outstanding probation order by refusing to undergo hospitalization.  On this basis, the court revoked Gallo's probation, sentenced him to a one-year term of immurement, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3565(a)(2) (1988) (stipulating that, upon finding a probation violation, a court may \"revoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available ... at the time of the initial sentencing\"), and recommended that appellant serve the sentence in \"a facility that can provide the appropriate psychiatric treatment and ... hospitalization.\"   The court also imposed a follow-on term of supervised release, attaching seven special conditions to that term (including a condition requiring continued psychiatric care).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo appeals.  Although he parades several assignments of error before us, they march beneath two broad banners.  First, appellant challenges the probation order, asseverating that it neither required involuntary hospitalization nor afforded him adequate notice that, by refusing such care, he would be risking imprisonment.  Second, he challenges the revocation decision itself, including the finding that a violation occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE PROBATION ORDER</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause extends to probation revocation proceedings.  See Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1759-60, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973).  Fair warning of conduct that may result in revocation is an integral part of due process in such situations.  See United States v. Simmons, 812 F.2d 561, 565 (9th Cir.1987).  Here, appellant argues that the conditions of his probation did not require him to acquiesce in hospitalization, or, alternatively, did not provide fair warning that failure to do so might result in revocation.  We approach these arguments with full realization that the interpretation of a probation condition and whether it affords a probationer fair warning of the conduct proscribed thereby are essentially matters of law and, therefore, give rise to de novo review on appeal.  See In re Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1327 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that \"unadulterated questions of law\" customarily entail plenary review);  cf. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989) (establishing standard of de novo judicial review for construction of employee benefit plans).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>A. Scope of the Conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold question is whether inpatient treatment falls within the scope of the probation order.  We believe that the conditions of probation definitely encompass such treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation order states that appellant must \"continue to submit to proper psychiatric treatment, inclusive of medication,....\"  We are confident that this broadly phrased directive, read naturally and with due regard for context, covers inpatient care.  After all, the sentencing judge attached no qualifiers or words of limitation to the requirement of treatment, other than that the treatment be \"proper\" and \"psychiatric.\"   And in terms of language, we deem it significant that the condition directs that appellant \"continue to submit to proper psychiatric treatment....\"  (Emphasis supplied.)   When this verb usage is examined against the backdrop of the immediately preceding condition, which memorializes that appellant \"shall be confined to St. Elizabeth's Hospital\" for his initial treatment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> continuation of that treatment cannot fairly be read to exclude further hospitalization.  And, moreover, an expansive reading is especially compelling in light of the incurable nature of appellant's illness and his previous three-year stay in a psychiatric hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think, too, that the circumstances surrounding the probation order necessitate such an interpretation.  The plea agreement commemorated appellant's understanding that he would have to report on a regular basis to a \"mental health physician chosen by the government\" and \"follow the doctor's instructions unless excused by an order of the Court.\"   Thus, the plea agreement made pellucid that appropriate medical care lay at the heart of the agreed disposition of appellant's case--and hospitalization is a mainstay of appropriate medical care.  Moreover, the probationary period was to last for five years;  during so lengthy a span, it was certainly foreseeable that appellant's medical needs might evolve in such a way as to require rehospitalization.  Put bluntly, inpatient care, having proved necessary in the past, was well within the universe of treatment modalities that might prove \"proper\" in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances of this case, it is beyond serious question that the words \"proper psychiatric treatment\" were intended to include--and did include--the possibility of hospitalization.  Consequently, we reject appellant's complaint that the conditions attached to his probation did not require submission to inpatient medical care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>B. Sufficiency of the Warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has a fallback position.  He strives to persuade us that, even if the written conditions extended to enforced hospitalization, they did not afford him adequate notice that refusal to accept such treatment would constitute a violation of his probation.  In studying this proposition, we must ask whether appellant was chargeable with knowledge of the probation order's inclusive requirements (and the penalties that might be imposed for disregarding those requirements) when he spurned the request to admit himself to the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as now, a court order is read to proscribe conduct that is not in itself unlawful, the dictates of due process forbid the forfeiture of an actor's liberty by reason of such conduct unless he is given fair warning.  See United States v. Grant, 816 F.2d 440, 442 (9th Cir.1987);  United States v. Dane, 570 F.2d 840, 843 (9th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 959, 98 S.Ct. 3075, 57 L.Ed.2d 1124 (1978);  see also Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 191, 97 S.Ct. 990, 992-93, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (discussing fair warning in respect to conduct that is deemed criminal);  Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 351, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1701, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964) (similar).  Nevertheless, the fair warning doctrine does not provide a safe harbor for probationers who choose to ignore the obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, though a probationer is entitled to notice of what behavior will result in a violation, so that he may guide his actions accordingly, fair warning is not to be confused with the fullest, or most pertinacious, warning imaginable.  Conditions of probation do not have to be cast in letters six feet high, or to describe every possible permutation, or to spell out every last, self-evident detail.  See Green v. Abrams, 984 F.2d 41, 46-47 (2d Cir.1993) (holding that, though a probation order did not specify the time for payment of a fine, it gave sufficient notice that failure to pay the fine would work a violation);  see also United States v. Ferryman, 897 F.2d 584, 590 (1st Cir.)  (noting in an analogous context that defendants are entitled only to \"fair notice,\" not \"letter perfect notice\"), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 830, 111 S.Ct. 90, 112 L.Ed.2d 62 (1990).  Conditions of probation may afford fair warning even if they are not precise to the point of pedantry.  In short, conditions of probation can be written--and must be read--in a commonsense way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adherence to these principles demands that we uphold the adequacy of the warning furnished here.  We have three main reasons for reaching this conclusion.  First, we cannot fault the district court's finding that the phrase \"proper psychiatric treatment, inclusive of medication,\" on the basis of its plain meaning, see supra Part II(A), put appellant on notice that a refusal to follow doctor's instructions and submit to hospitalization would constitute a violation of the probation order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Cf., e.g. Mace v. Amestoy, 765 F.Supp. 847, 849-50 (D.Vt.1991) (ruling that a condition of probation requiring participation in and completion of a \"sexual therapy program\" put defendant on notice that therapy might necessitate admitting his sexual misconduct).  The challenged condition, read in context, itself provided fair warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there is nothing in the record to suggest either that appellant acted under a misapprehension or that he believed a refusal to accept inpatient admission would comport with the conditions of his probation.  A probationer who does not advance a credible claim that he was unaware, or misunderstood the scope, of the conditions of his probation is hard pressed to claim that he lacked fair warning.  See, e.g., United States v. Laughlin, 933 F.2d 786, 790 (9th Cir.1991).  So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the inquiry into fair warning is not necessarily confined to the four corners of the probation order.  See Grant, 816 F.2d at 442;  United States v. Romero, 676 F.2d 406, 407 (9th Cir.1982).  The meaning of a probation order may be illuminated by the judge's statements, the probation officer's instructions, or other events, any or all of which may assist in completing the notification process and in aiding the court to determine whether a probationer has been forewarned about what conduct could be deemed to transgress the probation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, several pieces of data buttress the district court's finding that appellant received fair warning.  In the first place, the plea agreement provided a prism through which the conditions of probation could be read--and that agreement made the scope of the conditions very clear.  See supra pp. 11-12.  In the second place, appellant signed his name below the list of conditions contemporaneous with the imposition of the original sentence.  In this fashion, he signified his understanding that, upon a finding of a violation, probation might be revoked.  Such a manifestation of acceptance of the terms, though rebuttable, is prima facie evidence of a probationer's knowing acceptance of the conditions in place at the time probation commenced.  See, e.g., Green, 984 F.2d at 47;  United States v. Barth, 899 F.2d 199, 203 (2d Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1083, 111 S.Ct. 953, 112 L.Ed.2d 1042 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also significant that both the probation officer and the court repeatedly explained to appellant the risk he was running.  The record reflects that the probation officer told appellant on May 21 that Dr. Geller believed inpatient treatment was essential to meet the goal of \"proper psychiatric treatment\" and exhorted appellant to comply.  Such a conversation may be considered as a component of the notification process.  See, e.g., Green, 984 F.2d at 47;  Romero, 676 F.2d at 407;  Mace, 765 F.Supp. at 849-50.   Furthermore, the district judge, who exhibited great sensitivity in his thoughtful handling of a difficult case, urged appellant on more than one occasion to relent and told him in no uncertain terms that, if his intransigence did not abate, he would be found in violation of the probation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, appellant timely received the probation order;  the conditions of probation contained therein clearly contemplated inpatient care if medically indicated;  and the penalties that might flow from violating those conditions were apparent.  Given the unvarnished terms of the special condition, appellant's previous three-year hospital stay, the tenor of the plea agreement, the probation officer's guidance, and the district judge's entreaties, appellant received ample notice of both the proscription against refusing inpatient treatment and the possible, if not certain, consequence of persisting in his chosen course of conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE REVOCATION DECISION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of appellate review pertaining to revocation decisions is not in doubt.  When a district court, after holding an evidentiary hearing, finds a probation violation and determines that revocation is a condign response, we will not prepare a palimpsest, but will scrutinize the district court's decision only for abuse of discretion.  See Burns v. United States, 287 U.S. 216, 222, 53 S.Ct. 154, 156, 77 L.Ed. 266 (1932);  United States v. Nolan, 932 F.2d 1005, 1006 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Morin, 889 F.2d 328, 331 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To reach the point at which revocation of probation is appropriate, a district court must complete a two-step pavane.  The first component is historical;  it involves the \"retrospective factual question whether the probationer has violated a condition of probation.\"  Black v. Romano, 471 U.S. 606, 611, 105 S.Ct. 2254, 2257, 85 L.Ed.2d 636 (1985).  The second component is judgmental;  it involves \"a discretionary determination by the sentencing authority whether violation of a condition warrants revocation of probation.\"  Id.  We proceed to review the district court's determinations as to each component, mindful, withal, that \"[t]he Due Process Clause ... imposes procedural and substantive limits on the revocation of the conditional liberty created by probation.\"  Id. at 610, 105 S.Ct. at 2257.A. The Violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a revocation proceeding, the prosecution need not prove the conduct charged beyond a reasonable doubt;  it is enough if the proof, reasonably viewed, satisfies the court that a violation occurred.  See United States v. Gordon, 961 F.2d 426, 429 (3d Cir.1992);  United States v. Czajak, 909 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1990);  United States v. Lacey, 661 F.2d 1021, 1022 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 961, 102 S.Ct. 2036, 72 L.Ed.2d 484 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government met this burden in the instant case.  Despite being fully apprised of Dr. Geller's views and receiving an urgent request from the probation officer, appellant did not agree to institutionalize himself.  Even after the judge drew a line in the sand, appellant remained adamant in his insistence that he would not submit to inpatient care.  On this stark record, the district court's explicit finding that appellant knowingly and wilfully elected to ignore a condition of his probation is entirely supportable.  It follows that the first step in the two-step pavane is easily ventured.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>B. The Disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When revocation of probation is committed to judicial discretion, judges should not regard it as a routine response to every probation violation.  Rather, revocation should be reserved for those instances in which the case history, coupled with the probationer's behavior, indicates that it is a fair, just, and sensible outcome.  See, e.g., Nolan, 932 F.2d at 1006;  United States v. Fryar, 920 F.2d 252, 257 (5th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 981, 111 S.Ct. 1635, 113 L.Ed.2d 730 (1991);  see also Steven A. Childress &amp; Martha S. Davis, Federal Standards of Review, Sec. 11.39 at 11-161 (2d ed. 1986).  This second step of the revocation analysis necessitates individualized attention to the particular probationer and to the idiosyncratic circumstances of his situation.  And, it requires a predictive decision, based in part on the court's assessment of the probationer's propensity toward antisocial conduct.  See Lacey, 661 F.2d at 1022;  United States v. Reed, 573 F.2d 1020, 1024 (8th Cir.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the trial court possesses wide latitude in making such determinations, that latitude is not unbounded.  The test for abuse of discretion is well settled in this circuit:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>In making discretionary judgments, a district court abuses its discretion when a relevant factor deserving of significant weight is overlooked, or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight, or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors, but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Roberts, 978 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992);  accord, e.g., Independent Oil &amp; Chem.  Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.1988);  United States v. Hastings, 847 F.2d 920, 924 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 925, 109 S.Ct. 308, 102 L.Ed.2d 327 (1988).  Applying this test, we are unable to discern any smidgen of abuse in the district court's decision to revoke probation in order to ensure that appellant receive necessary medical treatment.  Based on a careful combing of the record we conclude that the court considered all the appropriate factors and made no detectable mistake in weighing them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this conclusion undercut by appellant's lament that the district court, in revoking probation, impermissibly punished him for faultless conduct.  This thesis finds its genesis in appellant's view that because his mental health status is involuntary (most recently induced, he claims, by the government, which placed him on, then tried to wean him away from, Haldol), revocation of probation is an improper punishment for it.  This argument is lame.  See Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 668 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 2064, 2070 n. 9, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983) (explaining that \"the probationer's lack of fault in violating a term of probation [does not] necessarily prevent a court from revoking probation\").  In this vein, United States v. Brown, 899 F.2d 189, 193 (2d Cir.1990), appropriately reminds us that \"though a probation violation may result in incarceration ..., this punishment is imposed not for the violation itself but for the prior criminal offense for which the probationer was convicted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not belabor the obvious, for it is difficult to imagine a much clearer case than the case at bar.  As appellant's outpatient treatment program progressed, his mental and social state deteriorated;  he began hallucinating about messages from inanimate objects and felt threatened by satellites.  Moreover, he made it plain that he did not consider himself mentally ill;  that, left to his own devices, he would not take medication to alleviate the manifestations of his disorder;  and that he would not submit voluntarily to inpatient care.  Especially in light of appellant's defiance of the doctor's instructions and his previous involvement in threats of grievous bodily harm against a public official, his situation called out for remediation.  The district court, after finding that appellant had violated the terms of probation, simply answered the call, effecting a disposition that ensured appropriate treatment for appellant's affliction and, at the same time, alleviated a cognizable risk to public safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In the original case, appellant gained his liberty subject to a condition of probation that required him to submit to inpatient psychiatric treatment when medically indicated.  Having been fairly warned of the prospective consequences of intransigence, he nonetheless chose to flout the condition.  Thereafter, he turned his back on numerous opportunities to deliver himself from the revocation proceeding by agreeing to enter the hospital.  In the circumstances of this case, the lower court did not err in finding a violation of the probation order, revoking appellant's probationary status, and imposing a one-year incarcerative sentence, followed by a term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Police officers, who were investigating a threat to harm former Secretary of State George Schultz, intercepted Gallo as he emerged from a Washington motel on November 3, 1987.

But because he is still serving the supervised release term, the same circumstance does not render the remainder of his appeal moot.   See, e.g., Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 237, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 1559, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968) (holding that, although a sentence has been served, the presence of \"collateral consequences\" can save a case from mootness)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> By like token, Condition No. 2 itself states that it is to take effect \"upon [Gallo's] release from impatient [sic] hospitalization....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Appellant contends that, under Simmons, 812 F.2d 561, a probationer is routinely entitled to receive more specific notice of proscribed behavior than that delivered by means of formal conditions of probation.  We disagree.  A careful reading of the passage cited by appellant indicates that our view coincides with that of the Simmons court.  When the proscribed behavior is not itself criminal in nature, formal conditions of probation, plainly written, are generally thought to supply sufficient actual notice of proscribed activities.

Assuming, without deciding, that this is a meaningful distinction, we nonetheless reject the argument.  Dr. Geller's testimony at the revocation hearing, fully credited by the district court, made it clear that he treated appellant as he would have treated any other similarly afflicted patient, and that hospitalization was needed as an integral part of \"proper psychiatric treatment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The question of appellant's competency at the time of revocation is not before us.  Appellant did not make a claim of incompetency;  no party sought a competency hearing, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 4241(a) (1988);  and the record contains no evidence of cause sufficient to impel a court, sua sponte, to launch an inquiry into competency.  A history of psychiatric treatment, in and of itself, does not require a court to convene a competency hearing on its own initiative.  See Hernandez-Hernandez v.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We succinctly summarize the facts necessary to place this appeal into proper perspective, recounting disputed facts in a manner consistent with the district court's supportable findings of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 5, 1987, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia indicted defendant-appellant Edward L. Gallo on a medley of firearms charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Initially, the district court found appellant incompetent to stand trial and ordered him civilly committed.  He was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, thought to be incurable but, hopefully, controllable through medication.  Thereafter, in July of 1989, appellant pleaded guilty to a single count of possessing an unregistered firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C. Sec. 5861(j).  The district court then dismissed the remaining five counts of the indictment;  sentenced appellant to three years of imprisonment, suspended;  placed him on probation for five years;  and crafted a special set of conditions ancillary to the probationary term.  The first and second conditions possess particular pertinence for present purposes.  They read in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>1. The defendant shall be confined to St. Elizabeth's Hospital for a period of sixty days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>2. Defendant shall continue to submit to proper psychiatric treatment, inclusive of medication, upon his release from impatient [sic] hospitalization and shall consent to the Probation Office having access to his medical records....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, appellant stayed at St. Elizabeth's for much longer than sixty days following the imposition of sentence.  In the fall of 1990, the hospital discharged him.  In the same time frame, three other interrelated events occurred:  appellant took up residence at his mother's home in Massachusetts;  the sentencing court transferred jurisdiction over the matter to its sister court in the District of Massachusetts;  and probation supervision began in that district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While at St. Elizabeth's, appellant first met Dr. Geller, a Massachusetts-based psychiatrist.  After appellant sojourned to Massachusetts, he consulted regularly with Dr. Geller.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  His course of treatment centered around a monthly injection of haloperidol decanoate (Haldol).  The treatment protocol featured gradual decreases in dosage, aimed at lessening the patient's dependence upon the drug.  Appellant, who steadfastly maintained that he had no psychiatric disorder and that he should not be on medication at all, favored the dosage-reduction program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over a period of more than two years, Dr. Geller decreased Gallo's dosage from 150 milligrams per month to 25 milligrams per month.  In January of 1993, however, the doctor noted ominous behavioral changes.  For example, appellant began writing of his belief that satellites and lasers were attacking him and threatening national security;  in addition, he began acting in a manner reminiscent of how he had behaved immediately prior to his arrest in 1987.  When the dosage dropped to 20 milligrams per month, Dr. Geller became concerned that appellant was no longer responding appropriately to the medication.  Nonetheless, appellant expressed staunch opposition to resuming heavier doses of Haldol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dosage-reduction program continued until May 21, 1993, when Dr. Geller, due in part to Gallo's opposition to increasing the dosage and in part to the reported recurrence of hallucinogenic experiences, advised the probation office of his opinion that \"proper psychiatric treatment\" demanded \"an inpatient psychiatric admission\" because Gallo could not \"be effectively or safely managed on an outpatient basis.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  A probation officer immediately visited appellant and informed him of Dr. Geller's recommendation.  Appellant debunked the need for inpatient treatment and refused to cooperate.  The probation officer concluded that \"given Mr. Gallo's current mental state, ... he presents a potential risk to himself and/or others.\"   On the following day, the officer requested that the district court issue a warrant for violation of the conditions attendant to probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an evidentiary hearing, the district court, citing, inter alia, the risk to public safety, found that appellant needed inpatient care to determine the proper level of medication and get his treatment program back on track.  The court then ruled that appellant had violated the outstanding probation order by refusing to undergo hospitalization.  On this basis, the court revoked Gallo's probation, sentenced him to a one-year term of immurement, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3565(a)(2) (1988) (stipulating that, upon finding a probation violation, a court may \"revoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available ... at the time of the initial sentencing\"), and recommended that appellant serve the sentence in \"a facility that can provide the appropriate psychiatric treatment and ... hospitalization.\"   The court also imposed a follow-on term of supervised release, attaching seven special conditions to that term (including a condition requiring continued psychiatric care).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo appeals.  Although he parades several assignments of error before us, they march beneath two broad banners.  First, appellant challenges the probation order, asseverating that it neither required involuntary hospitalization nor afforded him adequate notice that, by refusing such care, he would be risking imprisonment.  Second, he challenges the revocation decision itself, including the finding that a violation occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE PROBATION ORDER</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause extends to probation revocation proceedings.  See Gagnon v. Scarpelli, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108785\"><a href=\"/opinion/108785/gagnon-v-scarpelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 782, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108785\"><a href=\"/opinion/108785/gagnon-v-scarpelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1756</span></a></span>, 1759-60, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108785\"><a href=\"/opinion/108785/gagnon-v-scarpelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span> (1973).  Fair warning of conduct that may result in revocation is an integral part of due process in such situations.  See United States v. Simmons, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483633\"><a href=\"/opinion/483633/united-states-v-rickey-dean-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span>, 565 (9th Cir.1987).  Here, appellant argues that the conditions of his probation did not require him to acquiesce in hospitalization, or, alternatively, did not provide fair warning that failure to do so might result in revocation.  We approach these arguments with full realization that the interpretation of a probation condition and whether it affords a probationer fair warning of the conduct proscribed thereby are essentially matters of law and, therefore, give rise to de novo review on appeal.  See In re Howard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610553\"><a href=\"/opinion/610553/in-re-extradition-of-curtis-andrew-howard-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1327 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that \"unadulterated questions of law\" customarily entail plenary review);  cf. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span> (1989) (establishing standard of de novo judicial review for construction of employee benefit plans).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>A. Scope of the Conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold question is whether inpatient treatment falls within the scope of the probation order.  We believe that the conditions of probation definitely encompass such treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation order states that appellant must \"continue to submit to proper psychiatric treatment, inclusive of medication,....\"  We are confident that this broadly phrased directive, read naturally and with due regard for context, covers inpatient care.  After all, the sentencing judge attached no qualifiers or words of limitation to the requirement of treatment, other than that the treatment be \"proper\" and \"psychiatric.\"   And in terms of language, we deem it significant that the condition directs that appellant \"continue to submit to proper psychiatric treatment....\"  (Emphasis supplied.)   When this verb usage is examined against the backdrop of the immediately preceding condition, which memorializes that appellant \"shall be confined to St. Elizabeth's Hospital\" for his initial treatment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> continuation of that treatment cannot fairly be read to exclude further hospitalization.  And, moreover, an expansive reading is especially compelling in light of the incurable nature of appellant's illness and his previous three-year stay in a psychiatric hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think, too, that the circumstances surrounding the probation order necessitate such an interpretation.  The plea agreement commemorated appellant's understanding that he would have to report on a regular basis to a \"mental health physician chosen by the government\" and \"follow the doctor's instructions unless excused by an order of the Court.\"   Thus, the plea agreement made pellucid that appropriate medical care lay at the heart of the agreed disposition of appellant's case--and hospitalization is a mainstay of appropriate medical care.  Moreover, the probationary period was to last for five years;  during so lengthy a span, it was certainly foreseeable that appellant's medical needs might evolve in such a way as to require rehospitalization.  Put bluntly, inpatient care, having proved necessary in the past, was well within the universe of treatment modalities that might prove \"proper\" in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances of this case, it is beyond serious question that the words \"proper psychiatric treatment\" were intended to include--and did include--the possibility of hospitalization.  Consequently, we reject appellant's complaint that the conditions attached to his probation did not require submission to inpatient medical care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>B. Sufficiency of the Warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has a fallback position.  He strives to persuade us that, even if the written conditions extended to enforced hospitalization, they did not afford him adequate notice that refusal to accept such treatment would constitute a violation of his probation.  In studying this proposition, we must ask whether appellant was chargeable with knowledge of the probation order's inclusive requirements (and the penalties that might be imposed for disregarding those requirements) when he spurned the request to admit himself to the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as now, a court order is read to proscribe conduct that is not in itself unlawful, the dictates of due process forbid the forfeiture of an actor's liberty by reason of such conduct unless he is given fair warning.

Nevertheless, the fair warning doctrine does not provide a safe harbor for probationers who choose to ignore the obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, though a probationer is entitled to notice of what behavior will result in a violation, so that he may guide his actions accordingly, fair warning is not to be confused with the fullest, or most pertinacious, warning imaginable.  Conditions of probation do not have to be cast in letters six feet high, or to describe every possible permutation, or to spell out every last, self-evident detail.  See Green v. Abrams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599023\"><a href=\"/opinion/599023/xenia-green-v-robert-abrams-attorney-general-of-the-state-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 46-47 (2d Cir.1993) (holding that, though a probation order did not specify the time for payment of a fine, it gave sufficient notice that failure to pay the fine would work a violation);  see also United States v. Ferryman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537614\"><a href=\"/opinion/537614/united-states-v-stanley-ferryman/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span>, 590 (1st Cir.)  (noting in an analogous context that defendants are entitled only to \"fair notice,\" not \"letter perfect notice\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></span> (1990).  Conditions of probation may afford fair warning even if they are not precise to the point of pedantry.  In short, conditions of probation can be written--and must be read--in a commonsense way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adherence to these principles demands that we uphold the adequacy of the warning furnished here.  We have three main reasons for reaching this conclusion.  First, we cannot fault the district court's finding that the phrase \"proper psychiatric treatment, inclusive of medication,\" on the basis of its plain meaning, see supra Part II(A), put appellant on notice that a refusal to follow doctor's instructions and submit to hospitalization would constitute a violation of the probation order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Cf., e.g. Mace v. Amestoy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2351054\"><a href=\"/opinion/2351054/mace-v-amestoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 849-50 (D.Vt.1991) (ruling that a condition of probation requiring participation in and completion of a \"sexual therapy program\" put defendant on notice that therapy might necessitate admitting his sexual misconduct).  The challenged condition, read in context, itself provided fair warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there is nothing in the record to suggest either that appellant acted under a misapprehension or that he believed a refusal to accept inpatient admission would comport with the conditions of his probation.  A probationer who does not advance a credible claim that he was unaware, or misunderstood the scope, of the conditions of his probation is hard pressed to claim that he lacked fair warning.  See, e.g., United States v. Laughlin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561362\"><a href=\"/opinion/561362/united-states-v-charles-laughlin-aka-charles-william-laughlin-john-tracy/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span>, 790 (9th Cir.1991).  So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the inquiry into fair warning is not necessarily confined to the four corners of the probation order.  See Grant, 816 F.2d at 442;  United States v. Romero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402588\"><a href=\"/opinion/402588/united-states-v-alfred-romero/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span>, 407 (9th Cir.1982).  The meaning of a probation order may be illuminated by the judge's statements, the probation officer's instructions, or other events, any or all of which may assist in completing the notification process and in aiding the court to determine whether a probationer has been forewarned about what conduct could be deemed to transgress the probation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, several pieces of data buttress the district court's finding that appellant received fair warning.  In the first place, the plea agreement provided a prism through which the conditions of probation could be read--and that agreement made the scope of the conditions very clear.  See supra pp. 11-12.  In the second place, appellant signed his name below the list of conditions contemporaneous with the imposition of the original sentence.  In this fashion, he signified his understanding that, upon a finding of a violation, probation might be revoked.  Such a manifestation of acceptance of the terms, though rebuttable, is prima facie evidence of a probationer's knowing acceptance of the conditions in place at the time probation commenced.  See, e.g., Green, 984 F.2d at 47;  United States v. Barth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538810\"><a href=\"/opinion/538810/united-states-v-leslie-r-barth/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, 203 (2d Cir.1990), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The record reflects that the probation officer told appellant on May 21 that Dr. Geller believed inpatient treatment was essential to meet the goal of \"proper psychiatric treatment\" and exhorted appellant to comply.  Such a conversation may be considered as a component of the notification process.  See, e.g., Green, 984 F.2d at 47;  Romero, 676 F.2d at 407;  Mace, 765 F.Supp. at 849-50.   Furthermore, the district judge, who exhibited great sensitivity in his thoughtful handling of a difficult case, urged appellant on more than one occasion to relent and told him in no uncertain terms that, if his intransigence did not abate, he would be found in violation of the probation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, appellant timely received the probation order;  the conditions of probation contained therein clearly contemplated inpatient care if medically indicated;  and the penalties that might flow from violating those conditions were apparent.  Given the unvarnished terms of the special condition, appellant's previous three-year hospital stay, the tenor of the plea agreement, the probation officer's guidance, and the district judge's entreaties, appellant received ample notice of both the proscription against refusing inpatient treatment and the possible, if not certain, consequence of persisting in his chosen course of conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE REVOCATION DECISION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of appellate review pertaining to revocation decisions is not in doubt.  When a district court, after holding an evidentiary hearing, finds a probation violation and determines that revocation is a condign response, we will not prepare a palimpsest, but will scrutinize the district court's decision only for abuse of discretion.

The first component is historical;  it involves the \"retrospective factual question whether the probationer has violated a condition of probation.\"  Black v.

The second component is judgmental;  it involves \"a discretionary determination by the sentencing authority whether violation of a condition warrants revocation of probation.\"  Id.

Despite being fully apprised of Dr. Geller's views and receiving an urgent request from the probation officer, appellant did not agree to institutionalize himself.  Even after the judge drew a line in the sand, appellant remained adamant in his insistence that he would not submit to inpatient care.  On this stark record, the district court's explicit finding that appellant knowingly and wilfully elected to ignore a condition of his probation is entirely supportable.  It follows that the first step in the two-step pavane is easily ventured.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>B.

Rather, revocation should be reserved for those instances in which the case history, coupled with the probationer's behavior, indicates that it is a fair, just, and sensible outcome.  See, e.g., Nolan, 932 F.2d at 1006;  United States v.

This second step of the revocation analysis necessitates individualized attention to the particular probationer and to the idiosyncratic circumstances of his situation.  And, it requires a predictive decision, based in part on the court's assessment of the probationer's propensity toward antisocial conduct.  See Lacey, 661 F.2d at 1022;  United States v. Reed, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"354364\"><a href=\"/opinion/354364/united-states-v-mario-s-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span>, 1024 (8th Cir.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the trial court possesses wide latitude in making such determinations, that latitude is not unbounded.

Applying this test, we are unable to discern any smidgen of abuse in the district court's decision to revoke probation in order to ensure that appellant receive necessary medical treatment.  Based on a careful combing of the record we conclude that the court considered all the appropriate factors and made no detectable mistake in weighing them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this conclusion undercut by appellant's lament that the district court, in revoking probation, impermissibly punished him for faultless conduct.  This thesis finds its genesis in appellant's view that because his mental health status is involuntary (most recently induced, he claims, by the government, which placed him on, then tried to wean him away from, Haldol), revocation of probation is an improper punishment for it.  This argument is lame.  See Bearden v. Georgia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110941\"><a href=\"/opinion/110941/bearden-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>, 668 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110941\"><a href=\"/opinion/110941/bearden-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span> (1983) (explaining that \"the probationer's lack of fault in violating a term of probation [does not] necessarily prevent a court from revoking probation\").  In this vein, United States v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538808\"><a href=\"/opinion/538808/united-states-v-theodore-lawrence-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span>, 193 (2d Cir.1990), appropriately reminds us that \"though a probation violation may result in incarceration ..., this punishment is imposed not for the violation itself but for the prior criminal offense for which the probationer was convicted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not belabor the obvious, for it is difficult to imagine a much clearer case than the case at bar.  As appellant's outpatient treatment program progressed, his mental and social state deteriorated;  he began hallucinating about messages from inanimate objects and felt threatened by satellites.  Moreover, he made it plain that he did not consider himself mentally ill;  that, left to his own devices, he would not take medication to alleviate the manifestations of his disorder;  and that he would not submit voluntarily to inpatient care.  Especially in light of appellant's defiance of the doctor's instructions and his previous involvement in threats of grievous bodily harm against a public official, his situation called out for remediation.  The district court, after finding that appellant had violated the terms of probation, simply answered the call, effecting a disposition that ensured appropriate treatment for appellant's affliction and, at the same time, alleviated a cognizable risk to public safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Having been fairly warned of the prospective consequences of intransigence, he nonetheless chose to flout the condition.  Thereafter, he turned his back on numerous opportunities to deliver himself from the revocation proceeding by agreeing to enter the hospital.  In the circumstances of this case, the lower court did not err in finding a violation of the probation order, revoking appellant's probationary status, and imposing a one-year incarcerative sentence, followed by a term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Police officers, who were investigating a threat to harm former Secretary of State George Schultz, intercepted Gallo as he emerged from a Washington motel on November 3, 1987.

Sec. 7B1.4, failed adequately to consider the Sentencing Commission's policy statement.  Since appellant has now served the one-year sentence in full, he has withdrawn this claim.  But because he is still serving the supervised release term, the same circumstance does not render the remainder of his appeal moot.   See, e.g., Carafas v.

We disagree.  A careful reading of the passage cited by appellant indicates that our view coincides with that of the Simmons court.  When the proscribed behavior is not itself criminal in nature, formal conditions of probation, plainly written, are generally thought to supply sufficient actual notice of proscribed activities.

Assuming, without deciding, that this is a meaningful distinction, we nonetheless reject the argument.  Dr. Geller's testimony at the revocation hearing, fully credited by the district court, made it clear that he treated appellant as he would have treated any other similarly afflicted patient, and that hospitalization was needed as an integral part of \"proper psychiatric treatment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The question of appellant's competency at the time of revocation is not before us.  Appellant did not make a claim of incompetency;  no party sought a competency hearing, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 4241(a) (1988);  and the record contains no evidence of cause sufficient to impel a court, sua sponte, to launch an inquiry into competency.  A history of psychiatric treatment, in and of itself, does not require a court to convene a competency hearing on its own initiative.  See Hernandez-Hernandez v.
