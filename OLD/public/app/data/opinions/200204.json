Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n           Campbell and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Howard B. Myers with whom Carolyn Cole Durst, Myers\nAssociates, PLLC, Michael Hoenig, Roger Arentzen, Miriam Skolnik,\nand Herzfeld & Rubin, P.C. were on brief for appellants.\n\n     Alan L. Cantor with whom Edward M. Swartz, David P. Angueira,\nand Swartz & Swartz were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        November 14, 2002\n\f             BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.         This appeal arises out of\n\nan action brought in the district court arising from a collision on\n\nFebruary 19,     1991,   in    Conway,   New    Hampshire,    between      a   1986\n\nVolkswagen Vanagon and a 1979 AMC Concorde. The Vanagon was driven\n\nby David Trull.    His two sons Benjamin and Nathaniel were seated in\n\nthe rear     passenger   seat.      Benjamin     was    killed;    his   brother,\n\nNathaniel, received serious injuries.             The father, David Trull,\n\nbrought this action on behalf of Benjamin's estate and Nathaniel,\n\nwho was a minor at the time the complaint was brought.\n\n             The plaintiffs asserted claims in strict liability and\n\nnegligence     against   both     defendants-appellants           Volkswagen     of\n\nAmerica, Inc. and Volkswagen, AG (collectively \"VW\"). The evidence\n\nwas essentially the same as to both theories of liability.                      The\n\ndistrict court instructed the jury:            \"The plaintiffs have asserted\n\nstrict   product    liability     and    negligence      claims     against     the\n\ndefendant.     However, they need not prove both claims to recover.\n\nThey will be entitled to recover if they prove one or the other of\n\nthese claims.\"\n\n             Plaintiffs' claim of liability was that the 1986 Vanagon\n\nhad   been   defectively      designed   and    was    unreasonably      dangerous\n\nbecause it was not equipped with lap/shoulder belts in each of the\n\nrear seats.     The only passenger body restraints were lap belts.\n\nThe jury, in answer to specific questions, found that VW was not\n\nliable in strict liability but was liable in negligence.                         It\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fawarded Nathaniel Trull the sum of $8,917,335.27.         It awarded the\n\nestate of Benjamin Trull $1,290,980.70.\n\n           This is the second time that this case has been before\n\nus.   In the first trial VW prevailed.     The plaintiffs appealed on\n\nthe ground that the trial judge erred in putting the burden of\n\nproof as to enhancement of injuries on them.         We certified that\n\nissue to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.       Trull v. Volkswagen of\n\nAm., 187 F.3d 88 (1st Cir. 1999).          The Supreme Court of New\n\nHampshire ruled that in a damages enhancement situation the burden\n\nof proof falls on the defendant.    Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,\n\n761 A.2d 477 (N.H. 2000).     We remanded to the district court for a\n\nnew trial.    Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 229 F.3d 343 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).    We affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.    THE VERDICTS\n\n           There are four issues posited for review. Our discussion\n\nof the issues does not follow the order in which they are argued in\n\nVW's brief.    We start with VW's contention that the verdicts were\n\ninconsistent,    that   the   negligence   finding   of   liability   was\n\nnullified by the jury finding that VW was not liable on the claim\n\nof strict liability and therefore there should be either a judgment\n\nfor VW or a new trial.\n\n            The case was tried from the start by plaintiffs on the\n\ntheory that the 1986 Vanagon was defectively designed because it\n\nlacked lap/shoulder belts on the rear seats and this omission\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcaused the death of Benjamin Trull and seriously injured Nathaniel\n\nTrull.   In its jury instructions the district court explained\n\nseparately the elements of strict liability and negligence.      No\n\nobjection was made by VW to the verdict forms handed to the jury or\n\nthe risk of inconsistent verdicts until after the clerk had been\n\ninstructed by the court \"to enter judgment in accordance with the\n\nspecial findings of the jury\" and the jury discharged.\n\n            VW implies in its brief at page 15 that it did not have\n\nthe time to make any objections or that the district court speeded\n\nup the post-verdict process to thwart any objections.      There is\n\nnothing in the record to substantiate this implication.    Labeling\n\nthe post-verdict session a \"truncated ten-minute session\" does not\n\nchange the facts.     VW's attorneys may have been shocked by the\n\nverdict but there is nothing in the record to indicate that VW\n\nwished to object to anything.\n\n            The record shows that VW did not object to the verdict\n\nforms at any time prior to their submission to the jury.        The\n\nrecord further establishes that there were no objections to the\n\njury instructions at any time either prior to or after their\n\ndelivery.   This means that VW has waived its right to object to any\n\nforeseeable combination of proper responses to the questions posed\n\non the verdict forms.   It also means that VW was satisfied with the\n\njury instructions until the jury returned the verdicts.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          If we assume arguendo the verdicts were inconsistent, and\n\nas to this we have serious doubts, there can be no doubt that VW's\n\nfailure to follow the applicable Rule of Civil Procedure bars its\n\nappeal.   It is clear to us that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n49(b) applies to the verdict forms, not Rule 49(a) as VW asserts.\n\nRule 49(a) states:    \"The court may require a jury to return only a\n\nspecial verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each\n\nissue of fact.\"    Here, for example, a special verdict form could\n\nhave included questions such as whether the brothers were wearing\n\nlap belts at the time of the collision.   When such a form is used,\n\nthe jury makes only findings of fact; it is up to the court to\n\napply the law.    Babcock v. Gen. Motors Corp., 299 F.3d 60, 63 (1st\n\nCir. 2002); see 9A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure, § 2503 (2d ed. 1994).   There can be little\n\ndoubt that this was not the type of verdict form used in this case.\n\n          The verdict form in this case fell within the ambit of\n\nRule 49(b) which addresses general verdicts and states: \"The court\n\nmay submit to the jury, together with appropriate forms for a\n\ngeneral verdict, written interrogatories upon one or more issues of\n\nfact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict.\"\n\n          Although there were no written interrogatories submitted\n\nto the jury, it is clear that the two liability questions submitted\n\nto the jury were general verdict forms under Rule 49(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Strict Liability\n\n                 1. Do you find by a preponderance of\n          the evidence that the 1986 Vanagon was\n          defectively  designed   because it   lacked\n          lap/shoulder belts in the rear seating\n          positions?\n                               NO\n                          (Yes or No)\n          Negligence\n\n                 3. Do you find by a preponderance of\n          the evidence that the defendant was negligent\n          in designing and/or testing the 1986 Vanagon\n          because it lacked lap/shoulder belts in the\n          rear seating positions?\n\n                                 YES\n                             (Yes or No)\n\n          The last sentence of Rule 49(b) specifically discusses\n\ninconsistent answers to questions submitted to the jury: \"When the\n\nanswers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is\n\nlikewise inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment shall not\n\nbe entered, but the court shall return the jury for further\n\nconsideration of its answers and verdict or shall order a new\n\ntrial.\"\n\n          We have held that under Rule 49(b), objections to the\n\ninconsistency of verdicts must be made after the verdict is read\n\nand before the jury is discharged.     E.g., Babcock, 299 F.3d at 63;\n\nMerchant v. Ruhle, 740 F.2d 86, 89 (1st Cir. 1984); Skillin v.\n\nKimball, 643 F.2d 19, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1981).        We rule that VW\n\nforfeited its objection to the alleged inconsistency by failing to\n\nobject at any time prior to the jury's discharge.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            The instructions made it clear that the jury was to be\n\nasked to decide the issue of liability on both the theory of strict\n\nliability and the theory of negligence. The verdict forms had been\n\nexamined by counsel for VW before they were submitted. VW's reason\n\nfor its failure to object at the critical times was that the\n\nverdicts did not become inconsistent until after the jury had\n\ncompleted them.        But we cannot accept this; to do so would\n\ncountenance \"agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error as a\n\nweapon of appellate advocacy.\" McIsaac v. Didriksen Fishing Corp.,\n\n809 F.2d 129, 134 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting Merchant, 740 F.2d at\n\n88-89); see also Babcock, 299 F.3d at 64.               By failing to timely\n\nobject to the jury instructions, VW thereby waived any objection it\n\nmay have had.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.          Moreover, that failure to\n\nobject greatly limits the scope of subsequent review.               See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 61.\n\n            Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides\n\nin pertinent part:      \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or\n\nthe failure to give an instruction unless that party objects\n\nthereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating\n\ndistinctly    the     matter   objected      to   and   the    grounds    of    the\n\nobjection.\"     Rule 51 has been stringently enforced to the extent\n\nthat   a   district    court   judge    cannot    waive   it    even     with   the\n\nacquiescence of counsel.        Poulin v. Greer, 18 F.3d 979, 982 (1st\n\nCir. 1994); Smith v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 877 F.2d 1106, 1109 (1st\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fCir. 1989); McGrath v. Spirito, 733 F.2d 967, 969 (1st Cir. 1984)\n\n(\"[Rule 51] is binding on both the court and attorneys and neither\n\ncan circumvent it.\").   And, of critical importance here, a failure\n\nto object as required by Rule 51 deprives the non-objecting party\n\nof review under Rule 61, either before the trial court on a post-\n\ntrial motion or on appeal.     Babcock, 299 F.3d at 64; Scarfo v.\n\nCabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 941 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          We quote extensively from our prior opinion in Babcock,\n\n299 F.3d at 64-65:\n\n               The only exception to nullification of\n          appellate issues for failure to follow Rule 51\n          is the plain error doctrine. Smith v. Kmart\n          Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 28-29 (1st Cir. 1999).\n          Reversal under that doctrine requires that\n          (1) there be error; (2) the error was \"plain\"\n          (i.e. obvious and clear under current law);\n          (3) the error affected substantial rights; and\n          (4) the error threatened a miscarriage of\n          justice.    Danco, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n          Inc., 178 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1999). We have\n          applied the plain error doctrine \"stringently\"\n          in civil cases.     Id.   Accordingly, we will\n          grant relief on an issue that has been\n          forfeited on appeal only \"to prevent a clear\n          miscarriage of justice . . . or where the\n          error   seriously    affected   the   fairness,\n          integrity or public reputation of judicial\n          proceedings.\"    Romano v. U-Haul Int'l, 233\n          F.3d 655, 664 (1st Cir. 2000) (citations and\n          internal quotation marks omitted). We might\n          find plain error where \"'the failure to raise\n          the claim below deprived the reviewing court\n          of helpful factfinding; . . . the issue is one\n          of constitutional magnitude; . . . the omitted\n          argument is highly persuasive; . . . the\n          opponent would suffer special prejudice; . . .\n          and, perhaps most importantly, . . . the issue\n          is of great importance to the public.'\" Id.\n          (quoting Play Time, Inc. v. LDDS Metromedia\n\n                                -8-\n\f          Communications, Inc., 123 F.3d 23, 30 n.8 (1st\n          Cir. 1997) (alterations in original).\n\n              We examine New Hampshire law to determine\n          whether there was plain error below. If New\n          Hampshire law forbade combining a count in\n          negligence with a count in strict liability in\n          a tort case, the plain error doctrine might be\n          applicable.   But New Hampshire law does not\n          prohibit submitting both negligence and strict\n          liability claims to the jury. See, e.g., Cyr\n          v. J.I. Case Co., 652 A.2d 685, 693 (N.H.\n          1995); Thibault v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 395\n          A.2d 843, 849 (N.H. 1978); Greenland v. Ford\n          Motor Co., Inc., 347 A.2d 159, 163 (N.H. 1975).\n          The most that can be said is that submission of\n          both claims is frowned upon.     Thibault, 395\n          A.2d at 849 (\"While . . . both counts are\n          permitted, we do not recommend to plaintiffs\n          that counts in both negligence and strict\n          liability be submitted to the jury because of\n          the confusion which is created.\"); see also\n          Greenland, 347 A.2d at 163. We will not create\n          a general rule of prohibition in light of the\n          New Hampshire Supreme Court's reluctance to do\n          so.   We rule that it was not plain error to\n          submit counts in both negligence and strict\n          liability to the jury.\n\n          For the reasons set forth in Babcock we find there was no\n\nplain error here.\n\n          The only question on the issue of claimed inconsistent\n\nverdicts that does not admit of an easy solution is whether the\n\nverdicts were inconsistent.   The district court held that they were\n\nnot, stating:\n\n             Taking into account the New Hampshire law\n          applicable to each claim and the evidence that\n          was adduced at trial, the court finds that the\n          jury's answers to special verdict questions one\n          and three propounded in each of the plaintiffs'\n\n                                -9-\n\f           cases were not inconsistent.        The jury\n           evaluated the evidence in light of each claim\n           and answered the special verdict questions as\n           instructed.    The defendant's inconsistency\n           claim must fail on its merits.\n\n           Our review of the district court's ruling is de novo\n\nbecause this is a pure question of law.   See Gamma Audio & Video,\n\nInc. v. Ean-Chea, 11 F.3d 1106, 1114 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           We note first that there is a distinct difference in the\n\nwording of the two questions.    The question on strict liability\n\nstated:\n\n           Strict Liability\n\n                  1. Do you find by a preponderance of\n           the evidence that the 1986 Vanagon was\n           defectively  designed    because    it  lacked\n           lap/shoulder  belts   in   the   rear  seating\n           positions?\n\n           The question was limited only to defective design.   The\n\nquestion on negligence, however, had more flesh to it:\n\n           Negligence\n\n                  3. Do you find by a preponderance of\n           the evidence that the defendant was negligent\n           in designing and/or testing the 1986 Vanagon\n           because it lacked lap/shoulder belts in the\n           rear seating positions? (Emphasis added.)\n\n           Under the wording of the negligence question the jury\n\ncould have found Volkswagen liable on one or more of the following\n\ngrounds:   because its design of the rear seat restraint mechanism\n\ndid not include lap/shoulder belts; there was negligent testing by\n\nVW that did not disclose that lap/shoulder belts were needed to\n\n                                -10-\n\frestrain the torso of a passenger in the rear seat from being thrown\n\nviolently    forward    in      an   accident;    or   that   VW's    negligence\n\nencompassed both design and testing.\n\n            VW has cited cases from other jurisdictions that have\n\nruled as a matter of law that verdicts based on a finding of no\n\nstrict   liability     in   a   defective     design   case   would   nullify   a\n\nliability finding of negligent design.              As we stated in Babcock,\n\nhowever,\n\n            We need not determine whether that proposition\n            is correct - it is enough to conclude, as we\n            do, that New Hampshire law is not so clear on\n            the question that it was plain error for the\n            district court to enter judgment on the jury's\n            verdict.\n\n299 F.3d at 65. It is clear that under New Hampshire tort law, both\n\nstrict liability and negligence questions can be submitted to the\n\njury.    See Thibault, 395 A.2d at 849; Greenland, 347 A.2d at 163.\n\nMoreover, as noted above, the negligence question submitted to the\n\njury referenced \"negligent           design and/or testing\" as possible\n\ngrounds for a finding of liability.\n\n            Therefore, in the context of this case, we hold that it\n\nwas not plain error for the district court to enter judgment upon\n\nverdicts indicating liability for negligence but not for strict\n\nliability.   The jury was instructed properly on the legal elements\n\nof strict liability and negligence.              The jury was also instructed\n\nthat both liability questions were to be answered.               It is obvious\n\nthat the jury understood the instructions and its duty.                It found\n\n                                       -11-\n\fno liability on strict liability and did not answer the damages part\n\nof the question.     No questions evincing confusion or ignorance were\n\nasked of the court by the jury.             It is apparent that the jury\n\nunderstood that the focus of strict liability is on whether the\n\ndesign itself is unreasonably dangerous whereas in a negligence case\n\nthe focus is on the conduct of the manufacturer, which brings us to\n\nthe next issue, the evidence of VW's negligence.\n\nII.    EVIDENCE OF NEGLIGENCE\n\n             VW claims that plaintiff failed \"to adduce sufficient\n\nevidence to establish negligence.\"          VW Br. at 17.     It first argues\n\nthat the standard of review is de novo.          This position is contrary\n\nto    the   applicable   law.   VW   filed   a   post-trial    motion   for   a\n\nremittitur or, in the alternative, for a new trial.             It also filed\n\na motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.                It is\n\nthese motions that determine the standard of review.\n\n             In reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law we must evaluate the evidence and inferences adduced\n\ntherefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.            Raymond v.\n\nRaymond Corp., 938 F.2d 1518, 1521 (1st Cir. 1991); Austin v.\n\nLincoln Equip. Assocs., Inc., 888 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nSuch a motion should be granted by the district court only if, as\n\na matter of law, the evidence would lead a reasonable jury to only\n\none conclusion       that the defendant was entitled to judgment.\n\nHendricks & Assocs., Inc. v. Daewoo Corp., 923 F.2d 209, 214 (1st\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fCir. 1991).       And the reviewing court may only reverse a trial\n\njudge's ruling denying a motion for a new trial if the district\n\ncourt's      decision    is   so    clearly    mistaken   as   to   constitute   a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.             Raymond, 938 F.2d at 1522; Gutierrez-\n\nRodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 558 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n              With this standard of review as our guide we start our\n\nanalysis.      Both parties agree that the applicable standard of care\n\nis that of a reasonably prudent automobile manufacturer.                We first\n\nnote that the front seats of the Vanagon were equipped with lap and\n\nshoulder belts.         This means that this type of body restraint was\n\nknown and available to VW. There was evidence by one of plaintiff's\n\nexperts as follows: \"There was sufficient evidence before 1986 [the\n\nyear of the Vanagon's manufacture] to show that lap belts alone just\n\ncan't do the job – to protect a person, you need a lap and shoulder\n\nbelt.\"\n\n              The results and evaluation of tests performed by VW\n\nrelative to the safety afforded rear seat passengers equipped with\n\nlap belts only, and those with both lap and shoulder belts, were\n\nexhibits in the case.         The tests were performed by VW on April 27,\n\n1981, which was five years prior to the manufacture of the Vanagon\n\nin   which    Benjamin     and     Nathaniel   Trull   were    passengers.   The\n\npertinent conclusions that VW made were as follows:\n\n                        Limited protection by lap belt\n\n                  The occupant restrained with lap belt was\n              displaced forward due to elongation of the\n\n                                        -13-\n\f          belt.   The rotational movement of the upper\n          torso about the hip point enables head contact\n          with the back rest in front of it.\n\n          1.     Evaluation regarding injury risk\n\n                 Three-point belt\n\n                 The occupant restrained with\n                 three-point   belt   is   well\n                 protected in a frontal crash.\n                 No contact with the steering\n                 wheel,    instrument    panel,\n                 transverse beam, etc. (photo 5\n                 and 6).\n\n                 Lap belt\n\n                 Lap-belt restrained vehicle occupants are\n                 subject to a high degree of head and\n                 cervical vertebrae injuries. The lap belt\n                 enables a rotational motion about the hip\n                 point. (Photo 7, 8 and 9).\n\n          There was testimony by one of plaintiffs' expert witnesses\n\n(D'Aulerio) that the use of a shoulder belt would have eliminated\n\nthe head injuries to Nathaniel and Benjamin.   The witness explained\n\nto the jury that the lap belt alone acted as a lever so that as the\n\ntorso and head were bent they were accelerated forward and inclined\n\ndownward at the moment      of   impact.   The lap belt, therefore,\n\naccording to the expert, was partially responsible for the head\n\ninjuries received by both brothers.\n\n          Another of plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Anthony Sances, had\n\na master's degree in physics and a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering.\n\nDr. Sances had considerable experience in determining the cause and\n\nextent of injuries resulting from automobile collisions; he had been\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\finvolved in over a thousand cases.    It was his opinion that there\n\nwould have been no head injuries to either Benjamin or Nathaniel if\n\nthey had been wearing shoulder belts.\n\n          We summarize other record evidence of negligence:\n\n          It was known since the 1950's in the automotive\n          industry that shoulder belts restrain forward\n          movement of occupants while lap belts do not;\n\n          It was known for a long time before 1986 that\n          lap belts alone did not offer adequate\n          protection to occupants and that lap-shoulder\n          belts were needed to do the job;\n\n          In 1980, NHTSA sent a letter to all motor\n          vehicle manufacturers, including Volkswagen in\n          which it stated, \"rear seat three-point belts\n          should be offered for additional protection to\n          rear seat occupants. They have been offered by\n          Volvo, Mercedes and a few others for many years\n          as standard equipment\";\n\n          In 1986, Volkswagen sold the Vanagon in four\n          foreign countries with rear shoulder harnesses\n          as standard equipment;\n\n          In 1986, Volkswagen sold four out of five of\n          its sedan type vehicles in the United States\n          with rear lap shoulder belts as standard\n          equipment;\n\n          Since the early 1970's, all Vanagons had anchor\n          points   which    would   have   allowed    for\n          installation of lap-shoulder belts in the rear\n          seats;\n\n          Volkswagen offered the same rear seat shoulder\n          harness as optional equipment for the 1986\n          Vanagon sold in the United States which was\n          standard equipment in other countries.\n\n          Based on our examination of the record, we have no\n\ndifficulty ruling that there was a plethora of evidence from which\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fthe jury could find that VW was negligent in not equipping the\n\nVanagon sold to plaintiff with shoulder belts on the rear passenger\n\nseats and this negligence was the proximate cause of the enhanced\n\ninjuries suffered by Nathaniel and Benjamin in the collision.\n\nIII.   THE DAMAGES AWARDED NATHANIEL TRULL\n\n          VW contends that the award of $8,917,335.27 \"is wildly\n\nexcessive, justifying substantial reduction.\"   VW Br. at 48.   Our\n\nstandard of review of damages is abuse of discretion:\n\n              We review the denial of a motion for a\n          remittitur for abuse of discretion.         See\n          Anthony, 17 F.3d at 493; McDonald v. Federal\n          Laboratories, Inc., 724 F.2d 243, 246 (1st Cir.\n          1984).   We will find an abuse of discretion\n          only if the jury's verdict exceeds \"any\n          rational appraisal or estimate of the damages\n          that could be based on the evidence before the\n          jury.\" Milone v. Moceri Family, Inc., 847 F.2d\n          35, 36 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting Segal v.\n          Gilbert Color Systems, Inc., 746 F.2d 78, 81\n          (1st Cir. 1984)).     We have noted that \"the\n          obstacles which stand in the path of\" such\n          claims of excessiveness \"are formidable ones.\"\n          Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 215 (1st Cir.\n          1987).   Translating legal damage into money\n          damages is a matter \"peculiarly within a jury's\n          ken,\" especially in cases involving intangible,\n          non-economic losses. Id.; see also Correa v.\n          Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1197 (1st\n          Cir. 1995) (\"An appellate court's normal\n          disinclination   to    second-guess  a   jury's\n          evaluation of the proper amount of damages is\n          magnified where, as here, the damages entail a\n          monetary valuation of intangible losses, and\n          the trial judge, having seen and heard the\n          witnesses at first hand, accepts the jury's\n          appraisal.\"), cert. denied 517 U.S. 1136\n          (1996). Viewing the evidence in the light most\n          favorable to the verdict, the jury's assessment\n          of damages will not be disturbed unless it is\n          \"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the\n\n                               -16-\n\f             conscience of the court, or so high that it\n             would be a denial of justice to permit it to\n             stand.\" Id. (quoting Segal, 746 F.2d at 80-81)\n             (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nSmith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 29-30 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n             VW    points   to     a   number     of   mental,   physical,   and\n\npsychological problems with which Nathaniel was afflicted prior to\n\nthe accident.       One of the bedrock foundations of tort law is that\n\nthe defendant takes the plaintiff as it finds him.                See Figueroa-\n\nTorres v. Toledo-Davilla, 232 F.3d 270, 275 (1st Cir. 2000); Dotty\n\nv. Sewall, 908 F.2d 1053, 1059 (1st Cir. 1990); W. Page Keeton et\n\nal., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts § 43 (5th ed. 1984).\n\nVW points out that there was conflicting evidence on how seriously\n\nNathaniel was injured.           From our vantage point we focus on the\n\nevidence favorable to the verdict.              See Smith, 177 F.3d at 30.\n\n             VW    claims   that   based   on     unrefuted   medical   evidence\n\nNathaniel did not suffer a brain injury in the accident.                To put it\n\nin VW's words:       \"In the crash he sustained a head injury consisting\n\nof a skull fracture and epidural hematoma without brain damage and\n\nsequelae.\"        VW Br. at 49 (emphasis in original).           But on cross-\n\nexamination, VW's expert medical witness, Dr. Mendelsohn, testified\n\nthat Nathaniel Trull did, in fact sustain a change in his condition,\n\nmaking him worse.\n\n             There was competent evidence that Nathaniel sustained a\n\ndepressed skull fracture causing blood to form inside the brain that\n\nhad to be drained away by an operation called a craniotomy.\n\n                                       -17-\n\f            There was evidence by a neuropsychologist and a clinical\n\npsychologist both of whom had treated Nathaniel before and after the\n\naccident.    The opinion of these experts was that Nathaniel's head\n\ntrauma exacerbated his pre-existing condition so that he is now\n\nunable to live independently and will have to live under supervised\n\nstructured conditions for the rest of his life.\n\n            There was evidence by a medical economist that the life\n\nexpectancy of Nathaniel was 58.1 years and that the economic loss\n\ndue to the injury was approximately $5.3 million.             As the district\n\ncourt pointed out in its order denying VW's motion for a remittitur,\n\nVW did not submit any economic evidence. The figure of $5.3 million\n\ndid not include any amount for pain and suffering or other hedonic\n\ndamages.\n\n            The jury was properly instructed that              Nathaniel was\n\nentitled to recover for past and future, pain and suffering, mental\n\nanguish and disability.\n\n            We   rule   that   the   district   court   did   not   abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion for a remittitur.\n\nIV.   THE EXCLUSION OF TEST REPORTS IN THE GERMAN LANGUAGE\n\n            This issue need not detain us long.               VW offered as\n\nexhibits test reports in the German language.            Plaintiff objected\n\nand the court informed VW that the reports would not be admitted\n\nunless they were translated into English.          This was not done.       The\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fdistrict court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the\n\ndocuments.\n\n          The judgment below is affirmed.   Costs on appeal awarded\n\nto plaintiff.\n\n\n\n                 - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f            CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.          I concur in\n\nthe judgment.    I write separately because I do not understand why\n\nmy colleagues, after finding that VW did not preserve the issue of\n\nverdict inconsistency, have gone on to discuss that issue to the\n\nextent they do, even suggesting a likely consistency between the\n\njury's two verdicts.        Whether or not the jury's responses on\n\ndefective design and negligence were inconsistent, VW's failure to\n\npreserve the inconsistency issue, and the absence of plain error,\n\nmakes the inconsistency issue irrelevant.          New Hampshire law is so\n\nclouded as to make it undesirable for a federal appeals court to\n\nspeculate   unnecessarily    in   ways    that   might   later   be   seen   as\n\npronouncements on one or another facet of the inconsistency issue.\n\n            I fully agree with my colleagues that by failing to object\n\nat the proper time to the court's relevant instructions and jury\n\nforms, and by failing to object on inconsistency grounds after the\n\nverdict was read and before the jury was dismissed, VW waived any\n\nclaim of verdict inconsistency.      See, e.g., Howard v. Antilla, 294\n\nF.3d 255, 251 (1st Cir. 2002); Bonilla v. Yamaha Motors Corp., 955\n\nF.2d 150, 155-56 (1st Cir. 1992).        And I further agree there was no\n\nplain error.    The latter is not simply a question of whether the\n\ncourt acted correctly under New Hampshire law.            Even a clear and\n\nobvious error of state law would not, by itself, amount to plain\n\nerror. The error would not be \"plain\", so as to excuse VW's failure\n\nto object, unless the error had also resulted in a miscarriage of\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fjustice.   See, e.g., United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733\n\n(1993); Chestnut v. Lowell, 305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002).   Here\n\nI can see no miscarriage of justice regardless of whether or not the\n\njury findings on defective design and negligence were inconsistent.\n\nIt is therefore entirely unnecessary for this court to suggest there\n\nwas in fact consistency, in particular because the negligence\n\nquestion submitted to the jury referenced negligent testing as well\n\nas negligent design. Reconciling the finding of no defective design\n\nwith a finding of negligent testing, on this record, is not much\n\neasier than reconciling it with a finding of negligent design.   To\n\nbe sure, New Hampshire apparently permits cases to be submitted\n\nsimultaneously on defective design and negligence theories, but this\n\ndoes not determine what should be done if the jury's results seem\n\ncontradictory in a particular case.\n\n           The overriding point here is simply that VW did not\n\npreserve the inconsistency issue.     That should end the matter.\n\nWhile the jury's logic with respect to its answers on the two counts\n\nis indeed debatable, there is no obvious injustice to entering\n\njudgment on the verdicts, as the court did.   The jury's intentions\n\nwere entirely clear - it found liability predicated on negligence,\n\nand there was ample evidence to support such a finding.    Whatever\n\nthe inconsistency of its negative finding on defective design, that\n\nfinding (if inconsistent) is most reasonably seen as the product of\n\nconfusion as to the elements of the defective design count rather\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fthan as casting doubt on the validity of the jury's resolution of\n\nthe negligence count.   There is nothing fundamentally unjust about\n\nentering judgment on both counts.      If VW wanted to argue the\n\ninconsistency issue, it needed to preserve its rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f",

This appeal arises out of\n\nan action brought in the district court arising from a collision on\n\nFebruary 19,     1991,   in    Conway,   New    Hampshire,    between      a   1986\n\nVolkswagen Vanagon and a 1979 AMC Concorde. The Vanagon was driven\n\nby David Trull.    His two sons Benjamin and Nathaniel were seated in\n\nthe rear     passenger   seat.      Benjamin     was    killed;    his   brother,\n\nNathaniel, received serious injuries.             The father, David Trull,\n\nbrought this action on behalf of Benjamin's estate and Nathaniel,\n\nwho was a minor at the time the complaint was brought.\n\n             The plaintiffs asserted claims in strict liability and\n\nnegligence     against   both     defendants-appellants           Volkswagen     of\n\nAmerica, Inc. and Volkswagen, AG (collectively \"VW\"). The evidence\n\nwas essentially the same as to both theories of liability.                      The\n\ndistrict court instructed the jury:            \"The plaintiffs have asserted\n\nstrict   product    liability     and    negligence      claims     against     the\n\ndefendant.     However, they need not prove both claims to recover.\n\nThey will be entitled to recover if they prove one or the other of\n\nthese claims.\"\n\n             Plaintiffs' claim of liability was that the 1986 Vanagon\n\nhad   been   defectively      designed   and    was    unreasonably      dangerous\n\nbecause it was not equipped with lap/shoulder belts in each of the\n\nrear seats.     The only passenger body restraints were lap belts.\n\nThe jury, in answer to specific questions, found that VW was not\n\nliable in strict liability but was liable in negligence.                         It\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fawarded Nathaniel Trull the sum of $8,917,335.27.         It awarded the\n\nestate of Benjamin Trull $1,290,980.70.\n\n           This is the second time that this case has been before\n\nus.   In the first trial VW prevailed.     The plaintiffs appealed on\n\nthe ground that the trial judge erred in putting the burden of\n\nproof as to enhancement of injuries on them.

We affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.    THE VERDICTS\n\n           There are four issues posited for review. Our discussion\n\nof the issues does not follow the order in which they are argued in\n\nVW's brief.    We start with VW's contention that the verdicts were\n\ninconsistent,    that   the   negligence   finding   of   liability   was\n\nnullified by the jury finding that VW was not liable on the claim\n\nof strict liability and therefore there should be either a judgment\n\nfor VW or a new trial.\n\n            The case was tried from the start by plaintiffs on the\n\ntheory that the 1986 Vanagon was defectively designed because it\n\nlacked lap/shoulder belts on the rear seats and this omission\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcaused the death of Benjamin Trull and seriously injured Nathaniel\n\nTrull.   In its jury instructions the district court explained\n\nseparately the elements of strict liability and negligence.      No\n\nobjection was made by VW to the verdict forms handed to the jury or\n\nthe risk of inconsistent verdicts until after the clerk had been\n\ninstructed by the court \"to enter judgment in accordance with the\n\nspecial findings of the jury\" and the jury discharged.\n\n            VW implies in its brief at page 15 that it did not have\n\nthe time to make any objections or that the district court speeded\n\nup the post-verdict process to thwart any objections.      There is\n\nnothing in the record to substantiate this implication.    Labeling\n\nthe post-verdict session a \"truncated ten-minute session\" does not\n\nchange the facts.     VW's attorneys may have been shocked by the\n\nverdict but there is nothing in the record to indicate that VW\n\nwished to object to anything.\n\n            The record shows that VW did not object to the verdict\n\nforms at any time prior to their submission to the jury.        The\n\nrecord further establishes that there were no objections to the\n\njury instructions at any time either prior to or after their\n\ndelivery.   This means that VW has waived its right to object to any\n\nforeseeable combination of proper responses to the questions posed\n\non the verdict forms.   It also means that VW was satisfied with the\n\njury instructions until the jury returned the verdicts.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          If we assume arguendo the verdicts were inconsistent, and\n\nas to this we have serious doubts, there can be no doubt that VW's\n\nfailure to follow the applicable Rule of Civil Procedure bars its\n\nappeal.   It is clear to us that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n49(b) applies to the verdict forms, not Rule 49(a) as VW asserts.\n\nRule 49(a) states:    \"The court may require a jury to return only a\n\nspecial verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each\n\nissue of fact.\"    Here, for example, a special verdict form could\n\nhave included questions such as whether the brothers were wearing\n\nlap belts at the time of the collision.   When such a form is used,\n\nthe jury makes only findings of fact; it is up to the court to\n\napply the law.    Babcock v. Gen.

There can be little\n\ndoubt that this was not the type of verdict form used in this case.\n\n          The verdict form in this case fell within the ambit of\n\nRule 49(b) which addresses general verdicts and states: \"The court\n\nmay submit to the jury, together with appropriate forms for a\n\ngeneral verdict, written interrogatories upon one or more issues of\n\nfact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict.\"\n\n          Although there were no written interrogatories submitted\n\nto the jury, it is clear that the two liability questions submitted\n\nto the jury were general verdict forms under Rule 49(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Strict Liability\n\n                 1.

We will not create\n          a general rule of prohibition in light of the\n          New Hampshire Supreme Court's reluctance to do\n          so.   We rule that it was not plain error to\n          submit counts in both negligence and strict\n          liability to the jury.\n\n          For the reasons set forth in Babcock we find there was no\n\nplain error here.\n\n          The only question on the issue of claimed inconsistent\n\nverdicts that does not admit of an easy solution is whether the\n\nverdicts were inconsistent.   The district court held that they were\n\nnot, stating:\n\n             Taking into account the New Hampshire law\n          applicable to each claim and the evidence that\n          was adduced at trial, the court finds that the\n          jury's answers to special verdict questions one\n          and three propounded in each of the plaintiffs'\n\n                                -9-\n\f           cases were not inconsistent.        The jury\n           evaluated the evidence in light of each claim\n           and answered the special verdict questions as\n           instructed.    The defendant's inconsistency\n           claim must fail on its merits.\n\n           Our review of the district court's ruling is de novo\n\nbecause this is a pure question of law.

The question on strict liability\n\nstated:\n\n           Strict Liability\n\n                  1. Do you find by a preponderance of\n           the evidence that the 1986 Vanagon was\n           defectively  designed    because    it  lacked\n           lap/shoulder  belts   in   the   rear  seating\n           positions?\n\n           The question was limited only to defective design.   The\n\nquestion on negligence, however, had more flesh to it:\n\n           Negligence\n\n                  3. Do you find by a preponderance of\n           the evidence that the defendant was negligent\n           in designing and/or testing the 1986 Vanagon\n           because it lacked lap/shoulder belts in the\n           rear seating positions? (Emphasis added.)\n\n           Under the wording of the negligence question the jury\n\ncould have found Volkswagen liable on one or more of the following\n\ngrounds:   because its design of the rear seat restraint mechanism\n\ndid not include lap/shoulder belts; there was negligent testing by\n\nVW that did not disclose that lap/shoulder belts were needed to\n\n                                -10-\n\frestrain the torso of a passenger in the rear seat from being thrown\n\nviolently    forward    in      an   accident;    or   that   VW's    negligence\n\nencompassed both design and testing.\n\n            VW has cited cases from other jurisdictions that have\n\nruled as a matter of law that verdicts based on a finding of no\n\nstrict   liability     in   a   defective     design   case   would   nullify   a\n\nliability finding of negligent design.              As we stated in Babcock,\n\nhowever,\n\n            We need not determine whether that proposition\n            is correct - it is enough to conclude, as we\n            do, that New Hampshire law is not so clear on\n            the question that it was plain error for the\n            district court to enter judgment on the jury's\n            verdict.\n\n299 F.3d at 65. It is clear that under New Hampshire tort law, both\n\nstrict liability and negligence questions can be submitted to the\n\njury.    See Thibault, 395 A.2d at 849; Greenland, 347 A.2d at 163.\n\nMoreover, as noted above, the negligence question submitted to the\n\njury referenced \"negligent           design and/or testing\" as possible\n\ngrounds for a finding of liability.\n\n            Therefore, in the context of this case, we hold that it\n\nwas not plain error for the district court to enter judgment upon\n\nverdicts indicating liability for negligence but not for strict\n\nliability.   The jury was instructed properly on the legal elements\n\nof strict liability and negligence.              The jury was also instructed\n\nthat both liability questions were to be answered.               It is obvious\n\nthat the jury understood the instructions and its duty.                It found\n\n                                       -11-\n\fno liability on strict liability and did not answer the damages part\n\nof the question.     No questions evincing confusion or ignorance were\n\nasked of the court by the jury.             It is apparent that the jury\n\nunderstood that the focus of strict liability is on whether the\n\ndesign itself is unreasonably dangerous whereas in a negligence case\n\nthe focus is on the conduct of the manufacturer, which brings us to\n\nthe next issue, the evidence of VW's negligence.\n\nII.    EVIDENCE OF NEGLIGENCE\n\n             VW claims that plaintiff failed \"to adduce sufficient\n\nevidence to establish negligence.\"          VW Br. at 17.     It first argues\n\nthat the standard of review is de novo.          This position is contrary\n\nto    the   applicable   law.   VW   filed   a   post-trial    motion   for   a\n\nremittitur or, in the alternative, for a new trial.             It also filed\n\na motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.                It is\n\nthese motions that determine the standard of review.\n\n             In reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law we must evaluate the evidence and inferences adduced\n\ntherefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.

Both parties agree that the applicable standard of care\n\nis that of a reasonably prudent automobile manufacturer.                We first\n\nnote that the front seats of the Vanagon were equipped with lap and\n\nshoulder belts.         This means that this type of body restraint was\n\nknown and available to VW. There was evidence by one of plaintiff's\n\nexperts as follows: \"There was sufficient evidence before 1986 [the\n\nyear of the Vanagon's manufacture] to show that lap belts alone just\n\ncan't do the job – to protect a person, you need a lap and shoulder\n\nbelt.\"\n\n              The results and evaluation of tests performed by VW\n\nrelative to the safety afforded rear seat passengers equipped with\n\nlap belts only, and those with both lap and shoulder belts, were\n\nexhibits in the case.         The tests were performed by VW on April 27,\n\n1981, which was five years prior to the manufacture of the Vanagon\n\nin   which    Benjamin     and     Nathaniel   Trull   were    passengers.   The\n\npertinent conclusions that VW made were as follows:\n\n                        Limited protection by lap belt\n\n                  The occupant restrained with lap belt was\n              displaced forward due to elongation of the\n\n                                        -13-\n\f          belt.   The rotational movement of the upper\n          torso about the hip point enables head contact\n          with the back rest in front of it.\n\n          1.     Evaluation regarding injury risk\n\n                 Three-point belt\n\n                 The occupant restrained with\n                 three-point   belt   is   well\n                 protected in a frontal crash.\n                 No contact with the steering\n                 wheel,    instrument    panel,\n                 transverse beam, etc. (photo 5\n                 and 6).\n\n                 Lap belt\n\n                 Lap-belt restrained vehicle occupants are\n                 subject to a high degree of head and\n                 cervical vertebrae injuries. The lap belt\n                 enables a rotational motion about the hip\n                 point. (Photo 7, 8 and 9).\n\n          There was testimony by one of plaintiffs' expert witnesses\n\n(D'Aulerio) that the use of a shoulder belt would have eliminated\n\nthe head injuries to Nathaniel and Benjamin.   The witness explained\n\nto the jury that the lap belt alone acted as a lever so that as the\n\ntorso and head were bent they were accelerated forward and inclined\n\ndownward at the moment      of   impact.   The lap belt, therefore,\n\naccording to the expert, was partially responsible for the head\n\ninjuries received by both brothers.\n\n          Another of plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Anthony Sances, had\n\na master's degree in physics and a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering.\n\nDr. Sances had considerable experience in determining the cause and\n\nextent of injuries resulting from automobile collisions; he had been\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\finvolved in over a thousand cases.    It was his opinion that there\n\nwould have been no head injuries to either Benjamin or Nathaniel if\n\nthey had been wearing shoulder belts.\n\n          We summarize other record evidence of negligence:\n\n          It was known since the 1950's in the automotive\n          industry that shoulder belts restrain forward\n          movement of occupants while lap belts do not;\n\n          It was known for a long time before 1986 that\n          lap belts alone did not offer adequate\n          protection to occupants and that lap-shoulder\n          belts were needed to do the job;\n\n          In 1980, NHTSA sent a letter to all motor\n          vehicle manufacturers, including Volkswagen in\n          which it stated, \"rear seat three-point belts\n          should be offered for additional protection to\n          rear seat occupants. They have been offered by\n          Volvo, Mercedes and a few others for many years\n          as standard equipment\";\n\n          In 1986, Volkswagen sold the Vanagon in four\n          foreign countries with rear shoulder harnesses\n          as standard equipment;\n\n          In 1986, Volkswagen sold four out of five of\n          its sedan type vehicles in the United States\n          with rear lap shoulder belts as standard\n          equipment;\n\n          Since the early 1970's, all Vanagons had anchor\n          points   which    would   have   allowed    for\n          installation of lap-shoulder belts in the rear\n          seats;\n\n          Volkswagen offered the same rear seat shoulder\n          harness as optional equipment for the 1986\n          Vanagon sold in the United States which was\n          standard equipment in other countries.\n\n          Based on our examination of the record, we have no\n\ndifficulty ruling that there was a plethora of evidence from which\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fthe jury could find that VW was negligent in not equipping the\n\nVanagon sold to plaintiff with shoulder belts on the rear passenger\n\nseats and this negligence was the proximate cause of the enhanced\n\ninjuries suffered by Nathaniel and Benjamin in the collision.\n\nIII.

From our vantage point we focus on the\n\nevidence favorable to the verdict.              See Smith, 177 F.3d at 30.\n\n             VW    claims   that   based   on     unrefuted   medical   evidence\n\nNathaniel did not suffer a brain injury in the accident.                To put it\n\nin VW's words:       \"In the crash he sustained a head injury consisting\n\nof a skull fracture and epidural hematoma without brain damage and\n\nsequelae.\"        VW Br. at 49 (emphasis in original).           But on cross-\n\nexamination, VW's expert medical witness, Dr. Mendelsohn, testified\n\nthat Nathaniel Trull did, in fact sustain a change in his condition,\n\nmaking him worse.\n\n             There was competent evidence that Nathaniel sustained a\n\ndepressed skull fracture causing blood to form inside the brain that\n\nhad to be drained away by an operation called a craniotomy.\n\n                                       -17-\n\f            There was evidence by a neuropsychologist and a clinical\n\npsychologist both of whom had treated Nathaniel before and after the\n\naccident.    The opinion of these experts was that Nathaniel's head\n\ntrauma exacerbated his pre-existing condition so that he is now\n\nunable to live independently and will have to live under supervised\n\nstructured conditions for the rest of his life.\n\n            There was evidence by a medical economist that the life\n\nexpectancy of Nathaniel was 58.1 years and that the economic loss\n\ndue to the injury was approximately $5.3 million.             As the district\n\ncourt pointed out in its order denying VW's motion for a remittitur,\n\nVW did not submit any economic evidence. The figure of $5.3 million\n\ndid not include any amount for pain and suffering or other hedonic\n\ndamages.\n\n            The jury was properly instructed that              Nathaniel was\n\nentitled to recover for past and future, pain and suffering, mental\n\nanguish and disability.\n\n            We   rule   that   the   district   court   did   not   abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion for a remittitur.\n\nIV.   THE EXCLUSION OF TEST REPORTS IN THE GERMAN LANGUAGE\n\n            This issue need not detain us long.               VW offered as\n\nexhibits test reports in the German language.            Plaintiff objected\n\nand the court informed VW that the reports would not be admitted\n\nunless they were translated into English.          This was not done.       The\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fdistrict court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the\n\ndocuments.\n\n          The judgment below is affirmed.   Costs on appeal awarded\n\nto plaintiff.\n\n\n\n                 - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f            CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.          I concur in\n\nthe judgment.    I write separately because I do not understand why\n\nmy colleagues, after finding that VW did not preserve the issue of\n\nverdict inconsistency, have gone on to discuss that issue to the\n\nextent they do, even suggesting a likely consistency between the\n\njury's two verdicts.        Whether or not the jury's responses on\n\ndefective design and negligence were inconsistent, VW's failure to\n\npreserve the inconsistency issue, and the absence of plain error,\n\nmakes the inconsistency issue irrelevant.          New Hampshire law is so\n\nclouded as to make it undesirable for a federal appeals court to\n\nspeculate   unnecessarily    in   ways    that   might   later   be   seen   as\n\npronouncements on one or another facet of the inconsistency issue.\n\n            I fully agree with my colleagues that by failing to object\n\nat the proper time to the court's relevant instructions and jury\n\nforms, and by failing to object on inconsistency grounds after the\n\nverdict was read and before the jury was dismissed, VW waived any\n\nclaim of verdict inconsistency.      See, e.g., Howard v. Antilla, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251 (1st Cir. 2002); Bonilla v.

And I further agree there was no\n\nplain error.    The latter is not simply a question of whether the\n\ncourt acted correctly under New Hampshire law.            Even a clear and\n\nobvious error of state law would not, by itself, amount to plain\n\nerror. The error would not be \"plain\", so as to excuse VW's failure\n\nto object, unless the error had also resulted in a miscarriage of\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fjustice.   See, e.g., United States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 733\n\n(1993); Chestnut v. Lowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779262\"><a href=\"/opinion/779262/craig-chestnut-v-city-of-lowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1st Cir. 2002).   Here\n\nI can see no miscarriage of justice regardless of whether or not the\n\njury findings on defective design and negligence were inconsistent.\n\nIt is therefore entirely unnecessary for this court to suggest there\n\nwas in fact consistency, in particular because the negligence\n\nquestion submitted to the jury referenced negligent testing as well\n\nas negligent design. Reconciling the finding of no defective design\n\nwith a finding of negligent testing, on this record, is not much\n\neasier than reconciling it with a finding of negligent design.   To\n\nbe sure, New Hampshire apparently permits cases to be submitted\n\nsimultaneously on defective design and negligence theories, but this\n\ndoes not determine what should be done if the jury's results seem\n\ncontradictory in a particular case.\n\n           The overriding point here is simply that VW did not\n\npreserve the inconsistency issue.     That should end the matter.\n\nWhile the jury's logic with respect to its answers on the two counts\n\nis indeed debatable, there is no obvious injustice to entering\n\njudgment on the verdicts, as the court did.   The jury's intentions\n\nwere entirely clear - it found liability predicated on negligence,\n\nand there was ample evidence to support such a finding.    Whatever\n\nthe inconsistency of its negative finding on defective design, that\n\nfinding (if inconsistent) is most reasonably seen as the product of\n\nconfusion as to the elements of the defective design count rather\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fthan as casting doubt on the validity of the jury's resolution of\n\nthe negligence count.   There is nothing fundamentally unjust about\n\nentering judgment on both counts.      If VW wanted to argue the\n\ninconsistency issue, it needed to preserve its rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f</pre>",
