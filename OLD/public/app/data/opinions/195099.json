George  Beasley appeals his\n                              \n\nconviction for possessing  heroin with intent  to distribute\n\nit, 21  U.S.C.   841(a)(1), and his  related twenty-two year\n\nprison sentence.   His most important argument  focuses upon\n\nthe  lawfulness   of  the  Sentencing   Guidelines'  \"career\n\noffender\" provision,  which increases  the guideline  prison\n\nterm for offenders with two previous  \"controlled substance\"\n\nconvictions.  U.S.S.G.    4B1.1.  In his  view, the relevant\n\nauthorizing  sentencing statute, 28 U.S.C.   994(h), permits\n\nthe  \"career offender\" guideline to take account of previous\n\nfederal drug convictions, but not of convictions under state\n       \n\ndrug laws.  Like the two other circuits that have considered\n\nthis argument, we  reject it.  United States  v. Rivera, 996\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 993 (9th  Cir. 1993); United States v.

And,  because we find  Beasley's other\n                  \n\narguments  unconvincing,  we  affirm  the  district  court's\n\njudgment.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          On January 25, 1991, a customs inspector at Newark\n\nAirport noticed what turned out  to be heroin leaking from a\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\npuncture hole in a suitcase.  She stopped the apparent owner\n\nof  the suitcase, Habib Makdessi, who, eventually, agreed to\n\nhelp agents apprehend  others involved in an  elaborate plot\n\nto  smuggle  heroin  from Beirut  to,  and  through, Boston.\n\nAgents flew  with Makdessi and  the suitcase  to Boston  and\n\nchecked  into a hotel, where,  Makdessi had told the agents,\n\nhe  would receive  further instructions.    After about  one\n\nweek, during which Makdessi had various phone  conversations\n\nrelated  to delivery of  the suitcase, Makdessi  received an\n\nauthoritative call, which agents monitored, telling him that\n\nhe should  give the heroin-filled  suitcase to a  person who\n\nwould come to  Makdessi's room, identify himself  as \"Paul,\"\n\nsay that \"Ahmed sent me,\" and give Makdessi $20,000.  During\n\nthat  conversation, Beasley knocked on the door, entered the\n\napartment, told  Makdessi that \"Ahman  sent me,\"  identified\n\nhimself as \"Paul,\" and gave Makdessi $20,000.  Makdessi gave\n\nBeasley the  suitcase, and he told Beasley that it contained\n\n\"a lot\"  of heroin.   Makdessi added  that the  suitcase had\n\nbeen punctured  and was leaking  heroin.  He gave  Beasley a\n\nshower cap filled with some  of the heroin that had spilled.\n\nBeasley  lifted the  suitcase  and  shook  it.    Government\n\nagents,  who had  monitored the  drug  delivery with  hidden\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\ncameras and  audio recorders,  arrested Beasley  as he  left\n\nwith the suitcase.  \n\n          After Beasley's  conviction, the  sentencing court\n\nturned to the  Guidelines.  It found  that Beasley possessed\n\n(with intent  to distribute)  just over  three kilograms  of\n\nheroin,  that  Beasley  had  one   previous  conviction  for\n\nviolating a federal drug law (for possessing, with intent to\n\ndistribute, about  25 grams of heroin), and that Beasley had\n\none previous conviction for violating a  state drug law (for\n\nselling about  one-half gram  of heroin).   Ordinarily,  the\n\namount of  the drug and  two prior felony  convictions would\n\nproduce a Guideline  sentencing range of  188 to 235  months\n\nimprisonment  (Offense Level  34, Criminal  History Category\n\nIII).    U.S.S.G.      2D1.1(c)(5),  4A1.1.    But,  because\n\nBeasley's  \"two  prior  felony  convictions\"  were  for   \"a\n\ncontrolled substance offense,\" the court instead applied the\n\nspecial  \"career offender\" guideline.  U.S.S.G.   4B1.1 (see\n\nappendix for the  full text).  That guideline  applies to an\n\noffender who meets its  \"career offender\" definition, which,\n\nfor  present  purposes,  includes a  person  convicted  of a\n\n\"controlled  substance offense\" who  also \"has at  least two\n\nprior felony  convictions of  . .  . a  controlled substance\n\noffense,\" which latter term \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n          means  an  offense  under a  federal  or\n                                                  \n          state law  prohibiting the  manufacture,\n               \n          import,    export,   distribution,    or\n          dispensing of a controlled substance . .\n          .  or  the  possession  of a  controlled\n          substance   .  .   .   with  intent   to\n          manufacture, import, export, distribute,\n          or dispense.\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(2) (emphasis added).\n\n          The special \"career offender\" guideline contains a\n\ntable with offense levels geared to the maximum sentence  in\n\nthe statute  of conviction.   It says that the  table \"shall\n\napply\" to a \"career offender\" if the table level is \"greater\n\nthan the offense  level otherwise applicable.\"   The \"career\n\noffender\" guideline also specifies that a \"career offender's\n\ncriminal  history category in  every case shall  be Category\n\nVI.\"\n\n          At the sentencing hearing, the parties agreed that\n\nthe drug statute  subjected Beasley to a  maximum penalty of\n\nforty  years imprisonment.   And,  the  offense level  table\n\nprovides an offense level of  34 for a career offender, who,\n\nlike Beasley, was subject to  a maximum penalty of \"25 years\n\nor more\"  (but less than  life).  Because the  ordinary drug\n\nconviction guideline  (applicable to  an offender with  just\n\nover  three kilograms of  heroin) also specifies  an offense\n\nlevel  of  34,  U.S.S.G.    2D1.1(c)(5),  the  table in  the\n\n\"career  offender\"  guideline  made  no   difference.    The\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nrequirement  that  a  \"career  offender's  criminal  history\n\ncategory\"  must  be  \"Category  VI,\"  however,  did  make  a\n\ndifference, for it increased  Beasley's guideline sentencing\n\nrange, from one of 188 to 235  months, to one of 262 to  327\n\nmonths, thereby  authorizing the  22-year sentence  that the\n\ndistrict court imposed.\n\n          Beasley,  as  we  have  said,  appeals   both  his\n\nconviction  and his  sentence.   (We  note, parenthetically,\n\nthat the drug statute, in fact, seems to subject an offender\n\nsuch as Beasley to a  maximum term of life imprisonment, not\n\nforty  years.  See 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B).  But, in light\n                  \n\nof the  government's sentencing  concession in  the district\n\ncourt, we  assume no  error in  the  point.   And, we  shall\n\nconsider  the  sentencing  aspect  of  the  appeal  on  that\n\nassumption.)\n\n                             II\n\nThe   Career  Offender   Guideline's   Prior  Drug   Offense\n                                                            \n\nDefinition\n          \n\n          Beasley's  most important  argument concedes  that\n\nthe  district court correctly applied the guidelines as they\n\nare  written.   He  claims,  however,  that  the  Sentencing\n\nCommission   lacked  the  legal  power  to  define  a  prior\n\nconviction for a  \"controlled substance offense\"  to include\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nstate,  as well as federal, convictions.  Beasley notes that\n     \n\nthe  Commission itself indicated  that it meant  its \"career\n\noffender\"  guideline   to  reflect  the  requirements  of  a\n\nparticular statutory  provision, namely 28 U.S.C.    994(h).\n\nSee U.S.S.G.    4B1.1 Background statement  (explaining that\n   \n\nthe \"career offender\" guideline meets   994(h)'s requirement\n\nthat the guidelines \"specify\" for certain \"career offenders\"\n\na \"sentence . . . at or near the maximum term authorized\" by\n\nstatute).   He  urges  us  to judge  the  lawfulness of  the\n\nguideline on  the basis of  the legal ground upon  which the\n\nCommission  explicitly (and  apparently exclusively)  rested\n\nit.   Cf.  SEC v.  Chenery  Corp., 318  U.S. 80,  87  (1943)\n                                 \n\n(reviewing agency action on the basis of the agency's actual\n\nrationale).   And, he says,  the statute's  language is  not\n\nconsistent with  the Commission's decision  to include state\n\n\"controlled substance\" convictions.\n\n          That statutory  language  says  that  an  offender\n\nshould be treated  as a  \"career offender\"  if, among  other\n\nthings, he  has \"previously  been convicted of  two or  more\n\nprior felonies, each of which is\"\n\n          (A) a crime of violence; or\n\n          (B) an offense  described in section 401\n          of  the  Controlled Substances  Act  (21\n          U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and\n          1009 of the Controlled Substances Import\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          and  Export Act  (21 U.S.C.  952(a), 955\n          and  959), and section  1 of the  Act of\n          September 15, 1980 (21 U.S.C. 955a).\n\n28  U.S.C.     994(h)(2).    Part  (B)  of  this definition,\n\ndefining  prior drug  convictions,  unlike  part (A),  lists\n\nspecific  federal statutes.   That fact, in  Beasley's view,\n\nmeans  that  Part (B)  of  the definition  does  not include\n                                                    \n\nconvictions  under state  statutes.    And,  he  says,  that\n\nexclusion makes sense, for state drug convictions,  compared\n\nwith  federal  drug convictions,  typically  involve smaller\n\namounts of drugs.\n\n          We,  like   the  other  two  circuits   that  have\n\nconsidered this question, do  not accept Beasley's argument,\n\nfor three  basic reasons.   First, although the  language of\n\nPart (B),  unlike Part (A),  does refer to  specific federal\n\nstatutes,  if one  reads its  words literally,  it  does not\n\nexclude, but rather  includes, convictions under  state law.\n                             \n\nPart (B)  refers to \"an offense described in\" the particular\n                                            \n\nspecified  federal  statutes.     Those  statutes   describe\n\nbehavior  commonly called \"drug trafficking.\"  They refer to\n\nsuch  activities   as  the  making,   importing,  exporting,\n\ndistributing, or dispensing, of drugs, and  possessing drugs\n\nwith  an intent to engage in these  activities.  They do not\n\nrefer to simple possession of drugs (except when entering or\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nleaving  the country).   A  literal  reading of  the statute\n\nwould   include  a  conviction   under  a  state   law  that\n\ncriminalizes some,  or all,  of these  same activities,  for\n\nsuch a state law would  create \"an offense described in\" the\n                                                       \n\nfederal statute.\n\n          Second,  examination   of  the   purpose  of   the\n\nstatutory  provision  supports   the  literal  reading  just\n\ndescribed.   Congress wrote that  the provision's  objective\n\nwas to ensure  that \"substantial prison terms  [are] imposed\n\non repeat  violent offenders  and repeat drug  traffickers.\"\n\nS. Rep. No. 225, 98th  Cong., 2d Sess. 175 (1984), reprinted\n                                                            \n\nin 1984  U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3358.   Beasley's interpretation\n  \n\nwould frustrate this objective, for, on that interpretation,\n\nthe  statute would not  require a \"substantial  prison term\"\n\nfor  a   \"repeat  drug  trafficker\"   apprehended  by  state\n\nauthorities and punished  under state, rather  than federal,\n\nlaw.    We  have  found   nothing  in  the  history  of  the\n\nlegislation, nor in its language, that explains why Congress\n\nwould want to insist (as  it did) upon a \"substantial prison\n\nterm\"  for an offender  who repeats earlier  violent conduct\n                                                            \n\n(irrespective of jurisdiction) but not want to insist upon a\n\nsimilar  \"substantial  prison  term\"  for  an  offender  who\n\nsimilarly repeats earlier drug trafficking conduct.\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\n          Third,  Beasley's  interpretation would  create  a\n\nsignificant anomaly  in  a  guideline  system,  the  primary\n\nobjective of  which is  to create  uniformity of  sentencing\n\ntreatment.   See Mistretta v.  United States, 488  U.S. 361,\n                                            \n\n365-66 (1989);  28 U.S.C.   991(b)(1)(B)  (guidelines should\n\n\"avoid[] unwarranted  sentence disparities  among defendants\n\nwith similar records who have  been found guilty of  similar\n\ncriminal conduct\").   In seeking  uniformity, to distinguish\n\namong  offenders  on  the basis  of  different  behavior, or\n\ndifferent  criminal  backgrounds,  often makes  sense,  when\n\nconsidered  in light  of the  basic  purposes of  punishment\n\n(e.g.,  deterrence,   \"just  deserts,\"   incapacitation,  or\n\nrehabilitation,  see 18 U.S.C.    3553(a)).   To distinguish\n                    \n\namong them  on the basis  of which jurisdiction  happened to\n                                               \n\npunish  the past criminal behavior  seems (in the absence of\n\nsome special  circumstance) close  to  irrational.   Compare\n                                                            \n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.1 Background statement (prior convictions for\n\ncriminal history purposes \"may  represent convictions in the\n\nfederal  system,  fifty  state   systems,  the  District  of\n\nColumbia,  territories, and  foreign,  tribal, and  military\n\ncourts\").\n\n          Beasley argues,  to the contrary,  that state drug\n\ntrafficking  convictions often  involve  smaller amounts  of\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ndrugs.  We do not know the extent to which that is so.  But,\n\nin  any event,  Congress does  not  normally key  recidivism\n                                                            \n\npunishments  to the  amount of  drugs  involved in  earlier,\n\npredicate convictions.   See, e.g.,  28 U.S.C.    994(h); 21\n                                  \n\nU.S.C.   841(b).  And,  to read this statute as representing\n\nan effort to  do so seems  at least as  likely to produce  a\n\ncrazy-quilt of  punishment  results, as  to connect  similar\n\npunishments rationally to similar past behavior.\n\n          Beasley's strongest argument is  that Congress, in\n\nother  statutes, has written the term \"state law\" explicitly\n\nwhen it has  wanted to include convictions  under state law.\n\nSee, e.g., 28 U.S.C.   994(i); 21 U.S.C.   841(b); 18 U.S.C.\n         \n\n   924(e).   In fact,  until  Congress amended  21 U.S.C.   \n\n841(b) specifically to allow sentence enhancements  based on\n\nprior  state law drug convictions,  courts had held that the\n\nstatute did not apply to those state drug convictions.  See,\n                                                           \n\ne.g.,   United States  v.

Johnson, 506 F.2d  305, 307 (7th Cir. 1974), cert.\n                                                            \n\ndenied, 420 U.S. 1005 (1975).  However, the language used in\n      \n\nthe  earlier version  of     841(b)  is different  from  the\n\n\"described  in\" language  of     994(h).   See  21 U.S.C.   \n                                              \n\n841(b)(1)(A)  (referring to \"prior convictions .  . . for an\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\noffense punishable under  . . . any  . . . other  law of the\n\nUnited  States   relating   to   narcotic   drugs\"   (before\n\namendment)).  Furthermore, the legislative history of former\n\n  841(b)(1)(A),  unlike the legislative history  here, makes\n\nclear that  Congress intended that enhancement  provision to\n\napply only  to a prior  federal conviction.  See  Gates, 807\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at  1082.   Congress  can  embody a  similar  scope-of-\n\ncoverage intent in different ways in different statutes.\n\n          The  upshot is that the statute's purpose, and the\n\npurpose of  the sentencing laws  of which that statute  is a\n\npart, both  support the  Commission's interpretation  of the\n\nstatute.  The language of the statute, when read  literally,\n\nfavors that same  conclusion.  We find the  arguments to the\n\ncontrary  plausible,  but  ultimately  not  convincing.   We\n\ntherefore conclude that  the statutory provision  authorizes\n\nthe Commission to define \"career  offender\" as it has  done,\n\nthat is, to include  those with prior state law  convictions\n\nfor  offenses  of the  sort  defined in  the  listed federal\n\nstatutes.\n\n                            III\n\n                      Other Arguments\n                                     \n\n          1.  The Amount of  Heroin.  Beasley  was sentenced\n                                   \n\nunder the  belief  that  the  applicable  offense  statutory\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nmaximum  was 40 years,  and thus, under  the career offender\n\nguideline,  offense level 34  applied.  Beasley  argues that\n\nthe  court applied the  wrong statutory maximum  because the\n\nprovision  it  used,    841(b)(1)(B),  applies  only  if the\n\nviolation involved  100 grams  or more of  heroin.   And, he\n\nsays that the  evidence did not support the district court's\n\nfinding  that  he  knew  about the  3  kilograms  of heroin.\n\nRather, he  says that the  evidence shows that he  only knew\n\nabout 5 grams of heroin.  However,  even if it were relevant\n                                                            \n\nfor sentencing purposes that  Beasley believed the  suitcase\n\ncontained only five grams of  heroin, the same offense level\n\nwould apply.  See 21 U.S.C.   841(b)(1)(C) (30 years maximum\n                 \n\nsentence if repeat offender and violation involved less than\n\n100  grams of heroin); U.S.S.G.   4B1.1(b) (specifying level\n\n34 if statutory maximum for offense exceeds 25 years).\n\n          Regardless, the evidence  was more than sufficient\n\nto  support  the  district court's  factual  conclusion that\n\nBeasley knew the suitcase contained about three kilograms of\n\nheroin.   The  complex nature  of  the crime,  the elaborate\n\ndelivery precautions, the  suitcase that  in fact  contained\n\nmore than three kilograms of heroin, the fact that  Makdessi\n\ntold him  the suitcase contained  a lot of heroin,  the fact\n\nthat heroin  had leaked  out and was  contained in  a shower\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\ncap, and his having lifted and shaken the suitcase, together\n\nprovide  more than  enough  support for  a  finding that  he\n\nactually  knew   the  transaction  involved  more  than  one\n\nkilogram.  The only contrary  evidence lies in the fact that\n\nhe paid only  $20,000, far less than the  wholesale value of\n\none kilogram.  Yet, nothing  in the record suggests that the\n\n$20,000 sum  was meant  to be more  than a  partial payment.\n\nThus, this fact  does not lead us to  a contrary conclusion.\n\nBecause  the record supports  a finding of  actual knowledge\n\n(and because any  error was harmless), we need  not consider\n\nother mental  states and  other circumstances.   Cf.  United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v. Ekwunoh,  813 F. Supp.  168, 179  (E.D.N.Y. 1993)\n                  \n\n(holding that, in  some circumstances,  defendant cannot  be\n\nsentenced  for  possessing  more  drugs  than he  reasonably\n\nbelieved he possessed).\n\n          2.  Ineffective Assistance  of  Counsel.   Beasley\n                                                 \n\nsays that his counsel was \"ineffective\" in failing to attack\n\nthe  \"chain of  custody\"  receipts  for  the  heroin,  which\n\nattack, in his view, represented his only hope of acquittal.\n\nThe record  before us  provides no  basis for  accepting his\n\n\"ineffective assistance\" claim.   The government  introduced\n\nwhat  seems to  be strong  evidence of  custody.   The trial\n\ncourt, as a  general matter, praised  counsel's performance.\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nWe  do   not  normally  consider   claims  of   \"ineffective\n\nassistance\" on direct appeal, for  such claims may require a\n\ncourt  to go  outside  the  trial  record, for  example,  to\n\nconsider counsel's trial  strategy.  United States  v. Mala,\n                                                           \n\nNo. 91-2229, slip  op. at 9-10 (1st Cir. Oct. 27, 1993).  We\n\nsee no reason  for making an exception to that  rule in this\n\ncase.\n\n          3.  Waiver of Counsel.  In mid-trial Beasley asked\n                               \n\nthe trial court  to permit him to discharge  his counsel and\n\nproceed on  his own.   The trial judge warned  Beasley about\n\nthe dangers  of doing so.   But, when Beasley  persisted, he\n\ngranted Beasley's request, having asked counsel to remain to\n\nadvise Beasley  if necessary.   Beasley now argues  that the\n\n\"totality  of the circumstances\"  establish that Beasley did\n\nnot \"knowingly and intelligently\" waive his Sixth  Amendment\n\nright to counsel.  See Farretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806,\n                                             \n\n835 (1975); United States v.  Hafen, 726 F.2d 21, 24-26 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir.),  cert.  denied,  466  U.S.  962  (1984);  Maynard  v.\n                                                        \n\nMeachum, 545 F.2d 273, 277-79 (1st Cir. 1976).  He says that\n       \n\nthe record does not make  it sufficiently clear that he \"was\n\naware   of   the   dangers   and   disadvantages   of   self\n\nrepresentation, the technical requirements of trial, and the\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\npotential  penalties he  was  facing.\"   Appellant's Opening\n\nBrief at 29; see Maynard, 545 F.2d at 279.\n                        \n\n          Having reviewed the  record, we do not  agree with\n\nBeasley's conclusions.  The district court clearly explained\n\nthe disadvantages of his choice and the technical  nature of\n\nthe trial.   The  judge discussed in  detail the  calling of\n\nwitnesses,  the presentation of  closing arguments,  and the\n\nneed  to review  jury  instructions,  all  to  help  Beasley\n\nunderstand   the  magnitude  of  what  he  proposed  to  do.\n\nMoreover,  Beasley's past  record  --  his  two  prior  drug\n\nconvictions  -- suggest  some familiarity  with the  serious\n\nnature   of   trials  and   their   potential  technicality.\n\nSimilarly, the fact  that Beasley had previously  received a\n\nfive-year sentence  for  violating the  same statute,  along\n\nwith the  notice of  enhanced sentence  that the  government\n\nsent   to  Beasley  and  the  detention  hearing  where  the\n\ngovernment told Beasley  he faced a possible  life sentence,\n\nall  indicate  that  Beasley  was  aware  of  the  potential\n\npenalties   he  was  facing.    Beasley  now  says  that  he\n\nerroneously thought  he would  not be  permitted to  testify\n\nunless he  dismissed his lawyer, but the  record provides no\n\nbasis  for  the  district  court's  having  believed Beasley\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nentertained that  thought nor  any objective  basis for  his\n\nhaving done so.\n\n          Despite the  court's explanation  of disadvantages\n\nof self-representation and the  technicalities of the trial,\n\nBeasley insisted, quite clearly, that he wanted to represent\n\nhimself.  The trial court, therefore, properly permitted him\n\nto  do so  and wisely asked  his counsel  to stay  and offer\n\nadvice if necessary.  We find no error.\n\n          4.  Reasonable Doubt.  Beasley argues that the law\n                              \n\nrequired the district  court to define the  term \"reasonable\n\ndoubt\" in its  jury instructions.  The  court, however, gave\n\nthe type  of instruction that this court  approved in United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v. Olmstead,  832 F.2d  642 (1st  Cir. 1987),  cert.\n                                                            \n\ndenied, 486  U.S. 1009 (1988).   We  have held that  the law\n      \n\ndoes  not  require  a  further,  more  detailed explanation.\n\nUnited States  v.  Campbell, 874  F.2d  838, 843  (1st  Cir.\n                           \n\n1989); Olmstead, 832 F.2d at 646.\n               \n\n          For these  reasons, the  judgment of  the district\n\ncourt is\n\n          Affirmed. \n                   \n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\nNote:  See slip opinion for copy of Appendix.\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n",

Sec. 841(a)(1), and his related twenty-two year prison sentence.  His most important argument focuses upon the lawfulness of the Sentencing Guidelines' \"career offender\" provision, which increases the guideline prison term for offenders with two previous \"controlled substance\" convictions.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1.  In his view, the relevant authorizing sentencing statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(h), permits the \"career offender\" guideline to take account of previous federal drug convictions, but not of convictions under state drug laws.  Like the two other circuits that have considered this argument, we reject it.  United States v. Rivera, 996 F.2d 993 (9th Cir.1993);  United States v. Whyte, 892 F.2d 1170 (3d Cir.1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1070, 110 S.Ct. 1793, 108 L.Ed.2d 794 (1990);  see also United States v. Dyer, 9 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam ).  And, because we find Beasley's other arguments unconvincing, we affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 1991, a customs inspector at Newark Airport noticed what turned out to be heroin leaking from a puncture hole in a suitcase.  She stopped the apparent owner of the suitcase, Habib Makdessi, who, eventually, agreed to help agents apprehend others involved in an elaborate plot to smuggle heroin from Beirut to, and through, Boston.  Agents flew with Makdessi and the suitcase to Boston and checked into a hotel, where, Makdessi had told the agents, he would receive further instructions.  After about one week, during which Makdessi had various phone conversations related to delivery of the suitcase, Makdessi received an authoritative call, which agents monitored, telling him that he should give the heroin-filled suitcase to a person who would come to Makdessi's room, identify himself as \"Paul,\" say that \"Ahmed sent me,\" and give Makdessi $20,000.  During that conversation, Beasley knocked on the door, entered the apartment, told Makdessi that \"Ahman sent me,\" identified himself as \"Paul,\" and gave Makdessi $20,000.  Makdessi gave Beasley the suitcase, and he told Beasley that it contained \"a lot\" of heroin.  Makdessi added that the suitcase had been punctured and was leaking heroin.  He gave Beasley a shower cap filled with some of the heroin that had spilled. Beasley lifted the suitcase and shook it.  Government agents, who had monitored the drug delivery with hidden cameras and audio recorders, arrested Beasley as he left with the suitcase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Beasley's conviction, the sentencing court turned to the Guidelines.  It found that Beasley possessed (with intent to distribute) just over three kilograms of heroin, that Beasley had one previous conviction for violating a federal drug law (for possessing, with intent to distribute, about 25 grams of heroin), and that Beasley had one previous conviction for violating a state drug law (for selling about one-half gram of heroin).  Ordinarily, the amount of the drug and two prior felony convictions would produce a Guideline sentencing range of 188 to 235 months imprisonment (Offense Level 34, Criminal History Category III).  U.S.S.G. Secs. 2D1.1(c)(5), 4A1.1.  But, because Beasley's \"two prior felony convictions\" were for \"a controlled substance offense,\" the court instead applied the special \"career offender\" guideline.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1 (see appendix for the full text).  That guideline applies to an offender who meets its \"career offender\" definition, which, for present purposes, includes a person convicted of a \"controlled substance offense\" who also \"has at least two prior felony convictions of ... a controlled substance offense,\" which latter term</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>means an offense under a federal or state law prohibiting the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The special \"career offender\" guideline contains a table with offense levels geared to the maximum sentence in the statute of conviction.  It says that the table \"shall apply\" to a \"career offender\" if the table level is \"greater than the offense level otherwise applicable.\"   The \"career offender\" guideline also specifies that a \"career offender's criminal history category in every case shall be Category VI.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the parties agreed that the drug statute subjected Beasley to a maximum penalty of forty years imprisonment.  And, the offense level table provides an offense level of 34 for a career offender, who, like Beasley, was subject to a maximum penalty of \"25 years or more\" (but less than life).  Because the ordinary drug conviction guideline (applicable to an offender with just over three kilograms of heroin) also specifies an offense level of 34, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(5), the table in the \"career offender\" guideline made no difference.  The requirement that a \"career offender's criminal history category\" must be \"Category VI,\" however, did make a difference, for it increased Beasley's guideline sentencing range, from one of 188 to 235 months, to one of 262 to 327 months, thereby authorizing the 22-year sentence that the district court imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beasley, as we have said, appeals both his conviction and his sentence.  (We note, parenthetically, that the drug statute, in fact, seems to subject an offender such as Beasley to a maximum term of life imprisonment, not forty years.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B).  But, in light of the government's sentencing concession in the district court, we assume no error in the point.  And, we shall consider the sentencing aspect of the appeal on that assumption.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The Career Offender Guideline's Prior Drug Offense</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Definition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beasley's most important argument concedes that the district court correctly applied the guidelines as they are written.  He claims, however, that the Sentencing Commission lacked the legal power to define a prior conviction for a \"controlled substance offense\" to include state, as well as federal, convictions.  Beasley notes that the Commission itself indicated that it meant its \"career offender\" guideline to reflect the requirements of a particular statutory provision, namely 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(h).  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1 Background statement (explaining that the \"career offender\" guideline meets Sec. 994(h)'s requirement that the guidelines \"specify\" for certain \"career offenders\" a \"sentence ... at or near the maximum term authorized\" by statute).  He urges us to judge the lawfulness of the guideline on the basis of the legal ground upon which the Commission explicitly (and apparently exclusively) rested it.  Cf. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) (reviewing agency action on the basis of the agency's actual rationale).  And, he says, the statute's language is not consistent with the Commission's decision to include state \"controlled substance\" convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That statutory language says that an offender should be treated as a \"career offender\" if, among other things, he has \"previously been convicted of two or more prior felonies, each of which is\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>(A) a crime of violence;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(B) an offense described in section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and 1009 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a), 955 and 959), and section 1 of the Act of September 15, 1980 (21 U.S.C. 955a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(h)(2).  Part (B) of this definition, defining prior drug convictions, unlike part (A), lists specific federal statutes.  That fact, in Beasley's view, means that Part (B) of the definition does not include convictions under state statutes.  And, he says, that exclusion makes sense, for state drug convictions, compared with federal drug convictions, typically involve smaller amounts of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, like the other two circuits that have considered this question, do not accept Beasley's argument, for three basic reasons.  First, although the language of Part (B), unlike Part (A), does refer to specific federal statutes, if one reads its words literally, it does not exclude, but rather includes, convictions under state law.  Part (B) refers to \"an offense described in \" the particular specified federal statutes.  Those statutes describe behavior commonly called \"drug trafficking.\"   They refer to such activities as the making, importing, exporting, distributing, or dispensing, of drugs, and possessing drugs with an intent to engage in these activities.  They do not refer to simple possession of drugs (except when entering or leaving the country).  A literal reading of the statute would include a conviction under a state law that criminalizes some, or all, of these same activities, for such a state law would create \"an offense described in \" the federal statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, examination of the purpose of the statutory provision supports the literal reading just described.  Congress wrote that the provision's objective was to ensure that \"substantial prison terms [are] imposed on repeat violent offenders and repeat drug traffickers.\"   S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 175 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3358.  Beasley's interpretation would frustrate this objective, for, on that interpretation, the statute would not require a \"substantial prison term\" for a \"repeat drug trafficker\" apprehended by state authorities and punished under state, rather than federal, law.  We have found nothing in the history of the legislation, nor in its language, that explains why Congress would want to insist (as it did) upon a \"substantial prison term\" for an offender who repeats earlier violent conduct (irrespective of jurisdiction) but not want to insist upon a similar \"substantial prison term\" for an offender who similarly repeats earlier drug trafficking conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Beasley's interpretation would create a significant anomaly in a guideline system, the primary objective of which is to create uniformity of sentencing treatment.  See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 365-66, 109 S.Ct. 647, 651-52, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989);  28 U.S.C. Sec. 991(b)(1)(B) (guidelines should \"avoid[ ] unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct\").  In seeking uniformity, to distinguish among offenders on the basis of different behavior, or different criminal backgrounds, often makes sense, when considered in light of the basic purposes of punishment (e.g., deterrence, \"just deserts,\" incapacitation, or rehabilitation, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)).  To distinguish among them on the basis of which jurisdiction happened to punish the past criminal behavior seems (in the absence of some special circumstance) close to irrational.  Compare U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1 Background statement (prior convictions for criminal history purposes \"may represent convictions in the federal system, fifty state systems, the District of Columbia, territories, and foreign, tribal, and military courts\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beasley argues, to the contrary, that state drug trafficking convictions often involve smaller amounts of drugs.  We do not know the extent to which that is so.  But, in any event, Congress does not normally key recidivism punishments to the amount of drugs involved in earlier, predicate convictions.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(h);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b).  And, to read this statute as representing an effort to do so seems at least as likely to produce a crazy-quilt of punishment results, as to connect similar punishments rationally to similar past behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beasley's strongest argument is that Congress, in other statutes, has written the term \"state law\" explicitly when it has wanted to include convictions under state law.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(i);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b);  18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e).  In fact, until Congress amended 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b) specifically to allow sentence enhancements based on prior state law drug convictions, courts had held that the statute did not apply to those state drug convictions.  See, e.g., United States v. Gates, 807 F.2d 1075, 1082 (D.C.Cir.1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1006, 107 S.Ct. 1631, 95 L.Ed.2d 204 (1987);  United States v. Johnson, 506 F.2d 305, 307 (7th Cir.1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 1005, 95 S.Ct. 1448, 43 L.Ed.2d 763 (1975).  However, the language used in the earlier version of Sec. 841(b) is different from the \"described in\" language of Sec. 994(h).  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(A) (referring to \"prior convictions ... for an offense punishable under ... any ... other law of the United States relating to narcotic drugs\" (before amendment)).  Furthermore, the legislative history of former Sec. 841(b)(1)(A), unlike the legislative history here, makes clear that Congress intended that enhancement provision to apply only to a prior federal conviction.  See Gates, 807 F.2d at 1082.   Congress can embody a similar scope-of-coverage intent in different ways in different statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot is that the statute's purpose, and the purpose of the sentencing laws of which that statute is a part, both support the Commission's interpretation of the statute.  The language of the statute, when read literally, favors that same conclusion.  We find the arguments to the contrary plausible, but ultimately not convincing.  We therefore conclude that the statutory provision authorizes the Commission to define \"career offender\" as it has done, that is, to include those with prior state law convictions for offenses of the sort defined in the listed federal statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Other Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The Amount of Heroin.   Beasley was sentenced under the belief that the applicable offense statutory maximum was 40 years, and thus, under the career offender guideline, offense level 34 applied.  Beasley argues that the court applied the wrong statutory maximum because the provision it used, Sec. 841(b)(1)(B), applies only if the violation involved 100 grams or more of heroin.  And, he says that the evidence did not support the district court's finding that he knew about the 3 kilograms of heroin.  Rather, he says that the evidence shows that he only knew about 5 grams of heroin.  However, even if it were relevant for sentencing purposes that Beasley believed the suitcase contained only five grams of heroin, the same offense level would apply.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(C) (30 years maximum sentence if repeat offender and violation involved less than 100 grams of heroin);  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1(B) (specifying level 34 if statutory maximum for offense exceeds 25 years).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless, the evidence was more than sufficient to support the district court's factual conclusion that Beasley knew the suitcase contained about three kilograms of heroin.  The complex nature of the crime, the elaborate delivery precautions, the suitcase that in fact contained more than three kilograms of heroin, the fact that Makdessi told him the suitcase contained a lot of heroin, the fact that heroin had leaked out and was contained in a shower cap, and his having lifted and shaken the suitcase, together provide more than enough support for a finding that he actually knew the transaction involved more than one kilogram.  The only contrary evidence lies in the fact that he paid only $20,000, far less than the wholesale value of one kilogram.  Yet, nothing in the record suggests that the $20,000 sum was meant to be more than a partial payment.  Thus, this fact does not lead us to a contrary conclusion.  Because the record supports a finding of actual knowledge (and because any error was harmless), we need not consider other mental states and other circumstances.  Cf. United States v. Ekwunoh, 813 F.Supp. 168, 179 (E.D.N.Y.1993) (holding that, in some circumstances, defendant cannot be sentenced for possessing more drugs than he reasonably believed he possessed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.   Beasley says that his counsel was \"ineffective\" in failing to attack the \"chain of custody\" receipts for the heroin, which attack, in his view, represented his only hope of acquittal.  The record before us provides no basis for accepting his \"ineffective assistance\" claim.  The government introduced what seems to be strong evidence of custody.  The trial court, as a general matter, praised counsel's performance.  We do not normally consider claims of \"ineffective assistance\" on direct appeal, for such claims may require a court to go outside the trial record, for example, to consider counsel's trial strategy.  United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1062-63 (1st Cir.1993).  We see no reason for making an exception to that rule in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  Waiver of Counsel.   In mid-trial Beasley asked the trial court to permit him to discharge his counsel and proceed on his own.  The trial judge warned Beasley about the dangers of doing so.  But, when Beasley persisted, he granted Beasley's request, having asked counsel to remain to advise Beasley if necessary.  Beasley now argues that the \"totality of the circumstances\" establish that Beasley did not \"knowingly and intelligently\" waive his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975);  United States v. Hafen, 726 F.2d 21, 24-26 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 962, 104 S.Ct. 2179, 80 L.Ed.2d 561 (1984);  Maynard v. Meachum, 545 F.2d 273, 277-79 (1st Cir.1976).  He says that the record does not make it sufficiently clear that he \"was aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self representation, the technical requirements of trial, and the potential penalties he was facing.\"   Appellant's Opening Brief at 29;  see Maynard, 545 F.2d at 279.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the record, we do not agree with Beasley's conclusions.  The district court clearly explained the disadvantages of his choice and the technical nature of the trial.  The judge discussed in detail the calling of witnesses, the presentation of closing arguments, and the need to review jury instructions, all to help Beasley understand the magnitude of what he proposed to do.  Moreover, Beasley's past record--his two prior drug convictions--suggest some familiarity with the serious nature of trials and their potential technicality.  Similarly, the fact that Beasley had previously received a five-year sentence for violating the same statute, along with the notice of enhanced sentence that the government sent to Beasley and the detention hearing where the government told Beasley he faced a possible life sentence, all indicate that Beasley was aware of the potential penalties he was facing.  Beasley now says that he erroneously thought he would not be permitted to testify unless he dismissed his lawyer, but the record provides no basis for the district court's having believed Beasley entertained that thought nor any objective basis for his having done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the court's explanation of disadvantages of self-representation and the technicalities of the trial, Beasley insisted, quite clearly, that he wanted to represent himself.  The trial court, therefore, properly permitted him to do so and wisely asked his counsel to stay and offer advice if necessary.  We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Reasonable Doubt.   Beasley argues that the law required the district court to define the term \"reasonable doubt\" in its jury instructions.  The court, however, gave the type of instruction that this court approved in United States v. Olmstead, 832 F.2d 642 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1009, 108 S.Ct. 1739, 100 L.Ed.2d 202 (1988).  We have held that the law does not require a further, more detailed explanation.  United States v. Campbell, 874 F.2d 838, 843 (1st Cir.1989);  Olmstead, 832 F.2d at 646.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>PART B--CAREER OFFENDERS AND CRIMINAL LIVELIHOOD</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sec. 4B1.1 Career Offender</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time of the instant offense, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.

Sec. 841(a)(1), and his related twenty-two year prison sentence.  His most important argument focuses upon the lawfulness of the Sentencing Guidelines' \"career offender\" provision, which increases the guideline prison term for offenders with two previous \"controlled substance\" convictions.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1.  In his view, the relevant authorizing sentencing statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(h), permits the \"career offender\" guideline to take account of previous federal drug convictions, but not of convictions under state drug laws.  Like the two other circuits that have considered this argument, we reject it.  United States v.

And, because we find Beasley's other arguments unconvincing, we affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 1991, a customs inspector at Newark Airport noticed what turned out to be heroin leaking from a puncture hole in a suitcase.  She stopped the apparent owner of the suitcase, Habib Makdessi, who, eventually, agreed to help agents apprehend others involved in an elaborate plot to smuggle heroin from Beirut to, and through, Boston.  Agents flew with Makdessi and the suitcase to Boston and checked into a hotel, where, Makdessi had told the agents, he would receive further instructions.  After about one week, during which Makdessi had various phone conversations related to delivery of the suitcase, Makdessi received an authoritative call, which agents monitored, telling him that he should give the heroin-filled suitcase to a person who would come to Makdessi's room, identify himself as \"Paul,\" say that \"Ahmed sent me,\" and give Makdessi $20,000.  During that conversation, Beasley knocked on the door, entered the apartment, told Makdessi that \"Ahman sent me,\" identified himself as \"Paul,\" and gave Makdessi $20,000.  Makdessi gave Beasley the suitcase, and he told Beasley that it contained \"a lot\" of heroin.  Makdessi added that the suitcase had been punctured and was leaking heroin.  He gave Beasley a shower cap filled with some of the heroin that had spilled. Beasley lifted the suitcase and shook it.  Government agents, who had monitored the drug delivery with hidden cameras and audio recorders, arrested Beasley as he left with the suitcase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Beasley's conviction, the sentencing court turned to the Guidelines.  It found that Beasley possessed (with intent to distribute) just over three kilograms of heroin, that Beasley had one previous conviction for violating a federal drug law (for possessing, with intent to distribute, about 25 grams of heroin), and that Beasley had one previous conviction for violating a state drug law (for selling about one-half gram of heroin).  Ordinarily, the amount of the drug and two prior felony convictions would produce a Guideline sentencing range of 188 to 235 months imprisonment (Offense Level 34, Criminal History Category III).  U.S.S.G. Secs. 2D1.1(c)(5), 4A1.1.  But, because Beasley's \"two prior felony convictions\" were for \"a controlled substance offense,\" the court instead applied the special \"career offender\" guideline.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1 (see appendix for the full text).  That guideline applies to an offender who meets its \"career offender\" definition, which, for present purposes, includes a person convicted of a \"controlled substance offense\" who also \"has at least two prior felony convictions of ... a controlled substance offense,\" which latter term</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>means an offense under a federal or state law prohibiting the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The special \"career offender\" guideline contains a table with offense levels geared to the maximum sentence in the statute of conviction.  It says that the table \"shall apply\" to a \"career offender\" if the table level is \"greater than the offense level otherwise applicable.\"   The \"career offender\" guideline also specifies that a \"career offender's criminal history category in every case shall be Category VI.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the parties agreed that the drug statute subjected Beasley to a maximum penalty of forty years imprisonment.  And, the offense level table provides an offense level of 34 for a career offender, who, like Beasley, was subject to a maximum penalty of \"25 years or more\" (but less than life).  Because the ordinary drug conviction guideline (applicable to an offender with just over three kilograms of heroin) also specifies an offense level of 34, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(5), the table in the \"career offender\" guideline made no difference.  The requirement that a \"career offender's criminal history category\" must be \"Category VI,\" however, did make a difference, for it increased Beasley's guideline sentencing range, from one of 188 to 235 months, to one of 262 to 327 months, thereby authorizing the 22-year sentence that the district court imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beasley, as we have said, appeals both his conviction and his sentence.  (We note, parenthetically, that the drug statute, in fact, seems to subject an offender such as Beasley to a maximum term of life imprisonment, not forty years.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B).  But, in light of the government's sentencing concession in the district court, we assume no error in the point.  And, we shall consider the sentencing aspect of the appeal on that assumption.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The Career Offender Guideline's Prior Drug Offense</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Definition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beasley's most important argument concedes that the district court correctly applied the guidelines as they are written.  He claims, however, that the Sentencing Commission lacked the legal power to define a prior conviction for a \"controlled substance offense\" to include state, as well as federal, convictions.  Beasley notes that the Commission itself indicated that it meant its \"career offender\" guideline to reflect the requirements of a particular statutory provision, namely 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(h).  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1 Background statement (explaining that the \"career offender\" guideline meets Sec. 994(h)'s requirement that the guidelines \"specify\" for certain \"career offenders\" a \"sentence ... at or near the maximum term authorized\" by statute).  He urges us to judge the lawfulness of the guideline on the basis of the legal ground upon which the Commission explicitly (and apparently exclusively) rested it.  Cf. SEC v. Chenery Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103770\"><a href=\"/opinion/103770/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 87, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></span> (1943) (reviewing agency action on the basis of the agency's actual rationale).  And, he says, the statute's language is not consistent with the Commission's decision to include state \"controlled substance\" convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That statutory language says that an offender should be treated as a \"career offender\" if, among other things, he has \"previously been convicted of two or more prior felonies, each of which is\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>(A) a crime of violence;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(B) an offense described in section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and 1009 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a), 955 and 959), and section 1 of the Act of September 15, 1980 (21 U.S.C. 955a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(h)(2).  Part (B) of this definition, defining prior drug convictions, unlike part (A), lists specific federal statutes.  That fact, in Beasley's view, means that Part (B) of the definition does not include convictions under state statutes.  And, he says, that exclusion makes sense, for state drug convictions, compared with federal drug convictions, typically involve smaller amounts of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, like the other two circuits that have considered this question, do not accept Beasley's argument, for three basic reasons.  First, although the language of Part (B), unlike Part (A), does refer to specific federal statutes, if one reads its words literally, it does not exclude, but rather includes, convictions under state law.  Part (B) refers to \"an offense described in \" the particular specified federal statutes.  Those statutes describe behavior commonly called \"drug trafficking.\"   They refer to such activities as the making, importing, exporting, distributing, or dispensing, of drugs, and possessing drugs with an intent to engage in these activities.  They do not refer to simple possession of drugs (except when entering or leaving the country).  A literal reading of the statute would include a conviction under a state law that criminalizes some, or all, of these same activities, for such a state law would create \"an offense described in \" the federal statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, examination of the purpose of the statutory provision supports the literal reading just described.  Congress wrote that the provision's objective was to ensure that \"substantial prison terms [are] imposed on repeat violent offenders and repeat drug traffickers.\"   S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 175 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3358.  Beasley's interpretation would frustrate this objective, for, on that interpretation, the statute would not require a \"substantial prison term\" for a \"repeat drug trafficker\" apprehended by state authorities and punished under state, rather than federal, law.  We have found nothing in the history of the legislation, nor in its language, that explains why Congress would want to insist (as it did) upon a \"substantial prison term\" for an offender who repeats earlier violent conduct (irrespective of jurisdiction) but not want to insist upon a similar \"substantial prison term\" for an offender who similarly repeats earlier drug trafficking conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Beasley's interpretation would create a significant anomaly in a guideline system, the primary objective of which is to create uniformity of sentencing treatment.  See Mistretta v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112173\"><a href=\"/opinion/112173/mistretta-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 365-66, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112173\"><a href=\"/opinion/112173/mistretta-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span>, 651-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112173\"><a href=\"/opinion/112173/mistretta-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span> (1989);  28 U.S.C. Sec. 991(b)(1)(B) (guidelines should \"avoid[ ] unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct\").  In seeking uniformity, to distinguish among offenders on the basis of different behavior, or different criminal backgrounds, often makes sense, when considered in light of the basic purposes of punishment (e.g., deterrence, \"just deserts,\" incapacitation, or rehabilitation, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)).  To distinguish among them on the basis of which jurisdiction happened to punish the past criminal behavior seems (in the absence of some special circumstance) close to irrational.  Compare U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1 Background statement (prior convictions for criminal history purposes \"may represent convictions in the federal system, fifty state systems, the District of Columbia, territories, and foreign, tribal, and military courts\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beasley argues, to the contrary, that state drug trafficking convictions often involve smaller amounts of drugs.  We do not know the extent to which that is so.  But, in any event, Congress does not normally key recidivism punishments to the amount of drugs involved in earlier, predicate convictions.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(h);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b).  And, to read this statute as representing an effort to do so seems at least as likely to produce a crazy-quilt of punishment results, as to connect similar punishments rationally to similar past behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beasley's strongest argument is that Congress, in other statutes, has written the term \"state law\" explicitly when it has wanted to include convictions under state law.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(i);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b);  18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e).  In fact, until Congress amended 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b) specifically to allow sentence enhancements based on prior state law drug convictions, courts had held that the statute did not apply to those state drug convictions.  See, e.g., United States v. Gates, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480731\"><a href=\"/opinion/480731/united-states-v-george-d-gates-united-states-of-america-v-daniel-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span>, 1082 (D.C.Cir.1986), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></span> (1975).  However, the language used in the earlier version of Sec. 841(b) is different from the \"described in\" language of Sec. 994(h).  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(A) (referring to \"prior convictions ... for an offense punishable under ... any ... other law of the United States relating to narcotic drugs\" (before amendment)).  Furthermore, the legislative history of former Sec. 841(b)(1)(A), unlike the legislative history here, makes clear that Congress intended that enhancement provision to apply only to a prior federal conviction.  See Gates, 807 F.2d at 1082.   Congress can embody a similar scope-of-coverage intent in different ways in different statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot is that the statute's purpose, and the purpose of the sentencing laws of which that statute is a part, both support the Commission's interpretation of the statute.  The language of the statute, when read literally, favors that same conclusion.  We find the arguments to the contrary plausible, but ultimately not convincing.  We therefore conclude that the statutory provision authorizes the Commission to define \"career offender\" as it has done, that is, to include those with prior state law convictions for offenses of the sort defined in the listed federal statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Other Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The Amount of Heroin.   Beasley was sentenced under the belief that the applicable offense statutory maximum was 40 years, and thus, under the career offender guideline, offense level 34 applied.  Beasley argues that the court applied the wrong statutory maximum because the provision it used, Sec. 841(b)(1)(B), applies only if the violation involved 100 grams or more of heroin.  And, he says that the evidence did not support the district court's finding that he knew about the 3 kilograms of heroin.  Rather, he says that the evidence shows that he only knew about 5 grams of heroin.  However, even if it were relevant for sentencing purposes that Beasley believed the suitcase contained only five grams of heroin, the same offense level would apply.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(C) (30 years maximum sentence if repeat offender and violation involved less than 100 grams of heroin);  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1(B) (specifying level 34 if statutory maximum for offense exceeds 25 years).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless, the evidence was more than sufficient to support the district court's factual conclusion that Beasley knew the suitcase contained about three kilograms of heroin.  The complex nature of the crime, the elaborate delivery precautions, the suitcase that in fact contained more than three kilograms of heroin, the fact that Makdessi told him the suitcase contained a lot of heroin, the fact that heroin had leaked out and was contained in a shower cap, and his having lifted and shaken the suitcase, together provide more than enough support for a finding that he actually knew the transaction involved more than one kilogram.  The only contrary evidence lies in the fact that he paid only $20,000, far less than the wholesale value of one kilogram.  Yet, nothing in the record suggests that the $20,000 sum was meant to be more than a partial payment.  Thus, this fact does not lead us to a contrary conclusion.  Because the record supports a finding of actual knowledge (and because any error was harmless), we need not consider other mental states and other circumstances.  Cf. United States v. Ekwunoh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1807425\"><a href=\"/opinion/1807425/united-states-v-ekwunoh/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 179 (E.D.N.Y.1993) (holding that, in some circumstances, defendant cannot be sentenced for possessing more drugs than he reasonably believed he possessed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.   Beasley says that his counsel was \"ineffective\" in failing to attack the \"chain of custody\" receipts for the heroin, which attack, in his view, represented his only hope of acquittal.  The record before us provides no basis for accepting his \"ineffective assistance\" claim.  The government introduced what seems to be strong evidence of custody.  The trial court, as a general matter, praised counsel's performance.  We do not normally consider claims of \"ineffective assistance\" on direct appeal, for such claims may require a court to go outside the trial record, for example, to consider counsel's trial strategy.  United States v. Mala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1062-63 (1st Cir.1993).  We see no reason for making an exception to that rule in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  Waiver of Counsel.   In mid-trial Beasley asked the trial court to permit him to discharge his counsel and proceed on his own.  The trial judge warned Beasley about the dangers of doing so.  But, when Beasley persisted, he granted Beasley's request, having asked counsel to remain to advise Beasley if necessary.  Beasley now argues that the \"totality of the circumstances\" establish that Beasley did not \"knowingly and intelligently\" waive his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  See Faretta v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 835, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He says that the record does not make it sufficiently clear that he \"was aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self representation, the technical requirements of trial, and the potential penalties he was facing.\"   Appellant's Opening Brief at 29;  see Maynard, 545 F.2d at 279.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the record, we do not agree with Beasley's conclusions.  The district court clearly explained the disadvantages of his choice and the technical nature of the trial.  The judge discussed in detail the calling of witnesses, the presentation of closing arguments, and the need to review jury instructions, all to help Beasley understand the magnitude of what he proposed to do.  Moreover, Beasley's past record--his two prior drug convictions--suggest some familiarity with the serious nature of trials and their potential technicality.  Similarly, the fact that Beasley had previously received a five-year sentence for violating the same statute, along with the notice of enhanced sentence that the government sent to Beasley and the detention hearing where the government told Beasley he faced a possible life sentence, all indicate that Beasley was aware of the potential penalties he was facing.  Beasley now says that he erroneously thought he would not be permitted to testify unless he dismissed his lawyer, but the record provides no basis for the district court's having believed Beasley entertained that thought nor any objective basis for his having done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the court's explanation of disadvantages of self-representation and the technicalities of the trial, Beasley insisted, quite clearly, that he wanted to represent himself.  The trial court, therefore, properly permitted him to do so and wisely asked his counsel to stay and offer advice if necessary.  We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Reasonable Doubt.   Beasley argues that the law required the district court to define the term \"reasonable doubt\" in its jury instructions.  The court, however, gave the type of instruction that this court approved in United States v. Olmstead, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496773\"><a href=\"/opinion/496773/united-states-v-george-olmstead/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
