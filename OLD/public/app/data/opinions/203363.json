R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Michael B.\nMukasey has been substituted for former Attorney General Alberto R.\nGonzales.\n\f            Per Curiam.    Petitioner Jean Winer Tropnas, a native and\n\ncitizen of Haiti, sought asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).            Tropnas\n\nmaintained that he feared persecution on account of his political\n\nactivities in Haiti.      An Immigration Judge (IJ) concluded that his\n\nfear of future persecution was not well-founded and consequently\n\ndenied   his   application    and   ordered    removal.    The   Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA), writing separately, affirmed and adopted\n\nthe IJ's ruling and issued a final order of removal.              Tropnas\n\npetitions for judicial review.            Because there is substantial\n\nevidence in the record to support the BIA's decision, we deny the\n\npetition.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            On or about July 20, 2001, Jean Winer Tropnas entered the\n\nUnited States through Canada.       He was apprehended in Vermont and\n\nplaced in removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).\n\nTropnas filed an application requesting asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under CAT.         In support of his application,\n\nhe claimed to hold a well-founded fear of future persecution on\n\naccount of his political opinion.         At his hearing, Tropnas offered\n\ndocumentary and testimonial evidence, summarized as follows.\n\n            Tropnas became politically active in 1992.       He joined an\n\nopposition political party, the Christian Nationalist Party of\n\nHaiti (PNCH) and as a member he was responsible for teaching people\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fin the community about education and advocacy.     Tropnas also was\n\nresponsible for coordinating activities with other progressive\n\norganizations and he eventually became personally active in some of\n\nthese organizations, promoting, among other causes, literacy and\n\npolitical activity.\n\n          The organizations with which Tropnas was involved were\n\ncritical of Haiti's then-president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and\n\nTropnas himself openly expressed his opposition to Aristide and his\n\nFanmi Lavalas Party.   Specifically, Tropnas, an artist, created\n\npolitical drawings critical of Aristide and the government that\n\nwere displayed and disseminated throughout the community.\n\n          Largely because of his political artwork, Tropnas was\n\npersonally threatened in both 1995 and 1999.        In 1995, after\n\nTropnas returned from hanging political posters, shots were fired\n\nat his aunt's house where he was staying.     A friend told Tropnas\n\nmore \"difficulties\" would come if he did not cease his political\n\nactivities.   Later, in 1999, after being similarly warned by a\n\nfriend, some individuals banged on the door of the aunt's house,\n\ntelling Tropnas that if he did not stop his political activities\n\nthey would kill him and his family would be in danger.      A month\n\nlater, when Tropnas was on his way home from school, neighbors\n\nwarned him not to return to his aunt's house because Lavalas\n\nsupporters had set a trap.   He stayed at his father's house and his\n\naunt later confirmed that Lavalas supporters had come to her home\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fand threatened to harm Tropnas.   Tropnas claimed that he did not\n\nreport these incidents to the police for fear of reprisal but also\n\ntestified that no member of the government had ever threatened,\n\nharmed, or arrested him. He also testified that \"[n]obody has ever\n\ncome to his father's house or sought to find him at that location.\"\n\nAdditionally, there was evidence that during this period he made\n\nseveral trips to the Dominican Republic to sell his paintings,\n\nvoluntarily returning to Haiti after each.\n\n           The incidents in 1999 prompted Tropnas to obtain a visa\n\nand travel to Jamaica.    There he began studies at the Jamaica\n\nSchool of Preaching, a theological school.       After one year of\n\nschool he returned to Haiti in 2000 for six weeks.   During his stay\n\nin Haiti the electricity was out and three opposition party members\n\nin his community were killed.   As a result, Tropnas testified, he\n\ndecided to leave Haiti to finish his studies in Jamaica.\n\n           After a short stay in Jamaica, Tropnas left for Canada.\n\nSoon after arriving in Canada, Tropnas crossed over the Canadian\n\nborder into the United States.        After he was apprehended, he\n\napplied for asylum and appeared in Immigration Court for his\n\nhearing.   At the hearing, in addition to testifying about his\n\npolitical activities and the incidents in Haiti, Tropnas mentioned\n\nthat he had a brother in the United States.\n\n           At the close of proceedings, the IJ denied Tropnas'\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\n\n                                -4-\n\funder CAT.    Although stating both that Tropnas appeared to testify\n\ntruthfully about his political activities and the incidents in\n\nHaiti, and that his testimony overall was \"credible, consistent and\n\ndetailed,\" the IJ nonetheless found his fear of future persecution\n\nneither subjectively genuine nor objectively reasonable.1                       In\n\nrejecting     Tropnas'    claim      that   his     fear   of   persecution   was\n\nobjectively reasonable, the IJ focused on both Tropnas' admission\n\nthat members of the Haitian government had never threatened,\n\narrested, or harmed him and on his testimony that he had spent six\n\nweeks in Haiti on his last visit without incident.                The IJ further\n\nsuggested that Tropnas could safely relocate to his father's home\n\nupon his return.\n\n             The BIA, in a separate opinion, affirmed and adopted the\n\nIJ's findings.    Tropnas focuses his petition entirely on the BIA's\n\ndenial of his asylum claim.2\n\n                                        II.\n\n             Where, as here, the BIA has written separately while\n\nadopting and affirming an IJ's decision, we review portions of the\n\nIJ's   decision   as     part   of    the   final    decision    of   the   board.\n\nHerandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).                  We\n\n\n\n1\n The IJ did question the veracity of an explanation offered by\nTropnas for his entry into the United States from Canada.\n2\n Because he makes no argument regarding the BIA's denial of his\nwithholding of removal and CAT claims, those claims have been\nwaived. See Tai v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                        -5-\n\fapply the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard, Carcamo-\n\nRecinos v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 253, 256 (1st Cir. 2004), and we will\n\nuphold the decision if it is supported by \"reasonable, substantial,\n\nand probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"            Ang\n\nv. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).\n\nWe will upset the BIA's decision only if \"[t]he record evidence\n\nwould    compel   a    reasonable    factfinder   to   make   a    contrary\n\ndetermination.\"       8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Pan v. Gonzales, 445\n\nF.3d 60, 61 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            In order to obtain asylum, the petitioner bears the\n\nburden of establishing that he is a \"refugee.\"         Afful v. Ashcroft,\n\n380 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2004).       A petitioner may establish refugee\n\nstatus by demonstrating past persecution, or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution, on the basis of one of five statutory grounds:\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.        8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).\n\n            To be \"well-founded\" a fear of future persecution must be\n\nboth (1) subjectively genuine and (2) objectively reasonable.\n\nToloza-Jimenez v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 155, 161 (1st Cir. 2006).           As\n\nto the second prong, a petitioner must provide \"credible, direct,\n\nand specific evidence\" that would objectively support a reasonable\n\nfear of individualized persecution. Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st\n\nCir.    1992)).   The    cases   suggest   that   meeting   the   objective\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\freasonableness requirement requires establishing a \"reasonable\n\npossibility of persecution.\"    See e.g.,   Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168\n\nF.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480\n\nU.S. 421, 450 (1987)).\n\n          We conclude that \"reasonable, substantial, and probative\"\n\nevidence supports the BIA's determination that Tropnas did not\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of future persecution.         Although\n\nTropnas did establish that he was politically active in Haiti,\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the conclusion that his fear of\n\nfuture persecution is not objectively reasonable.3\n\n          Although Tropnas was personally threatened in 1995 and\n\n1999, nine years have passed since the latest incident. See Palma-\n\nMazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 37 n.2 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting\n\nsignificant passage of time following fear-triggering incident may\n\nserve to rebut even a presumption of future persecution).          The\n\nevents in 2000 that prompted Tropnas' most recent departure from\n\nHaiti, specifically the loss of electrical power and the killing of\n\nthree individuals in his community, were not personally connected\n\nto him in any way.\n\n          Moreover,   Tropnas    produced   no   evidence   that   the\n\ngovernment or other groups continued actively looking for him. His\n\n\n\n3\n Because substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that\nTropnas' fear was objectively unreasonable, we need not address its\ndetermination regarding the subjective genuineness of Tropnas'\nfear.\n\n                                 -7-\n\ffailure to do so is especially damaging, given that he has family\n\nin Haiti who would likely communicate any such threats and friends\n\nwho have warned him about threats in the past.\n\n            Finally,   as     the    IJ    recognized,         even   assuming     that\n\nindividuals in Haiti are still looking for Tropnas, that would not\n\nnecessarily create an objectively reasonable basis for his fear\n\nbecause in the past Tropnas has safely relocated to his father's\n\nhouse -- a place where he himself indicated his persecutors have\n\nnever   sought   him   out.         See   8     C.F.R.   §     1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B),\n\n(b)(2)(ii); Susanto v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 57, 61 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(denying asylum where one of petitioners testified that she and her\n\nfamily had safely relocated to uncle's home during periods of\n\nstrife); El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 199 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(noting evidence of ability to relocate may undercut well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution).\n\n            In   addition     to     challenging         the    BIA's      conclusions\n\nregarding his well-founded fear of persecution, Tropnas claims that\n\nwe   must   reverse    the    BIA's       ruling    on    the     ground    that   the\n\nadministrative tribunal failed to address certain matters in its\n\nopinion.    See El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 203.                      Specifically, he\n\nalleges that the BIA \"made no specific analysis of the country\n\nconditions, and failed to address the country conditions evidence\n\nas it related to [his] claim.\"            But the IJ did specifically state\n\nthat, \"the conditions in Haiti have changed, although they do\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fremain violent, chaotic, and politically confusing.\"      The BIA\n\nadopted those findings in its opinion.\n\n                              III.\n\n          For the reasons discussed above, the petition for review\n\nmust be denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

He was apprehended in Vermont and\n\nplaced in removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).\n\nTropnas filed an application requesting asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under CAT.

The\n\nevents in 2000 that prompted Tropnas' most recent departure from\n\nHaiti, specifically the loss of electrical power and the killing of\n\nthree individuals in his community, were not personally connected\n\nto him in any way.\n\n          Moreover,   Tropnas    produced   no   evidence   that   the\n\ngovernment or other groups continued actively looking for him. His\n\n\n\n3\n Because substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that\nTropnas' fear was objectively unreasonable, we need not address its\ndetermination regarding the subjective genuineness of Tropnas'\nfear.\n\n                                 -7-\n\ffailure to do so is especially damaging, given that he has family\n\nin Haiti who would likely communicate any such threats and friends\n\nwho have warned him about threats in the past.\n\n            Finally,   as     the    IJ    recognized,         even   assuming     that\n\nindividuals in Haiti are still looking for Tropnas, that would not\n\nnecessarily create an objectively reasonable basis for his fear\n\nbecause in the past Tropnas has safely relocated to his father's\n\nhouse -- a place where he himself indicated his persecutors have\n\nnever   sought   him   out.
