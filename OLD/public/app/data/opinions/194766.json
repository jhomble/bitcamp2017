Certain\n\njoint petitioners  and intervenors1  contend that  FERC erred\n\nwhen it:  (1) held that the benefits of the merger outweighed\n\nits costs; and  (2) failed  to condition the  merger on  NU's\n\nwaiver  of  single  participant  status (\"SPS\")  in  the  New\n\nEngland Power Pool (\"NEPOOL\").  A group of public and private\n\nelectric  utilities,  state   commissions,  state   agencies,\n\nindependent  power producers,  cogenerators and  electric end\n\nusers2  claim that  FERC  erred when  it:   (1)  allowed  the\n\nconsummation of  the merger upon  the filing of,  rather than\n\nupon   approval  of,   a  transmission   tariff;  (2) adopted\n\n                    \n\n1   Joint petitioners and intervenors include:  Central Maine\nPower  Company; Boston Edison  Company; Bangor Hydro-Electric\nCompany;  the  Towns  of  Concord,  Norwood  and   Wellesley,\nMassachusetts;    Maine    Public    Utilities    Commission;\nMassachusetts   Department   of  Public   Utilities;  Vermont\nDepartment of Public  Service; Vermont Public Service  Board;\nRhode  Island Attorney  General;  Rhode  Island  Division  of\nPublic  Utilities  and   Carriers;  Massachusetts   Municipal\nWholesale  Electric  Company;  and,  City of  Holyoke  Gas  &amp;\nElectric Department.\n\n2    This group  of petitioners and  intervenors includes the\njoint petitioners and intervenors  listed in n.1, supra (with\n                                                       \nthe  exception of  Central Maine  Power Company),  and:   The\nAmerican  Paper  Institute,   Inc.;  American  Public   Power\nAssociation;  Canal  Electric Company;  Commonwealth Electric\nCompany;  Cambridge  Electric  Light  Company;  Massachusetts\nAttorney General; and, Montaup Electric Company.\n\n                             -6-\n\ntransmission   access  conditions  that  gave  \"native  load\"\n\ncustomers  a priority over  other customers; and (3) endorsed\n\n\"opportunity  cost\" pricing  principles.   The Holyoke  Gas &amp;\n\nElectric Department (\"Holyoke\")  argues that FERC  erred when\n\nit  failed  to:   (1) conduct  an  appropriate review  of the\n\nenvironmental impact  of the  proposed merger; and,  (2) make\n\nfindings    regarding    allegations    of    anticompetitive\n\nconsequences  of  the merger  that  were  unique to  Holyoke.\n\nFinally,  Northeast  Utilities   Service  Company   (\"NUSCO\")\n\nasserts that FERC's orders  changing the terms of  three rate\n\nschedules  filed in  conjunction with its  merger application\n\nwere arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.\n\n          For   the   reasons   which   follow,   we   reject\n\npetitioners' arguments and affirm the  Commission's decisions\n\nwith the exception of the Commission's decision to change the\n\nterms  of the  Seabrook Power  Contract which  we  remand for\n\nconsideration under the \"public interest\" standard.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND.\n\n     A.   Parties to the Approved Merger.\n\n          Northeast  Utilities (\"NU\") is a registered holding\n\ncompany under the Public Utility Holding Company  Act of 1935\n\n(PUHCA).  15 U.S.C.   79 et seq. (1988).  Northeast Utilities\n                                \n\nService Company (\"NUSCO\") is  a service company subsidiary of\n\n                             -7-\n\nNU   and  supplies  centralized  administrative  and  support\n\nservices to NU's operating companies.3\n\n          Prior to the merger,  Public Service Company of New\n\nHampshire (\"PSNH\")  was the  largest electric utility  in New\n\nHampshire, supplying  electric service to some 375,000 retail\n\ncustomers,  approximately  three-quarters   of  the   State's\n\npopulation, in every county in the State.  PSNH also provided\n\nwholesale service to the New  Hampshire Electric Cooperative,\n\nthree  New Hampshire  municipalities, and  one investor-owned\n\nutility,  Vermont  Electric  Power  Company.   PSNH  had  the\n\nlargest  ownership  share,  approximately  35.6  percent,  of\n\nSeabrook Unit  No. 1, a nuclear  generating facility declared\n\nto be available for service on June 30, 1990.\n\n     B.   The Merger Proposal.\n\n          On  January  28,  1988,  PSNH   filed  a  voluntary\n\npetition  in  the  United  States Bankruptcy  Court  for  the\n\nDistrict of New Hampshire for reorganization under Chapter 11\n\nof  the Bankruptcy Code.   11 U.S.C.    1101 et  seq. (1988).\n                                                     \n\nPSNH  alleged that it was unable to  recover in its rates the\n\noutlays  it had made in the construction and operation of the\n\nSeabrook  nuclear power  plant.   On  April  20, 1990,  after\n\n                    \n\n3    NU's operating companies are Connecticut Light and Power\nCompany  (CL&amp;P),  Western  Massachusetts   Electric  Company,\nHolyoke  Water  Power  Company (HWP)  and  HWP's wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, Holyoke Power and Electric Company (HP&amp;E).  These\ncompanies are wholly-owned subsidiaries  of NU and are public\nutilities supplying retail and wholesale electric service  in\nConnecticut and Massachusetts.\n\n                             -8-\n\nsifting through several  competing reorganization plans,  the\n\nbankruptcy court  approved NU's  proposal to merge  with PSNH\n\nand to  acquire and operate  all of PSNH's  power facilities.\n\nSee In re Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, 963  F.2d 469,\n                                             \n\n470 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, Rochman v. Northeast Utilities\n                                                             \n\nService Co., 113 S. Ct. 304 (1992).\n           \n\n          NU's proposal contained a two-step process:  first,\n\nPSNH would  emerge from  bankruptcy as a  stand-alone company\n\nbound  to a merger agreement  with NU; second,  PSNH would be\n\nmerged  with   an  NU  subsidiary  created   solely  for  the\n\nacquisition (NU Acquisition Corporation), with  PSNH emerging\n\nas  the surviving entity.  After  the merger, PSNH would be a\n\nwholly-owned  subsidiary   of  NU  and  would   transfer  its\n\nownership  interest   in  Seabrook  to  a   newly  formed  NU\n\nsubsidiary,   North   Atlantic  Energy   Corporation  (\"North\n\nAtlantic\").    The second  step  would occur  only  after all\n\nnecessary  approvals   were   received  from   the   relevant\n\nregulatory agencies.\n\n     C.   Procedural History.\n\n          On January 8, 1990, NUSCO, on behalf of NU and NU's\n\noperating subsidiaries, filed an  application with FERC under\n\nsection 203 of  the Federal  Power Act (\"FPA\"),  16 U.S.C.   \n\n824b (1988), seeking authorization for PSNH to dispose of all\n\nof its  jurisdictional facilities and  concurrently to  merge\n\nwith, and become  a subsidiary  of, NU.   In connection  with\n\n                             -9-\n\nthis application,  NUSCO filed four rate  schedules with FERC\n\npursuant to    205 of the FPA:  the Seabrook Power Contract,4\n\nthe   Sharing  Agreement5   and   two  Capacity   Interchange\n\nAgreements.6\n\n          The  Commission  consolidated consideration  of the\n\nmerger  application and  rate  schedules,  accepted the  rate\n\nschedules for  filing and suspended their  effectiveness, and\n\nset for  hearings before an administrative  law judge (\"ALJ\")\n\nthe questions  of whether the  Commission should grant  the  \n\n203  application  and  approve   the  rate  schedules.    See\n                                                             \n\nNortheast Utilities Service Co.,  50 F.E.R.C.   61,266, reh'g\n                                                             \n\ngranted  in part  and denied  in part,  51 F.E.R.C.    61,177\n                                     \n\n(1990).  In its order, the Commission directed the parties to\n\n                    \n\n4  The  Seabrook Power Contract  is a life-of-the-unit  power\nsales agreement between PSNH  and North Atlantic entered into\nconcurrently with  NU's acquisition of PSNH  and the transfer\nof PSNH's share  of Seabrook  to North Atlantic.   Under  the\ncontract, PSNH  agreed  to purchase  North Atlantic's  entire\nshare of Seabrook capacity and  energy, according to a  cost-\nof-service formula rate.  The contract was intended to ensure\nthat  North Atlantic would recover all of its costs from PSNH\nregardless of whether or not Seabrook actually operated.\n\n5   The Sharing Agreement allocates the benefits and obliga-\ntions from the  integrated operation of PSNH and  the current\nNU  system, as well as  the joint planning  and operations of\nthese  systems.   This  agreement established  a formula  for\nsharing the  expected post-merger benefits that  would accrue\nto NU and PSNH  operating companies as a result  of operating\nefficiencies  and  the  ability  to take  single  participant\nstatus under the NEPOOL agreement.\n\n6   The  two Capacity Interchange Agreements provide  for the\nsale  and purchase  of  energy between  PSNH and  Connecticut\nLight &amp; Power Company (CL&amp;P) over a ten-year term.\n\n                             -10-\n\naddress  the  effect of  the proposed  merger on  NU's market\n\npower and \"whether any transmission conditions  are necessary\n\nto eliminate any  adverse effect of the  proposed merger and,\n\nif  so,  what specific  conditions  should be  imposed.\"   50\n\nF.E.R.C. at 61,834-35.\n\n          On December  20, 1990,  the ALJ issued  its Initial\n\nDecision  approving  the     203  application  and  the  rate\n\nschedules   with   certain   modifications  and   conditions.\n\nNortheast Utilities Service Co., 53 F.E.R.C.   63,020 (1990).\n                               \n\nThe Commission, in Opinion No. 364, issued on August 9, 1991,\n\naffirmed in  part and  reversed in part  the ALJ's  decision,\n\nconditionally approving  the    203 application and  the rate\n\nschedules.

On  January 29,  1992,  after  considering\n\nadditional  filings  by  the  parties and  oral  argument  on\n\ntransmission  pricing issues,  the Commission  issued Opinion\n\nNo. 364-A,  affirming its  conditional approval of  the   203\n\napplication  and rate schedules.  Northeast Utilities Service\n                                                             \n\nCo., 58 F.E.R.C.   61,070 (1992).\n   \n\n          Petitions for review of  Opinions No. 364 and 364-A\n\nwere  filed in  this court  and in  the District  of Columbia\n\nCircuit  Court.     The  Judicial   Panel  on   Multidistrict\n\nLitigation  consolidated these petitions  for review  in this\n\ncourt, where  further petitions for  review were  filed.   28\n\nU.S.C.   2112(a) (1988).  Subsequently, in Opinion No. 364-B,\n\n                             -11-\n\nthe Commission denied a request for  rehearing of Opinion No.\n\n364-A.

A petition for review of Opinions No. 364-A and 364-\n\nB was filed in this court, where it was consolidated with the\n\nearlier filed  petitions.  We review  the Commission's orders\n\nunder the jurisdiction established by 16 U.S.C.   825l.\n\nII.

Background.\n                         \n\n          In reaching  his  decision to  approve the  NU-PSNH\n\nmerger,  the   ALJ  found  that  the   merger  would  produce\n\nsignificant benefits.  Specifically, he found that:  (1) PSNH\n\nwould emerge from bankruptcy  as a viable utility on  a solid\n\nfinancial  footing,  53  F.E.R.C.  at  65,211;  (2)  improved\n\nmanagement techniques and economies of scale would reduce the\n\noperating costs  of Seabrook by  some $527  million,7 id.  at\n                                                         \n\n65,212; (3) application of NU operating procedures  to PSNH's\n\nfossil steam plants would save  $100 million, id. at  65,213;\n                                                 \n\n(4) reductions in  administrative and general  expenses would\n\nsave  $124  million, id.;  (5) NU's  record of  buying lower-\n                        \n\npriced coal on the  spot market would save $39  million, id.;\n                                                            \n\nand (6) the merger would yield $360 million in savings for NU\n\nbecause of  its ability to elect  \"single participant status\"\n\n                    \n\n7   This, and all other dollar amounts are net present values\nunless otherwise noted.\n\n                             -13-\n\nin  the  New  England  Power  Pool  (NEPOOL),  a  power  pool\n\ncomprised of most of the utilities in New England.

Under the  authority of   203(b)  of the FPA, 16\n\nU.S.C.    824b(b), the  ALJ  approved the  merger subject  to\n\nseveral conditions, including the  following:  (1) the merged\n\ncompany  must  offer  firm  (non-interruptible)  transmission\n\nservice  for a minimum of 30 days  and a maximum of 20 years,\n\n53  F.E.R.C.  at  65,220-21;  (2) non-firm  service  must  be\n\noffered  for a one-day minimum  term, id. at  65,220; (3) the\n                                         \n\nmerger would be consummated concurrently with the filing of a\n\ncompliance tariff which fully reflects  all of the terms  and\n\nconditions set  out in  the ALJ's  Initial  Decision, id.  at\n                                                         \n\n65,221;  (4) NU  must  implement its  New Hampshire  Corridor\n\nProposal,8 thereby  making available  400 MW  of transmission\n\n                    \n\n8   The  New Hampshire Corridor Transmission  Proposal allows\nNew  England  utilities  to purchase  long-term  transmission\nrights from NU-PSNH in order to connect with power sources in\nnorthern New England and Canada.

It held,  however, that the $364 million  cost-shift\n\nbetween NU-PSNH and other NEPOOL members should not have been\n\ncounted  as a benefit of the merger because it simply shifted\n\ncosts dollar-for-dollar  among the membership without any net\n\nsavings.10    56 F.E.R.C.  at  61,997.   The  Commission also\n\nheld  that,  in evaluating  the  costs  and benefits  of  the\n\nmerger, the ALJ  correctly attributed the benefits  resulting\n\nfrom  the merger to the  merger even if  those benefits could\n\nhave been  achieved  by other  means.11   Id.  at  61,994-96.\n                                             \n\nThis conclusion  was reiterated  on rehearing in  Opinion No.\n\n364-A.  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,186-87.\n\n                    \n\n9   \"Wheeling\" is defined as the \"transfer by direct trans-\nmission or displacement [of]  electric power from one utility\nto another  over the facilities of  an intermediate utility.\"\nOtter Tail Power Co. v.

Discussion.\n                         \n\n          Petitioners make two claims  with regard to  FERC's\n\nevaluation  of the costs and benefits  of the NU-PSNH merger.\n\nFirst,  they  argue  that  the  Commission  should  not  have\n\nincluded resolution of PSNH's bankruptcy as a  benefit of the\n\nmerger because:  (1) PSNH actually emerged from bankruptcy on\n\nMay 16, 1991, the  effective date of the  Reorganization Plan\n\n(\"RP\");  and  (2) prior  to  gaining  the bankruptcy  court's\n\napproval  of the two-step RP, PSNH  had to show that it would\n\nbe  financially  viable  as   a  stand-alone  entity  because\n\nregulatory approval  for the  second step  of the  RP (merger\n\nwith and into NU) was not assured.  These two facts, however,\n\ndo not  imply that  it was  error for  FERC  to consider  the\n\n\"resolution of PSNH's bankruptcy\" as  a benefit, indeed as  a\n\nprincipal benefit, of the merger.  \n\n          It  is  true  that  PSNH, as  a  technical  matter,\n\n\"emerged\" from  bankruptcy prior  to FERC's  consideration of\n\nthe proposed merger.  The ALJ and the Commission did not hold\n\notherwise.   The  ALJ  stated, and  the Commission  summarily\n\naffirmed the fact that \"[t]he merger is part of  a plan which\n                                                       \n\nenables a  reorganized PSNH to  emerge from bankruptcy.\"   53\n\nF.E.R.C. at 65,211  (emphasis added); see also 56 F.E.R.C. at\n                                              \n\n                             -18-\n\n61,993.  Like the state regulators  who approved the two-step\n\nmerger  plan, the Commission  evaluated the plan  as a whole,\n\nanticipating  \"the merger   not  `stand alone' PSNH    as the\n\nultimate destiny  for the reorganized company.\"   53 F.E.R.C.\n\nat 65,211.   \"All parties to  the reorganization contemplated\n\n[stand  alone]  status as  an interim  step  en route  to the\n\nmerger.\"  Id.   It was the entire  plan, which admittedly had\n             \n\ntwo  sequential and  severable  steps, that  allowed PSNH  to\n\nemerge  from bankruptcy.  There is no evidence that the state\n\nregulators would have approved a plan to allow PSNH to emerge\n\nfrom bankruptcy  that included  only the first  \"stand alone\"\n\nstep.  Indeed, there is evidence to the contrary.\n\n          FERC  also found that \"resolving\" PSNH's bankruptcy\n\nmeant  more  than  simply  the emergence  of  PSNH  from  the\n\nprotection of  bankruptcy court.   FERC held  that the  final\n\nresolution of PSNH's bankruptcy included the treatment of its\n\ncreditors and  stockholders who stood  to lose  approximately\n\n$250 million  in  the absence  of  the merger.    As the  ALJ\n\nobserved, the Commission \"regard[s] the right of these public\n\nbondholders as of primary importance after the consumers have\n\nbeen protected.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,211 (quoting In re Evans,\n                                                            \n\n1 F.P.C. 511, 517  (1937) (approving an acquisition involving\n\nthe reorganization  of a bankrupt utility)).   The Commission\n\nalso held that it was  in the public interest to  approve the\n\ncreation  of a  stronger, more  viable merged  entity, rather\n\n                             -19-\n\nthan leaving PSNH in a \"weakened\", \"stand alone\" state.  This\n\nholding was sufficiently supported by evidence in the record.\n\n          Petitioners also  claim that, given  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's   \"feasibility   finding\"  required   by   11  U.S.C.\n\n  1129(a)(11),12  the Commission  was estopped  from reaching\n\nthe  conclusion that a \"stand  alone\" PSNH would  be \"weak.\" \n\nWe disagree.   The  bankruptcy court  and FERC evaluated  the\n\nmerger proposal under  different standards.   The  bankruptcy\n\ncourt  was required  to determine  the likelihood  of further\n\nliquidation or reorganization proceedings were the plan to be\n\napproved.  FERC was obliged to determine whether the plan was\n\n\"consistent  with   the  public   interest.\"    It   was  not\n\ninconsistent for FERC to find that although PSNH was  capable\n\nof  surviving  as  a stand  alone  entity,  it  would not  be\n\n\"consistent  with the  public interest\"  to prevent  a merger\n\nthat  would  result   in  an  even  stronger  utility.    The\n\nprinciples of estoppel simply do not apply  in a case such as\n\nthis, where the issues litigated and the standards applied in\n\nthe two proceedings are so different. \n\n                    \n\n12   The Bankruptcy Code provides that:\n     (a)   The   court   shall  confirm   a   plan   [of\n     reorganization]  only  if   all  of  the  following\n     requirements are met:\n     (11) confirmation  of the plan is not  likely to be\n     followed  by  the  liquidation,  or  the  need  for\n     further financial reorganization, of the  debtor or\n     any successor to the  debtor under the plan, unless\n     such liquidation  or reorganization is  proposed in\n     the plan.\n  11 U.S.C.   1129(a)(11).\n\n                             -20-\n\n          Even were petitioners correct in their asseveration\n\nthat  FERC  improperly  counted  the  resolution   of  PSNH's\n\nbankruptcy  as a  benefit  of the  merger, \"the  Commission's\n\nerror would be immaterial in light of the overwhelming excess\n\nof other  benefits ($791  million) over  the costs  (0) still\n\nattributable . . . to the acquisition.\"   City of Holyoke Gas\n                                                             \n\n&amp; Elec.

Cir. 1992).\n                       \n\n          Second,  petitioners  argue that  FERC  erred  as a\n\nmatter  of law  in  weighing as  merger  benefits results  or\n\nalleged  savings   that  were,  or  could   be,  achieved  by\n\n\"alternate  means.\"   Specifically, petitioners  contend that\n\nFERC's   failure  to   apply  the   \"alternate   means\"  test\n\ncontradicted  general agency  policy  and  general  antitrust\n\nprinciples. \n\n          It is undisputed  that utilities  are \"not  immune\"\n\nfrom antitrust laws.

At issue in this case is whether FERC is required by\n\nstatute,  or otherwise,  to  engage  in \"standard\"  antitrust\n\nanalysis before  passing on    203  merger applications.   In\n\nclaiming that  FERC has such an  obligation, petitioners rely\n\non a statute  governing agency approval of  bank mergers (the\n\n                             -21-\n\n\"Bank  Merger  Act\")  which   states  that  the  agency  with\n\njurisdiction over a proposed bank merger,13\n\n          shall not approve  \n             (A)  any  proposed merger  transaction\n          which  would result  in  a  monopoly,  or\n          which  would  be  in furtherance  of  any\n          combination  or conspiracy  to monopolize\n          or  to attempt to monopolize the business\n          of  banking in  any  part  of the  United\n          States, or\n             (B)   any    other   proposed   merger\n          transaction whose effect  in any  section\n          of  the country  may be  substantially to\n          lessen  competition, or to tend to create\n          a monopoly, or which in any  other manner\n          would be in restraint of trade, unless it\n          finds that the anticompetitive effects of\n          the  proposed   transaction  are  clearly\n          outweighed in the public interest  by the\n          probable  effects  of the  transaction in\n          meeting the convenience  and needs of the\n          community to be served. . . .\n          (6)   The    responsible   agency   shall\n          immediately  notify the  Attorney General\n          of any  approval by  it pursuant  to this\n          subsection    of   a    proposed   merger\n          transaction.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1828(c)(5)-(6).   The Supreme Court, interpreting\n\nthe Bank Merger Act, has held that before a bank merger which\n\nis  injurious to  the  public interest  may  be approved,  \"a\n\nshowing [must] be made that the gain expected from the merger\n\ncannot  reasonably be expected through other means.\"  U.S. v.\n                                                          \n\nPhillipsburg Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 399 U.S. 350, 372 (1970).\n                                  \n\nPetitioners claim that the language of the Bank Merger Act is\n\nsufficiently similar to the statute governing FERC's approval\n\n                    \n\n13   Jurisdiction varies  depending on whether  the resulting\nentity  is  a national  bank, a  state  member bank,  a state\nnonmember bank, or a savings association.\n\n                             -22-\n\nof  proposed  mergers,  16  U.S.C.    824b(a),  because  both\n\ncontain  a \"public interest\" standard, to require FERC to use\n\nthe \"alternate means\" test which  bank regulators must use in\n\nevaluating proposed bank mergers.  We disagree.\n\n          As with  any matter  of statutory construction,  we\n\nfirst examine the language  of the statute.  Under  16 U.S.C.\n\n  824b(a),  the  Commission  is required,  after  notice  and\n\nopportunity  for hearing,  to  approve a  proposed merger  of\n\nutility  facilities if  it finds  that the proposal  \"will be\n\nconsistent  with  the  public interest.\"    That  is all  the\n\nstatute  says.  There  is no explicit  reference to antitrust\n\npolicies or principles.   There is no  evidence that Congress\n\nsought  to  have  the  Commission  serve  as  an  enforcer of\n\nantitrust  policy  in  conjunction  with  the  Department  of\n\nJustice and  the Federal Trade  Commission.  The  Bank Merger\n\nAct  reveals a  quite different  intention.   There, Congress\n\nexplicitly  set out  standards for  approval of  bank mergers\n\nthat incorporate  principles  embodied  in  the  Sherman  and\n\nClayton  Acts.   12  U.S.C.   1828(c)(5).   By  requiring the\n\nreviewing  agency  to  notify  the Attorney  General  of  any\n\ndecision  to approve  a  proposed bank  merger,  12 U.S.C.   \n\n1828(c)(6),  Congress  expressed  its  desire  to  have  bank\n\nregulators  serve as pre-screening  bodies of  mergers which,\n\nbecause of their importance or character, in most  cases also\n\ndeserve the attention of the Department of Justice.\n\n                             -23-\n\n          The Bank  Merger Act  carries with it  the implicit\n\npresumption that  mergers are  to be disapproved  (the agency\n\n\"shall not approve\" a  bank merger \"unless it finds  that the\n\nanticompetitive  effects are clearly outweighed in the public\n\ninterest\"  by   the  benefits   of  the  merger,   12  U.S.C.\n\n  1828(c)(5)).   The  FPA,  on the  other hand,  requires the\n\nCommission to approve any merger that is \"consistent with the\n\npublic  interest.\"     16   U.S.C.     824b(a).     Antitrust\n\nconsiderations   are,   of   course,   relevant   in   FERC's\n\nconsideration of  the \"public interest\"  in merger proposals.\n\nThe  statute,  however,  does  not require  FERC  to  analyze\n\nproposed mergers under the same standards that the Department\n\nof Justice or bank regulators must apply.\n\n          Although  the  Commission  must  include  antitrust\n\nconsiderations in its public interest calculus under the FPA,\n\nit is not  bound to use antitrust principles when they may be\n\ninconsistent  with the  Commission's  regulatory goals.   See\n                                                             \n\nOtter  Tail,   410  U.S.   at   373  (\"[a]lthough   antitrust\n           \n\nconsiderations  may be  relevant [in  determining  the public\n\ninterest], they are not determinative\").

FERC's  Failure to Condition  Merger on NU's Waiver\n          of Single Participant Status.\n\n          Petitioners  argue  that  the  Commission  erred in\n\nfailing to  condition the merger on waiver  by NU and PSNH of\n\n\"single participant status\" (\"SPS\")  in the New England Power\n\nPool (\"NEPOOL\"), thereby preventing  the imposition of a $364\n\nmillion cost shift  from NU and PSNH to  the other members of\n\nNEPOOL.\n\n          1.   Background.\n                         \n\n          NEPOOL is  a power  pool comprised  of most  of the\n\nutilities in New England.  The association is governed by the\n\nNew England  Power  Pool Agreement  (\"the  Agreement\")  which\n\nestablishes a \"comprehensive interconnection and coordination\n\narrangement\" among  its members in order  \"to achieve greater\n\n                             -25-\n\nreliability and economies in the  production of electricity.\"\n\nGroton v.  FERC,  587  F.2d  1296,  1298  (D.C.  Cir.  1978).\n               \n\nSection  202(a)  of the  Federal  Power  Act encourages  such\n\nvoluntary  interconnection  and  coordination of  electricity\n\ngenerating facilities in order to achieve economies of scale.\n\n16  U.S.C.    824a; see  also 16  U.S.C.    824a-1 (regarding\n                             \n\npooling  agreements).  The Agreement  was approved as a filed\n\nrate  schedule  by  FERC's  predecessor,  the  Federal  Power\n\nCommission.   53 F.E.R.C. at  65,213.  Under  its terms, each\n\nmember  is  required  to   supply  the  pool  with  resources\n\n(\"Capacity Responsibility\") according to a formula based upon\n\nthe  relationship of the member's peak load to an estimate of\n\naggregate peak load of all members.\n\n          NU  experiences its  peak load  in the  summer, and\n\nPSNH experiences its peak load in the winter.  By aggregating\n\nthese two,  complementary, peak loads, NU-PSNH  can achieve a\n\nlower Capacity Responsibility than would  be the case if  the\n\ntwo   utilities  remained  separate.    Because  the  overall\n\ncapacity requirements of NEPOOL  will not change as  a result\n\nof the merger, the Capacity Responsibilities of other members\n\nmust rise to  make up  for the savings  accruing to  NU-PSNH.\n\nThe  ALJ  accepted  the  \"undisputed\" estimate  that  \"single\n\nparticipant status\" (SPS)  will result in a  shifting of some\n\n$360  million in costs from  NU-PSNH to other  members of the\n\npool.  Id.\n          \n\n                             -26-\n\n                             -27-\n\n          2.   Discussion.\n                         \n\n          Petitioners  offer six  arguments to  support their\n\nclaim that FERC erred  in failing to condition the  merger on\n\nwaiver of SPS by NU and PSNH.  First, petitioners  claim that\n\nthe Commission  did not  properly interpret the  provision of\n\nthe NEPOOL Agreement which  governs the election of SPS.   We\n\nagree with  the Commission's finding that  the Agreement both\n\nspecifically allows for the election  by NU-PSNH of SPS,  and\n\nencourages  such elections.    Section 3.1  of the  Agreement\n\nprovides in relevant part that:\n\n          All  Entities which  are controlled  by a\n          single person (such as a corporation or a\n          common law business  trust) which owns at\n          least seventy-five percent of  the voting\n          shares   of   each  of   them   shall  be\n                                               \n          collectively   treated    as   a   single\n          Participant   for    purposes   of   this\n          Agreement, if they elect  such treatment.\n          They are  encouraged to  do so.   Such an\n                                        \n          election shall  be  made by  signing  the\n          appropriate   form  at   the  end   of  a\n          counterpart of this Agreement.\n\n(Emphasis  supplied.)    Both  the  ALJ  and  the  Commission\n\ninterpreted section 3.1 to be  an explicit endorsement of the\n\nelection of  SPS by NU-PSNH.   The  ALJ stated that  \"[i]t is\n\nundisputed  that  NU  and   PSNH  qualify  for  such  [single\n\nparticipant]  status under  the Agreement.\"   53  F.E.R.C. at\n\n65,213.  The Commission  gave great weight to the  unrebutted\n\ntestimony  of  witness  Bigelow,   who  participated  in  the\n\nnegotiation of  the NEPOOL Agreement regarding  the intent of\n\nthe  original  signatories   to  the   Agreement  and   their\n\n                             -28-\n\nrecognition  of  such  potentially  large  cost-shifts  among\n\nNEPOOL members.  Bigelow stated:\n\n          [W]hen  we put  NEPOOL together  20 years\n          ago,  we  recognized  that  these  things\n          might happen.  This is not something that\n          snuck  up  on people. . . .   And  we did\n          discuss  at  length  what   would  happen\n          because . . . we were then coming up to a\n          potential   merger   of  Boston   Edison,\n          Eastern Utilities, New England Power.  It\n          was recognized that these kinds of things\n          could happen in the future and we spelled\n          out the ground rules and  recognized that\n          that would  happen when it happened.  And\n          the  people   who  didn't  like   it  got\n          something else for it.\n\n53  F.E.R.C.  at 65,214.   Both  the  ALJ and  the Commission\n\nrejected petitioners' claim on the basis of both the language\n\nof the Agreement, and Bigelow's unrebutted testimony that not\n\nonly  had the  signatories been  aware of such  a potentially\n\nlarge  savings  shift, but  that  those  utilities that  were\n\ndissatisfied  with this risk  received additional concessions\n\nas  compensation.    We  will not  disturb  the  Commission's\n\nfindings.\n\n          Second,  petitioners claim  that the  Agreement, as\n\ninterpreted in  NEPOOL Power Pool Agreement,  56 F.P.C. 1562,\n                                           \n\n1580 (1976), aff'd sub nom. Municipalities of Groton v. FERC,\n                                                            \n\n587 F.2d 1296 (D.C. Cir. 1978), prohibits utilities with peak\n\nloads  in different  seasons  from  electing  SPS.    As  the\n\nCommission  explained,  this  argument  mischaracterizes  the\n\nAgreement and  the decision  of the Federal  Power Commission\n\n(\"FPC\") in NEPOOL.\n                 \n\n                             -29-\n\n          The NEPOOL Agreement, as  initially filed\n          and    as   approved,    allowed   single\n          participant    status    for    utilities\n          controlled by a single \"person\" owning at\n          least 75 percent of the voting shares  of\n          each utility.  An exception was expressly\n          allowed  in the  filed agreement  for any\n          Vermont  utility  which  elected   to  be\n          grouped   with  Vermont   Electric  Power\n          Company.  This exception was approved for\n          essentially two reasons:  (1) the Vermont\n          utilities  had  long  acted  as  a single\n          contiguous  integrated  electric  entity;\n          and (2) since  they all experienced their\n          peak loads in winter,  single participant\n          status would not give them a lower NEPOOL\n          Capability Responsibility (and consequent\n          savings).    A   broader  exception   was\n          denied, however, for a group of municipal\n          utilities (represented by MMWEC) that was\n          not entitled to single participant status\n          and  that lacked the two cited attributes\n          of the  Vermont utilities.  The basis for\n          the denial was that allowing  such status\n          for \"any group of systems, such as MMWEC,\n          could   well   be   detrimental  to   the\n          functioning of NEPOOL.\"\n             The  NEPOOL  decision, thus,  does not\n          stand  for  the  proposition that  single\n          participant status is  available only  to\n          utilities  having their peak loads in the\n          same  season.    Instead,   another  way,\n          indeed   the   primary   way,  in   which\n          utilities  may qualify  is  if  they  are\n          controlled  by a  single  person with  at\n          least 75-percent common ownership.   That\n          is the basis upon  which NU and PSNH will\n          presumably seek to  qualify if the merger\n          is  approved.   Such status  is expressly\n          allowed   under   the  NEPOOL   Agreement\n          regardless of when NU and PSNH experience\n          their peak loads.\n\n56 F.E.R.C. at 61,996-97.  The reasons  offered by the FPC in\n\nits  decision  to  grant  a  special  exception  for  Vermont\n\nutilities seeking SPS were  not intended to be, and  are not,\n\nconditions, in  addition to those  set out in  the Agreement,\n\n                             -30-\n\nwhich must be satisfied to elect SPS.  The FPC did not narrow\n\nthe scope of Section  3.1 to apply only to  utilities sharing\n\nthe  same peak  load  season; rather,  it  created a  special\n\nexception to the  75 percent rule  to accommodate the  unique\n\nsituation faced by Vermont utilities.\n\n          Third, petitioners  claim that FERC failed  to give\n\nproper consideration  to Section  4.2 of the  Agreement, \"the\n\ninterests of  other  pool members,  and  the purpose  of  the\n\nAgreement as  a whole.\"  Essentially,  petitioners argue that\n\nallowing  NU-PSNH  to  elect  SPS  would  violate  a  general\n\nprovision  of the  Agreement, which states  that participants\n\n\"shall  not . . . take  advantage of  the provisions  of this\n\nAgreement so  as to harm another Participant  or to prejudice\n\nthe  position  of any  Participant  in  the electric  utility\n\nbusiness.\"   We  reject  this argument  for the  same reasons\n\nexpressed   by  the  Commission   in  its   decision  denying\n\npetitioners' request for a rehearing:\n\n          [W]e  find more  relevance in  the NEPOOL\n          Agreement's   explicit   endorsement   of\n          single  participant  status  than in  the\n          agreement's  general  goal of  \"equitable\n          sharing\"   and  prohibition   on  members\n          \"taking  advantage\"  of the  agreement to\n          harm  or prejudice  other  members.   The\n          NEPOOL Agreement  specifically encourages\n          eligible    parties   to    seek   single\n          participant status;  the provisions cited\n          by  the  intervenors  are   general,  not\n          specific.      Construing   the   general\n          consistent  with  the  specific, we  find\n          single participant status for  the merged\n          company  consistent   with  an  equitable\n          sharing,  as  envisioned  by  the  NEPOOL\n\n                             -31-\n\n          Agreement, and not  violative of the  ban\n          on  taking  advantage of  the agreement's\n          provisions  to  harm  or prejudice  other\n          members.\n\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,189.   We agree with FERC's  interpretation\n\nof  the  Agreement.     The  NEPOOL  signatories   explicitly\n\nencouraged  qualified  members  to  seek  SPS,   indeed  they\n\ncontemplated that members that merged might choose to do just\n\nthat.   We agree  with the  Commission's construction  of the\n\nAgreement which avoids a direct conflict between Sections 3.1\n\nand 4.2, and instead gives both provisions reasonable effect.\n\n          Fourth, petitioners argue that failure to condition\n\nthe   merger  on   waiver  of   SPS  would   create  \"serious\n\ndisincentives\"   for  current   members  to   continue  their\n\nmembership  in NEPOOL,  and  that the  breakup  of NEPOOL  is\n\ncontrary to the public interest.  Petitioners imply that FERC\n\ndid not take seriously their complaints about SPS, but rather\n\nrested its decision  not to  require a waiver  solely on  the\n\nfact that the Agreement allowed the election of SPS.  This is\n\nsimply not so.\n\n          The  Commission reversed  the ALJ  on the  issue of\n\nwhether SPS savings  should be  counted as a  benefit of  the\n\nmerger.   The Commission  found that  because the  cost shift\n\namounted  to  a  zero-sum   transaction,  with  NU  and  PSNH\n\nbenefitting and the other members burdened dollar-for-dollar,\n\nthe shift could not  be counted as a  benefit of the  merger.\n\n                             -32-\n\n56  F.E.R.C. at 61,997.  Thus, the Commission did not dismiss\n\npetitioners' claims regarding SPS without thought.\n\n          Also,  the ALJ  found,  and the  Commission agreed,\n\nthat SPS was essential to the merger, and that the merger, as\n\nconditioned, was in the public interest.  FERC must approve a\n\nproposed merger if it is consistent with the public interest.\n\n16  U.S.C.    824b(a).    FERC  has  the  discretion  to  add\n\nconditions  to a proposed  merger to  ensure that  the merger\n\nwill, taken as a whole, be in the public interest.  16 U.S.C.\n\n   824b(b).    FERC  need  not, however,  explain  why  every\n\ncondition, or failure to  establish a condition is consistent\n\nwith the public interest when considered separately and apart\n\nfrom the entire transaction.  Petitioners seem to argue  that\n\nFERC was required by law to  state why it was consistent with\n\nthe  public interest  to  follow the  explicit  terms of  the\n\napproved fifteen  year-old  NEPOOL Agreement  rather than  to\n\ncondition  the  merger  on   waiver  of  a  membership  right\n\nestablished by the Agreement.   FERC had no such  obligation.\n\nIt need not have  explained why it failed to add a particular\n\ncondition  prior to approving  a merger.   The statute simply\n\nprovides that \"[t]he Commission may grant any application for\n\nan order under this section in whole or in part and upon such\n\nterms and conditions as it  finds necessary or appropriate to\n\nsecure the  maintenance of adequate  service and coordination\n\nin  the   public  interest  of  facilities   subject  to  the\n\n                             -33-\n\njurisdiction  of the Commission.\"   16 U.S.C.    824b(b).  In\n\nthis  case, the Commission  set forth a  reasonable basis for\n\napproving the  merger as consistent with  the public interest\n\nin light of the supplementary conditions the Commission found\n\nnecessary.   FERC  need not  have gone  further than  this to\n\nexplain  why it  failed  to place  further conditions  on the\n\nmerger.\n\n          Fifth,   petitioners   allege   that   FERC   acted\n\ninconsistently in  its  treatment of  the NEPOOL  Agreement's\n\nprovisions regarding  voting rights and SPS.   The Commission\n\nadopted  a  condition limiting  the  merged company's  NEPOOL\n\nvoting  rights to  prevent PSNH  and NU  from gaining  a veto\n\npower  in NEPOOL.  56  F.E.R.C. at 62,043-45.   FERC reasoned\n\nthat,  while   there  was   evidence  that   the  signatories\n\nanticipated  that  large   cost-shifts  would  accompany  the\n\nelection  of SPS in merger  situations, there was no evidence\n\nthat they anticipated the  voting rights implications of such\n\nmergers.   58 F.E.R.C.  at 61,189.   It was not,  contrary to\n\npetitioners' argument,  inconsistent as a matter  of logic to\n\ncondition voting rights where the Agreement was silent on the\n\nneed or lack of need to do so, while failing to condition SPS\n\nwhere the  Agreement explicitly favored the  election of SPS.\n\nFurthermore, it was not  an error of law to  condition voting\n\nrights while  leaving SPS  rights untouched.   Petitioners do\n\nnot  contest the Commission's decision to condition NU-PSNH's\n\n                             -34-\n\nvoting  rights.    We  will uphold  whatever  conditions  the\n\nCommission  imposes on  a proposed  merger  so long  as their\n\nnecessity is supported in the record by substantial evidence.\n\n          Finally,  petitioners  contend that  the Commission\n\n\"failed to  explain why  burdening other NEPOOL  members with\n\n$364 million in additional  costs with no offsetting benefits\n\nto them is consistent  with the public interest.\"   In making\n\nthis argument, petitioners imply that each and every piece of\n\na complex package of merger agreements and conditions must be\n\nable to  withstand \"public interest\"  analysis without regard\n\nto other pieces of the package or to other conditions imposed\n\nby  the  Commission.   Petitioners  also  imply that  if  any\n\nindividual or group is harmed by a piece of the package, that\n\nprovision is not in the public interest and must therefore be\n\nstricken  or modified.   Both  implicit arguments  are deeply\n\nflawed.\n\n          In  evaluating a  transaction  such as  the one  at\n\nissue  here, the  Commission  is required  to  find that  the\n\nentire transaction, taken as a whole,  is consistent with the\n\npublic interest.  16 U.S.C.    824b(a).  Each element of  the\n\ntransaction  need not  benefit  every  utility or  individual\n\nwhich might  be affected; rather, the  whole transaction must\n\nbe consistent with the interest of \"the public.\"  There is no\n\nreason  to  think  that  the interest  of  individual  NEPOOL\n\nmembers is  synonymous with  the \"public\"  interest.  As  has\n\n                             -35-\n\nalready been noted,  FERC may  add conditions  to a  proposed\n\nmerger before granting approval.   16 U.S.C.   824b(b).   The\n\nstatute  does  not  require,  however,  that  FERC  establish\n\nconditions so  that every effect of an  approved merger could\n\nwithstand the \"public interest\" test.\n\n          At  a less  theoretical level,  the ALJ  determined\n\nthat the NEPOOL savings  \"were a vital  part of the long  and\n\nstrenuous negotiations which culminated in the resulting PSNH\n\nreorganization plan,\"  and  the particular  savings  of  $146\n\nmillion   for  New   Hampshire   consumers  were   relied  on\n\nspecifically by the  State of New Hampshire in  approving the\n\nmerged company's rate package.   53 F.E.R.C. at 65,213.   The\n\nCommission accepted this  finding of the  ALJ, while, at  the\n\nsame time, it reversed  the ALJ's decision to count  the $360\n\nmillion as  a benefit of the merger.   58 F.E.R.C. at 61,997.\n\nThe fact that  the cost-shift was not a benefit to be counted\n\nin weighing the  benefits and  costs of the  merger does  not\n\nmean that  the election of SPS and the concomitant cost-shift\n\nis not in  the public interest.   Election of  SPS is in  the\n\npublic interest because it is a central element of the merger\n\nplan  which, viewed  as  a whole,  was  found by  FERC  to be\n\nconsistent  with  the public  interest  based  on substantial\n\nevidence in the record.  We approve the Commission's decision\n\nnot to condition the merger on waiver by NU of SPS.\n\n     C.   Timing of Merger's Consummation.\n\n                             -36-\n\n          In  the  proceedings before  the  ALJ,  NU proposed\n\nfiling  a transmission  tariff within  60 days  following the\n\nmerger.  Intervenors and Commission staff proposed the filing\n\nand  approval of  an  interim  transmission  rate.   The  ALJ\n\nrejected  both proposals  and  instead held  that the  merger\n\nwould  be  consummated upon  the  filing  of NU's  compliance\n                                        \n\ntariff.  He reasoned as follows:\n\n          I see no  need for  requiring one  tariff\n          (with potential for controversy, charges,\n          collections and refunds)  to be  followed\n          by  yet  another  tariff,  with  its  own\n          potential for still other disputes.\n             Avoiding  a  transitional period  will\n          make   it   unnecessary   to  require   a\n          transitional  tariff.    To achieve  this\n          result, consummation of  the merger  must\n          be conditioned on  the concurrent  filing\n          of  a  compliance   tariff  which   fully\n          reflects all of  the terms and conditions\n          set out in this Initial Decision.  Such a\n          condition should encourage  a prompt  and\n          fair compliance filing  because NU  could\n          not begin  to  reap the  merger  benefits\n          without it.\n\n53 F.E.R.C. at 65,221.  The Commission concurred:\n\n             We    believe    the   GTC    [General\n          Transmission   Conditions]  and   the  NH\n          Corridor  Proposal,  as modified  herein,\n          adequately    mitigate    the    merger's\n          anticompetitive effects without requiring\n          the adoption of the Merger Tariff.  Trial\n          Staff stated that the Merger Tariff would\n          make  service available  immediately upon\n          approval of the merger.   We believe that\n          the presiding judge accomplished the same\n          result  by  allowing consummation  of the\n          merger  when  NU  submits its  compliance\n          filing.\n             We further believe  that delaying  the\n          merger's    consummation    until     the\n          Commission   accepts    NU's   compliance\n\n                             -37-\n\n          submittal    for    filing    would    be\n          inappropriate   given   the   uncertainty\n          surrounding    issues   which    may   be\n          challenged   and   subject   to   further\n          litigation  in the  compliance proceeding\n          and  given our  commitment to  act before\n          the Merger Agreement's December  31, 1991\n          termination date.  We believe that NU and\n          PSNH are  entitled to  a prompt and  fair\n          resolution  of this  proceeding.   At the\n          same time the intervenors are entitled to\n          have service begin as soon  as practical,\n          together  with a  fair resolution  of any\n          disputes raised regarding NU's compliance\n          filing.  Accordingly, we believe  that it\n          is in the best  interests of all  parties\n          to allow NU to consummate the merger when\n          it submits  its  compliance filing.    We\n          shall also require  NU to begin  honoring\n          such  requests  for transmission  service\n          under the  GTC,  as modified  herein,  at\n          that  time.    Such transmission  service\n          will be  provided at  either the firm  or\n          non-firm  transmission rates  proposed in\n          NU's   compliance   filing,  subject   to\n          refund, and  without a refund  floor.  In\n          reviewing    NU's   filing    to   ensure\n          compliance  with  this  Opinion, we  will\n          hold  NU to a very high  standard.  As NU\n          itself  states, \"[i]f NU  fails to comply\n          with  the  letter   or  spirit  of   such\n          [Commission]  requirement,  NU  would  be\n          subject to summary judgment  with respect\n          to any aspect of its compliance filing.\"\n\n56 F.E.R.C. at 62,025.\n\n          Petitioners'  stated concern  is that,  by allowing\n\nthe  merger to be consummated prior to FERC's approval of the\n\ncompliance tariff, FERC did not provide a sufficient guaranty\n\nthat NU would provide transmission access that would mitigate\n\n                             -38-\n\nthe  merger's  anticompetitive  effects.14    Petitioners  do\n\nnot, however,  seek  to unravel  the  merger.   Rather,  they\n\npropose that any  cost shift under the  NEPOOL Agreement, see\n                                                             \n\ndiscussion in  Part III(B),  supra, be postponed  until after\n                                  \n\nthe compliance tariff is approved.  Petitioners complain that\n\nthe course chosen by FERC creates an incentive on the part of\n\nNU  to delay  proceedings on  the compliance  tariff, thereby\n\nmaximizing  competitive  advantage.   Petitioners do  not, of\n\ncourse,  point  out  that  their  proposal  would  create  an\n\nincentive  on  their  part to  delay  final  approval of  the\n\ncompliance tariff, thereby postponing the day when the NEPOOL\n\ncost shift will take effect.\n\n          The ALJ and the Commission carefully considered the\n\nalternatives before reaching their decisions.  The Commission\n\nheld that the anticompetitive effects of the merger  would be\n\nadequately  mitigated  by  the  dual  requirements   that  NU\n\nimmediately provide  transmission access upon  the filing  of\n\nits compliance  tariff, and  that any  fees  collected by  NU\n\nwould be subject to  refund without a refund floor.   Because\n\nNU  accepted  these  merger conditions,  the  Commission  can\n\nenforce NU's  promise to pay  such refunds if  the Commission\n\nfinds them to be appropriate.

We  hold that\n       \n\nFERC's exercise  of its  discretion was not  inappropriate in\n\nthese  circumstances.   FERC  did not  defer, as  petitioners\n\nsuggest,  consideration of the anticompetitive effects of the\n\nmerger  which  FERC  itself   identified.    The   Commission\n\nrecognized the effects, and dealt with them in a reasoned way\n\nwhich  balanced  the  competing  interests  of  all  parties.\n\nFERC's remedy  is not  unreasonable, and we  therefore affirm\n\nits order.\n\n     D.   Protection of Native Load Customers.\n\n          1.   Priority of Services.\n                                   \n\n                             -40-\n\n               a.   Background.\n                              \n\n          In its  merger  application, NU  made  a  voluntary\n\ncommitment   to   provide  wholesale   transmission  service,\n\nincluding third  party wheeling  service,15  for any  utility\n\nover  its existing transmission system.  At the same time, NU\n\nsought  to limit  this  obligation by  reserving an  absolute\n\npriority  for  power  purchases  on  behalf  of  native  load\n\ncustomers (whose  power  needs NU  is bound  by franchise  or\n\ncontract  to  meet).   The  ALJ  held  that  although NU  may\n\nreasonably give  native load service  priority over  wheeling\n\nservice if NU's transmission system had insufficient capacity\n\nto serve both, 53  F.E.R.C. at 65,221-222, NU could  not deny\n\nfirm  wheeling   requests  based  upon  the   reservation  of\n\ntransmission  capacity for  its  own non-firm  sales, id.  at\n                                                         \n\n65,225.  \n\n          In Opinion  No.  364, the  Commission balanced  the\n\ninterests of  native load customers and  third party wheeling\n\ncustomers  and  affirmed  the  ALJ's denial  of  an  absolute\n\npriority:\n\n          we  .  . .  deny  NU's  proposal to  give\n          higher priority to  its own non-firm  use\n          than  to third  party  requests for  firm\n          wheeling    in     allocating    existing\n          transmission  capacity.    In  no  event,\n          however, will  NU be required  to provide\n          firm third party wheeling service  out of\n          existing   transmission   facilities   if\n\n                    \n\n15   For a definition of \"wheeling\" see n.9, supra.\n                                                  \n\n                             -41-\n\n          reliability  of  service  to native  load\n          customers would be adversely affected.\n\n56  F.E.R.C. at  62,021 (footnote  omitted).   The Commission\n\nfound it \"reasonable to allow NU to reserve firm transmission\n\ncapacity  to  provide reliable  service  to  its native  load\n                              \n\ncustomers.\"  Id. (Emphasis in original.)\n                \n\n          On rehearing,  NU asked the  Commission to  clarify\n\nthe  scope of  the \"reliability\"  criterion.   The Commission\n\n\"reiterate[d] that under no circumstances will NU be required\n\nto provide firm wheeling service out of existing transmission\n\ncapacity where  doing so would impair  or degrade reliability\n\nof  service to native load customers.\"  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,199\n\n(emphasis  removed).   The  Commission  held  the concept  of\n\nreliability generally  encompasses the:   (1) reservation  of\n\ntransmission capacity to back  up large generating units; (2)\n\nprovision of generation reserves; and (3) coverage of certain\n\nfuture  needs.     As  to  the  coverage   of  future  demand\n\nrequirements, the Commission  specifically ordered that  \"any\n\ncapacity needed for reliability purposes  within a reasonable\n\nplanning horizon  must be offered  for wheeling use  until NU\n\nexpects  to need the capacity  for reliability reasons.\"  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 61,199-200.\n\n          Petitioners assert  that the  decision to accord  a\n\npriority to native load  over transmission load is arbitrary,\n\ndiscriminatory, and  anticompetitive.   They argue  that FERC\n\nneither  defined  nor  justified  the   priority  granted  by\n\n                             -42-\n\nallowing reservation of transmission capacity for native load\n\nservice  and  that  any  such  priority  creates  competitive\n\nadvantages for  NU.  We  hold that the  Commission adequately\n\ndefined and reasonably justified its decision to allow such a\n\nreservation  and  properly   addressed  the   anticompetitive\n\nconcerns raised by the intervenors.  \n\n               b.   Discussion.\n                              \n\n          Although the Commission reaffirmed the general rule\n\nthat  firm transmission service  should be  accorded priority\n\nover  non-firm  service, even  if  the  latter would  benefit\n\nnative load,    it nonetheless  allowed  NU to  reserve  firm\n\ntransmission capacity  needed to ensure reliability of native\n\nload  service and allowed the  use of this  capacity for non-\n\nfirm transactions.  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,196.  Thus, native load\n\nservice will receive  a \"priority\" over third-party  wheeling\n\nservice  in  allocating existing  transmission  capacity when\n\nreliability  of service  to  native load  would be  adversely\n\naffected.     The  Commission  specifically   qualified  this\n\npriority by requiring NU  to offer the capacity  for wheeling\n\nuse until NU needed  it to assure reliability to  native load\n\ncustomers.\n\n          There  is nothing arbitrary or discriminatory about\n\nFERC's decision.  It struck  a reasonable balance between the\n\ncompeting interests of native load customers and  third-party\n\nwheeling customers.  NU-PSNH is obligated to serve its native\n\n                             -43-\n\nload  customers.  In return for this obligation to serve, the\n\nnative load customers regularly bear the cost of transmission\n\nfacilities;  native load  customers pay  for them,  use them,\n\nplan  on them, and rely on them.   As the ALJ noted, \"[e]very\n\nNew England utility favors  its own native load.   Nothing in\n\nthe NEPOOL agreement requires  its members to surrender their\n\nnative load preference, and none do.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,222.\n\nThus,  \"NU should be allowed  to give priority  over safe and\n\nreliable service to its  native load customers using existing\n\ntransmission capacity  built to  serve those customers.\"   58\n\nF.E.R.C. at  61,199.   FERC explicitly defined  and justified\n\nthe challenged native load \"priority.\"\n\n          2.   Transmission Upgrades Pricing.\n                                             \n\n               a.   Background.\n                              \n\n          NU's commitment to provide third-party transmission\n\nservice   includes   the  obligation   to   build  additional\n\ntransmission facilities as necessary to  relieve transmission\n\nconstraints on  its system.   58  F.E.R.C.  at 61,204-10;  56\n\nF.E.R.C. at 62,021-24.   The issue  then becomes, how  should\n\nthe  cost  of  constructing  such  transmission  upgrades  be\n\nallocated.  The ALJ stated  that questions of cost allocation\n\nare  best  addressed  in  future  proceedings  regarding  the\n\nparticular   responsibilities   for  particular   facilities.\n\nNevertheless,  the ALJ  adopted  the \"but  for\" analysis  for\n\ndetermining responsibility proposed by NU witness Schultheis:\n\n                             -44-\n\n          [W]heeling customers must make a pro rata\n          contribution   whenever  the   facilities\n          would  not have been  needed but  for the\n          wheeling  transfers across  a constrained\n          interface.   This means that  NU's native\n          load customers pay for the new facilities\n          they  create  the need  for  and wheeling\n          customers  pay  for  the facilities  they\n          create the need for.\n\n53 F.E.R.C. at 65,223.  The ALJ also noted that the financial\n\nexposure of  transmission customers  was limited by  the cost\n\ncaps  to  which NU  was committed.16    Id. at  65,224.   The\n                                           \n\nCommission agreed that cost  questions should be litigated in\n\nthe context of a specific proposal,  and accepted the concept\n\nof  the \"but for\" test  as a framework  for ascertaining cost\n\nresponsibility and the  use of  the proposed cost  caps as  a\n\nreasonable  means of  limiting  the  transmission  customers'\n\nresponsibility for  future upgrades.  56  F.E.R.C. at 62,028-\n\n030.   The Commission reaffirmed that  decision on rehearing.\n\n58 F.E.R.C. 61,204-207.\n\n          Petitioners  contend that the  Commission failed to\n\nadequately  explain  the pricing  policy  it  will employ  in\n\npricing  transmission upgrades.  Basically, petitioners claim\n\nthe ruling is too ambiguous to determine whether, or how, the\n\n                    \n\n16  NU committed  to cap  cost responsibility  to \"(1)  those\nspecific facilities  identified  by NU  at  the time  of  the\nwheeling request as needing to be built or upgraded either at\nthe time of the request or in the future; and (2) the maximum\ndollar  amount  contained  in  NU's  initial  estimate  of  a\nwheeling customer's pro  rata share  of the  costs of  future\nupgrades  needed  to  accommodate   a  request  for  wheeling\nservice.\"  \n56 F.E.R.C. at 62,031-32.\n\n                             -45-\n\nCommission changed its  policy from the traditional  \"rolled-\n\nin\" approach used  in pricing transmission service.   We hold\n\nthat   the  Commission   provided   a  clear   and   reasoned\n\njustification for  the principles that will  guide its future\n\ndeterminations of  transmission upgrade  pricing.  We  affirm\n\nthe Commission's decision not  to modify the basic principles\n\nadopted in its order.\n\n               b.   Discussion.\n                              \n\n          In accepting as reasonable  the \"but for\" test, the\n\nCommission  has  done no  more than  approve a  framework for\n\ndetermining  cost responsibility  which furthers  the general\n\nprinciple that  transmission costs  should be borne  by those\n\nentities  responsible  for the  cost.    58 F.E.R.C.  61,205.\n\nUnder  this test,  incremental  cost pricing  could be  found\n\nappropriate when firm wheeling across  a particular interface\n\nwould  degrade reliability absent  upgrades.   The Commission\n\nspecifically declined, however, to answer the requests of the\n\nintervenors  to  decide  the \"rolled-in  versus  incremental\"\n\nrate17 issue in  the abstract and  chose instead to  evaluate\n\nit only within the  context of a particular rate  proposal or\n\nupgrade.  Id.   The Commission articulated  how it envisioned\n             \n\n                    \n\n17  Under \"rolled  in\" pricing principles, the upgrade  costs\nwould  be rolled in with  other company costs  and charged to\nall ratepayers as part of NU's  general rate structure; while\nadministratively   simple,   it   ignores  any   concept   of\nresponsibility.  Thus, incremental pricing principles look to\nhold parties responsible for their share of upgrade costs.\n\n                             -46-\n\npricing  transmission  upgrades   and  adopted  a   condition\n\nlimiting  the  amount  NU  may  propose  to  collect  from  a\n\ntransmission customer to the greater of \n\n          (1) the incremental  cost of new  network\n          facilities  required  at  the   time  the\n          customer's new transmission load is added\n          or (2) the rolled-in cost of  all network\n          facilities required to serve the combined\n          transmission loads of [NU], including any\n          required transmission additions.\n\nId. at 61,206.   Thus, a wheeling customer may be charged the\n   \n\ngreater of rolled-in cost rates or incremental cost rates.   \n\n          The Commission acknowledged  that the  introduction\n\nof incremental  cost pricing  principles is a  departure from\n\nits  traditional pricing  policies18 and  justified  this new\n\npolicy  on NU's  unprecedented  obligation  to provide  third\n\nparty transmission service.   Id.  The  Commission noted that\n                                 \n\nincremental  cost  pricing  may  be  appropriate  in  certain\n\ncircumstances,  but  decided to  leave  the  details of  cost\n\nresponsibility  questions to  a  future specific  section 205\n\nrate case.  When such a  case arises, NU will bear the burden\n\nof   justifying  \"any   direct  assignments   of   costs  and\n\nsupport[ing] any arguments that  reliability is degraded by a\n\nparticular  firm transmission  service.    No presumption  is\n\n                    \n\n18     The  Commission generally  has  adhered to  rolled  in\npricing,   but  has   never  precluded   particularized  cost\nallocations to  specific  customers where  appropriate.   See\n                                                             \nUtah Power &amp; Light Co., 45 F.E.R.C.   61,095, at 61,291 n.163\n                      \n(1988);  Public Service Co. of Indiana, 51 F.E.R.C.   61,367,\n                                      \nat 62,203 (1990).\n\n                             -47-\n\ncreated  by  NU's  `but  for' criterion  that  firm  wheeling\n\ncustomers always cause the need for upgrades.\"  Id. at 61,207\n                                                   \n\n(quoting 56 F.E.R.C. at 62031).   The Commission also allowed\n\nthat  any  reliance by  NU  upon the  \"but  for\" test  may be\n\nchallenged in  future actions.   The Commission  sufficiently\n\nexplained and  justified the  principles that will  guide its\n\ntransmission upgrade pricing.\n\n     E.   Opportunity Cost Pricing.\n\n          As has already been discussed, the Commission found\n\nit necessary to impose a number of conditions on the proposed\n\nNU-PSNH merger to mitigate  the merged company's market power\n\nin the  markets for  transmission and short-term  bulk power.\n\n58 F.E.R.C.  at 61,195.    Specifically, the  Commission held\n\nthat  NU  must  provide  firm  transmission  service  out  of\n\nexisting  capacity  for  any   utility,  subject  only  to  a\n\nreservation  of  sufficient  capacity  to  maintain  reliable\n\nservice to its  native load customers  and to honor  existing\n\ncontractual obligations.   NU was  prohibited, however,  from\n\ndenying a request for  firm transmission service by reserving\n\ncapacity for  non-firm transactions  that would enable  it to\n\nprovide more economical service to its native load customers.\n\n56 F.E.R.C.  at 62,014-21;  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,196-200.   FERC\n\nalso  held   that  NU  must  build   additional  transmission\n\nfacilities   as   needed   to   provide   transmission  where\n\ninsufficient capacity  exists.  56 F.E.R.C.  at 62,021-24; 58\n\n                             -48-\n\nF.E.R.C. at 61,204-10.   The Commission found that  these and\n\nother conditions  would  \"adequately mitigate\"  the  merger's\n\nanticompetitive effects.  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,213.\n\n          On rehearing, NU and  the States of Connecticut and\n\nNew Hampshire  argued that the Commission  should address the\n\nissue of  firm transmission  pricing because, in  Opinion No.\n\n364, FERC  had established  principles governing  the related\n\nissue of  firm transmission priority which  made NU's ability\n\nto purchase  inexpensive power (which would lower its cost of\n\nserving  its  native  load  customers)  subordinate  to   its\n\nobligation  to provide  firm transmission for  third parties.\n\n58  F.E.R.C.  at  61,201-02.    The  Commission  agreed,  but\n\ndeclined  to approve  \"opportunity  cost  pricing\"19  outside\n\nthe  context of  a specific  tariff proposal.   Instead,  the\n\nCommission announced three \"basic  goals\" to guide its future\n\ndecisions on the  pricing of firm transmission service on the\n\nmerged company's existing capacity, and left the door open to\n\nNU  to propose  a tariff  based on  opportunity costs  or any\n\n                    \n\n19   As the Commission explained, opportunity costs\n          are the  revenues lost or  costs incurred\n          by  a  utility  in providing  third-party\n          transmission  service  when  transmission\n          capacity is insufficient to  satisfy both\n          a  third-party  wheeling request  and the\n          utility's   own   use.     For   example,\n          opportunity   costs  might   include  the\n          revenues lost or costs incurred because a\n          utility  must  reduce its  own off-system\n          purchases or sales in order to overcome a\n          constraint on the [transmission] grid.\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,200-201.\n\n                             -49-\n\nother  methodology  that would  meet  the three  goals.   The\n\nCommission explained its decision as follows:\n\n            We are now confronted with the need  to\n          provide   NU   with  enough   specificity\n          regarding  what it  will  be  allowed  to\n          propose for the  pricing of future third-\n          party  wheeling  service,  so   that  the\n          company  can  decide  whether to  proceed\n          with the  merger.  We also  cannot ignore\n          the  need  to  act  as  expeditiously  as\n          possible  given the  commercial realities\n          and time pressures presented in corporate\n          matters subject to our  jurisdiction, and\n          in  particular  the  need  to  resolve  a\n          bankruptcy situation.   At the  same time\n          we are confronted with the need to ensure\n          an  adequate record on pricing issues and\n          to   afford   all  parties   an  adequate\n          opportunity to voice their objections.\n            Balancing  these  respective needs,  we\n          conclude  that  the  best  course  is  to\n          provide guidance on  pricing issues,  but\n          to defer specific  pricing issues to  the\n          compliance phase of  this proceeding,  or\n          to subsequent cases where  the Commission\n          may consider specific  proposals from  NU\n          in a concrete, factual setting and with a\n          more developed record.\n          . . . .\n          First, the  native load customers  of the\n                                                   \n          utility  providing  transmission  service\n                                                   \n          should   be   held  harmless.     Second,\n                                                   \n          transmission customers  should be charged\n                                                   \n          the lowest reasonable cost-based rate for\n                                                   \n          third-party transmission service.  Third,\n                                                   \n          the pricing should prevent the collection\n                                                   \n          of  monopoly  rents  by the  transmission\n                                                   \n          owner and  promote efficient transmission\n                                                   \n          decisions.      In  ruling   on  specific\n                   \n          proposed  rates,  we  will balance  these\n          three  goals  in light  of the  facts and\n          circumstances presented at that time.   \n\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,203 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).\n\n          FERC  was careful  to  point out  that it  endorsed\n\nopportunity cost pricing  only insofar as NU  could show that\n\n                             -50-\n\nit could \"propose rates which  include legitimate, verifiable\n\nopportunity costs.\"  Id.   The Commission warned NU  that any\n                        \n\nsuch  proposal would  be carefully  scrutinized and  would be\n\nsubject to challenge.  Id. at 61,203-04.  Specifically,  FERC\n                          \n\nstated that  NU would  have to  address the  following issues\n\nshould it seek recovery of opportunity costs:\n\n          (1) whether opportunity  costs should  be\n          capped by incremental expansion  costs or\n          any  other  cap;   (2)  whether   current\n          wheeling   and   wholesale   requirements\n          customers  should be  treated differently\n          from   future   wheeling  and   wholesale\n          requirements    customers,    e.g.,    by\n                                            \n          receiving    \"grandfather\"   rights    to\n          embedded cost  rates  for the  amount  of\n          transmission  capacity they  already use;\n          (3) how NU  will identify those customers\n          responsible for growth on its  system and\n          what   particular   new  facilities   are\n          necessary to accommodate that growth; (4)\n          whether  and how third  parties should be\n          protected   from   uncertainty  regarding\n          fluctuations  in  opportunity costs;  (5)\n          how  the proposed rates  will prevent the\n          collection of monopoly rents; and (6) how\n          the  proposed  opportunity costs  will be\n          verified.\n\nId.    The Commission  expressly  postponed consideration  of\n   \n\nwhether opportunity cost pricing  would be inconsistent  with\n\nnondiscriminatory  pricing  and  nondiscriminatory terms  and\n\nconditions of  service until  those issues  were raised  in a\n\nconcrete factual context.  Id. at 61,204, n.118.\n                              \n\n          Petitioners claim that FERC's decision  amounted to\n\nan arbitrary endorsement of opportunity cost pricing that was\n\nnot  supported  by evidence  in  the  record, was  inherently\n\n                             -51-\n\ndiscriminatory, and contrary to FERC's  regulation of natural\n\ngas pipelines.   Petitioners' underlying concern  seems to be\n\nthat  when  the  issue arises  next  in  the  context of  the\n\nCommission's  review  of NU's  compliance  tariff, FERC  will\n\nsimply approve the tariff and dismiss petitioners' objections\n\non the  ground that  opportunity cost pricing  principles had\n\nalready  been  endorsed  by  the  Commission.    Although  we\n\nunderstand petitioners' concerns,  we believe  that they  are\n\nmisplaced and that FERC did not go as far as petitioners fear\n\nin endorsing opportunity cost pricing.\n\n          Petitioners will have an opportunity to contest any\n\ncompliance tariff proposed by NU.  The Commission itself laid\n\nout a number of issues which NU would have to address were it\n\nto  propose a tariff based on opportunity costs.  58 F.E.R.C.\n\nat 61,203.   Only  after carefully considering  the competing\n\ninterests of providing  guidance to  NU as to  what kinds  of\n\ntariffs it would consider, and  the need to endorse  specific\n\nmethodologies only on the  basis of a fully-developed record,\n\ndid  the Commission  decide  to outline  broad pricing  goals\n\nwhich would allow  for a number of pricing  schemes including\n\nopportunity  cost pricing.  Id.   It was  squarely within the\n                               \n\nCommission's  power  to defer  consideration  of petitioners'\n\nassertions until  after NU filed  its compliance tariff.   As\n\nthe  Supreme  Court  has  held,  \"[a]n  agency  enjoys  broad\n\ndiscretion in determining how  to handle related yet discrete\n\n                             -52-\n\nissues  in  terms  of  procedures, and  priorities.\"    Mobil\n                                                             \n\nExploration   &amp;   Producing   Southeast,   Inc.   v.

Petitioners argue that deferral was inappropriate\n\nin this case because  their objections went \"to the  heart of\n\nthe  public interest  determination  to be  made.\"   Maryland\n                                                             \n\nPeople's Counsel v.

The Commission remains  free to,\n\nand  we expect it will, invite  objections to NU's compliance\n\ntariff from  affected parties,  and will reject  any proposed\n\ntariff that  conflicts with its  statutory responsibility  to\n\napprove rates  that are \"just and reasonable,\" and to approve\n\nmergers that are, as conditioned, \"consistent with the public\n\ninterest.\"\n\n     F.   Environmental Impact Statement.\n\n          The  City of  Holyoke  Gas  &amp;  Electric  Department\n\n(\"HG&amp;E\") alleges that FERC's refusal to examine the potential\n\nenvironmental  impacts  of its  approval  of  the merger  was\n\narbitrary and capricious.  We disagree.\n\n                             -53-\n\n          The National Environmental  Policy Act of 1969,  42\n\nU.S.C.    4321 et seq., (\"NEPA\") requires federal agencies to\n                      \n\nconsider the  potential environmental effects  of a  proposed\n\nmajor  federal  action  that  may  significantly  affect  the\n\nquality of the human environment.

Agencies  were authorized,  under\n\nguidelines  promulgated  by  the  Council   on  Environmental\n\nQuality (\"CEQ\"), to create categorical exclusions for actions\n\nwhich do not individually  or cumulatively have a significant\n\neffect  on  the human  environment.    40  C.F.R.     1507.3,\n\n1508.4.    FERC  adopted   such  a  category  of  exclusions,\n\n                             -54-\n\nincluding one for merger  approvals such as the one  at issue\n\nin this case.  That regulation states in pertinent part:\n\n          (a) General  rule.  Except  as stated  in\n          paragraph (b) of this section, neither an\n          environmental    assessment    nor     an\n          environmental  impact  statement will  be\n          prepared  for  the following  projects or\n          actions:\n          . . . .\n            (16) Approval of actions under sections\n          4(b), 203, 204, 301,  304, and 305 of the\n          Federal  Power  Act relating  to issuance\n          and  purchase of  securities, acquisition\n          or   disposition  of   property,  merger,\n          interlocking directorates, jurisdictional\n          determinations and accounting orders.\n\n18  C.F.R.    380.4(a)(16).

HG&amp;E also  cites\n\nFERC's  decision  in  Southern   California  Edison  Co.,  49\n                                                        \n\nF.E.R.C.     61,091  (1989)   (holding  that    380.4(b)  was\n\ntriggered when approved merger would result in the dumping of\n\n                    \n\n20  HG&amp;E  does  not challenge  the  validity  of  any of  the\napplicable regulations cited above.\n\n                             -56-\n\nhundreds of tons of additional air contaminants into the most\n\npolluted air in the United States).\n\n          There was no evidence in the record of identifiable\n\nenvironmental harms that would likely result from the NU-PSNH\n\nmerger.  The  fact that new generating  facilities might wind\n\nup  in different locations than  would have been  the case in\n\nthe absence of  the merger does not approach in significance,\n\nbecause  its  significance  is  not quantifiable,  the  known\n\neffects of  the  merger between  Southern  California  Edison\n\nCompany  and San  Diego Gas  &amp; Electric  Company.   Thus, the\n\nfactual  situation presented in Southern California Edison is\n                                                          \n\ncompletely distinguishable from that of this case.\n\n          The   character  and   location   of   the   future\n\nenvironmental effects of the  NU-PSNH merger are so uncertain\n\nthat  no  meaningful  environmental  review would  have  been\n\npossible, even had  FERC made the effort.  Here, FERC was not\n\napproving  a  regional  development  plan.    It  was  merely\n\napproving a merger between utility companies, albeit a merger\n\ninvolving  two  of  the  largest utilities  in  New  England.\n\nEnergy  demand may increase in New England over the following\n\ndecades, and the fact  of the merger may influence  how those\n\nneeds  are met.  Nevertheless, any attempt by FERC to prepare\n\nan  EIS would  have involved  little more  than spinning  out\n\nmultiple  hypothetical  development forecasts,  with multiple\n\noptions  for   the  type,  amount  and   location  of  future\n\n                             -57-\n\ngenerating facilities.

Once concrete plans have been established\n\nfor   the   construction   of  transmission   or   generating\n\nfacilities, those  proposals will  be reviewed under  NEPA or\n\nthe applicable state environmental review procedures.\n\n          FERC  was justified  in  deciding  that neither  an\n\nenvironmental   assessment   nor   an  environmental   impact\n\nstatement was required prior to approving the NU-PSNH merger.\n\n     G.   HG&amp;E's \"Unique\" Harm.\n\n          HG&amp;E also  contends that because it  relied on PSNH\n\nNew Hampshire  Corridor facilities for over  one-third of its\n\nelectricity supply,  it would be \"uniquely  threatened\" by NU\n\nin head-to-head competition for  large, industrial loads.  To\n\nprotect    itself,   HG&amp;E   requested   that   FERC   either:\n\n(1) disapprove  the merger;  (2) require  the  divestiture or\n\nrestructuring of  NU's retail  business in Holyoke  (HWP); or\n\n(3) grant  HG&amp;E  grandfather  rights to  PSNH  New  Hampshire\n\nCorridor transmission.  The ALJ rejected the \"drastic remedy\"\n\nof divestiture of HWP, stating that it was  \"wholly uncalled-\n\nfor  by anything in this record,\" and holding that HG&amp;E would\n\nbe  adequately  protected by  the  conditions  to the  merger\n\ndesigned   to   address   the  anticompetitive   effects   on\n\ntransmission dependent  utilities (\"TDUs\").   53  F.E.R.C. at\n\n65,232.\n\n          As the ALJ described,\n\n                             -58-\n\n          [t]he  Transmission  Dependent  Utilities\n          (TDUs) are  \"entirely dependent on  NU or\n          PSNH  for  their bulk  power transmission\n          needs.\"  These  companies (most of  which\n          involve municipal ownership) are  not big\n          enough  to  own  or construct  sufficient\n          generation to meet their loads.

Absent  economic access to NU's\n          or  PSNH's  transmission facilities,  the\n          TDU  cannot  survive  as  an  independent\n          entity.\"   The  TDUs compete with  NU and\n          PSNH in the wholesale bulk  power market;\n          each   TDU,   like  NU/PSNH,   seeks  out\n          attractive sources of  supply.  TDUs thus\n          \"are in  the  uneasy position  of  having\n          their    only    source   of    essential\n          transmission  service  in  the  hands  of\n          their principal competitor.\"  These small\n          companies,    uniquely    vulnerable   to\n          possible  anticompetitive   conduct,  are\n          entitled  to  some measure  of protective\n          assurance regarding NU/PSNH's post merger\n          conduct.\n\n53  F.E.R.C. at 65,232-33.   The ALJ held  that \"[a]ll rates,\n\nterms and  conditions of NU/PSNH transmission  service to the\n\nTDUs in effect  on this date shall . .  . be maintained after\n\nthe merger,  unless and until changes are  either agreed upon\n\nby  the merged  company and  the TDUs,  or authorized  by the\n\nCommission.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,233.  In short, while finding\n\nthat  TDUs  were  \"uniquely  vulnerable\"  to  anticompetitive\n\nconduct by NU-PSNH,  the ALJ  found that HG&amp;E  had not  shown\n\nthat  it was  entitled to  protections beyond those  given to\n\nTDUs  generally.    The  Commission agreed,  56  F.E.R.C.  at\n\n62,049,  but bolstered the protection for TDUs ordered by the\n\n                             -59-\n\nALJ by imposing the additional condition  that NU establish a\n\nspecial tariff for TDUs.  Id. at 62,050.\n                             \n\n          HG&amp;E  points  to  no  evidence  in  the  record  to\n\nindicate  that it  faced anticompetitive consequences  of the\n\nmerger sufficiently  different in  character or magnitude  to\n\nwarrant greater  protections than those given  to other TDUs.\n\nWe therefore affirm the Commission's actions to protect TDUs,\n\nwhich were adequately explained and supported in the record.\n\n     H.

The ALJ interpreted\n\nthat holding as follows:\n\n          The  Commission  made clear  that  in the\n          particular circumstances  surrounding the\n          Seabrook  contract,  it  retains power   \n          through the \"public interest\"  language  \n          to    make   modifications    under   the\n          traditional   just  and   reasonable  and\n          nondiscrimination standards.\n\n53 F.E.R.C.  at  65,235.   The  standard established  by  the\n\nCommission, and  subsequently applied by  the ALJ,  conflates\n\nthe  \"just and  reasonable\" and \"public  interest\" standards,\n\nthereby  circumventing  the  Mobile-Sierra  doctrine.     The\n                                          \n\ndistinction  between the  \"just and  reasonable\" and  \"public\n\ninterest\"  standards  loses  its   meaning  entirely  if  the\n\nCommission may  modify a  contract under the  public interest\n\nstandard  where it  finds  the contract  \"may be  unjust [or]\n\nunreasonable.\"   The  parties'  express intent  was to  avoid\n\nreview  of  rate  schedules  under the  just  and  reasonable\n\nstandard.    Mobile-Sierra protects  their  right  to do  so,\n                          \n\nleaving the Commission  with the power  to modify rates  only\n\nwhen required by the public interest.\n\n                             -63-\n\n          The  Commission  found that  the  SPC  might unduly\n\ndiscriminate  against entities not  parties to  the contract,\n\nand that there was no genuine arm's-length bargaining because\n\nNU and PSNH negotiated the agreement at a time when they knew\n\nthey were about to  merge and have identical interests.   The\n\nCommission held  that, in  this context, it  could \"carefully\n\nscrutinize the  rates, terms and conditions  of the contract\"\n\nto determine if they were just.  Id.\n                                    \n\n          The Commission's  explanation for employing  a just\n\nand  reasonable  standard seems  to  us inadequate.    To the\n\nextent  the  Commission   is  relying  on   NU's  prospective\n\nownership of PSNH, it is unclear why the Commission should be\n\nconcerned    about   protecting   PSNH   from   a   perceived\n\ndisadvantageous arrangement imposed by its  prospective owner\n\nsince any disadvantage visited on  the prospective subsidiary\n\nwill be borne by its owner.  If NU chooses  to allocate risks\n\namong its operating subsidiaries  and one of its subsidiaries\n\nis  disfavored in  this calculation,  there would seem  to be\n\nlittle justification for the Commission stepping in on behalf\n\nof the disfavored subsidiary absent some threat to the public\n\ninterest.\n\n          As for the seller's  market power, reliance on this\n\nfactor  threatens  to  erode  the  Mobile-Sierra doctrine  so\n                                                \n\nsubstantially that  a fuller explanation  from the Commission\n\nis required before  proceeding down this  route.  After  all,\n\n                             -64-\n\nsome  measure of  market power  could be  present in  a large\n\nnumber  of  contracts.    A  case-by-case  inquiry  into  the\n\npresence  and extent of market  power would inject  a new and\n\npotentially  time-consuming  element  into the  Mobile-Sierra\n                                                             \n\nanalysis, and it is not entirely  clear in any event why  the\n\nCommission should protect a buyer who voluntarily enters into\n\nan agreement with a dominant seller.\n\n          The  most attractive case  for affording additional\n\nprotection, despite  the presence of a contract, is where the\n\nprotection is  intended to  safeguard the interests  of third\n\nparties,  notably the  buyer's customers.   The Mobile-Sierra\n                                                             \n\ndoctrine itself allows  for intervention by FERC  where it is\n\nshown  that the  interests of  third parties  are threatened.\n\nMobile,  350  U.S.  at  344-45;  Sierra,  350  U.S.  at  355.\n                                       \n\nHowever, the  standard to be  applied, as  formulated by  the\n\nSupreme  Court, is  the  protection of  outside parties  from\n\n\"undu[e] discriminat[ion]\"  or  imposition of  an  \"excessive\n\nburden.\"  Sierra,  350 U.S. at 355.  If  there is some reason\n                \n\nfor departing from this public interest standard as framed by\n\nthe Supreme Court, the Commission has not supplied it.\n\n          We  assume, without  deciding, that:   (1)  FERC is\n\ncorrect  in its assertion that the State of New Hampshire did\n\nnot adequately represent the  interests of non-parties to the\n\ncontract,  and  that,  therefore,  the SPC  may  have  unduly\n\ndiscriminated  against those non-parties; and (2) the alleged\n\n                             -65-\n\nlack of arms'-length bargaining among NU,  PSNH and the State\n\nof  New Hampshire gave  the Commission the  right to evaluate\n\nthe SPC.  We hold, however,  that the Commission was bound to\n\nfollow  the Mobile-Sierra  doctrine as explicated  by Papago,\n                                                            \n\nand therefore should have evaluated  the SPC under the public\n\ninterest standard, not the just and reasonable standard.\n\n          We  therefore remand this issue for reconsideration\n                              \n\nby FERC under the public interest standard.24\n\nIV.

The Holyoke  Gas &amp;\n\nElectric Department (\"Holyoke\")  argues that FERC  erred when\n\nit  failed  to:   (1) conduct  an  appropriate review  of the\n\nenvironmental impact  of the  proposed merger; and,  (2) make\n\nfindings    regarding    allegations    of    anticompetitive\n\nconsequences  of  the merger  that  were  unique to  Holyoke.\n\nFinally,  Northeast  Utilities   Service  Company   (\"NUSCO\")\n\nasserts that FERC's orders  changing the terms of  three rate\n\nschedules  filed in  conjunction with its  merger application\n\nwere arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.\n\n          For   the   reasons   which   follow,   we   reject\n\npetitioners' arguments and affirm the  Commission's decisions\n\nwith the exception of the Commission's decision to change the\n\nterms  of the  Seabrook Power  Contract which  we  remand for\n\nconsideration under the \"public interest\" standard.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND.\n\n     A.   Parties to the Approved Merger.\n\n          Northeast  Utilities (\"NU\") is a registered holding\n\ncompany under the Public Utility Holding Company  Act of 1935\n\n(PUHCA).  15 U.S.C.   79 et seq. (1988).  Northeast Utilities\n                                \n\nService Company (\"NUSCO\") is  a service company subsidiary of\n\n                             -7-\n\nNU   and  supplies  centralized  administrative  and  support\n\nservices to NU's operating companies.27\n\n          Prior to the merger,  Public Service Company of New\n\nHampshire (\"PSNH\")  was the  largest electric utility  in New\n\nHampshire, supplying  electric service to some 375,000 retail\n\ncustomers,  approximately  three-quarters   of  the   State's\n\npopulation, in every county in the State.  PSNH also provided\n\nwholesale service to the New  Hampshire Electric Cooperative,\n\nthree  New Hampshire  municipalities, and  one investor-owned\n\nutility,  Vermont  Electric  Power  Company.   PSNH  had  the\n\nlargest  ownership  share,  approximately  35.6  percent,  of\n\nSeabrook Unit  No. 1, a nuclear  generating facility declared\n\nto be available for service on June 30, 1990.\n\n     B.   The Merger Proposal.\n\n          On  January  28,  1988,  PSNH   filed  a  voluntary\n\npetition  in  the  United  States Bankruptcy  Court  for  the\n\nDistrict of New Hampshire for reorganization under Chapter 11\n\nof  the Bankruptcy Code.   11 U.S.C.    1101 et  seq. (1988).\n                                                     \n\nPSNH  alleged that it was unable to  recover in its rates the\n\noutlays  it had made in the construction and operation of the\n\nSeabrook  nuclear power  plant.   On  April  20, 1990,  after\n\n                    \n\n27   NU's operating companies are Connecticut Light and Power\nCompany  (CL&amp;P),  Western  Massachusetts   Electric  Company,\nHolyoke  Water  Power  Company (HWP)  and  HWP's wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, Holyoke Power and Electric Company (HP&amp;E).  These\ncompanies are wholly-owned subsidiaries  of NU and are public\nutilities supplying retail and wholesale electric service  in\nConnecticut and Massachusetts.\n\n                             -8-\n\nsifting through several  competing reorganization plans,  the\n\nbankruptcy court  approved NU's  proposal to merge  with PSNH\n\nand to  acquire and operate  all of PSNH's  power facilities.\n\nSee In re Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, 963  F.2d 469,\n                                             \n\n470 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, Rochman v. Northeast Utilities\n                                                             \n\nService Co., 113 S. Ct. 304 (1992).\n           \n\n          NU's proposal contained a two-step process:  first,\n\nPSNH would  emerge from  bankruptcy as a  stand-alone company\n\nbound  to a merger agreement  with NU; second,  PSNH would be\n\nmerged  with   an  NU  subsidiary  created   solely  for  the\n\nacquisition (NU Acquisition Corporation), with  PSNH emerging\n\nas  the surviving entity.  After  the merger, PSNH would be a\n\nwholly-owned  subsidiary   of  NU  and  would   transfer  its\n\nownership  interest   in  Seabrook  to  a   newly  formed  NU\n\nsubsidiary,   North   Atlantic  Energy   Corporation  (\"North\n\nAtlantic\").    The second  step  would occur  only  after all\n\nnecessary  approvals   were   received  from   the   relevant\n\nregulatory agencies.\n\n     C.   Procedural History.\n\n          On January 8, 1990, NUSCO, on behalf of NU and NU's\n\noperating subsidiaries, filed an  application with FERC under\n\nsection 203 of  the Federal  Power Act (\"FPA\"),  16 U.S.C.   \n\n824b (1988), seeking authorization for PSNH to dispose of all\n\nof its  jurisdictional facilities and  concurrently to  merge\n\nwith, and become  a subsidiary  of, NU.   In connection  with\n\n                             -9-\n\nthis application,  NUSCO filed four rate  schedules with FERC\n\npursuant  to     205   of  the  FPA:    the   Seabrook  Power\n\nContract,28   the  Sharing   Agreement29  and   two  Capacity\n\nInterchange Agreements.30\n\n          The  Commission  consolidated consideration  of the\n\nmerger  application and  rate  schedules,  accepted the  rate\n\nschedules for  filing and suspended their  effectiveness, and\n\nset for  hearings before an administrative  law judge (\"ALJ\")\n\nthe questions  of whether the  Commission should grant  the  \n\n203  application  and  approve   the  rate  schedules.    See\n                                                             \n\nNortheast Utilities Service Co.,  50 F.E.R.C.   61,266, reh'g\n                                                             \n\ngranted  in part  and denied  in part,  51 F.E.R.C.    61,177\n                                     \n\n(1990).  In its order, the Commission directed the parties to\n\n                    \n\n28  The Seabrook  Power Contract is a  life-of-the-unit power\nsales agreement between PSNH  and North Atlantic entered into\nconcurrently with  NU's acquisition of PSNH  and the transfer\nof PSNH's share  of Seabrook  to North Atlantic.   Under  the\ncontract, PSNH  agreed  to purchase  North Atlantic's  entire\nshare of Seabrook capacity and  energy, according to a  cost-\nof-service formula rate.  The contract was intended to ensure\nthat  North Atlantic would recover all of its costs from PSNH\nregardless of whether or not Seabrook actually operated.\n\n29   The Sharing Agreement allocates the benefits and obliga-\ntions from the  integrated operation of PSNH and  the current\nNU  system, as well as  the joint planning  and operations of\nthese  systems.   This  agreement established  a formula  for\nsharing the  expected post-merger benefits that  would accrue\nto NU and PSNH  operating companies as a result  of operating\nefficiencies  and  the  ability  to take  single  participant\nstatus under the NEPOOL agreement.\n\n30    The two Capacity Interchange Agreements provide for the\nsale  and purchase  of  energy between  PSNH and  Connecticut\nLight &amp; Power Company (CL&amp;P) over a ten-year term.\n\n                             -10-\n\naddress  the  effect of  the proposed  merger on  NU's market\n\npower and \"whether any transmission conditions  are necessary\n\nto eliminate any  adverse effect of the  proposed merger and,\n\nif  so,  what specific  conditions  should be  imposed.\"   50\n\nF.E.R.C. at 61,834-35.\n\n          On December  20, 1990,  the ALJ issued  its Initial\n\nDecision  approving  the     203  application  and  the  rate\n\nschedules   with   certain   modifications  and   conditions.\n\nNortheast Utilities Service Co., 53 F.E.R.C.   63,020 (1990).\n                               \n\nThe Commission, in Opinion No. 364, issued on August 9, 1991,\n\naffirmed in  part and  reversed in part  the ALJ's  decision,\n\nconditionally approving  the    203 application and  the rate\n\nschedules.

On  January 29,  1992,  after  considering\n\nadditional  filings  by  the  parties and  oral  argument  on\n\ntransmission  pricing issues,  the Commission  issued Opinion\n\nNo. 364-A,  affirming its  conditional approval of  the   203\n\napplication  and rate schedules.

The  Judicial   Panel  on   Multidistrict\n\nLitigation  consolidated these petitions  for review  in this\n\ncourt, where  further petitions for  review were  filed.   28\n\nU.S.C.   2112(a) (1988).  Subsequently, in Opinion No. 364-B,\n\n                             -11-\n\nthe Commission denied a request for  rehearing of Opinion No.\n\n364-A.

A petition for review of Opinions No. 364-A and 364-\n\nB was filed in this court, where it was consolidated with the\n\nearlier filed  petitions.  We review  the Commission's orders\n\nunder the jurisdiction established by 16 U.S.C.   825l.\n\nII.

Background.\n                         \n\n          In reaching  his  decision to  approve the  NU-PSNH\n\nmerger,  the   ALJ  found  that  the   merger  would  produce\n\nsignificant benefits.  Specifically, he found that:  (1) PSNH\n\nwould emerge from bankruptcy  as a viable utility on  a solid\n\nfinancial  footing,  53  F.E.R.C.  at  65,211;  (2)  improved\n\nmanagement techniques and economies of scale would reduce the\n\noperating costs  of Seabrook by  some $527 million,31  id. at\n                                                          \n\n65,212; (3) application of NU operating procedures  to PSNH's\n\nfossil steam plants would save  $100 million, id. at  65,213;\n                                                 \n\n(4) reductions in  administrative and general  expenses would\n\nsave  $124  million, id.;  (5) NU's  record of  buying lower-\n                        \n\npriced coal on the  spot market would save $39  million, id.;\n                                                            \n\nand (6) the merger would yield $360 million in savings for NU\n\nbecause of  its ability to elect  \"single participant status\"\n\n                    \n\n31    This,  and all  other  dollar amounts  are net  present\nvalues unless otherwise noted.\n\n                             -13-\n\nin  the  New  England  Power  Pool  (NEPOOL),  a  power  pool\n\ncomprised of most of the utilities in New England.

Under the  authority of   203(b)  of the FPA, 16\n\nU.S.C.    824b(b), the  ALJ  approved the  merger subject  to\n\nseveral conditions, including the  following:  (1) the merged\n\ncompany  must  offer  firm  (non-interruptible)  transmission\n\nservice  for a minimum of 30 days  and a maximum of 20 years,\n\n53  F.E.R.C.  at  65,220-21;  (2) non-firm  service  must  be\n\noffered  for a one-day minimum  term, id. at  65,220; (3) the\n                                         \n\nmerger would be consummated concurrently with the filing of a\n\ncompliance tariff which fully reflects  all of the terms  and\n\nconditions set  out in  the ALJ's  Initial  Decision, id.  at\n                                                         \n\n65,221;  (4) NU  must  implement its  New Hampshire  Corridor\n\nProposal,32 thereby  making available 400 MW  of transmission\n\n                    \n\n32   The New Hampshire  Corridor Transmission Proposal allows\nNew  England  utilities  to purchase  long-term  transmission\nrights from NU-PSNH in order to connect with power sources in\nnorthern New England and Canada.

It held,  however, that the $364 million  cost-shift\n\nbetween NU-PSNH and other NEPOOL members should not have been\n\ncounted  as a benefit of the merger because it simply shifted\n\ncosts dollar-for-dollar  among the membership without any net\n\nsavings.34    56 F.E.R.C.  at  61,997.   The  Commission also\n\nheld  that,  in evaluating  the  costs  and benefits  of  the\n\nmerger, the ALJ  correctly attributed the benefits  resulting\n\nfrom  the merger to the  merger even if  those benefits could\n\nhave been  achieved  by other  means.35   Id.  at  61,994-96.\n                                             \n\nThis conclusion  was reiterated  on rehearing in  Opinion No.\n\n364-A.  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,186-87.\n\n                    \n\n33   \"Wheeling\" is defined as the \"transfer by direct trans-\nmission or displacement [of]  electric power from one utility\nto another  over the facilities of  an intermediate utility.\"\nOtter Tail Power Co. v.

Discussion.\n                         \n\n          Petitioners make two claims  with regard to  FERC's\n\nevaluation  of the costs and benefits  of the NU-PSNH merger.\n\nFirst,  they  argue  that  the  Commission  should  not  have\n\nincluded resolution of PSNH's bankruptcy as a  benefit of the\n\nmerger because:  (1) PSNH actually emerged from bankruptcy on\n\nMay 16, 1991, the  effective date of the  Reorganization Plan\n\n(\"RP\");  and  (2) prior  to  gaining  the bankruptcy  court's\n\napproval  of the two-step RP, PSNH  had to show that it would\n\nbe  financially  viable  as   a  stand-alone  entity  because\n\nregulatory approval  for the  second step  of the  RP (merger\n\nwith and into NU) was not assured.  These two facts, however,\n\ndo not  imply that  it was  error for  FERC  to consider  the\n\n\"resolution of PSNH's bankruptcy\" as  a benefit, indeed as  a\n\nprincipal benefit, of the merger.  \n\n          It  is  true  that  PSNH, as  a  technical  matter,\n\n\"emerged\" from  bankruptcy prior  to FERC's  consideration of\n\nthe proposed merger.  The ALJ and the Commission did not hold\n\notherwise.   The  ALJ  stated, and  the Commission  summarily\n\naffirmed the fact that \"[t]he merger is part of  a plan which\n                                                       \n\nenables a  reorganized PSNH to  emerge from bankruptcy.\"   53\n\nF.E.R.C. at 65,211  (emphasis added); see also 56 F.E.R.C. at\n                                              \n\n                             -18-\n\n61,993.  Like the state regulators  who approved the two-step\n\nmerger  plan, the Commission  evaluated the plan  as a whole,\n\nanticipating  \"the merger   not  `stand alone' PSNH    as the\n\nultimate destiny  for the reorganized company.\"   53 F.E.R.C.\n\nat 65,211.   \"All parties to  the reorganization contemplated\n\n[stand  alone]  status as  an interim  step  en route  to the\n\nmerger.\"  Id.   It was the entire  plan, which admittedly had\n             \n\ntwo  sequential and  severable  steps, that  allowed PSNH  to\n\nemerge  from bankruptcy.  There is no evidence that the state\n\nregulators would have approved a plan to allow PSNH to emerge\n\nfrom bankruptcy  that included  only the first  \"stand alone\"\n\nstep.  Indeed, there is evidence to the contrary.\n\n          FERC  also found that \"resolving\" PSNH's bankruptcy\n\nmeant  more  than  simply  the emergence  of  PSNH  from  the\n\nprotection of  bankruptcy court.   FERC held  that the  final\n\nresolution of PSNH's bankruptcy included the treatment of its\n\ncreditors and  stockholders who stood  to lose  approximately\n\n$250 million  in  the absence  of  the merger.    As the  ALJ\n\nobserved, the Commission \"regard[s] the right of these public\n\nbondholders as of primary importance after the consumers have\n\nbeen protected.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,211 (quoting In re Evans,\n                                                            \n\n1 F.P.C. 511, 517  (1937) (approving an acquisition involving\n\nthe reorganization  of a bankrupt utility)).   The Commission\n\nalso held that it was  in the public interest to  approve the\n\ncreation  of a  stronger, more  viable merged  entity, rather\n\n                             -19-\n\nthan leaving PSNH in a \"weakened\", \"stand alone\" state.  This\n\nholding was sufficiently supported by evidence in the record.\n\n          Petitioners also  claim that, given  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's   \"feasibility   finding\"  required   by   11  U.S.C.\n\n  1129(a)(11),36  the Commission  was estopped  from reaching\n\nthe  conclusion that a \"stand  alone\" PSNH would  be \"weak.\" \n\nWe disagree.   The  bankruptcy court  and FERC evaluated  the\n\nmerger proposal under  different standards.   The  bankruptcy\n\ncourt  was required  to determine  the likelihood  of further\n\nliquidation or reorganization proceedings were the plan to be\n\napproved.  FERC was obliged to determine whether the plan was\n\n\"consistent  with   the  public   interest.\"    It   was  not\n\ninconsistent for FERC to find that although PSNH was  capable\n\nof  surviving  as  a stand  alone  entity,  it  would not  be\n\n\"consistent  with the  public interest\"  to prevent  a merger\n\nthat  would  result   in  an  even  stronger  utility.    The\n\nprinciples of estoppel simply do not apply  in a case such as\n\nthis, where the issues litigated and the standards applied in\n\nthe two proceedings are so different. \n\n                    \n\n36   The Bankruptcy Code provides that:\n     (a)   The   court   shall  confirm   a   plan   [of\n     reorganization]  only  if   all  of  the  following\n     requirements are met:\n     (11) confirmation  of the plan is not  likely to be\n     followed  by  the  liquidation,  or  the  need  for\n     further financial reorganization, of the  debtor or\n     any successor to the  debtor under the plan, unless\n     such liquidation  or reorganization is  proposed in\n     the plan.\n  11 U.S.C.   1129(a)(11).\n\n                             -20-\n\n          Even were petitioners correct in their asseveration\n\nthat  FERC  improperly  counted  the  resolution   of  PSNH's\n\nbankruptcy  as a  benefit  of the  merger, \"the  Commission's\n\nerror would be immaterial in light of the overwhelming excess\n\nof other  benefits ($791  million) over  the costs  (0) still\n\nattributable . . . to the acquisition.\"   City of Holyoke Gas\n                                                             \n\n&amp; Elec. Dep't v. S.E.C., 972 F.2d 358, 362 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n                       \n\n          Second,  petitioners  argue that  FERC  erred  as a\n\nmatter  of law  in  weighing as  merger  benefits results  or\n\nalleged  savings   that  were,  or  could   be,  achieved  by\n\n\"alternate  means.\"   Specifically, petitioners  contend that\n\nFERC's   failure  to   apply  the   \"alternate   means\"  test\n\ncontradicted  general agency  policy  and  general  antitrust\n\nprinciples. \n\n          It is undisputed  that utilities  are \"not  immune\"\n\nfrom antitrust laws.

Boston  Edison, 915\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  17 (1st  Cir.  1990), cert.  denied,  111 S.  Ct.  1337\n                                         \n\n(1991).  At issue in this case is whether FERC is required by\n\nstatute,  or otherwise,  to  engage  in \"standard\"  antitrust\n\nanalysis before  passing on    203  merger applications.   In\n\nclaiming that  FERC has such an  obligation, petitioners rely\n\non a statute  governing agency approval of  bank mergers (the\n\n                             -21-\n\n\"Bank  Merger  Act\")  which   states  that  the  agency  with\n\njurisdiction over a proposed bank merger,37\n\n          shall not approve  \n             (A)  any  proposed merger  transaction\n          which  would result  in  a  monopoly,  or\n          which  would  be  in furtherance  of  any\n          combination  or conspiracy  to monopolize\n          or  to attempt to monopolize the business\n          of  banking in  any  part  of the  United\n          States, or\n             (B)   any    other   proposed   merger\n          transaction whose effect  in any  section\n          of  the country  may be  substantially to\n          lessen  competition, or to tend to create\n          a monopoly, or which in any  other manner\n          would be in restraint of trade, unless it\n          finds that the anticompetitive effects of\n          the  proposed   transaction  are  clearly\n          outweighed in the public interest  by the\n          probable  effects  of the  transaction in\n          meeting the convenience  and needs of the\n          community to be served. . . .\n          (6)   The    responsible   agency   shall\n          immediately  notify the  Attorney General\n          of any  approval by  it pursuant  to this\n          subsection    of   a    proposed   merger\n          transaction.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1828(c)(5)-(6).   The Supreme Court, interpreting\n\nthe Bank Merger Act, has held that before a bank merger which\n\nis  injurious to  the  public interest  may  be approved,  \"a\n\nshowing [must] be made that the gain expected from the merger\n\ncannot  reasonably be expected through other means.\"  U.S. v.\n                                                          \n\nPhillipsburg Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 399 U.S. 350, 372 (1970).\n                                  \n\nPetitioners claim that the language of the Bank Merger Act is\n\nsufficiently similar to the statute governing FERC's approval\n\n                    \n\n37   Jurisdiction varies  depending on whether  the resulting\nentity  is  a national  bank, a  state  member bank,  a state\nnonmember bank, or a savings association.\n\n                             -22-\n\nof  proposed  mergers,  16  U.S.C.    824b(a),  because  both\n\ncontain  a \"public interest\" standard, to require FERC to use\n\nthe \"alternate means\" test which  bank regulators must use in\n\nevaluating proposed bank mergers.  We disagree.\n\n          As with  any matter  of statutory construction,  we\n\nfirst examine the language  of the statute.  Under  16 U.S.C.\n\n  824b(a),  the  Commission  is required,  after  notice  and\n\nopportunity  for hearing,  to  approve a  proposed merger  of\n\nutility  facilities if  it finds  that the proposal  \"will be\n\nconsistent  with  the  public interest.\"    That  is all  the\n\nstatute  says.  There  is no explicit  reference to antitrust\n\npolicies or principles.   There is no  evidence that Congress\n\nsought  to  have  the  Commission  serve  as  an  enforcer of\n\nantitrust  policy  in  conjunction  with  the  Department  of\n\nJustice and  the Federal Trade  Commission.  The  Bank Merger\n\nAct  reveals a  quite different  intention.   There, Congress\n\nexplicitly  set out  standards for  approval of  bank mergers\n\nthat incorporate  principles  embodied  in  the  Sherman  and\n\nClayton  Acts.   12  U.S.C.   1828(c)(5).   By  requiring the\n\nreviewing  agency  to  notify  the Attorney  General  of  any\n\ndecision  to approve  a  proposed bank  merger,  12 U.S.C.   \n\n1828(c)(6),  Congress  expressed  its  desire  to  have  bank\n\nregulators  serve as pre-screening  bodies of  mergers which,\n\nbecause of their importance or character, in most  cases also\n\ndeserve the attention of the Department of Justice.\n\n                             -23-\n\n          The Bank  Merger Act  carries with it  the implicit\n\npresumption that  mergers are  to be disapproved  (the agency\n\n\"shall not approve\" a  bank merger \"unless it finds  that the\n\nanticompetitive  effects are clearly outweighed in the public\n\ninterest\"  by   the  benefits   of  the  merger,   12  U.S.C.\n\n  1828(c)(5)).   The  FPA,  on the  other hand,  requires the\n\nCommission to approve any merger that is \"consistent with the\n\npublic  interest.\"     16   U.S.C.     824b(a).     Antitrust\n\nconsiderations   are,   of   course,   relevant   in   FERC's\n\nconsideration of  the \"public interest\"  in merger proposals.\n\nThe  statute,  however,  does  not require  FERC  to  analyze\n\nproposed mergers under the same standards that the Department\n\nof Justice or bank regulators must apply.\n\n          Although  the  Commission  must  include  antitrust\n\nconsiderations in its public interest calculus under the FPA,\n\nit is not  bound to use antitrust principles when they may be\n\ninconsistent  with the  Commission's  regulatory goals.   See\n                                                             \n\nOtter  Tail,   410  U.S.   at   373  (\"[a]lthough   antitrust\n           \n\nconsiderations  may be  relevant [in  determining  the public\n\ninterest], they are not determinative\").

FERC's  Failure to Condition  Merger on NU's Waiver\n          of Single Participant Status.\n\n          Petitioners  argue  that  the  Commission  erred in\n\nfailing to  condition the merger on waiver  by NU and PSNH of\n\n\"single participant status\" (\"SPS\")  in the New England Power\n\nPool (\"NEPOOL\"), thereby preventing  the imposition of a $364\n\nmillion cost shift  from NU and PSNH to  the other members of\n\nNEPOOL.\n\n          1.   Background.\n                         \n\n          NEPOOL is  a power  pool comprised  of most  of the\n\nutilities in New England.  The association is governed by the\n\nNew England  Power  Pool Agreement  (\"the  Agreement\")  which\n\nestablishes a \"comprehensive interconnection and coordination\n\narrangement\" among  its members in order  \"to achieve greater\n\n                             -25-\n\nreliability and economies in the  production of electricity.\"\n\nGroton v.  FERC,  587  F.2d  1296,  1298  (D.C.  Cir.  1978).\n               \n\nSection  202(a)  of the  Federal  Power  Act encourages  such\n\nvoluntary  interconnection  and  coordination of  electricity\n\ngenerating facilities in order to achieve economies of scale.\n\n16  U.S.C.    824a; see  also 16  U.S.C.    824a-1 (regarding\n                             \n\npooling  agreements).  The Agreement  was approved as a filed\n\nrate  schedule  by  FERC's  predecessor,  the  Federal  Power\n\nCommission.   53 F.E.R.C. at  65,213.  Under  its terms, each\n\nmember  is  required  to   supply  the  pool  with  resources\n\n(\"Capacity Responsibility\") according to a formula based upon\n\nthe  relationship of the member's peak load to an estimate of\n\naggregate peak load of all members.\n\n          NU  experiences its  peak load  in the  summer, and\n\nPSNH experiences its peak load in the winter.  By aggregating\n\nthese two,  complementary, peak loads, NU-PSNH  can achieve a\n\nlower Capacity Responsibility than would  be the case if  the\n\ntwo   utilities  remained  separate.    Because  the  overall\n\ncapacity requirements of NEPOOL  will not change as  a result\n\nof the merger, the Capacity Responsibilities of other members\n\nmust rise to  make up  for the savings  accruing to  NU-PSNH.\n\nThe  ALJ  accepted  the  \"undisputed\" estimate  that  \"single\n\nparticipant status\" (SPS)  will result in a  shifting of some\n\n$360  million in costs from  NU-PSNH to other  members of the\n\npool.

First, petitioners  claim that\n\nthe Commission  did not  properly interpret the  provision of\n\nthe NEPOOL Agreement which  governs the election of SPS.   We\n\nagree with  the Commission's finding that  the Agreement both\n\nspecifically allows for the election  by NU-PSNH of SPS,  and\n\nencourages  such elections.    Section 3.1  of the  Agreement\n\nprovides in relevant part that:\n\n          All  Entities which  are controlled  by a\n          single person (such as a corporation or a\n          common law business  trust) which owns at\n          least seventy-five percent of  the voting\n          shares   of   each  of   them   shall  be\n                                               \n          collectively   treated    as   a   single\n          Participant   for    purposes   of   this\n          Agreement, if they elect  such treatment.\n          They are  encouraged to  do so.   Such an\n                                        \n          election shall  be  made by  signing  the\n          appropriate   form  at   the  end   of  a\n          counterpart of this Agreement.\n\n(Emphasis  supplied.)    Both  the  ALJ  and  the  Commission\n\ninterpreted section 3.1 to be  an explicit endorsement of the\n\nelection of  SPS by NU-PSNH.   The  ALJ stated that  \"[i]t is\n\nundisputed  that  NU  and   PSNH  qualify  for  such  [single\n\nparticipant]  status under  the Agreement.\"   53  F.E.R.C. at\n\n65,213.  The Commission  gave great weight to the  unrebutted\n\ntestimony  of  witness  Bigelow,   who  participated  in  the\n\nnegotiation of  the NEPOOL Agreement regarding  the intent of\n\nthe  original  signatories   to  the   Agreement  and   their\n\n                             -28-\n\nrecognition  of  such  potentially  large  cost-shifts  among\n\nNEPOOL members.  Bigelow stated:\n\n          [W]hen  we put  NEPOOL together  20 years\n          ago,  we  recognized  that  these  things\n          might happen.  This is not something that\n          snuck  up  on people. . . .   And  we did\n          discuss  at  length  what   would  happen\n          because . . . we were then coming up to a\n          potential   merger   of  Boston   Edison,\n          Eastern Utilities, New England Power.  It\n          was recognized that these kinds of things\n          could happen in the future and we spelled\n          out the ground rules and  recognized that\n          that would  happen when it happened.  And\n          the  people   who  didn't  like   it  got\n          something else for it.\n\n53  F.E.R.C.  at 65,214.   Both  the  ALJ and  the Commission\n\nrejected petitioners' claim on the basis of both the language\n\nof the Agreement, and Bigelow's unrebutted testimony that not\n\nonly  had the  signatories been  aware of such  a potentially\n\nlarge  savings  shift, but  that  those  utilities that  were\n\ndissatisfied  with this risk  received additional concessions\n\nas  compensation.    We  will not  disturb  the  Commission's\n\nfindings.\n\n          Second,  petitioners claim  that the  Agreement, as\n\ninterpreted in  NEPOOL Power Pool Agreement,  56 F.P.C. 1562,\n                                           \n\n1580 (1976), aff'd sub nom. Municipalities of Groton v. FERC,\n                                                            \n\n587 F.2d 1296 (D.C. Cir. 1978), prohibits utilities with peak\n\nloads  in different  seasons  from  electing  SPS.    As  the\n\nCommission  explained,  this  argument  mischaracterizes  the\n\nAgreement and  the decision  of the Federal  Power Commission\n\n(\"FPC\") in NEPOOL.\n                 \n\n                             -29-\n\n          The NEPOOL Agreement, as  initially filed\n          and    as   approved,    allowed   single\n          participant    status    for    utilities\n          controlled by a single \"person\" owning at\n          least 75 percent of the voting shares  of\n          each utility.  An exception was expressly\n          allowed  in the  filed agreement  for any\n          Vermont  utility  which  elected   to  be\n          grouped   with  Vermont   Electric  Power\n          Company.  This exception was approved for\n          essentially two reasons:  (1) the Vermont\n          utilities  had  long  acted  as  a single\n          contiguous  integrated  electric  entity;\n          and (2) since  they all experienced their\n          peak loads in winter,  single participant\n          status would not give them a lower NEPOOL\n          Capability Responsibility (and consequent\n          savings).    A   broader  exception   was\n          denied, however, for a group of municipal\n          utilities (represented by MMWEC) that was\n          not entitled to single participant status\n          and  that lacked the two cited attributes\n          of the  Vermont utilities.  The basis for\n          the denial was that allowing  such status\n          for \"any group of systems, such as MMWEC,\n          could   well   be   detrimental  to   the\n          functioning of NEPOOL.\"\n             The  NEPOOL  decision, thus,  does not\n          stand  for  the  proposition that  single\n          participant status is  available only  to\n          utilities  having their peak loads in the\n          same  season.    Instead,   another  way,\n          indeed   the   primary   way,  in   which\n          utilities  may qualify  is  if  they  are\n          controlled  by  a  single person  with  a\n          least 75-percent common ownership.   That\n          is the basis upon  which NU and PSNH will\n          presumably seek to  qualify if the merger\n          is  approved.   Such status  is expressly\n          allowed   under   the  NEPOOL   Agreement\n          regardless of when NU and PSNH experience\n          their peak loads.\n\n56 F.E.R.C. at 61,996-97.  The reasons  offered by the FPC in\n\nits  decision  to  grant  a  special  exception  for  Vermont\n\nutilities seeking SPS were  not intended to be, and  are not,\n\nconditions, in  addition to those  set out in  the Agreement,\n\n                             -30-\n\nwhich must be satisfied to elect SPS.  The FPC did not narrow\n\nthe scope of Section  3.1 to apply only to  utilities sharing\n\nthe  same peak  load  season; rather,  it  created a  special\n\nexception to the  75 percent rule  to accommodate the  unique\n\nsituation faced by Vermont utilities.\n\n          Third, petitioners  claim that FERC failed  to give\n\nproper consideration  to Section  4.2 of the  Agreement, \"the\n\ninterests of  other  pool members,  and  the purpose  of  the\n\nAgreement as  a whole.\"  Essentially,  petitioners argue that\n\nallowing  NU-PSNH  to  elect  SPS  would  violate  a  general\n\nprovision  of the  Agreement, which states  that participants\n\n\"shall  not . . . take  advantage of  the provisions  of this\n\nAgreement so  as to harm another Participant  or to prejudice\n\nthe  position  of any  Participant  in  the electric  utility\n\nbusiness.\"   We  reject  this argument  for the  same reasons\n\nexpressed   by  the  Commission   in  its   decision  denying\n\npetitioners' request for a rehearing:\n\n          [W]e  find more  relevance in  the NEPOOL\n          Agreement's   explicit   endorsement   of\n          single  participant  status  than in  the\n          agreement's  general  goal of  \"equitable\n          sharing\"   and  prohibition   on  members\n          \"taking  advantage\"  of the  agreement to\n          harm  or prejudice  other  members.   The\n          NEPOOL Agreement  specifically encourages\n          eligible    parties   to    seek   single\n          participant status;  the provisions cited\n          by  the  intervenors  are   general,  not\n          specific.      Construing   the   general\n          consistent  with  the  specific, we  find\n          single participant status for  the merged\n          company  consistent   with  an  equitable\n          sharing,  as  envisioned  by  the  NEPOOL\n\n                             -31-\n\n          Agreement, and not  violative of the  ban\n          on  taking  advantage of  the agreement's\n          provisions  to  harm  or prejudice  other\n          members.\n\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,189.   We agree with FERC's  interpretation\n\nof  the  Agreement.     The  NEPOOL  signatories   explicitly\n\nencouraged  qualified  members  to  seek  SPS,   indeed  they\n\ncontemplated that members that merged might choose to do just\n\nthat.   We agree  with the  Commission's construction  of the\n\nAgreement which avoids a direct conflict between Sections 3.1\n\nand 4.2, and instead gives both provisions reasonable effect.\n\n          Fourth, petitioners argue that failure to condition\n\nthe   merger  on   waiver  of   SPS  would   create  \"serious\n\ndisincentives\"   for  current   members  to   continue  their\n\nmembership  in NEPOOL,  and  that the  breakup  of NEPOOL  is\n\ncontrary to the public interest.  Petitioners imply that FERC\n\ndid not take seriously their complaints about SPS, but rather\n\nrested its decision  not to  require a waiver  solely on  the\n\nfact that the Agreement allowed the election of SPS.  This is\n\nsimply not so.\n\n          The  Commission reversed  the ALJ  on the  issue of\n\nwhether SPS savings  should be  counted as a  benefit of  the\n\nmerger.   The Commission  found that  because the  cost shift\n\namounted  to  a  zero-sum   transaction,  with  NU  and  PSNH\n\nbenefitting and the other members burdened dollar-for-dollar,\n\nthe shift could not  be counted as a  benefit of the  merger.\n\n                             -32-\n\n56  F.E.R.C. at 61,997.  Thus, the Commission did not dismiss\n\npetitioners' claims regarding SPS without thought.\n\n          Also,  the ALJ  found,  and the  Commission agreed,\n\nthat SPS was essential to the merger, and that the merger, as\n\nconditioned, was in the public interest.  FERC must approve a\n\nproposed merger if it is consistent with the public interest.\n\n16  U.S.C.    824b(a).    FERC  has  the  discretion  to  add\n\nconditions  to a proposed  merger to  ensure that  the merger\n\nwill, taken as a whole, be in the public interest.  16 U.S.C.\n\n   824b(b).    FERC  need  not, however,  explain  why  every\n\ncondition, or failure to  establish a condition is consistent\n\nwith the public interest when considered separately and apart\n\nfrom the entire transaction.  Petitioners seem to argue  that\n\nFERC was required by law to  state why it was consistent with\n\nthe  public interest  to  follow the  explicit  terms of  the\n\napproved fifteen  year-old  NEPOOL Agreement  rather than  to\n\ncondition  the  merger  on   waiver  of  a  membership  right\n\nestablished by the Agreement.   FERC had no such  obligation.\n\nIt need not have  explained why it failed to add a particular\n\ncondition  prior to approving  a merger.   The statute simply\n\nprovides that \"[t]he Commission may grant any application for\n\nan order under this section in whole or in part and upon such\n\nterms and conditions as it  finds necessary or appropriate to\n\nsecure the  maintenance of adequate  service and coordination\n\nin  the   public  interest  of  facilities   subject  to  the\n\n                             -33-\n\njurisdiction  of the Commission.\"   16 U.S.C.    824b(b).  In\n\nthis  case, the Commission  set forth a  reasonable basis for\n\napproving the  merger as consistent with  the public interest\n\nin light of the supplementary conditions the Commission found\n\nnecessary.   FERC  need not  have gone  further than  this to\n\nexplain  why it  failed  to place  further conditions  on the\n\nmerger.\n\n          Fifth,   petitioners   allege   that   FERC   acted\n\ninconsistently in  its  treatment of  the NEPOOL  Agreement's\n\nprovisions regarding  voting rights and SPS.   The Commission\n\nadopted  a  condition limiting  the  merged company's  NEPOOL\n\nvoting  rights to  prevent PSNH  and NU  from gaining  a veto\n\npower  in NEPOOL.  56  F.E.R.C. at 62,043-45.   FERC reasoned\n\nthat,  while   there  was   evidence  that   the  signatories\n\nanticipated  that  large   cost-shifts  would  accompany  the\n\nelection  of SPS in merger  situations, there was no evidence\n\nthat they anticipated the  voting rights implications of such\n\nmergers.   58 F.E.R.C.  at 61,189.   It was not,  contrary to\n\npetitioners' argument,  inconsistent as a matter  of logic to\n\ncondition voting rights where the Agreement was silent on the\n\nneed or lack of need to do so, while failing to condition SPS\n\nwhere the  Agreement explicitly favored the  election of SPS.\n\nFurthermore, it was not  an error of law to  condition voting\n\nrights while  leaving SPS  rights untouched.   Petitioners do\n\nnot  contest the Commission's decision to condition NU-PSNH's\n\n                             -34-\n\nvoting  rights.    We  will uphold  whatever  conditions  the\n\nCommission  imposes on  a proposed  merger  so long  as their\n\nnecessity is supported in the record by substantial evidence.\n\n          Finally,  petitioners  contend that  the Commission\n\n\"failed to  explain why  burdening other NEPOOL  members with\n\n$364 million in additional  costs with no offsetting benefits\n\nto them is consistent  with the public interest.\"   In making\n\nthis argument, petitioners imply that each and every piece of\n\na complex package of merger agreements and conditions must be\n\nable to  withstand \"public interest\"  analysis without regard\n\nto other pieces of the package or to other conditions imposed\n\nby  the  Commission.   Petitioners  also  imply that  if  any\n\nindividual or group is harmed by a piece of the package, that\n\nprovision is not in the public interest and must therefore be\n\nstricken  or modified.   Both  implicit arguments  are deeply\n\nflawed.\n\n          In  evaluating a  transaction  such as  the one  at\n\nissue  here, the  Commission  is required  to  find that  the\n\nentire transaction, taken as a whole,  is consistent with the\n\npublic interest.  16 U.S.C.    824b(a).  Each element of  the\n\ntransaction  need not  benefit  every  utility or  individual\n\nwhich might  be affected; rather, the  whole transaction must\n\nbe consistent with the interest of \"the public.\"  There is no\n\nreason  to  think  that  the interest  of  individual  NEPOOL\n\nmembers is  synonymous with  the \"public\"  interest.  As  has\n\n                             -35-\n\nalready been noted,  FERC may  add conditions  to a  proposed\n\nmerger before granting approval.   16 U.S.C.   824b(b).   The\n\nstatute  does  not  require,  however,  that  FERC  establish\n\nconditions so  that every effect of an  approved merger could\n\nwithstand the \"public interest\" test.\n\n          At  a less  theoretical level,  the ALJ  determined\n\nthat the NEPOOL savings  \"were a vital  part of the long  and\n\nstrenuous negotiations which culminated in the resulting PSNH\n\nreorganization plan,\"  and  the particular  savings  of  $146\n\nmillion   for  New   Hampshire   consumers  were   relied  on\n\nspecifically by the  State of New Hampshire in  approving the\n\nmerged company's rate package.   53 F.E.R.C. at 65,213.   The\n\nCommission accepted this  finding of the  ALJ, while, at  the\n\nsame time, it reversed  the ALJ's decision to count  the $360\n\nmillion as  a benefit of the merger.   58 F.E.R.C. at 61,997.\n\nThe fact that  the cost-shift was not a benefit to be counted\n\nin weighing the  benefits and  costs of the  merger does  not\n\nmean that  the election of SPS and the concomitant cost-shift\n\nis not in  the public interest.   Election of  SPS is in  the\n\npublic interest because it is a central element of the merger\n\nplan  which, viewed  as  a whole,  was  found by  FERC  to be\n\nconsistent  with  the public  interest  based  on substantial\n\nevidence in the record.  We approve the Commission's decision\n\nnot to condition the merger on waiver by NU of SPS.\n\n     C.   Timing of Merger's Consummation.\n\n                             -36-\n\n          In  the  proceedings before  the  ALJ,  NU proposed\n\nfiling  a transmission  tariff within  60 days  following the\n\nmerger.  Intervenors and Commission staff proposed the filing\n\nand  approval of  an  interim  transmission  rate.   The  ALJ\n\nrejected  both proposals  and  instead held  that the  merger\n\nwould  be  consummated upon  the  filing  of NU's  compliance\n                                        \n\ntariff.  He reasoned as follows:\n\n          I see no  need for  requiring one  tariff\n          (with potential for controversy, charges,\n          collections and refunds)  to be  followed\n          by  yet  another  tariff,  with  its  own\n          potential for still other disputes.\n             Avoiding  a  transitional period  will\n          make   it   unnecessary   to  require   a\n          transitional  tariff.    To achieve  this\n          result, consummation of  the merger  must\n          be conditioned on  the concurrent  filing\n          of  a  compliance   tariff  which   fully\n          reflects all of  the terms and conditions\n          set out in this Initial Decision.  Such a\n          condition should encourage  a prompt  and\n          fair compliance filing  because NU  could\n          not begin  to  reap the  merger  benefits\n          without it.\n\n53 F.E.R.C. at 65,221.  The Commission concurred:\n\n             We    believe    the   GTC    [General\n          Transmission   Conditions]  and   the  NH\n          Corridor  Proposal,  as modified  herein,\n          adequately    mitigate    the    merger's\n          anticompetitive effects without requiring\n          the adoption of the Merger Tariff.  Trial\n          Staff stated that the Merger Tariff would\n          make  service available  immediately upon\n          approval of the merger.   We believe that\n          the presiding judge accomplished the same\n          result  by  allowing consummation  of the\n          merger  when  NU  submits its  compliance\n          filing.\n             We further believe  that delaying  the\n          merger's    consummation    until     the\n          Commission   accepts    NU's   compliance\n\n                             -37-\n\n          submittal    for    filing    would    be\n          inappropriate   given   the   uncertainty\n          surrounding    issues   which    may   be\n          challenged   and   subject   to   further\n          litigation  in the  compliance proceeding\n          and  given our  commitment to  act before\n          the Merger Agreement's December  31, 1991\n          termination date.  We believe that NU and\n          PSNH are  entitled to  a prompt and  fair\n          resolution  of this  proceeding.   At the\n          same time the intervenors are entitled to\n          have service begin as soon  as practical,\n          together  with a  fair resolution  of any\n          disputes raised regarding NU's compliance\n          filing.  Accordingly, we believe  that it\n          is in the best  interests of all  parties\n          to allow NU to consummate the merger when\n          it submits  its  compliance filing.    We\n          shall also require  NU to begin  honoring\n          such  requests  for transmission  service\n          under the  GTC,  as modified  herein,  at\n          that  time.    Such transmission  service\n          will be  provided at  either the firm  or\n          non-firm  transmission rates  proposed in\n          NU's   compliance   filing,  subject   to\n          refund, and  without a refund  floor.  In\n          reviewing    NU's   filing    to   ensure\n          compliance  with  this  Opinion, we  will\n          hold  NU to a very high  standard.  As NU\n          itself  states, \"[i]f NU  fails to comply\n          with  the  letter   or  spirit  of   such\n          [Commission]  requirement,  NU  would  be\n          subject to summary judgment  with respect\n          to any aspect of its compliance filing.\"\n\n56 F.E.R.C. at 62,025.\n\n          Petitioners'  stated concern  is that,  by allowing\n\nthe  merger to be consummated prior to FERC's approval of the\n\ncompliance tariff, FERC did not provide a sufficient guaranty\n\nthat NU would provide transmission access that would mitigate\n\n                             -38-\n\nthe  merger's  anticompetitive  effects.38    Petitioners  do\n\nnot, however,  seek  to unravel  the  merger.

Petitioners complain that\n\nthe course chosen by FERC creates an incentive on the part of\n\nNU  to delay  proceedings on  the compliance  tariff, thereby\n\nmaximizing  competitive  advantage.   Petitioners do  not, of\n\ncourse,  point  out  that  their  proposal  would  create  an\n\nincentive  on  their  part to  delay  final  approval of  the\n\ncompliance tariff, thereby postponing the day when the NEPOOL\n\ncost shift will take effect.\n\n          The ALJ and the Commission carefully considered the\n\nalternatives before reaching their decisions.  The Commission\n\nheld that the anticompetitive effects of the merger  would be\n\nadequately  mitigated  by  the  dual  requirements   that  NU\n\nimmediately provide  transmission access upon  the filing  of\n\nits compliance  tariff, and  that any  fees  collected by  NU\n\nwould be subject to  refund without a refund floor.   Because\n\nNU  accepted  these  merger conditions,  the  Commission  can\n\nenforce NU's  promise to pay  such refunds if  the Commission\n\nfinds them to be appropriate.

FERC  did not  defer, as  petitioners\n\nsuggest,  consideration of the anticompetitive effects of the\n\nmerger  which  FERC  itself   identified.

Protection of Native Load Customers.\n\n          1.   Priority of Services.\n                                   \n\n                             -40-\n\n               a.   Background.\n                              \n\n          In its  merger  application, NU  made  a  voluntary\n\ncommitment   to   provide  wholesale   transmission  service,\n\nincluding third  party wheeling  service,39  for any  utility\n\nover  its existing transmission system.  At the same time, NU\n\nsought  to limit  this  obligation by  reserving an  absolute\n\npriority  for  power  purchases  on  behalf  of  native  load\n\ncustomers (whose  power  needs NU  is bound  by franchise  or\n\ncontract  to  meet).   The  ALJ  held  that  although NU  may\n\nreasonably give  native load service  priority over  wheeling\n\nservice if NU's transmission system had insufficient capacity\n\nto serve both, 53  F.E.R.C. at 65,221-222, NU could  not deny\n\nfirm  wheeling   requests  based  upon  the   reservation  of\n\ntransmission  capacity for  its  own non-firm  sales, id.  at\n                                                         \n\n65,225.  \n\n          In Opinion  No.  364, the  Commission balanced  the\n\ninterests of  native load customers and  third party wheeling\n\ncustomers  and  affirmed  the  ALJ's denial  of  an  absolute\n\npriority:\n\n          we  .  . .  deny  NU's  proposal to  give\n          higher priority to  its own non-firm  use\n          than  to third  party  requests for  firm\n          wheeling    in     allocating    existing\n          transmission  capacity.    In  no  event,\n          however, will  NU be required  to provide\n          firm third party wheeling service  out of\n          existing   transmission   facilities   if\n\n                    \n\n39   For a definition of \"wheeling\" see n.9, supra.\n                                                  \n\n                             -41-\n\n          reliability  of  service  to native  load\n          customers would be adversely affected.\n\n56  F.E.R.C. at  62,021 (footnote  omitted).   The Commission\n\nfound it \"reasonable to allow NU to reserve firm transmission\n\ncapacity  to  provide reliable  service  to  its native  load\n                              \n\ncustomers.\"  Id. (Emphasis in original.)\n                \n\n          On rehearing,  NU asked the  Commission to  clarify\n\nthe  scope of  the \"reliability\"  criterion.   The Commission\n\n\"reiterate[d] that under no circumstances will NU be required\n\nto provide firm wheeling service out of existing transmission\n\ncapacity where  doing so would impair  or degrade reliability\n\nof  service to native load customers.\"  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,199\n\n(emphasis  removed).   The  Commission  held  the concept  of\n\nreliability generally  encompasses the:   (1) reservation  of\n\ntransmission capacity to back  up large generating units; (2)\n\nprovision of generation reserves; and (3) coverage of certain\n\nfuture  needs.     As  to  the  coverage   of  future  demand\n\nrequirements, the Commission  specifically ordered that  \"any\n\ncapacity needed for reliability purposes  within a reasonable\n\nplanning horizon  must be offered  for wheeling use  until NU\n\nexpects  to need the capacity  for reliability reasons.\"  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 61,199-200.\n\n          Petitioners assert  that the  decision to accord  a\n\npriority to native load  over transmission load is arbitrary,\n\ndiscriminatory, and  anticompetitive.   They argue  that FERC\n\nneither  defined  nor  justified  the   priority  granted  by\n\n                             -42-\n\nallowing reservation of transmission capacity for native load\n\nservice  and  that  any  such  priority  creates  competitive\n\nadvantages for  NU.  We  hold that the  Commission adequately\n\ndefined and reasonably justified its decision to allow such a\n\nreservation  and  properly   addressed  the   anticompetitive\n\nconcerns raised by the intervenors.  \n\n               b.   Discussion.\n                              \n\n          Although the Commission reaffirmed the general rule\n\nthat  firm transmission service  should be  accorded priority\n\nover  non-firm  service, even  if  the  latter would  benefit\n\nnative load,    it nonetheless  allowed  NU to  reserve  firm\n\ntransmission capacity  needed to ensure reliability of native\n\nload  service and allowed the  use of this  capacity for non-\n\nfirm transactions.  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,196.  Thus, native load\n\nservice will receive  a \"priority\" over third-party  wheeling\n\nservice  in  allocating existing  transmission  capacity when\n\nreliability  of service  to  native load  would be  adversely\n\naffected.     The  Commission  specifically   qualified  this\n\npriority by requiring NU  to offer the capacity  for wheeling\n\nuse until NU needed  it to assure reliability to  native load\n\ncustomers.\n\n          There  is nothing arbitrary or discriminatory about\n\nFERC's decision.  It struck  a reasonable balance between the\n\ncompeting interests of native load customers and  third-party\n\nwheeling customers.  NU-PSNH is obligated to serve its native\n\n                             -43-\n\nload  customers.  In return for this obligation to serve, the\n\nnative load customers regularly bear the cost of transmission\n\nfacilities;  native load  customers pay  for them,  use them,\n\nplan  on them, and rely on them.   As the ALJ noted, \"[e]very\n\nNew England utility favors  its own native load.   Nothing in\n\nthe NEPOOL agreement requires  its members to surrender their\n\nnative load preference, and none do.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,222.\n\nThus,  \"NU should be allowed  to give priority  over safe and\n\nreliable service to its  native load customers using existing\n\ntransmission capacity  built to  serve those customers.\"   58\n\nF.E.R.C. at  61,199.   FERC explicitly defined  and justified\n\nthe challenged native load \"priority.\"\n\n          2.   Transmission Upgrades Pricing.\n                                             \n\n               a.   Background.\n                              \n\n          NU's commitment to provide third-party transmission\n\nservice   includes   the  obligation   to   build  additional\n\ntransmission facilities as necessary to  relieve transmission\n\nconstraints on  its system.   58  F.E.R.C.  at 61,204-10;  56\n\nF.E.R.C. at 62,021-24.   The issue  then becomes, how  should\n\nthe  cost  of  constructing  such  transmission  upgrades  be\n\nallocated.  The ALJ stated  that questions of cost allocation\n\nare  best  addressed  in  future  proceedings  regarding  the\n\nparticular   responsibilities   for  particular   facilities.\n\nNevertheless,  the ALJ  adopted  the \"but  for\" analysis  for\n\ndetermining responsibility proposed by NU witness Schultheis:\n\n                             -44-\n\n          [W]heeling customers must make a pro rata\n          contribution   whenever  the   facilities\n          would  not have been  needed but  for the\n          wheeling  transfers across  a constrained\n          interface.   This means that  NU's native\n          load customers pay for the new facilities\n          they  create  the need  for  and wheeling\n          customers  pay  for  the facilities  they\n          create the need for.\n\n53 F.E.R.C. at 65,223.  The ALJ also noted that the financial\n\nexposure of  transmission customers  was limited by  the cost\n\ncaps  to  which NU  was committed.40    Id. at  65,224.   The\n                                           \n\nCommission agreed that cost  questions should be litigated in\n\nthe context of a specific proposal,  and accepted the concept\n\nof  the \"but for\" test  as a framework  for ascertaining cost\n\nresponsibility and the  use of  the proposed cost  caps as  a\n\nreasonable  means of  limiting  the  transmission  customers'\n\nresponsibility for  future upgrades.  56  F.E.R.C. at 62,028-\n\n030.   The Commission reaffirmed that  decision on rehearing.\n\n58 F.E.R.C. 61,204-207.\n\n          Petitioners  contend that the  Commission failed to\n\nadequately  explain  the pricing  policy  it  will employ  in\n\npricing  transmission upgrades.  Basically, petitioners claim\n\nthe ruling is too ambiguous to determine whether, or how, the\n\n                    \n\n40  NU committed  to cap  cost responsibility  to \"(1)  those\nspecific facilities  identified  by NU  at  the time  of  the\nwheeling request as needing to be built or upgraded either at\nthe time of the request or in the future; and (2) the maximum\ndollar  amount  contained  in  NU's  initial  estimate  of  a\nwheeling customer's pro  rata share  of the  costs of  future\nupgrades  needed  to  accommodate   a  request  for  wheeling\nservice.\"  \n56 F.E.R.C. at 62,031-32.\n\n                             -45-\n\nCommission changed its  policy from the traditional  \"rolled-\n\nin\" approach used  in pricing transmission service.   We hold\n\nthat   the  Commission   provided   a  clear   and   reasoned\n\njustification for  the principles that will  guide its future\n\ndeterminations of  transmission upgrade  pricing.  We  affirm\n\nthe Commission's decision not  to modify the basic principles\n\nadopted in its order.\n\n               b.   Discussion.\n                              \n\n          In accepting as reasonable  the \"but for\" test, the\n\nCommission  has  done no  more than  approve a  framework for\n\ndetermining  cost responsibility  which furthers  the general\n\nprinciple  that transmission  costs should  be born  by those\n\nentities  responsible  for the  cost.    58 F.E.R.C.  61,205.\n\nUnder  this test,  incremental  cost pricing  could be  found\n\nappropriate when firm wheeling across  a particular interface\n\nwould  degrade reliability absent  upgrades.   The Commission\n\nspecifically declined, however, to answer the requests of the\n\nintervenors  to  decide  the \"rolled-in  versus  incremental\"\n\nrate41 issue in  the abstract and  chose instead to  evaluate\n\nit only within the  context of a particular rate  proposal or\n\nupgrade.  Id.   The Commission articulated  how it envisioned\n             \n\n                    \n\n41  Under \"rolled  in\" pricing principles, the upgrade  costs\nwould  be rolled in with  other company costs  and charged to\nall ratepayers as part of NU's  general rate structure; while\nadministratively   simple,   it   ignores  any   concept   of\nresponsibility.  Thus, incremental pricing principles look to\nhold parties responsible for their share of upgrade costs.\n\n                             -46-\n\npricing  transmission  upgrades   and  adopted  a   condition\n\nlimiting  the  amount  NU  may  propose  to  collect  from  a\n\ntransmission customer to the greater of \n\n          (1) the incremental  cost of new  network\n          facilities  required  at  the   time  the\n          customer's new transmission load is added\n          or (2) the rolled-in cost of  all network\n          facilities required to serve the combined\n          transmission loads of [NU], including any\n          required transmission additions.\n\nId. at 61,206.   Thus, a wheeling customer may be charged the\n   \n\ngreater of rolled-in cost rates or incremental cost rates.   \n\n          The Commission acknowledged  that the  introduction\n\nof incremental  cost pricing  principles is a  departure from\n\nits  traditional pricing  policies42 and  justified  this new\n\npolicy  on NU's  unprecedented  obligation  to provide  third\n\nparty transmission service.   Id.  The  Commission noted that\n                                 \n\nincremental  cost  pricing  may  be  appropriate  in  certain\n\ncircumstances,  but  decided to  leave  the  details of  cost\n\nresponsibility  questions to  a  future specific  section 205\n\nrate case.  When such a  case arises, NU will bear the burden\n\nof   justifying  \"any   direct  assignments   of   costs  and\n\nsupport[ing] any arguments that  reliability is degraded by a\n\nparticular  firm transmission  service.    No presumption  is\n\n                    \n\n42     The  Commission generally  has  adhered to  rolled  in\npricing,   but  has   never  precluded   particularized  cost\nallocations to  specific  customers where  appropriate.   See\n                                                             \nUtah Power &amp; Light Co., 45 F.E.R.C.   61,095, at 61,291 n.163\n                      \n(1988);  Public Service Co. of Indiana, 51 F.E.R.C.   61,367,\n                                      \nat 62,203 (1990).\n\n                             -47-\n\ncreated  by  NU's  `but  for' criterion  that  firm  wheeling\n\ncustomers always cause the need for upgrades.\"  Id. at 61,207\n                                                   \n\n(quoting 56 F.E.R.C. at 62031).   The Commission also allowed\n\nthat  any  reliance by  NU  upon the  \"but  for\" test  may be\n\nchallenged in  future actions.   The Commission  sufficiently\n\nexplained and  justified the  principles that will  guide its\n\ntransmission upgrade pricing.\n\n     E.   Opportunity Cost Pricing.\n\n          As has already been discussed, the Commission found\n\nit necessary to impose a number of conditions on the proposed\n\nNU-PSNH merger to mitigate  the merged company's market power\n\nin the  markets for  transmission and short-term  bulk power.\n\n58 F.E.R.C.  at 61,195.    Specifically, the  Commission held\n\nthat  NU  must  provide  firm  transmission  service  out  of\n\nexisting  capacity  for  any   utility,  subject  only  to  a\n\nreservation  of  sufficient  capacity  to  maintain  reliable\n\nservice to its  native load customers  and to honor  existing\n\ncontractual obligations.   NU was  prohibited, however,  from\n\ndenying a request for  firm transmission service by reserving\n\ncapacity for  non-firm transactions  that would enable  it to\n\nprovide more economical service to its native load customers.\n\n56 F.E.R.C.  at 62,014-21;  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,196-200.   FERC\n\nalso  held   that  NU  must  build   additional  transmission\n\nfacilities   as   needed   to   provide   transmission  where\n\ninsufficient capacity  exists.  56 F.E.R.C.  at 62,021-24; 58\n\n                             -48-\n\nF.E.R.C. at 61,204-10.   The Commission found that  these and\n\nother conditions  would  \"adequately mitigate\"  the  merger's\n\nanticompetitive effects.  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,213.\n\n          On rehearing, NU and  the States of Connecticut and\n\nNew Hampshire  argued that the Commission  should address the\n\nissue of  firm transmission  pricing because, in  Opinion No.\n\n364, FERC  had established  principles governing  the related\n\nissue of  firm transmission priority which  made NU's ability\n\nto purchase  inexpensive power (which would lower its cost of\n\nserving  its  native  load  customers)  subordinate  to   its\n\nobligation  to provide  firm transmission for  third parties.\n\n58  F.E.R.C.  at  61,201-02.    The  Commission  agreed,  but\n\ndeclined  to approve  \"opportunity  cost  pricing\"43  outside\n\nthe  context of  a specific  tariff proposal.   Instead,  the\n\nCommission announced three \"basic  goals\" to guide its future\n\ndecisions on the  pricing of firm transmission service on the\n\nmerged company's existing capacity, and left the door open to\n\nNU  to propose  a tariff  based on  opportunity costs  or any\n\n                    \n\n43   As the Commission explained, opportunity costs\n          are the  revenues lost or  costs incurred\n          by  a  utility  in providing  third-party\n          transmission  service  when  transmission\n          capacity is insufficient to  satisfy both\n          a  third-party  wheeling request  and the\n          utility's   own   use.     For   example,\n          opportunity   costs  might   include  the\n          revenues lost or costs incurred because a\n          utility  must  reduce its  own off-system\n          purchases or sales in order to overcome a\n          constraint on the [transmission] grid.\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,200-201.\n\n                             -49-\n\nother  methodology  that would  meet  the three  goals.   The\n\nCommission explained its decision as follows:\n\n            We are now confronted with the need  to\n          provide   NU   with  enough   specificity\n          regarding  what it  will  be  allowed  to\n          propose for the  pricing of future third-\n          party  wheeling  service,  so   that  the\n          company  can  decide  whether to  proceed\n          with the  merger.  We also  cannot ignore\n          the  need  to  act  as  expeditiously  as\n          possible  given the  commercial realities\n          and time pressures presented in corporate\n          matters subject to our  jurisdiction, and\n          in  particular  the  need  to  resolve  a\n          bankruptcy situation.   At the  same time\n          we are confronted with the need to ensure\n          an  adequate record on pricing issues and\n          to   afford   all  parties   an  adequate\n          opportunity to voice their objections.\n            Balancing  these  respective needs,  we\n          conclude  that  the  best  course  is  to\n          provide guidance on  pricing issues,  but\n          to defer specific  pricing issues to  the\n          compliance phase of  this proceeding,  or\n          to subsequent cases where  the Commission\n          may consider specific  proposals from  NU\n          in a concrete, factual setting and with a\n          more developed record.\n          . . . .\n          First, the  native load customers  of the\n                                                   \n          utility  providing  transmission  service\n                                                   \n          should   be   held  harmless.     Second,\n                                                   \n          transmission customers  should be charged\n                                                   \n          the lowest reasonable cost-based rate for\n                                                   \n          third-party transmission service.  Third,\n                                                   \n          the pricing should prevent the collection\n                                                   \n          of  monopoly  rents  by the  transmission\n                                                   \n          owner and  promote efficient transmission\n                                                   \n          decisions.      In  ruling   on  specific\n                   \n          proposed  rates,  we  will balance  these\n          three  goals  in light  of the  facts and\n          circumstances presented at that time.   \n\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,203 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).\n\n          FERC  was careful  to  point out  that it  endorsed\n\nopportunity cost pricing  only insofar as NU  could show that\n\n                             -50-\n\nit could \"propose rates which  include legitimate, verifiable\n\nopportunity costs.\"  Id.   The Commission warned NU  that any\n                        \n\nsuch  proposal would  be carefully  scrutinized and  would be\n\nsubject to challenge.  Id. at 61,203-04.  Specifically,  FERC\n                          \n\nstated that  NU would  have to  address the  following issues\n\nshould it seek recovery of opportunity costs:\n\n          (1) whether opportunity  costs should  be\n          capped by incremental expansion  costs or\n          any  other  cap;   (2)  whether   current\n          wheeling   and   wholesale   requirements\n          customers  should be  treated differently\n          from   future   wheeling  and   wholesale\n          requirements    customers,    e.g.,    by\n                                            \n          receiving    \"grandfather\"   rights    to\n          embedded cost  rates  for the  amount  of\n          transmission  capacity they  already use;\n          (3) how NU  will identify those customers\n          responsible for growth on its  system and\n          what   particular   new  facilities   are\n          necessary to accommodate that growth; (4)\n          whether  and how third  parties should be\n          protected   from   uncertainty  regarding\n          fluctuations  in  opportunity costs;  (5)\n          how  the proposed rates  will prevent the\n          collection of monopoly rents; and (6) how\n          the  proposed  opportunity costs  will be\n          verified.\n\nId.    The Commission  expressly  postponed consideration  of\n   \n\nwhether opportunity cost pricing  would be inconsistent  with\n\nnondiscriminatory  pricing  and  nondiscriminatory terms  and\n\nconditions of  service until  those issues  were raised  in a\n\nconcrete factual context.  Id. at 61,204, n.118.\n                              \n\n          Petitioners claim that FERC's decision  amounted to\n\nan arbitrary endorsement of opportunity cost pricing that was\n\nnot  supported  by evidence  in  the  record, was  inherently\n\n                             -51-\n\ndiscriminatory, and contrary to FERC's  regulation of natural\n\ngas pipelines.   Petitioners' underlying concern  seems to be\n\nthat  when  the  issue arises  next  in  the  context of  the\n\nCommission's  review  of NU's  compliance  tariff, FERC  will\n\nsimply approve the tariff and dismiss petitioners' objections\n\non the  ground that  opportunity cost pricing  principles had\n\nalready  been  endorsed  by  the  Commission.    Although  we\n\nunderstand petitioners' concerns,  we believe  that they  are\n\nmisplaced and that FERC did not go as far as petitioners fear\n\nin endorsing opportunity cost pricing.\n\n          Petitioners will have an opportunity to contest any\n\ncompliance tariff proposed by NU.  The Commission itself laid\n\nout a number of issues which NU would have to address were it\n\nto  propose a tariff based on opportunity costs.  58 F.E.R.C.\n\nat 61,203.   Only  after carefully considering  the competing\n\ninterests of providing  guidance to  NU as to  what kinds  of\n\ntariffs it would consider, and  the need to endorse  specific\n\nmethodologies only on the  basis of a fully-developed record,\n\ndid  the Commission  decide  to outline  broad pricing  goals\n\nwhich would allow  for a number of pricing  schemes including\n\nopportunity  cost pricing.  Id.   It was  squarely within the\n                               \n\nCommission's  power  to defer  consideration  of petitioners'\n\nassertions until  after NU filed  its compliance tariff.   As\n\nthe  Supreme  Court  has  held,  \"[a]n  agency  enjoys  broad\n\ndiscretion in determining how  to handle related yet discrete\n\n                             -52-\n\nissues  in  terms  of  procedures, and  priorities.\"    Mobil\n                                                             \n\nExploration   &amp;   Producing   Southeast,   Inc.   v.

Petitioners argue that deferral was inappropriate\n\nin this case because  their objections went \"to the  heart of\n\nthe  public interest  determination  to be  made.\"   Maryland\n                                                             \n\nPeople's Counsel v. FERC, 761 F.2d 768, 778 (D.C. Cir. 1985).\n                        \n\nWe disagree.\n\n          The   Commission   announced   pricing  goals   and\n\nconditions  that   it  determined  would   keep  the   merger\n\nconsistent  with the  public  interest, and  would result  in\n\n\"just and  reasonable rates.\"   Until NU proposed  a specific\n\ntariff regime, the Commission did not have a developed record\n\nto evaluate on the  merits.  The Commission remains  free to,\n\nand  we expect it will, invite  objections to NU's compliance\n\ntariff from  affected parties,  and will reject  any proposed\n\ntariff that  conflicts with its  statutory responsibility  to\n\napprove rates  that are \"just and reasonable,\" and to approve\n\nmergers that are, as conditioned, \"consistent with the public\n\ninterest.\"\n\n     F.   Environmental Impact Statement.\n\n          The  City of  Holyoke  Gas  &amp;  Electric  Department\n\n(\"HG&amp;E\") alleges that FERC's refusal to examine the potential\n\nenvironmental  impacts  of its  approval  of  the merger  was\n\narbitrary and capricious.  We disagree.\n\n                             -53-\n\n          The National Environmental  Policy Act of 1969,  42\n\nU.S.C.    4321 et seq., (\"NEPA\") requires federal agencies to\n                      \n\nconsider the  potential environmental effects  of a  proposed\n\nmajor  federal  action  that  may  significantly  affect  the\n\nquality of the human environment.   Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA\n\nstates:\n\n          The Congress authorizes and directs that,\n          to the  fullest extent  possible:  . .  .\n          (2) all    agencies   of    the   Federal\n          Government shall  \n          . . . .\n          (C)  include  in every  recommendation or\n          report on proposals  for legislation  and\n          other major Federal actions significantly\n          affecting  the  quality   of  the   human\n          environment, a detailed statement  by the\n          responsible official on  \n            (i)  the  environmental  impact of  the\n          proposed action,\n            (ii) any  adverse environmental effects\n          which  cannot  be   avoided  should   the\n          proposal be implemented,\n            (iii)  alternatives   to  the  proposed\n          action,\n            (iv)  the  relationship  between  local\n          short-term uses of man's  environment and\n          the maintenance and enhancement  of long-\n          term productivity, and \n            (v) any  irreversible and irretrievable\n          commitments of resources  which would  be\n          involved in the proposed action should it\n          be implemented.\n\n42  U.S.C.    4332(2)(C).   Agencies  were authorized,  under\n\nguidelines  promulgated  by  the  Council   on  Environmental\n\nQuality (\"CEQ\"), to create categorical exclusions for actions\n\nwhich do not individually  or cumulatively have a significant\n\neffect  on  the human  environment.    40  C.F.R.     1507.3,\n\n1508.4.    FERC  adopted   such  a  category  of  exclusions,\n\n                             -54-\n\nincluding one for merger  approvals such as the one  at issue\n\nin this case.  That regulation states in pertinent part:\n\n          (a) General  rule.  Except  as stated  in\n          paragraph (b) of this section, neither an\n          environmental    assessment    nor     an\n          environmental  impact  statement will  be\n          prepared  for  the following  projects or\n          actions:\n          . . . .\n            (16) Approval of actions under sections\n          4(b), 203, 204, 301,  304, and 305 of the\n          Federal  Power  Act relating  to issuance\n          and  purchase of  securities, acquisition\n          or   disposition  of   property,  merger,\n          interlocking directorates, jurisdictional\n          determinations and accounting orders.\n\n18  C.F.R.    380.4(a)(16).    An  agency  need  not issue  a\n\n\"finding  of  no  significant  impact\"  in  cases  concerning\n\nmatters that fall into a categorical exclusion.  40 C.F.R.   \n\n1501.3, 1501.4, 1508.13.\n\n          CEQ  guidelines  also  required  agencies  adopting\n\ncategorical   exclusions   to   \"provide  for   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances in which a normally  excluded action may have a\n\nsignificant environmental effect.\"  40 C.F.R.   1508.4.  FERC\n\nmade such provision in its regulations:\n\n            (b)    Exceptions     to    categorical\n          exclusions. (1) In accordance with 40 CFR\n          1508.4, the Commission and its staff will\n          independently    evaluate   environmental\n          information  supplied  in an  application\n          and  in  comments by  the public.   Where\n          circumstances indicate that an action may\n          be a major  Federal action  significantly\n          affecting  the  quality   of  the   human\n          environment, the Commission:\n            (i) May require an environmental report\n          or    other    additional   environmental\n          information, and \n\n                             -55-\n\n            (ii)  Will   prepare  an  environmental\n          assessment  or  an  environmental  impact\n          statement.\n            (2) Such circumstances  may exist  when\n          the action  may have an effect  on one of\n          the following:\n            (i) Indian lands;\n            (ii) Wilderness areas;\n            (iii) Wild and scenic rivers;\n            (iv) Wetlands;\n            (v) Units of  the National Park System,\n          National   Refuges,   or  National   Fish\n          Hatcheries;\n            (vi)  Anadromous   fish  or  endangered\n          species; or\n            (vii)  Where the  environmental effects\n          are uncertain.\n          However, the existence of  one or more of\n          the above will not  automatically require\n          the submission of an environmental report\n          or  the  preparation of  an environmental\n          assessment  or  an  environmental  impact\n          statement.\n\n18  C.F.R.     380.4(b).44    HG&amp;E  argues  that  the NU-PSNH\n\nmerger might  \"alter mixes  of generation  in New  England by\n\nconstraining  the locations for new plants.\"   HG&amp;E points to\n\nthe language of 18 C.F.R.   380.4(b)(1)(ii) in support of its\n\nposition  that FERC was  compelled, at the  least, to explain\n\nwhy  it   was  not  obliged   to  perform  the   analysis  of\n\nenvironmental  effects required  by  NEPA.   HG&amp;E also  cites\n\nFERC's  decision  in  Southern   California  Edison  Co.,  49\n                                                        \n\nF.E.R.C.     61,091  (1989)   (holding  that    380.4(b)  was\n\ntriggered when approved merger would result in the dumping of\n\n                    \n\n44  HG&amp;E  does  not challenge  the  validity  of  any of  the\napplicable regulations cited above.\n\n                             -56-\n\nhundreds of tons of additional air contaminants into the most\n\npolluted air in the United States).\n\n          There was no evidence in the record of identifiable\n\nenvironmental harms that would likely result from the NU-PSNH\n\nmerger.  The  fact that new generating  facilities might wind\n\nup  in different locations than  would have been  the case in\n\nthe absence of  the merger does not approach in significance,\n\nbecause  its  significance  is  not quantifiable,  the  known\n\neffects of  the  merger between  Southern  California  Edison\n\nCompany  and San  Diego Gas  &amp; Electric  Company.   Thus, the\n\nfactual  situation presented in Southern California Edison is\n                                                          \n\ncompletely distinguishable from that of this case.\n\n          The   character  and   location   of   the   future\n\nenvironmental effects of the  NU-PSNH merger are so uncertain\n\nthat  no  meaningful  environmental  review would  have  been\n\npossible, even had  FERC made the effort.  Here, FERC was not\n\napproving  a  regional  development  plan.    It  was  merely\n\napproving a merger between utility companies, albeit a merger\n\ninvolving  two  of  the  largest utilities  in  New  England.\n\nEnergy  demand may increase in New England over the following\n\ndecades, and the fact  of the merger may influence  how those\n\nneeds  are met.  Nevertheless, any attempt by FERC to prepare\n\nan  EIS would  have involved  little more  than spinning  out\n\nmultiple  hypothetical  development forecasts,  with multiple\n\noptions  for   the  type,  amount  and   location  of  future\n\n                             -57-\n\ngenerating facilities.  See  Kleppe v. Sierra Club,  427 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n390, 401-2 (1976).  Once concrete plans have been established\n\nfor   the   construction   of  transmission   or   generating\n\nfacilities, those  proposals will  be reviewed under  NEPA or\n\nthe applicable state environmental review procedures.\n\n          FERC  was justified  in  deciding  that neither  an\n\nenvironmental   assessment   nor   an  environmental   impact\n\nstatement was required prior to approving the NU-PSNH merger.\n\n     G.   HG&amp;E's \"Unique\" Harm.\n\n          HG&amp;E also  contends that because it  relied on PSNH\n\nNew Hampshire  Corridor facilities for over  one-third of its\n\nelectricity supply,  it would be \"uniquely  threatened\" by NU\n\nin head-to-head competition for  large, industrial loads.  To\n\nprotect    itself,   HG&amp;E   requested   that   FERC   either:\n\n(1) disapprove  the merger;  (2) require  the  divestiture or\n\nrestructuring of  NU's retail  business in Holyoke  (HWP); or\n\n(3) grant  HG&amp;E  grandfather  rights to  PSNH  New  Hampshire\n\nCorridor transmission.  The ALJ rejected the \"drastic remedy\"\n\nof divestiture of HWP, stating that it was  \"wholly uncalled-\n\nfor  by anything in this record,\" and holding that HG&amp;E would\n\nbe  adequately  protected by  the  conditions  to the  merger\n\ndesigned   to   address   the  anticompetitive   effects   on\n\ntransmission dependent  utilities (\"TDUs\").   53  F.E.R.C. at\n\n65,232.\n\n          As the ALJ described,\n\n                             -58-\n\n          [t]he  Transmission  Dependent  Utilities\n          (TDUs) are  \"entirely dependent on  NU or\n          PSNH  for  their bulk  power transmission\n          needs.\"  These  companies (most of  which\n          involve municipal ownership) are  not big\n          enough  to  own  or construct  sufficient\n          generation to meet their loads.  As their\n          brief states, they \"are physically unable\n          to  engage in any  bulk power transaction\n                           \n          without using the NU or PSNH transmission\n          systems.  Absent  economic access to NU's\n          or  PSNH's  transmission facilities,  the\n          TDU  cannot  survive  as  an  independent\n          entity.\"   The  TDUs compete with  NU and\n          PSNH in the wholesale bulk  power market;\n          each   TDU,   like  NU/PSNH,   seeks  out\n          attractive sources of  supply.  TDUs thus\n          \"are in  the  uneasy position  of  having\n          their    only    source   of    essential\n          transmission  service  in  the  hands  of\n          their principal competitor.\"  These small\n          companies,    uniquely    vulnerable   to\n          possible  anticompetitive   conduct,  are\n          entitled  to  some measure  of protective\n          assurance regarding NU/PSNH's post merger\n          conduct.\n\n53  F.E.R.C. at 65,232-33.   The ALJ held  that \"[a]ll rates,\n\nterms and  conditions of NU/PSNH transmission  service to the\n\nTDUs in effect  on this date shall . .  . be maintained after\n\nthe merger,  unless and until changes are  either agreed upon\n\nby  the merged  company and  the TDUs,  or authorized  by the\n\nCommission.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,233.  In short, while finding\n\nthat  TDUs  were  \"uniquely  vulnerable\"  to  anticompetitive\n\nconduct by NU-PSNH,  the ALJ  found that HG&amp;E  had not  shown\n\nthat  it was  entitled to  protections beyond those  given to\n\nTDUs  generally.    The  Commission agreed,  56  F.E.R.C.  at\n\n62,049,  but bolstered the protection for TDUs ordered by the\n\n                             -59-\n\nALJ by imposing the additional condition  that NU establish a\n\nspecial tariff for TDUs.  Id. at 62,050.\n                             \n\n          HG&amp;E  points  to  no  evidence  in  the  record  to\n\nindicate  that it  faced anticompetitive consequences  of the\n\nmerger sufficiently  different in  character or magnitude  to\n\nwarrant greater  protections than those given  to other TDUs.\n\nWe therefore affirm the Commission's actions to protect TDUs,\n\nwhich were adequately explained and supported in the record.\n\n     H.   Modifications to the Filed Rate Schedules.\n\n          The Commission analyzed the Seabrook Power Contract\n\nand Capacity Interchange Agreements  filed by NUSCO under the\n\n\"just and reasonable\"  standard of    206 of  the FPA,45  and\n\nordered the  following modifications to  the rate  schedules:\n\n(1) deletion of the automatically adjusting rate of return on\n\nequity  provision  in  the   Seabrook  Power  Contract;   (2)\n\nreduction of the  rate of  return on equity  in the  Seabrook\n\nPower  Contract from  13.75 percent  to 12.53  percent;46 (3)\n\n                    \n\n45   Section  206(a)  of  the  FPA,  16  U.S.C.     824(e)(a)\nprovides:\n            Whenever the  Commission, after hearing\n          had  upon   its   own  motion   or   upon\n          complaint, shall find that any rate . . .\n          collected by any public  utility . . . is\n          unjust,        unreasonable,       unduly\n          discriminatory   or   preferential,   the\n          Commission shall determine  the just  and\n          reasonable  rate . . .  to be  thereafter\n          observed and in force, and shall  fix the\n          same by order.\n\n46   NUSCO did not appeal this modification.\n\n                             -60-\n\nNorth  Atlantic's decommissioning expenses under the Seabrook\n\nPower Contract  and any subsequent changes  thereto were made\n\nsubject to  review by  the Commission;  (4) reduction  in the\n\nrate  of return  on  equity  specified  in the  two  Capacity\n\nInterchange Agreements  from 14.50  percent to 13.17  percent\n\nfor the period from July 27, 1990 through August 8, 1991, and\n\nthereafter  to  12.93 percent;  and  (5)  the Seabrook  Power\n\nContract  could be modified  by the Commission  in the future\n\nunder the \"just and reasonable\" standard of   206 of the FPA,\n\nrather than the \"public  interest\" standard agreed to  by the\n\nparties.  56 F.E.R.C. at 61,993; 58 F.E.R.C. at 61,185.\n\n          Each  of the  three parties  to the  Seabrook Power\n\nContract (\"SPC\"), NU,  PSNH and the  State of New  Hampshire,\n\nwaived  its right to file  a complaint under    206 regarding\n\nthe rates contained in the agreement.  Section 12 of  the SPC\n\nalso provided that:\n\n          [E]ach [party] further agrees that in any\n          proceeding  by the FERC under Section 206\n          the  FERC  shall   not  change  the  rate\n          charged under this Agreement  unless such\n          rate  is found  to  be  contrary  to  the\n          public interest.\n\nNU argues  that the Commission  violated the  \"Mobile-Sierra\"\n                                                            \n\ndoctrine47 when  it  modified the  SPC  in disregard  of  the\n\nintent of the parties.\n\n                    \n\n47   This doctrine is based on the  companion cases of United\n                                                             \nGas Pipe Line  Co. v.

See  Papago\n                                                             \n\nTribal Utility Authority  v.

In Papago,\n                                                            \n\nthe court held  that, regardless of the  parties' intent, the\n\nCommission retained, in any event,\n\n          the indefeasible right . . . under    206\n          to replace rates that are contrary to the\n          public interest, \"as where  [the existing\n          rate   structure]    might   impair   the\n          financial ability of  the public  utility\n          to continue its  service, cast upon other\n          consumers  an  excessive  burden,  or  be\n          unduly discriminatory.\"\n\nPapago, 723 F.2d at  953, (quoting Sierra, 350 U.S.  at 355).\n                                         \n\nThe court  went on to  note that  \"unduly discriminatory\"  in\n\nthis  context  \"apparently  means  unduly  discriminatory  or\n\npreferential  to  the detriment  of  purchasers  who are  not\n\nparties to the contract.\"  Papago, 723 F.2d at 953 n.4.\n                                 \n\n          In  this case,  seemingly for  the first  time, the\n\nCommission held that it also had the\n\n                             -62-\n\n          authority   under  the   public  interest\n          standard to  modify a contract where:  it\n                                                   \n          may   be  unjust,   unreasonable,  unduly\n                                          \n          discriminatory  or  preferential  to  the\n          detriment  of  purchasers  that  are  not\n          parties to  the contract;  it is  not the\n                                                   \n          result  of arm's length bargaining; or it\n                                                   \n          reflects  circumstances where  the seller\n                                                   \n          has  exercised  market  power   over  the\n                                                   \n          purchaser.\n                   \n\n50  F.E.R.C. at 61,839 (emphasis added).  The ALJ interpreted\n\nthat holding as follows:\n\n          The  Commission  made clear  that  in the\n          particular circumstances  surrounding the\n          Seabrook  contract,  it  retains power   \n          through the \"public interest\"  language  \n          to    make   modifications    under   the\n          traditional   just  and   reasonable  and\n          nondiscrimination standards.\n\n53 F.E.R.C.  at  65,235.   The  standard established  by  the\n\nCommission, and  subsequently applied by  the ALJ,  conflates\n\nthe  \"just and  reasonable\" and \"public  interest\" standards,\n\nthereby  circumventing  the  Mobile-Sierra  doctrine.     The\n                                          \n\ndistinction  between the  \"just and  reasonable\" and  \"public\n\ninterest\"  standards  loses  its   meaning  entirely  if  the\n\nCommission may  modify a  contract under the  public interest\n\nstandard  where it  finds  the contract  \"may be  unjust [or]\n\nunreasonable.\"   The  parties'  express intent  was to  avoid\n\nreview  of  rate  schedules  under the  just  and  reasonable\n\nstandard.    Mobile-Sierra protects  their  right  to do  so,\n                          \n\nleaving the Commission  with the power  to modify rates  only\n\nwhen required by the public interest.\n\n                             -63-\n\n          The  Commission  found that  the  SPC  might unduly\n\ndiscriminate  against entities not  parties to  the contract,\n\nand that there was no genuine arm's-length bargaining because\n\nNU and PSNH negotiated the agreement at a time when they knew\n\nthey were about to  merge and have identical interests.   The\n\nCommission held  that, in  this context, it  could \"carefully\n\nscrutinize the  rates, terms and conditions  of the contract\"\n\nto determine if they were just.  Id.\n                                    \n\n          The Commission's  explanation for employing  a just\n\nand  reasonable  standard seems  to  us inadequate.    To the\n\nextent  the  Commission   is  relying  on   NU's  prospective\n\nownership of PSNH, it is unclear why the Commission should be\n\nconcerned    about   protecting   PSNH   from   a   perceived\n\ndisadvantageous arrangement imposed by its  prospective owner\n\nsince any disadvantage visited on  the prospective subsidiary\n\nwill be borne by its owner.  If NU chooses  to allocate risks\n\namong its operating subsidiaries  and one of its subsidiaries\n\nis  disfavored in  this calculation,  there would seem  to be\n\nlittle justification for the Commission stepping in on behalf\n\nof the disfavored subsidiary absent some threat to the public\n\ninterest.\n\n          As for the seller's  market power, reliance on this\n\nfactor  threatens  to  erode  the  Mobile-Sierra doctrine  so\n                                                \n\nsubstantially that  a fuller explanation  from the Commission\n\nis required before  proceeding down this  route.  After  all,\n\n                             -64-\n\nsome  measure of  market power  could be  present in  a large\n\nnumber  of  contracts.    A  case-by-case  inquiry  into  the\n\npresence  and extent of market  power would inject  a new and\n\npotentially  time-consuming  element  into the  Mobile-Sierra\n                                                             \n\nanalysis, and it is not entirely  clear in any event why  the\n\nCommission should protect a buyer who voluntarily enters into\n\nan agreement with a dominant seller.\n\n          The  most attractive case  for affording additional\n\nprotection, despite  the presence of a contract, is where the\n\nprotection is  intended to  safeguard the interests  of third\n\nparties,  notably the  buyer's customers.   The Mobile-Sierra\n                                                             \n\ndoctrine itself allows  for intervention by FERC  where it is\n\nshown  that the  interests of  third parties  are threatened.\n\nMobile,  350  U.S.  at  344-45;  Sierra,  350  U.S.  at  355.\n                                       \n\nHowever, the  standard to be  applied, as  formulated by  the\n\nSupreme  Court, is  the  protection of  outside parties  from\n\n\"undu[e] discriminat[ion]\"  or  imposition of  an  \"excessive\n\nburden.\"  Sierra,  350 U.S. at 355.  If  there is some reason\n                \n\nfor departing from this public interest standard as framed by\n\nthe Supreme Court, the Commission has not supplied it.\n\n          We  assume, without  deciding, that:   (1)  FERC is\n\ncorrect  in its assertion that the State of New Hampshire did\n\nnot adequately represent the  interests of non-parties to the\n\ncontract,  and  that,  therefore,  the SPC  may  have  unduly\n\ndiscriminated  against those non-parties; and (2) the alleged\n\n                             -65-\n\nlack of arms'-length bargaining among NU,  PSNH and the State\n\nof  New Hampshire gave  the Commission the  right to evaluate\n\nthe SPC.  We hold, however,  that the Commission was bound to\n\nfollow  the Mobile-Sierra  doctrine as explicated  by Papago,\n                                                            \n\nand therefore should have evaluated  the SPC under the public\n\ninterest standard, not the just and reasonable standard.\n\n          We  therefore remand this issue for reconsideration\n                              \n\nby FERC under the public interest standard.48\n\nIV.

BACKGROUND.\n\n     A.   Parties to the Approved Merger.\n\n          Northeast  Utilities (\"NU\") is a registered holding\n\ncompany under the Public Utility Holding Company  Act of 1935\n\n(PUHCA).  15 U.S.C.   79 et seq. (1988).  Northeast Utilities\n                                \n\nService Company (\"NUSCO\") is  a service company subsidiary of\n\n                             -7-\n\nNU   and  supplies  centralized  administrative  and  support\n\nservices to NU's operating companies.3\n\n          Prior to the merger,  Public Service Company of New\n\nHampshire (\"PSNH\")  was the  largest electric utility  in New\n\nHampshire, supplying  electric service to some 375,000 retail\n\ncustomers,  approximately  three-quarters   of  the   State's\n\npopulation, in every county in the State.  PSNH also provided\n\nwholesale service to the New  Hampshire Electric Cooperative,\n\nthree  New Hampshire  municipalities, and  one investor-owned\n\nutility,  Vermont  Electric  Power  Company.   PSNH  had  the\n\nlargest  ownership  share,  approximately  35.6  percent,  of\n\nSeabrook Unit  No. 1, a nuclear  generating facility declared\n\nto be available for service on June 30, 1990.\n\n     B.   The Merger Proposal.\n\n          On  January  28,  1988,  PSNH   filed  a  voluntary\n\npetition  in  the  United  States Bankruptcy  Court  for  the\n\nDistrict of New Hampshire for reorganization under Chapter 11\n\nof  the Bankruptcy Code.   11 U.S.C.    1101 et  seq. (1988).\n                                                     \n\nPSNH  alleged that it was unable to  recover in its rates the\n\noutlays  it had made in the construction and operation of the\n\nSeabrook  nuclear power  plant.   On  April  20, 1990,  after\n\n                    \n\n3    NU's operating companies are Connecticut Light and Power\nCompany  (CL&amp;P),  Western  Massachusetts   Electric  Company,\nHolyoke  Water  Power  Company (HWP)  and  HWP's wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, Holyoke Power and Electric Company (HP&amp;E).  These\ncompanies are wholly-owned subsidiaries  of NU and are public\nutilities supplying retail and wholesale electric service  in\nConnecticut and Massachusetts.\n\n                             -8-\n\nsifting through several  competing reorganization plans,  the\n\nbankruptcy court  approved NU's  proposal to merge  with PSNH\n\nand to  acquire and operate  all of PSNH's  power facilities.\n\nSee In re Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583333\"><a href=\"/opinion/583333/bankr-l-rep-p-74609-in-re-public-service-company-of-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                             \n\n470 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, Rochman v.

After  the merger, PSNH would be a\n\nwholly-owned  subsidiary   of  NU  and  would   transfer  its\n\nownership  interest   in  Seabrook  to  a   newly  formed  NU\n\nsubsidiary,   North   Atlantic  Energy   Corporation  (\"North\n\nAtlantic\").    The second  step  would occur  only  after all\n\nnecessary  approvals   were   received  from   the   relevant\n\nregulatory agencies.\n\n     C.   Procedural History.\n\n          On January 8, 1990, NUSCO, on behalf of NU and NU's\n\noperating subsidiaries, filed an  application with FERC under\n\nsection 203 of  the Federal  Power Act (\"FPA\"),  16 U.S.C.   \n\n824b (1988), seeking authorization for PSNH to dispose of all\n\nof its  jurisdictional facilities and  concurrently to  merge\n\nwith, and become  a subsidiary  of, NU.   In connection  with\n\n                             -9-\n\nthis application,  NUSCO filed four rate  schedules with FERC\n\npursuant to    205 of the FPA:  the Seabrook Power Contract,4\n\nthe   Sharing  Agreement5   and   two  Capacity   Interchange\n\nAgreements.6\n\n          The  Commission  consolidated consideration  of the\n\nmerger  application and  rate  schedules,  accepted the  rate\n\nschedules for  filing and suspended their  effectiveness, and\n\nset for  hearings before an administrative  law judge (\"ALJ\")\n\nthe questions  of whether the  Commission should grant  the  \n\n203  application  and  approve   the  rate  schedules.    See\n                                                             \n\nNortheast Utilities Service Co.,  50 F.E.R.C.   61,266, reh'g\n                                                             \n\ngranted  in part  and denied  in part,  51 F.E.R.C.    61,177\n                                     \n\n(1990).  In its order, the Commission directed the parties to\n\n                    \n\n4  The  Seabrook Power Contract  is a life-of-the-unit  power\nsales agreement between PSNH  and North Atlantic entered into\nconcurrently with  NU's acquisition of PSNH  and the transfer\nof PSNH's share  of Seabrook  to North Atlantic.   Under  the\ncontract, PSNH  agreed  to purchase  North Atlantic's  entire\nshare of Seabrook capacity and  energy, according to a  cost-\nof-service formula rate.  The contract was intended to ensure\nthat  North Atlantic would recover all of its costs from PSNH\nregardless of whether or not Seabrook actually operated.\n\n5   The Sharing Agreement allocates the benefits and obliga-\ntions from the  integrated operation of PSNH and  the current\nNU  system, as well as  the joint planning  and operations of\nthese  systems.   This  agreement established  a formula  for\nsharing the  expected post-merger benefits that  would accrue\nto NU and PSNH  operating companies as a result  of operating\nefficiencies  and  the  ability  to take  single  participant\nstatus under the NEPOOL agreement.\n\n6   The  two Capacity Interchange Agreements provide  for the\nsale  and purchase  of  energy between  PSNH and  Connecticut\nLight &amp; Power Company (CL&amp;P) over a ten-year term.\n\n                             -10-\n\naddress  the  effect of  the proposed  merger on  NU's market\n\npower and \"whether any transmission conditions  are necessary\n\nto eliminate any  adverse effect of the  proposed merger and,\n\nif  so,  what specific  conditions  should be  imposed.\"   50\n\nF.E.R.C. at 61,834-35.\n\n          On December  20, 1990,  the ALJ issued  its Initial\n\nDecision  approving  the     203  application  and  the  rate\n\nschedules   with   certain   modifications  and   conditions.\n\nNortheast Utilities Service Co., 53 F.E.R.C.   63,020 (1990).\n                               \n\nThe Commission, in Opinion No. 364, issued on August 9, 1991,\n\naffirmed in  part and  reversed in part  the ALJ's  decision,\n\nconditionally approving  the    203 application and  the rate\n\nschedules.

Background.\n                         \n\n          In reaching  his  decision to  approve the  NU-PSNH\n\nmerger,  the   ALJ  found  that  the   merger  would  produce\n\nsignificant benefits.  Specifically, he found that:  (1) PSNH\n\nwould emerge from bankruptcy  as a viable utility on  a solid\n\nfinancial  footing,  53  F.E.R.C.  at  65,211;  (2)  improved\n\nmanagement techniques and economies of scale would reduce the\n\noperating costs  of Seabrook by  some $527  million,7 id.  at\n                                                         \n\n65,212; (3) application of NU operating procedures  to PSNH's\n\nfossil steam plants would save  $100 million, id. at  65,213;\n                                                 \n\n(4) reductions in  administrative and general  expenses would\n\nsave  $124  million, id.;  (5) NU's  record of  buying lower-\n                        \n\npriced coal on the  spot market would save $39  million, id.;\n                                                            \n\nand (6) the merger would yield $360 million in savings for NU\n\nbecause of  its ability to elect  \"single participant status\"\n\n                    \n\n7   This, and all other dollar amounts are net present values\nunless otherwise noted.\n\n                             -13-\n\nin  the  New  England  Power  Pool  (NEPOOL),  a  power  pool\n\ncomprised of most of the utilities in New England.

Under the  authority of   203(b)  of the FPA, 16\n\nU.S.C.    824b(b), the  ALJ  approved the  merger subject  to\n\nseveral conditions, including the  following:  (1) the merged\n\ncompany  must  offer  firm  (non-interruptible)  transmission\n\nservice  for a minimum of 30 days  and a maximum of 20 years,\n\n53  F.E.R.C.  at  65,220-21;  (2) non-firm  service  must  be\n\noffered  for a one-day minimum  term, id. at  65,220; (3) the\n                                         \n\nmerger would be consummated concurrently with the filing of a\n\ncompliance tariff which fully reflects  all of the terms  and\n\nconditions set  out in  the ALJ's  Initial  Decision, id.  at\n                                                         \n\n65,221;  (4) NU  must  implement its  New Hampshire  Corridor\n\nProposal,8 thereby  making available  400 MW  of transmission\n\n                    \n\n8   The  New Hampshire Corridor Transmission  Proposal allows\nNew  England  utilities  to purchase  long-term  transmission\nrights from NU-PSNH in order to connect with power sources in\nnorthern New England and Canada.

Discussion.\n                         \n\n          Petitioners make two claims  with regard to  FERC's\n\nevaluation  of the costs and benefits  of the NU-PSNH merger.\n\nFirst,  they  argue  that  the  Commission  should  not  have\n\nincluded resolution of PSNH's bankruptcy as a  benefit of the\n\nmerger because:  (1) PSNH actually emerged from bankruptcy on\n\nMay 16, 1991, the  effective date of the  Reorganization Plan\n\n(\"RP\");  and  (2) prior  to  gaining  the bankruptcy  court's\n\napproval  of the two-step RP, PSNH  had to show that it would\n\nbe  financially  viable  as   a  stand-alone  entity  because\n\nregulatory approval  for the  second step  of the  RP (merger\n\nwith and into NU) was not assured.  These two facts, however,\n\ndo not  imply that  it was  error for  FERC  to consider  the\n\n\"resolution of PSNH's bankruptcy\" as  a benefit, indeed as  a\n\nprincipal benefit, of the merger.  \n\n          It  is  true  that  PSNH, as  a  technical  matter,\n\n\"emerged\" from  bankruptcy prior  to FERC's  consideration of\n\nthe proposed merger.  The ALJ and the Commission did not hold\n\notherwise.   The  ALJ  stated, and  the Commission  summarily\n\naffirmed the fact that \"[t]he merger is part of  a plan which\n                                                       \n\nenables a  reorganized PSNH to  emerge from bankruptcy.\"   53\n\nF.E.R.C. at 65,211  (emphasis added); see also 56 F.E.R.C. at\n                                              \n\n                             -18-\n\n61,993.  Like the state regulators  who approved the two-step\n\nmerger  plan, the Commission  evaluated the plan  as a whole,\n\nanticipating  \"the merger   not  `stand alone' PSNH    as the\n\nultimate destiny  for the reorganized company.\"   53 F.E.R.C.\n\nat 65,211.   \"All parties to  the reorganization contemplated\n\n[stand  alone]  status as  an interim  step  en route  to the\n\nmerger.\"  Id.   It was the entire  plan, which admittedly had\n             \n\ntwo  sequential and  severable  steps, that  allowed PSNH  to\n\nemerge  from bankruptcy.  There is no evidence that the state\n\nregulators would have approved a plan to allow PSNH to emerge\n\nfrom bankruptcy  that included  only the first  \"stand alone\"\n\nstep.  Indeed, there is evidence to the contrary.\n\n          FERC  also found that \"resolving\" PSNH's bankruptcy\n\nmeant  more  than  simply  the emergence  of  PSNH  from  the\n\nprotection of  bankruptcy court.   FERC held  that the  final\n\nresolution of PSNH's bankruptcy included the treatment of its\n\ncreditors and  stockholders who stood  to lose  approximately\n\n$250 million  in  the absence  of  the merger.    As the  ALJ\n\nobserved, the Commission \"regard[s] the right of these public\n\nbondholders as of primary importance after the consumers have\n\nbeen protected.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,211 (quoting In re Evans,\n                                                            \n\n1 F.P.C. 511, 517  (1937) (approving an acquisition involving\n\nthe reorganization  of a bankrupt utility)).   The Commission\n\nalso held that it was  in the public interest to  approve the\n\ncreation  of a  stronger, more  viable merged  entity, rather\n\n                             -19-\n\nthan leaving PSNH in a \"weakened\", \"stand alone\" state.  This\n\nholding was sufficiently supported by evidence in the record.\n\n          Petitioners also  claim that, given  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's   \"feasibility   finding\"  required   by   11  U.S.C.\n\n  1129(a)(11),12  the Commission  was estopped  from reaching\n\nthe  conclusion that a \"stand  alone\" PSNH would  be \"weak.\" \n\nWe disagree.   The  bankruptcy court  and FERC evaluated  the\n\nmerger proposal under  different standards.   The  bankruptcy\n\ncourt  was required  to determine  the likelihood  of further\n\nliquidation or reorganization proceedings were the plan to be\n\napproved.  FERC was obliged to determine whether the plan was\n\n\"consistent  with   the  public   interest.\"    It   was  not\n\ninconsistent for FERC to find that although PSNH was  capable\n\nof  surviving  as  a stand  alone  entity,  it  would not  be\n\n\"consistent  with the  public interest\"  to prevent  a merger\n\nthat  would  result   in  an  even  stronger  utility.    The\n\nprinciples of estoppel simply do not apply  in a case such as\n\nthis, where the issues litigated and the standards applied in\n\nthe two proceedings are so different. \n\n                    \n\n12   The Bankruptcy Code provides that:\n     (a)   The   court   shall  confirm   a   plan   [of\n     reorganization]  only  if   all  of  the  following\n     requirements are met:\n     (11) confirmation  of the plan is not  likely to be\n     followed  by  the  liquidation,  or  the  need  for\n     further financial reorganization, of the  debtor or\n     any successor to the  debtor under the plan, unless\n     such liquidation  or reorganization is  proposed in\n     the plan.\n  11 U.S.C.   1129(a)(11).\n\n                             -20-\n\n          Even were petitioners correct in their asseveration\n\nthat  FERC  improperly  counted  the  resolution   of  PSNH's\n\nbankruptcy  as a  benefit  of the  merger, \"the  Commission's\n\nerror would be immaterial in light of the overwhelming excess\n\nof other  benefits ($791  million) over  the costs  (0) still\n\nattributable . . . to the acquisition.\"   City of Holyoke Gas\n                                                             \n\n&amp; Elec.

At issue in this case is whether FERC is required by\n\nstatute,  or otherwise,  to  engage  in \"standard\"  antitrust\n\nanalysis before  passing on    203  merger applications.   In\n\nclaiming that  FERC has such an  obligation, petitioners rely\n\non a statute  governing agency approval of  bank mergers (the\n\n                             -21-\n\n\"Bank  Merger  Act\")  which   states  that  the  agency  with\n\njurisdiction over a proposed bank merger,13\n\n          shall not approve  \n             (A)  any  proposed merger  transaction\n          which  would result  in  a  monopoly,  or\n          which  would  be  in furtherance  of  any\n          combination  or conspiracy  to monopolize\n          or  to attempt to monopolize the business\n          of  banking in  any  part  of the  United\n          States, or\n             (B)   any    other   proposed   merger\n          transaction whose effect  in any  section\n          of  the country  may be  substantially to\n          lessen  competition, or to tend to create\n          a monopoly, or which in any  other manner\n          would be in restraint of trade, unless it\n          finds that the anticompetitive effects of\n          the  proposed   transaction  are  clearly\n          outweighed in the public interest  by the\n          probable  effects  of the  transaction in\n          meeting the convenience  and needs of the\n          community to be served. . . .\n          (6)   The    responsible   agency   shall\n          immediately  notify the  Attorney General\n          of any  approval by  it pursuant  to this\n          subsection    of   a    proposed   merger\n          transaction.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1828(c)(5)-(6).

We disagree.\n\n          As with  any matter  of statutory construction,  we\n\nfirst examine the language  of the statute.  Under  16 U.S.C.\n\n  824b(a),  the  Commission  is required,  after  notice  and\n\nopportunity  for hearing,  to  approve a  proposed merger  of\n\nutility  facilities if  it finds  that the proposal  \"will be\n\nconsistent  with  the  public interest.\"    That  is all  the\n\nstatute  says.  There  is no explicit  reference to antitrust\n\npolicies or principles.   There is no  evidence that Congress\n\nsought  to  have  the  Commission  serve  as  an  enforcer of\n\nantitrust  policy  in  conjunction  with  the  Department  of\n\nJustice and  the Federal Trade  Commission.  The  Bank Merger\n\nAct  reveals a  quite different  intention.   There, Congress\n\nexplicitly  set out  standards for  approval of  bank mergers\n\nthat incorporate  principles  embodied  in  the  Sherman  and\n\nClayton  Acts.   12  U.S.C.   1828(c)(5).   By  requiring the\n\nreviewing  agency  to  notify  the Attorney  General  of  any\n\ndecision  to approve  a  proposed bank  merger,  12 U.S.C.   \n\n1828(c)(6),  Congress  expressed  its  desire  to  have  bank\n\nregulators  serve as pre-screening  bodies of  mergers which,\n\nbecause of their importance or character, in most  cases also\n\ndeserve the attention of the Department of Justice.\n\n                             -23-\n\n          The Bank  Merger Act  carries with it  the implicit\n\npresumption that  mergers are  to be disapproved  (the agency\n\n\"shall not approve\" a  bank merger \"unless it finds  that the\n\nanticompetitive  effects are clearly outweighed in the public\n\ninterest\"  by   the  benefits   of  the  merger,   12  U.S.C.\n\n  1828(c)(5)).   The  FPA,  on the  other hand,  requires the\n\nCommission to approve any merger that is \"consistent with the\n\npublic  interest.\"     16   U.S.C.     824b(a).     Antitrust\n\nconsiderations   are,   of   course,   relevant   in   FERC's\n\nconsideration of  the \"public interest\"  in merger proposals.\n\nThe  statute,  however,  does  not require  FERC  to  analyze\n\nproposed mergers under the same standards that the Department\n\nof Justice or bank regulators must apply.\n\n          Although  the  Commission  must  include  antitrust\n\nconsiderations in its public interest calculus under the FPA,\n\nit is not  bound to use antitrust principles when they may be\n\ninconsistent  with the  Commission's  regulatory goals.   See\n                                                             \n\nOtter  Tail,   410  U.S.   at   373  (\"[a]lthough   antitrust\n           \n\nconsiderations  may be  relevant [in  determining  the public\n\ninterest], they are not determinative\").

Background.\n                         \n\n          NEPOOL is  a power  pool comprised  of most  of the\n\nutilities in New England.  The association is governed by the\n\nNew England  Power  Pool Agreement  (\"the  Agreement\")  which\n\nestablishes a \"comprehensive interconnection and coordination\n\narrangement\" among  its members in order  \"to achieve greater\n\n                             -25-\n\nreliability and economies in the  production of electricity.\"\n\nGroton v.

Cir.  1978).\n               \n\nSection  202(a)  of the  Federal  Power  Act encourages  such\n\nvoluntary  interconnection  and  coordination of  electricity\n\ngenerating facilities in order to achieve economies of scale.\n\n16  U.S.C.    824a; see  also 16  U.S.C.    824a-1 (regarding\n                             \n\npooling  agreements).  The Agreement  was approved as a filed\n\nrate  schedule  by  FERC's  predecessor,  the  Federal  Power\n\nCommission.   53 F.E.R.C. at  65,213.  Under  its terms, each\n\nmember  is  required  to   supply  the  pool  with  resources\n\n(\"Capacity Responsibility\") according to a formula based upon\n\nthe  relationship of the member's peak load to an estimate of\n\naggregate peak load of all members.\n\n          NU  experiences its  peak load  in the  summer, and\n\nPSNH experiences its peak load in the winter.  By aggregating\n\nthese two,  complementary, peak loads, NU-PSNH  can achieve a\n\nlower Capacity Responsibility than would  be the case if  the\n\ntwo   utilities  remained  separate.    Because  the  overall\n\ncapacity requirements of NEPOOL  will not change as  a result\n\nof the merger, the Capacity Responsibilities of other members\n\nmust rise to  make up  for the savings  accruing to  NU-PSNH.\n\nThe  ALJ  accepted  the  \"undisputed\" estimate  that  \"single\n\nparticipant status\" (SPS)  will result in a  shifting of some\n\n$360  million in costs from  NU-PSNH to other  members of the\n\npool.

Discussion.\n                         \n\n          Petitioners  offer six  arguments to  support their\n\nclaim that FERC erred  in failing to condition the  merger on\n\nwaiver of SPS by NU and PSNH.  First, petitioners  claim that\n\nthe Commission  did not  properly interpret the  provision of\n\nthe NEPOOL Agreement which  governs the election of SPS.   We\n\nagree with  the Commission's finding that  the Agreement both\n\nspecifically allows for the election  by NU-PSNH of SPS,  and\n\nencourages  such elections.    Section 3.1  of the  Agreement\n\nprovides in relevant part that:\n\n          All  Entities which  are controlled  by a\n          single person (such as a corporation or a\n          common law business  trust) which owns at\n          least seventy-five percent of  the voting\n          shares   of   each  of   them   shall  be\n                                               \n          collectively   treated    as   a   single\n          Participant   for    purposes   of   this\n          Agreement, if they elect  such treatment.\n          They are  encouraged to  do so.   Such an\n                                        \n          election shall  be  made by  signing  the\n          appropriate   form  at   the  end   of  a\n          counterpart of this Agreement.\n\n(Emphasis  supplied.)    Both  the  ALJ  and  the  Commission\n\ninterpreted section 3.1 to be  an explicit endorsement of the\n\nelection of  SPS by NU-PSNH.   The  ALJ stated that  \"[i]t is\n\nundisputed  that  NU  and   PSNH  qualify  for  such  [single\n\nparticipant]  status under  the Agreement.\"   53  F.E.R.C. at\n\n65,213.  The Commission  gave great weight to the  unrebutted\n\ntestimony  of  witness  Bigelow,   who  participated  in  the\n\nnegotiation of  the NEPOOL Agreement regarding  the intent of\n\nthe  original  signatories   to  the   Agreement  and   their\n\n                             -28-\n\nrecognition  of  such  potentially  large  cost-shifts  among\n\nNEPOOL members.  Bigelow stated:\n\n          [W]hen  we put  NEPOOL together  20 years\n          ago,  we  recognized  that  these  things\n          might happen.  This is not something that\n          snuck  up  on people. . . .   And  we did\n          discuss  at  length  what   would  happen\n          because . . . we were then coming up to a\n          potential   merger   of  Boston   Edison,\n          Eastern Utilities, New England Power.  It\n          was recognized that these kinds of things\n          could happen in the future and we spelled\n          out the ground rules and  recognized that\n          that would  happen when it happened.  And\n          the  people   who  didn't  like   it  got\n          something else for it.\n\n53  F.E.R.C.  at 65,214.   Both  the  ALJ and  the Commission\n\nrejected petitioners' claim on the basis of both the language\n\nof the Agreement, and Bigelow's unrebutted testimony that not\n\nonly  had the  signatories been  aware of such  a potentially\n\nlarge  savings  shift, but  that  those  utilities that  were\n\ndissatisfied  with this risk  received additional concessions\n\nas  compensation.    We  will not  disturb  the  Commission's\n\nfindings.\n\n          Second,  petitioners claim  that the  Agreement, as\n\ninterpreted in  NEPOOL Power Pool Agreement,  56 F.P.C. 1562,\n                                           \n\n1580 (1976), aff'd sub nom.

Cir. 1978), prohibits utilities with peak\n\nloads  in different  seasons  from  electing  SPS.    As  the\n\nCommission  explained,  this  argument  mischaracterizes  the\n\nAgreement and  the decision  of the Federal  Power Commission\n\n(\"FPC\") in NEPOOL.\n                 \n\n                             -29-\n\n          The NEPOOL Agreement, as  initially filed\n          and    as   approved,    allowed   single\n          participant    status    for    utilities\n          controlled by a single \"person\" owning at\n          least 75 percent of the voting shares  of\n          each utility.  An exception was expressly\n          allowed  in the  filed agreement  for any\n          Vermont  utility  which  elected   to  be\n          grouped   with  Vermont   Electric  Power\n          Company.  This exception was approved for\n          essentially two reasons:  (1) the Vermont\n          utilities  had  long  acted  as  a single\n          contiguous  integrated  electric  entity;\n          and (2) since  they all experienced their\n          peak loads in winter,  single participant\n          status would not give them a lower NEPOOL\n          Capability Responsibility (and consequent\n          savings).    A   broader  exception   was\n          denied, however, for a group of municipal\n          utilities (represented by MMWEC) that was\n          not entitled to single participant status\n          and  that lacked the two cited attributes\n          of the  Vermont utilities.  The basis for\n          the denial was that allowing  such status\n          for \"any group of systems, such as MMWEC,\n          could   well   be   detrimental  to   the\n          functioning of NEPOOL.\"\n             The  NEPOOL  decision, thus,  does not\n          stand  for  the  proposition that  single\n          participant status is  available only  to\n          utilities  having their peak loads in the\n          same  season.    Instead,   another  way,\n          indeed   the   primary   way,  in   which\n          utilities  may qualify  is  if  they  are\n          controlled  by a  single  person with  at\n          least 75-percent common ownership.   That\n          is the basis upon  which NU and PSNH will\n          presumably seek to  qualify if the merger\n          is  approved.   Such status  is expressly\n          allowed   under   the  NEPOOL   Agreement\n          regardless of when NU and PSNH experience\n          their peak loads.\n\n56 F.E.R.C. at 61,996-97.  The reasons  offered by the FPC in\n\nits  decision  to  grant  a  special  exception  for  Vermont\n\nutilities seeking SPS were  not intended to be, and  are not,\n\nconditions, in  addition to those  set out in  the Agreement,\n\n                             -30-\n\nwhich must be satisfied to elect SPS.  The FPC did not narrow\n\nthe scope of Section  3.1 to apply only to  utilities sharing\n\nthe  same peak  load  season; rather,  it  created a  special\n\nexception to the  75 percent rule  to accommodate the  unique\n\nsituation faced by Vermont utilities.\n\n          Third, petitioners  claim that FERC failed  to give\n\nproper consideration  to Section  4.2 of the  Agreement, \"the\n\ninterests of  other  pool members,  and  the purpose  of  the\n\nAgreement as  a whole.\"  Essentially,  petitioners argue that\n\nallowing  NU-PSNH  to  elect  SPS  would  violate  a  general\n\nprovision  of the  Agreement, which states  that participants\n\n\"shall  not . . . take  advantage of  the provisions  of this\n\nAgreement so  as to harm another Participant  or to prejudice\n\nthe  position  of any  Participant  in  the electric  utility\n\nbusiness.\"   We  reject  this argument  for the  same reasons\n\nexpressed   by  the  Commission   in  its   decision  denying\n\npetitioners' request for a rehearing:\n\n          [W]e  find more  relevance in  the NEPOOL\n          Agreement's   explicit   endorsement   of\n          single  participant  status  than in  the\n          agreement's  general  goal of  \"equitable\n          sharing\"   and  prohibition   on  members\n          \"taking  advantage\"  of the  agreement to\n          harm  or prejudice  other  members.   The\n          NEPOOL Agreement  specifically encourages\n          eligible    parties   to    seek   single\n          participant status;  the provisions cited\n          by  the  intervenors  are   general,  not\n          specific.      Construing   the   general\n          consistent  with  the  specific, we  find\n          single participant status for  the merged\n          company  consistent   with  an  equitable\n          sharing,  as  envisioned  by  the  NEPOOL\n\n                             -31-\n\n          Agreement, and not  violative of the  ban\n          on  taking  advantage of  the agreement's\n          provisions  to  harm  or prejudice  other\n          members.\n\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,189.   We agree with FERC's  interpretation\n\nof  the  Agreement.     The  NEPOOL  signatories   explicitly\n\nencouraged  qualified  members  to  seek  SPS,   indeed  they\n\ncontemplated that members that merged might choose to do just\n\nthat.   We agree  with the  Commission's construction  of the\n\nAgreement which avoids a direct conflict between Sections 3.1\n\nand 4.2, and instead gives both provisions reasonable effect.\n\n          Fourth, petitioners argue that failure to condition\n\nthe   merger  on   waiver  of   SPS  would   create  \"serious\n\ndisincentives\"   for  current   members  to   continue  their\n\nmembership  in NEPOOL,  and  that the  breakup  of NEPOOL  is\n\ncontrary to the public interest.  Petitioners imply that FERC\n\ndid not take seriously their complaints about SPS, but rather\n\nrested its decision  not to  require a waiver  solely on  the\n\nfact that the Agreement allowed the election of SPS.  This is\n\nsimply not so.\n\n          The  Commission reversed  the ALJ  on the  issue of\n\nwhether SPS savings  should be  counted as a  benefit of  the\n\nmerger.   The Commission  found that  because the  cost shift\n\namounted  to  a  zero-sum   transaction,  with  NU  and  PSNH\n\nbenefitting and the other members burdened dollar-for-dollar,\n\nthe shift could not  be counted as a  benefit of the  merger.\n\n                             -32-\n\n56  F.E.R.C. at 61,997.  Thus, the Commission did not dismiss\n\npetitioners' claims regarding SPS without thought.\n\n          Also,  the ALJ  found,  and the  Commission agreed,\n\nthat SPS was essential to the merger, and that the merger, as\n\nconditioned, was in the public interest.  FERC must approve a\n\nproposed merger if it is consistent with the public interest.\n\n16  U.S.C.    824b(a).    FERC  has  the  discretion  to  add\n\nconditions  to a proposed  merger to  ensure that  the merger\n\nwill, taken as a whole, be in the public interest.  16 U.S.C.\n\n   824b(b).    FERC  need  not, however,  explain  why  every\n\ncondition, or failure to  establish a condition is consistent\n\nwith the public interest when considered separately and apart\n\nfrom the entire transaction.  Petitioners seem to argue  that\n\nFERC was required by law to  state why it was consistent with\n\nthe  public interest  to  follow the  explicit  terms of  the\n\napproved fifteen  year-old  NEPOOL Agreement  rather than  to\n\ncondition  the  merger  on   waiver  of  a  membership  right\n\nestablished by the Agreement.   FERC had no such  obligation.\n\nIt need not have  explained why it failed to add a particular\n\ncondition  prior to approving  a merger.   The statute simply\n\nprovides that \"[t]he Commission may grant any application for\n\nan order under this section in whole or in part and upon such\n\nterms and conditions as it  finds necessary or appropriate to\n\nsecure the  maintenance of adequate  service and coordination\n\nin  the   public  interest  of  facilities   subject  to  the\n\n                             -33-\n\njurisdiction  of the Commission.\"   16 U.S.C.    824b(b).  In\n\nthis  case, the Commission  set forth a  reasonable basis for\n\napproving the  merger as consistent with  the public interest\n\nin light of the supplementary conditions the Commission found\n\nnecessary.   FERC  need not  have gone  further than  this to\n\nexplain  why it  failed  to place  further conditions  on the\n\nmerger.\n\n          Fifth,   petitioners   allege   that   FERC   acted\n\ninconsistently in  its  treatment of  the NEPOOL  Agreement's\n\nprovisions regarding  voting rights and SPS.   The Commission\n\nadopted  a  condition limiting  the  merged company's  NEPOOL\n\nvoting  rights to  prevent PSNH  and NU  from gaining  a veto\n\npower  in NEPOOL.  56  F.E.R.C. at 62,043-45.   FERC reasoned\n\nthat,  while   there  was   evidence  that   the  signatories\n\nanticipated  that  large   cost-shifts  would  accompany  the\n\nelection  of SPS in merger  situations, there was no evidence\n\nthat they anticipated the  voting rights implications of such\n\nmergers.   58 F.E.R.C.  at 61,189.   It was not,  contrary to\n\npetitioners' argument,  inconsistent as a matter  of logic to\n\ncondition voting rights where the Agreement was silent on the\n\nneed or lack of need to do so, while failing to condition SPS\n\nwhere the  Agreement explicitly favored the  election of SPS.\n\nFurthermore, it was not  an error of law to  condition voting\n\nrights while  leaving SPS  rights untouched.   Petitioners do\n\nnot  contest the Commission's decision to condition NU-PSNH's\n\n                             -34-\n\nvoting  rights.    We  will uphold  whatever  conditions  the\n\nCommission  imposes on  a proposed  merger  so long  as their\n\nnecessity is supported in the record by substantial evidence.\n\n          Finally,  petitioners  contend that  the Commission\n\n\"failed to  explain why  burdening other NEPOOL  members with\n\n$364 million in additional  costs with no offsetting benefits\n\nto them is consistent  with the public interest.\"   In making\n\nthis argument, petitioners imply that each and every piece of\n\na complex package of merger agreements and conditions must be\n\nable to  withstand \"public interest\"  analysis without regard\n\nto other pieces of the package or to other conditions imposed\n\nby  the  Commission.   Petitioners  also  imply that  if  any\n\nindividual or group is harmed by a piece of the package, that\n\nprovision is not in the public interest and must therefore be\n\nstricken  or modified.   Both  implicit arguments  are deeply\n\nflawed.\n\n          In  evaluating a  transaction  such as  the one  at\n\nissue  here, the  Commission  is required  to  find that  the\n\nentire transaction, taken as a whole,  is consistent with the\n\npublic interest.  16 U.S.C.    824b(a).  Each element of  the\n\ntransaction  need not  benefit  every  utility or  individual\n\nwhich might  be affected; rather, the  whole transaction must\n\nbe consistent with the interest of \"the public.\"  There is no\n\nreason  to  think  that  the interest  of  individual  NEPOOL\n\nmembers is  synonymous with  the \"public\"  interest.  As  has\n\n                             -35-\n\nalready been noted,  FERC may  add conditions  to a  proposed\n\nmerger before granting approval.   16 U.S.C.   824b(b).   The\n\nstatute  does  not  require,  however,  that  FERC  establish\n\nconditions so  that every effect of an  approved merger could\n\nwithstand the \"public interest\" test.\n\n          At  a less  theoretical level,  the ALJ  determined\n\nthat the NEPOOL savings  \"were a vital  part of the long  and\n\nstrenuous negotiations which culminated in the resulting PSNH\n\nreorganization plan,\"  and  the particular  savings  of  $146\n\nmillion   for  New   Hampshire   consumers  were   relied  on\n\nspecifically by the  State of New Hampshire in  approving the\n\nmerged company's rate package.   53 F.E.R.C. at 65,213.   The\n\nCommission accepted this  finding of the  ALJ, while, at  the\n\nsame time, it reversed  the ALJ's decision to count  the $360\n\nmillion as  a benefit of the merger.   58 F.E.R.C. at 61,997.\n\nThe fact that  the cost-shift was not a benefit to be counted\n\nin weighing the  benefits and  costs of the  merger does  not\n\nmean that  the election of SPS and the concomitant cost-shift\n\nis not in  the public interest.   Election of  SPS is in  the\n\npublic interest because it is a central element of the merger\n\nplan  which, viewed  as  a whole,  was  found by  FERC  to be\n\nconsistent  with  the public  interest  based  on substantial\n\nevidence in the record.  We approve the Commission's decision\n\nnot to condition the merger on waiver by NU of SPS.\n\n     C.   Timing of Merger's Consummation.\n\n                             -36-\n\n          In  the  proceedings before  the  ALJ,  NU proposed\n\nfiling  a transmission  tariff within  60 days  following the\n\nmerger.  Intervenors and Commission staff proposed the filing\n\nand  approval of  an  interim  transmission  rate.   The  ALJ\n\nrejected  both proposals  and  instead held  that the  merger\n\nwould  be  consummated upon  the  filing  of NU's  compliance\n                                        \n\ntariff.  He reasoned as follows:\n\n          I see no  need for  requiring one  tariff\n          (with potential for controversy, charges,\n          collections and refunds)  to be  followed\n          by  yet  another  tariff,  with  its  own\n          potential for still other disputes.\n             Avoiding  a  transitional period  will\n          make   it   unnecessary   to  require   a\n          transitional  tariff.    To achieve  this\n          result, consummation of  the merger  must\n          be conditioned on  the concurrent  filing\n          of  a  compliance   tariff  which   fully\n          reflects all of  the terms and conditions\n          set out in this Initial Decision.  Such a\n          condition should encourage  a prompt  and\n          fair compliance filing  because NU  could\n          not begin  to  reap the  merger  benefits\n          without it.\n\n53 F.E.R.C. at 65,221.  The Commission concurred:\n\n             We    believe    the   GTC    [General\n          Transmission   Conditions]  and   the  NH\n          Corridor  Proposal,  as modified  herein,\n          adequately    mitigate    the    merger's\n          anticompetitive effects without requiring\n          the adoption of the Merger Tariff.  Trial\n          Staff stated that the Merger Tariff would\n          make  service available  immediately upon\n          approval of the merger.   We believe that\n          the presiding judge accomplished the same\n          result  by  allowing consummation  of the\n          merger  when  NU  submits its  compliance\n          filing.\n             We further believe  that delaying  the\n          merger's    consummation    until     the\n          Commission   accepts    NU's   compliance\n\n                             -37-\n\n          submittal    for    filing    would    be\n          inappropriate   given   the   uncertainty\n          surrounding    issues   which    may   be\n          challenged   and   subject   to   further\n          litigation  in the  compliance proceeding\n          and  given our  commitment to  act before\n          the Merger Agreement's December  31, 1991\n          termination date.  We believe that NU and\n          PSNH are  entitled to  a prompt and  fair\n          resolution  of this  proceeding.   At the\n          same time the intervenors are entitled to\n          have service begin as soon  as practical,\n          together  with a  fair resolution  of any\n          disputes raised regarding NU's compliance\n          filing.  Accordingly, we believe  that it\n          is in the best  interests of all  parties\n          to allow NU to consummate the merger when\n          it submits  its  compliance filing.    We\n          shall also require  NU to begin  honoring\n          such  requests  for transmission  service\n          under the  GTC,  as modified  herein,  at\n          that  time.    Such transmission  service\n          will be  provided at  either the firm  or\n          non-firm  transmission rates  proposed in\n          NU's   compliance   filing,  subject   to\n          refund, and  without a refund  floor.  In\n          reviewing    NU's   filing    to   ensure\n          compliance  with  this  Opinion, we  will\n          hold  NU to a very high  standard.  As NU\n          itself  states, \"[i]f NU  fails to comply\n          with  the  letter   or  spirit  of   such\n          [Commission]  requirement,  NU  would  be\n          subject to summary judgment  with respect\n          to any aspect of its compliance filing.\"\n\n56 F.E.R.C. at 62,025.\n\n          Petitioners'  stated concern  is that,  by allowing\n\nthe  merger to be consummated prior to FERC's approval of the\n\ncompliance tariff, FERC did not provide a sufficient guaranty\n\nthat NU would provide transmission access that would mitigate\n\n                             -38-\n\nthe  merger's  anticompetitive  effects.14    Petitioners  do\n\nnot, however,  seek  to unravel  the  merger.   Rather,  they\n\npropose that any  cost shift under the  NEPOOL Agreement, see\n                                                             \n\ndiscussion in  Part III(B),  supra, be postponed  until after\n                                  \n\nthe compliance tariff is approved.  Petitioners complain that\n\nthe course chosen by FERC creates an incentive on the part of\n\nNU  to delay  proceedings on  the compliance  tariff, thereby\n\nmaximizing  competitive  advantage.   Petitioners do  not, of\n\ncourse,  point  out  that  their  proposal  would  create  an\n\nincentive  on  their  part to  delay  final  approval of  the\n\ncompliance tariff, thereby postponing the day when the NEPOOL\n\ncost shift will take effect.\n\n          The ALJ and the Commission carefully considered the\n\nalternatives before reaching their decisions.  The Commission\n\nheld that the anticompetitive effects of the merger  would be\n\nadequately  mitigated  by  the  dual  requirements   that  NU\n\nimmediately provide  transmission access upon  the filing  of\n\nits compliance  tariff, and  that any  fees  collected by  NU\n\nwould be subject to  refund without a refund floor.   Because\n\nNU  accepted  these  merger conditions,  the  Commission  can\n\nenforce NU's  promise to pay  such refunds if  the Commission\n\nfinds them to be appropriate.

We  hold that\n       \n\nFERC's exercise  of its  discretion was not  inappropriate in\n\nthese  circumstances.   FERC  did not  defer, as  petitioners\n\nsuggest,  consideration of the anticompetitive effects of the\n\nmerger  which  FERC  itself   identified.    The   Commission\n\nrecognized the effects, and dealt with them in a reasoned way\n\nwhich  balanced  the  competing  interests  of  all  parties.\n\nFERC's remedy  is not  unreasonable, and we  therefore affirm\n\nits order.\n\n     D.   Protection of Native Load Customers.\n\n          1.   Priority of Services.\n                                   \n\n                             -40-\n\n               a.   Background.\n                              \n\n          In its  merger  application, NU  made  a  voluntary\n\ncommitment   to   provide  wholesale   transmission  service,\n\nincluding third  party wheeling  service,15  for any  utility\n\nover  its existing transmission system.  At the same time, NU\n\nsought  to limit  this  obligation by  reserving an  absolute\n\npriority  for  power  purchases  on  behalf  of  native  load\n\ncustomers (whose  power  needs NU  is bound  by franchise  or\n\ncontract  to  meet).   The  ALJ  held  that  although NU  may\n\nreasonably give  native load service  priority over  wheeling\n\nservice if NU's transmission system had insufficient capacity\n\nto serve both, 53  F.E.R.C. at 65,221-222, NU could  not deny\n\nfirm  wheeling   requests  based  upon  the   reservation  of\n\ntransmission  capacity for  its  own non-firm  sales, id.  at\n                                                         \n\n65,225.  \n\n          In Opinion  No.  364, the  Commission balanced  the\n\ninterests of  native load customers and  third party wheeling\n\ncustomers  and  affirmed  the  ALJ's denial  of  an  absolute\n\npriority:\n\n          we  .  . .  deny  NU's  proposal to  give\n          higher priority to  its own non-firm  use\n          than  to third  party  requests for  firm\n          wheeling    in     allocating    existing\n          transmission  capacity.    In  no  event,\n          however, will  NU be required  to provide\n          firm third party wheeling service  out of\n          existing   transmission   facilities   if\n\n                    \n\n15   For a definition of \"wheeling\" see n.9, supra.\n                                                  \n\n                             -41-\n\n          reliability  of  service  to native  load\n          customers would be adversely affected.\n\n56  F.E.R.C. at  62,021 (footnote  omitted).   The Commission\n\nfound it \"reasonable to allow NU to reserve firm transmission\n\ncapacity  to  provide reliable  service  to  its native  load\n                              \n\ncustomers.\"  Id. (Emphasis in original.)\n                \n\n          On rehearing,  NU asked the  Commission to  clarify\n\nthe  scope of  the \"reliability\"  criterion.   The Commission\n\n\"reiterate[d] that under no circumstances will NU be required\n\nto provide firm wheeling service out of existing transmission\n\ncapacity where  doing so would impair  or degrade reliability\n\nof  service to native load customers.\"  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,199\n\n(emphasis  removed).   The  Commission  held  the concept  of\n\nreliability generally  encompasses the:   (1) reservation  of\n\ntransmission capacity to back  up large generating units; (2)\n\nprovision of generation reserves; and (3) coverage of certain\n\nfuture  needs.     As  to  the  coverage   of  future  demand\n\nrequirements, the Commission  specifically ordered that  \"any\n\ncapacity needed for reliability purposes  within a reasonable\n\nplanning horizon  must be offered  for wheeling use  until NU\n\nexpects  to need the capacity  for reliability reasons.\"  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 61,199-200.\n\n          Petitioners assert  that the  decision to accord  a\n\npriority to native load  over transmission load is arbitrary,\n\ndiscriminatory, and  anticompetitive.   They argue  that FERC\n\nneither  defined  nor  justified  the   priority  granted  by\n\n                             -42-\n\nallowing reservation of transmission capacity for native load\n\nservice  and  that  any  such  priority  creates  competitive\n\nadvantages for  NU.  We  hold that the  Commission adequately\n\ndefined and reasonably justified its decision to allow such a\n\nreservation  and  properly   addressed  the   anticompetitive\n\nconcerns raised by the intervenors.  \n\n               b.   Discussion.\n                              \n\n          Although the Commission reaffirmed the general rule\n\nthat  firm transmission service  should be  accorded priority\n\nover  non-firm  service, even  if  the  latter would  benefit\n\nnative load,    it nonetheless  allowed  NU to  reserve  firm\n\ntransmission capacity  needed to ensure reliability of native\n\nload  service and allowed the  use of this  capacity for non-\n\nfirm transactions.  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,196.  Thus, native load\n\nservice will receive  a \"priority\" over third-party  wheeling\n\nservice  in  allocating existing  transmission  capacity when\n\nreliability  of service  to  native load  would be  adversely\n\naffected.     The  Commission  specifically   qualified  this\n\npriority by requiring NU  to offer the capacity  for wheeling\n\nuse until NU needed  it to assure reliability to  native load\n\ncustomers.\n\n          There  is nothing arbitrary or discriminatory about\n\nFERC's decision.  It struck  a reasonable balance between the\n\ncompeting interests of native load customers and  third-party\n\nwheeling customers.  NU-PSNH is obligated to serve its native\n\n                             -43-\n\nload  customers.  In return for this obligation to serve, the\n\nnative load customers regularly bear the cost of transmission\n\nfacilities;  native load  customers pay  for them,  use them,\n\nplan  on them, and rely on them.   As the ALJ noted, \"[e]very\n\nNew England utility favors  its own native load.   Nothing in\n\nthe NEPOOL agreement requires  its members to surrender their\n\nnative load preference, and none do.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,222.\n\nThus,  \"NU should be allowed  to give priority  over safe and\n\nreliable service to its  native load customers using existing\n\ntransmission capacity  built to  serve those customers.\"   58\n\nF.E.R.C. at  61,199.   FERC explicitly defined  and justified\n\nthe challenged native load \"priority.\"\n\n          2.   Transmission Upgrades Pricing.\n                                             \n\n               a.   Background.\n                              \n\n          NU's commitment to provide third-party transmission\n\nservice   includes   the  obligation   to   build  additional\n\ntransmission facilities as necessary to  relieve transmission\n\nconstraints on  its system.   58  F.E.R.C.  at 61,204-10;  56\n\nF.E.R.C. at 62,021-24.   The issue  then becomes, how  should\n\nthe  cost  of  constructing  such  transmission  upgrades  be\n\nallocated.  The ALJ stated  that questions of cost allocation\n\nare  best  addressed  in  future  proceedings  regarding  the\n\nparticular   responsibilities   for  particular   facilities.\n\nNevertheless,  the ALJ  adopted  the \"but  for\" analysis  for\n\ndetermining responsibility proposed by NU witness Schultheis:\n\n                             -44-\n\n          [W]heeling customers must make a pro rata\n          contribution   whenever  the   facilities\n          would  not have been  needed but  for the\n          wheeling  transfers across  a constrained\n          interface.   This means that  NU's native\n          load customers pay for the new facilities\n          they  create  the need  for  and wheeling\n          customers  pay  for  the facilities  they\n          create the need for.\n\n53 F.E.R.C. at 65,223.  The ALJ also noted that the financial\n\nexposure of  transmission customers  was limited by  the cost\n\ncaps  to  which NU  was committed.16    Id. at  65,224.   The\n                                           \n\nCommission agreed that cost  questions should be litigated in\n\nthe context of a specific proposal,  and accepted the concept\n\nof  the \"but for\" test  as a framework  for ascertaining cost\n\nresponsibility and the  use of  the proposed cost  caps as  a\n\nreasonable  means of  limiting  the  transmission  customers'\n\nresponsibility for  future upgrades.  56  F.E.R.C. at 62,028-\n\n030.   The Commission reaffirmed that  decision on rehearing.\n\n58 F.E.R.C. 61,204-207.\n\n          Petitioners  contend that the  Commission failed to\n\nadequately  explain  the pricing  policy  it  will employ  in\n\npricing  transmission upgrades.  Basically, petitioners claim\n\nthe ruling is too ambiguous to determine whether, or how, the\n\n                    \n\n16  NU committed  to cap  cost responsibility  to \"(1)  those\nspecific facilities  identified  by NU  at  the time  of  the\nwheeling request as needing to be built or upgraded either at\nthe time of the request or in the future; and (2) the maximum\ndollar  amount  contained  in  NU's  initial  estimate  of  a\nwheeling customer's pro  rata share  of the  costs of  future\nupgrades  needed  to  accommodate   a  request  for  wheeling\nservice.\"  \n56 F.E.R.C. at 62,031-32.\n\n                             -45-\n\nCommission changed its  policy from the traditional  \"rolled-\n\nin\" approach used  in pricing transmission service.   We hold\n\nthat   the  Commission   provided   a  clear   and   reasoned\n\njustification for  the principles that will  guide its future\n\ndeterminations of  transmission upgrade  pricing.  We  affirm\n\nthe Commission's decision not  to modify the basic principles\n\nadopted in its order.\n\n               b.   Discussion.\n                              \n\n          In accepting as reasonable  the \"but for\" test, the\n\nCommission  has  done no  more than  approve a  framework for\n\ndetermining  cost responsibility  which furthers  the general\n\nprinciple that  transmission costs  should be borne  by those\n\nentities  responsible  for the  cost.    58 F.E.R.C.  61,205.\n\nUnder  this test,  incremental  cost pricing  could be  found\n\nappropriate when firm wheeling across  a particular interface\n\nwould  degrade reliability absent  upgrades.   The Commission\n\nspecifically declined, however, to answer the requests of the\n\nintervenors  to  decide  the \"rolled-in  versus  incremental\"\n\nrate17 issue in  the abstract and  chose instead to  evaluate\n\nit only within the  context of a particular rate  proposal or\n\nupgrade.  Id.   The Commission articulated  how it envisioned\n             \n\n                    \n\n17  Under \"rolled  in\" pricing principles, the upgrade  costs\nwould  be rolled in with  other company costs  and charged to\nall ratepayers as part of NU's  general rate structure; while\nadministratively   simple,   it   ignores  any   concept   of\nresponsibility.  Thus, incremental pricing principles look to\nhold parties responsible for their share of upgrade costs.\n\n                             -46-\n\npricing  transmission  upgrades   and  adopted  a   condition\n\nlimiting  the  amount  NU  may  propose  to  collect  from  a\n\ntransmission customer to the greater of \n\n          (1) the incremental  cost of new  network\n          facilities  required  at  the   time  the\n          customer's new transmission load is added\n          or (2) the rolled-in cost of  all network\n          facilities required to serve the combined\n          transmission loads of [NU], including any\n          required transmission additions.\n\nId. at 61,206.   Thus, a wheeling customer may be charged the\n   \n\ngreater of rolled-in cost rates or incremental cost rates.   \n\n          The Commission acknowledged  that the  introduction\n\nof incremental  cost pricing  principles is a  departure from\n\nits  traditional pricing  policies18 and  justified  this new\n\npolicy  on NU's  unprecedented  obligation  to provide  third\n\nparty transmission service.

The  Commission noted that\n                                 \n\nincremental  cost  pricing  may  be  appropriate  in  certain\n\ncircumstances,  but  decided to  leave  the  details of  cost\n\nresponsibility  questions to  a  future specific  section 205\n\nrate case.  When such a  case arises, NU will bear the burden\n\nof   justifying  \"any   direct  assignments   of   costs  and\n\nsupport[ing] any arguments that  reliability is degraded by a\n\nparticular  firm transmission  service.    No presumption  is\n\n                    \n\n18     The  Commission generally  has  adhered to  rolled  in\npricing,   but  has   never  precluded   particularized  cost\nallocations to  specific  customers where  appropriate.

The Commission also allowed\n\nthat  any  reliance by  NU  upon the  \"but  for\" test  may be\n\nchallenged in  future actions.   The Commission  sufficiently\n\nexplained and  justified the  principles that will  guide its\n\ntransmission upgrade pricing.\n\n     E.   Opportunity Cost Pricing.\n\n          As has already been discussed, the Commission found\n\nit necessary to impose a number of conditions on the proposed\n\nNU-PSNH merger to mitigate  the merged company's market power\n\nin the  markets for  transmission and short-term  bulk power.\n\n58 F.E.R.C.  at 61,195.    Specifically, the  Commission held\n\nthat  NU  must  provide  firm  transmission  service  out  of\n\nexisting  capacity  for  any   utility,  subject  only  to  a\n\nreservation  of  sufficient  capacity  to  maintain  reliable\n\nservice to its  native load customers  and to honor  existing\n\ncontractual obligations.   NU was  prohibited, however,  from\n\ndenying a request for  firm transmission service by reserving\n\ncapacity for  non-firm transactions  that would enable  it to\n\nprovide more economical service to its native load customers.\n\n56 F.E.R.C.  at 62,014-21;  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,196-200.   FERC\n\nalso  held   that  NU  must  build   additional  transmission\n\nfacilities   as   needed   to   provide   transmission  where\n\ninsufficient capacity  exists.  56 F.E.R.C.  at 62,021-24; 58\n\n                             -48-\n\nF.E.R.C. at 61,204-10.   The Commission found that  these and\n\nother conditions  would  \"adequately mitigate\"  the  merger's\n\nanticompetitive effects.  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,213.\n\n          On rehearing, NU and  the States of Connecticut and\n\nNew Hampshire  argued that the Commission  should address the\n\nissue of  firm transmission  pricing because, in  Opinion No.\n\n364, FERC  had established  principles governing  the related\n\nissue of  firm transmission priority which  made NU's ability\n\nto purchase  inexpensive power (which would lower its cost of\n\nserving  its  native  load  customers)  subordinate  to   its\n\nobligation  to provide  firm transmission for  third parties.\n\n58  F.E.R.C.  at  61,201-02.    The  Commission  agreed,  but\n\ndeclined  to approve  \"opportunity  cost  pricing\"19  outside\n\nthe  context of  a specific  tariff proposal.   Instead,  the\n\nCommission announced three \"basic  goals\" to guide its future\n\ndecisions on the  pricing of firm transmission service on the\n\nmerged company's existing capacity, and left the door open to\n\nNU  to propose  a tariff  based on  opportunity costs  or any\n\n                    \n\n19   As the Commission explained, opportunity costs\n          are the  revenues lost or  costs incurred\n          by  a  utility  in providing  third-party\n          transmission  service  when  transmission\n          capacity is insufficient to  satisfy both\n          a  third-party  wheeling request  and the\n          utility's   own   use.     For   example,\n          opportunity   costs  might   include  the\n          revenues lost or costs incurred because a\n          utility  must  reduce its  own off-system\n          purchases or sales in order to overcome a\n          constraint on the [transmission] grid.\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,200-201.\n\n                             -49-\n\nother  methodology  that would  meet  the three  goals.   The\n\nCommission explained its decision as follows:\n\n            We are now confronted with the need  to\n          provide   NU   with  enough   specificity\n          regarding  what it  will  be  allowed  to\n          propose for the  pricing of future third-\n          party  wheeling  service,  so   that  the\n          company  can  decide  whether to  proceed\n          with the  merger.  We also  cannot ignore\n          the  need  to  act  as  expeditiously  as\n          possible  given the  commercial realities\n          and time pressures presented in corporate\n          matters subject to our  jurisdiction, and\n          in  particular  the  need  to  resolve  a\n          bankruptcy situation.   At the  same time\n          we are confronted with the need to ensure\n          an  adequate record on pricing issues and\n          to   afford   all  parties   an  adequate\n          opportunity to voice their objections.\n            Balancing  these  respective needs,  we\n          conclude  that  the  best  course  is  to\n          provide guidance on  pricing issues,  but\n          to defer specific  pricing issues to  the\n          compliance phase of  this proceeding,  or\n          to subsequent cases where  the Commission\n          may consider specific  proposals from  NU\n          in a concrete, factual setting and with a\n          more developed record.\n          . . . .\n          First, the  native load customers  of the\n                                                   \n          utility  providing  transmission  service\n                                                   \n          should   be   held  harmless.     Second,\n                                                   \n          transmission customers  should be charged\n                                                   \n          the lowest reasonable cost-based rate for\n                                                   \n          third-party transmission service.  Third,\n                                                   \n          the pricing should prevent the collection\n                                                   \n          of  monopoly  rents  by the  transmission\n                                                   \n          owner and  promote efficient transmission\n                                                   \n          decisions.      In  ruling   on  specific\n                   \n          proposed  rates,  we  will balance  these\n          three  goals  in light  of the  facts and\n          circumstances presented at that time.   \n\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,203 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).\n\n          FERC  was careful  to  point out  that it  endorsed\n\nopportunity cost pricing  only insofar as NU  could show that\n\n                             -50-\n\nit could \"propose rates which  include legitimate, verifiable\n\nopportunity costs.\"  Id.   The Commission warned NU  that any\n                        \n\nsuch  proposal would  be carefully  scrutinized and  would be\n\nsubject to challenge.  Id. at 61,203-04.  Specifically,  FERC\n                          \n\nstated that  NU would  have to  address the  following issues\n\nshould it seek recovery of opportunity costs:\n\n          (1) whether opportunity  costs should  be\n          capped by incremental expansion  costs or\n          any  other  cap;   (2)  whether   current\n          wheeling   and   wholesale   requirements\n          customers  should be  treated differently\n          from   future   wheeling  and   wholesale\n          requirements    customers,    e.g.,    by\n                                            \n          receiving    \"grandfather\"   rights    to\n          embedded cost  rates  for the  amount  of\n          transmission  capacity they  already use;\n          (3) how NU  will identify those customers\n          responsible for growth on its  system and\n          what   particular   new  facilities   are\n          necessary to accommodate that growth; (4)\n          whether  and how third  parties should be\n          protected   from   uncertainty  regarding\n          fluctuations  in  opportunity costs;  (5)\n          how  the proposed rates  will prevent the\n          collection of monopoly rents; and (6) how\n          the  proposed  opportunity costs  will be\n          verified.\n\nId.    The Commission  expressly  postponed consideration  of\n   \n\nwhether opportunity cost pricing  would be inconsistent  with\n\nnondiscriminatory  pricing  and  nondiscriminatory terms  and\n\nconditions of  service until  those issues  were raised  in a\n\nconcrete factual context.  Id. at 61,204, n.118.\n                              \n\n          Petitioners claim that FERC's decision  amounted to\n\nan arbitrary endorsement of opportunity cost pricing that was\n\nnot  supported  by evidence  in  the  record, was  inherently\n\n                             -51-\n\ndiscriminatory, and contrary to FERC's  regulation of natural\n\ngas pipelines.   Petitioners' underlying concern  seems to be\n\nthat  when  the  issue arises  next  in  the  context of  the\n\nCommission's  review  of NU's  compliance  tariff, FERC  will\n\nsimply approve the tariff and dismiss petitioners' objections\n\non the  ground that  opportunity cost pricing  principles had\n\nalready  been  endorsed  by  the  Commission.    Although  we\n\nunderstand petitioners' concerns,  we believe  that they  are\n\nmisplaced and that FERC did not go as far as petitioners fear\n\nin endorsing opportunity cost pricing.\n\n          Petitioners will have an opportunity to contest any\n\ncompliance tariff proposed by NU.  The Commission itself laid\n\nout a number of issues which NU would have to address were it\n\nto  propose a tariff based on opportunity costs.  58 F.E.R.C.\n\nat 61,203.   Only  after carefully considering  the competing\n\ninterests of providing  guidance to  NU as to  what kinds  of\n\ntariffs it would consider, and  the need to endorse  specific\n\nmethodologies only on the  basis of a fully-developed record,\n\ndid  the Commission  decide  to outline  broad pricing  goals\n\nwhich would allow  for a number of pricing  schemes including\n\nopportunity  cost pricing.  Id.   It was  squarely within the\n                               \n\nCommission's  power  to defer  consideration  of petitioners'\n\nassertions until  after NU filed  its compliance tariff.   As\n\nthe  Supreme  Court  has  held,  \"[a]n  agency  enjoys  broad\n\ndiscretion in determining how  to handle related yet discrete\n\n                             -52-\n\nissues  in  terms  of  procedures, and  priorities.\"    Mobil\n                                                             \n\nExploration   &amp;   Producing   Southeast,   Inc.   v.

HG&amp;E also  cites\n\nFERC's  decision  in  Southern   California  Edison  Co.,  49\n                                                        \n\nF.E.R.C.     61,091  (1989)   (holding  that    380.4(b)  was\n\ntriggered when approved merger would result in the dumping of\n\n                    \n\n20  HG&amp;E  does  not challenge  the  validity  of  any of  the\napplicable regulations cited above.\n\n                             -56-\n\nhundreds of tons of additional air contaminants into the most\n\npolluted air in the United States).\n\n          There was no evidence in the record of identifiable\n\nenvironmental harms that would likely result from the NU-PSNH\n\nmerger.  The  fact that new generating  facilities might wind\n\nup  in different locations than  would have been  the case in\n\nthe absence of  the merger does not approach in significance,\n\nbecause  its  significance  is  not quantifiable,  the  known\n\neffects of  the  merger between  Southern  California  Edison\n\nCompany  and San  Diego Gas  &amp; Electric  Company.   Thus, the\n\nfactual  situation presented in Southern California Edison is\n                                                          \n\ncompletely distinguishable from that of this case.\n\n          The   character  and   location   of   the   future\n\nenvironmental effects of the  NU-PSNH merger are so uncertain\n\nthat  no  meaningful  environmental  review would  have  been\n\npossible, even had  FERC made the effort.  Here, FERC was not\n\napproving  a  regional  development  plan.    It  was  merely\n\napproving a merger between utility companies, albeit a merger\n\ninvolving  two  of  the  largest utilities  in  New  England.\n\nEnergy  demand may increase in New England over the following\n\ndecades, and the fact  of the merger may influence  how those\n\nneeds  are met.  Nevertheless, any attempt by FERC to prepare\n\nan  EIS would  have involved  little more  than spinning  out\n\nmultiple  hypothetical  development forecasts,  with multiple\n\noptions  for   the  type,  amount  and   location  of  future\n\n                             -57-\n\ngenerating facilities.

Once concrete plans have been established\n\nfor   the   construction   of  transmission   or   generating\n\nfacilities, those  proposals will  be reviewed under  NEPA or\n\nthe applicable state environmental review procedures.\n\n          FERC  was justified  in  deciding  that neither  an\n\nenvironmental   assessment   nor   an  environmental   impact\n\nstatement was required prior to approving the NU-PSNH merger.\n\n     G.   HG&amp;E's \"Unique\" Harm.\n\n          HG&amp;E also  contends that because it  relied on PSNH\n\nNew Hampshire  Corridor facilities for over  one-third of its\n\nelectricity supply,  it would be \"uniquely  threatened\" by NU\n\nin head-to-head competition for  large, industrial loads.  To\n\nprotect    itself,   HG&amp;E   requested   that   FERC   either:\n\n(1) disapprove  the merger;  (2) require  the  divestiture or\n\nrestructuring of  NU's retail  business in Holyoke  (HWP); or\n\n(3) grant  HG&amp;E  grandfather  rights to  PSNH  New  Hampshire\n\nCorridor transmission.  The ALJ rejected the \"drastic remedy\"\n\nof divestiture of HWP, stating that it was  \"wholly uncalled-\n\nfor  by anything in this record,\" and holding that HG&amp;E would\n\nbe  adequately  protected by  the  conditions  to the  merger\n\ndesigned   to   address   the  anticompetitive   effects   on\n\ntransmission dependent  utilities (\"TDUs\").   53  F.E.R.C. at\n\n65,232.\n\n          As the ALJ described,\n\n                             -58-\n\n          [t]he  Transmission  Dependent  Utilities\n          (TDUs) are  \"entirely dependent on  NU or\n          PSNH  for  their bulk  power transmission\n          needs.\"  These  companies (most of  which\n          involve municipal ownership) are  not big\n          enough  to  own  or construct  sufficient\n          generation to meet their loads.  As their\n          brief states, they \"are physically unable\n          to  engage in any  bulk power transaction\n                           \n          without using the NU or PSNH transmission\n          systems.  Absent  economic access to NU's\n          or  PSNH's  transmission facilities,  the\n          TDU  cannot  survive  as  an  independent\n          entity.\"   The  TDUs compete with  NU and\n          PSNH in the wholesale bulk  power market;\n          each   TDU,   like  NU/PSNH,   seeks  out\n          attractive sources of  supply.  TDUs thus\n          \"are in  the  uneasy position  of  having\n          their    only    source   of    essential\n          transmission  service  in  the  hands  of\n          their principal competitor.\"  These small\n          companies,    uniquely    vulnerable   to\n          possible  anticompetitive   conduct,  are\n          entitled  to  some measure  of protective\n          assurance regarding NU/PSNH's post merger\n          conduct.\n\n53  F.E.R.C. at 65,232-33.   The ALJ held  that \"[a]ll rates,\n\nterms and  conditions of NU/PSNH transmission  service to the\n\nTDUs in effect  on this date shall . .  . be maintained after\n\nthe merger,  unless and until changes are  either agreed upon\n\nby  the merged  company and  the TDUs,  or authorized  by the\n\nCommission.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,233.  In short, while finding\n\nthat  TDUs  were  \"uniquely  vulnerable\"  to  anticompetitive\n\nconduct by NU-PSNH,  the ALJ  found that HG&amp;E  had not  shown\n\nthat  it was  entitled to  protections beyond those  given to\n\nTDUs  generally.    The  Commission agreed,  56  F.E.R.C.  at\n\n62,049,  but bolstered the protection for TDUs ordered by the\n\n                             -59-\n\nALJ by imposing the additional condition  that NU establish a\n\nspecial tariff for TDUs.  Id. at 62,050.\n                             \n\n          HG&amp;E  points  to  no  evidence  in  the  record  to\n\nindicate  that it  faced anticompetitive consequences  of the\n\nmerger sufficiently  different in  character or magnitude  to\n\nwarrant greater  protections than those given  to other TDUs.\n\nWe therefore affirm the Commission's actions to protect TDUs,\n\nwhich were adequately explained and supported in the record.\n\n     H.   Modifications to the Filed Rate Schedules.\n\n          The Commission analyzed the Seabrook Power Contract\n\nand Capacity Interchange Agreements  filed by NUSCO under the\n\n\"just and reasonable\"  standard of    206 of  the FPA,21  and\n\nordered the  following modifications to  the rate  schedules:\n\n(1) deletion of the automatically adjusting rate of return on\n\nequity  provision  in  the   Seabrook  Power  Contract;   (2)\n\nreduction of the  rate of  return on equity  in the  Seabrook\n\nPower  Contract from  13.75 percent  to 12.53  percent;22 (3)\n\n                    \n\n21   Section  206(a)  of  the  FPA,  16  U.S.C.     824(e)(a)\nprovides:\n            Whenever the  Commission, after hearing\n          had  upon   its   own  motion   or   upon\n          complaint, shall find that any rate . . .\n          collected by any public  utility . . . is\n          unjust,        unreasonable,       unduly\n          discriminatory   or   preferential,   the\n          Commission shall determine  the just  and\n          reasonable  rate . . .  to be  thereafter\n          observed and in force, and shall  fix the\n          same by order.\n\n22   NUSCO did not appeal this modification.\n\n                             -60-\n\nNorth  Atlantic's decommissioning expenses under the Seabrook\n\nPower Contract  and any subsequent changes  thereto were made\n\nsubject to  review by  the Commission;  (4) reduction  in the\n\nrate  of return  on  equity  specified  in the  two  Capacity\n\nInterchange Agreements  from 14.50  percent to 13.17  percent\n\nfor the period from July 27, 1990 through August 8, 1991, and\n\nthereafter  to  12.93 percent;  and  (5)  the Seabrook  Power\n\nContract  could be modified  by the Commission  in the future\n\nunder the \"just and reasonable\" standard of   206 of the FPA,\n\nrather than the \"public  interest\" standard agreed to  by the\n\nparties.  56 F.E.R.C. at 61,993; 58 F.E.R.C. at 61,185.\n\n          Each  of the  three parties  to the  Seabrook Power\n\nContract (\"SPC\"), NU,  PSNH and the  State of New  Hampshire,\n\nwaived  its right to file  a complaint under    206 regarding\n\nthe rates contained in the agreement.

The ALJ interpreted\n\nthat holding as follows:\n\n          The  Commission  made clear  that  in the\n          particular circumstances  surrounding the\n          Seabrook  contract,  it  retains power   \n          through the \"public interest\"  language  \n          to    make   modifications    under   the\n          traditional   just  and   reasonable  and\n          nondiscrimination standards.\n\n53 F.E.R.C.  at  65,235.   The  standard established  by  the\n\nCommission, and  subsequently applied by  the ALJ,  conflates\n\nthe  \"just and  reasonable\" and \"public  interest\" standards,\n\nthereby  circumventing  the  Mobile-Sierra  doctrine.     The\n                                          \n\ndistinction  between the  \"just and  reasonable\" and  \"public\n\ninterest\"  standards  loses  its   meaning  entirely  if  the\n\nCommission may  modify a  contract under the  public interest\n\nstandard  where it  finds  the contract  \"may be  unjust [or]\n\nunreasonable.\"   The  parties'  express intent  was to  avoid\n\nreview  of  rate  schedules  under the  just  and  reasonable\n\nstandard.    Mobile-Sierra protects  their  right  to do  so,\n                          \n\nleaving the Commission  with the power  to modify rates  only\n\nwhen required by the public interest.\n\n                             -63-\n\n          The  Commission  found that  the  SPC  might unduly\n\ndiscriminate  against entities not  parties to  the contract,\n\nand that there was no genuine arm's-length bargaining because\n\nNU and PSNH negotiated the agreement at a time when they knew\n\nthey were about to  merge and have identical interests.   The\n\nCommission held  that, in  this context, it  could \"carefully\n\nscrutinize the  rates, terms and conditions  of the contract\"\n\nto determine if they were just.  Id.\n                                    \n\n          The Commission's  explanation for employing  a just\n\nand  reasonable  standard seems  to  us inadequate.    To the\n\nextent  the  Commission   is  relying  on   NU's  prospective\n\nownership of PSNH, it is unclear why the Commission should be\n\nconcerned    about   protecting   PSNH   from   a   perceived\n\ndisadvantageous arrangement imposed by its  prospective owner\n\nsince any disadvantage visited on  the prospective subsidiary\n\nwill be borne by its owner.  If NU chooses  to allocate risks\n\namong its operating subsidiaries  and one of its subsidiaries\n\nis  disfavored in  this calculation,  there would seem  to be\n\nlittle justification for the Commission stepping in on behalf\n\nof the disfavored subsidiary absent some threat to the public\n\ninterest.\n\n          As for the seller's  market power, reliance on this\n\nfactor  threatens  to  erode  the  Mobile-Sierra doctrine  so\n                                                \n\nsubstantially that  a fuller explanation  from the Commission\n\nis required before  proceeding down this  route.  After  all,\n\n                             -64-\n\nsome  measure of  market power  could be  present in  a large\n\nnumber  of  contracts.    A  case-by-case  inquiry  into  the\n\npresence  and extent of market  power would inject  a new and\n\npotentially  time-consuming  element  into the  Mobile-Sierra\n                                                             \n\nanalysis, and it is not entirely  clear in any event why  the\n\nCommission should protect a buyer who voluntarily enters into\n\nan agreement with a dominant seller.\n\n          The  most attractive case  for affording additional\n\nprotection, despite  the presence of a contract, is where the\n\nprotection is  intended to  safeguard the interests  of third\n\nparties,  notably the  buyer's customers.   The Mobile-Sierra\n                                                             \n\ndoctrine itself allows  for intervention by FERC  where it is\n\nshown  that the  interests of  third parties  are threatened.\n\nMobile,  350  U.S.  at  344-45;  Sierra,  350  U.S.  at  355.\n                                       \n\nHowever, the  standard to be  applied, as  formulated by  the\n\nSupreme  Court, is  the  protection of  outside parties  from\n\n\"undu[e] discriminat[ion]\"  or  imposition of  an  \"excessive\n\nburden.\"  Sierra,  350 U.S. at 355.  If  there is some reason\n                \n\nfor departing from this public interest standard as framed by\n\nthe Supreme Court, the Commission has not supplied it.\n\n          We  assume, without  deciding, that:   (1)  FERC is\n\ncorrect  in its assertion that the State of New Hampshire did\n\nnot adequately represent the  interests of non-parties to the\n\ncontract,  and  that,  therefore,  the SPC  may  have  unduly\n\ndiscriminated  against those non-parties; and (2) the alleged\n\n                             -65-\n\nlack of arms'-length bargaining among NU,  PSNH and the State\n\nof  New Hampshire gave  the Commission the  right to evaluate\n\nthe SPC.  We hold, however,  that the Commission was bound to\n\nfollow  the Mobile-Sierra  doctrine as explicated  by Papago,\n                                                            \n\nand therefore should have evaluated  the SPC under the public\n\ninterest standard, not the just and reasonable standard.\n\n          We  therefore remand this issue for reconsideration\n                              \n\nby FERC under the public interest standard.24\n\nIV.

A group of public and private\n\nelectric  utilities,  state   commissions,  state   agencies,\n\nindependent  power producers,  cogenerators and  electric end\n\nusers26  claim  that FERC  erred when  it:   (1)  allowed the\n\nconsummation of  the merger upon  the filing of,  rather than\n\nupon   approval  of,   a  transmission   tariff;  (2) adopted\n\n                    \n\n25     Joint petitioners  and intervenors  include:   Central\nMaine  Power Company;  Boston Edison  Company; Bangor  Hydro-\nElectric  Company;   the  Towns  of   Concord,  Norwood   and\nWellesley, Massachusetts; Maine Public  Utilities Commission;\nMassachusetts   Department   of  Public   Utilities;  Vermont\nDepartment of Public  Service; Vermont Public Service  Board;\nRhode  Island Attorney  General;  Rhode  Island  Division  of\nPublic  Utilities  and   Carriers;  Massachusetts   Municipal\nWholesale  Electric  Company;  and,  City of  Holyoke  Gas  &amp;\nElectric Department.\n\n26   This  group of petitioners and intervenors  includes the\njoint petitioners and intervenors  listed in n.1, supra (with\n                                                       \nthe  exception of  Central Maine  Power Company),  and:   The\nAmerican  Paper  Institute,   Inc.;  American  Public   Power\nAssociation;  Canal  Electric Company;  Commonwealth Electric\nCompany;  Cambridge  Electric  Light  Company;  Massachusetts\nAttorney General; and, Montaup Electric Company.\n\n                             -6-\n\ntransmission   access  conditions  that  gave  \"native  load\"\n\ncustomers  a priority over  other customers; and (3) endorsed\n\n\"opportunity  cost\" pricing  principles.   The Holyoke  Gas &amp;\n\nElectric Department (\"Holyoke\")  argues that FERC  erred when\n\nit  failed  to:   (1) conduct  an  appropriate review  of the\n\nenvironmental impact  of the  proposed merger; and,  (2) make\n\nfindings    regarding    allegations    of    anticompetitive\n\nconsequences  of  the merger  that  were  unique to  Holyoke.\n\nFinally,  Northeast  Utilities   Service  Company   (\"NUSCO\")\n\nasserts that FERC's orders  changing the terms of  three rate\n\nschedules  filed in  conjunction with its  merger application\n\nwere arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.\n\n          For   the   reasons   which   follow,   we   reject\n\npetitioners' arguments and affirm the  Commission's decisions\n\nwith the exception of the Commission's decision to change the\n\nterms  of the  Seabrook Power  Contract which  we  remand for\n\nconsideration under the \"public interest\" standard.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND.\n\n     A.   Parties to the Approved Merger.\n\n          Northeast  Utilities (\"NU\") is a registered holding\n\ncompany under the Public Utility Holding Company  Act of 1935\n\n(PUHCA).  15 U.S.C.   79 et seq. (1988).  Northeast Utilities\n                                \n\nService Company (\"NUSCO\") is  a service company subsidiary of\n\n                             -7-\n\nNU   and  supplies  centralized  administrative  and  support\n\nservices to NU's operating companies.27\n\n          Prior to the merger,  Public Service Company of New\n\nHampshire (\"PSNH\")  was the  largest electric utility  in New\n\nHampshire, supplying  electric service to some 375,000 retail\n\ncustomers,  approximately  three-quarters   of  the   State's\n\npopulation, in every county in the State.  PSNH also provided\n\nwholesale service to the New  Hampshire Electric Cooperative,\n\nthree  New Hampshire  municipalities, and  one investor-owned\n\nutility,  Vermont  Electric  Power  Company.   PSNH  had  the\n\nlargest  ownership  share,  approximately  35.6  percent,  of\n\nSeabrook Unit  No. 1, a nuclear  generating facility declared\n\nto be available for service on June 30, 1990.\n\n     B.   The Merger Proposal.\n\n          On  January  28,  1988,  PSNH   filed  a  voluntary\n\npetition  in  the  United  States Bankruptcy  Court  for  the\n\nDistrict of New Hampshire for reorganization under Chapter 11\n\nof  the Bankruptcy Code.   11 U.S.C.    1101 et  seq. (1988).\n                                                     \n\nPSNH  alleged that it was unable to  recover in its rates the\n\noutlays  it had made in the construction and operation of the\n\nSeabrook  nuclear power  plant.   On  April  20, 1990,  after\n\n                    \n\n27   NU's operating companies are Connecticut Light and Power\nCompany  (CL&amp;P),  Western  Massachusetts   Electric  Company,\nHolyoke  Water  Power  Company (HWP)  and  HWP's wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, Holyoke Power and Electric Company (HP&amp;E).  These\ncompanies are wholly-owned subsidiaries  of NU and are public\nutilities supplying retail and wholesale electric service  in\nConnecticut and Massachusetts.\n\n                             -8-\n\nsifting through several  competing reorganization plans,  the\n\nbankruptcy court  approved NU's  proposal to merge  with PSNH\n\nand to  acquire and operate  all of PSNH's  power facilities.\n\nSee In re Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583333\"><a href=\"/opinion/583333/bankr-l-rep-p-74609-in-re-public-service-company-of-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                             \n\n470 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, Rochman v.

After  the merger, PSNH would be a\n\nwholly-owned  subsidiary   of  NU  and  would   transfer  its\n\nownership  interest   in  Seabrook  to  a   newly  formed  NU\n\nsubsidiary,   North   Atlantic  Energy   Corporation  (\"North\n\nAtlantic\").    The second  step  would occur  only  after all\n\nnecessary  approvals   were   received  from   the   relevant\n\nregulatory agencies.\n\n     C.   Procedural History.\n\n          On January 8, 1990, NUSCO, on behalf of NU and NU's\n\noperating subsidiaries, filed an  application with FERC under\n\nsection 203 of  the Federal  Power Act (\"FPA\"),  16 U.S.C.   \n\n824b (1988), seeking authorization for PSNH to dispose of all\n\nof its  jurisdictional facilities and  concurrently to  merge\n\nwith, and become  a subsidiary  of, NU.   In connection  with\n\n                             -9-\n\nthis application,  NUSCO filed four rate  schedules with FERC\n\npursuant  to     205   of  the  FPA:    the   Seabrook  Power\n\nContract,28   the  Sharing   Agreement29  and   two  Capacity\n\nInterchange Agreements.30\n\n          The  Commission  consolidated consideration  of the\n\nmerger  application and  rate  schedules,  accepted the  rate\n\nschedules for  filing and suspended their  effectiveness, and\n\nset for  hearings before an administrative  law judge (\"ALJ\")\n\nthe questions  of whether the  Commission should grant  the  \n\n203  application  and  approve   the  rate  schedules.

In its order, the Commission directed the parties to\n\n                    \n\n28  The Seabrook  Power Contract is a  life-of-the-unit power\nsales agreement between PSNH  and North Atlantic entered into\nconcurrently with  NU's acquisition of PSNH  and the transfer\nof PSNH's share  of Seabrook  to North Atlantic.   Under  the\ncontract, PSNH  agreed  to purchase  North Atlantic's  entire\nshare of Seabrook capacity and  energy, according to a  cost-\nof-service formula rate.  The contract was intended to ensure\nthat  North Atlantic would recover all of its costs from PSNH\nregardless of whether or not Seabrook actually operated.\n\n29   The Sharing Agreement allocates the benefits and obliga-\ntions from the  integrated operation of PSNH and  the current\nNU  system, as well as  the joint planning  and operations of\nthese  systems.   This  agreement established  a formula  for\nsharing the  expected post-merger benefits that  would accrue\nto NU and PSNH  operating companies as a result  of operating\nefficiencies  and  the  ability  to take  single  participant\nstatus under the NEPOOL agreement.\n\n30    The two Capacity Interchange Agreements provide for the\nsale  and purchase  of  energy between  PSNH and  Connecticut\nLight &amp; Power Company (CL&amp;P) over a ten-year term.\n\n                             -10-\n\naddress  the  effect of  the proposed  merger on  NU's market\n\npower and \"whether any transmission conditions  are necessary\n\nto eliminate any  adverse effect of the  proposed merger and,\n\nif  so,  what specific  conditions  should be  imposed.\"   50\n\nF.E.R.C. at 61,834-35.\n\n          On December  20, 1990,  the ALJ issued  its Initial\n\nDecision  approving  the     203  application  and  the  rate\n\nschedules   with   certain   modifications  and   conditions.\n\nNortheast Utilities Service Co., 53 F.E.R.C.   63,020 (1990).\n                               \n\nThe Commission, in Opinion No. 364, issued on August 9, 1991,\n\naffirmed in  part and  reversed in part  the ALJ's  decision,\n\nconditionally approving  the    203 application and  the rate\n\nschedules.

Background.\n                         \n\n          In reaching  his  decision to  approve the  NU-PSNH\n\nmerger,  the   ALJ  found  that  the   merger  would  produce\n\nsignificant benefits.  Specifically, he found that:  (1) PSNH\n\nwould emerge from bankruptcy  as a viable utility on  a solid\n\nfinancial  footing,  53  F.E.R.C.  at  65,211;  (2)  improved\n\nmanagement techniques and economies of scale would reduce the\n\noperating costs  of Seabrook by  some $527 million,31  id. at\n                                                          \n\n65,212; (3) application of NU operating procedures  to PSNH's\n\nfossil steam plants would save  $100 million, id. at  65,213;\n                                                 \n\n(4) reductions in  administrative and general  expenses would\n\nsave  $124  million, id.;  (5) NU's  record of  buying lower-\n                        \n\npriced coal on the  spot market would save $39  million, id.;\n                                                            \n\nand (6) the merger would yield $360 million in savings for NU\n\nbecause of  its ability to elect  \"single participant status\"\n\n                    \n\n31    This,  and all  other  dollar amounts  are net  present\nvalues unless otherwise noted.\n\n                             -13-\n\nin  the  New  England  Power  Pool  (NEPOOL),  a  power  pool\n\ncomprised of most of the utilities in New England.

Under the  authority of   203(b)  of the FPA, 16\n\nU.S.C.    824b(b), the  ALJ  approved the  merger subject  to\n\nseveral conditions, including the  following:  (1) the merged\n\ncompany  must  offer  firm  (non-interruptible)  transmission\n\nservice  for a minimum of 30 days  and a maximum of 20 years,\n\n53  F.E.R.C.  at  65,220-21;  (2) non-firm  service  must  be\n\noffered  for a one-day minimum  term, id. at  65,220; (3) the\n                                         \n\nmerger would be consummated concurrently with the filing of a\n\ncompliance tariff which fully reflects  all of the terms  and\n\nconditions set  out in  the ALJ's  Initial  Decision, id.  at\n                                                         \n\n65,221;  (4) NU  must  implement its  New Hampshire  Corridor\n\nProposal,32 thereby  making available 400 MW  of transmission\n\n                    \n\n32   The New Hampshire  Corridor Transmission Proposal allows\nNew  England  utilities  to purchase  long-term  transmission\nrights from NU-PSNH in order to connect with power sources in\nnorthern New England and Canada.

Discussion.\n                         \n\n          Petitioners make two claims  with regard to  FERC's\n\nevaluation  of the costs and benefits  of the NU-PSNH merger.\n\nFirst,  they  argue  that  the  Commission  should  not  have\n\nincluded resolution of PSNH's bankruptcy as a  benefit of the\n\nmerger because:  (1) PSNH actually emerged from bankruptcy on\n\nMay 16, 1991, the  effective date of the  Reorganization Plan\n\n(\"RP\");  and  (2) prior  to  gaining  the bankruptcy  court's\n\napproval  of the two-step RP, PSNH  had to show that it would\n\nbe  financially  viable  as   a  stand-alone  entity  because\n\nregulatory approval  for the  second step  of the  RP (merger\n\nwith and into NU) was not assured.  These two facts, however,\n\ndo not  imply that  it was  error for  FERC  to consider  the\n\n\"resolution of PSNH's bankruptcy\" as  a benefit, indeed as  a\n\nprincipal benefit, of the merger.  \n\n          It  is  true  that  PSNH, as  a  technical  matter,\n\n\"emerged\" from  bankruptcy prior  to FERC's  consideration of\n\nthe proposed merger.  The ALJ and the Commission did not hold\n\notherwise.   The  ALJ  stated, and  the Commission  summarily\n\naffirmed the fact that \"[t]he merger is part of  a plan which\n                                                       \n\nenables a  reorganized PSNH to  emerge from bankruptcy.\"   53\n\nF.E.R.C. at 65,211  (emphasis added); see also 56 F.E.R.C. at\n                                              \n\n                             -18-\n\n61,993.  Like the state regulators  who approved the two-step\n\nmerger  plan, the Commission  evaluated the plan  as a whole,\n\nanticipating  \"the merger   not  `stand alone' PSNH    as the\n\nultimate destiny  for the reorganized company.\"   53 F.E.R.C.\n\nat 65,211.   \"All parties to  the reorganization contemplated\n\n[stand  alone]  status as  an interim  step  en route  to the\n\nmerger.\"  Id.   It was the entire  plan, which admittedly had\n             \n\ntwo  sequential and  severable  steps, that  allowed PSNH  to\n\nemerge  from bankruptcy.  There is no evidence that the state\n\nregulators would have approved a plan to allow PSNH to emerge\n\nfrom bankruptcy  that included  only the first  \"stand alone\"\n\nstep.  Indeed, there is evidence to the contrary.\n\n          FERC  also found that \"resolving\" PSNH's bankruptcy\n\nmeant  more  than  simply  the emergence  of  PSNH  from  the\n\nprotection of  bankruptcy court.   FERC held  that the  final\n\nresolution of PSNH's bankruptcy included the treatment of its\n\ncreditors and  stockholders who stood  to lose  approximately\n\n$250 million  in  the absence  of  the merger.    As the  ALJ\n\nobserved, the Commission \"regard[s] the right of these public\n\nbondholders as of primary importance after the consumers have\n\nbeen protected.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,211 (quoting In re Evans,\n                                                            \n\n1 F.P.C. 511, 517  (1937) (approving an acquisition involving\n\nthe reorganization  of a bankrupt utility)).   The Commission\n\nalso held that it was  in the public interest to  approve the\n\ncreation  of a  stronger, more  viable merged  entity, rather\n\n                             -19-\n\nthan leaving PSNH in a \"weakened\", \"stand alone\" state.  This\n\nholding was sufficiently supported by evidence in the record.\n\n          Petitioners also  claim that, given  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's   \"feasibility   finding\"  required   by   11  U.S.C.\n\n  1129(a)(11),36  the Commission  was estopped  from reaching\n\nthe  conclusion that a \"stand  alone\" PSNH would  be \"weak.\" \n\nWe disagree.   The  bankruptcy court  and FERC evaluated  the\n\nmerger proposal under  different standards.   The  bankruptcy\n\ncourt  was required  to determine  the likelihood  of further\n\nliquidation or reorganization proceedings were the plan to be\n\napproved.  FERC was obliged to determine whether the plan was\n\n\"consistent  with   the  public   interest.\"    It   was  not\n\ninconsistent for FERC to find that although PSNH was  capable\n\nof  surviving  as  a stand  alone  entity,  it  would not  be\n\n\"consistent  with the  public interest\"  to prevent  a merger\n\nthat  would  result   in  an  even  stronger  utility.    The\n\nprinciples of estoppel simply do not apply  in a case such as\n\nthis, where the issues litigated and the standards applied in\n\nthe two proceedings are so different. \n\n                    \n\n36   The Bankruptcy Code provides that:\n     (a)   The   court   shall  confirm   a   plan   [of\n     reorganization]  only  if   all  of  the  following\n     requirements are met:\n     (11) confirmation  of the plan is not  likely to be\n     followed  by  the  liquidation,  or  the  need  for\n     further financial reorganization, of the  debtor or\n     any successor to the  debtor under the plan, unless\n     such liquidation  or reorganization is  proposed in\n     the plan.\n  11 U.S.C.   1129(a)(11).\n\n                             -20-\n\n          Even were petitioners correct in their asseveration\n\nthat  FERC  improperly  counted  the  resolution   of  PSNH's\n\nbankruptcy  as a  benefit  of the  merger, \"the  Commission's\n\nerror would be immaterial in light of the overwhelming excess\n\nof other  benefits ($791  million) over  the costs  (0) still\n\nattributable . . . to the acquisition.\"   City of Holyoke Gas\n                                                             \n\n&amp; Elec.

At issue in this case is whether FERC is required by\n\nstatute,  or otherwise,  to  engage  in \"standard\"  antitrust\n\nanalysis before  passing on    203  merger applications.   In\n\nclaiming that  FERC has such an  obligation, petitioners rely\n\non a statute  governing agency approval of  bank mergers (the\n\n                             -21-\n\n\"Bank  Merger  Act\")  which   states  that  the  agency  with\n\njurisdiction over a proposed bank merger,37\n\n          shall not approve  \n             (A)  any  proposed merger  transaction\n          which  would result  in  a  monopoly,  or\n          which  would  be  in furtherance  of  any\n          combination  or conspiracy  to monopolize\n          or  to attempt to monopolize the business\n          of  banking in  any  part  of the  United\n          States, or\n             (B)   any    other   proposed   merger\n          transaction whose effect  in any  section\n          of  the country  may be  substantially to\n          lessen  competition, or to tend to create\n          a monopoly, or which in any  other manner\n          would be in restraint of trade, unless it\n          finds that the anticompetitive effects of\n          the  proposed   transaction  are  clearly\n          outweighed in the public interest  by the\n          probable  effects  of the  transaction in\n          meeting the convenience  and needs of the\n          community to be served. . . .\n          (6)   The    responsible   agency   shall\n          immediately  notify the  Attorney General\n          of any  approval by  it pursuant  to this\n          subsection    of   a    proposed   merger\n          transaction.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1828(c)(5)-(6).

We disagree.\n\n          As with  any matter  of statutory construction,  we\n\nfirst examine the language  of the statute.  Under  16 U.S.C.\n\n  824b(a),  the  Commission  is required,  after  notice  and\n\nopportunity  for hearing,  to  approve a  proposed merger  of\n\nutility  facilities if  it finds  that the proposal  \"will be\n\nconsistent  with  the  public interest.\"    That  is all  the\n\nstatute  says.  There  is no explicit  reference to antitrust\n\npolicies or principles.   There is no  evidence that Congress\n\nsought  to  have  the  Commission  serve  as  an  enforcer of\n\nantitrust  policy  in  conjunction  with  the  Department  of\n\nJustice and  the Federal Trade  Commission.  The  Bank Merger\n\nAct  reveals a  quite different  intention.   There, Congress\n\nexplicitly  set out  standards for  approval of  bank mergers\n\nthat incorporate  principles  embodied  in  the  Sherman  and\n\nClayton  Acts.   12  U.S.C.   1828(c)(5).   By  requiring the\n\nreviewing  agency  to  notify  the Attorney  General  of  any\n\ndecision  to approve  a  proposed bank  merger,  12 U.S.C.   \n\n1828(c)(6),  Congress  expressed  its  desire  to  have  bank\n\nregulators  serve as pre-screening  bodies of  mergers which,\n\nbecause of their importance or character, in most  cases also\n\ndeserve the attention of the Department of Justice.\n\n                             -23-\n\n          The Bank  Merger Act  carries with it  the implicit\n\npresumption that  mergers are  to be disapproved  (the agency\n\n\"shall not approve\" a  bank merger \"unless it finds  that the\n\nanticompetitive  effects are clearly outweighed in the public\n\ninterest\"  by   the  benefits   of  the  merger,   12  U.S.C.\n\n  1828(c)(5)).   The  FPA,  on the  other hand,  requires the\n\nCommission to approve any merger that is \"consistent with the\n\npublic  interest.\"     16   U.S.C.     824b(a).     Antitrust\n\nconsiderations   are,   of   course,   relevant   in   FERC's\n\nconsideration of  the \"public interest\"  in merger proposals.\n\nThe  statute,  however,  does  not require  FERC  to  analyze\n\nproposed mergers under the same standards that the Department\n\nof Justice or bank regulators must apply.\n\n          Although  the  Commission  must  include  antitrust\n\nconsiderations in its public interest calculus under the FPA,\n\nit is not  bound to use antitrust principles when they may be\n\ninconsistent  with the  Commission's  regulatory goals.   See\n                                                             \n\nOtter  Tail,   410  U.S.   at   373  (\"[a]lthough   antitrust\n           \n\nconsiderations  may be  relevant [in  determining  the public\n\ninterest], they are not determinative\").

Cir.  1978).\n               \n\nSection  202(a)  of the  Federal  Power  Act encourages  such\n\nvoluntary  interconnection  and  coordination of  electricity\n\ngenerating facilities in order to achieve economies of scale.\n\n16  U.S.C.    824a; see  also 16  U.S.C.    824a-1 (regarding\n                             \n\npooling  agreements).  The Agreement  was approved as a filed\n\nrate  schedule  by  FERC's  predecessor,  the  Federal  Power\n\nCommission.   53 F.E.R.C. at  65,213.  Under  its terms, each\n\nmember  is  required  to   supply  the  pool  with  resources\n\n(\"Capacity Responsibility\") according to a formula based upon\n\nthe  relationship of the member's peak load to an estimate of\n\naggregate peak load of all members.\n\n          NU  experiences its  peak load  in the  summer, and\n\nPSNH experiences its peak load in the winter.  By aggregating\n\nthese two,  complementary, peak loads, NU-PSNH  can achieve a\n\nlower Capacity Responsibility than would  be the case if  the\n\ntwo   utilities  remained  separate.    Because  the  overall\n\ncapacity requirements of NEPOOL  will not change as  a result\n\nof the merger, the Capacity Responsibilities of other members\n\nmust rise to  make up  for the savings  accruing to  NU-PSNH.\n\nThe  ALJ  accepted  the  \"undisputed\" estimate  that  \"single\n\nparticipant status\" (SPS)  will result in a  shifting of some\n\n$360  million in costs from  NU-PSNH to other  members of the\n\npool.  Id.\n          \n\n                             -26-\n\n                             -27-\n\n          2.   Discussion.\n                         \n\n          Petitioners  offer six  arguments to  support their\n\nclaim that FERC erred  in failing to condition the  merger on\n\nwaiver of SPS by NU and PSNH.  First, petitioners  claim that\n\nthe Commission  did not  properly interpret the  provision of\n\nthe NEPOOL Agreement which  governs the election of SPS.   We\n\nagree with  the Commission's finding that  the Agreement both\n\nspecifically allows for the election  by NU-PSNH of SPS,  and\n\nencourages  such elections.    Section 3.1  of the  Agreement\n\nprovides in relevant part that:\n\n          All  Entities which  are controlled  by a\n          single person (such as a corporation or a\n          common law business  trust) which owns at\n          least seventy-five percent of  the voting\n          shares   of   each  of   them   shall  be\n                                               \n          collectively   treated    as   a   single\n          Participant   for    purposes   of   this\n          Agreement, if they elect  such treatment.\n          They are  encouraged to  do so.   Such an\n                                        \n          election shall  be  made by  signing  the\n          appropriate   form  at   the  end   of  a\n          counterpart of this Agreement.\n\n(Emphasis  supplied.)    Both  the  ALJ  and  the  Commission\n\ninterpreted section 3.1 to be  an explicit endorsement of the\n\nelection of  SPS by NU-PSNH.   The  ALJ stated that  \"[i]t is\n\nundisputed  that  NU  and   PSNH  qualify  for  such  [single\n\nparticipant]  status under  the Agreement.\"   53  F.E.R.C. at\n\n65,213.  The Commission  gave great weight to the  unrebutted\n\ntestimony  of  witness  Bigelow,   who  participated  in  the\n\nnegotiation of  the NEPOOL Agreement regarding  the intent of\n\nthe  original  signatories   to  the   Agreement  and   their\n\n                             -28-\n\nrecognition  of  such  potentially  large  cost-shifts  among\n\nNEPOOL members.  Bigelow stated:\n\n          [W]hen  we put  NEPOOL together  20 years\n          ago,  we  recognized  that  these  things\n          might happen.  This is not something that\n          snuck  up  on people. . . .   And  we did\n          discuss  at  length  what   would  happen\n          because . . . we were then coming up to a\n          potential   merger   of  Boston   Edison,\n          Eastern Utilities, New England Power.  It\n          was recognized that these kinds of things\n          could happen in the future and we spelled\n          out the ground rules and  recognized that\n          that would  happen when it happened.  And\n          the  people   who  didn't  like   it  got\n          something else for it.\n\n53  F.E.R.C.  at 65,214.   Both  the  ALJ and  the Commission\n\nrejected petitioners' claim on the basis of both the language\n\nof the Agreement, and Bigelow's unrebutted testimony that not\n\nonly  had the  signatories been  aware of such  a potentially\n\nlarge  savings  shift, but  that  those  utilities that  were\n\ndissatisfied  with this risk  received additional concessions\n\nas  compensation.    We  will not  disturb  the  Commission's\n\nfindings.\n\n          Second,  petitioners claim  that the  Agreement, as\n\ninterpreted in  NEPOOL Power Pool Agreement,  56 F.P.C. 1562,\n                                           \n\n1580 (1976), aff'd sub nom. Municipalities of Groton v. FERC,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"361172\"><a href=\"/opinion/361172/municipalities-of-groton-v-federal-energy-regulatory-commission-nepool/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1978), prohibits utilities with peak\n\nloads  in different  seasons  from  electing  SPS.    As  the\n\nCommission  explained,  this  argument  mischaracterizes  the\n\nAgreement and  the decision  of the Federal  Power Commission\n\n(\"FPC\") in NEPOOL.\n                 \n\n                             -29-\n\n          The NEPOOL Agreement, as  initially filed\n          and    as   approved,    allowed   single\n          participant    status    for    utilities\n          controlled by a single \"person\" owning at\n          least 75 percent of the voting shares  of\n          each utility.  An exception was expressly\n          allowed  in the  filed agreement  for any\n          Vermont  utility  which  elected   to  be\n          grouped   with  Vermont   Electric  Power\n          Company.  This exception was approved for\n          essentially two reasons:  (1) the Vermont\n          utilities  had  long  acted  as  a single\n          contiguous  integrated  electric  entity;\n          and (2) since  they all experienced their\n          peak loads in winter,  single participant\n          status would not give them a lower NEPOOL\n          Capability Responsibility (and consequent\n          savings).    A   broader  exception   was\n          denied, however, for a group of municipal\n          utilities (represented by MMWEC) that was\n          not entitled to single participant status\n          and  that lacked the two cited attributes\n          of the  Vermont utilities.  The basis for\n          the denial was that allowing  such status\n          for \"any group of systems, such as MMWEC,\n          could   well   be   detrimental  to   the\n          functioning of NEPOOL.\"\n             The  NEPOOL  decision, thus,  does not\n          stand  for  the  proposition that  single\n          participant status is  available only  to\n          utilities  having their peak loads in the\n          same  season.    Instead,   another  way,\n          indeed   the   primary   way,  in   which\n          utilities  may qualify  is  if  they  are\n          controlled  by  a  single person  with  a\n          least 75-percent common ownership.   That\n          is the basis upon  which NU and PSNH will\n          presumably seek to  qualify if the merger\n          is  approved.   Such status  is expressly\n          allowed   under   the  NEPOOL   Agreement\n          regardless of when NU and PSNH experience\n          their peak loads.\n\n56 F.E.R.C. at 61,996-97.  The reasons  offered by the FPC in\n\nits  decision  to  grant  a  special  exception  for  Vermont\n\nutilities seeking SPS were  not intended to be, and  are not,\n\nconditions, in  addition to those  set out in  the Agreement,\n\n                             -30-\n\nwhich must be satisfied to elect SPS.  The FPC did not narrow\n\nthe scope of Section  3.1 to apply only to  utilities sharing\n\nthe  same peak  load  season; rather,  it  created a  special\n\nexception to the  75 percent rule  to accommodate the  unique\n\nsituation faced by Vermont utilities.\n\n          Third, petitioners  claim that FERC failed  to give\n\nproper consideration  to Section  4.2 of the  Agreement, \"the\n\ninterests of  other  pool members,  and  the purpose  of  the\n\nAgreement as  a whole.\"  Essentially,  petitioners argue that\n\nallowing  NU-PSNH  to  elect  SPS  would  violate  a  general\n\nprovision  of the  Agreement, which states  that participants\n\n\"shall  not . . . take  advantage of  the provisions  of this\n\nAgreement so  as to harm another Participant  or to prejudice\n\nthe  position  of any  Participant  in  the electric  utility\n\nbusiness.\"   We  reject  this argument  for the  same reasons\n\nexpressed   by  the  Commission   in  its   decision  denying\n\npetitioners' request for a rehearing:\n\n          [W]e  find more  relevance in  the NEPOOL\n          Agreement's   explicit   endorsement   of\n          single  participant  status  than in  the\n          agreement's  general  goal of  \"equitable\n          sharing\"   and  prohibition   on  members\n          \"taking  advantage\"  of the  agreement to\n          harm  or prejudice  other  members.   The\n          NEPOOL Agreement  specifically encourages\n          eligible    parties   to    seek   single\n          participant status;  the provisions cited\n          by  the  intervenors  are   general,  not\n          specific.      Construing   the   general\n          consistent  with  the  specific, we  find\n          single participant status for  the merged\n          company  consistent   with  an  equitable\n          sharing,  as  envisioned  by  the  NEPOOL\n\n                             -31-\n\n          Agreement, and not  violative of the  ban\n          on  taking  advantage of  the agreement's\n          provisions  to  harm  or prejudice  other\n          members.\n\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,189.   We agree with FERC's  interpretation\n\nof  the  Agreement.     The  NEPOOL  signatories   explicitly\n\nencouraged  qualified  members  to  seek  SPS,   indeed  they\n\ncontemplated that members that merged might choose to do just\n\nthat.   We agree  with the  Commission's construction  of the\n\nAgreement which avoids a direct conflict between Sections 3.1\n\nand 4.2, and instead gives both provisions reasonable effect.\n\n          Fourth, petitioners argue that failure to condition\n\nthe   merger  on   waiver  of   SPS  would   create  \"serious\n\ndisincentives\"   for  current   members  to   continue  their\n\nmembership  in NEPOOL,  and  that the  breakup  of NEPOOL  is\n\ncontrary to the public interest.  Petitioners imply that FERC\n\ndid not take seriously their complaints about SPS, but rather\n\nrested its decision  not to  require a waiver  solely on  the\n\nfact that the Agreement allowed the election of SPS.  This is\n\nsimply not so.\n\n          The  Commission reversed  the ALJ  on the  issue of\n\nwhether SPS savings  should be  counted as a  benefit of  the\n\nmerger.   The Commission  found that  because the  cost shift\n\namounted  to  a  zero-sum   transaction,  with  NU  and  PSNH\n\nbenefitting and the other members burdened dollar-for-dollar,\n\nthe shift could not  be counted as a  benefit of the  merger.\n\n                             -32-\n\n56  F.E.R.C. at 61,997.  Thus, the Commission did not dismiss\n\npetitioners' claims regarding SPS without thought.\n\n          Also,  the ALJ  found,  and the  Commission agreed,\n\nthat SPS was essential to the merger, and that the merger, as\n\nconditioned, was in the public interest.  FERC must approve a\n\nproposed merger if it is consistent with the public interest.\n\n16  U.S.C.    824b(a).    FERC  has  the  discretion  to  add\n\nconditions  to a proposed  merger to  ensure that  the merger\n\nwill, taken as a whole, be in the public interest.  16 U.S.C.\n\n   824b(b).    FERC  need  not, however,  explain  why  every\n\ncondition, or failure to  establish a condition is consistent\n\nwith the public interest when considered separately and apart\n\nfrom the entire transaction.  Petitioners seem to argue  that\n\nFERC was required by law to  state why it was consistent with\n\nthe  public interest  to  follow the  explicit  terms of  the\n\napproved fifteen  year-old  NEPOOL Agreement  rather than  to\n\ncondition  the  merger  on   waiver  of  a  membership  right\n\nestablished by the Agreement.   FERC had no such  obligation.\n\nIt need not have  explained why it failed to add a particular\n\ncondition  prior to approving  a merger.   The statute simply\n\nprovides that \"[t]he Commission may grant any application for\n\nan order under this section in whole or in part and upon such\n\nterms and conditions as it  finds necessary or appropriate to\n\nsecure the  maintenance of adequate  service and coordination\n\nin  the   public  interest  of  facilities   subject  to  the\n\n                             -33-\n\njurisdiction  of the Commission.\"   16 U.S.C.    824b(b).  In\n\nthis  case, the Commission  set forth a  reasonable basis for\n\napproving the  merger as consistent with  the public interest\n\nin light of the supplementary conditions the Commission found\n\nnecessary.   FERC  need not  have gone  further than  this to\n\nexplain  why it  failed  to place  further conditions  on the\n\nmerger.\n\n          Fifth,   petitioners   allege   that   FERC   acted\n\ninconsistently in  its  treatment of  the NEPOOL  Agreement's\n\nprovisions regarding  voting rights and SPS.   The Commission\n\nadopted  a  condition limiting  the  merged company's  NEPOOL\n\nvoting  rights to  prevent PSNH  and NU  from gaining  a veto\n\npower  in NEPOOL.  56  F.E.R.C. at 62,043-45.   FERC reasoned\n\nthat,  while   there  was   evidence  that   the  signatories\n\nanticipated  that  large   cost-shifts  would  accompany  the\n\nelection  of SPS in merger  situations, there was no evidence\n\nthat they anticipated the  voting rights implications of such\n\nmergers.   58 F.E.R.C.  at 61,189.   It was not,  contrary to\n\npetitioners' argument,  inconsistent as a matter  of logic to\n\ncondition voting rights where the Agreement was silent on the\n\nneed or lack of need to do so, while failing to condition SPS\n\nwhere the  Agreement explicitly favored the  election of SPS.\n\nFurthermore, it was not  an error of law to  condition voting\n\nrights while  leaving SPS  rights untouched.   Petitioners do\n\nnot  contest the Commission's decision to condition NU-PSNH's\n\n                             -34-\n\nvoting  rights.    We  will uphold  whatever  conditions  the\n\nCommission  imposes on  a proposed  merger  so long  as their\n\nnecessity is supported in the record by substantial evidence.\n\n          Finally,  petitioners  contend that  the Commission\n\n\"failed to  explain why  burdening other NEPOOL  members with\n\n$364 million in additional  costs with no offsetting benefits\n\nto them is consistent  with the public interest.\"   In making\n\nthis argument, petitioners imply that each and every piece of\n\na complex package of merger agreements and conditions must be\n\nable to  withstand \"public interest\"  analysis without regard\n\nto other pieces of the package or to other conditions imposed\n\nby  the  Commission.   Petitioners  also  imply that  if  any\n\nindividual or group is harmed by a piece of the package, that\n\nprovision is not in the public interest and must therefore be\n\nstricken  or modified.   Both  implicit arguments  are deeply\n\nflawed.\n\n          In  evaluating a  transaction  such as  the one  at\n\nissue  here, the  Commission  is required  to  find that  the\n\nentire transaction, taken as a whole,  is consistent with the\n\npublic interest.  16 U.S.C.    824b(a).  Each element of  the\n\ntransaction  need not  benefit  every  utility or  individual\n\nwhich might  be affected; rather, the  whole transaction must\n\nbe consistent with the interest of \"the public.\"  There is no\n\nreason  to  think  that  the interest  of  individual  NEPOOL\n\nmembers is  synonymous with  the \"public\"  interest.  As  has\n\n                             -35-\n\nalready been noted,  FERC may  add conditions  to a  proposed\n\nmerger before granting approval.   16 U.S.C.   824b(b).   The\n\nstatute  does  not  require,  however,  that  FERC  establish\n\nconditions so  that every effect of an  approved merger could\n\nwithstand the \"public interest\" test.\n\n          At  a less  theoretical level,  the ALJ  determined\n\nthat the NEPOOL savings  \"were a vital  part of the long  and\n\nstrenuous negotiations which culminated in the resulting PSNH\n\nreorganization plan,\"  and  the particular  savings  of  $146\n\nmillion   for  New   Hampshire   consumers  were   relied  on\n\nspecifically by the  State of New Hampshire in  approving the\n\nmerged company's rate package.   53 F.E.R.C. at 65,213.   The\n\nCommission accepted this  finding of the  ALJ, while, at  the\n\nsame time, it reversed  the ALJ's decision to count  the $360\n\nmillion as  a benefit of the merger.   58 F.E.R.C. at 61,997.\n\nThe fact that  the cost-shift was not a benefit to be counted\n\nin weighing the  benefits and  costs of the  merger does  not\n\nmean that  the election of SPS and the concomitant cost-shift\n\nis not in  the public interest.   Election of  SPS is in  the\n\npublic interest because it is a central element of the merger\n\nplan  which, viewed  as  a whole,  was  found by  FERC  to be\n\nconsistent  with  the public  interest  based  on substantial\n\nevidence in the record.  We approve the Commission's decision\n\nnot to condition the merger on waiver by NU of SPS.\n\n     C.   Timing of Merger's Consummation.\n\n                             -36-\n\n          In  the  proceedings before  the  ALJ,  NU proposed\n\nfiling  a transmission  tariff within  60 days  following the\n\nmerger.  Intervenors and Commission staff proposed the filing\n\nand  approval of  an  interim  transmission  rate.   The  ALJ\n\nrejected  both proposals  and  instead held  that the  merger\n\nwould  be  consummated upon  the  filing  of NU's  compliance\n                                        \n\ntariff.  He reasoned as follows:\n\n          I see no  need for  requiring one  tariff\n          (with potential for controversy, charges,\n          collections and refunds)  to be  followed\n          by  yet  another  tariff,  with  its  own\n          potential for still other disputes.\n             Avoiding  a  transitional period  will\n          make   it   unnecessary   to  require   a\n          transitional  tariff.    To achieve  this\n          result, consummation of  the merger  must\n          be conditioned on  the concurrent  filing\n          of  a  compliance   tariff  which   fully\n          reflects all of  the terms and conditions\n          set out in this Initial Decision.  Such a\n          condition should encourage  a prompt  and\n          fair compliance filing  because NU  could\n          not begin  to  reap the  merger  benefits\n          without it.\n\n53 F.E.R.C. at 65,221.  The Commission concurred:\n\n             We    believe    the   GTC    [General\n          Transmission   Conditions]  and   the  NH\n          Corridor  Proposal,  as modified  herein,\n          adequately    mitigate    the    merger's\n          anticompetitive effects without requiring\n          the adoption of the Merger Tariff.  Trial\n          Staff stated that the Merger Tariff would\n          make  service available  immediately upon\n          approval of the merger.   We believe that\n          the presiding judge accomplished the same\n          result  by  allowing consummation  of the\n          merger  when  NU  submits its  compliance\n          filing.\n             We further believe  that delaying  the\n          merger's    consummation    until     the\n          Commission   accepts    NU's   compliance\n\n                             -37-\n\n          submittal    for    filing    would    be\n          inappropriate   given   the   uncertainty\n          surrounding    issues   which    may   be\n          challenged   and   subject   to   further\n          litigation  in the  compliance proceeding\n          and  given our  commitment to  act before\n          the Merger Agreement's December  31, 1991\n          termination date.  We believe that NU and\n          PSNH are  entitled to  a prompt and  fair\n          resolution  of this  proceeding.   At the\n          same time the intervenors are entitled to\n          have service begin as soon  as practical,\n          together  with a  fair resolution  of any\n          disputes raised regarding NU's compliance\n          filing.  Accordingly, we believe  that it\n          is in the best  interests of all  parties\n          to allow NU to consummate the merger when\n          it submits  its  compliance filing.    We\n          shall also require  NU to begin  honoring\n          such  requests  for transmission  service\n          under the  GTC,  as modified  herein,  at\n          that  time.    Such transmission  service\n          will be  provided at  either the firm  or\n          non-firm  transmission rates  proposed in\n          NU's   compliance   filing,  subject   to\n          refund, and  without a refund  floor.  In\n          reviewing    NU's   filing    to   ensure\n          compliance  with  this  Opinion, we  will\n          hold  NU to a very high  standard.  As NU\n          itself  states, \"[i]f NU  fails to comply\n          with  the  letter   or  spirit  of   such\n          [Commission]  requirement,  NU  would  be\n          subject to summary judgment  with respect\n          to any aspect of its compliance filing.\"\n\n56 F.E.R.C. at 62,025.\n\n          Petitioners'  stated concern  is that,  by allowing\n\nthe  merger to be consummated prior to FERC's approval of the\n\ncompliance tariff, FERC did not provide a sufficient guaranty\n\nthat NU would provide transmission access that would mitigate\n\n                             -38-\n\nthe  merger's  anticompetitive  effects.38    Petitioners  do\n\nnot, however,  seek  to unravel  the  merger.   Rather,  they\n\npropose that any  cost shift under the  NEPOOL Agreement, see\n                                                             \n\ndiscussion in  Part III(B),  supra, be postponed  until after\n                                  \n\nthe compliance tariff is approved.  Petitioners complain that\n\nthe course chosen by FERC creates an incentive on the part of\n\nNU  to delay  proceedings on  the compliance  tariff, thereby\n\nmaximizing  competitive  advantage.   Petitioners do  not, of\n\ncourse,  point  out  that  their  proposal  would  create  an\n\nincentive  on  their  part to  delay  final  approval of  the\n\ncompliance tariff, thereby postponing the day when the NEPOOL\n\ncost shift will take effect.\n\n          The ALJ and the Commission carefully considered the\n\nalternatives before reaching their decisions.  The Commission\n\nheld that the anticompetitive effects of the merger  would be\n\nadequately  mitigated  by  the  dual  requirements   that  NU\n\nimmediately provide  transmission access upon  the filing  of\n\nits compliance  tariff, and  that any  fees  collected by  NU\n\nwould be subject to  refund without a refund floor.   Because\n\nNU  accepted  these  merger conditions,  the  Commission  can\n\nenforce NU's  promise to pay  such refunds if  the Commission\n\nfinds them to be appropriate.

We  hold that\n       \n\nFERC's exercise  of its  discretion was not  inappropriate in\n\nthese  circumstances.   FERC  did not  defer, as  petitioners\n\nsuggest,  consideration of the anticompetitive effects of the\n\nmerger  which  FERC  itself   identified.    The   Commission\n\nrecognized the effects, and dealt with them in a reasoned way\n\nwhich  balanced  the  competing  interests  of  all  parties.\n\nFERC's remedy  is not  unreasonable, and we  therefore affirm\n\nits order.\n\n     D.   Protection of Native Load Customers.\n\n          1.   Priority of Services.\n                                   \n\n                             -40-\n\n               a.   Background.\n                              \n\n          In its  merger  application, NU  made  a  voluntary\n\ncommitment   to   provide  wholesale   transmission  service,\n\nincluding third  party wheeling  service,39  for any  utility\n\nover  its existing transmission system.  At the same time, NU\n\nsought  to limit  this  obligation by  reserving an  absolute\n\npriority  for  power  purchases  on  behalf  of  native  load\n\ncustomers (whose  power  needs NU  is bound  by franchise  or\n\ncontract  to  meet).   The  ALJ  held  that  although NU  may\n\nreasonably give  native load service  priority over  wheeling\n\nservice if NU's transmission system had insufficient capacity\n\nto serve both, 53  F.E.R.C. at 65,221-222, NU could  not deny\n\nfirm  wheeling   requests  based  upon  the   reservation  of\n\ntransmission  capacity for  its  own non-firm  sales, id.  at\n                                                         \n\n65,225.  \n\n          In Opinion  No.  364, the  Commission balanced  the\n\ninterests of  native load customers and  third party wheeling\n\ncustomers  and  affirmed  the  ALJ's denial  of  an  absolute\n\npriority:\n\n          we  .  . .  deny  NU's  proposal to  give\n          higher priority to  its own non-firm  use\n          than  to third  party  requests for  firm\n          wheeling    in     allocating    existing\n          transmission  capacity.    In  no  event,\n          however, will  NU be required  to provide\n          firm third party wheeling service  out of\n          existing   transmission   facilities   if\n\n                    \n\n39   For a definition of \"wheeling\" see n.9, supra.\n                                                  \n\n                             -41-\n\n          reliability  of  service  to native  load\n          customers would be adversely affected.\n\n56  F.E.R.C. at  62,021 (footnote  omitted).   The Commission\n\nfound it \"reasonable to allow NU to reserve firm transmission\n\ncapacity  to  provide reliable  service  to  its native  load\n                              \n\ncustomers.\"  Id. (Emphasis in original.)\n                \n\n          On rehearing,  NU asked the  Commission to  clarify\n\nthe  scope of  the \"reliability\"  criterion.   The Commission\n\n\"reiterate[d] that under no circumstances will NU be required\n\nto provide firm wheeling service out of existing transmission\n\ncapacity where  doing so would impair  or degrade reliability\n\nof  service to native load customers.\"  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,199\n\n(emphasis  removed).   The  Commission  held  the concept  of\n\nreliability generally  encompasses the:   (1) reservation  of\n\ntransmission capacity to back  up large generating units; (2)\n\nprovision of generation reserves; and (3) coverage of certain\n\nfuture  needs.     As  to  the  coverage   of  future  demand\n\nrequirements, the Commission  specifically ordered that  \"any\n\ncapacity needed for reliability purposes  within a reasonable\n\nplanning horizon  must be offered  for wheeling use  until NU\n\nexpects  to need the capacity  for reliability reasons.\"  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 61,199-200.\n\n          Petitioners assert  that the  decision to accord  a\n\npriority to native load  over transmission load is arbitrary,\n\ndiscriminatory, and  anticompetitive.   They argue  that FERC\n\nneither  defined  nor  justified  the   priority  granted  by\n\n                             -42-\n\nallowing reservation of transmission capacity for native load\n\nservice  and  that  any  such  priority  creates  competitive\n\nadvantages for  NU.  We  hold that the  Commission adequately\n\ndefined and reasonably justified its decision to allow such a\n\nreservation  and  properly   addressed  the   anticompetitive\n\nconcerns raised by the intervenors.  \n\n               b.   Discussion.\n                              \n\n          Although the Commission reaffirmed the general rule\n\nthat  firm transmission service  should be  accorded priority\n\nover  non-firm  service, even  if  the  latter would  benefit\n\nnative load,    it nonetheless  allowed  NU to  reserve  firm\n\ntransmission capacity  needed to ensure reliability of native\n\nload  service and allowed the  use of this  capacity for non-\n\nfirm transactions.  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,196.  Thus, native load\n\nservice will receive  a \"priority\" over third-party  wheeling\n\nservice  in  allocating existing  transmission  capacity when\n\nreliability  of service  to  native load  would be  adversely\n\naffected.     The  Commission  specifically   qualified  this\n\npriority by requiring NU  to offer the capacity  for wheeling\n\nuse until NU needed  it to assure reliability to  native load\n\ncustomers.\n\n          There  is nothing arbitrary or discriminatory about\n\nFERC's decision.  It struck  a reasonable balance between the\n\ncompeting interests of native load customers and  third-party\n\nwheeling customers.  NU-PSNH is obligated to serve its native\n\n                             -43-\n\nload  customers.  In return for this obligation to serve, the\n\nnative load customers regularly bear the cost of transmission\n\nfacilities;  native load  customers pay  for them,  use them,\n\nplan  on them, and rely on them.   As the ALJ noted, \"[e]very\n\nNew England utility favors  its own native load.   Nothing in\n\nthe NEPOOL agreement requires  its members to surrender their\n\nnative load preference, and none do.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,222.\n\nThus,  \"NU should be allowed  to give priority  over safe and\n\nreliable service to its  native load customers using existing\n\ntransmission capacity  built to  serve those customers.\"   58\n\nF.E.R.C. at  61,199.   FERC explicitly defined  and justified\n\nthe challenged native load \"priority.\"\n\n          2.   Transmission Upgrades Pricing.\n                                             \n\n               a.   Background.\n                              \n\n          NU's commitment to provide third-party transmission\n\nservice   includes   the  obligation   to   build  additional\n\ntransmission facilities as necessary to  relieve transmission\n\nconstraints on  its system.   58  F.E.R.C.  at 61,204-10;  56\n\nF.E.R.C. at 62,021-24.   The issue  then becomes, how  should\n\nthe  cost  of  constructing  such  transmission  upgrades  be\n\nallocated.  The ALJ stated  that questions of cost allocation\n\nare  best  addressed  in  future  proceedings  regarding  the\n\nparticular   responsibilities   for  particular   facilities.\n\nNevertheless,  the ALJ  adopted  the \"but  for\" analysis  for\n\ndetermining responsibility proposed by NU witness Schultheis:\n\n                             -44-\n\n          [W]heeling customers must make a pro rata\n          contribution   whenever  the   facilities\n          would  not have been  needed but  for the\n          wheeling  transfers across  a constrained\n          interface.   This means that  NU's native\n          load customers pay for the new facilities\n          they  create  the need  for  and wheeling\n          customers  pay  for  the facilities  they\n          create the need for.\n\n53 F.E.R.C. at 65,223.  The ALJ also noted that the financial\n\nexposure of  transmission customers  was limited by  the cost\n\ncaps  to  which NU  was committed.40    Id. at  65,224.   The\n                                           \n\nCommission agreed that cost  questions should be litigated in\n\nthe context of a specific proposal,  and accepted the concept\n\nof  the \"but for\" test  as a framework  for ascertaining cost\n\nresponsibility and the  use of  the proposed cost  caps as  a\n\nreasonable  means of  limiting  the  transmission  customers'\n\nresponsibility for  future upgrades.  56  F.E.R.C. at 62,028-\n\n030.   The Commission reaffirmed that  decision on rehearing.\n\n58 F.E.R.C. 61,204-207.\n\n          Petitioners  contend that the  Commission failed to\n\nadequately  explain  the pricing  policy  it  will employ  in\n\npricing  transmission upgrades.  Basically, petitioners claim\n\nthe ruling is too ambiguous to determine whether, or how, the\n\n                    \n\n40  NU committed  to cap  cost responsibility  to \"(1)  those\nspecific facilities  identified  by NU  at  the time  of  the\nwheeling request as needing to be built or upgraded either at\nthe time of the request or in the future; and (2) the maximum\ndollar  amount  contained  in  NU's  initial  estimate  of  a\nwheeling customer's pro  rata share  of the  costs of  future\nupgrades  needed  to  accommodate   a  request  for  wheeling\nservice.\"  \n56 F.E.R.C. at 62,031-32.\n\n                             -45-\n\nCommission changed its  policy from the traditional  \"rolled-\n\nin\" approach used  in pricing transmission service.   We hold\n\nthat   the  Commission   provided   a  clear   and   reasoned\n\njustification for  the principles that will  guide its future\n\ndeterminations of  transmission upgrade  pricing.  We  affirm\n\nthe Commission's decision not  to modify the basic principles\n\nadopted in its order.\n\n               b.   Discussion.\n                              \n\n          In accepting as reasonable  the \"but for\" test, the\n\nCommission  has  done no  more than  approve a  framework for\n\ndetermining  cost responsibility  which furthers  the general\n\nprinciple  that transmission  costs should  be born  by those\n\nentities  responsible  for the  cost.    58 F.E.R.C.  61,205.\n\nUnder  this test,  incremental  cost pricing  could be  found\n\nappropriate when firm wheeling across  a particular interface\n\nwould  degrade reliability absent  upgrades.   The Commission\n\nspecifically declined, however, to answer the requests of the\n\nintervenors  to  decide  the \"rolled-in  versus  incremental\"\n\nrate41 issue in  the abstract and  chose instead to  evaluate\n\nit only within the  context of a particular rate  proposal or\n\nupgrade.  Id.   The Commission articulated  how it envisioned\n             \n\n                    \n\n41  Under \"rolled  in\" pricing principles, the upgrade  costs\nwould  be rolled in with  other company costs  and charged to\nall ratepayers as part of NU's  general rate structure; while\nadministratively   simple,   it   ignores  any   concept   of\nresponsibility.  Thus, incremental pricing principles look to\nhold parties responsible for their share of upgrade costs.\n\n                             -46-\n\npricing  transmission  upgrades   and  adopted  a   condition\n\nlimiting  the  amount  NU  may  propose  to  collect  from  a\n\ntransmission customer to the greater of \n\n          (1) the incremental  cost of new  network\n          facilities  required  at  the   time  the\n          customer's new transmission load is added\n          or (2) the rolled-in cost of  all network\n          facilities required to serve the combined\n          transmission loads of [NU], including any\n          required transmission additions.\n\nId. at 61,206.   Thus, a wheeling customer may be charged the\n   \n\ngreater of rolled-in cost rates or incremental cost rates.   \n\n          The Commission acknowledged  that the  introduction\n\nof incremental  cost pricing  principles is a  departure from\n\nits  traditional pricing  policies42 and  justified  this new\n\npolicy  on NU's  unprecedented  obligation  to provide  third\n\nparty transmission service.   Id.  The  Commission noted that\n                                 \n\nincremental  cost  pricing  may  be  appropriate  in  certain\n\ncircumstances,  but  decided to  leave  the  details of  cost\n\nresponsibility  questions to  a  future specific  section 205\n\nrate case.  When such a  case arises, NU will bear the burden\n\nof   justifying  \"any   direct  assignments   of   costs  and\n\nsupport[ing] any arguments that  reliability is degraded by a\n\nparticular  firm transmission  service.    No presumption  is\n\n                    \n\n42     The  Commission generally  has  adhered to  rolled  in\npricing,   but  has   never  precluded   particularized  cost\nallocations to  specific  customers where  appropriate.

The Commission also allowed\n\nthat  any  reliance by  NU  upon the  \"but  for\" test  may be\n\nchallenged in  future actions.   The Commission  sufficiently\n\nexplained and  justified the  principles that will  guide its\n\ntransmission upgrade pricing.\n\n     E.   Opportunity Cost Pricing.\n\n          As has already been discussed, the Commission found\n\nit necessary to impose a number of conditions on the proposed\n\nNU-PSNH merger to mitigate  the merged company's market power\n\nin the  markets for  transmission and short-term  bulk power.\n\n58 F.E.R.C.  at 61,195.    Specifically, the  Commission held\n\nthat  NU  must  provide  firm  transmission  service  out  of\n\nexisting  capacity  for  any   utility,  subject  only  to  a\n\nreservation  of  sufficient  capacity  to  maintain  reliable\n\nservice to its  native load customers  and to honor  existing\n\ncontractual obligations.   NU was  prohibited, however,  from\n\ndenying a request for  firm transmission service by reserving\n\ncapacity for  non-firm transactions  that would enable  it to\n\nprovide more economical service to its native load customers.\n\n56 F.E.R.C.  at 62,014-21;  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,196-200.   FERC\n\nalso  held   that  NU  must  build   additional  transmission\n\nfacilities   as   needed   to   provide   transmission  where\n\ninsufficient capacity  exists.  56 F.E.R.C.  at 62,021-24; 58\n\n                             -48-\n\nF.E.R.C. at 61,204-10.   The Commission found that  these and\n\nother conditions  would  \"adequately mitigate\"  the  merger's\n\nanticompetitive effects.  58 F.E.R.C. at 61,213.\n\n          On rehearing, NU and  the States of Connecticut and\n\nNew Hampshire  argued that the Commission  should address the\n\nissue of  firm transmission  pricing because, in  Opinion No.\n\n364, FERC  had established  principles governing  the related\n\nissue of  firm transmission priority which  made NU's ability\n\nto purchase  inexpensive power (which would lower its cost of\n\nserving  its  native  load  customers)  subordinate  to   its\n\nobligation  to provide  firm transmission for  third parties.\n\n58  F.E.R.C.  at  61,201-02.    The  Commission  agreed,  but\n\ndeclined  to approve  \"opportunity  cost  pricing\"43  outside\n\nthe  context of  a specific  tariff proposal.   Instead,  the\n\nCommission announced three \"basic  goals\" to guide its future\n\ndecisions on the  pricing of firm transmission service on the\n\nmerged company's existing capacity, and left the door open to\n\nNU  to propose  a tariff  based on  opportunity costs  or any\n\n                    \n\n43   As the Commission explained, opportunity costs\n          are the  revenues lost or  costs incurred\n          by  a  utility  in providing  third-party\n          transmission  service  when  transmission\n          capacity is insufficient to  satisfy both\n          a  third-party  wheeling request  and the\n          utility's   own   use.     For   example,\n          opportunity   costs  might   include  the\n          revenues lost or costs incurred because a\n          utility  must  reduce its  own off-system\n          purchases or sales in order to overcome a\n          constraint on the [transmission] grid.\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,200-201.\n\n                             -49-\n\nother  methodology  that would  meet  the three  goals.   The\n\nCommission explained its decision as follows:\n\n            We are now confronted with the need  to\n          provide   NU   with  enough   specificity\n          regarding  what it  will  be  allowed  to\n          propose for the  pricing of future third-\n          party  wheeling  service,  so   that  the\n          company  can  decide  whether to  proceed\n          with the  merger.  We also  cannot ignore\n          the  need  to  act  as  expeditiously  as\n          possible  given the  commercial realities\n          and time pressures presented in corporate\n          matters subject to our  jurisdiction, and\n          in  particular  the  need  to  resolve  a\n          bankruptcy situation.   At the  same time\n          we are confronted with the need to ensure\n          an  adequate record on pricing issues and\n          to   afford   all  parties   an  adequate\n          opportunity to voice their objections.\n            Balancing  these  respective needs,  we\n          conclude  that  the  best  course  is  to\n          provide guidance on  pricing issues,  but\n          to defer specific  pricing issues to  the\n          compliance phase of  this proceeding,  or\n          to subsequent cases where  the Commission\n          may consider specific  proposals from  NU\n          in a concrete, factual setting and with a\n          more developed record.\n          . . . .\n          First, the  native load customers  of the\n                                                   \n          utility  providing  transmission  service\n                                                   \n          should   be   held  harmless.     Second,\n                                                   \n          transmission customers  should be charged\n                                                   \n          the lowest reasonable cost-based rate for\n                                                   \n          third-party transmission service.  Third,\n                                                   \n          the pricing should prevent the collection\n                                                   \n          of  monopoly  rents  by the  transmission\n                                                   \n          owner and  promote efficient transmission\n                                                   \n          decisions.      In  ruling   on  specific\n                   \n          proposed  rates,  we  will balance  these\n          three  goals  in light  of the  facts and\n          circumstances presented at that time.   \n\n58 F.E.R.C. at 61,203 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).\n\n          FERC  was careful  to  point out  that it  endorsed\n\nopportunity cost pricing  only insofar as NU  could show that\n\n                             -50-\n\nit could \"propose rates which  include legitimate, verifiable\n\nopportunity costs.\"  Id.   The Commission warned NU  that any\n                        \n\nsuch  proposal would  be carefully  scrutinized and  would be\n\nsubject to challenge.  Id. at 61,203-04.  Specifically,  FERC\n                          \n\nstated that  NU would  have to  address the  following issues\n\nshould it seek recovery of opportunity costs:\n\n          (1) whether opportunity  costs should  be\n          capped by incremental expansion  costs or\n          any  other  cap;   (2)  whether   current\n          wheeling   and   wholesale   requirements\n          customers  should be  treated differently\n          from   future   wheeling  and   wholesale\n          requirements    customers,    e.g.,    by\n                                            \n          receiving    \"grandfather\"   rights    to\n          embedded cost  rates  for the  amount  of\n          transmission  capacity they  already use;\n          (3) how NU  will identify those customers\n          responsible for growth on its  system and\n          what   particular   new  facilities   are\n          necessary to accommodate that growth; (4)\n          whether  and how third  parties should be\n          protected   from   uncertainty  regarding\n          fluctuations  in  opportunity costs;  (5)\n          how  the proposed rates  will prevent the\n          collection of monopoly rents; and (6) how\n          the  proposed  opportunity costs  will be\n          verified.\n\nId.    The Commission  expressly  postponed consideration  of\n   \n\nwhether opportunity cost pricing  would be inconsistent  with\n\nnondiscriminatory  pricing  and  nondiscriminatory terms  and\n\nconditions of  service until  those issues  were raised  in a\n\nconcrete factual context.  Id. at 61,204, n.118.\n                              \n\n          Petitioners claim that FERC's decision  amounted to\n\nan arbitrary endorsement of opportunity cost pricing that was\n\nnot  supported  by evidence  in  the  record, was  inherently\n\n                             -51-\n\ndiscriminatory, and contrary to FERC's  regulation of natural\n\ngas pipelines.   Petitioners' underlying concern  seems to be\n\nthat  when  the  issue arises  next  in  the  context of  the\n\nCommission's  review  of NU's  compliance  tariff, FERC  will\n\nsimply approve the tariff and dismiss petitioners' objections\n\non the  ground that  opportunity cost pricing  principles had\n\nalready  been  endorsed  by  the  Commission.    Although  we\n\nunderstand petitioners' concerns,  we believe  that they  are\n\nmisplaced and that FERC did not go as far as petitioners fear\n\nin endorsing opportunity cost pricing.\n\n          Petitioners will have an opportunity to contest any\n\ncompliance tariff proposed by NU.  The Commission itself laid\n\nout a number of issues which NU would have to address were it\n\nto  propose a tariff based on opportunity costs.  58 F.E.R.C.\n\nat 61,203.   Only  after carefully considering  the competing\n\ninterests of providing  guidance to  NU as to  what kinds  of\n\ntariffs it would consider, and  the need to endorse  specific\n\nmethodologies only on the  basis of a fully-developed record,\n\ndid  the Commission  decide  to outline  broad pricing  goals\n\nwhich would allow  for a number of pricing  schemes including\n\nopportunity  cost pricing.  Id.   It was  squarely within the\n                               \n\nCommission's  power  to defer  consideration  of petitioners'\n\nassertions until  after NU filed  its compliance tariff.   As\n\nthe  Supreme  Court  has  held,  \"[a]n  agency  enjoys  broad\n\ndiscretion in determining how  to handle related yet discrete\n\n                             -52-\n\nissues  in  terms  of  procedures, and  priorities.\"    Mobil\n                                                             \n\nExploration   &amp;   Producing   Southeast,   Inc.   v.

The  fact that new generating  facilities might wind\n\nup  in different locations than  would have been  the case in\n\nthe absence of  the merger does not approach in significance,\n\nbecause  its  significance  is  not quantifiable,  the  known\n\neffects of  the  merger between  Southern  California  Edison\n\nCompany  and San  Diego Gas  &amp; Electric  Company.   Thus, the\n\nfactual  situation presented in Southern California Edison is\n                                                          \n\ncompletely distinguishable from that of this case.\n\n          The   character  and   location   of   the   future\n\nenvironmental effects of the  NU-PSNH merger are so uncertain\n\nthat  no  meaningful  environmental  review would  have  been\n\npossible, even had  FERC made the effort.  Here, FERC was not\n\napproving  a  regional  development  plan.    It  was  merely\n\napproving a merger between utility companies, albeit a merger\n\ninvolving  two  of  the  largest utilities  in  New  England.\n\nEnergy  demand may increase in New England over the following\n\ndecades, and the fact  of the merger may influence  how those\n\nneeds  are met.  Nevertheless, any attempt by FERC to prepare\n\nan  EIS would  have involved  little more  than spinning  out\n\nmultiple  hypothetical  development forecasts,  with multiple\n\noptions  for   the  type,  amount  and   location  of  future\n\n                             -57-\n\ngenerating facilities.

Once concrete plans have been established\n\nfor   the   construction   of  transmission   or   generating\n\nfacilities, those  proposals will  be reviewed under  NEPA or\n\nthe applicable state environmental review procedures.\n\n          FERC  was justified  in  deciding  that neither  an\n\nenvironmental   assessment   nor   an  environmental   impact\n\nstatement was required prior to approving the NU-PSNH merger.\n\n     G.   HG&amp;E's \"Unique\" Harm.\n\n          HG&amp;E also  contends that because it  relied on PSNH\n\nNew Hampshire  Corridor facilities for over  one-third of its\n\nelectricity supply,  it would be \"uniquely  threatened\" by NU\n\nin head-to-head competition for  large, industrial loads.  To\n\nprotect    itself,   HG&amp;E   requested   that   FERC   either:\n\n(1) disapprove  the merger;  (2) require  the  divestiture or\n\nrestructuring of  NU's retail  business in Holyoke  (HWP); or\n\n(3) grant  HG&amp;E  grandfather  rights to  PSNH  New  Hampshire\n\nCorridor transmission.  The ALJ rejected the \"drastic remedy\"\n\nof divestiture of HWP, stating that it was  \"wholly uncalled-\n\nfor  by anything in this record,\" and holding that HG&amp;E would\n\nbe  adequately  protected by  the  conditions  to the  merger\n\ndesigned   to   address   the  anticompetitive   effects   on\n\ntransmission dependent  utilities (\"TDUs\").   53  F.E.R.C. at\n\n65,232.\n\n          As the ALJ described,\n\n                             -58-\n\n          [t]he  Transmission  Dependent  Utilities\n          (TDUs) are  \"entirely dependent on  NU or\n          PSNH  for  their bulk  power transmission\n          needs.\"  These  companies (most of  which\n          involve municipal ownership) are  not big\n          enough  to  own  or construct  sufficient\n          generation to meet their loads.  As their\n          brief states, they \"are physically unable\n          to  engage in any  bulk power transaction\n                           \n          without using the NU or PSNH transmission\n          systems.  Absent  economic access to NU's\n          or  PSNH's  transmission facilities,  the\n          TDU  cannot  survive  as  an  independent\n          entity.\"   The  TDUs compete with  NU and\n          PSNH in the wholesale bulk  power market;\n          each   TDU,   like  NU/PSNH,   seeks  out\n          attractive sources of  supply.  TDUs thus\n          \"are in  the  uneasy position  of  having\n          their    only    source   of    essential\n          transmission  service  in  the  hands  of\n          their principal competitor.\"  These small\n          companies,    uniquely    vulnerable   to\n          possible  anticompetitive   conduct,  are\n          entitled  to  some measure  of protective\n          assurance regarding NU/PSNH's post merger\n          conduct.\n\n53  F.E.R.C. at 65,232-33.   The ALJ held  that \"[a]ll rates,\n\nterms and  conditions of NU/PSNH transmission  service to the\n\nTDUs in effect  on this date shall . .  . be maintained after\n\nthe merger,  unless and until changes are  either agreed upon\n\nby  the merged  company and  the TDUs,  or authorized  by the\n\nCommission.\"  53 F.E.R.C. at 65,233.  In short, while finding\n\nthat  TDUs  were  \"uniquely  vulnerable\"  to  anticompetitive\n\nconduct by NU-PSNH,  the ALJ  found that HG&amp;E  had not  shown\n\nthat  it was  entitled to  protections beyond those  given to\n\nTDUs  generally.    The  Commission agreed,  56  F.E.R.C.  at\n\n62,049,  but bolstered the protection for TDUs ordered by the\n\n                             -59-\n\nALJ by imposing the additional condition  that NU establish a\n\nspecial tariff for TDUs.  Id. at 62,050.\n                             \n\n          HG&amp;E  points  to  no  evidence  in  the  record  to\n\nindicate  that it  faced anticompetitive consequences  of the\n\nmerger sufficiently  different in  character or magnitude  to\n\nwarrant greater  protections than those given  to other TDUs.\n\nWe therefore affirm the Commission's actions to protect TDUs,\n\nwhich were adequately explained and supported in the record.\n\n     H.

The ALJ interpreted\n\nthat holding as follows:\n\n          The  Commission  made clear  that  in the\n          particular circumstances  surrounding the\n          Seabrook  contract,  it  retains power   \n          through the \"public interest\"  language  \n          to    make   modifications    under   the\n          traditional   just  and   reasonable  and\n          nondiscrimination standards.\n\n53 F.E.R.C.  at  65,235.   The  standard established  by  the\n\nCommission, and  subsequently applied by  the ALJ,  conflates\n\nthe  \"just and  reasonable\" and \"public  interest\" standards,\n\nthereby  circumventing  the  Mobile-Sierra  doctrine.     The\n                                          \n\ndistinction  between the  \"just and  reasonable\" and  \"public\n\ninterest\"  standards  loses  its   meaning  entirely  if  the\n\nCommission may  modify a  contract under the  public interest\n\nstandard  where it  finds  the contract  \"may be  unjust [or]\n\nunreasonable.\"   The  parties'  express intent  was to  avoid\n\nreview  of  rate  schedules  under the  just  and  reasonable\n\nstandard.    Mobile-Sierra protects  their  right  to do  so,\n                          \n\nleaving the Commission  with the power  to modify rates  only\n\nwhen required by the public interest.\n\n                             -63-\n\n          The  Commission  found that  the  SPC  might unduly\n\ndiscriminate  against entities not  parties to  the contract,\n\nand that there was no genuine arm's-length bargaining because\n\nNU and PSNH negotiated the agreement at a time when they knew\n\nthey were about to  merge and have identical interests.   The\n\nCommission held  that, in  this context, it  could \"carefully\n\nscrutinize the  rates, terms and conditions  of the contract\"\n\nto determine if they were just.  Id.\n                                    \n\n          The Commission's  explanation for employing  a just\n\nand  reasonable  standard seems  to  us inadequate.    To the\n\nextent  the  Commission   is  relying  on   NU's  prospective\n\nownership of PSNH, it is unclear why the Commission should be\n\nconcerned    about   protecting   PSNH   from   a   perceived\n\ndisadvantageous arrangement imposed by its  prospective owner\n\nsince any disadvantage visited on  the prospective subsidiary\n\nwill be borne by its owner.  If NU chooses  to allocate risks\n\namong its operating subsidiaries  and one of its subsidiaries\n\nis  disfavored in  this calculation,  there would seem  to be\n\nlittle justification for the Commission stepping in on behalf\n\nof the disfavored subsidiary absent some threat to the public\n\ninterest.\n\n          As for the seller's  market power, reliance on this\n\nfactor  threatens  to  erode  the  Mobile-Sierra doctrine  so\n                                                \n\nsubstantially that  a fuller explanation  from the Commission\n\nis required before  proceeding down this  route.  After  all,\n\n                             -64-\n\nsome  measure of  market power  could be  present in  a large\n\nnumber  of  contracts.    A  case-by-case  inquiry  into  the\n\npresence  and extent of market  power would inject  a new and\n\npotentially  time-consuming  element  into the  Mobile-Sierra\n                                                             \n\nanalysis, and it is not entirely  clear in any event why  the\n\nCommission should protect a buyer who voluntarily enters into\n\nan agreement with a dominant seller.\n\n          The  most attractive case  for affording additional\n\nprotection, despite  the presence of a contract, is where the\n\nprotection is  intended to  safeguard the interests  of third\n\nparties,  notably the  buyer's customers.   The Mobile-Sierra\n                                                             \n\ndoctrine itself allows  for intervention by FERC  where it is\n\nshown  that the  interests of  third parties  are threatened.\n\nMobile,  350  U.S.  at  344-45;  Sierra,  350  U.S.  at  355.\n                                       \n\nHowever, the  standard to be  applied, as  formulated by  the\n\nSupreme  Court, is  the  protection of  outside parties  from\n\n\"undu[e] discriminat[ion]\"  or  imposition of  an  \"excessive\n\nburden.\"  Sierra,  350 U.S. at 355.  If  there is some reason\n                \n\nfor departing from this public interest standard as framed by\n\nthe Supreme Court, the Commission has not supplied it.\n\n          We  assume, without  deciding, that:   (1)  FERC is\n\ncorrect  in its assertion that the State of New Hampshire did\n\nnot adequately represent the  interests of non-parties to the\n\ncontract,  and  that,  therefore,  the SPC  may  have  unduly\n\ndiscriminated  against those non-parties; and (2) the alleged\n\n                             -65-\n\nlack of arms'-length bargaining among NU,  PSNH and the State\n\nof  New Hampshire gave  the Commission the  right to evaluate\n\nthe SPC.  We hold, however,  that the Commission was bound to\n\nfollow  the Mobile-Sierra  doctrine as explicated  by Papago,\n                                                            \n\nand therefore should have evaluated  the SPC under the public\n\ninterest standard, not the just and reasonable standard.\n\n          We  therefore remand this issue for reconsideration\n                              \n\nby FERC under the public interest standard.48\n\nIV.  SUMMARY.\n\n          We affirm  the Commission's orders in  all respects\n                                                             \n\nwith the exception of its modifications of the Seabrook Power\n                                                             \n\nContract filed with the merger  proposal which we remand  for\n                                                             \n\nconsideration under the public interest standard.\n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n48   We have considered, but find unpersuasive, NU's argument\nthat FERC  committed error  when it disrupted  the bankruptcy\nsettlement by modifying the Capacity Interchange Agreements.\n\n                             -66-\n</pre>",
