Smith, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nwith whom Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil\nDivision, and Terri J. Scadron, Assistant Director, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         August 17, 2004\n\f                LIPEZ,    Circuit    Judge.          Petitioner   Stefan      Antonov\n\nMihaylov, a native and citizen of Bulgaria, seeks review of the\n\ndecision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his\n\napplication for asylum.            Petitioner Ludmila Georgeva Naydenova is\n\na derivative asylum applicant.1             Mihaylov argues that the evidence\n\npresented below compels a conclusion that he was persecuted in the\n\npast on account of his political opinion and is therefore entitled\n\nto   a       statutory   presumption   of    a   well-founded     fear   of   future\n\npersecution.         He further claims that the evidence of changed\n\ncircumstances offered by the government is insufficient to overcome\n\nthat presumption and that he is therefore eligible for asylum.\n\n                Ordinarily,   we    review     the    BIA's   decision   under   our\n\ndeferential        \"substantial      evidence\"       standard,    upholding      that\n\ndecision if it is \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"                      INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).                 In this case, however,\n\nwe are unable to conduct a proper substantial evidence review of\n\nthe BIA's decision because neither the BIA nor the Immigration\n\nJudge explained with adequate clarity and particularity the grounds\n\n\n         1\n       Naydenova, Mihaylov's wife, is included in the asylum\npetition based on Mihaylov's experiences.    While this opinion\nrefers primarily to petitioner Mihaylov, the decision rendered\napplies to both petitioners. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\ffor rejecting Mihaylov's past persecution claim.              In light of this\n\nlegally insufficient explanation, see Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34,\n\n44 (1st Cir. 1998), we vacate the BIA's order and remand the case\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            In July 1992, petitioners Stefan Antonov Mihaylov and\n\nLudmila   Georgeva      Naydenova   entered    the   United    States   without\n\ninspection.     The petitioners applied for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval on May 7, 1993.         The Immigration and Nationality Service\n\nhearing officer determined that they were ineligible for asylum and\n\nwithholding, and referred their case to the Immigration Judge.\n\nApproximately five years later, on January 27, 1999, the INS issued\n\nMihaylov and Naydenova notices to appear, charging them with\n\nunlawful presence in the United States in violation of section\n\n212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).               The\n\npetitioners conceded the charge but renewed their request for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal.           They also submitted a petition\n\nfor   relief    under    the   Convention     Against   Torture   (CAT),    and\n\nrequested     voluntary    departure    in   the   event   that   removal   was\n\nnecessary.2     On August 4, 2000, after hearing testimony on the\n\nmerits of the petitioners' claims, the Immigration Judge denied\n\ntheir applications and entered an order of removal to Bulgaria.\n\n\n      2\n       Mihaylov does not appeal the IJ's decision regarding his\nclaims for withholding of removal, relief under the CAT, and\nvoluntary departure.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fThe BIA issued a summary affirmance without opinion on March 28,\n\n2003.3   See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(a)(7).      This petition followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           We summarize the evidence that Mihaylov presented to the\n\nIJ and then discuss the IJ's evaluation of that evidence.            Stefan\n\nMihaylov was born in 1962 in Sofia, Bulgaria.         Mihaylov's father\n\nwas a member of the communist party, but his maternal grandfather,\n\nStefan Todorov Georgiev, was an outspoken critic of Bulgaria's\n\ncommunist regime.      In 1954, the government arrested Georgiev on\n\nfabricated    murder    charges   in   retaliation   for   his    political\n\nactivities, and sentenced him to twelve years in prison.               As a\n\nresult of Georgiev's conviction and sentence, Mihaylov and the\n\nother members of his family were stigmatized as anti-communist\n\ndissidents and enemies of the Bulgarian government.\n\n             By the time that he was thirteen years old, Mihaylov\n\nbegan to have trouble with the communist authorities.            In his last\n\nyear of elementary school, he spoke out against the Communist Youth\n\nLeague (DKMS), which all secondary school students were expected to\n\njoin. Because of his opposition to the DKMS, Mihaylov received low\n\nconduct grades, which precluded him from attending his choice of\n\nsecondary school.      In 1977, the district superintendent of schools\n\nordered Mihaylov to meet with him throughout the year for political\n\n\n     3\n       Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of\nthe IJ, we review the decision of the IJ. Quevedo v. Ashcroft, 336\nF.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                   -4-\n\feducation lessons.       During those sessions, the school official\n\nfrequently struck Mihaylov and threatened to send him to reform\n\nschool if he did not cooperate.\n\n    On April 17, 1978, when Mihaylov was fifteen years old, a\n\nuniformed policeman appeared at the door of his family's apartment\n\nand demanded that Mihaylov accompany him to the police station.\n\nWithout notifying Mihaylov's parents, the policeman took Mihaylov\n\nto an unfamiliar detention facility where he was locked up in a\n\nsmall, windowless cell.       The cell contained only a bed, a bucket\n\nfor a toilet, and a lightbulb which stayed on 24 hours a day.             On\n\nthe day of his detention, Mihaylov suffered a loss of consciousness\n\nand subsequently lost control of his bodily functions.           The prison\n\nguard refused to allow him to bathe or clean his soiled clothes and\n\ndenied   his   request   to   see   a     doctor.     Mihaylov   was   later\n\ninterrogated by two officials who riduculed him for smelling badly,\n\nhumiliated him, and compared him to his grandfather.             They asked\n\nMihaylov where he had been on certain dates, whether he knew\n\ncertain people, and whether he was a member of a political group.\n\nWhen his   answers   did   not   satisfy     them,   the   officials   struck\n\nMihaylov with clubs or their fists on his legs, back, arms, and\n\nface.\n\n           Mihaylov was detained for six or seven days. During that\n\ntime, he was interrogated and beaten frequently and was not allowed\n\nto wash or change his clothes.          On two occasions, he was denied\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\faccess to a toilet.        Mihaylov again requested to see a doctor, and\n\nagain that request was refused.            On April 24, Mihaylov was ordered\n\nto sign a document stating that he had not been harmed, beaten, or\n\nsubjected to force in any way while in custody, and that he had\n\nbeen held only for interrogation.                He was then taken by van to a\n\nlocal Sofia police station and was released.\n\n           In the weeks following his detention, Mihaylov's physical\n\ncondition deteriorated.           He began to lose sensitivity through the\n\nlower part of his body and eventually was unable to walk.                    He was\n\ndiagnosed with acute inflammation of the nerves of his spinal cord\n\nand spent a month in the hospital and three more months in a\n\nrehabilitation center.         He eventually regained his ability to walk\n\nwith a cane, but remained permanently disabled.\n\n           In       the   years      following       his   arrest,    Mihaylov    was\n\nfrequently harassed by government officials                  He was arrested more\n\nthan ten times for minor \"offenses\" such as wearing long hair, blue\n\njeans,   and    a   crucifix;        ordered    to   pay   fines   because   of   his\n\nappearance; and forced to sign an agreement to stay away from\n\ndowntown   Sofia.         On   one    occasion,      Mihaylov   was   arrested    and\n\ndetained on suspicion of dealing in foreign currency.\n\n           In 1989, Mihaylov was detained by a government security\n\nagent, Hristo Rachev, who questioned him about his visits to the\n\nUnited States Embassy and referred to Mihaylov's prior detentions.\n\nRachev threatened to have Mihaylov imprisoned on false charges if\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fhe did not agree to become a government informant.         Mihaylov\n\nreluctantly agreed, and he met with Rachev about 30 times over the\n\nnext year. During those meetings Rachev asked Mihaylov to identify\n\npictures of individuals and to provide information about political\n\nactivities and specific people.    Mihaylov grew increasingly afraid\n\nfor his safety.    On January 30, 1990, he fled Bulgaria with\n\nNaydenova, who was by then his wife, and traveled to Canada.     He\n\napplied for asylum, but that application was denied.    Mihaylov and\n\nNaydenova then entered the United States on July 12, 1992.\n\n          In her supporting testimony, Naydenova stated that after\n\nshe began to live with Mihaylov, she was repeatedly warned by\n\nsecurity officials and threatened with the loss of her job at the\n\nMinistry of Culture if she continued to associate with him because\n\nhe was from a \"bad family.\"   She explained that both her family and\n\nMihaylov's were anti-communist and were mistreated by the communist\n\nparty, and noted that being anti-communist was like a \"sticker\" on\n\none's back that follows you for the rest of your life.           She\n\ndescribed an unsettling phone call to her home in which a man\n\ndemanded to know where Mihaylov was and ordered her to tell him\n\nthat \"his friend Hristo Rachev called.\"     When Naydenova gave her\n\nhusband the message, he began shaking uncontrollably.    Later that\n\nyear, Mihaylov and Naydenova were rounded up as part of a mass\n\ndetention in a particular section of town.      Naydenova explained\n\nthat she and her husband were pulled out of a group at the police\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fstation and ushered into an office, where she was introduced to\n\nRachev, whose name and voice she recognized.                 Mihaylov and Rachev\n\nengaged in a furtive conversation, and the couple was subsequently\n\nreleased.\n\n            Mihaylov also submitted numerous documentary sources in\n\nsupport of his past persecution claim.               Those sources included the\n\nState Department's 1989 Country Report on Human Rights Practices\n\nfor Bulgaria, which described the harsh repression and widespread\n\nhuman rights abuses of Bulgaria's communist regime prior to its\n\ncollapse    in   November       1989,   including       arbitrary       arrest   and\n\ndetention, cruel and unusual treatment and punishment of prisoners,\n\nand \"prison deaths caused by torture and beatings.\" Bulgarian laws\n\n\"provide[d] severe punishment for the voicing of any belief or\n\nconviction which [was] contrary to official policy or critical of\n\nthe State,\" and \"Bulgarians were detained, tried, imprisoned, and\n\nexiled for criticism and actions that were political in nature.\"\n\nThe report described \"the internal security forces which monitored\n\nthe   'ideological'     activities       of    citizens\"      and    \"directed    an\n\nelaborate    system   of       informers      in    virtually    all    workplaces,\n\nresidential areas, and social organizations to monitor the daily\n\nlives of Bulgarians for signs of dissent.\"                      Besides the State\n\nDepartment report, the record contains at least sixteen additional\n\ndocuments   including      a    Radio   Free       Europe   report     on   Bulgaria,\n\nscholarly works, and newspaper articles – all of which discuss the\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fBulgarian Communist regime's persecution of political dissidents.\n\nMihaylov also submitted an affidavit from his mother, and the jail\n\nand character records of his grandfather, which described his\n\ngrandfather's       problems   with    the   communist      government   and   his\n\nfamily's reputation as enemies of the regime.\n\n                In a written opinion that included an extensive, twenty-\n\npage summary of the applicable record evidence but only two pages\n\nof legal analysis, the IJ denied Mihaylov's request for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal, concluding that he had failed to establish\n\npast persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on\n\naccount of his political opinion or membership in a social group.4\n\nShe explained that Mihaylov \"did not establish that the cause of\n\nhis mistreatment by the former Bulgarian authorities was his or his\n\nfamily's political opinion\" or his membership in a social group.\n\nWith respect to his fear of future persecution, the IJ noted that\n\nthe communist regime in Bulgaria collapsed in 1989, citing the\n\nState Department country reports for Bulgaria for 1997 and 1999.\n\nShe stated that Mihaylov \"failed to offer any evidence that any\n\ngovernment agent or other militia member still has any inclination\n\nto punish him for his political belief.\"           The IJ further found that\n\nMihaylov \"failed to meet his burden in establishing a well-founded\n\nfear       of   future   persecution   on    account   of    his   social   group\n\npersecution as a family member.\" (emphasis in the original).\n\n       4\n       Mihaylov does not argue on appeal that he was persecuted on\naccount of his membership in a social group.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f           Although the IJ accepted Mihaylov's account of past\n\nevents, she stated, without elaboration, that \"the Court [found]\n\nhis   reasons   for    the   occurrence     of   th[o]se   events    not   to   be\n\ncredible.\"       She   was    also   troubled     by   Mihaylov's     testimony\n\nconcerning his use of alcohol, referring to it throughout her\n\nopinion and explaining that\n\n      [Mihaylov] presented testimony that must be viewed\n      through the veil of alcoholism, use of other drugs such\n      as Valium, and major depression with anxiety attacks. He\n      repeatedly minimized his use of Valium before this Court\n      when compared with information he gave to Doctor Rines\n      and the female respondent's observations. Further, the\n      amount of alcohol he reported he consumed daily varied\n      widely in amount in his testimony to the Court and in his\n      report to his doctors. The male and female respondents'\n      testimonies concerning the male respondent's drinking\n      were also at variance. The Court notes the oft quoted\n      aphorism that alcoholism is \"a disease of denial.\" The\n      Court, nonetheless, must take his less than forthright\n      report to this Court concerning his addiction to inform\n      his testimony overall.\n\n\nThe IJ also denied Mihaylov's requests for protection under the CAT\n\nand for voluntary departure.         Mihaylov appealed the IJ's decision\n\nto the BIA, which summarily affirmed without opinion.\n\n                                     III.\n\n             We have emphasized the need for clear administrative\n\nfindings in reviewing the decision of the IJ or BIA.                Gailius, 147\n\nF.3d at 46-47.    \"A reviewing court should judge the action of [the\n\nBIA] based only on reasoning provided by the agency, not based on\n\ngrounds constructed by the reviewing court,\" Yatskin v. INS, 255\n\nF.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001), and \"that basis must be set forth with\n\n                                     -10-\n\fsuch clarity as to be understandable,\" Gailius, 147 F.3d at 46-47.\n\nLikewise, \"in the case of an adverse credibility determination, the\n\nIJ must offer a specific, cogent reason for [her] disbelief.\" Qin\n\nv. Ashcroft, 360 F.3d 302, 306 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation and\n\ninternal quotations omitted).      Thus, we will remand if the agency\n\nfails to state \"with sufficient particularity and clarity the\n\nreasons for denial of asylum\" or otherwise to \"offer legally\n\nsufficient reasons for its decision.\"        Gailius, 147 F.3d at 46-47.\n\n          An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing that\n\nhe or she meets the statutory definition of a refugee and is\n\ntherefore eligible for asylum.      8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).           Applicants\n\nmay meet this burden in one of two ways.             First, an applicant\n\nqualifies as a refugee if he or she demonstrates a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.               8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b); El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 202-03\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).     Alternatively, the applicant is entitled to a\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of persecution if he or she\n\nestablishes   past   persecution   on     account   of   one   of    the   five\n\nstatutory grounds.    8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); Yatskin, 255 F.3d at\n\n9.\n\n          In the present case, the IJ did not reject Mihaylov's\n\nclaim that he was persecuted. Rather, she concluded that he failed\n\nto demonstrate that the persecution was on account of his political\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fopinion.         She offered only one specific reason in support of this\n\nruling, stating that Mihaylov admitted that he may have been\n\ndetained         in   1972   for   an    ordinary    crime   rather    than    for   his\n\npolitical opinion:\n\n       [A]lthough the male respondent claims he was initially\n       detained because he was targeted for his political\n       opinion, he later admitted that the police searched the\n       family's home and that there may have been a criminal\n       matter involved. In such a case, the police would have\n       been within their authority to detain a suspect . . . .\n\n                 We do not agree that Mihaylov \"later admit[ted]\" in the\n\ncourse of his testimony that he may have been detained on suspicion\n\nof having committed a non-political crime.                   Rather, his testimony\n\nconsistently conveyed his belief that he was detained because of\n\nhis political opinion.             During cross examination, the INS attorney\n\nquestioned Mihaylov about a potential discrepancy between his\n\ntestimony and what he told the asylum officer during his initial\n\ninterview in 1998 about whether he was arrested for a crime or for\n\nhis political opinion.             Although Mihaylov acknowledged that he had\n\ntold the asylum officer that he was detained because he was\n\nsuspected of criminal activities, he explained that \"in Bulgaria\n\nboth       the   political     and      criminal    activities   are   being    called\n\ncriminal activities.\"5               Hence, the IJ's finding that Mihaylov\n\n       5\n        Mihaylov's explanation was supported by the State\nDepartment's 1989 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for\nBulgaria, which Mihaylov submitted in support of his asylum\napplication.   That report stated that many forms of political\ndissent were then characterized as crimes under the Bulgarian Penal\nCode, which prohibited \"crimes against the People's Republic, anti-\nstate agitation and propaganda, slander against the State,\n\n                                            -12-\n\fadmitted that he may have been detained for a crime relies on a\n\nmischaracterization      of   the     evidence    and    does   not     provide   a\n\nlegitimate      basis   for   her     rejection    of    his    claim     of    past\n\npersecution.\n\n              Aside from this unsupportable finding of a discrepancy in\n\nMihaylov's testimony as to the motivation for his detention, the IJ\n\noffered no specific reasoning in support of her conclusion that\n\nMihaylov failed to prove that his persecution was on account of his\n\npolitical opinion. That void is particularly troubling in light of\n\nthe considerable evidence of political persecution that we have\n\nsummarized above. Although the IJ described Mihaylov's testimonial\n\nevidence at some length at the beginning of her opinion, she failed\n\nto   relate    that   evidence   to   her    rejection    of    Mihaylov's      past\n\npersecution claim.      Mihaylov's documentary evidence received even\n\nless consideration; while the IJ briefly noted that \"[t]he Court\n\nreceived the Amended I-589 and Supporting Documents into evidence,\"\n\nher opinion did not discuss any of the documents submitted with\n\nMihaylov's     asylum   application,     many     of    which   related    to    the\n\nconnection between his past persecution and political opinion.\n\nAlthough an IJ need not discuss every piece of evidence produced by\n\nan asylum applicant, she must give reasoned consideration to the\n\npetition and may not ignore substantial testimonial and documentary\n\n\n\nspreading untrue allegations about the Government, and committing\nacts that create distrust toward the Government.\" (internal\nquotations omitted).\n\n                                      -13-\n\fevidence.     See Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nMihaylov's    evidence        of   past      persecution         was    substantial      and\n\nimportant, and the IJ's silence about it does little to assure us\n\nthat it was considered.            If Mihaylov's testimony and supporting\n\ndocumentary        evidence     are    true,       he     may    well       have   suffered\n\npersecution in the past on account of his political opinion.\n\n             The     IJ     also      made    an        odd     credibility        finding.\n\nSpecifically,       the    IJ   found     that      while       Mihaylov      \"provided    a\n\nconsistent,    basic       skeletal     outline         of    events,       including    his\n\ndetention at age 15, and other encounters, the Court finds his\n\nreasons for the occurrence of these events not to be credible.\"\n\n(emphasis added).          This finding seems to rest on the premise that\n\nMihaylov's    assertion         that    he    was    persecuted         because     of   his\n\npolitical opinion is itself an evidentiary fact to be credited or\n\ndiscredited.         Yet    Mihaylov      does      not      claim     to   have   personal\n\nknowledge of his persecutors' motives, nor does his theory about\n\nthose motives constitute a fact from which the IJ could infer that\n\nMihaylov was persecuted because of his political opinion.                            Hence,\n\nthe relevant question is not whether Mihaylov's proffered reasons\n\nfor his persecution are credible but whether he has provided \"some\n\nevidence . . . , direct or circumstantial\" that his persecutors\n\nwere motivated, at least in part, by his political opinion.6\n\n     6\n       Here, as is usual in asylum cases, there is no direct\nevidence as to why Mihaylov was detained, beaten, harassed, and\nforcibly recruited as an informer. Therefore, the IJ should have\nconsidered whether the objective facts in the record created a\n\n                                          -14-\n\fElias-Zacarias,      502    U.S.    at   483    (emphasis      in    the    original).\n\nTherefore, the IJ's adverse credibility finding was misplaced.\n\n               Finally, and relatedly, the IJ's opinion is suffused with\n\nsuggestions       that     Mihaylov's      present     use      of     alcohol      and\n\ninconsistencies in his testimony concerning that use undermined his\n\ncredibility as a general matter.           Yet, there is no evidence in the\n\nrecord, expert or otherwise, that Mihaylov was an alcoholic, nor\n\ndid the IJ explain what bearing Mihaylov's alcohol use could have\n\nhad on the legal issues.           Some of the IJ's observations appear to\n\nrelate    to    Mihaylov's    competence        to   testify    rather       than   his\n\ncredibility, notwithstanding that she expressly found that he was\n\na competent witness.7        Other statements note discrepancies between\n\nMihaylov's testimony concerning his daily alcohol consumption and\n\nthe testimony of his wife and doctors, without explaining how those\n\ndiscrepancies bear any legitimate relationship to Mihaylov's asylum\n\nclaim.    See Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (explaining that an adverse credibility determination \"must\n\nbe based on discrepancies that involved the heart of the asylum\n\nclaim\")    (citation and internal quotations omitted).                     Ultimately,\n\nit is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the IJ's legal\n\n\n\nreasonable inference that Mihaylov was persecuted because of his\npolitical opinion.\n     7\n       A \"competent witness\" is \"a witness who is legally qualified\nto testify\" whereas a \"credible witness\" is \"a witness whose\ntestimony is believable.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1596 (7th ed.\n1999).\n\n                                         -15-\n\fconclusions were colored by her assumptions and personal views\n\nabout individuals who abuse drugs and alcohol.        This suggestion of\n\na lack of impartiality further undermines our confidence in the\n\nreasons given by the IJ in support of her finding that Mihaylov\n\nfailed to establish past persecution. See Cordero-Trejo v. INS, 40\n\nF.3d 482, 487 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"[D]eference is not due where\n\nfindings and conclusions are based on inferences or presumptions\n\nthat are not reasonably grounded in the record, viewed as a whole,\n\nor are merely personal views of the immigration judge.\").\n\n            Where, as here, the IJ's reasoning is inadequate to\n\nsupport a finding of past persecution, we generally must remand to\n\nthe BIA.    This is so because if Mihaylov did in fact establish past\n\npersecution, he was entitled to a regulatory presumption of a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution. El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 204-05\n\n(citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)).      In that case, the burden should\n\nhave shifted to the government to refute that presumption by\n\nestablishing    a   fundamental   change   of   circumstances   such   that\n\nMihaylov no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.               8\n\nC.F.R. §     208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).    Here, the government never had to\n\nface that burden.\n\n             The government suggests, however, that it met that burden\n\nin any event by showing evidence of changed country conditions in\n\nBulgaria, namely that the former communist regime is no longer in\n\npower.     See Yatskin, 255 F.3d at 9-11 (excusing as harmless error\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthe BIA's    failure    to       provide       a    reasoned       basis      for    rejecting\n\npetitioner's past persecution claim where uncontested evidence of\n\nchanged country conditions overcame any presumption of a well-\n\nfounded    fear).      We    do    not    agree          that    the    record       compels    a\n\nconclusion that changed country conditions obviated any presumptive\n\nwell-founded fear in Mihaylov's case.                          A regime change does not\n\nnecessarily eliminate the objective basis for an applicant's fear\n\nof persecution at the hands of his former oppressors, even if those\n\nindividuals were part of the old regime.                         As the Seventh Circuit\n\nrecently explained, citing much of the same documentary evidence\n\nprovided by Mihaylov, \"there is evidence that Bulgaria's former\n\ncommunist bigwigs, quickly recycled as socialists and now busy\n\ncosying up to the United States, retain significant power in\n\nBulgaria,    especially       and       quite       relevantly         over    the    security\n\nservice,    and     continue       to    pursue          the    old    vendettas       against\n\nanticommunists.\"       Niam v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 652, 657 (7th Cir.\n\n2004) (holding that regime change in Bulgaria did not establish\n\nthat asylum       applicant       who    had       been   persecuted          for    his   anti-\n\ncommunist    beliefs        no     longer          had    a      well-founded         fear     of\n\npersecution).\n\n            Thus, the IJ's failure to provide adequate reasons for\n\nher rejection of Mihaylov's past persecution claim leaves us\n\nwithout a sufficient basis to affirm the BIA's decision.

See Gailius, 147 F.3d at 47\n\n(noting that remand is appropriate in the asylum context \"when a\n\nreviewing court cannot sustain the agency's decision because it has\n\nfailed to offer legally sufficient reasons for its decision\").\n\n                                     IV.\n\n             The order of the BIA is vacated, and the case is remanded\n\nto the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n             So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f",

The petitioners applied for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval on May 7, 1993.         The Immigration and Nationality Service\n\nhearing officer determined that they were ineligible for asylum and\n\nwithholding, and referred their case to the Immigration Judge.\n\nApproximately five years later, on January 27, 1999, the INS issued\n\nMihaylov and Naydenova notices to appear, charging them with\n\nunlawful presence in the United States in violation of section\n\n212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).               The\n\npetitioners conceded the charge but renewed their request for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal.           They also submitted a petition\n\nfor   relief    under    the   Convention     Against   Torture   (CAT),    and\n\nrequested     voluntary    departure    in   the   event   that   removal   was\n\nnecessary.2     On August 4, 2000, after hearing testimony on the\n\nmerits of the petitioners' claims, the Immigration Judge denied\n\ntheir applications and entered an order of removal to Bulgaria.\n\n\n      2\n       Mihaylov does not appeal the IJ's decision regarding his\nclaims for withholding of removal, relief under the CAT, and\nvoluntary departure.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fThe BIA issued a summary affirmance without opinion on March 28,\n\n2003.3   See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(a)(7).      This petition followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           We summarize the evidence that Mihaylov presented to the\n\nIJ and then discuss the IJ's evaluation of that evidence.            Stefan\n\nMihaylov was born in 1962 in Sofia, Bulgaria.         Mihaylov's father\n\nwas a member of the communist party, but his maternal grandfather,\n\nStefan Todorov Georgiev, was an outspoken critic of Bulgaria's\n\ncommunist regime.      In 1954, the government arrested Georgiev on\n\nfabricated    murder    charges   in   retaliation   for   his    political\n\nactivities, and sentenced him to twelve years in prison.               As a\n\nresult of Georgiev's conviction and sentence, Mihaylov and the\n\nother members of his family were stigmatized as anti-communist\n\ndissidents and enemies of the Bulgarian government.\n\n             By the time that he was thirteen years old, Mihaylov\n\nbegan to have trouble with the communist authorities.            In his last\n\nyear of elementary school, he spoke out against the Communist Youth\n\nLeague (DKMS), which all secondary school students were expected to\n\njoin. Because of his opposition to the DKMS, Mihaylov received low\n\nconduct grades, which precluded him from attending his choice of\n\nsecondary school.      In 1977, the district superintendent of schools\n\nordered Mihaylov to meet with him throughout the year for political\n\n\n     3\n       Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of\nthe IJ, we review the decision of the IJ.

During those sessions, the school official\n\nfrequently struck Mihaylov and threatened to send him to reform\n\nschool if he did not cooperate.\n\n    On April 17, 1978, when Mihaylov was fifteen years old, a\n\nuniformed policeman appeared at the door of his family's apartment\n\nand demanded that Mihaylov accompany him to the police station.\n\nWithout notifying Mihaylov's parents, the policeman took Mihaylov\n\nto an unfamiliar detention facility where he was locked up in a\n\nsmall, windowless cell.       The cell contained only a bed, a bucket\n\nfor a toilet, and a lightbulb which stayed on 24 hours a day.             On\n\nthe day of his detention, Mihaylov suffered a loss of consciousness\n\nand subsequently lost control of his bodily functions.           The prison\n\nguard refused to allow him to bathe or clean his soiled clothes and\n\ndenied   his   request   to   see   a     doctor.     Mihaylov   was   later\n\ninterrogated by two officials who riduculed him for smelling badly,\n\nhumiliated him, and compared him to his grandfather.             They asked\n\nMihaylov where he had been on certain dates, whether he knew\n\ncertain people, and whether he was a member of a political group.\n\nWhen his   answers   did   not   satisfy     them,   the   officials   struck\n\nMihaylov with clubs or their fists on his legs, back, arms, and\n\nface.\n\n           Mihaylov was detained for six or seven days. During that\n\ntime, he was interrogated and beaten frequently and was not allowed\n\nto wash or change his clothes.          On two occasions, he was denied\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\faccess to a toilet.        Mihaylov again requested to see a doctor, and\n\nagain that request was refused.            On April 24, Mihaylov was ordered\n\nto sign a document stating that he had not been harmed, beaten, or\n\nsubjected to force in any way while in custody, and that he had\n\nbeen held only for interrogation.                He was then taken by van to a\n\nlocal Sofia police station and was released.\n\n           In the weeks following his detention, Mihaylov's physical\n\ncondition deteriorated.           He began to lose sensitivity through the\n\nlower part of his body and eventually was unable to walk.                    He was\n\ndiagnosed with acute inflammation of the nerves of his spinal cord\n\nand spent a month in the hospital and three more months in a\n\nrehabilitation center.         He eventually regained his ability to walk\n\nwith a cane, but remained permanently disabled.\n\n           In       the   years      following       his   arrest,    Mihaylov    was\n\nfrequently harassed by government officials                  He was arrested more\n\nthan ten times for minor \"offenses\" such as wearing long hair, blue\n\njeans,   and    a   crucifix;        ordered    to   pay   fines   because   of   his\n\nappearance; and forced to sign an agreement to stay away from\n\ndowntown   Sofia.         On   one    occasion,      Mihaylov   was   arrested    and\n\ndetained on suspicion of dealing in foreign currency.\n\n           In 1989, Mihaylov was detained by a government security\n\nagent, Hristo Rachev, who questioned him about his visits to the\n\nUnited States Embassy and referred to Mihaylov's prior detentions.\n\nRachev threatened to have Mihaylov imprisoned on false charges if\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fhe did not agree to become a government informant.         Mihaylov\n\nreluctantly agreed, and he met with Rachev about 30 times over the\n\nnext year. During those meetings Rachev asked Mihaylov to identify\n\npictures of individuals and to provide information about political\n\nactivities and specific people.    Mihaylov grew increasingly afraid\n\nfor his safety.    On January 30, 1990, he fled Bulgaria with\n\nNaydenova, who was by then his wife, and traveled to Canada.     He\n\napplied for asylum, but that application was denied.    Mihaylov and\n\nNaydenova then entered the United States on July 12, 1992.\n\n          In her supporting testimony, Naydenova stated that after\n\nshe began to live with Mihaylov, she was repeatedly warned by\n\nsecurity officials and threatened with the loss of her job at the\n\nMinistry of Culture if she continued to associate with him because\n\nhe was from a \"bad family.\"   She explained that both her family and\n\nMihaylov's were anti-communist and were mistreated by the communist\n\nparty, and noted that being anti-communist was like a \"sticker\" on\n\none's back that follows you for the rest of your life.           She\n\ndescribed an unsettling phone call to her home in which a man\n\ndemanded to know where Mihaylov was and ordered her to tell him\n\nthat \"his friend Hristo Rachev called.\"     When Naydenova gave her\n\nhusband the message, he began shaking uncontrollably.    Later that\n\nyear, Mihaylov and Naydenova were rounded up as part of a mass\n\ndetention in a particular section of town.      Naydenova explained\n\nthat she and her husband were pulled out of a group at the police\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fstation and ushered into an office, where she was introduced to\n\nRachev, whose name and voice she recognized.                 Mihaylov and Rachev\n\nengaged in a furtive conversation, and the couple was subsequently\n\nreleased.\n\n            Mihaylov also submitted numerous documentary sources in\n\nsupport of his past persecution claim.               Those sources included the\n\nState Department's 1989 Country Report on Human Rights Practices\n\nfor Bulgaria, which described the harsh repression and widespread\n\nhuman rights abuses of Bulgaria's communist regime prior to its\n\ncollapse    in   November       1989,   including       arbitrary       arrest   and\n\ndetention, cruel and unusual treatment and punishment of prisoners,\n\nand \"prison deaths caused by torture and beatings.\" Bulgarian laws\n\n\"provide[d] severe punishment for the voicing of any belief or\n\nconviction which [was] contrary to official policy or critical of\n\nthe State,\" and \"Bulgarians were detained, tried, imprisoned, and\n\nexiled for criticism and actions that were political in nature.\"\n\nThe report described \"the internal security forces which monitored\n\nthe   'ideological'     activities       of    citizens\"      and    \"directed    an\n\nelaborate    system   of       informers      in    virtually    all    workplaces,\n\nresidential areas, and social organizations to monitor the daily\n\nlives of Bulgarians for signs of dissent.\"                      Besides the State\n\nDepartment report, the record contains at least sixteen additional\n\ndocuments   including      a    Radio   Free       Europe   report     on   Bulgaria,\n\nscholarly works, and newspaper articles – all of which discuss the\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fBulgarian Communist regime's persecution of political dissidents.\n\nMihaylov also submitted an affidavit from his mother, and the jail\n\nand character records of his grandfather, which described his\n\ngrandfather's       problems   with    the   communist      government   and   his\n\nfamily's reputation as enemies of the regime.\n\n                In a written opinion that included an extensive, twenty-\n\npage summary of the applicable record evidence but only two pages\n\nof legal analysis, the IJ denied Mihaylov's request for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal, concluding that he had failed to establish\n\npast persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on\n\naccount of his political opinion or membership in a social group.4\n\nShe explained that Mihaylov \"did not establish that the cause of\n\nhis mistreatment by the former Bulgarian authorities was his or his\n\nfamily's political opinion\" or his membership in a social group.\n\nWith respect to his fear of future persecution, the IJ noted that\n\nthe communist regime in Bulgaria collapsed in 1989, citing the\n\nState Department country reports for Bulgaria for 1997 and 1999.\n\nShe stated that Mihaylov \"failed to offer any evidence that any\n\ngovernment agent or other militia member still has any inclination\n\nto punish him for his political belief.\"           The IJ further found that\n\nMihaylov \"failed to meet his burden in establishing a well-founded\n\nfear       of   future   persecution   on    account   of    his   social   group\n\npersecution as a family member.\" (emphasis in the original).\n\n       4\n       Mihaylov does not argue on appeal that he was persecuted on\naccount of his membership in a social group.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f           Although the IJ accepted Mihaylov's account of past\n\nevents, she stated, without elaboration, that \"the Court [found]\n\nhis   reasons   for    the   occurrence     of   th[o]se   events    not   to   be\n\ncredible.\"       She   was    also   troubled     by   Mihaylov's     testimony\n\nconcerning his use of alcohol, referring to it throughout her\n\nopinion and explaining that\n\n      [Mihaylov] presented testimony that must be viewed\n      through the veil of alcoholism, use of other drugs such\n      as Valium, and major depression with anxiety attacks. He\n      repeatedly minimized his use of Valium before this Court\n      when compared with information he gave to Doctor Rines\n      and the female respondent's observations. Further, the\n      amount of alcohol he reported he consumed daily varied\n      widely in amount in his testimony to the Court and in his\n      report to his doctors. The male and female respondents'\n      testimonies concerning the male respondent's drinking\n      were also at variance. The Court notes the oft quoted\n      aphorism that alcoholism is \"a disease of denial.\" The\n      Court, nonetheless, must take his less than forthright\n      report to this Court concerning his addiction to inform\n      his testimony overall.\n\n\nThe IJ also denied Mihaylov's requests for protection under the CAT\n\nand for voluntary departure.         Mihaylov appealed the IJ's decision\n\nto the BIA, which summarily affirmed without opinion.\n\n                                     III.\n\n             We have emphasized the need for clear administrative\n\nfindings in reviewing the decision of the IJ or BIA.

Thus, we will remand if the agency\n\nfails to state \"with sufficient particularity and clarity the\n\nreasons for denial of asylum\" or otherwise to \"offer legally\n\nsufficient reasons for its decision.\"        Gailius, 147 F.3d at 46-47.\n\n          An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing that\n\nhe or she meets the statutory definition of a refugee and is\n\ntherefore eligible for asylum.      8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).           Applicants\n\nmay meet this burden in one of two ways.             First, an applicant\n\nqualifies as a refugee if he or she demonstrates a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.               8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b); El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200506\"><a href=\"/opinion/200506/el-moraghy-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202-03\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).     Alternatively, the applicant is entitled to a\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of persecution if he or she\n\nestablishes   past   persecution   on     account   of   one   of    the   five\n\nstatutory grounds.    8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); Yatskin, 255 F.3d at\n\n9.\n\n          In the present case, the IJ did not reject Mihaylov's\n\nclaim that he was persecuted. Rather, she concluded that he failed\n\nto demonstrate that the persecution was on account of his political\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fopinion.         She offered only one specific reason in support of this\n\nruling, stating that Mihaylov admitted that he may have been\n\ndetained         in   1972   for   an    ordinary    crime   rather    than    for   his\n\npolitical opinion:\n\n       [A]lthough the male respondent claims he was initially\n       detained because he was targeted for his political\n       opinion, he later admitted that the police searched the\n       family's home and that there may have been a criminal\n       matter involved. In such a case, the police would have\n       been within their authority to detain a suspect . . . .\n\n                 We do not agree that Mihaylov \"later admit[ted]\" in the\n\ncourse of his testimony that he may have been detained on suspicion\n\nof having committed a non-political crime.                   Rather, his testimony\n\nconsistently conveyed his belief that he was detained because of\n\nhis political opinion.             During cross examination, the INS attorney\n\nquestioned Mihaylov about a potential discrepancy between his\n\ntestimony and what he told the asylum officer during his initial\n\ninterview in 1998 about whether he was arrested for a crime or for\n\nhis political opinion.             Although Mihaylov acknowledged that he had\n\ntold the asylum officer that he was detained because he was\n\nsuspected of criminal activities, he explained that \"in Bulgaria\n\nboth       the   political     and      criminal    activities   are   being    called\n\ncriminal activities.\"5               Hence, the IJ's finding that Mihaylov\n\n       5\n        Mihaylov's explanation was supported by the State\nDepartment's 1989 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for\nBulgaria, which Mihaylov submitted in support of his asylum\napplication.   That report stated that many forms of political\ndissent were then characterized as crimes under the Bulgarian Penal\nCode, which prohibited \"crimes against the People's Republic, anti-\nstate agitation and propaganda, slander against the State,\n\n                                            -12-\n\fadmitted that he may have been detained for a crime relies on a\n\nmischaracterization      of   the     evidence    and    does   not     provide   a\n\nlegitimate      basis   for   her     rejection    of    his    claim     of    past\n\npersecution.\n\n              Aside from this unsupportable finding of a discrepancy in\n\nMihaylov's testimony as to the motivation for his detention, the IJ\n\noffered no specific reasoning in support of her conclusion that\n\nMihaylov failed to prove that his persecution was on account of his\n\npolitical opinion. That void is particularly troubling in light of\n\nthe considerable evidence of political persecution that we have\n\nsummarized above. Although the IJ described Mihaylov's testimonial\n\nevidence at some length at the beginning of her opinion, she failed\n\nto   relate    that   evidence   to   her    rejection    of    Mihaylov's      past\n\npersecution claim.      Mihaylov's documentary evidence received even\n\nless consideration; while the IJ briefly noted that \"[t]he Court\n\nreceived the Amended I-589 and Supporting Documents into evidence,\"\n\nher opinion did not discuss any of the documents submitted with\n\nMihaylov's     asylum   application,     many     of    which   related    to    the\n\nconnection between his past persecution and political opinion.\n\nAlthough an IJ need not discuss every piece of evidence produced by\n\nan asylum applicant, she must give reasoned consideration to the\n\npetition and may not ignore substantial testimonial and documentary\n\n\n\nspreading untrue allegations about the Government, and committing\nacts that create distrust toward the Government.\" (internal\nquotations omitted).\n\n                                      -13-\n\fevidence.     See Morales v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768205\"><a href=\"/opinion/768205/juan-antonio-morales-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nMihaylov's    evidence        of   past      persecution         was    substantial      and\n\nimportant, and the IJ's silence about it does little to assure us\n\nthat it was considered.            If Mihaylov's testimony and supporting\n\ndocumentary        evidence     are    true,       he     may    well       have   suffered\n\npersecution in the past on account of his political opinion.\n\n             The     IJ     also      made    an        odd     credibility        finding.\n\nSpecifically,       the    IJ   found     that      while       Mihaylov      \"provided    a\n\nconsistent,    basic       skeletal     outline         of    events,       including    his\n\ndetention at age 15, and other encounters, the Court finds his\n\nreasons for the occurrence of these events not to be credible.\"\n\n(emphasis added).          This finding seems to rest on the premise that\n\nMihaylov's    assertion         that    he    was    persecuted         because     of   his\n\npolitical opinion is itself an evidentiary fact to be credited or\n\ndiscredited.         Yet    Mihaylov      does      not      claim     to   have   personal\n\nknowledge of his persecutors' motives, nor does his theory about\n\nthose motives constitute a fact from which the IJ could infer that\n\nMihaylov was persecuted because of his political opinion.                            Hence,\n\nthe relevant question is not whether Mihaylov's proffered reasons\n\nfor his persecution are credible but whether he has provided \"some\n\nevidence . . . , direct or circumstantial\" that his persecutors\n\nwere motivated, at least in part, by his political opinion.6\n\n     6\n       Here, as is usual in asylum cases, there is no direct\nevidence as to why Mihaylov was detained, beaten, harassed, and\nforcibly recruited as an informer. Therefore, the IJ should have\nconsidered whether the objective facts in the record created a\n\n                                          -14-\n\fElias-Zacarias,      502    U.S.    at   483    (emphasis      in    the    original).\n\nTherefore, the IJ's adverse credibility finding was misplaced.\n\n               Finally, and relatedly, the IJ's opinion is suffused with\n\nsuggestions       that     Mihaylov's      present     use      of     alcohol      and\n\ninconsistencies in his testimony concerning that use undermined his\n\ncredibility as a general matter.           Yet, there is no evidence in the\n\nrecord, expert or otherwise, that Mihaylov was an alcoholic, nor\n\ndid the IJ explain what bearing Mihaylov's alcohol use could have\n\nhad on the legal issues.           Some of the IJ's observations appear to\n\nrelate    to    Mihaylov's    competence        to   testify    rather       than   his\n\ncredibility, notwithstanding that she expressly found that he was\n\na competent witness.7        Other statements note discrepancies between\n\nMihaylov's testimony concerning his daily alcohol consumption and\n\nthe testimony of his wife and doctors, without explaining how those\n\ndiscrepancies bear any legitimate relationship to Mihaylov's asylum\n\nclaim.    See Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198686\"><a href=\"/opinion/198686/bojorquez-villanueva-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (explaining that an adverse credibility determination \"must\n\nbe based on discrepancies that involved the heart of the asylum\n\nclaim\")    (citation and internal quotations omitted).                     Ultimately,\n\nit is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the IJ's legal\n\n\n\nreasonable inference that Mihaylov was persecuted because of his\npolitical opinion.\n     7\n       A \"competent witness\" is \"a witness who is legally qualified\nto testify\" whereas a \"credible witness\" is \"a witness whose\ntestimony is believable.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1596 (7th ed.\n1999).\n\n                                         -15-\n\fconclusions were colored by her assumptions and personal views\n\nabout individuals who abuse drugs and alcohol.        This suggestion of\n\na lack of impartiality further undermines our confidence in the\n\nreasons given by the IJ in support of her finding that Mihaylov\n\nfailed to establish past persecution. See Cordero-Trejo v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195749\"><a href=\"/opinion/195749/cordero-trejo-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"[D]eference is not due where\n\nfindings and conclusions are based on inferences or presumptions\n\nthat are not reasonably grounded in the record, viewed as a whole,\n\nor are merely personal views of the immigration judge.\").\n\n            Where, as here, the IJ's reasoning is inadequate to\n\nsupport a finding of past persecution, we generally must remand to\n\nthe BIA.    This is so because if Mihaylov did in fact establish past\n\npersecution, he was entitled to a regulatory presumption of a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution. El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 204-05\n\n(citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)).      In that case, the burden should\n\nhave shifted to the government to refute that presumption by\n\nestablishing    a   fundamental   change   of   circumstances   such   that\n\nMihaylov no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.               8\n\nC.F.R. §     208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).    Here, the government never had to\n\nface that burden.\n\n             The government suggests, however, that it met that burden\n\nin any event by showing evidence of changed country conditions in\n\nBulgaria, namely that the former communist regime is no longer in\n\npower.     See Yatskin, 255 F.3d at 9-11 (excusing as harmless error\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthe BIA's    failure    to       provide       a    reasoned       basis      for    rejecting\n\npetitioner's past persecution claim where uncontested evidence of\n\nchanged country conditions overcame any presumption of a well-\n\nfounded    fear).      We    do    not    agree          that    the    record       compels    a\n\nconclusion that changed country conditions obviated any presumptive\n\nwell-founded fear in Mihaylov's case.                          A regime change does not\n\nnecessarily eliminate the objective basis for an applicant's fear\n\nof persecution at the hands of his former oppressors, even if those\n\nindividuals were part of the old regime.                         As the Seventh Circuit\n\nrecently explained, citing much of the same documentary evidence\n\nprovided by Mihaylov, \"there is evidence that Bulgaria's former\n\ncommunist bigwigs, quickly recycled as socialists and now busy\n\ncosying up to the United States, retain significant power in\n\nBulgaria,    especially       and       quite       relevantly         over    the    security\n\nservice,    and     continue       to    pursue          the    old    vendettas       against\n\nanticommunists.\"       Niam v.
