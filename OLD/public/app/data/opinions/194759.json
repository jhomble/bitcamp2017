On  September 18,  1990, a\n                               \n\nfederal  grand  jury  returned  a  multiple count  indictment\n\nagainst defendant-appellant J. Edward McHugh, a former senior\n\nvice-president  and loan officer of the Cambridgeport Savings\n\nBank  (\"CSB\"), and  defendant-appellant James  F.  Brennan, a\n\nborrower of large  sums of  money from CSB.   The  indictment\n\ncharged  both  defendants with  one  count  of conspiracy  to\n\ncommit  bank  fraud and  to  willfully  misapply bank  funds;\n\nMcHugh  with one count of  bank fraud, six  counts of willful\n\nmisapplication of bank funds, and four counts of making false\n\nentries in  bank  records; and  Brennan  with two  counts  of\n\nmaking false  statements to a lending  institution, one count\n\nof aiding and abetting McHugh's bank fraud, and six counts of\n\naiding and  abetting McHugh's willful misapplication  of bank\n\nfunds.  After a twenty-day trial, a jury returned verdicts of\n\nguilty against both  defendants on  most of the  counts.   It\n\ndid,  however,  acquit  McHugh   on  two  counts  of  willful\n\nmisapplication  and  Brennan  on  one  count  of  aiding  and\n\nabetting a willful misapplication of bank funds.  \n\n          Following  the verdict,  the trial  judge issued  a\n\ncomprehensive, twenty-seven page memorandum and order denying\n\nBrennan's pending motion for acquittal on all counts charged,\n\nbut granting McHugh's pending motion for acquittal insofar as\n\nit related to  the four  counts for making  false entries  in\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nbank records.1   After a two-day  sentencing hearing, Brennan\n\nwas  sentenced to forty-one  months in prison  and McHugh was\n\nsentenced to a year and a day in prison.\n\n          On  appeal,  McHugh and  Brennan  raise  a host  of\n\nchallenges to the trial proceedings.  Their complaints can be\n\nloosely  divided   into  two  categories:     (1)  there  was\n\ninsufficient   evidence   to   support   certain   of   their\n\nconvictions, and (2) a number of decisions of the trial judge\n\nregarding the  parameters of the trial,  the admissibility of\n\ncertain   disputed  evidence,   and  the   jury  instructions\n\nconstituted   reversible  error.     Brennan   also  advances\n\nmiscellaneous   arguments   that   he   was   victimized   by\n\nconstitutionally  infirm  legal representation  at  trial and\n\nthat his  sentence was  unlawful.  After  carefully reviewing\n\nthe   voluminous   record  in   the   light   of  appellants'\n\ncontentions, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                         BACKGROUND2\n                                   \n\n          Because attempting  to recount the evidence in this\n\ncase would  be both unnecessary and  inherently Sisyphean, we\n\n                    \n\n1.  McHugh's  motion, which  sought  acquittal on  all counts\ncharged, was otherwise denied.\n\n2.  As  is always the case when we consider whether there was\nsufficient evidence  to support  a conviction, we  review the\nevidence in the  light most favorable  to the government  and\nresolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  See,\n                                                            \ne.g., United  States v. Guzman-Rivera, No.  92-1855, slip op.\n                                     \nat 6 (1st Cir. April 9, 1993).\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ncut to the heart of the matter.   McHugh was hired by CSB  on\n\nMay  24, 1987,  as a  senior  vice-president and  senior loan\n\nofficer  in charge  of commercial  lending.   At the  time of\n\nMcHugh's  hiring,  CSB  had  a  relatively  small  commercial\n\nlending department.   Among other things,  McHugh was charged\n\nwith increasing the volume of commercial loans.  To that end,\n\nCSB's Board of Investment  (\"the Board\") provided McHugh with\n\na personal lending authority of up to  $500,000 per borrower.\n\nCommercial loans in excess of $500,000 to any single borrower\n\ncould not, however, be made without prior Board approval.\n\n          On  June  5,  1987,  Brennan met  with  McHugh  and\n\nrequested a $70,000 unsecured loan  from CSB.3  In connection\n\nwith the  requested loan, Brennan provided CSB  with a signed\n\nPersonal Financial  Statement (\"PFS\").   The PFS  contained a\n\npreamble indicating  that the borrower would  notify the bank\n\nof material changes in his/her financial condition.  Evidence\n\nintroduced at trial revealed  that Brennan made statements on\n\nhis PFS pertaining to his income, real estate holdings, notes\n\npayable to others, and contingent liabilities that were false\n\nboth at the time they were submitted and throughout Brennan's\n\nrelationship  with CSB.   McHugh  approved the  loan and,  in\n\naccordance with  the agreed upon procedures,  presented it to\n\nthe Board.   The Board subsequently signed off on it.  On the\n\n                    \n\n3.  McHugh and Brennan had a prior business relationship when\nMcHugh was a senior lender at First Mutual Bank.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nterm  sheet  which was  required for  each loan  made, McHugh\n\nnoted that the purpose  of the $70,000 loan was  \"[t]o assist\n\nin  the purchase of stock  in Harbor Group,  Inc.\"4  Evidence\n\nsuggested,  however,  that Brennan  used  the  loan to  cover\n\noverdrafts he had written at the Yankee Bank.\n\n          So  began  a   relationship  that,  throughout  the\n\nremainder of 1987,  led to the  extension of nine  additional\n\nloans by  McHugh to Brennan, persons  closely affiliated with\n\nBrennan, or Brennan-controlled entities.  The dates, amounts,\n\nand persons/entities  who received these  subsequent loans we\n\nsummarize as follows:\n\n     1.   A  July   17,  1987,   loan  to  Brennan   for\n     approximately $250,000;\n     2.   A  July   20,  1987,   loan  to   Brennan  for\n     approximately $100,000;\n     3.   An  August  3,  1987,   loan  to  Brennan  for\n     approximately $500,000;\n     4.   An August 11, 1987, loan to JoAnn Brennan, the\n     defendant's wife, for approximately $332,000;\n     5.   A September 1, 1987,  loan to Charles White, a\n     friend of Brennan, for approximately $400,000;5\n     6.   A September 2, 1987, loan to Joseph Hoffman, a\n     business  associate  of Brennan,  for approximately\n     $500,000;6\n     7.   A September 22, 1987, loan to the Harbor Group\n     for approximately $500,000;\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  Harbor  Group   was  a  Brennan-controlled   company\norganized primarily to acquire and sell other companies. \n\n5.  Although White was the  nominal borrower of the $400,000,\nthe evidence reveals that the money was wired by CSB directly\nto an account maintained by Brennan at the Shore Bank. \n\n6.  Again, although  Hoffman was the nominal  borrower of the\n$500,000,  the  evidence  shows  that  the  money  was  wired\ndirectly by CSB to Brennan's account at the Shore Bank.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n     8.   An October 30, 1987,  loan to the Harbor Group\n     for approximately $550,000; and\n     9.   A  December  31,  1987,  loan  to Brennan  for\n     approximately $225,000.\n\n          Evidence at  trial revealed  that Brennan  used the\n\nproceeds of many of these loans to pay off debts, both to CSB\n\nand elsewhere, rather than  for the purposes recorded  on the\n\nrelevant  term sheets.  The evidence also indicated or tended\n\nto  indicate  (1) that  many  of  Brennan's repayment  checks\n\nbounced but were redeposited  at McHugh's direction; (2) that\n\nMcHugh  did not  bring these  loans and  their interconnected\n\nnature  to the attention of either the Board or James Keegan,\n\nCSB's president;  (3) that  McHugh took affirmative  steps to\n\nconceal from  others at the bank  Brennan's problems repaying\n\nthe  loans; (4)  that McHugh  exceeded his loan  authority in\n\nmaking  some  of  these  loans;  (5)  that  McHugh  made  and\n\nstructured some  of these  loans in order  to circumvent  his\n\nlending authority, and  so that  he would not  have to  bring\n\nthem to the Board's attention; (6) that no loan  file or term\n\nsheet  was created for the  JoAnn Brennan loan;  (7) that the\n\nloans  to JoAnn  Brennan  and Charles  White  were made  with\n\nlittle  or no inquiry into or knowledge of the named debtors'\n\nactual  abilities  to  repay   the  loans;  (8)  that  McHugh\n\nknowingly  caused false  purposes for  the White  and Hoffman\n\nloans to be  recorded on  their respective  term sheets;  (9)\n\nthat  McHugh was aware that JoAnn Brennan, White, and Hoffman\n\nexpected  James Brennan to repay the loans taken out in their\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nnames; (10) that the $550,000 loan to the Harbor Group, which\n\nwas guaranteed by Brennan, was made to disguise the fact that\n\ncertain  loans to  Brennan  and Brennan-controlled  interests\n\nwere delinquent; (11)  that, with regard  to the White  loan,\n\nMcHugh directed that Brennan funds be used to make an overdue\n\ninterest payment;  and (12) that,  with regard  to the  White\n\nloan,  Brennan  furnished  CSB  with a  PFS,  purportedly  on\n\nWhite's behalf, which was riddled with false statements.\n\n           During  the first  week in  March of  1988, Keegan\n\nbecame aware that many of the  aforementioned loans were both\n\ninterconnected and delinquent, ordered internal  and external\n\naudits, and  instructed McHugh to  send letters to  the named\n\nborrowers demanding payment.   McHugh was terminated on March\n\n11, 1988.  The financial loss to CSB exceeded $2,200,000.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\n                               \n\n          McHugh argues that  there was insufficient evidence\n\nto support any  of his  convictions.   Brennan contends  that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to support his convictions on\n\nthe counts charging conspiracy and making false statements to\n\na  lending  institution.7    As  we  have  noted,  after  the\n\n                    \n\n7.  In his  reply brief, Brennan  also expresses a  desire to\njoin  in McHugh's arguments  \"relative to  misapplication and\nmultiplicity.\"   However, it is  well settled  that \"a  legal\nargument  made for  the first  time  in an  appellant's reply\nbrief comes too  late and  need not be  addressed.\"   Rivera-\n                                                             \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nconclusion  of  the  trial,   the  district  court  issued  a\n\ncomprehensive, twenty-seven page memorandum and  order which,\n\namong other things,  responded to these very  arguments.  The\n\nmemorandum and order surveyed  authority pertinent to each of\n\nthe  defendants' arguments,  reviewed  the  evidence  in  the\n\nmanner  mandated  by  the appropriate  legal  standard,8  and\n\nclearly  articulated both  its  conclusions  and its  reasons\n\ntherefor.  We have carefully reviewed the  record and, having\n\nemployed a standard of  review which mirrors that applied  by\n\nthe district court to defendants' motions for acquittal, see,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., United States  v. St. Michael's Credit Union,  880 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n579, 584 (1st  Cir. 1989)  (\"[T]he standard of  review for  a\n\njudgment   of  acquittal   notwithstanding  the   verdict  is\n\nidentical to the test employed  to measure the sufficiency of\n\nevidence   supporting  a   guilty  verdict.\")   (brackets  in\n\noriginal) (quoting  McNatt, 813 F.2d at  502), find ourselves\n                          \n\nin  complete agreement  with the  conclusions reached  by the\n\n                    \n\nMuriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 354 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                         \nAccordingly,  Brennan has waived the aforementioned arguments\non appeal.\n\n8.  Quoting  United States v. McNatt,  813 F.2d 499, 502 (1st\n                                    \nCir. 1987),  the district court correctly  noted the standard\nunder which the defendants'  motions were properly evaluated:\n\"The test is  whether, considering the  evidence as a  whole,\ntaken in the light most favorable to the government, together\nwith all legitimate  inferences that  can be drawn  from such\nevidence, a rational  trier of  fact could  have found  guilt\nbeyond a  reasonable doubt.\"   United States v.  Brennan, Cr.\n                                                        \nNo.  90-10235-WF, slip  op.  at 3  (D.  Mass.

We therefore  reject defendants' sufficiency\n\nchallenges substantially on the basis of the district court's\n\nopinion.  We pause to address only one issue.\n\n          In  arguing that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport his  convictions for  willful misapplication of  bank\n\nfunds9  arising out of the October 30, 1987, $550,000 loan to\n\nthe Harbor Group  and the loans  extended to White,  Hoffman,\n\nand JoAnn Brennan, McHugh  contends that our previous opinion\n\nin  Gens, see supra  note 9, mandates a  ruling in his favor.\n                   \n\nAfter careful consideration, we do not agree.\n\n          In  Gens, several  bank officers were  convicted of\n                  \n\nwillful  misapplication under  18 U.S.C.    65610  for making\n\n                    \n\n9.  As one commentator  has noted, \"[W]illful  misapplication\nis a  term that  carries no  technical  or precisely  limited\nmeaning.\"   John K.  Villa, Banking Crimes,    3.02[3][c][ii]\n                                          \n(1992); see also  United States  v.

It is established in this circuit, however,\nthat \"the sine  qua non of charges of  willful misapplication\n                       \nof bank funds is action taken with the knowledge of harm  to,\nintent  to harm,  or  reckless disregard  for, the  financial\nhealth  of the bank.\"  United States  v.

Cyr, 712 F.2d 729, 732 (1st Cir. 1983) (\"[A]\n                    \nreckless disregard by a bank  official of his bank's interest\nis sufficient to establish the requisite intent to defraud.\")\n(quoting United States v. Larson, 581 F.2d 664, 667 (7th Cir.\n                                \n1980)).   The  probability that  the  debtor will  repay  the\nmisapplied  funds is not legally  significant.

This  authority formed  the  foundation  for  the\ndistrict   court's   jury   instructions   on   the   willful\nmisapplication counts.\n\n10.  In relevant part, 18 U.S.C.   656 provides:\n\n       Whoever,  being an  officer,  director, agent  or\n     employee of, or connected  in any capacity with any\n     .  . . insured bank, . . . willfully misapplies any\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nloans to  certain individuals  while aware that  the proceeds\n\nwould  be turned  over  to a  borrower  who, because  he  had\n\nreached the  bank's lending  limit, could  not be  loaned any\n\nmore  money.  In surveying  the indictment and  charge to the\n\njury in that case, we first determined that the jury had been\n\ninstructed to find defendants guilty \"if it  . . . found that\n\n[defendants] granted  the loans to the  named debtors knowing\n\nthat  the proceeds would  be turned  over to  [the off-limits\n\nborrower].\"  Id. at  221.  We then reversed  the convictions,\n                \n\nnoting  that \"such a finding  by itself is  not sufficient to\n                                       \n\nconstitute  willful  misapplication   under     656.\"     Id.\n                                                             \n\n(Emphasis  supplied).  In so doing, we made clear that \"where\n\nthe  named  debtor  is  both financially  capable  and  fully\n\nunderstands that it is his responsibility to repay, a loan to\n\nhim  cannot  -- absent  other  circumstances  -- properly  be\n                                            \n\ncharacterized as sham or  dummy [and therefore illegal], even\n\nif bank officials  know he will turn  over the proceeds to  a\n\nthird  party.\"     Id.   at  222.

On  the one count where it was unclear whether the named\ndebtor  understood his  repayment obligation  on the  loan at\nissue, we  reversed the  conviction but  remanded  for a  new\ntrial.   Id. at 223-24.  On all the other counts, because the\n            \nevidence  revealed  that the  loans  at issue  were  to named\ndebtors who  clearly were financially capable  and understood\nthat it was their obligation to repay, we simply reversed the\ndefendants' convictions.  Id. at 223.\n                             \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nAlthough we did not specifically say so, clearly underpinning\n\nour holding  was the  belief that, without  more, a  rational\n\nfactfinder  cannot infer an intent to defraud the bank on the\n\npart  of a  bank  official  who  simply makes  a  loan  to  a\n\nfinancially  capable party who  understands his/her repayment\n\nobligation.  See generally id. at 222-23.     \n                              \n\n     The facts here are  considerably different from those in\n\nGens.  As  we have  stated, there was  evidence from which  a\n    \n\nrational jury could have concluded that JoAnn Brennan, White,\n\nand  Hoffman   did  not  themselves  expect   to  repay  CSB.\n\nMoreover, there was evidence  suggesting that, with regard to\n\nthe JoAnn Brennan and  White loans, McHugh made little  or no\n\neffort to determine the  actual financial capabilities of the\n\nnamed debtors.12   Thus,  with regard  to the  JoAnn Brennan,\n\nWhite, and Hoffman loans, the jury could have  concluded that\n\nthis was not  a situation where, at  the time the  loans were\n\nextended,  McHugh  knew  that  the named  debtors  were  both\n\nfinancially capable and fully understood their obligations to\n                       \n\nrepay the loans.  See id. at 222.\n                         \n\n          More importantly,  this also is a  case where there\n\nwere \"other  circumstances,\" see  id., which serve  to render\n                                     \n\nthe reasoning of  Gens inapposite.   There was evidence  from\n                      \n\n                    \n\n12.  Indeed, there was evidence which tended to indicate that\nWhite,  JoAnn   Brennan,  and  the  Harbor   Group  were  not\n                                                             \nfinancially  capable of repaying the loans on which they were\nthe named debtors.\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nwhich the jury could  have inferred, among other  things, (1)\n\nthat  McHugh knowingly caused false purposes for the loans to\n\nCharles  White and  Joseph Hoffman  to be  recorded on  their\n\nrespective  term sheets;  (2)  that McHugh  failed to  follow\n\ncustomary  bookkeeping procedures  in extending  the  loan to\n\nJoAnn Brennan; (3) that McHugh exceeded his loan authority in\n\nmaking the loan to the Harbor Group; and (4) that the loan to\n\nthe Harbor Group was  made for the purpose of  disguising the\n\nfact that  certain  loans to  Brennan and  Brennan-controlled\n\ninterests were delinquent.  Moreover, there was evidence from\n\nwhich  a jury could  have found that  McHugh structured these\n\nloans so that he would not  have to present them to the Board\n\nfor prior approval.13   In our view, these are  precisely the\n\ntypes  of  circumstances that  could  have  led the  jury  to\n\nconclude that McHugh, in  extending these loans, exhibited \"a\n\nreckless disregard\" of CSB's interests.  See Cyr, 712 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n732;  Fusaro, 708  F.2d at  21.   Accordingly, we  decline to\n            \n\nupset McHugh's convictions on the misapplication counts.14 \n\n                    \n\n13.  Certainly,  it is  reasonable  to infer  from this  that\nMcHugh thought the Board might not approve of these loans.\n\n14.  Relying on a  passage in Gens  where we  took note of  a\n                                  \ncategory  of  cases  in  which the  defendant  officials  had\n\"assured  the  named  debtor,  regardless  of  his  financial\ncapabilities, that they would look for repayment only to  the\nthird party  who actually received the  loan proceeds[,]\" see\n                                                             \nGens, 493 F.2d  at 222,  McHugh also argues  that because  he\n    \nneither  made  this type  of assurance  nor adopted  any such\nassurance  made   by  Brennan   to  a  nominal   debtor,  his\nconvictions  cannot  stand.   The  short  answer to  McHugh's\nargument is that, in  making this statement in Gens,  we were\n                                                   \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nB.  Pretrial and Trial Issues\n                             \n\n          As  we  have stated,  McHugh  and  Brennan raise  a\n\nnumber  of challenges  to decisions  the district  court made\n\nregarding the  parameters of the trial,  the admissibility of\n\ncertain evidence, and the jury instructions.  We discuss each\n\nargument in turn.\n\n     1.  Severance\n                  \n\n          McHugh  contends that the  district court committed\n\nreversible error in denying  his motion for severance.   More\n\nparticularly, McHugh asserts (1) that the number of counts in\n\nthe indictment created  jury confusion; (2) that there  was a\n\nprejudicial spillover of  evidence, particularly \"Rule 404(b)\n\nevidence,\"15 that  was admitted  solely against  Brennan; and\n\n                    \n\nnot   setting  forth   the   elements  of   the  offense   of\nmisapplication.  Instead, we were summarizing those instances\nwhere  bank  officials  had  been  found  guilty  of  willful\nmisapplication for making loans while aware that the proceeds\nwould be passed along to third parties.  See generally id. at\n                                                          \n221-22.  \n     Moreover, despite McHugh's assertion to the contrary,  a\ncareful reading  of the charge  reveals that the  trial judge\ndid not instruct  the jury that  the existence of one  of the\ntwo aforementioned types of assurances was  an element of the\ncrime of  willful misapplication.   Rather, the  court merely\ninformed the  jury that if  there had  been one of  these two\ntypes of  assurances, \"misapplication  may be found.\"   Thus,\neven if, as McHugh suggests, there was no evidence tending to\nindicate  either that he  assured the  named debtors  that he\nwould  look  only to  Brennan for  repayment  or that  he had\nadopted  such an  assurance made  by Brennan, the  absence of\nthis type of  evidence would  not mandate a  reversal of  his\nconvictions.\n\n15.  Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) provides:\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n(3)  that  the defendants  were  asserting  such inconsistent\n\ndefenses that severance was warranted.  We do not agree.\n\n          A  trial court  will grant  severance \"only  upon a\n\nstrong showing of prejudice.\"  E.g., United States v. Tejeda,\n                                                            \n\n974 F.2d 210, 219 (1st Cir. 1992).  A district court's denial\n\nof  a motion for relief from prejudicial joinder, see Fed. R.\n                                                     \n\nCrim. P. 14,16 is  reviewed only for an abuse  of discretion,\n\ne.g., United States v. Tracy, No. 92-1459, slip op. at 8 (1st\n                            \n\nCir.), cert.  denied     U.S.     , 61 U.S.L.W.  3773 (1993),\n                    \n\nand we will  reverse only  if the  district court's  decision\n\n\"`deprived  defendant  of  a   fair  trial,  resulting  in  a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.'\"   Tejeda, 974 F.2d  at 219 (quoting\n                                  \n\nUnited  States v.  McLaughlin,  957  F.2d  12, 18  (1st  Cir.\n                             \n\n1992)).\n\n                    \n\n          Other crimes, wrongs,  or acts.   Evidence  of\n          Other crimes, wrongs,  or acts.   \n     other crimes, wrongs, or  acts is not admissible to\n     prove the  character of a  person in order  to show\n     action in  conformity therewith.  It  may, however,\n     be admissible for other  purposes, such as proof of\n     motive,  opportunity,  intent,  preparation,  plan,\n     knowledge,  identity,  or  absence  of  mistake  or\n     accident,  provided  that   upon  request  by   the\n     accused, the prosecution in  a criminal case  shall\n     provide  reasonable notice in  advance of trial, or\n     during trial  if the court excuses  pretrial notice\n     on good cause  shown, of the general  nature of any\n     such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.\n\n16.  In relevant part,  Fed. R.  Crim P. 14  states:  \"If  it\nappears that  a defendant . . . is prejudiced by a joinder of\noffenses or of defendants in  an indictment . . ., the  court\nmay order an election  or separate trials of counts,  grant a\nseverance  of defendants  or  provide whatever  other  relief\njustice requires. . . .\"\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          Briefly  stated,  we  can  perceive   no  abuse  of\n\ndiscretion  resulting  in  a  miscarriage  of  justice  here.\n\nAlthough this was a complicated  case, McHugh has provided us\n\nwith  absolutely no  basis for concluding  that the  jury was\n\nconfused.  Rather, the  discriminating verdict suggests to us\n\nthat   the  jury  was  fully  able   to  follow  the  court's\n\ninstructions  and  differentiate   between  the  counts   and\n\ndefendants.  See United  States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d  230, 246\n                                         \n\n(1st  Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849 (1990).  Moreover, we\n                         \n\nare  persuaded   that  the  district   court's  vigilant  and\n\npersistent use of limiting instructions throughout the trial,\n\nwhen  taken with  its final  charge instructing  the jury  to\n\nconsider the defendants and the counts separately, adequately\n\nprotected  McHugh from  the possible  effects of  prejudicial\n\nspillover.   See Tejeda, 974 F.2d at  219.17  Finally, to the\n                       \n\n                    \n\n17.  With  regard   to  each  of  the   examples  (i.e.,  the\n                                                       \npromissory notes to Gloria  Campobasso and the Hokal Anstalt,\nthe complaint filed by Judith  Eissner, and the testimony  of\nKenneth  D'Amato regarding  two  conversations  with  Brennan\nwherein Brennan  stated that McHugh would someday wake up and\nfind  a new  car  in his  driveway)  McHugh cites  where  the\ndistrict court did not deliver a limiting instruction despite\nMcHugh's request  for one, we  note that  the district  court\nexplicitly denied McHugh's request  because, in its view, the\nevidence was probative on the question of whether there was a\nconspiracy  between McHugh  and Brennan.   On  appeal, McHugh\ndoes   not  challenge   the  correctness   of  this   ruling.\nAccordingly,   this  evidence,  far  from  being  prejudicial\nbecause  of  its  potential  for  \"spilling  over,\"  must  be\nconstrued as evidence properly admitted against McHugh on the\nconspiracy count.\n     With  regard  to  the  evidence  admitted  only  against\nBrennan  but referred  to by  the  Government in  its closing\nargument  against McHugh, we simply  note that McHugh did not\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nextent that McHugh raised any defenses that were inconsistent\n\nwith  the   ones  presented   by  Brennan,  McHugh   has  not\n\narticulated, nor can we discern, how the inconsistencies were\n\n\"so prejudicial  and the defenses so  irreconcilable that the\n\njury unjustifiably . . .  infer[red] that this conflict alone\n\ndemonstrates that both are guilty.\"  United States v. Luciano\n                                                             \n\nPacheco, 794 F.2d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1986) (quoting United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Bautista, 731 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir. 1984)).  Accordingly,\n           \n\nwe  find that the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin refusing to grant McHugh's severance motion.\n\n     2.   Evidence Relating to Brennan's  Dealings with Other\n                                                             \n     Banks and Persons\n                      \n\n          Brennan  generally argues that  \"the Government was\n\npermitted to  introduce excessive evidence  relating to other\n\ntransactions that were not  a basis for the indictment.\"   He\n\ngoes  on, however,  to specify  only  three examples  of such\n\n\"excessive\" evidence:  (1) the testimony of Gloria Campobasso\n\nregarding an  outstanding promissory  note Brennan  had given\n\n                    \n\nobject to  the Government's  line of  argument at  that time.\nAccordingly, we review only  for plain error.   United States\n                                                             \nv.  Gonzales-Torres, 980 F.2d 788,  791 (1st Cir.  1992).  To\n                   \nestablish plain error, McHugh must demonstrate that the error\ncomplained  of is so compelling  that he virtually is assured\nof  succeeding in his appeal, and that the error affected the\nfundamental fairness  and basic integrity of  the proceedings\nin the  lower court.  See  id.; see also Boylan,  898 F.2d at\n                                               \n249 (\"The  [plain error] doctrine does not allow litigants to\nbe relieved from the `ordinary backfires  . . . which may mar\na  trial record.'\")  (quoting United  States v.  Griffin, 818\n                                                        \nF.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844 (1987)). \n                                     \nWe find that the  incident at issue, if erroneous,  falls far\nshort of the plain error threshold.   \n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nher,  (2)  the  testimony  of  Donald  Moscone  regarding  an\n\noutstanding promissory  note Brennan  had given him,  and (3)\n\nthe testimony of K.  Dun Gifford regarding a certain  loan he\n\nhad taken out at the First American Bank on Brennan's behalf.\n\nAt trial, Brennan neither objected to the introduction of any\n\nof  this evidence nor did he  request a limiting instruction.\n\nThus, the admission of this evidence can serve as a basis for\n\nreversal  only  if plainly  erroneous.   Gonzales-Torres, 980\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 791.  After carefully reviewing the entire record, we\n\ndiscern no plain error  in the district court's  admission of\n\nthis evidence.  Accordingly, we reject Brennan's argument for\n\nreversal on this ground.18 \n\n     3.  Gifford's Testimony Characterizing Brennan's Actions\n                                                             \n     Towards Him as \"Illegal, Unlawful and Fraudulent\"\n                                                      \n\n          Brennan's  next argument,  that  K.  Dun  Gifford's\n\ntestimony  that Brennan's  dealings with  him  were \"illegal,\n\nunlawful and  fraudulent\" prejudiced  him, suffers  a similar\n\n                    \n\n18.  Without  elaborating,   McHugh  also  states   that  the\nadmission  of the above-referenced  evidence without limiting\ninstructions \"was  highly prejudicial\"  to him.   However, he\nneither identifies a specific instance where he was  denied a\nlimiting   instruction  nor  attempts   to  explain  why  the\nadmission   of  this   evidence   was   highly   prejudicial.\nAccordingly, we view McHugh's  \"argument,\" to the extent that\nit can be  so characterized, as waived.   See, e.g., Cohen v.\n                                                          \nBrown Univ.,  No. 92-2483, slip op. at 30 (1st Cir. April 16,\n           \n1993)  (\"Litigants cannot  preserve  an issue  for appeal  by\nraising a pennant  and then moving on  to another subject.\");\nRyan  v. Royal Ins.

Even if we construe the admission of this statement as\n\nerroneous,  Brennan's failure to object to it at trial limits\n\nour review to the now-familiar plain error rubric.  Id.  Once\n                                                       \n\nagain,  our review  persuades  us that  the district  court's\n\nadmission of this evidence did not rise to the level of plain\n\nerror.  Accordingly, we decline to reverse on this ground.\n\n     4.  Prosecutorial Misconduct    \n     4.  Prosecutorial Misconduct\n                                 \n\n          Brennan   makes   two   separate   arguments   that\n\nprosecutorial   misconduct  requires   a   reversal  of   his\n\nconviction.   He first claims  that he is  entitled to a  new\n\ntrial  because the prosecutor asked him on cross-examination,\n\nwithout a good faith  basis for the question, whether  he was\n\nterminated from prior employment  as a stockbroker at Tucker,\n\nAnthony, and Day.   The record reveals,  however, that George\n\nDowney  and  Brian  O'Rourke,  who were  interviewed  by  the\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation prior to trial, stated to the\n\ninterviewing agents that Brennan had been terminated from his\n\nemployment at  Tucker,  Anthony,  and  Day  for  unauthorized\n\ntrading.    Brennan has  not presented  us with  any evidence\n\nsuggesting that  the Government  knew, or should  have known,\n\nthat these statements  were false.  Accordingly,  there is no\n\nreason  for us to conclude that the question posed to Brennan\n\non cross-examination was not asked in good faith.19  \n\n                    \n\n19.  Brennan  also  argues,  in  a paragraph  that  can  most\ncharitably  be   described  as  cryptic,  that   one  of  the\nGovernment  prosecutors made  false  representations  to  the\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\n          Second,  Brennan contends that the Government acted\n\nimproperly  in  putting  into   issue,  both  in  its  cross-\n\nexamination of Brennan and in its rebuttal argument, the fact\n\nthat  Brennan did  not  introduce into  evidence any  records\n\ncorroborating certain aspects of his testimony.  In Brennan's\n\nview,  such actions  apparently were  tantamount to  making a\n\ncomment on  Brennan's failure to testify  and thereby shifted\n\nthe burden of proof  from the Government to Brennan.   Again,\n\nwe do not agree.\n\n          Without question, clearly it is impermissible for a\n\nprosecutor to comment, either  directly or by implication, on\n\na  defendant's failure  to  take the  stand  during a  trial.\n\nGriffin v. California,  380 U.S. 609,  615 (1965).   However,\n                     \n\nwhen a defendant does take the stand, a prosecutor may attack\n\n                    \n\ndistrict  court at  the sidebar  conference during  which the\ncourt addressed whether the Government could inquire into the\ncircumstances  surrounding  Brennan's departure  from Tucker,\nAnthony,  and Day.  In so doing, however, Brennan relies upon\nan affidavit which  is not part of the record  before us, has\nnot  been made  part  of any  appendix  (as no  appendix  was\nsubmitted by appellants), and was not included in his inutile\naddendum.  Accordingly, we do not address this argument.  See\n                                                             \nCommonwealth  of  Massachusetts,  Dep't. of  Pub.

One Motor Yacht\n                                                             \nNamed  Mercury,  527  F.2d   1112,  1113  (1st  Cir.  1975)).\n              \nFurthermore, we  admonish Brennan's appellate counsel for his\nlack  of professionalism  in characterizing  the Government's\nprosecutor's   statements   as  \"false,\"   \"fictitious,\"  and\n\"unconscionable\" without  providing us with  even a scintilla\nof evidence to support his allegations.     \n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nas weak  the evidentiary foundation upon  which a defendant's\n\ntestimony  rests.  See United States v. Garcia, 818 F.2d 136,\n                                              \n\n143-44 (1st Cir.  1987); United States v.  Savarese, 649 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n83,  87 (1st Cir. 1981).   Moreover, we  previously have held\n\nthat a  prosecutor's comments regarding a defendant's failure\n\nto  produce  documents  corroborating a  defense  theory  are\n\nproper  if  they are  limited  to assailing  the  strength or\n\nplausibility of the proffered theory.   See United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nGlantz, 810  F.2d 316, 321-22  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 482\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 929 (1987).\n\n          Having reviewed the questions and comments at issue\n\nhere,20 we are persuaded  that they were made solely  for the\n\npurpose   of  calling   into   question   the  strength   and\n\nplausibility of certain of Brennan's testimony.  Moreover, we\n\n                    \n\n20.  On  direct,  Brennan   testified  about   a  number   of\ntransactions  and  facts  that   normally  would  have   been\nmemorialized  in  writing  during  the  ordinary   course  of\nbusiness dealings.  On cross-examination,  after ascertaining\nthat Brennan  had reviewed the records  of these transactions\nand facts prior to trial, the Government asked Brennan:  \"And\nsome of  those documents,  I imagine, would  corroborate what\nyou  have been saying on the stand  for the last two days, is\nthat right?\"  Later, in its rebuttal argument, the Government\nmade the following comment:\n\n          Then you  have the suggestion  that you should\n     take Mr. Brennan at his  word that he had  $700,000\n     in  the bank.    Well,  first  of all,  ladies  and\n     gentlemen, I suggest that  you have no reason based\n     on his  testimony, based  on the evidence,  to take\n     him at his word.  \n          You may ask yourselves the question:  Where is\n     the bank  statement?  Where is  the thing produced?\n     Who corroborates his testimony? \n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nare  convinced that the jury could not have drawn an improper\n\ninference  from  them.    Accordingly,  we  reject  Brennan's\n\nrequest for  a new trial  insofar as  it is based  upon these\n\nquestions and comments.\n\n     5.  Deposition Testimony of Non-Testifying Codefendant\n                                                           \n\n          Brennan  also  argues  that  the  district  court's\n\nadmission   against   him,   pursuant  to   Fed.   R.   Evid.\n\n801(d)(2),21  of  certain deposition  testimony given  by the\n\nnon-testifying McHugh  during the course  of a civil  case in\n\n1989 entitles him to  a new trial.22  In  Brennan's view, the\n\nadmission of  this material infringed on  his Sixth Amendment\n\nright  to conduct  adequate cross-examination  of  an adverse\n\nwitness  and resulted in reversible  error.  We  do not share\n\nBrennan's belief that reversible error was committed.\n\n          As an  initial matter,  we agree with  Brennan that\n\nbecause  the  disputed  deposition  testimony  was not  given\n\n\"during the course and in furtherance of  the conspiracy,\" it\n\nwas  not admissible  under Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).   See\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n21.  Although  it did not so specify, it is apparent that the\ncourt   admitted  the   statement  as   \"a  statement   by  a\ncoconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance\nof the conspiracy.\"  See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).\n                        \n\n22.  During  McHugh's  cross-examination of  Brennan, Brennan\nrepresented that, at  the time  he had requested  two of  the\nloans  applied  for at  CSB, he  told  McHugh the  reasons he\nneeded the  loans.  In  response, the Government,  during its\ncross-examination   of   Brennan,   successfully  sought   to\nintroduce  the prior testimony of McHugh that he did not know\nthe  purposes of  the  loans at  issue  at the  time  Brennan\napplied for them. \n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\nUnited  States  v. Carper,  942  F.2d 1298,  1301  (8th Cir.)\n                         \n\n(statement made to officer  after arrest of coconspirator not\n\nadmissible under  Fed. R.

Ct.  614  (1991).   However,  even if  we\n\nconstrue  the admission  of the  statement as  erroneous, our\n\nreview of the entire  record persuades us that the  error was\n\nharmless  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.23    See  Chapman  v.\n                                                         \n\nCalifornia, 386  U.S. 18,  22-24 (1967); Manocchio  v.

Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E) held to be harmless error).  \n\n          Simply put, we do not believe, as Brennan contends,\n\nthat  McHugh's testimony  tended to  prove that  \"Brennan was\n\nfabricating the purposes of  the loans.\"  McHugh's deposition\n\ntestimony  was  that  McHugh did  not  know  why Brennan  was\n\nseeking  the loans; it was not that Brennan provided him with\n                              \n\nfalse  purposes  for the  loans.    Thus, the  testimony  had\n\nlittle,  if any,  probative value.   This fact,  when coupled\n\n                    \n\n23.  On  appeal,  the  Government makes  a  somewhat strained\nargument that the material was admissible under Fed. R. Evid.\n806.  Because we find that the admission of this material, if\nerroneous, was harmless  error, we need not reach  the merits\nof the Government's position.\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\nwith the abundance of evidence, completely independent of the\n\nmaterial  here  at  issue,   to  support  each  of  Brennan's\n\nconvictions, convinces us beyond  a reasonable doubt that the\n\njury  \"would have  reached  the same  verdict without  having\n\nreceived the tainted evidence.\"  Clark v. Moran, 942 F.2d 24,\n                                               \n\n27 (1st  Cir. 1991) (quoting  Milton v.

Accordingly,  we\n\ndecline  Brennan's request for a  new trial insofar  as it is\n\npremised on  the allegedly erroneous admission  of the McHugh\n\ndeposition testimony.\n\n     6.  Jury Instructions\n                          \n\n          McHugh   contends  that,  in  three  respects,  the\n\ndistrict  court  committed  reversible  error  in  its   jury\n\ninstructions.  After carefully  reviewing the record in light\n\nof McHugh's arguments, we do not agree.\n\n     a.  Ratification of Board as a Defense\n                                           \n\n          McHugh argues  that the court erred  in refusing to\n\ninstruct the jury that  ratification by the Board constitutes\n\na complete defense  to willful misapplication.   In so doing,\n\nMcHugh refers  us to  several cases which,  without analysis,\n\nsimply state that  valid consent or ratification by the Board\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nof  Directors  is a  defense to  a charge  of misapplication.\n\nSee,  e.g., United States v. Gregory, 730 F.2d 692, 701 (11th\n                                    \n\nCir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1208 (1985); United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

Castro,\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n24.  Of course,  there may be peculiar  circumstances where a\nfinding of ratification  by the Board  would, per se,  compel\n                                                    \nthe defendant's  acquittal.  If,  for example, the  charge of\nwillful  misapplication were  premised entirely  upon  a bank\nofficer's non-disclosure of  a loan to  the Board, clearly  a\njury  could not convict that officer  of misapplication if it\nfound that s/he had  presented the loan to the  Board and the\nBoard had ratified it. \n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\n887 F.2d 988, 995 (9th Cir. 1989).  We are  in full agreement\n\nwith the rule established by these courts.\n\n          In our view, the correctness of this recent line of\n\nauthority is best demonstrated by a brief explication of  the\n\npractical effects of its negation.   If we were to adopt  the\n\nabsolute rule  proposed by McHugh and  hold that ratification\n\nby a Board of Directors per se exonerates a bank officer from\n                              \n\ncharges  of  willful  misapplication,  then   we  would,  for\n\nexample, put beyond the reach of   656 a bank officer who, in\n\ncollusion  with  a rogue  Board,  provides bank  funds  to an\n\notherwise  unqualified  personal friend.    We simply  cannot\n\ndiscern  any  rational  justification  for  reaching  such  a\n\nresult.\n\n          In the instant matter,  the district court declined\n\nto instruct the  jury that, as a matter of  law, it could not\n\nconvict  McHugh of misapplication if  it found that the Board\n\nhad  ratified the loans at issue.  Instead, the court allowed\n\nMcHugh  to introduce  evidence of  ratification and  to argue\n\nthat this evidence  suggested that  McHugh had  no intent  to\n\ninjure  or defraud CSB.   We believe that,  in this case, the\n\ncourt's actions  were entirely appropriate.   Accordingly, we\n\nreject McHugh's claim of reversible error.\n\n     b.  Reference to False Entries in Overt Act Instructions\n                                                             \n\n          McHugh  next  contends  that because  the  district\n\ncourt entered  a judgment  of  acquittal notwithstanding  the\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\nverdict  for  McHugh  on  the  false  entry  counts,  it  was\n\nreversible  error for it to have allowed the jury to consider\n\nthe incident underlying one of the false entries counts as an\n\novert  act  in its  conspiracy  instruction.   The  error, in\n\nMcHugh's view, arises from  the fact that \"the jury  may have\n\nfound [McHugh] guilty of conspiracy solely on the basis of an\n\nalleged act which  was not  criminal.\"  However,  it is  well\n\nestablished that  an overt act need not be a crime.

Medina, 761  F.2d 12, 15  (1st Cir.  1985).\n                        \n\nAccordingly,  McHugh's  argument, limited  as  it  is to  the\n\nstatement  quoted   above,  fails   as  a  matter   of  well-\n\nestablished law.\n\n     c.  Loan Authority Instruction\n                                   \n\n          McHugh  also takes issue  with the district court's\n\nhaving  instructed the jury:   \"In  addition, with  regard to\n\nthese charges, you may  also consider the evidence concerning\n\nMr.  McHugh's loan  authority and  question whether  he acted\n\nwith  intent to  injure [the  CSB]  in his  dealings with Mr.\n\nBrennan.\"    It is  McHugh's  opinion  that this  instruction\n\nimproperly \"focused  the attention of the  jury on resolution\n\nof one  evidentiary issue as especially  significant in their\n\n[sic] deliberations [concerning]  whether [McHugh] acted with\n\nintent to injure  and defraud.\"   Our review  of the  record,\n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\nhowever, persuades  us that this instruction,  far from being\n\nfaulty,  was an  altogether proper  exercise by  the district\n\njudge of his  authority to \"assist the jury in  arriving at a\n\njust   conclusion  by  explaining  and  commenting  upon  the\n\nevidence, [and] by drawing their [sic] attention to the parts\n\nof it  which  he  thinks  important[.]\"   Querica  v.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 289  U.S. 466,  469 (1933).   Accordingly, we  reject\n      \n\nMcHugh's characterization of this instruction as erroneous.\n\nC.  Miscellany\n              \n\n          Brennan raises  three final arguments.   First,  he\n\nasserts that  his representation  at trial and  at sentencing\n\nwas constitutionally  deficient.  Next, he  contends that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in sentencing him to the\n\nhigh  end  of the  relevant  guideline  range.   Finally,  he\n\nmaintains that  the court abused its  discretion in adjusting\n\nhis  sentence upward  for obstruction  of justice.    None of\n\nBrennan's arguments requires extended discussion.\n\n     1.  Ineffective Assistance\n                               \n\n          Brennan claims that his representation at trial and\n\nat  sentencing   was  ineffective  and  violated   his  Sixth\n\nAmendment rights.   In so doing, Brennan  points primarily to\n\nthe failure  of trial counsel to  introduce certain documents\n\ninto evidence and the failure  of sentencing counsel to spend\n\nsufficient  time   preparing  for  the   sentencing  hearing.\n\nHowever, the  appellate record does not  indicate that either\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nof these  claims was properly raised  before and/or addressed\n\nby the  district court.  Moreover, our review  of the  record\n\npersuades us  that the  record is not  sufficiently developed\n\nfor  us to  address the merits  of Brennan's  Sixth Amendment\n\nclaim at this  time. Accordingly, we do  not reach it.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., United States v.  Gray, 958 F.2d 9, 15 (1st  Cir. 1992)\n                            \n\n(\"Time  and again  we have  held that  a claim  of inadequate\n\nrepresentation will not be resolved on direct appeal when the\n\nclaim has not been  raised in the district court,  unless the\n\ncritical  facts  are  not   in  dispute  and  a  sufficiently\n\ndeveloped record exists.\");  see also United States v. Hoyos-\n                                                             \n\nMedina, 878 F.2d  21, 22  (1st Cir. 1989)  (\"Fairness to  the\n      \n\nparties  and  judicial  economy  both  warrant  that,  absent\n\nextraordinary  circumstances,  an  appellate  court  will not\n\nconsider an ineffective  assistance claim  where no  endeavor\n\nwas first made to  determine the claim at the  district court\n\nlevel.\").25 \n\n     2.  Sentence at High End of Guidelines Range\n                                                 \n\n          Brennan  also  contends  that  the  district  court\n\nabused  its discretion in sentencing  him to the  high end of\n\nthe  relevant guideline  range  while  departing downward  in\n\nsentencing McHugh.  The thrust of Brennan's argument is  that\n\nthe disparity between the sentences  of McHugh and himself is\n\n                    \n\n25.  Brennan may, of course, press his ineffective assistance\nclaim in the district court by way of a collateral proceeding\nunder 28 U.S.C.   2255.\n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\nunfair.   Established caselaw,  however, makes clear  that we\n\nhave  no jurisdiction to review a sentence that is within the\n\napplicable guideline  range.   E.g., United States  v. Aubin,\n                                                            \n\n961 F.2d 980,  984 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 113 S.  Ct. 248\n                                            \n\n(1992).  Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of Brennan's\n\nargument.26\n\n     3.  Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice\n                                               \n\n          Finally,  Brennan asserts  that the  district court\n\nabused its  discretion by  enhancing his sentence  two levels\n\nfor   obstruction   of  justice   for   perceived  perjurious\n\ntestimony.  See U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 (\"If the defendant willfully\n               \n\nobstructed or  impeded, or  attempted to obstruct  or impede,\n\nthe  administration  of  justice  during  the  investigation,\n\nprosecution, or  sentencing of the instant  offense, increase\n\nthe  offense level by 2 levels.\") (1991 version).  A district\n                      2 \n\ncourt's application of this guideline provision is reviewable\n\nonly  for  clear  error.   E.g.,  United  States  v. Batista-\n                                                             \n\nPolanco,  927  F.2d  14, 22  (1st  Cir.  1991).   Our  review\n       \n\nconvinces  us   that  the  district  court's  application  of\n\nU.S.S.G.    3C1.1, far from being clearly erroneous, is amply\n\n                    \n\n26.  In his reply brief, Brennan also challenges the district\ncourt's  calculation of loss.  As noted above, see supra note\n                                                        \n7,  arguments made for the first time in an appellant's reply\nbrief are  deemed waived.   See Rivera-Muriente, 959  F.2d at\n                                               \n354.   Thus,  we do  not  address Brennan's  loss calculation\nchallenge.\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\nsupported   by   the  record.27     Accordingly,   we  reject\n\nBrennan's claim that the enhancement at issue was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          Having  rejected  each  of the  arguments  made  on\n\nappeal by Brennan and McHugh, we affirm their convictions and\n\nsentences.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                    \n\n27.  The  district  court  explicitly   found  each  of   the\nfollowing  to be examples  of Brennan's perjurious testimony:\n(1) Brennan's claim that he did not submit a PFS for purposes\nof influencing CSB's decision to provide him with the June 5,\n1987, $70,000 loan; (2)  Brennan's assertion that he expected\nall of his bounced  checks to be honored because  he expected\nthere to be sufficient  funds in the appropriate accounts  at\nthe  time the  checks  were presented  for  payment; and  (3)\nBrennan's statement  that he  did not acknowledge  having any\nnotes  payable to  others  on his  PFS because  of sufficient\n\"offsetting  assets.\"   There  was overwhelming  evidence  to\nsupport each of these findings.\n\n                             -30-\n                              30\n",

On  September 18,  1990, a\n                               \n\nfederal  grand  jury  returned  a  multiple count  indictment\n\nagainst defendant-appellant J. Edward McHugh, a former senior\n\nvice-president  and loan officer of the Cambridgeport Savings\n\nBank  (\"CSB\"), and  defendant-appellant James  F.  Brennan, a\n\nborrower of large  sums of  money from CSB.   The  indictment\n\ncharged  both  defendants with  one  count  of conspiracy  to\n\ncommit  bank  fraud and  to  willfully  misapply bank  funds;\n\nMcHugh  with one count of  bank fraud, six  counts of willful\n\nmisapplication of bank funds, and four counts of making false\n\nentries in  bank  records; and  Brennan  with two  counts  of\n\nmaking false  statements to a lending  institution, one count\n\nof aiding and abetting McHugh's bank fraud, and six counts of\n\naiding and  abetting McHugh's willful misapplication  of bank\n\nfunds.  After a twenty-day trial, a jury returned verdicts of\n\nguilty against both  defendants on  most of the  counts.   It\n\ndid,  however,  acquit  McHugh   on  two  counts  of  willful\n\nmisapplication  and  Brennan  on  one  count  of  aiding  and\n\nabetting a willful misapplication of bank funds.  \n\n          Following  the verdict,  the trial  judge issued  a\n\ncomprehensive, twenty-seven page memorandum and order denying\n\nBrennan's pending motion for acquittal on all counts charged,\n\nbut granting McHugh's pending motion for acquittal insofar as\n\nit related to  the four  counts for making  false entries  in\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nbank records.1   After a two-day  sentencing hearing, Brennan\n\nwas  sentenced to forty-one  months in prison  and McHugh was\n\nsentenced to a year and a day in prison.\n\n          On  appeal,  McHugh and  Brennan  raise  a host  of\n\nchallenges to the trial proceedings.  Their complaints can be\n\nloosely  divided   into  two  categories:     (1)  there  was\n\ninsufficient   evidence   to   support   certain   of   their\n\nconvictions, and (2) a number of decisions of the trial judge\n\nregarding the  parameters of the trial,  the admissibility of\n\ncertain   disputed  evidence,   and  the   jury  instructions\n\nconstituted   reversible  error.     Brennan   also  advances\n\nmiscellaneous   arguments   that   he   was   victimized   by\n\nconstitutionally  infirm  legal representation  at  trial and\n\nthat his  sentence was  unlawful.  After  carefully reviewing\n\nthe   voluminous   record  in   the   light   of  appellants'\n\ncontentions, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                         BACKGROUND2\n                                   \n\n          Because attempting  to recount the evidence in this\n\ncase would  be both unnecessary and  inherently Sisyphean, we\n\n                    \n\n1.  McHugh's  motion, which  sought  acquittal on  all counts\ncharged, was otherwise denied.\n\n2.  As  is always the case when we consider whether there was\nsufficient evidence  to support  a conviction, we  review the\nevidence in the  light most favorable  to the government  and\nresolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  See,\n                                                            \ne.g., United  States v. Guzman-Rivera, No.  92-1855, slip op.\n                                     \nat 6 (1st Cir. April 9, 1993).\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ncut to the heart of the matter.   McHugh was hired by CSB  on\n\nMay  24, 1987,  as a  senior  vice-president and  senior loan\n\nofficer  in charge  of commercial  lending.   At the  time of\n\nMcHugh's  hiring,  CSB  had  a  relatively  small  commercial\n\nlending department.   Among other things,  McHugh was charged\n\nwith increasing the volume of commercial loans.  To that end,\n\nCSB's Board of Investment  (\"the Board\") provided McHugh with\n\na personal lending authority of up to  $500,000 per borrower.\n\nCommercial loans in excess of $500,000 to any single borrower\n\ncould not, however, be made without prior Board approval.\n\n          On  June  5,  1987,  Brennan met  with  McHugh  and\n\nrequested a $70,000 unsecured loan  from CSB.3  In connection\n\nwith the  requested loan, Brennan provided CSB  with a signed\n\nPersonal Financial  Statement (\"PFS\").   The PFS  contained a\n\npreamble indicating  that the borrower would  notify the bank\n\nof material changes in his/her financial condition.  Evidence\n\nintroduced at trial revealed  that Brennan made statements on\n\nhis PFS pertaining to his income, real estate holdings, notes\n\npayable to others, and contingent liabilities that were false\n\nboth at the time they were submitted and throughout Brennan's\n\nrelationship  with CSB.   McHugh  approved the  loan and,  in\n\naccordance with  the agreed upon procedures,  presented it to\n\nthe Board.   The Board subsequently signed off on it.  On the\n\n                    \n\n3.  McHugh and Brennan had a prior business relationship when\nMcHugh was a senior lender at First Mutual Bank.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nterm  sheet  which was  required for  each loan  made, McHugh\n\nnoted that the purpose  of the $70,000 loan was  \"[t]o assist\n\nin  the purchase of stock  in Harbor Group,  Inc.\"4  Evidence\n\nsuggested,  however,  that Brennan  used  the  loan to  cover\n\noverdrafts he had written at the Yankee Bank.\n\n          So  began  a   relationship  that,  throughout  the\n\nremainder of 1987,  led to the  extension of nine  additional\n\nloans by  McHugh to Brennan, persons  closely affiliated with\n\nBrennan, or Brennan-controlled entities.  The dates, amounts,\n\nand persons/entities  who received these  subsequent loans we\n\nsummarize as follows:\n\n     1.   A  July   17,  1987,   loan  to  Brennan   for\n     approximately $250,000;\n     2.   A  July   20,  1987,   loan  to   Brennan  for\n     approximately $100,000;\n     3.   An  August  3,  1987,   loan  to  Brennan  for\n     approximately $500,000;\n     4.   An August 11, 1987, loan to JoAnn Brennan, the\n     defendant's wife, for approximately $332,000;\n     5.   A September 1, 1987,  loan to Charles White, a\n     friend of Brennan, for approximately $400,000;5\n     6.   A September 2, 1987, loan to Joseph Hoffman, a\n     business  associate  of Brennan,  for approximately\n     $500,000;6\n     7.   A September 22, 1987, loan to the Harbor Group\n     for approximately $500,000;\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  Harbor  Group   was  a  Brennan-controlled   company\norganized primarily to acquire and sell other companies. \n\n5.  Although White was the  nominal borrower of the $400,000,\nthe evidence reveals that the money was wired by CSB directly\nto an account maintained by Brennan at the Shore Bank. \n\n6.  Again, although  Hoffman was the nominal  borrower of the\n$500,000,  the  evidence  shows  that  the  money  was  wired\ndirectly by CSB to Brennan's account at the Shore Bank.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n     8.   An October 30, 1987,  loan to the Harbor Group\n     for approximately $550,000; and\n     9.   A  December  31,  1987,  loan  to Brennan  for\n     approximately $225,000.\n\n          Evidence at  trial revealed  that Brennan  used the\n\nproceeds of many of these loans to pay off debts, both to CSB\n\nand elsewhere, rather than  for the purposes recorded  on the\n\nrelevant  term sheets.  The evidence also indicated or tended\n\nto  indicate  (1) that  many  of  Brennan's repayment  checks\n\nbounced but were redeposited  at McHugh's direction; (2) that\n\nMcHugh  did not  bring these  loans and  their interconnected\n\nnature  to the attention of either the Board or James Keegan,\n\nCSB's president;  (3) that  McHugh took affirmative  steps to\n\nconceal from  others at the bank  Brennan's problems repaying\n\nthe  loans; (4)  that McHugh  exceeded his loan  authority in\n\nmaking  some  of  these  loans;  (5)  that  McHugh  made  and\n\nstructured some  of these  loans in order  to circumvent  his\n\nlending authority, and  so that  he would not  have to  bring\n\nthem to the Board's attention; (6) that no loan  file or term\n\nsheet  was created for the  JoAnn Brennan loan;  (7) that the\n\nloans  to JoAnn  Brennan  and Charles  White  were made  with\n\nlittle  or no inquiry into or knowledge of the named debtors'\n\nactual  abilities  to  repay   the  loans;  (8)  that  McHugh\n\nknowingly  caused false  purposes for  the White  and Hoffman\n\nloans to be  recorded on  their respective  term sheets;  (9)\n\nthat  McHugh was aware that JoAnn Brennan, White, and Hoffman\n\nexpected  James Brennan to repay the loans taken out in their\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nnames; (10) that the $550,000 loan to the Harbor Group, which\n\nwas guaranteed by Brennan, was made to disguise the fact that\n\ncertain  loans to  Brennan  and Brennan-controlled  interests\n\nwere delinquent; (11)  that, with regard  to the White  loan,\n\nMcHugh directed that Brennan funds be used to make an overdue\n\ninterest payment;  and (12) that,  with regard  to the  White\n\nloan,  Brennan  furnished  CSB  with a  PFS,  purportedly  on\n\nWhite's behalf, which was riddled with false statements.\n\n           During  the first  week in  March of  1988, Keegan\n\nbecame aware that many of the  aforementioned loans were both\n\ninterconnected and delinquent, ordered internal  and external\n\naudits, and  instructed McHugh to  send letters to  the named\n\nborrowers demanding payment.   McHugh was terminated on March\n\n11, 1988.  The financial loss to CSB exceeded $2,200,000.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\n                               \n\n          McHugh argues that  there was insufficient evidence\n\nto support any  of his  convictions.   Brennan contends  that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to support his convictions on\n\nthe counts charging conspiracy and making false statements to\n\na  lending  institution.7    As  we  have  noted,  after  the\n\n                    \n\n7.  In his  reply brief, Brennan  also expresses a  desire to\njoin  in McHugh's arguments  \"relative to  misapplication and\nmultiplicity.\"   However, it is  well settled  that \"a  legal\nargument  made for  the first  time  in an  appellant's reply\nbrief comes too  late and  need not be  addressed.\"   Rivera-\n                                                             \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nconclusion  of  the  trial,   the  district  court  issued  a\n\ncomprehensive, twenty-seven page memorandum and  order which,\n\namong other things,  responded to these very  arguments.

The  probability that  the  debtor will  repay  the\nmisapplied  funds is not legally  significant.  Cyr, 712 F.2d\n                                                   \nat  732.    This  authority formed  the  foundation  for  the\ndistrict   court's   jury   instructions   on   the   willful\nmisapplication counts.\n\n10.  In relevant part, 18 U.S.C.   656 provides:\n\n       Whoever,  being an  officer,  director, agent  or\n     employee of, or connected  in any capacity with any\n     .  . . insured bank, . . . willfully misapplies any\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nloans to  certain individuals  while aware that  the proceeds\n\nwould  be turned  over  to a  borrower  who, because  he  had\n\nreached the  bank's lending  limit, could  not be  loaned any\n\nmore  money.  In surveying  the indictment and  charge to the\n\njury in that case, we first determined that the jury had been\n\ninstructed to find defendants guilty \"if it  . . . found that\n\n[defendants] granted  the loans to the  named debtors knowing\n\nthat  the proceeds would  be turned  over to  [the off-limits\n\nborrower].\"  Id. at  221.  We then reversed  the convictions,\n                \n\nnoting  that \"such a finding  by itself is  not sufficient to\n                                       \n\nconstitute  willful  misapplication   under     656.\"     Id.\n                                                             \n\n(Emphasis  supplied).

On  the one count where it was unclear whether the named\ndebtor  understood his  repayment obligation  on the  loan at\nissue, we  reversed the  conviction but  remanded  for a  new\ntrial.   Id. at 223-24.  On all the other counts, because the\n            \nevidence  revealed  that the  loans  at issue  were  to named\ndebtors who  clearly were financially capable  and understood\nthat it was their obligation to repay, we simply reversed the\ndefendants' convictions.  Id. at 223.\n                             \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nAlthough we did not specifically say so, clearly underpinning\n\nour holding  was the  belief that, without  more, a  rational\n\nfactfinder  cannot infer an intent to defraud the bank on the\n\npart  of a  bank  official  who  simply makes  a  loan  to  a\n\nfinancially  capable party who  understands his/her repayment\n\nobligation.  See generally id. at 222-23.     \n                              \n\n     The facts here are  considerably different from those in\n\nGens.  As  we have  stated, there was  evidence from which  a\n    \n\nrational jury could have concluded that JoAnn Brennan, White,\n\nand  Hoffman   did  not  themselves  expect   to  repay  CSB.\n\nMoreover, there was evidence  suggesting that, with regard to\n\nthe JoAnn Brennan and  White loans, McHugh made little  or no\n\neffort to determine the  actual financial capabilities of the\n\nnamed debtors.12   Thus,  with regard  to the  JoAnn Brennan,\n\nWhite, and Hoffman loans, the jury could have  concluded that\n\nthis was not  a situation where, at  the time the  loans were\n\nextended,  McHugh  knew  that  the named  debtors  were  both\n\nfinancially capable and fully understood their obligations to\n                       \n\nrepay the loans.  See id. at 222.\n                         \n\n          More importantly,  this also is a  case where there\n\nwere \"other  circumstances,\" see  id., which serve  to render\n                                     \n\nthe reasoning of  Gens inapposite.   There was evidence  from\n                      \n\n                    \n\n12.  Indeed, there was evidence which tended to indicate that\nWhite,  JoAnn   Brennan,  and  the  Harbor   Group  were  not\n                                                             \nfinancially  capable of repaying the loans on which they were\nthe named debtors.\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nwhich the jury could  have inferred, among other  things, (1)\n\nthat  McHugh knowingly caused false purposes for the loans to\n\nCharles  White and  Joseph Hoffman  to be  recorded on  their\n\nrespective  term sheets;  (2)  that McHugh  failed to  follow\n\ncustomary  bookkeeping procedures  in extending  the  loan to\n\nJoAnn Brennan; (3) that McHugh exceeded his loan authority in\n\nmaking the loan to the Harbor Group; and (4) that the loan to\n\nthe Harbor Group was  made for the purpose of  disguising the\n\nfact that  certain  loans to  Brennan and  Brennan-controlled\n\ninterests were delinquent.  Moreover, there was evidence from\n\nwhich  a jury could  have found that  McHugh structured these\n\nloans so that he would not  have to present them to the Board\n\nfor prior approval.13   In our view, these are  precisely the\n\ntypes  of  circumstances that  could  have  led the  jury  to\n\nconclude that McHugh, in  extending these loans, exhibited \"a\n\nreckless disregard\" of CSB's interests.  See Cyr, 712 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n732;  Fusaro, 708  F.2d at  21.   Accordingly, we  decline to\n            \n\nupset McHugh's convictions on the misapplication counts.14 \n\n                    \n\n13.  Certainly,  it is  reasonable  to infer  from this  that\nMcHugh thought the Board might not approve of these loans.\n\n14.  Relying on a  passage in Gens  where we  took note of  a\n                                  \ncategory  of  cases  in  which the  defendant  officials  had\n\"assured  the  named  debtor,  regardless  of  his  financial\ncapabilities, that they would look for repayment only to  the\nthird party  who actually received the  loan proceeds[,]\" see\n                                                             \nGens, 493 F.2d  at 222,  McHugh also argues  that because  he\n    \nneither  made  this type  of assurance  nor adopted  any such\nassurance  made   by  Brennan   to  a  nominal   debtor,  his\nconvictions  cannot  stand.   The  short  answer to  McHugh's\nargument is that, in  making this statement in Gens,  we were\n                                                   \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nB.  Pretrial and Trial Issues\n                             \n\n          As  we  have stated,  McHugh  and  Brennan raise  a\n\nnumber  of challenges  to decisions  the district  court made\n\nregarding the  parameters of the trial,  the admissibility of\n\ncertain evidence, and the jury instructions.  We discuss each\n\nargument in turn.\n\n     1.  Severance\n                  \n\n          McHugh  contends that the  district court committed\n\nreversible error in denying  his motion for severance.   More\n\nparticularly, McHugh asserts (1) that the number of counts in\n\nthe indictment created  jury confusion; (2) that there  was a\n\nprejudicial spillover of  evidence, particularly \"Rule 404(b)\n\nevidence,\"15 that  was admitted  solely against  Brennan; and\n\n                    \n\nnot   setting  forth   the   elements  of   the  offense   of\nmisapplication.  Instead, we were summarizing those instances\nwhere  bank  officials  had  been  found  guilty  of  willful\nmisapplication for making loans while aware that the proceeds\nwould be passed along to third parties.  See generally id. at\n                                                          \n221-22.  \n     Moreover, despite McHugh's assertion to the contrary,  a\ncareful reading  of the charge  reveals that the  trial judge\ndid not instruct  the jury that  the existence of one  of the\ntwo aforementioned types of assurances was  an element of the\ncrime of  willful misapplication.   Rather, the  court merely\ninformed the  jury that if  there had  been one of  these two\ntypes of  assurances, \"misapplication  may be found.\"   Thus,\neven if, as McHugh suggests, there was no evidence tending to\nindicate  either that he  assured the  named debtors  that he\nwould  look  only to  Brennan for  repayment  or that  he had\nadopted  such an  assurance made  by Brennan, the  absence of\nthis type of  evidence would  not mandate a  reversal of  his\nconvictions.\n\n15.  Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) provides:\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n(3)  that  the defendants  were  asserting  such inconsistent\n\ndefenses that severance was warranted.  We do not agree.\n\n          A  trial court  will grant  severance \"only  upon a\n\nstrong showing of prejudice.\"  E.g., United States v. Tejeda,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590212\"><a href=\"/opinion/590212/united-states-v-john-tejeda-united-states-of-america-v-paul-christian/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219 (1st Cir. 1992).

After carefully reviewing the entire record, we\n\ndiscern no plain error  in the district court's  admission of\n\nthis evidence.  Accordingly, we reject Brennan's argument for\n\nreversal on this ground.18 \n\n     3.  Gifford's Testimony Characterizing Brennan's Actions\n                                                             \n     Towards Him as \"Illegal, Unlawful and Fraudulent\"\n                                                      \n\n          Brennan's  next argument,  that  K.  Dun  Gifford's\n\ntestimony  that Brennan's  dealings with  him  were \"illegal,\n\nunlawful and  fraudulent\" prejudiced  him, suffers  a similar\n\n                    \n\n18.

However, he\nneither identifies a specific instance where he was  denied a\nlimiting   instruction  nor  attempts   to  explain  why  the\nadmission   of  this   evidence   was   highly   prejudicial.\nAccordingly, we view McHugh's  \"argument,\" to the extent that\nit can be  so characterized, as waived.   See, e.g., Cohen v.\n                                                          \nBrown Univ.,  No. 92-2483, slip op. at 30 (1st Cir.

Even if we construe the admission of this statement as\n\nerroneous,  Brennan's failure to object to it at trial limits\n\nour review to the now-familiar plain error rubric.  Id.  Once\n                                                       \n\nagain,  our review  persuades  us that  the district  court's\n\nadmission of this evidence did not rise to the level of plain\n\nerror.  Accordingly, we decline to reverse on this ground.\n\n     4.  Prosecutorial Misconduct    \n     4.  Prosecutorial Misconduct\n                                 \n\n          Brennan   makes   two   separate   arguments   that\n\nprosecutorial   misconduct  requires   a   reversal  of   his\n\nconviction.   He first claims  that he is  entitled to a  new\n\ntrial  because the prosecutor asked him on cross-examination,\n\nwithout a good faith  basis for the question, whether  he was\n\nterminated from prior employment  as a stockbroker at Tucker,\n\nAnthony, and Day.   The record reveals,  however, that George\n\nDowney  and  Brian  O'Rourke,  who were  interviewed  by  the\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation prior to trial, stated to the\n\ninterviewing agents that Brennan had been terminated from his\n\nemployment at  Tucker,  Anthony,  and  Day  for  unauthorized\n\ntrading.    Brennan has  not presented  us with  any evidence\n\nsuggesting that  the Government  knew, or should  have known,\n\nthat these statements  were false.  Accordingly,  there is no\n\nreason  for us to conclude that the question posed to Brennan\n\non cross-examination was not asked in good faith.19  \n\n                    \n\n19.  Brennan  also  argues,  in  a paragraph  that  can  most\ncharitably  be   described  as  cryptic,  that   one  of  the\nGovernment  prosecutors made  false  representations  to  the\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\n          Second,  Brennan contends that the Government acted\n\nimproperly  in  putting  into   issue,  both  in  its  cross-\n\nexamination of Brennan and in its rebuttal argument, the fact\n\nthat  Brennan did  not  introduce into  evidence any  records\n\ncorroborating certain aspects of his testimony.  In Brennan's\n\nview,  such actions  apparently were  tantamount to  making a\n\ncomment on  Brennan's failure to testify  and thereby shifted\n\nthe burden of proof  from the Government to Brennan.   Again,\n\nwe do not agree.\n\n          Without question, clearly it is impermissible for a\n\nprosecutor to comment, either  directly or by implication, on\n\na  defendant's failure  to  take the  stand  during a  trial.\n\nGriffin v.

However,\n                     \n\nwhen a defendant does take the stand, a prosecutor may attack\n\n                    \n\ndistrict  court at  the sidebar  conference during  which the\ncourt addressed whether the Government could inquire into the\ncircumstances  surrounding  Brennan's departure  from Tucker,\nAnthony,  and Day.  In so doing, however, Brennan relies upon\nan affidavit which  is not part of the record  before us, has\nnot  been made  part  of any  appendix  (as no  appendix  was\nsubmitted by appellants), and was not included in his inutile\naddendum.

R.   Evid.\n\n801(d)(2),21  of  certain deposition  testimony given  by the\n\nnon-testifying McHugh  during the course  of a civil  case in\n\n1989 entitles him to  a new trial.22  In  Brennan's view, the\n\nadmission of  this material infringed on  his Sixth Amendment\n\nright  to conduct  adequate cross-examination  of  an adverse\n\nwitness  and resulted in reversible  error.  We  do not share\n\nBrennan's belief that reversible error was committed.\n\n          As an  initial matter,  we agree with  Brennan that\n\nbecause  the  disputed  deposition  testimony  was not  given\n\n\"during the course and in furtherance of  the conspiracy,\" it\n\nwas  not admissible  under Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).   See\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n21.  Although  it did not so specify, it is apparent that the\ncourt   admitted  the   statement  as   \"a  statement   by  a\ncoconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance\nof the conspiracy.\"  See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).\n                        \n\n22.  During  McHugh's  cross-examination of  Brennan, Brennan\nrepresented that, at  the time  he had requested  two of  the\nloans  applied  for at  CSB, he  told  McHugh the  reasons he\nneeded the  loans.  In  response, the Government,  during its\ncross-examination   of   Brennan,   successfully  sought   to\nintroduce  the prior testimony of McHugh that he did not know\nthe  purposes of  the  loans at  issue  at the  time  Brennan\napplied for them. \n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\nUnited  States  v.

If,  for example, the  charge of\nwillful  misapplication were  premised entirely  upon  a bank\nofficer's non-disclosure of  a loan to  the Board, clearly  a\njury  could not convict that officer  of misapplication if it\nfound that s/he had  presented the loan to the  Board and the\nBoard had ratified it. \n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530641\"><a href=\"/opinion/530641/united-states-v-patrick-arthur-castro-united-states-of-america-v-herbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 995 (9th Cir. 1989).  We are  in full agreement\n\nwith the rule established by these courts.\n\n          In our view, the correctness of this recent line of\n\nauthority is best demonstrated by a brief explication of  the\n\npractical effects of its negation.   If we were to adopt  the\n\nabsolute rule  proposed by McHugh and  hold that ratification\n\nby a Board of Directors per se exonerates a bank officer from\n                              \n\ncharges  of  willful  misapplication,  then   we  would,  for\n\nexample, put beyond the reach of   656 a bank officer who, in\n\ncollusion  with  a rogue  Board,  provides bank  funds  to an\n\notherwise  unqualified  personal friend.    We simply  cannot\n\ndiscern  any  rational  justification  for  reaching  such  a\n\nresult.\n\n          In the instant matter,  the district court declined\n\nto instruct the  jury that, as a matter of  law, it could not\n\nconvict  McHugh of misapplication if  it found that the Board\n\nhad  ratified the loans at issue.  Instead, the court allowed\n\nMcHugh  to introduce  evidence of  ratification and  to argue\n\nthat this evidence  suggested that  McHugh had  no intent  to\n\ninjure  or defraud CSB.   We believe that,  in this case, the\n\ncourt's actions  were entirely appropriate.   Accordingly, we\n\nreject McHugh's claim of reversible error.\n\n     b.  Reference to False Entries in Overt Act Instructions\n                                                             \n\n          McHugh  next  contends  that because  the  district\n\ncourt entered  a judgment  of  acquittal notwithstanding  the\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\nverdict  for  McHugh  on  the  false  entry  counts,  it  was\n\nreversible  error for it to have allowed the jury to consider\n\nthe incident underlying one of the false entries counts as an\n\novert  act  in its  conspiracy  instruction.   The  error, in\n\nMcHugh's view, arises from  the fact that \"the jury  may have\n\nfound [McHugh] guilty of conspiracy solely on the basis of an\n\nalleged act which  was not  criminal.\"  However,  it is  well\n\nestablished that  an overt act need not be a crime.

Accordingly, we  reject\n      \n\nMcHugh's characterization of this instruction as erroneous.\n\nC.  Miscellany\n              \n\n          Brennan raises  three final arguments.   First,  he\n\nasserts that  his representation  at trial and  at sentencing\n\nwas constitutionally  deficient.  Next, he  contends that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in sentencing him to the\n\nhigh  end  of the  relevant  guideline  range.   Finally,  he\n\nmaintains that  the court abused its  discretion in adjusting\n\nhis  sentence upward  for obstruction  of justice.    None of\n\nBrennan's arguments requires extended discussion.\n\n     1.  Ineffective Assistance\n                               \n\n          Brennan claims that his representation at trial and\n\nat  sentencing   was  ineffective  and  violated   his  Sixth\n\nAmendment rights.   In so doing, Brennan  points primarily to\n\nthe failure  of trial counsel to  introduce certain documents\n\ninto evidence and the failure  of sentencing counsel to spend\n\nsufficient  time   preparing  for  the   sentencing  hearing.\n\nHowever, the  appellate record does not  indicate that either\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nof these  claims was properly raised  before and/or addressed\n\nby the  district court.  Moreover, our review  of the  record\n\npersuades us  that the  record is not  sufficiently developed\n\nfor  us to  address the merits  of Brennan's  Sixth Amendment\n\nclaim at this  time. Accordingly, we do  not reach it.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., United States v.  Gray, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578671\"><a href=\"/opinion/578671/united-states-v-kent-e-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st  Cir. 1992)\n                            \n\n(\"Time  and again  we have  held that  a claim  of inadequate\n\nrepresentation will not be resolved on direct appeal when the\n\nclaim has not been  raised in the district court,  unless the\n\ncritical  facts  are  not   in  dispute  and  a  sufficiently\n\ndeveloped record exists.\");  see also United States v. Hoyos-\n                                                             \n\nMedina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525275\"><a href=\"/opinion/525275/united-states-v-jorge-hernando-hoyos-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22  (1st Cir. 1989)  (\"Fairness to  the\n      \n\nparties  and  judicial  economy  both  warrant  that,  absent\n\nextraordinary  circumstances,  an  appellate  court  will not\n\nconsider an ineffective  assistance claim  where no  endeavor\n\nwas first made to  determine the claim at the  district court\n\nlevel.\").25 \n\n     2.  Sentence at High End of Guidelines Range\n                                                 \n\n          Brennan  also  contends  that  the  district  court\n\nabused  its discretion in sentencing  him to the  high end of\n\nthe  relevant guideline  range  while  departing downward  in\n\nsentencing McHugh.  The thrust of Brennan's argument is  that\n\nthe disparity between the sentences  of McHugh and himself is\n\n                    \n\n25.  Brennan may, of course, press his ineffective assistance\nclaim in the district court by way of a collateral proceeding\nunder 28 U.S.C.   2255.\n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\nunfair.   Established caselaw,  however, makes clear  that we\n\nhave  no jurisdiction to review a sentence that is within the\n\napplicable guideline  range.   E.g., United States  v. Aubin,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581511\"><a href=\"/opinion/581511/united-states-v-paul-edward-aubin/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  984 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 113 S.  Ct. 248\n                                            \n\n(1992).  Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of Brennan's\n\nargument.26\n\n     3.  Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice\n                                               \n\n          Finally,  Brennan asserts  that the  district court\n\nabused its  discretion by  enhancing his sentence  two levels\n\nfor   obstruction   of  justice   for   perceived  perjurious\n\ntestimony.  See U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 (\"If the defendant willfully\n               \n\nobstructed or  impeded, or  attempted to obstruct  or impede,\n\nthe  administration  of  justice  during  the  investigation,\n\nprosecution, or  sentencing of the instant  offense, increase\n\nthe  offense level by 2 levels.\") (1991 version).  A district\n                      2 \n\ncourt's application of this guideline provision is reviewable\n\nonly  for  clear  error.   E.g.,  United  States  v. Batista-\n                                                             \n\nPolanco,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556636\"><a href=\"/opinion/556636/united-states-v-johnny-rafael-batista-polanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22  (1st  Cir.  1991).   Our  review\n       \n\nconvinces  us   that  the  district  court's  application  of\n\nU.S.S.G.    3C1.1, far from being clearly erroneous, is amply\n\n                    \n\n26.  In his reply brief, Brennan also challenges the district\ncourt's  calculation of loss.  As noted above, see supra note\n                                                        \n7,  arguments made for the first time in an appellant's reply\nbrief are  deemed waived.   See Rivera-Muriente, 959  F.2d at\n                                               \n354.   Thus,  we do  not  address Brennan's  loss calculation\nchallenge.\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\nsupported   by   the  record.27     Accordingly,   we  reject\n\nBrennan's claim that the enhancement at issue was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          Having  rejected  each  of the  arguments  made  on\n\nappeal by Brennan and McHugh, we affirm their convictions and\n\nsentences.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                    \n\n27.  The  district  court  explicitly   found  each  of   the\nfollowing  to be examples  of Brennan's perjurious testimony:\n(1) Brennan's claim that he did not submit a PFS for purposes\nof influencing CSB's decision to provide him with the June 5,\n1987, $70,000 loan; (2)  Brennan's assertion that he expected\nall of his bounced  checks to be honored because  he expected\nthere to be sufficient  funds in the appropriate accounts  at\nthe  time the  checks  were presented  for  payment; and  (3)\nBrennan's statement  that he  did not acknowledge  having any\nnotes  payable to  others  on his  PFS because  of sufficient\n\"offsetting  assets.\"   There  was overwhelming  evidence  to\nsupport each of these findings.\n\n                             -30-\n                              30\n</pre>",
