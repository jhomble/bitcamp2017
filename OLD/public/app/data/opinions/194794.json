In this  case, involving  the\n                           \n\nunderpayment  of  postage  based  on  misrepresentations, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that  the False Claims Act, 31  U.S.C.  \n\n3729, did  not (prior to its amendment  in 1986) apply to so-\n\ncalled \"reverse false claims\"  whereby the government is paid\n\nless than its due.  A back-up claim for unjust enrichment was\n\ndismissed  on  res judicata  grounds.    We  agree  with  the\n                           \n\ndistrict court on the interpretation of the  False Claims Act\n\nbut disagree that the  unjust enrichment claim was barred  by\n\nres  judicata.  Accordingly, we affirm in part and vacate and\n             \n\nremand in part.\n\n     The  facts can  be briefly  stated.   Robert Paltrow  in\n\n1983-1984  set up  two corporations--American  Heart Research\n\nFoundation, Inc. (\"AHRF\") and American Cancer Research Funds,\n\nInc. (\"ACRF\")--purportedly to promote research  to cure these\n\ndiseases.   In July 1984  Paltrow submitted an application to\n\nthe  United  States  Postal  Service  to  obtain for  ACRF  a\n\nreduced-rate mailing permit; the application represented that\n\nACRF  was  a scientific  non-profit  entity  helping to  cure\n\ncancer.\n\n     ACRF  used  the  permit  to  mail  millions  of  letters\n\nsoliciting  for funds.   AHRF, without  applying for  its own\n\npermit,  used ACRF's  permit for  its own  solicitations.   A\n\ndirect  mail   organization  controlled  by   Paltrow,  North\n\nAmerican   Communications,   Inc.   (\"NAC\"),  conducted   the\n\n                             -2-\n\nmailings.  As a result of the special permit, the postage was\n\napproximately one-half  the usual  rate for bulk  third class\n\nmail,  and  ACRF  and  AHRF paid  the  Postal  Service  about\n\n$472,000  less  than  they  would have  without  the  special\n\npermit.\n\n     In fact ACRF and AHRF were not non-profit  scientific or\n\ncharitable  organizations  but  were old-fashioned  swindles,\n\nraising money on charitable pretexts  for the benefit of  the\n\norganizers.   In addition  to raising  funds,  ACRF sent  out\n\npurported  scientific  surveys,   of  no  scientific   value,\n\napparently  to gull  the public  into taking  ACRF seriously.\n\nNeedless to say,  the application ACRF filed  with the Postal\n\nService, making  the necessary claim that it  was a qualified\n\nnon-profit organization under the applicable regulations, was\n\nfalse.    AHRF's  mailings  were based  on  the  fraudulently\n\nobtained ACRF permit.\n\n     The solicitations occurred in 1984 and 1985.   In spring\n\n1986, the  government filed  a  criminal information  against\n\nACRF and AHRF  asserting ten  counts of mail  fraud under  18\n\nU.S.C.   1341;  NAC and  Paltrow were named  in the  criminal\n\ninformation  as  participating in  the  scheme  but were  not\n\nseparately charged.   The  government also filed  a complaint\n\nfor injunctive relief under  18 U.S.C.   1345.   That section\n\ngives the government a  civil action for expedited injunctive\n\n                             -3-\n\nrelief  where mail fraud is occurring  or is threatened.   No\n\ndamage claim was asserted in this action.\n\n     In April  1986 Paltrow pleaded  ACRF and AHRF  guilty on\n\nall ten counts  of mail fraud  in the criminal  case, and  he\n\nadmitted  that he and NAC  employed ACRF and  AHRF to defraud\n\nthe  public.  The civil injunction action was resolved on the\n\nsame day by a  consent order enjoining Paltrow and  all three\n\nentities from  charitable fund-raising through the  mails.  A\n\n$100,000 criminal fine was imposed on the bogus charities and\n\nthe  court ordered  that the  funds fraudulently  obtained be\n\nturned over to legitimate charities.\n\n     In 1990, after some preliminary negotiations failed, the\n\ngovernment filed the present case under the False Claims  Act\n\nagainst Paltrow  and his  three entities.   The  suit claimed\n\nunderpayment  of  postage  in  the  amount  of  $472,478  and\n\nmultiple  damages  as  provided  by  the  statute.    In  the\n\nalternative,  the  government  sought  single  damages  on an\n\nunjust enrichment  theory.    On  cross-motions  for  summary\n\njudgment, the  district court dismissed the  False Claims Act\n\nclaims on the ground that  the statute did not apply, and  it\n\ndismissed  the  unjust  enrichment   claim  on  res  judicata\n                                                             \n\ngrounds.\n\n     We  agree  with  the  district  court's   well  reasoned\n\ntreatment of the False Claims Act.  The statute, prior to the\n\n                             -4-\n\n1986 amendments, provided the government with a double-damage\n\ncivil action against anyone who \n\n     (1) knowingly presents  . . . to . .  . the [United\n     States]  Government  .  . .  a false  or fraudulent\n     claim for payment or approval; [or]\n\n     (2)  knowingly makes    . .  .  a false  record  or\n     statement to  get a false or  fraudulent claim paid\n     or approved[.]\n\n31  U.S.C.    3729(a)(1),  (2).   In  1986, the  statute  was\n\namended  not only to provide  for treble damages  but also to\n\napply to one who knowingly uses \"a false record or statement\"\n\nin order to \"conceal, avoid, or decrease an obligation to pay\n\n.  .  . money  .  .  . to  the  Government.\"1   31  U.S.C.   \n\n3729(a)(7).\n\n     The  current version  of  the False  Claims Act  clearly\n\nembraces reverse false claims, such as that presented in this\n\ncase,  whereby  someone  uses  a false  statement  to  secure\n\nservices  from the  government at  a reduced  rate.   But the\n\ngovernment  on this  appeal has  not pursued  its contention,\n\nrejected  by  the district  court,  that  the 1986  amendment\n\nenacting section  3729(a)(7) applies retroactively.  Thus the\n\nquestion is whether securing  reduced rate mailing privileges\n\nby  dint of a false statement can be classed as presenting \"a\n\n                    \n\n     1False Claims Amendments  Act of 1986,  Pub. L. No.  99-\n562,  100  Stat.  3153  (1986),  adding  inter  alia  section\n                                                    \n3729(a)(7) which employs the  quoted language.  See generally\n                                                             \nS. Rep. No. 345, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986).\n\n                             -5-\n\nfalse or fraudulent claim for payment  or approval\" or making\n\na false statement to get such a \"claim\" paid or approved.\n\n     We think the  natural weight of the  words, properly the\n\nstarting   point   for  the   inquiry,   leans  against   the\n\ngovernment's  reading.   A  \"claim for  payment or  approval\"\n\nsounds to ordinary ears like a bill from an army supplier for\n\nuniforms or some  like invoice presented  for payment or  for\n\napproval to permit payment.  The False Claims Act was in fact\n\nenacted in 1863  in the  wake of scandal  to \"combat  rampant\n\nfraud  in Civil  War defense  contracts.\"   S. Rep.  No. 345,\n\nsupra,  at 8.    An  attempt  to  secure  services  from  the\n     \n\ngovernment at reduced rates may be just as fraudulent, but at\n\nleast  judged  by  \"normal usage  or  understanding,\"  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  McNinch, 356  U.S. 595,  598 (1958),  it is  not a\n                  \n\n\"claim for payment or approval\" of payment.2\n\n     In McNinch,  the Supreme Court held  that an application\n               \n\nfor   credit  insurance,   requesting  the   Federal  Housing\n\nAdministration to insure certain bank loans, was not a \"claim\n\nfor payment or approval\"  within the meaning of  the statute.\n\nQuoting a lower court decision, the Court said that a \"claim\"\n\nagainst the government \"normally  connotes a demand for money\n\n                    \n\n     2The original  1863 statute reinforces this  point.  Its\nlanguage spoke of presenting  \"for payment or approval .  . .\nany claim upon  or against the Government  . . .  .\"  Act  of\n                                         \nMar.  2, 1863, c.  67, 12 Stat. 696.   The underscored phrase\nwas  omitted in a subsequent revision  but without any intent\nto alter substance.  31 U.S.C.   3729 (1982) (see explanatory\n                                                 \nnote).\n\n                             -6-\n\nor for some  transfer of  public property,\"  adding that  the\n\nstatute  \"was  not designed  to  reach  every  kind of  fraud\n\npracticed on  the Government.\" Id.  at 599. If  McNinch stood\n                                                       \n\nalone,  it   would  resolve   our  case,  for   a  customer's\n\nunderpayment for postal services does not involve any payment\n\nby the government or transfer of its property.\n\n     As is often the  case, there is a contrapuntal  theme in\n\nthe case law.   United States v. Neifert-White Co.,  390 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n228  (1968), held that  the False Claims  Act did  apply to a\n\nfalsified loan  application made  to a federal  agency where,\n\nunlike  McNinch,  the  false  statement was  made  \"with  the\n               \n\npurpose and effect of  inducing the Government immediately to\n\npart  with money.\"  Id.  at 232.   Neifert-White said broadly\n                                                \n\nthat  \"the  Act was  intended to  reach  all types  of fraud,\n\nwithout qualification, that might result in financial loss to\n\nthe  Government.\"    Id.  (footnote  omitted).    While  this\n                        \n\nlanguage  is helpful to  the government  in the  abstract, we\n\nread it as directed to the subject of the Court's discussion,\n\nnamely, claims, however unconventional, asking the government\n\nimmediately \"to part with money.\"  Id.3\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     3Not  only  did  the  Court  make  its  broad  statement\nimmediately after distinguishing  McNinch on the  ground that\n                                         \nit  involved   no  payment  of  government   money,  but  two\nparagraphs  later, in  the course  of summing  up, the  Court\nrepeated the point: \"This  remedial statute [the False Claims\nAct] reaches beyond `claims' which might be legally enforced,\nto all fraudulent attempts to cause the Government to pay out\n                                                             \nsums of money.\"  Id. at 233 (emphasis added).\n                    \n\n                             -7-\n\n     Subsequent  to Neifert-White,  the Supreme  Court quoted\n                                 \n\nwith approval, albeit in a footnote, its statement in McNinch\n                                                             \n\nthat \"claim\" in  the statute normally connotes  \"a demand for\n\nmoney  or  for some  transfer  of public  property.\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Bornstein,  423 U.S.  303, 309  n.4 (1976).   This\n                    \n\nreiterated equating  of \"claim\" with  a demand  for money  or\n\nproperty  is   fatal  to  the  government's   position  here:\n\nsecuring  a   reduced  rate   for  mailing,  even   by  false\n\nstatements,  is not a  claim for money  or property.   In the\n\nfederal  hierarchy, a  footnote  in a  Supreme Court  opinion\n\nnormally outweighs  a covey  of lower court  decisions.   The\n\nlower courts are,  in any  event, divided as  to whether  the\n\npre-1986  False  Claims Act  could  be  stretched to  include\n\nreverse  false  claims.    Compare, e.g.,  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nLawson, 522 F. Supp. 746 (D.N.J. 1981), with United States v.\n                                                          \n\nDouglas, 626 F. Supp. 621 (E.D. Va. 1985).\n       \n\n     The government is correct  that the Senate Report issued\n\nwhen  the statute was expanded in 1986 took the position that\n\nthe statute  had always  embraced underpayments and  that the\n\nnew language merely clarified  the statute.  See S.  Rep. No.\n                                                \n\n345, supra, at 19.   We are reluctant, however,  to give much\n          \n\nweight in  construing a Civil War statute  to Committee views\n\nfirst  expressed over 100 years later.  This is especially so\n\nwhen, as here, the original language of the Civil War statute\n                           \n\nwas even  more favorable  to the  construction that we  adopt\n\n                             -8-\n\nthan the pared down  version later adopted with no  intent to\n\nalter substance.\n\n     No doubt the effect of fraud on the government is pretty\n\nmuch  the same whether too much is extracted from the federal\n\ntreasury or too little paid in.  That is why Congress amended\n\nthe  statute  in 1986.    But  it is  one  thing  to construe\n\nambiguous language broadly in accord with a remedial purpose;\n\nit is quite another matter to stretch language beyond \"normal\n\nusage or understanding,\" McNinch,  356 U.S. at 598, when  the\n                                \n\nnatural  reading  matches  the  very  problem  that concerned\n\nCongress  at  the time  the statute  was  enacted.   When the\n\nSupreme Court  has thrice  affirmed that natural  reading and\n\nemphasized that a \"claim\"  in this context refers to  one for\n\nmoney or property, we think that  all doubts vanish as to the\n\ncourse this court should follow.\n\n     We turn now to the government's  alternative remedy--its\n\nclaim  for  single  damages  based on  an  unjust  enrichment\n\ntheory--and here  our views  differ from  those  of the  able\n\ndistrict  judge.   The  district court  held that  the \"claim\n\npreclusion\" branch of res judicata barred the government from\n                                  \n\nasserting an unjust enrichment claim after it secured a final\n\njudgment in  its civil  injunction action involving  the same\n\ntransactions.  We  conclude that for reasons  peculiar to the\n\ncivil injunction  statute, a successful  action brought under\n\n                             -9-\n\nthat  statute does not preclude a later separate claim by the\n\ngovernment for monetary relief.\n\n     Claim preclusion,  formerly the merger or  bar aspect of\n\nres judicata, precludes a party who has won or lost a case on\n            \n\nthe merits from  reasserting the  same cause of  action in  a\n\nsubsequent case.   In  some jurisdictions, this  doctrine has\n\nbeen  expanded  so  that  a  final  judgment  on  the  merits\n\nextinguishes any further \"rights of the plaintiff to remedies\n\nagainst  the [same] defendant with respect to all or any part\n\nof the transaction, or  series of connected transactions, out\n\nof which  the [earlier] action arose.\"   Restatement (Second)\n                                                             \n\nof Judgments    24 (1982).   See Diversified  Foods, Inc.  v.\n                                                        \n\nFirst  National Bank  of Boston,  985 F.2d  27, 30  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1993).  This broader definition, which converts old fashioned\n\nres judicata  doctrine into a  kind of compulsory  joinder of\n            \n\nrelated claims,  was  adopted  by this  court  in  Manego  v.\n                                                         \n\nOrleans Board of Trade, 773 F.2d 1,  5 (1st Cir. 1985), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied,  475 U.S.  1084 (1986),  for cases where  federal law\n      \n\ncontrols the issue.\n\n     Under ordinary  circumstances, Manego and Section  24 of\n                                          \n\nthe  Restatement  would pose  a  formidable  obstacle to  the\n\ngovernment's   unjust  enrichment  claim  brought  after  its\n\nsuccessful injunction  action.  The parties  are identical in\n\nthe two actions, both actions were civil, and  the injunction\n\naction  resulted in a final judgment on the merits.  Finally,\n\n                             -10-\n\nthe  two  remedies--an  injunction  and the  disgorgement  of\n\nunjust  enrichment--are premised on  the same  transaction or\n\nseries of transactions, and that is normally enough where the\n\ntransactions test of Manego is followed.\n                           \n\n     Res judicata is nevertheless a judge-made doctrine based\n                 \n\nupon practical concerns:  hostility to relitigation, wariness\n\nabout  double recovery,  and anxiety  that resources  will be\n\nwasted  by successive  suits where  one would  have sufficed.\n\nThe  doctrine is  not  to be  applied  where other  practical\n\nconcerns  outweigh the  traditional  ones and  favor separate\n\nactions.   See, e.g., Brown  v. Felsen, 442  U.S. 127 (1979).\n                                      \n\nHere, we  believe that those other  concerns counsel strongly\n\nin favor of allowing the government to bring a damage action,\n\nwhatever the  underlying theory,  even though  the government\n\nbrought and  concluded a separate injunction  action under 18\n\nU.S.C.   1345.\n\n     The purpose of section  1345 is  \"to allow  the Attorney\n\nGeneral to put  a speedy end to a fraud  scheme by seeking an\n                            \n\ninjunction  in  federal  district   court\"  as  soon  as  the\n\nrequisite  evidence is secured.  S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong.,\n\n2d Sess.  402 (1984)  (emphasis added).   The  statute itself\n\ndirects   the  district   court  to   \"proceed  as   soon  as\n\npracticable\" to  a hearing  and determination.   18  U.S.C.  \n\n1345(b).    The  legislative  history  shows  that   Congress\n\nauthorized  this  expedited  action  precisely  because  \"the\n\n                             -11-\n\ninvestigation of fraudulent  schemes often  takes months,  if\n\nnot years, before the case is ready for criminal prosecution\"\n\nand  in   the  meantime  \"innocent  people   continue  to  be\n\nvictimized.\"  S. Rep. No. 225, supra, at 402.\n                                    \n\n     The  same  concerns  that  prompted  Congress  to  adopt\n\nsection  1345 suggest  that  courts should  not handicap  and\n\ndelay  injunction actions  by insisting  that the  government\n\nassert  at the  same time  any civil  damage claims  that may\n\narise from  the same  transactions.  Commonly  the government\n\nmay want to secure additional facts,  including the amount of\n\ndamages,  before asserting such  claims and may  well wish to\n\nnegotiate  with  the  defendant  as to  settlement  once  the\n\nongoing violation has ceased.  To require that the government\n\nresolve  these matters within, and on the same time table as,\n\nthe expedited injunction action makes no sense.\n\n     The   government  is   not  automatically   exempt  from\n\nlimitations on  claim splitting, Federation  Dep't Stores  v.\n                                                         \n\nMoitie, 452  U.S. 394, 398 (1981), but those limitations will\n      \n\nnot  be  applied  where   they  would  frustrate  a  specific\n\nstatutory  objective.

For\n                                   \n\nthis  reason  the  government  is  permitted  to  enjoin  the\n\ncontinuation of an  illegal merger or other  violation of the\n\nantitrust laws and then bring its own separate  damage action\n\n                             -12-\n\nfor any damages it may have suffered.4  In our  view the same\n\npolicy  permits  the  government  to  litigate an  injunction\n\naction under  section 1345 to  final judgment and  then bring\n\nits own damage action as a separate case.\n\n     The treatment  of the unjust enrichment  claim on remand\n\nis a  matter for the district  court.  We express  no view on\n\nwhether any aspect  of the government's claim may be governed\n\nby the  issue preclusion  (or collateral estoppel)  branch of\n\nres  judicata, nor do we address any other questions that may\n             \n\nbe presented by  that claim.   The judgment  of the  district\n\ncourt is  affirmed so  far as it  dismissed the  government's\n                  \n\nclaims  under the  False Claims  Act, and  it is  vacated and\n                                                             \n\nremanded  as  to the  claim  based on  the  unjust enrichment\n        \n\ntheory.\n\n     It is so ordered.

In this  case, involving  the\n                           \n\nunderpayment  of  postage  based  on  misrepresentations, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that  the False Claims Act, 31  U.S.C.  \n\n3729, did  not (prior to its amendment  in 1986) apply to so-\n\ncalled \"reverse false claims\"  whereby the government is paid\n\nless than its due.  A back-up claim for unjust enrichment was\n\ndismissed  on  res judicata  grounds.    We  agree  with  the\n                           \n\ndistrict court on the interpretation of the  False Claims Act\n\nbut disagree that the  unjust enrichment claim was barred  by\n\nres  judicata.  Accordingly, we affirm in part and vacate and\n             \n\nremand in part.\n\n     The  facts can  be briefly  stated.   Robert Paltrow  in\n\n1983-1984  set up  two corporations--American  Heart Research\n\nFoundation, Inc. (\"AHRF\") and American Cancer Research Funds,\n\nInc. (\"ACRF\")--purportedly to promote research  to cure these\n\ndiseases.   In July 1984  Paltrow submitted an application to\n\nthe  United  States  Postal  Service  to  obtain for  ACRF  a\n\nreduced-rate mailing permit; the application represented that\n\nACRF  was  a scientific  non-profit  entity  helping to  cure\n\ncancer.\n\n     ACRF  used  the  permit  to  mail  millions  of  letters\n\nsoliciting  for funds.   AHRF, without  applying for  its own\n\npermit,  used ACRF's  permit for  its own  solicitations.   A\n\ndirect  mail   organization  controlled  by   Paltrow,  North\n\nAmerican   Communications,   Inc.   (\"NAC\"),  conducted   the\n\n                             -2-\n\nmailings.  As a result of the special permit, the postage was\n\napproximately one-half  the usual  rate for bulk  third class\n\nmail,  and  ACRF  and  AHRF paid  the  Postal  Service  about\n\n$472,000  less  than  they  would have  without  the  special\n\npermit.\n\n     In fact ACRF and AHRF were not non-profit  scientific or\n\ncharitable  organizations  but  were old-fashioned  swindles,\n\nraising money on charitable pretexts  for the benefit of  the\n\norganizers.   In addition  to raising  funds,  ACRF sent  out\n\npurported  scientific  surveys,   of  no  scientific   value,\n\napparently  to gull  the public  into taking  ACRF seriously.\n\nNeedless to say,  the application ACRF filed  with the Postal\n\nService, making  the necessary claim that it  was a qualified\n\nnon-profit organization under the applicable regulations, was\n\nfalse.    AHRF's  mailings  were based  on  the  fraudulently\n\nobtained ACRF permit.\n\n     The solicitations occurred in 1984 and 1985.   In spring\n\n1986, the  government filed  a  criminal information  against\n\nACRF and AHRF  asserting ten  counts of mail  fraud under  18\n\nU.S.C.   1341;  NAC and  Paltrow were named  in the  criminal\n\ninformation  as  participating in  the  scheme  but were  not\n\nseparately charged.   The  government also filed  a complaint\n\nfor injunctive relief under  18 U.S.C.   1345.   That section\n\ngives the government a  civil action for expedited injunctive\n\n                             -3-\n\nrelief  where mail fraud is occurring  or is threatened.   No\n\ndamage claim was asserted in this action.\n\n     In April  1986 Paltrow pleaded  ACRF and AHRF  guilty on\n\nall ten counts  of mail fraud  in the criminal  case, and  he\n\nadmitted  that he and NAC  employed ACRF and  AHRF to defraud\n\nthe  public.  The civil injunction action was resolved on the\n\nsame day by a  consent order enjoining Paltrow and  all three\n\nentities from  charitable fund-raising through the  mails.  A\n\n$100,000 criminal fine was imposed on the bogus charities and\n\nthe  court ordered  that the  funds fraudulently  obtained be\n\nturned over to legitimate charities.\n\n     In 1990, after some preliminary negotiations failed, the\n\ngovernment filed the present case under the False Claims  Act\n\nagainst Paltrow  and his  three entities.   The  suit claimed\n\nunderpayment  of  postage  in  the  amount  of  $472,478  and\n\nmultiple  damages  as  provided  by  the  statute.    In  the\n\nalternative,  the  government  sought  single  damages  on an\n\nunjust enrichment  theory.    On  cross-motions  for  summary\n\njudgment, the  district court dismissed the  False Claims Act\n\nclaims on the ground that  the statute did not apply, and  it\n\ndismissed  the  unjust  enrichment   claim  on  res  judicata\n                                                             \n\ngrounds.\n\n     We  agree  with  the  district  court's   well  reasoned\n\ntreatment of the False Claims Act.  The statute, prior to the\n\n                             -4-\n\n1986 amendments, provided the government with a double-damage\n\ncivil action against anyone who \n\n     (1) knowingly presents  . . . to . .  . the [United\n     States]  Government  .  . .  a false  or fraudulent\n     claim for payment or approval; [or]\n\n     (2)  knowingly makes    . .  .  a false  record  or\n     statement to  get a false or  fraudulent claim paid\n     or approved[.]\n\n31  U.S.C.    3729(a)(1),  (2).   In  1986, the  statute  was\n\namended  not only to provide  for treble damages  but also to\n\napply to one who knowingly uses \"a false record or statement\"\n\nin order to \"conceal, avoid, or decrease an obligation to pay\n\n.  .  . money  .  .  . to  the  Government.\"1   31  U.S.C.   \n\n3729(a)(7).\n\n     The  current version  of  the False  Claims Act  clearly\n\nembraces reverse false claims, such as that presented in this\n\ncase,  whereby  someone  uses  a false  statement  to  secure\n\nservices  from the  government at  a reduced  rate.   But the\n\ngovernment  on this  appeal has  not pursued  its contention,\n\nrejected  by  the district  court,  that  the 1986  amendment\n\nenacting section  3729(a)(7) applies retroactively.  Thus the\n\nquestion is whether securing  reduced rate mailing privileges\n\nby  dint of a false statement can be classed as presenting \"a\n\n                    \n\n     1False Claims Amendments  Act of 1986,  Pub.

A  \"claim for  payment or  approval\"\n\nsounds to ordinary ears like a bill from an army supplier for\n\nuniforms or some  like invoice presented  for payment or  for\n\napproval to permit payment.

Va. 1985).\n       \n\n     The government is correct  that the Senate Report issued\n\nwhen  the statute was expanded in 1986 took the position that\n\nthe statute  had always  embraced underpayments and  that the\n\nnew language merely clarified  the statute.  See S.  Rep. No.\n                                                \n\n345, supra, at 19.   We are reluctant, however,  to give much\n          \n\nweight in  construing a Civil War statute  to Committee views\n\nfirst  expressed over 100 years later.  This is especially so\n\nwhen, as here, the original language of the Civil War statute\n                           \n\nwas even  more favorable  to the  construction that we  adopt\n\n                             -8-\n\nthan the pared down  version later adopted with no  intent to\n\nalter substance.\n\n     No doubt the effect of fraud on the government is pretty\n\nmuch  the same whether too much is extracted from the federal\n\ntreasury or too little paid in.  That is why Congress amended\n\nthe  statute  in 1986.    But  it is  one  thing  to construe\n\nambiguous language broadly in accord with a remedial purpose;\n\nit is quite another matter to stretch language beyond \"normal\n\nusage or understanding,\" McNinch,  356 U.S. at 598, when  the\n                                \n\nnatural  reading  matches  the  very  problem  that concerned\n\nCongress  at  the time  the statute  was  enacted.   When the\n\nSupreme Court  has thrice  affirmed that natural  reading and\n\nemphasized that a \"claim\"  in this context refers to  one for\n\nmoney or property, we think that  all doubts vanish as to the\n\ncourse this court should follow.\n\n     We turn now to the government's  alternative remedy--its\n\nclaim  for  single  damages  based on  an  unjust  enrichment\n\ntheory--and here  our views  differ from  those  of the  able\n\ndistrict  judge.   The  district court  held that  the \"claim\n\npreclusion\" branch of res judicata barred the government from\n                                  \n\nasserting an unjust enrichment claim after it secured a final\n\njudgment in  its civil  injunction action involving  the same\n\ntransactions.  We  conclude that for reasons  peculiar to the\n\ncivil injunction  statute, a successful  action brought under\n\n                             -9-\n\nthat  statute does not preclude a later separate claim by the\n\ngovernment for monetary relief.\n\n     Claim preclusion,  formerly the merger or  bar aspect of\n\nres judicata, precludes a party who has won or lost a case on\n            \n\nthe merits from  reasserting the  same cause of  action in  a\n\nsubsequent case.   In  some jurisdictions, this  doctrine has\n\nbeen  expanded  so  that  a  final  judgment  on  the  merits\n\nextinguishes any further \"rights of the plaintiff to remedies\n\nagainst  the [same] defendant with respect to all or any part\n\nof the transaction, or  series of connected transactions, out\n\nof which  the [earlier] action arose.\"   Restatement (Second)\n                                                             \n\nof Judgments    24 (1982).

S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong.,\n\n2d Sess.  402 (1984)  (emphasis added).

Commonly  the government\n\nmay want to secure additional facts,  including the amount of\n\ndamages,  before asserting such  claims and may  well wish to\n\nnegotiate  with  the  defendant  as to  settlement  once  the\n\nongoing violation has ceased.
