In  this  criminal  appeal,  defendant-\n          Per  Curiam.\n                     \n\nappellant Albert  L. Giovanella,  III, advances  three arguments.\n\nWe  address  each  of  them  briefly (albeit  not  in  the  order\n\npresented).\n\n                                I\n\n          Appellant challenges his  conviction on Count X  of the\n\nindictment on  the  ground that  the  statute of  conviction,  18\n\nU.S.C.   1956(a)(1)  (1988), applies only to  persons who \"hid[e]\n\nproceeds of unlawful drug  sales.\"  Appellant's Brief at  48.  We\n\ndisagree.    The  language  of   the  statute  suggests  no  such\n\nlimitation, the legislative  history implies none, and  no court,\n\nto date, has  given credence to  this argument.   Count X of  the\n\nindictment  charged   appellant,  in  essence,   with  conducting\n\nfinancial  transactions  involving  the  proceeds  of  wire-fraud\n\nactivities.    By its  terms, the  statute of  conviction reaches\n\nknowing use of \"the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.\"  18\n\nU.S.C.   1956(a)(1)(A)(1).   At the time  of appellant's actions,\n\nwire  fraud  affecting financial  institutions was  so specified.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C.   1956(c)(7)(1)(D) (1988).  The charge contained in\n   \n\nCount   X   was,   therefore,   properly   laid   under   section\n\n1956(a)(1)(A)(1).   See United  States v.  Alford, 999 F.2d  818,\n                                                 \n\n822-23 (5th Cir.  1993); United States v.

Following a  guilty verdict, a\n\nreviewing  court   must  scrutinize   the  record,   drawing  all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of  the verdict, to ascertain if a\n\nrational jury  could have found  that the government  proved each\n\nelement  of the  crime beyond  a  reasonable doubt.   See  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Echeverri, 982 F.2d  675, 677 (1st Cir.  1993); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

The government can satisfy its burden of\n\nproof  by  either   direct  or  circumstantial  evidence.     See\n                                                                 \n\nEcheverri, 982 F.2d at 679; United States v.

See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677;\n                                               \n\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d at 711.  \n     \n\n          Using these guideposts, the quantum of evidence adduced\n\nhere  is more than  adequate.   If the  jury believed  either Dr.\n\nBarbati or Mr. Kittredge    and credibility calls are, of course,\n\nwithin the jury's exclusive province, see United States v. David,\n                                                                \n\n940 F.2d 722, 730 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 2301,\n                                               \n\n(1992)    either  man's  testimony was  sufficient  to show  that\n\nappellant committed fraud,  and that  the fraud  came within  the\n\ncontours of  section  1956(a)(1)(A)(1).   That  the jury  was  at\n\nliberty to  believe both  witnesses simply  adds frosting  to the\n\n                                4\n\ncake and highlights the futility of appellant's asseveration.\n\n                               III\n\n          The Sixth  Amendment provides  that persons  accused of\n\ncrime  shall receive the  benefit of  counsel for  their defense.\n\nSee  U.S.  Const. amend.  VI.   Appellant  says that  he  did not\n   \n\nreceive  this protection  because  his attorney  performed  below\n\nacceptable standards of  proficiency.  We do not  think that this\n\nsuggestion is ripe for our consideration.\n\n          \"We  have held  with  a  regularity  bordering  on  the\n\nmonotonous  that fact-specific  claims of  ineffective assistance\n\ncannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions,\n\nbut, rather, must originally be  presented to, and acted upon by,\n\nthe trial court.\"   United States v.

The rule has a  salutary purpose:\n\nsince  claims of ineffective  assistance involve a  binary, fact-\n\ndominated  analysis     the  defendant  must  show,  first,  that\n\ncounsel's performance was constitutionally deficient and, second,\n\nthat  the  deficient  performance  prejudiced  the  defense,  see\n                                                                 \n\n                                5\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.  668, 687 (1984)   such claims\n                        \n\ntypically should  not be  addressed in the  first instance  by an\n\nappellate tribunal.  See Mala, slip op. at 10; Costa, 890 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n483; Hoyas-Medina, 878  F.2d at 22.  Moreover,  because the trial\n                 \n\njudge is intimately familiar with the case and is \"usually in the\n\nbest  position  to   assess  both  the   quality  of  the   legal\n\nrepresentation  afforded to the  defendant in the  district court\n\nand the  impact of any  shortfall in that  representation,\" Mala,\n                                                                \n\nslip op.  at 10, his  insights are often invaluable  in assessing\n\nineffective  assistance  claims.    For  these  reasons  we  have\n\nundertaken \"first  instance\"  review  of  ineffective  assistance\n\nclaims on direct appeal only  when the critical facts are  not in\n\ndispute  and  the  record  is  sufficiently  developed  to  allow\n\nreasoned  consideration of the  arguments presented.   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nNatanel, 938 F.2d at 309.\n       \n\n          This  case fits within the general rule, not within the\n\nlong-odds exception to it.   On the record presently compiled, we\n\ncannot  satisfactorily  address either  prong  of  the Strickland\n                                                                 \n\ninquiry.    Hence,   the  issue  of  ineffective   assistance  is\n\nprematurely before us.\n\n                                IV\n\n          We need go  no further.  We affirm  the judgment below,\n\nwithout prejudice,  however, to  appellant's right  to raise  his\n\nclaim  of ineffective assistance in a proceeding brought pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C.   2255.   We express no opinion as to  the merit (or\n\nlack of merit) of any such claim.\n\n                                6\n\n          It is so ordered.\n                          \n\n                                7\n",

Sec. 1956(a)(1) (1988), applies only to persons who \"hid[e] proceeds of unlawful drug sales.\"  Appellant's Brief at 48.  We disagree.  The language of the statute suggests no such limitation, the legislative history implies none, and no court, to date, has given credence to this argument.  Count X of the indictment charged appellant, in essence, with conducting financial transactions involving the proceeds of wire-fraud activities.  By its terms, the statute of conviction reaches knowing use of \"the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(a)(1)(A)(1).  At the time of appellant's actions, wire fraud affecting financial institutions was so specified.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(c)(7)(1)(D) (1988).  The charge contained in Count X was, therefore, properly laid under section 1956(a)(1)(A)(1).   See United States v. Alford, 999 F.2d 818, 822-23 (5th Cir. 1993);  United States v. Paramo, 998 F.2d 1212, 1217-18 (3d Cir. 1993);  United States v. Taylor, 984 F.2d 298, 301 (9th Cir. 1993);   United States v.

Following a guilty verdict, a reviewing court must scrutinize the record, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, to ascertain if a rational jury could have found that the government proved each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.   See United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993);   United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1005 (1993).

Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 910 (1989).  To sustain a conviction, a reviewing court need not conclude that only a guilty verdict could appropriately be reached;  it is enough that the jury's determination draws its essence from a plausible reading of the record.

Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 457 (1st Cir. 1983).  The rule has a salutary purpose:  since claims of ineffective assistance involve a binary, fact-dominated analysis-the defendant must show, first, that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense,  see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)-such claims typically should not be addressed in the first instance by an appellate tribunal.  See Mala, slip op. at 10;   Costa, 890 F.2d at 483;  Hoyas-Medina, 878 F.2d at 22.  Moreover, because the trial judge is intimately familiar with the case and is \"usually in the best position to assess both the quality of the legal representation afforded to the defendant in the district court and the impact of any shortfall in that representation,\" Mala, slip op. at 10, his insights are often invaluable in assessing ineffective assistance claims.  For these reasons we have undertaken \"first instance\" review of ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal only when the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the arguments presented.

Giovanella, III, advances three arguments.  We address each of them briefly (albeit not in the order presented).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Appellant challenges his conviction on Count X of the indictment on the ground that the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(a)(1) (1988), applies only to persons who \"hid[e] proceeds of unlawful drug sales.\"  Appellant's Brief at 48.  We disagree.  The language of the statute suggests no such limitation, the legislative history implies none, and no court, to date, has given credence to this argument.  Count X of the indictment charged appellant, in essence, with conducting financial transactions involving the proceeds of wire-fraud activities.  By its terms, the statute of conviction reaches knowing use of \"the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(a)(1)(A)(1).  At the time of appellant's actions, wire fraud affecting financial institutions was so specified.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(c)(7)(1)(D) (1988).  The charge contained in Count X was, therefore, properly laid under section 1956(a)(1)(A)(1).   See United States v. Alford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"612118\"><a href=\"/opinion/612118/united-states-v-christopher-p-alford/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span>, 822-23 (5th Cir. 1993);  United States v.

Following a guilty verdict, a reviewing court must scrutinize the record, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, to ascertain if a rational jury could have found that the government proved each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.   See United States v. Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 677 (1st Cir. 1993);   United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 711 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></span> (1993).  The government can satisfy its burden of proof by either direct or circumstantial evidence.   See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679;   United States v. Rivera-Santiago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521900\"><a href=\"/opinion/521900/united-states-v-antonio-rivera-santiago-aka-junior-vivique-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span>, 1079 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></span> (1989).  To sustain a conviction, a reviewing court need not conclude that only a guilty verdict could appropriately be reached;  it is enough that the jury's determination draws its essence from a plausible reading of the record.   See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677;   Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using these guideposts, the quantum of evidence adduced here is more than adequate.  If the jury believed either Dr. Barbati or Mr. Kittredge-and credibility calls are, of course, within the jury's exclusive province,  see United States v. David, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566001\"><a href=\"/opinion/566001/united-states-v-shmuel-david-united-states-of-america-v-jaime-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 730 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2301</span></span>, (1992)-either man's testimony was sufficient to show that appellant committed fraud, and that the fraud came within the contours of section 1956(a)(1)(A)(1).  That the jury was at liberty to believe both witnesses simply adds frosting to the cake and highlights the futility of appellant's asseveration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment provides that persons accused of crime shall receive the benefit of counsel for their defense.  See U.S. Const. amend.  VI. Appellant says that he did not receive this protection because his attorney performed below acceptable standards of proficiency.  We do not think that this suggestion is ripe for our consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\"  United States v.
