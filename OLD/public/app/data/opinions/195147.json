Brown, Assistant  United States Attorney, with whom A.\n                                                                  \nJohn Pappalardo, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n           \n\n                                         \n\n                       January 18, 1994\n                                         \n\n          Per  Curiam.   In this  appeal, plaintiff-appellant\n                      \n\nThomas Welsh  challenges the  district court's  determination\n\nthat he had not suffered retaliation actionable under the Age\n\nDiscrimination Employment Act (\"ADEA\").  We affirm.\n\n          In  1987,  plaintiff  became  coordinator  of   the\n\nBrockton-West   Roxbury   Veterans   Administration   Medical\n\nCenter's  (\"VA Medical  Center's\")  Key  Club, an  outpatient\n\nrecreational therapy program.  His job classification at that\n\ntime was General  Service (\"GS\") level 6.   In February 1989,\n\nbelieving  that he was  performing duties above  the level of\n\nGS-6, plaintiff sought  an upgrade of his  job classification\n\nby requesting a  \"desk audit.\"1  The audit  was not performed\n\nuntil May 1989.\n\n          Meanwhile, in  March 1989, maintaining that  he was\n\nbeing  denied  an  upgrade  because  of  age  and  disability\n\ndiscrimination2, plaintiff  filed an informal  complaint with\n\nthe  Equal   Employment  Opportunity   Commission  (\"EEOC\").3\n\n                    \n\n1.  In  a desk audit,  a Personnel Specialist  interviews the\nemployee and  his/her supervisor and  determines (1)  whether\nthe employee's  job description  accurately depicts  the work\nperformed  by  the employee,  and  (2)  whether  the  job  is\nclassified at the proper GS level.\n\n2.  Plaintiff  has  a  heart condition  and  is  a recovering\nalcoholic.\n\n3.  The charges in plaintiff's  informal complaint formed the\nbasis for a formal EEOC  complaint filed by plaintiff in June\n1989,  and  for  plaintiff's  non-retaliation  discrimination\nclaims in the  instant lawsuit.   The district court  granted\ndefendant  summary judgment  on these  claims  in June  1991.\nPlaintiff does not appeal from this ruling. \n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nPlaintiff  asserts  that, as  a  result  of  his filing  this\n\ncomplaint, he suffered  the following  forms of  retaliation:\n\n(1)  an unpleasant discussion  with his  supervisor regarding\n\nthe filing of the complaint;  (2) a reassignment from the Key\n\nClub position to  a job working in an  inpatient setting; (3)\n\nan  unfounded  accusation  by  his  supervisor  that  he  had\n\nmisappropriated  funds   in  connection   with  a   Key  Club\n\nThanksgiving  dinner; (4) a reprimand from his supervisor for\n\na previously approved absence from an  awards dinner; and (5)\n\na   reduction  in  duties  prior  to  the  desk  audit,  thus\n\neliminating the  potential of a  status upgrade.   These five\n\nincidents formed the basis for his retaliation claim.\n\n          In  addition   to  granting  summary   judgment  on\n\nplaintiff's non-retaliation discrimination  claims, see supra\n                                                             \n\nnote  3,  the district  court  also  ruled,  at  the  summary\n\njudgment  stage, that  the  first  four  of  the  above-named\n\nincidents did not give rise  to a retaliation claim under the\n\nADEA.  However, the court found that the issue of whether the\n\nreduction  in  plaintiff's  duties prior  to  the  desk audit\n\nviolated  the  ADEA's  retaliation  provision,  29  U.S.C.   \n\n623(d),4 was triable.  \n\n                    \n\n4.  In pertinent part, 29 U.S.C.   623(d) provides:\n\n     It   shall   be  unlawful   for   an  employer   to\n     discriminate  against  any   of  his  employees  or\n     applicants  for  employment  .  .  .  because  such\n     individual  . .  . has  opposed  any practice  made\n     unlawful by [the ADEA],  or because such individual\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          We  consider only this  last claim to  be raised.5 \n\nDefendant Secretary argues  that a reduction in  duties could\n\nnot be an \"adverse employment  action\" giving rise to a claim\n\nunder Section  623(d) under  Connell v.  Bank of  Boston, 924\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1169,  1179 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,  111 S.  Ct. 2828\n                                          \n\n(1991).   There,  applying the  rule that  where there  is no\n\ndirect evidence of retaliation, a plaintiff must demonstrate,\n\ninter alia, that s/he suffered an \"adverse employment action\"\n          \n\nin order to make out a prima facie showing of retaliation, we\n\nsaid,  with respect to  that phrase, \"Most  cases involving a\n\nretaliation claim are based on an employment action which has\n\nan adverse impact on the employee, i.e., discharge, demotion,\n\nor failure to promote.\"  924 F.2d at 1179. \n\n          The  Secretary points  to  the  letters \"i.e.\"  and\n\nreads into them  a ruling that  only discharge, demotion,  or\n\nfailure  to  promote  can  constitute an  adverse  employment\n\naction within  the Act.   We do not  agree.   Concededly, not\n\nevery unpleasant  matter short  of those  listed in  Connell,\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n     . .  . has made  a charge, testified,  assisted, or\n     participated  in any  manner  in an  investigation,\n     proceeding, or litigation under [the ADEA].\n\n5.  Plaintiff also  generally contends,  without explanation,\nthat, \"unlike the plaintiff in Connell,\" he was harmed by the\n                                      \nother alleged  instances of retaliation cited above.  We have\nrepeatedly  warned litigants  that issues  adverted  to in  a\nperfunctory manner  and without  developed argumentation  are\ndeemed waived on appeal.  E.g., United States  v. Innamorati,\n                                                            \n996 F.2d  456,  468  (1st  Cir.  1993).    Here,  plaintiff's\nattempts  to distinguish  Connell with  regard  to the  other\n                                 \nalleged   instances   of  discrimination   are   perfunctory.\nAccordingly, we regard them as waived.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nsupra creates  a cause  of action, but  many things,  such as\n     \n\nconstant  rudeness,  conspicuous discriminatory  acts,  etc.,\n\ncould  have  an  adverse  effect  upon  employment.    Within\n\nreasonable limits, in  order to arrive at  a determination, a\n\ncase by case review is necessary.   With respect, we take the\n\ncourt's \"i.e.\" as  an inadvertency for  \"e.g.\", or, at  most,\n\ndictum far beyond  the opinion that, after  consideration, we\n\nfeel  we  do not  have  to  recognize.    We say  this  fully\n\nrealizing that, as  newly constituted panels we  are normally\n\nbound by prior panel decisions  on point.  E.g., Broderick v.\n                                                          \n\nRoache, 996 F.2d 1294, 1298 (1st Cir. 1993).  Further support\n      \n\nfor  our  reading  of  Connell,  appears  from  that  panel's\n                              \n\nreference  to \"most  cases\" and  to  reliance upon  precedent\n\npointing to  incidents beyond  mere \"discharge,  demotion, or\n\nfailure to promote.\"\n\n          The  fact, however, that  the action taken  in this\n\ncase  could survive  a motion  for summary judgment  does not\n\nmean   that  the  court   could  not  thereafter   weigh  it.\n\nPlaintiff's  complaint was that  the reduction in  his duties\n\nmeant that he  would not be  eligible for an  upgrade in  his\n\nstatus.  As to this claim, the court made a finding, not here\n\nchallenged,  that plaintiff would  not have received  such an\n\nupgrade in any event.  On this basis the court's finding that\n\nplaintiff failed  to make  a prima  facie showing of  adverse\n\nemployment action  must stand.   And, as we have  made clear,\n\nplaintiff cannot make out  a prima facie case of  retaliation\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nwithout showing such  adverse action.  See Connell,  924 F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 1179.  \n\n          Accordingly,  we  affirm   the  court's  entry   of\n\njudgment against plaintiff on his retaliation claim.6\n\n                    \n\n6.  Because we affirm  the court's ruling that  plaintiff did\nnot  make out a prima facie  case of retaliation, we need not\nreach   plaintiff's  challenge   to   the  district   court's\nalternative finding regarding pretext.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n",

Innamorati,\n                                                            \n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  468  (1st  Cir.  1993).    Here,  plaintiff's\nattempts  to distinguish  Connell with  regard  to the  other\n                                 \nalleged   instances   of  discrimination   are   perfunctory.\nAccordingly, we regard them as waived.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nsupra creates  a cause  of action, but  many things,  such as\n     \n\nconstant  rudeness,  conspicuous discriminatory  acts,  etc.,\n\ncould  have  an  adverse  effect  upon  employment.    Within\n\nreasonable limits, in  order to arrive at  a determination, a\n\ncase by case review is necessary.   With respect, we take the\n\ncourt's \"i.e.\" as  an inadvertency for  \"e.g.\", or, at  most,\n\ndictum far beyond  the opinion that, after  consideration, we\n\nfeel  we  do not  have  to  recognize.    We say  this  fully\n\nrealizing that, as  newly constituted panels we  are normally\n\nbound by prior panel decisions  on point.  E.g., Broderick v.\n                                                          \n\nRoache, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610549\"><a href=\"/opinion/610549/william-t-broderick-v-francis-roache-arthur-morgan-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1298 (1st Cir. 1993).  Further support\n      \n\nfor  our  reading  of  Connell,  appears  from  that  panel's\n                              \n\nreference  to \"most  cases\" and  to  reliance upon  precedent\n\npointing to  incidents beyond  mere \"discharge,  demotion, or\n\nfailure to promote.\"\n\n          The  fact, however, that  the action taken  in this\n\ncase  could survive  a motion  for summary judgment  does not\n\nmean   that  the  court   could  not  thereafter   weigh  it.\n\nPlaintiff's  complaint was that  the reduction in  his duties\n\nmeant that he  would not be  eligible for an  upgrade in  his\n\nstatus.  As to this claim, the court made a finding, not here\n\nchallenged,  that plaintiff would  not have received  such an\n\nupgrade in any event.  On this basis the court's finding that\n\nplaintiff failed  to make  a prima  facie showing of  adverse\n\nemployment action  must stand.   And, as we have  made clear,\n\nplaintiff cannot make out  a prima facie case of  retaliation\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nwithout showing such  adverse action.  See Connell,  924 F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 1179.  \n\n          Accordingly,  we  affirm   the  court's  entry   of\n\njudgment against plaintiff on his retaliation claim.6\n\n                    \n\n6.  Because we affirm  the court's ruling that  plaintiff did\nnot  make out a prima facie  case of retaliation, we need not\nreach   plaintiff's  challenge   to   the  district   court's\nalternative finding regarding pretext.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n</pre>",
