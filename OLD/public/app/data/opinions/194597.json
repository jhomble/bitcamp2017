They argue primarily that the evidence presented\n\nto the jury was too flimsy to support the guilty  verdicts.  They\n\nargue  secondarily  that  the  trial  judge  improperly  excluded\n\ncertain evidence and, moreover, exhibited a bias against them.\n\n          We  start with  bedrock.  \"The  standard of  review for\n\nsufficiency challenges  is whether  the total evidence,  taken in\n\nthe light  most amicable to  the prosecution,  together with  all\n\nreasonable  inferences favorable  to it,  would allow  a rational\n\nfactfinder  to  conclude  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the\n\ndefendant  was guilty as charged.\"   United States  v. Maraj, 947\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 520, 522-23 (1st Cir. 1991).   We have recently applied this\n\nstandard  to  a test  of  evidentiary  sufficiency  in an  appeal\n\nprosecuted by appellants' codefendant, Alfredo Nueva.  See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Nueva, 979 F.2d 880 (1st Cir. 1992).  No useful purpose\n               \n\nwould be served  by canvassing anew  the full range of  facts set\n\nout therein.  See id. at 881-83.  It suffices at this juncture to\n                     \n\nsay  that  we found  those facts  more  than adequate  to support\n\nNueva's conviction  on both charges.  Id. at 883-85.  Most of the\n                                         \n\nsame evidence applies with equal force to the present appellants.\n\n          We do not propose  to reinvent the wheel.   Instead, we\n\n                                3\n\nadd only a few brief comments regarding the events at  issue.  On\n\nthe  main question   evidentiary sufficiency   the jury was faced\n\nwith conflicting  accounts of what  transpired off  the coast  of\n\nPuerto  Rico on the night of December 5, 1990.  Appellants argued\n\nthat  they were  simply in  the wrong  place at  the wrong  time;\n\nduring  a pre-purchase test drive of  a speedboat, in the dark of\n\nnight,  they  experienced engine  trouble  and  were stranded  in\n\nprecisely  the  spot chosen  by drug  dealers  for an  airdrop of\n\nseveral bales of cocaine worth an enormous amount of money.  \n\n          The prosecution, however, did not believe that the long\n\narm  of co(ke)incidence stretched quite  so far.   It presented a\n\nwealth of surveillance evidence from which a rational  jury could\n\nconclude  that  a  small  airplane, running  with  no  navigation\n\nlights, signalled  appellants' boat (also running without lights)\n\nand  then  proceeded  by  prearrangement to  drop  several  large\n\nobjects  (marked  with chemical  lights)  which  the boat's  crew\n\nhauled from the sea.  When, thereafter, the capture trap began to\n\nclose,  the  three men  aboard  the  boat hastily  discarded  the\n\nobjects  and  attempted to  evade  apprehension  (although to  no\n\navail).    When  boarded,  the  boat's  engine  was  still  warm,\n\nindicating recent use and undermining appellants' stranded-at-sea\n\naccount.  Several  bales of cocaine,  with chemical lights  still\n\nattached, were found floating in the area where the speedboat had\n\nbeen.   There were  no other  vessels in  the vicinity (save  for\n\nofficial watercraft).  \n\n          We  think  that  the  cumulative  evidence  permitted a\n\n                                4\n\nseries of logical inferences:  that appellants knowingly set  out\n\nto rendezvous with the aircraft; that, being the only individuals\n\nin the  area, appellants were  the designated  receptors for  the\n\nsmuggle; that,  by design, appellants retrieved  the cocaine from\n\nthe water; and that appellants, knowing that their newly acquired\n\ncargo  comprised  illegal  contraband,  jettisoned  it  when  law\n\nenforcement personnel  drew near.  No  more was exigible.   As we\n\nrecently  wrote, \"the  culpability  of  [a] defendant's  presence\n\nhinges upon whether the  circumstances fairly imply participatory\n\ninvolvement.\"  United States v. Echeverri, No. 92-1426, slip  op.\n                                         \n\nat  5  (1st Cir.  Jan. 5,  1993).   Here, a  rational factfinder,\n\ndrawing plausible inferences as  suggested above, could well have\n\ndiscerned participatory involvement.  See, e.g., United States v.\n                                                              \n\nMorales-Cartagena, Nos.  91-2079, 91-2080,  slip op. at  4-6 (1st\n                 \n\nCir.  Feb. 23, 1993); Nueva, 979 F.2d at 883-85; United States v.\n                                                              \n\nLopez,  944 F.2d  33,  40  (1st  Cir.  1991);  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nHernandez-Bermudez,  857  F.2d 50,  54  (1st  Cir. 1988);  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Flores  Perez, 849 F.2d  l, 3 (1st  Cir. 1988); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Alvarez, 626 F.2d 208, 210 (1st Cir. 1980).    \n                 \n\n          In  sum,  the  appellants  seem to  be,  literally  and\n\nfiguratively, in  the same  boat as Nueva.   The jury,  the trial\n\njudge,  and  the Nueva  panel  believed  that  the  evidence  was\n                      \n\nsufficient to  convict on  all counts, as  do we.   Although  the\n\ngovernment's case  was largely circumstantial, the  jury, on this\n\nrecord,  could   certainly  have  chosen  to   believe  that  the\n\nconverging  circumstances pointed persuasively  toward a sinister\n\n                                5\n\ntruth and  been convinced thereby beyond any  reasonable doubt of\n\nappellants' complicity and guilt.   The law, as we have said, \"is\n\nnot  so struthious as  to compel a  criminal jury  to ignore that\n\nwhich is perfectly obvious.\"  United States v. Ingraham, 832 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n229, 240  (1st Cir. 1987), cert.  denied, 486 U.S.   1009 (1988);\n                                        \n\nsee also  United States v.  Smith, 680  F.2d 255,  260 (1st  Cir.\n                                 \n\n1982)  (\"Neither  juries  nor  judges  are  required  to  divorce\n\nthemselves  of common  sense, but  rather  should apply  to facts\n\nwhich  they  find  proven   such  reasonable  inferences  as  are\n\njustified  in the  light of  their experience  as to  the natural\n\ninclinations  of human  beings.\"),  cert. denied,  459 U.S.  1110\n                                                \n\n(1983).          \n\n          The other  issues raised  by  appellants deserve  scant\n\ncomment.    The  district  court's  exclusion  of  the  so-called\n\ntracklog was  well within its discretion; the record reveals that\n\nappellants never laid  a proper foundation  for the admission  of\n\nthis evidence.  Lastly, the claim of judicial bias  amounts to no\n\nmore than  shooting from the  lip.  In  any event, the  very same\n\nclaim was advanced  to the Nueva panel and soundly  rejected.  We\n                                \n\nadopt that panel's assessment.  See Nueva, 979 F.2d at 885.\n                                         \n\n          We need go no  further.  Our examination of  the papers\n\nreveals  that   appellants'  counsel   has  been   using  devious\n\ndistortions  and  gross  exaggerations as  weapons  of  appellate\n\nadvocacy.   They are easily belied  by the record and  do not aid\n\nhis clients' cause.  For essentially the same reasons as were set\n\nout  in  the  Nueva  opinion, the  appellants'  convictions  pass\n                   \n\n                                6\n\nmuster. \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                                7\n",

The jury,  the trial\n\njudge,  and  the Nueva  panel  believed  that  the  evidence  was\n                      \n\nsufficient to  convict on  all counts, as  do we.   Although  the\n\ngovernment's case  was largely circumstantial, the  jury, on this\n\nrecord,  could   certainly  have  chosen  to   believe  that  the\n\nconverging  circumstances pointed persuasively  toward a sinister\n\n                                5\n\ntruth and  been convinced thereby beyond any  reasonable doubt of\n\nappellants' complicity and guilt.

The  district  court's  exclusion  of  the  so-called\n\ntracklog was  well within its discretion; the record reveals that\n\nappellants never laid  a proper foundation  for the admission  of\n\nthis evidence.  Lastly, the claim of judicial bias  amounts to no\n\nmore than  shooting from the  lip.  In  any event, the  very same\n\nclaim was advanced  to the Nueva panel and soundly  rejected.  We\n                                \n\nadopt that panel's assessment.  See Nueva, 979 F.2d at 885.\n                                         \n\n          We need go no  further.  Our examination of  the papers\n\nreveals  that   appellants'  counsel   has  been   using  devious\n\ndistortions  and  gross  exaggerations as  weapons  of  appellate\n\nadvocacy.   They are easily belied  by the record and  do not aid\n\nhis clients' cause.  For essentially the same reasons as were set\n\nout  in  the  Nueva  opinion, the  appellants'  convictions  pass\n                   \n\n                                6\n\nmuster. \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                                7\n</pre>",
