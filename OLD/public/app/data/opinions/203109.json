Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Lynch, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n          John F. Winston with whom Stephen H.

Brinton and Rogers Towers were on brief for\nScenic America, Inc., amicus curiae.\n\n\n                          January 18, 2008\n\f             LYNCH,    Circuit          Judge.        The    city     of   Concord,   New\n\nHampshire,       enacted     an    ordinance          prohibiting      all     Electronic\n\nMessaging Centers (\"EMCs\"), which the city found were detrimental\n\nto traffic safety and community aesthetics.                      EMCs are signs which\n\ndisplay electronically changeable messages (as opposed to signs\n\nwith    static    or   manually         changeable        messages)    and    so   display\n\nilluminated text that can change frequently, for instance by\n\nscrolling or flashing.             Naser Jewelers, Inc. (\"NJI\"), a Concord\n\nbusiness, sought and was denied a preliminary injunction against\n\nthe    enforcement      of        the        ordinance      on   grounds      of   facial\n\nunconstitutionality under the First Amendment.\n\n             Concord's ban on all EMCs is content-neutral.                          Globe\n\nNewspaper Co. v. Beacon Hill Architectural Comm'n, 100 F.3d 175,\n\n183 (1st Cir. 1996).         As a result, the ordinance is permissible if\n\nit    is   narrowly    tailored         to    serve   a     significant      governmental\n\ninterest and leaves open alternative channels of communication. An\n\nordinance is narrowly tailored if it does not burden substantially\n\nmore speech than necessary to further the government's legitimate\n\ninterests.       Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 799 (1989).\n\nThe ordinance need not be the least restrictive means to serve\n\nthose interests.       Id. at 798; Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 726\n\n(2000); Globe Newspaper, 100 F.3d at 188.                        Concord's ordinance\n\nmeets these criteria and we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f                                       I.\n\n            Concord has enacted sign ordinances as part of its\n\nmunicipal code. The stated purposes of these ordinances are, among\n\nother    things,   to    \"[m]aintain    and   enhance     the   appearance   and\n\naesthetic environment of the City\" and to \"[i]mprove pedestrian and\n\ntraffic safety.\"        Concord, N.H., Code of Ordinances § 28-6-1(b) &\n\n(d) (2007).\n\n            Before      2006,   Concord's     sign    ordinances     contained\n\nprohibitions on EMCs, but provided exceptions for EMCs which\n\ndisplayed solely time, date, and temperature indicators.              In 2005,\n\na New Hampshire Superior Court judge ruled that the regulations\n\nviolated the First Amendment because they favored signs that\n\ndisplayed time, date, or temperature.            That erroneous ruling has\n\nsince been overruled by the New Hampshire Supreme Court. Carlson's\n\nChrysler v. City of Concord, 2007 WL 3306945, at *1 (N.H. Nov. 8,\n\n2007).\n\n            In light of the interim Superior Court ruling, Concord\n\namended   its   ordinances      in   August   2006   to   prohibit   all   EMCs,\n\nincluding ones indicating only time, date, or temperature.                   The\n\ncity's current ordinance, challenged here, prohibits all signs that\n\n\"appear animated or projected\" or \"are intermittently or intensely\n\nilluminated or of a traveling, tracing, scrolling, or sequential\n\nlight type\" or \"contain or are illuminated by animated or flashing\n\nlight.\"    Concord, N.H., Code of Ordinances § 28-6-7(h) (2007).\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            On October 3, 2006, NJI sought permission to construct\n\nand operate an EMC on the premises of its retail store in Concord.\n\nThe sign would be located on Loudon Road, a high-traffic corridor\n\nthat includes a mix of retail and residential development and a\n\nlarge public park and fire station.                   The location is in close\n\nproximity      to     an    elementary       school     and   more   residential\n\nneighborhoods. The store's current sign is a freestanding sign six\n\nfeet off the ground that features a model of a large gold ring with\n\na polished diamond and text reading \"Joseph Michaels Diamonds.\"\n\n(Joseph Michaels Diamonds is a trade name used by NJI.)                       The\n\nproposed EMC would be located directly underneath the current sign\n\nand would measure 2.7 feet by 5.3 feet.\n\n            NJI is eager to install an EMC at its store in Concord\n\nbecause of its experience with an EMC at another retail location in\n\nDover, New Hampshire.            NJI had earlier installed an EMC at its\n\nDover store.    Originally, NJI changed the copy on its EMC only once\n\nevery ten minutes.         Early in 2006, NJI began changing the text once\n\nevery four to five seconds. NJI claims to have experienced a\n\nsizable increase in sales, some eighteen percent, as a result of\n\nthese more frequent copy changes.\n\n            On October 13, Concord's code administrator denied NJI's\n\napplication     because      the    proposed   EMC    would   violate   Concord's\n\nregulations.        On October 25, NJI sought declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief   and   damages      in     federal   district    court,   claiming   that\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fConcord's regulations impermissibly infringed its First Amendment\n\nrights.   NJI also sought a preliminary injunction to allow it to\n\ninstall an EMC in time for the holiday shopping season.\n\n          A magistrate judge denied NJI's request for a preliminary\n\ninjunction on November 22, 2006.       The district court denied the\n\ninjunction on different analytical grounds on June 25, 2007.              The\n\ndistrict court held inapplicable the commercial speech test in\n\nCentral Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission,\n\n447 U.S. 557 (1980), on which the magistrate judge had relied,\n\nbecause the EMC ban is content-neutral and does not apply merely to\n\ncommercial    entities.1   Rather,   the   district      court   upheld   the\n\nordinance under the rule that content-neutral regulations are\n\nconstitutional provided that they are narrowly tailored to serve a\n\nsignificant    governmental   interest     and   allow     for   reasonable\n\nalternative channels of communication.           See, e.g., Gun Owners'\n\nAction League, Inc. v. Swift, 284 F.3d 198, 212 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n     1\n          The commercial speech framework is \"substantially\nsimilar\" to the test for time, place, and manner restrictions.\nLorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 554 (2001) (quoting\nBd. of Trs. of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 477\n(1989)) (internal quotation marks omitted).      Specifically, the\nCentral Hudson inquiry considers whether the asserted governmental\ninterest in the regulation is substantial, whether the regulation\ndirectly advances that asserted interest, and whether the\nregulation is not more extensive than necessary to serve that\ninterest. Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566.\n          Central Hudson, in turn, was narrowed in City of\nCincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 416 (1993),\nwhere the Court held that it was the city's burden to establish a\n\"reasonable fit\" between its asserted interests and its regulation.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fThe district court concluded that NJI had not shown that it was\n\nlikely to succeed on the merits and therefore was not entitled to\n\na preliminary injunction.   This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                II.\n\n          Appellate   review   of   the     denial   of    a   preliminary\n\ninjunction is for abuse of discretion.        Rio Grande Cmty. Health\n\nCtr., Inc. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56, 68 (1st Cir. 2005).                 The\n\ndistrict court correctly noted the four factors considered in\n\ndetermining whether a preliminary injunction ought to issue: \"1) a\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits, 2) irreparable harm to the\n\nplaintiff should preliminary relief not be granted, 3) whether the\n\nharm to the defendant from granting the preliminary relief exceeds\n\nthe harm to the plaintiff from denying it, and 4) the effect of the\n\npreliminary injunction on the public interest.\"           Id. at 75.\n\n          We consider whether NJI has demonstrated a probability of\n\nsuccess on the merits. When considering First Amendment claims, we\n\nengage in de novo review of the district court's conclusions of law\n\nand mixed questions of law and fact.         Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay,\n\nLesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 567 (1995);\n\nSullivan v. Town of Augusta, ___ F.3d ___, 2007 WL 4357565, at *5\n\n(1st Cir. Dec. 14, 2007).\n\n          Billboards and other signs are protected by the First\n\nAmendment, but courts have long approved subjecting them to the\n\npolice powers of local government.        Prime Media, Inc. v. City of\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fBrentwood, 398 F.3d 814, 818 (6th Cir. 2005).     As the Supreme Court\n\nhas noted, \"signs take up space and may obstruct views, distract\n\nmotorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other\n\nproblems that legitimately call for regulation.           It is common\n\nground that governments may regulate the physical characteristics\n\nof signs . . . .\"     City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 48 (1994).\n\n           A threshold question in cases involving challenges to\n\ngovernment restrictions on speech is whether the restriction at\n\nissue is content-neutral or, to the contrary, is content-based.\n\nSee, e.g., Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 642\n\n(1994); Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 736\n\n(1st Cir. 1995); see also K. Sullivan & G. Gunther, First Amendment\n\nLaw 193 (1999).       In Globe Newspaper, this court held that the\n\n\"principal inquiry in determining content neutrality . . . is\n\nwhether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because\n\nof disagreement with the message it conveys.\"          100 F.3d at 183\n\n(quoting Nat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at 737) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).     Furthermore, \"[a] regulation that serves purposes\n\nunrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if\n\nit has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not\n\nothers.\"   Id. (quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 791) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n           As   the    district   court   correctly   noted,   Concord's\n\nprohibition on EMCs does not discriminate based on content.        EMCs\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fmight   communicate   any    number   of    messages    --   from    a   business\n\nadvertising a sale to a high school congratulating its victorious\n\nteams -- and all EMCs are similarly prohibited.\n\n           NJI insists that Concord's regulation is content-based\n\nbecause   city   officials     gave   preference       to    time,   date,    and\n\ntemperature messages in its prior ordinance.            They assert Concord\n\nis using the current regulation as a stopgap measure, with plans to\n\nreinstate the original prohibition -- with exceptions for time,\n\ndate, and temperature displays -- following the state Supreme\n\nCourt's decision.     This argument goes nowhere.              The regulation\n\ncurrently in place, which is the only one before us, contains no\n\nexceptions.      Concord's    regulation     is   properly     analyzed      as   a\n\ncontent-neutral restriction on speech.\n\n           NJI argues that the city bears the burden of proof on all\n\nissues. The district court accepted this argument, at least on the\n\nultimate question of the statute's constitutionality, citing to\n\nAshcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 542 U.S. 656, 666\n\n(2004). Ashcroft, however, involved a challenge to a content-based\n\nspeech restriction. See id. at 665. Content-based regulations are\n\npresumed to be unconstitutional and the government bears a heavy\n\nburden of justification.      R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377,\n\n382 (1992); McGuire v. Reilly, 260 F.3d 36, 43 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           Here, plaintiff has brought a facial attack on a content-\n\nneutral ordinance.     In a facial attack case, it is plaintiff's\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fburden to show that the law has no constitutional application.\n\nSee, e.g., Gonzales v. Carhart, ___ U.S. ___, 127 S. Ct. 1610, 1639\n\n(2007); N.Y. State Club Ass'n v. City of New York, 487 U.S. 1, 11\n\n(1988); McGuire, 260 F.3d at 47.\n\n           The Supreme Court has said that when the government\n\n\"seeks to restrict speech based on its content\" that \"the usual\n\npresumption of constitutionality afforded [legislative] enactments\n\nis reversed.\" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, 529 U.S. 803,\n\n817 (2000).    The implication is that content-neutral statutes\n\ncontinue to enjoy a presumption of constitutionality.\n\n           The Supreme Court's most recent case on content-neutral\n\nregulations is Hill v. Colorado.         Neither Hill nor Ward v. Rock\n\nAgainst   Racism   explicitly   speaks   to   burdens   of    proof   on   the\n\ndifferent portions of the test used to assess content-neutral\n\nregulations.   But there is other law saying, in content-neutral\n\nregulation cases, but often citing to content-based cases, that the\n\ngovernment must show that it has met the element, within the larger\n\ntest, that the regulation is narrowly tailored.         See, e.g., Turner\n\nBroad., 512 U.S. at 665; Casey v. City of Newport, 308 F.3d 106,\n\n111 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           We need not resolve here the intricacies of burdens of\n\nproof and production.    For our purposes, and indeed in many First\n\nAmendment cases of content-neutral regulations, the issue of who\n\nhas the burden of proof will not be important.               After all, the\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fgovernment's purpose for the regulation is often expressly stated,\n\nas are the reasons for that choice and not others, thus removing\n\nthose issues from having to be proven. In this case, no matter who\n\nhas the burden as to which elements of the test, plaintiff's claim\n\nfails.\n\n            NJI also argues that it is does not matter whether\n\nConcord's regulations are content-neutral or content-based because\n\n\"the targeted speech is primarily commercial\" and Central Hudson\n\napplies to all restrictions involving commercial speech.            This is\n\nsimply incorrect.    Central Hudson serves as an alternative to the\n\nmore exacting standards applied to content-based restrictions on\n\nnon-commercial speech.      See Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 562-63;\n\nSullivan & Gunther, supra, at 163, 177-78.            The standards for\n\ncontent-neutral restrictions do not vary by whether the plaintiff\n\nis   exercising   commercial    speech.      The   uniform   case   law   on\n\nrestrictions on signs is clear on this point.           See, e.g., Prime\n\nMedia, 398 F.3d at 819-22 (evaluating content-neutral restrictions\n\non billboards using narrow tailoring analysis); Messer v. City of\n\nDouglasville, 975 F.2d 1505, 1509-11 (11th Cir. 1992) (same).\n\n            Content-neutral regulations are permissible so long as\n\nthey are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental\n\ninterest    and   allow   for   reasonable    alternative    channels     of\n\ncommunication. The narrow tailoring test is a form of intermediate\n\nscrutiny.    \"[R]egulations that are unrelated to the content of\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fspeech are subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny . . . .\"\n\nTurner Broad., 512 U.S. at 642; see also Sullivan, 2007 WL 4357565,\n\nat *12 (same); Sullivan & Gunther, supra, at 199 (same).\n\n              Concord's    ordinance      satisfies       the   requirements     for\n\nconstitutionality.        The ordinance is a content-neutral regulation,\n\nit   serves    substantial     governmental        interests,    it   is   narrowly\n\ntailored, and it leaves open reasonable alternative channels of\n\ncommunication.\n\nA.            Governmental Interests\n\n              From the face of Concord's sign regulations, the city's\n\nstated goals include promoting both traffic safety and community\n\naesthetics.      If a regulation is content-neutral on its face and\n\nstates its purposes, we look to the legislative body's statement of\n\nintent. \"We will not look behind th[e] express statement of intent\n\nas to a law neutral on its face.\"            Torres Rivera v. Calderón Serra,\n\n412 F.3d 205, 211 (1st Cir. 2005).                It is problematic to permit a\n\nplaintiff, in a content-neutral case, to attempt to prove that\n\nthere is an intent apart from this express statement because \"the\n\nlegislature's subjective intent is both unknown and unknowable.\"\n\nMcGuire,   260    F.3d    at   47.      Because     Concord's    regulations     are\n\ncontent-neutral     on    their      face,   it    was   an   empty   exercise   for\n\nplaintiff to have conducted examinations of Concord's mayor or code\n\nenforcement officer in an effort to show the stated reasons for the\n\nordinance were not the real reasons.                     Legislative history is\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fpermissible for other purposes, but not this.   See, e.g., McGuire,\n\n260 F.3d at 48 (considering legislative history in determining\n\nwhether a statute was narrowly tailored).\n\n          Both traffic safety and community aesthetics have long\n\nbeen recognized to constitute significant governmental interests.\n\nMetromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 507-08 (1981)\n\n(plurality opinion) (collecting cases and concluding that there can\n\nbe no \"substantial doubt that the twin goals that the ordinance\n\nseeks to further -- traffic safety and the appearance of the city\n\n-- are substantial governmental goals\"); see also, e.g., City of\n\nCincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 425 (1993)\n\n(acknowledging city's legitimate interest in the aesthetics of its\n\nsidewalks); Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for\n\nVincent, 466 U.S. 789, 807 (1984) (\"[T]he visual assault on the\n\ncitizens of Los Angeles . . . constitutes a significant substantive\n\nevil within the City's power to prohibit.\").      Concord's stated\n\njustifications   plainly   constitute   significant    governmental\n\ninterests.\n\nB.        Narrow Tailoring, but Not Least Restrictive Means\n\n          NJI argues that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored.\n\nIn determining whether a provision is narrowly tailored, courts\n\napply the test articulated in Ward v. Rock Against Racism and\n\nreiterated by the Supreme Court in Hill v. Colorado.   Under Ward,\n\n\"the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied 'so long as the\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f. . . regulation promotes a substantial government interest that\n\nwould be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.'\"                  491\n\nU.S. at 799 (quoting United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 689\n\n(1985)).     \"[T]his standard does not mean that a . . . regulation\n\nmay burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further\n\nthe government's legitimate interests.\"           Id.    Concord, however, is\n\nnot required to choose the least restrictive means possible: \"[T]he\n\nregulation will not be invalid simply because a court concludes\n\nthat the government's interest could be adequately served by some\n\nless-speech-restrictive alternative.\"            Id. at 800.\n\n            Concord's    interests   in     traffic     safety   and   community\n\naesthetics    would     be   achieved     less   effectively      without    the\n\nordinance's prohibition on EMCs.            We give some respect to \"the\n\naccumulated, common-sense judgments of local lawmakers and of the\n\nmany reviewing courts that billboards are real and substantial\n\nhazards to traffic safety.\" Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 509 (plurality\n\nopinion).    It is given that a billboard can constitute a traffic\n\nhazard.     It follows that EMCs, which provide more visual stimuli\n\nthan traditional signs, logically will be more distracting and more\n\nhazardous.     See Chapin Furniture Outlet, Inc. v. Town of Chapin,\n\n2006 WL 2711851, at *4 (D.S.C. Sept. 20, 2006), vacated on other\n\ngrounds by Chapin Furniture Outlet, Inc. v. Town of Chapin, 2007 WL\n\n3193854 (4th Cir. Oct. 30, 2007) (holding, in the context of EMC\n\nregulations, that \"the Town's judgment that flashing or scrolling\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fsigns constitute a traffic hazard . . . is not unreasonable\").\n\nIndeed, plaintiff's own witness stated that bypassers focus more on\n\nrapidly   blinking   electronic   signs   than   static   signs.   This\n\nconstitutes a greater hazard.       Further, for drivers a flashing\n\nlight is often a signal of hazard on the roadway, a signal which\n\nitself slows and disrupts the traffic flow.\n\n            NJI argues that Concord must perform studies to prove\n\nthat the ban on EMCs in fact supports its stated interests.\n\nConcord was under no obligation to do such studies or put them into\n\nevidence.   Justice Brennan suggested the need for such evidence in\n\nhis concurring opinion in Metromedia, but seven justices rejected\n\nhis position.      Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 521, 528 (Brennan, J.,\n\nconcurring); see also Outdoor Sys. Inc. v. City of Lexana, 67 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1231, 1238 (D. Kan. 1999) (\"Relying on Justice Brennan's\n\nconcurring opinion in Metromedia, plaintiff claims that the City\n\nhas the burden to come forward with evidence which demonstrates\n\nthat billboards actually impair traffic safety and the beauty of\n\nthe environment.     Plaintiff ignores the fact that seven Justices\n\nrejected Justice Brennan's analysis in this regard.\").\n\n            As noted in Ackerly Communications of the Northwest Inc.\n\nv. Krochalis, 108 F.3d 1095, 1099-1100 (9th Cir. 1997), \"[a]s a\n\nmatter of law Seattle's ordinance, enacted to further the city's\n\ninterests in esthetics and safety, is a constitutional restriction\n\non commercial speech without detailed proof that the billboard\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fregulation will in fact advance the city's interests.\"                       Similarly,\n\nthe Sixth Circuit observed in rejecting the argument that a city\n\nneeded to produce evidence to justify its regulation on billboard\n\nsize: \"To ask the City to justify a size restriction of 120 square\n\nfeet over, say, 200 square feet or 300 square feet would impose\n\ngreat costs on local governments . . . .\"                   Prime Media, 398 F.3d at\n\n823-24.\n\n            Courts        have    \"repeatedly       deferred      to   the   aesthetic\n\njudgments   of     municipalities          and    other     government    bodies     when\n\nevaluating restrictions on protected expression.\" Globe Newspaper,\n\n100 F.3d at 190 (quoting Gold Coast Pub'ns, Inc. v. Corrigan, 42\n\nF.3d    1336,    1346     (11th    Cir.     1994))    (internal        quotation     mark\n\nomitted).        Although courts do not wholly defer to legislative\n\njudgments, see id., there is no basis to doubt that Concord's\n\naesthetic       concern    --     \"not   rendering        [its]    visual    image    and\n\ncommunity character to be that of a potential Times Square\" --\n\nwould be achieved far less effectively absent a ban on EMCs.\n\n            Concord's ordinance also does not burden substantially\n\nmore speech than necessary. NJI argues that because Concord's City\n\nCouncil considered but rejected alternatives to a complete ban on\n\nEMCs, the ban necessarily burdens too much speech because there are\n\nalternatives.       However, the government is not required to choose\n\nthe least restrictive approach in content-neutral regulation.                          In\n\nGlobe    Newspaper,       this     court    held     that    a    regulation   banning\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\fnewspaper distribution boxes from the public streets of Boston's\n\nhistoric Beacon Hill district passed constitutional muster.                 100\n\nF.3d at 195.         The opinion noted that although less restrictive\n\nalternatives existed, the regulating commission was not required to\n\nadopt them if they would serve its interests less effectively. Id.\n\nat 189-90.      NJI, to its credit, concedes this is the rule of Globe\n\nNewspaper, but asks us to overrule the case.           Not only do we, as a\n\npanel, lack the power to do so, Irving v. United States, 162 F.3d\n\n154, 160 (1st Cir. 1998), but we would not, even if we could, for\n\nthe rule is correct.\n\n             Here,     the   city   argues     that   NJI's   proposed      less\n\nrestrictive alternatives were problematic and it was not required\n\nto accept them.       Ironically, NJI argues less than a total ban would\n\nbe a less restrictive alternative.             The city had tried such an\n\nordinance -- an EMC ban allowing only time, date, and temperature\n\ndisplays -- before and was met with a lawsuit.            The alternative of\n\nallowing EMCs but imposing certain conditions on them, such as\n\nlimiting the number of times per day a message could change, would\n\nhave created steep monitoring costs and other complications for the\n\ncity.   There is evidence in the record, permissible on this issue,\n\nthat the city explicitly considered and rejected alternatives, and\n\nthe   reasons    for   its   choice.     See   McGuire,   260   F.3d   at   49.\n\nConcord's concerns about the proposed alternatives to its present\n\nEMC ordinance are legitimate.\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f            NJI makes a separate argument that Concord's ordinance is\n\nforbidden because it is a ban of an entire medium of communication.\n\nFactually   the   argument   raises   the   issue   of   how   one   defines\n\n\"medium.\"    Legally, the principle is untenable here.2         Billboards\n\nand signs are not banned, nor is the use of signs with manually\n\nchangeable type.     Even if EMCs are considered to be a particular\n\n\"medium,\" the fact that a regulation bans a particular medium does\n\nnot mean that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored.                 Globe\n\nNewspaper, 100 F.3d at 191-92.     When the medium itself is the \"evil\n\nthe city [seeks] to address,\" then a ban of that entire medium is\n\nnarrowly tailored.    Id. at 192 (citing Vincent, 466 U.S. at 810).\n\n            As the Supreme Court observed in Metromedia, \"If the city\n\nhas a sufficient basis for believing that billboards are traffic\n\nhazards and are unattractive, then obviously the most direct and\n\nperhaps the only effective approach to solving the problems they\n\ncreate is to prohibit them.\"     453 U.S. at 508 (plurality opinion).\n\nC.          Alternative Channels\n\n            Concord has not foreclosed NJI from using other means of\n\ncommunication.     As the district court pointed out, NJI can still\n\nuse static and manually changeable signs.            It can also place\n\nadvertisements in newspapers and magazines and on television and\n\n\n     2\n          This case does not raise the concerns noted in Globe\nNewspaper about entire medium bans involving the exercise of speech\nby an individual or a medium that constitutes a \"uniquely valuable\nmode of expression.\" 100 F.3d at 192 (citing Ladue, 512 U.S. at\n54-55).\n\n                                   -17-\n\fthe Internet, distribute flyers, circulate direct mailings, and\n\nengage in cross-promotions with other retailers.                                  See, e.g.,\n\nSullivan,         2007   WL   4357565,       at   *22    (holding      that    the     use   of\n\nsidewalks, gatherings on state land, hand-held banners, leafleting,\n\nvehicular         processions,         and     smaller-scale         outdoor      gatherings\n\nconstituted sufficient alternatives for people unable to afford a\n\ncity's parade permit); La Tour v. City of Fayetteville, 442 F.3d\n\n1094,     1097      (8th      Cir.     2006)      (concluding        that    an      ordinance\n\nprohibiting         flashing      or    blinking      electronic       signs      left   open\n\nsufficient alternative channels of communication, including using\n\nnon-electronic signs); Globe Newspaper, 100 F.3d at 193 (concluding\n\nthat street vendors were an adequate alternative to on-street\n\nnewspaper boxes); Chapin Furniture Outlet, 2006 WL 2711851, at *4\n\n(holding      that       an   ordinance        banning     EMCs      \"does     not    prevent\n\n[p]laintiff from displaying any message . . . on a sign not\n\nprohibited\" and noting that plaintiff could use banners, flags,\n\nsandwich boards, and inflatable signs as alternatives to EMCs).\n\n              NJI argues that it is losing potential customers, and\n\ntherefore profit, because of its inability to place an EMC at its\n\nConcord location.             The maximizing of profit is not the animating\n\nconcern      of    the    First      Amendment.         The   fact    that     restrictions\n\nprohibit a form of speech attractive to plaintiff does not mean\n\nthat    no   reasonable        alternative         channels    of     communication          are\n\navailable.         \"The First Amendment does not guarantee a right to the\n\n\n                                               -18-\n\fmost cost-effective means of [speech] . . . .\"                Globe Newspaper,\n\n100 F.3d at 193.    Indeed, we have \"upheld . . . alternative means\n\nof communication despite diminution in the quantity of speech, a\n\nban on a preferred method of communication, and a reduction in the\n\npotential audience.\"      Sullivan, 2007 WL 4357565, at *22.\n\n          Concord's      prohibition    of   EMCs    is   a   constitutionally\n\npermissible     content-neutral     regulation.           Since   NJI   has   no\n\nprobability of success on the merits of its claim, we need not\n\naddress   the    other    factors      in    the    preliminary     injunction\n\ndetermination.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

New Hampshire, enacted an ordinance prohibiting all Electronic Messaging Centers (\"EMCs\"), which the city found were detrimental to traffic safety and community aesthetics. EMCs are signs which display electronically changeable messages (as opposed to signs with static or manually changeable messages) and so display illuminated text that can change frequently, for instance by scrolling or flashing. Naser Jewelers, Inc. (\"NJI\"), a Concord business, sought and was denied a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance on grounds of facial unconstitutionality under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>Concord's ban on all EMCs is content-neutral. <i>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Beacon Hill Architectural Comm'n,</i> 100 F.3d 175, 183 (1st Cir.1996). As a result, the ordinance is permissible if it is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and leaves open alternative channels of communication. An ordinance is narrowly tailored if it does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further the government's legitimate interests. <i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism,</i> 491 U.S. 781, 799, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989). The ordinance need not be the least restrictive means to serve those interests. <i>Id.</i> at 798, 109 S.Ct. 2746; <i>Hill v. Colorado,</i> 530 U.S. 703, 726, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000); <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> 100 F.3d at 188. Concord's ordinance meets these criteria and we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Concord has enacted sign ordinances as part of its municipal code. The stated purposes of these ordinances are, among other things, to \"[m]aintain and enhance the appearance and aesthetic environment of the City\" and to \"[i]mprove pedestrian and traffic safety.\" Concord, N.H., Code of Ordinances § 28-6-1(b) &amp; (d) (2007).</p>\n<p>Before 2006, Concord's sign ordinances contained prohibitions on EMCs, but provided exceptions for EMCs which displayed solely time, date, and temperature indicators. In 2005, a New Hampshire Superior Court judge ruled that the regulations violated the First Amendment because they favored signs that displayed time, date, or temperature. That erroneous ruling has since been overruled by the New Hampshire Supreme Court. <i>Carlson's Chrysler v. City of Concord,</i> 938 A.2d 69, 70-71 (N.H. 2007).</p>\n<p>In light of the interim Superior Court ruling, Concord amended its ordinances in August 2006 to prohibit all EMCs, including ones indicating only time, date, or temperature. The city's current ordinance, challenged here, prohibits all signs that \"appear animated or projected\" or \"are intermittently or intensely illuminated or of a traveling, tracing, scrolling, or sequential light type\" or \"contain or are illuminated by animated or flashing light.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> Concord, N.H., Code of Ordinances § 28-6-7(h) (2007).</p>\n<p>On October 3, 2006, NJI sought permission to construct and operate an EMC on the premises of its retail store in Concord. The sign would be located on Loudon Road, a high-traffic corridor that includes a mix of retail and residential development and a large public park and fire station. The location is in close proximity to an elementary school and more residential neighborhoods. The store's current sign is a freestanding sign six feet off the ground that features a model of a large gold ring with a polished diamond and text reading \"Joseph Michaels Diamonds.\" (Joseph Michaels Diamonds is a trade name used by NJI.) The proposed EMC would be located directly underneath the current sign and would measure 2.7 feet by 5.3 feet.</p>\n<p>NJI is eager to install an EMC at its store in Concord because of its experience with an EMC at another retail location in Dover, New Hampshire. NJI had earlier installed an EMC at its Dover store. Originally, NJI changed the copy on its EMC only once every ten minutes. Early in 2006, NJI began changing the text once every four to five seconds. NJI claims to have experienced a sizable increase in sales, some eighteen percent, as a result of these more frequent copy changes.</p>\n<p>On October 13, Concord's code administrator denied NJI's application because the proposed EMC would violate Concord's regulations. On October 25, NJI sought declaratory and injunctive relief and damages in federal district court, claiming that Concord's regulations impermissibly infringed its First Amendment rights. NJI also sought a preliminary injunction to allow it to install an EMC in time for the holiday shopping season.</p>\n<p>A magistrate judge denied NJI's request for a preliminary injunction on November 22, 2006. The district court denied the injunction on different analytical grounds on June 25, 2007, The district court held inapplicable the commercial speech test in <i>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission,</i> 447 U.S. 557, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980), on which the\" magistrate judge had relied, because the EMC ban is content-neutral and does not apply merely to commercial entities.<sup>[1]</sup> Rather, the district court upheld the ordinance under the rule that content-neutral regulations are constitutional provided that they are narrowly tailored, to serve a significant governmental interest and allow for reasonable alternative channels of communication. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gun Owners' Action League, Inc. v. Swift,</i> 284 F.3d 198, 212 (1st Cir.2002). The district court concluded that NJI had not shown that it was likely to succeed on the merits and therefore was not entitled to a preliminary injunction. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> II.</h2>\n<p>Appellate review of the denial of a preliminary injunction is for abuse of discretion. <i>Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc. v. Rullan,</i> 397 F.3d 56, 68 (1st Cir.2005). The district court correctly noted the four factors considered in determining whether a preliminary injunction ought to issue: \"1) a likelihood of success on the merits, 2) irreparable harm to the plaintiff should preliminary relief not be granted, 3) whether the harm to the defendant from granting the preliminary relief exceeds the harm to the plaintiff from denying it, and 4) the effect of the preliminary injunction on the public interest.\" <i>Id.</i> at 75.</p>\n<p>We consider whether NJI has demonstrated a probability of success on the merits: When considering First Amendment claims, we engage in de novo review of the district court's conclusions of law and mixed questions of law and fact. <i>Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Group of Boston,</i> 515 U.S. 557, 567, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995); <i>Sullivan v. Town of Augusta,</i> 511 F.3d 16, 24-25 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Billboards and other signs are protected by the First Amendment, but courts have long approved subjecting them to the police powers of local government. <i>Prime Media, Inc. v. City Of Brentwood,</i> 398 F.3d 814, 818 (6th Cir.2005). As the Supreme Court has noted, \"signs take up space and may obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. It is common ground that governments may regulate the physical characteristics of signs. . . .\" <i>City of Ladue v. Gilleo,</i> 512 U.S. 43, 48, 114 S.Ct. 2038, 129 L.Ed.2d 36 (1994).</p>\n<p>A threshold question in cases involving challenges to government restrictions on speech is whether the restriction at issue is content-neutral or, to the contrary, is content-based. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC,</i> 512 U.S. 622, 642, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994); <i>Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,</i> 43 F.3d 731, 736 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see also</i> K. Sullivan &amp; G. Gunther, <i>First Amendment Law</i> 193 (1999). In <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> this court held that the \"principal inquiry in determining content neutrality . . . is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\" 100 F.3d at 183 (quoting <i>Nat'l Amusements,</i> 43 F.3d at 737) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, \"[a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>As the district court correctly noted, Concord's prohibition on EMCs does not discriminate based on content. EMCs might communicate any number of messages from a business advertising a sale to a high school congratulating its victorious teamsand all EMCs are similarly prohibited.</p>\n<p>NJI insists that Concord's regulation is content-based because city officials gave preference to time, date, and temperature messages in its prior ordinance. They assert Concord is using the current regulation as a stopgap measure, with plans to reinstate the original prohibitionwith exceptions for time, date, and temperature displaysfollowing the state Supreme Court's decision. This argument goes nowhere. The regulation currently in place, which is the only one before us, contains no exceptions. Concord's regulation is properly analyzed as a content-neutral restriction on speech.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> NJI argues that the city bears the burden of proof on all issues. The district court accepted this argument, at least on the ultimate question of the statute's constitutionality, citing to <i>Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union,</i> 542 U.S. 656, 666, 124 S.Ct. 2783, 159 L.Ed.2d 690 (2004). <i>Ashcroft,</i> however, involved a challenge to a content-based speech restriction. <i>See id.</i> at 665, 124 S.Ct. 2783. Content-based regulations are presumed to be unconstitutional and the government bears a heavy burden of justification. <i>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,</i> 505 U.S. 377, 382, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992); <i>McGuire v. Reilly,</i> 260 F.3d 36, 43 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Here, plaintiff has brought a facial attack on a content-neutral ordinance. In a facial attack case, it is plaintiff's burden to show that the law has no constitutional application. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gonzales v. Carhart,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1610, 1639, 167 L.Ed.2d 480 (2007); <i>N.Y. State Club Ass'n v. City of New York,</i> 487 U.S. 1, 11, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988); <i>McGuire,</i> 260 F.3d at 47.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has said that when the government \"seeks to restrict speech based on its content\" that \"the usual presumption of constitutionality afforded [legislative] enactments is reversed.\" <i>United. States v. Playboy Entm't Group,</i> 529 U.S. 803, 817, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000). The implication is that content-neutral statutes continue to enjoy a presumption of constitutionality.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's most recent case on content-neutral regulations is <i>Hill v. Colorado</i><i>.</i> Neither <i>Hill</i> nor <i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism</i> explicitly speaks to burdens of proof on the different portions of the test used to assess content-neutral regulations. But there is other law saying, in content-neutral regulation cases, but often citing to content-based cases, that the government must show that it has met the element, within the larger test, that the regulation is narrowly tailored. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Turner Broad.,</i> 512 U.S. at 665, 114 S.Ct. 2445; <i>Casey v. City of Newport,</i> 308 F.3d 106, 111 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>We need not resolve here the intricacies of burdens of proof and production. For our purposes, and indeed in many First Amendment cases of content-neutral regulations, the issue of who has the burden of proof will not be important. After all, the government's purpose for the regulation is often expressly stated, as are the reasons for that choice and not others, thus removing those issues from having to be proven. In this case, no matter who has the burden as to which elements of the test, plaintiff's claim fails.</p>\n<p>NJI also argues that it is does not matter whether Concord's regulations are content-neutral or content-based because \"the targeted speech is primarily commercial\" and <i>Central Hudson</i> applies to all restrictions involving commercial speech. This is simply incorrect. <i>Central Hudson</i> serves as an alternative to the more exacting standards applied to content-based restrictions an non-commercial speech. <i>See </i><i>Central Hudson,</i> 447 U.S. at 562-63, 100 S.Ct. 2343; Sullivan &amp; Gunther, <i>supra,</i> at 163, 177-78. The standards for content-neutral restrictions do not vary by whether the plaintiff is exercising commercial speech. The uniform case law on restrictions on signs is clear on this point. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Prime Media,</i> 398 F.3d at 819-22 (evaluating content-neutral restrictions on billboards using narrow tailoring analysis); <i>Messer v. City of Douglasville,</i> 975 F.2d 1505, 1509-11 (11th Cir.1992) (same).</p>\n<p>Content-neutral regulations are permissible so, long as they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and allow for reasonable alternative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> channels of communication. The narrow tailoring test is a form of intermediate scrutiny. \"[R]egulations that are unrelated to the content of speech are subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny. . . . <i>Turner Broad.,</i> 512 U.S. at 642, 114 S.Ct. 2445; <i>see also </i><i>Sullivan,</i> 511 F.3d at 32-33 (same); Sullivan &amp; Gunther, <i>supra,</i> at 199 (same).</p>\n<p>Concord's ordinance satisfies the requirements for constitutionality. The ordinance is a content-neutral regulation, it serves substantial governmental interests, it is narrowly tailored, and it leaves open reasonable alternative channels of communication.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Governmental Interests</i></p>\n<p>From the face of Concord's sign regulations, the city's stated goals include promoting both traffic safety and community aesthetics. If a regulation is content-neutral on its face and states its purposes, we look to the legislative body's statement of intent. \"We will not look behind th[e] express statement of intent as to a law neutral on its face.\" <i>Torres Rivera v. Caldern Serra,</i> 412 F.3d 205, 211 (1st Cir. 2005). It is problematic to permit a plaintiff, in a content-neutral case, to attempt to prove that there, is an intent apart from this express statement because \"the legislature's subjective intent, is both unknown and unknowable.\" <i>McGuire,</i> 260 F.3d at 47. Because Concord's regulations are content-neutral on their face, it was an empty exercise for plaintiff to have conducted examinations of Concord's mayor or code' enforcement officer in an effort to show the stated reasons for the ordinance were not the real reasons. Legislative history is permissible for other purposes, but not this. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McGuire,</i> 260 F.3d at 48 (considering legislative history in determining whether a statute was narrowly tailored).</p>\n<p>Both traffic safety and community aesthetics have long been recognized to constitute significant governmental interests. <i>Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego,</i> 453 U.S. 490, 507-08, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (plurality opinion) (collecting cases and concluding that there can be no \"substantial doubt that the twin goals that the ordinance seeks to furthertraffic safety and the appearance of the cityare substantial governmental goals\"); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc.,</i> 507 U.S. 410, 425, 113 S.Ct. 1505, 123 L.Ed.2d 99 (1993) (acknowledging city's legitimate interest in the aesthetics of its sidewalks); <i>Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers, for Vincent,</i> 466 U.S. 789, 807, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984) (\"[T]he visual assault on the citizens of Los Angeles . . . constitutes a significant substantive evil within the City's power to prohibit.\"). Concord's stated justifications plainly constitute significant governmental interests.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Narrow Tailoring, but Not Least Restrictive Means</i></p>\n<p>NJI argues that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored. In determining whether a provision is narrowly tailored, courts apply the test articulated in <i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism</i> and reiterated by the Supreme Court in <i>Hill v. Colorado</i><i>.</i> Under <i>Ward,</i> \"the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied `so long as the . . . regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.'\" 491 U.S. at 799, 109 S.Ct. 2746 (quoting <i>United States v. Albertini,</i> 472 U.S. 675, 689, 105 S.Ct. 2897, 86 L.Ed.2d 536 (1985)). \"[T]his standard does not mean that a . . . regulation may burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests.\" <i>Id.</i> Concord, however, is not required to choose the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> least restrictive means possible: \"[T]he regulation will not be invalid simply because a court concludes that the government's interest could be adequately served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative.\" <i>Id.</i> at 800, 109 S.Ct. 2746.</p>\n<p>Concord's interests in traffic safety and community aesthetics would be achieved less effectively without the ordinance's prohibition on EMCs. We give some respect to \"the accumulated, common-sense judgments of local lawmakers and of the many reviewing courts that billboards' are real and substantial hazards to traffic safety.\" <i>Metromedia,</i> 453 U.S. at 509, 101 S.Ct. 2882 (plurality opinion). It is given that a billboard can constitute a traffic hazard. It follows that EMCs, which provide more visual stimuli than traditional signs, logically will be more distracting and more hazardous. <i>See Chapin Furniture Outlet, Inc. v. Town of Chapin,</i> 2006 WL 2711851, at *4 (D.S.C. Sept.20, 2006), <i>vacated on other grounds by Chapin Furniture Outlet, Inc. v. Town of Chapin,</i> 2007 WL 3193854 (4th Cir. Oct.30, 2007) (holding, in the context of EMC regulations, that \"the Town's judgment that flashing or scrolling signs constitute a traffic hazard . . . is not unreasonable\"). Indeed, plaintiff's own witness stated that bypassers focus more on rapidly blinking electronic signs than static signs. This constitutes a greater hazard. Further, for drivers a flashing light is often a signal of hazard on the roadway, a signal which itself slows and disrupts the traffic flow.</p>\n<p>NJI argues that Concord must perform studies to prove that the ban on EMCs in fact supports its stated interests. Concord was under, no obligation to do such studies or put them into evidence. Justice Brennan suggested the need for such evidence in his concurring opinion in <i>Metromedia,</i> but seven justices rejected his position. <i>Metromedia,</i> 453 U.S. at 521, 528, 101 S.Ct. 2882 (Brennan, J., concurring); <i>see also </i><i>Outdoor Sys. Inc. v. City of Lenexa,</i> 67 F.Supp.2d 1231, 1238 (D.Kan. 1999) (\"Relying on Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in <i>Metromedia,</i> plaintiff claims that the City has the burden to come forward with evidence which demonstrates that billboards actually impair traffic safety and the beauty of the environment. Plaintiff ignores the fact that seven Justices rejected Justice Brennan's analysis in this regard.\").</p>\n<p>As noted in <i>Ackerley Communications of Northwest Inc. v. Krochalis,</i> 108 F.3d 1095, 1099-1100 (9th Cir.1997), \"[a]s a matter of law Seattle's ordinance, enacted to further the city's interests in esthetics and safety, is a constitutional restriction on commercial speech without detailed proof that the billboard regulation will in fact advance the city's interests.\" Similarly, the Sixth Circuit observed in rejecting the argument that a city needed to produce evidence to justify its regulation on billboard size: \"To ask the City to justify a size restriction of 120 square feet over, say, 200 square feet or 300 square feet would impose great costs on local governments. . . .\" <i>Prime Media,</i> 398 F.3d at 823-24.</p>\n<p>Courts have \"repeatedly deferred to the aesthetic judgments of municipalities and other government bodies when evaluating restrictions on protected expression.\" <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> 100 F.3d at 190 (quoting <i>Gold Coast Pub'ns, Inc. v. Corrigan,</i> 42 F.3d 1336, 1346 (11th Cir.1994)) (internal quotation mark omitted). Although courts do not wholly defer to legislative judgments, <i>see id.,</i> there is no basis to doubt that Concord's aesthetic concern\"not rendering [its] visual image and community character to be that of a potential Times Square\"would be achieved far, less effectively absent a ban on EMCs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> Concord's ordinance also does not burden substantially more speech than necessary. NJI argues that because Concord's City Council considered but rejected alternatives to a complete ban on EMCs, the ban necessarily burdens too much speech because there are alternatives. However, the government is not required to choose the least restrictive approach in content-neutral regulation. In <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> this court held that a regulation banning newspaper distribution boxes from the public streets of Boston's historic Beacon Hill district passed constitutional muster. 100 F.3d at 195. The opinion noted that although less restrictive alternatives existed, the regulating commission was not required to adopt them if they would serve its interests less effectively. <i>Id.</i> at 189-90. NJI, to its credit, concedes this is the rule of <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> but asks us to overrule the case. Not only do we, as a panel, lack the power to do so, <i>Irving v. United States,</i> 162 F.3d 154, 160 (1st Cir.1998), but we would not, even if we could, for the rule is correct.</p>\n<p>Here, the city argues that NJI's proposed less restrictive alternatives were problematic and it was not required to accept them. Ironically, NJI argues less than a total ban would be a less restrictive alternative. The city had tried such an ordinancean EMC ban allowing only time, date, and temperature displaysbefore and was met with a lawsuit. The alternative of allowing EMCs but imposing certain conditions on them, such as limiting the number of times per day a message could change, would have created steep monitoring costs and other complications for the city. There is evidence in the record, permissible on this issue, that the city explicitly considered and rejected alternatives, and the reasons for its choice. <i>See </i><i>McGuire,</i> 260 F.3d at 49. Concord's concerns about the proposed alternatives to its present EMC ordinance are legitimate.</p>\n<p>NJI makes a separate argument that Concord's ordinance is forbidden because it is a ban of an entire medium of communication. Factually the argument raises the issue of how one defines \"medium.\" Legally, the principle is untenable here.<sup>[2]</sup> Billboards and signs are not banned, nor is the use of signs with manually changeable type. Even if EMCs are considered to be a particular \"medium,\" the fact that a regulation bans a particular medium does not mean that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored. <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> 100 F.3d at 191-92. When the medium itself is the \"evil the city [seeks] to address,\" then a ban of that entire medium is narrowly tailored. <i>Id.</i> at 192 (citing <i>Vincent,</i> 466 U.S. at 810, 104 S.Ct. 2118).</p>\n<p>As the Supreme Court observed in <i>Metromedia,</i> \"if the city has a sufficient basis for believing that billboards are traffic hazards and are unattractive, then obviously the most direct and perhaps the only effective approach to solving the problems they create is to prohibit them.\" 453 U.S. at 508, 101 S.Ct. 2882 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>C. <i>Alternative Channels</i></p>\n<p>Concord has not foreclosed NJI from using other means of communication. As the district court pointed out, NJI can still use static and manually changeable signs, It can also place advertisements in newspapers and magazines and on television and the Internet, distribute flyers, circulate direct mailings, and engage in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> cross-promotions with other retailers. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sullivan,</i> 511 F.3d at 43-44 (holding that the use of sidewalks, gatherings on state land, hand-held banners, leafleting, vehicular processions, and smaller scale outdoor gatherings constituted sufficient alternatives for people unable to afford a city's parade permit); <i>La Tour v. City of Fayetteville,</i> 442 F.3d 1094, 1097 (8th Cir.2006) (concluding that an ordinance prohibiting flashing or blinking electronic signs left open sufficient alternative channels of communication, including using non-electronic signs); <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> 100 F.3d at 193 (concluding that street vendors were an adequate alternative to on-street newspaper boxes); <i>Chapin Furniture Outlet,</i> 2006 WL 2711851, at *4 (holding that an ordinance banning EMCs \"does not prevent [p]laintiff from displaying any message . . . on a sign not prohibited\" and noting that plaintiff could use banners, flags, sandwich boards, and inflatable signs as alternatives to EMCs).</p>\n<p>NJI argues that it is losing potential customers, and therefore profit, because of its inability to place an EMC at its Concord location. The maximizing of profit is not the animating concern of the First Amendment. The fact that restrictions prohibit a form of speech attractive to plaintiff does not mean that no reasonable alternative channels of communication are available. \"The First Amendment does not guarantee a right to the most cost-effective means of [speech]. . . .\" <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> 100 F.3d at 198. Indeed, we have \"upheld alternative means of communication despite diminution in the quantity of speech, a ban on a preferred method of communication, and a reduction in the potential audience.\" <i>Sullivan,</i> 511 F.3d at 43.</p>\n<p>Concord's prohibition of EMCs is a constitutionally permissible content-neutral regulation. Since NJI has no probability of success on the merits of its claim, we need not address the other factors in the preliminary injunction determination.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Costs are awarded to defendants.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The commercial speech framework is \"substantially similar\" to the test for time, place, and manner restrictions. <i>Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly,</i> 533 U.S. 525, 554, 121 S.Ct. 2404, 150 L.Ed.2d 532 (2001) (quoting <i>Bd. of Trs. of State Univ. of N.Y. v.

Concord's ordinance meets these criteria and we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Concord has enacted sign ordinances as part of its municipal code. The stated purposes of these ordinances are, among other things, to \"[m]aintain and enhance the appearance and aesthetic environment of the City\" and to \"[i]mprove pedestrian and traffic safety.\" Concord, N.H., Code of Ordinances § 28-6-1(b) &amp; (d) (2007).</p>\n<p>Before 2006, Concord's sign ordinances contained prohibitions on EMCs, but provided exceptions for EMCs which displayed solely time, date, and temperature indicators. In 2005, a New Hampshire Superior Court judge ruled that the regulations violated the First Amendment because they favored signs that displayed time, date, or temperature. That erroneous ruling has since been overruled by the New Hampshire Supreme Court. <i>Carlson's Chrysler v. City of Concord,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1440664\"><a href=\"/opinion/1440664/carlsons-chrysler-v-city-of-concord/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 70-71 (N.H. 2007).</p>\n<p>In light of the interim Superior Court ruling, Concord amended its ordinances in August 2006 to prohibit all EMCs, including ones indicating only time, date, or temperature. The city's current ordinance, challenged here, prohibits all signs that \"appear animated or projected\" or \"are intermittently or intensely illuminated or of a traveling, tracing, scrolling, or sequential light type\" or \"contain or are illuminated by animated or flashing light.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> Concord, N.H., Code of Ordinances § 28-6-7(h) (2007).</p>\n<p>On October 3, 2006, NJI sought permission to construct and operate an EMC on the premises of its retail store in Concord. The sign would be located on Loudon Road, a high-traffic corridor that includes a mix of retail and residential development and a large public park and fire station. The location is in close proximity to an elementary school and more residential neighborhoods. The store's current sign is a freestanding sign six feet off the ground that features a model of a large gold ring with a polished diamond and text reading \"Joseph Michaels Diamonds.\" (Joseph Michaels Diamonds is a trade name used by NJI.) The proposed EMC would be located directly underneath the current sign and would measure 2.7 feet by 5.3 feet.</p>\n<p>NJI is eager to install an EMC at its store in Concord because of its experience with an EMC at another retail location in Dover, New Hampshire. NJI had earlier installed an EMC at its Dover store. Originally, NJI changed the copy on its EMC only once every ten minutes. Early in 2006, NJI began changing the text once every four to five seconds. NJI claims to have experienced a sizable increase in sales, some eighteen percent, as a result of these more frequent copy changes.</p>\n<p>On October 13, Concord's code administrator denied NJI's application because the proposed EMC would violate Concord's regulations. On October 25, NJI sought declaratory and injunctive relief and damages in federal district court, claiming that Concord's regulations impermissibly infringed its First Amendment rights. NJI also sought a preliminary injunction to allow it to install an EMC in time for the holiday shopping season.</p>\n<p>A magistrate judge denied NJI's request for a preliminary injunction on November 22, 2006. The district court denied the injunction on different analytical grounds on June 25, 2007, The district court held inapplicable the commercial speech test in <i>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span> (2000). The implication is that content-neutral statutes continue to enjoy a presumption of constitutionality.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's most recent case on content-neutral regulations is <i>Hill v. Colorado</i><i>.</i> Neither <i>Hill</i> nor <i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism</i> explicitly speaks to burdens of proof on the different portions of the test used to assess content-neutral regulations. But there is other law saying, in content-neutral regulation cases, but often citing to content-based cases, that the government must show that it has met the element, within the larger test, that the regulation is narrowly tailored. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Turner Broad.,</i> 512 U.S. at 665, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117869\"><a href=\"/opinion/117869/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For our purposes, and indeed in many First Amendment cases of content-neutral regulations, the issue of who has the burden of proof will not be important. After all, the government's purpose for the regulation is often expressly stated, as are the reasons for that choice and not others, thus removing those issues from having to be proven. In this case, no matter who has the burden as to which elements of the test, plaintiff's claim fails.</p>\n<p>NJI also argues that it is does not matter whether Concord's regulations are content-neutral or content-based because \"the targeted speech is primarily commercial\" and <i>Central Hudson</i> applies to all restrictions involving commercial speech. This is simply incorrect. <i>Central Hudson</i> serves as an alternative to the more exacting standards applied to content-based restrictions an non-commercial speech. <i>See </i><i>Central Hudson,</i> 447 U.S. at 562-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110312\"><a href=\"/opinion/110312/central-hudson-gas-elec-corp-v-public-serv-commn-of-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2343</span></a></span>; Sullivan &amp; Gunther, <i>supra,</i> at 163, 177-78. The standards for content-neutral restrictions do not vary by whether the plaintiff is exercising commercial speech. The uniform case law on restrictions on signs is clear on this point. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Prime Media,</i> 398 F.3d at 819-22 (evaluating content-neutral restrictions on billboards using narrow tailoring analysis); <i>Messer v.

The narrow tailoring test is a form of intermediate scrutiny. \"[R]egulations that are unrelated to the content of speech are subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny. . . . <i>Turner Broad.,</i> 512 U.S. at 642, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117869\"><a href=\"/opinion/117869/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The ordinance is a content-neutral regulation, it serves substantial governmental interests, it is narrowly tailored, and it leaves open reasonable alternative channels of communication.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Governmental Interests</i></p>\n<p>From the face of Concord's sign regulations, the city's stated goals include promoting both traffic safety and community aesthetics. If a regulation is content-neutral on its face and states its purposes, we look to the legislative body's statement of intent. \"We will not look behind th[e] express statement of intent as to a law neutral on its face.\" <i>Torres Rivera v.

It is problematic to permit a plaintiff, in a content-neutral case, to attempt to prove that there, is an intent apart from this express statement because \"the legislature's subjective intent, is both unknown and unknowable.\" <i>McGuire,</i> 260 F.3d at 47. Because Concord's regulations are content-neutral on their face, it was an empty exercise for plaintiff to have conducted examinations of Concord's mayor or code' enforcement officer in an effort to show the stated reasons for the ordinance were not the real reasons. Legislative history is permissible for other purposes, but not this. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McGuire,</i> 260 F.3d at 48 (considering legislative history in determining whether a statute was narrowly tailored).</p>\n<p>Both traffic safety and community aesthetics have long been recognized to constitute significant governmental interests. <i>Metromedia, Inc. v.

It follows that EMCs, which provide more visual stimuli than traditional signs, logically will be more distracting and more hazardous. <i>See Chapin Furniture Outlet, Inc. v.

Krochalis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737485\"><a href=\"/opinion/737485/97-cal-daily-op-serv-1728-97-daily-journal-dar-3259-ackerley/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></a></span>, 1099-1100 (9th Cir.1997), \"[a]s a matter of law Seattle's ordinance, enacted to further the city's interests in esthetics and safety, is a constitutional restriction on commercial speech without detailed proof that the billboard regulation will in fact advance the city's interests.\" Similarly, the Sixth Circuit observed in rejecting the argument that a city needed to produce evidence to justify its regulation on billboard size: \"To ask the City to justify a size restriction of 120 square feet over, say, 200 square feet or 300 square feet would impose great costs on local governments. . . .\" <i>Prime Media,</i> 398 F.3d at 823-24.</p>\n<p>Courts have \"repeatedly deferred to the aesthetic judgments of municipalities and other government bodies when evaluating restrictions on protected expression.\" <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> 100 F.3d at 190 (quoting <i>Gold Coast Pub'ns, Inc. v. Corrigan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684427\"><a href=\"/opinion/684427/gold-coast-publications-incorporated-a-delaware-corporation-dba-exito/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1336</span></a></span>, 1346 (11th Cir.1994)) (internal quotation mark omitted). Although courts do not wholly defer to legislative judgments, <i>see id.,</i> there is no basis to doubt that Concord's aesthetic concern\"not rendering [its] visual image and community character to be that of a potential Times Square\"would be achieved far, less effectively absent a ban on EMCs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> Concord's ordinance also does not burden substantially more speech than necessary. NJI argues that because Concord's City Council considered but rejected alternatives to a complete ban on EMCs, the ban necessarily burdens too much speech because there are alternatives. However, the government is not required to choose the least restrictive approach in content-neutral regulation. In <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> this court held that a regulation banning newspaper distribution boxes from the public streets of Boston's historic Beacon Hill district passed constitutional muster. 100 F.3d at 195. The opinion noted that although less restrictive alternatives existed, the regulating commission was not required to adopt them if they would serve its interests less effectively. <i>Id.</i> at 189-90. NJI, to its credit, concedes this is the rule of <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> but asks us to overrule the case. Not only do we, as a panel, lack the power to do so, <i>Irving v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759695\"><a href=\"/opinion/759695/gail-merchant-irving-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 160 (1st Cir.1998), but we would not, even if we could, for the rule is correct.</p>\n<p>Here, the city argues that NJI's proposed less restrictive alternatives were problematic and it was not required to accept them. Ironically, NJI argues less than a total ban would be a less restrictive alternative. The city had tried such an ordinancean EMC ban allowing only time, date, and temperature displaysbefore and was met with a lawsuit. The alternative of allowing EMCs but imposing certain conditions on them, such as limiting the number of times per day a message could change, would have created steep monitoring costs and other complications for the city. There is evidence in the record, permissible on this issue, that the city explicitly considered and rejected alternatives, and the reasons for its choice. <i>See </i><i>McGuire,</i> 260 F.3d at 49. Concord's concerns about the proposed alternatives to its present EMC ordinance are legitimate.</p>\n<p>NJI makes a separate argument that Concord's ordinance is forbidden because it is a ban of an entire medium of communication. Factually the argument raises the issue of how one defines \"medium.\" Legally, the principle is untenable here.<sup>[2]</sup> Billboards and signs are not banned, nor is the use of signs with manually changeable type. Even if EMCs are considered to be a particular \"medium,\" the fact that a regulation bans a particular medium does not mean that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored. <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> 100 F.3d at 191-92. When the medium itself is the \"evil the city [seeks] to address,\" then a ban of that entire medium is narrowly tailored. <i>Id.</i> at 192 (citing <i>Vincent,</i> 466 U.S. at 810, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111175\"><a href=\"/opinion/111175/members-of-city-council-of-los-angeles-v-taxpayers-for-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2118</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>As the Supreme Court observed in <i>Metromedia,</i> \"if the city has a sufficient basis for believing that billboards are traffic hazards and are unattractive, then obviously the most direct and perhaps the only effective approach to solving the problems they create is to prohibit them.\" 453 U.S. at 508, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110561\"><a href=\"/opinion/110561/metromedia-inc-v-san-diego/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2882</span></a></span> (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>C. <i>Alternative Channels</i></p>\n<p>Concord has not foreclosed NJI from using other means of communication. As the district court pointed out, NJI can still use static and manually changeable signs, It can also place advertisements in newspapers and magazines and on television and the Internet, distribute flyers, circulate direct mailings, and engage in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> cross-promotions with other retailers. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sullivan,</i> 511 F.3d at 43-44 (holding that the use of sidewalks, gatherings on state land, hand-held banners, leafleting, vehicular processions, and smaller scale outdoor gatherings constituted sufficient alternatives for people unable to afford a city's parade permit); <i>La Tour v. City of Fayetteville,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793838\"><a href=\"/opinion/793838/john-s-la-tour-v-city-of-fayetteville-arkansas-brandt-warwick-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span>, 1097 (8th Cir.2006) (concluding that an ordinance prohibiting flashing or blinking electronic signs left open sufficient alternative channels of communication, including using non-electronic signs); <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> 100 F.3d at 193 (concluding that street vendors were an adequate alternative to on-street newspaper boxes); <i>Chapin Furniture Outlet,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2711851</span></span>, at *4 (holding that an ordinance banning EMCs \"does not prevent [p]laintiff from displaying any message . . . on a sign not prohibited\" and noting that plaintiff could use banners, flags, sandwich boards, and inflatable signs as alternatives to EMCs).</p>\n<p>NJI argues that it is losing potential customers, and therefore profit, because of its inability to place an EMC at its Concord location. The maximizing of profit is not the animating concern of the First Amendment. The fact that restrictions prohibit a form of speech attractive to plaintiff does not mean that no reasonable alternative channels of communication are available. \"The First Amendment does not guarantee a right to the most cost-effective means of [speech]. . . .\" <i>Globe Newspaper,</i> 100 F.3d at 198. Indeed, we have \"upheld alternative means of communication despite diminution in the quantity of speech, a ban on a preferred method of communication, and a reduction in the potential audience.\" <i>Sullivan,</i> 511 F.3d at 43.</p>\n<p>Concord's prohibition of EMCs is a constitutionally permissible content-neutral regulation. Since NJI has no probability of success on the merits of its claim, we need not address the other factors in the preliminary injunction determination.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Costs are awarded to defendants.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The commercial speech framework is \"substantially similar\" to the test for time, place, and manner restrictions. <i>Lorillard Tobacco Co. v.
