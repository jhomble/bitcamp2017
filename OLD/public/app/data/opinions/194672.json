See  Newport Plaza Assoc.  v. Durfee Attleboro  Bank,\n                                                                \n\n     F.2d    ,      (1st Cir. 1993),  No. 92-1444, slip  op. at 6\n\n(1st Cir. Feb. 16, 1993).  In 1962,  Herb Ericson, a Bank person-\n\nnel  officer,  hired David  Frankina  as  a Security-Cage  Clerk.\n\nEricson represented  that  Frankina would  have  a job  for  life\n\nunless he committed  a criminal  act against the  Bank.   Ericson\n\nalso told Frankina that  the Bank had never laid  off an employee\n\nin its 200-year history.  Throughout his twenty-seven year tenure\n\nwith  the  Bank, Frankina  became aware  of  no employee  who was\n\nterminated except for criminal conduct.  \n\n          In 1989,  the Bank launched a  large-scale reduction in\n\nits work force due to mounting losses in its Treasury and Banking\n\nServices operation.  The  Bank completely reorganized the Banking\n\nServices component of the department, reconfiguring approximately\n\n252 operational functions into approximately 135 functions.  As a\n\nresult,  119 positions  were  eliminated.   Thomas Keane,  Senior\n\nOperations Manager  of  the Capital  Asset  Services  Department,\n\ndetermined  that it was necessary  to eliminate two  of the seven\n\npositions in the Control Unit to eliminate functional redundancy.\n\n          After  reviewing  recent  employee performance  evalua-\n\ntions, and  based  on his  personal  knowledge of  employee  work\n\nhabits, Keane selected two  Control Unit employees for dismissal:\n\na thirty-five year  old, and Frankina,  then forty-seven.   Keane\n\nconcluded  that the  thirty-five  year old  lacked the  necessary\n\nskills  and had the least  experience, and that  Frankina was the\n\nleast  qualified employee in the Unit.  Keane found that Frankina\n\nhad  relatively  poor  work  habits,  experienced  difficulty  in\n\ncompleting assigned  tasks, and was least  well-suited to perform\n\nthe  work duties in the  reconfigured organization.   Four of the\n\nfive Control Unit  employees who were retained were  younger than\n\nFrankina.1\n\n          On May 19, 1989, Keane  and Gerard Demone, Senior Human\n\nResources Manager, met with Frankina to inform him of the layoff,\n\ndescribe  the  severance  benefits, and  offer  professional job-\n\nsearch assistance.   Demone  told Frankina that  job applications\n\nfrom laid-off employees would  be given preferential treatment in\n\n                    \n\n     1One retained employee was forty-nine  years old at the time\nof the reorganization, two  were forty-one, one was thirty-seven,\nand one  was thirty-one.   Frankina suggests that  the forty-nine\nyear  old was  not  similarly situated  because  he served  in  a\nmanagerial capacity.\n\n                                4\n\nthe  Bank's hiring  process.   Frankina subsequently  applied for\n\nmore than fifty positions with the Bank.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          A  virtual \"carbon  copy\" suit  was brought  by another\n\nformer  Bank employee in Goldman  v.

Thus, we rely  extensively on our  Goldman analysis.  In\n                                                   \n\nGoldman, we  defined the applicable summary  judgment standard as\n\nfollows:\n\n               We review a grant of summary judgment de\n                                                       \n          novo, employing the  same criteria  incumbent\n              \n          upon  the  district court  in  the  first in-\n          stance.

The nonmoving  party \"may  not rest\n          upon the  mere allegations or denials  of the\n          . . .  pleadings, but  . . .  must set  forth\n          specific facts showing that  there is a genu-\n          ine issue for trial.\"  Fed.

As we explained in Goldman:\n                                                        \n\n          First, the plaintiff must make a prima  facie\n          showing of discrimination;  that is,  [Frank-\n          ina]  must  demonstrate that  he  (1) was  at\n          least forty years of age, (2) met the employ-\n          er's legitimate job performance expectations,\n          (3)  experienced  adverse employment  action,\n          and (4) was replaced by a person with roughly\n          equivalent job qualifications.

The  burden of persuasion  remains\n          with the plaintiff-employee at all times.\n\n               The presumption of unlawful age discrim-\n          ination generated by the plaintiff-employee's\n          prima  facie   showing  dissipates,  however,\n          provided  the employer sustains its burden of\n          production; the  plaintiff-employee must then\n          demonstrate that the proffered reason for the\n          adverse employment action  was simply a  pre-\n          text for  age discrimination.   The plaintiff\n          must do  more than cast doubt  on the employ-\n          er's justification for the challenged action;\n          there must be a sufficient  showing that dis-\n          criminatory  animus   motivated  the  action.\n          Direct or indirect evidence of discriminatory\n          motive may  do, but  the evidence as  a whole\n          must be  sufficient  for a  reasonable  fact-\n          finder  to infer that the employer's decision\n          was motivated by age animus.\n\n               Under First Circuit caselaw,  the plain-\n          tiff-employee  must  adduce minimally  suffi-\n          cient evidence of pretext  and discriminatory\n                                        \n          animus.  A showing that the employer's justi-\n          fication  was not  the actual  motive may  be\n          enough if the facts and circumstances raise a\n          reasonable  inference of  age discrimination.\n          Nevertheless,  the plaintiff-employee  cannot\n          avert  summary judgment if  the record is de-\n          void  of  [both]  direct  and  circumstantial\n                                       \n          evidence of discriminatory animus on the part\n          of the employer.\n\nGoldman, slip  op. at 6-8 (internal citations and quotation marks\n       \n\nomitted).\n\n                                7\n\n          It is not disputed that Frankina made out a prima facie\n\nage discrimination claim, nor that the Bank articulated a nondis-\n\ncriminatory motive for Frankina's dismissal,  i.e., that economic\n                                                  \n\nconsiderations necessitated a reduction in force and Frankina was\n\nthe  \"least  qualified employee\"  in his  unit.

The district court acknowledged that Frankina present-\n\ned some evidence to counter the Bank's characterization of him as\n\na poor performer, but  ruled that Frankina presented insufficient\n\nevidence of pretext and  discriminatory animus.  Accordingly, the\n\nBank was awarded summary judgment on Frankina's state and federal\n\nage-discrimination claims.2\n\n                    \n\n     2The complaint  alleged parallel  claims under the  ADEA and\nits  Massachusetts  counterpart,  Mass.

On\nappeal, Frankina  asserts for  the first time  that Massachusetts\napplies  a less onerous standard of proof to claims brought under\nthe Massachusetts statute than this court applies to ADEA claims,\nsee infra  note 4,  and that  his state  claim therefore  must be\n         \naddressed  separately.   However,  Frankina  did not  distinguish\nthese claims  in  his opposition  to  summary judgment,  and  the\ndistrict  court analyzed  them  collectively,  noting  only  that\n\"courts apply the same analysis  to state and federal discrimina-\ntion  claims.\"   We decline  to address  this newfound  claim, as\n\"theories  not raised  squarely in the  district court  cannot be\nsurfaced for the first  time on appeal.\"  McCoy  v.

Frankina contends  that  an  inference  of dis-\n\ncriminatory  animus on  the  part of  the  Bank arises  from  the\n\nfollowing evidence:  Frankina and six other former Bank employees\n\ndismissed  pursuant to  the reduction  in force  were the  oldest\n\nemployees and had the longest service records in their respective\n\nunits;  the termination  of  older, more  costly employees  would\n\noptimize the  cost reductions  achieved through the  reduction in\n\nforce; of the 119 terminated employees, 41% were over forty years\n\nof  age, but  only 24%  of those  subsequently rehired  were over\n\nforty; under  a new  retirement plan  introduced  in 1989,  which\n\nrequired the Bank  annually to  contribute a  percentage of  each\n\nemployee's salary to a \"Cash Balance\" account, the Bank deposited\n\na decreasing percentage of salary to an employee's account as the\n\nemployee reached the  upper service brackets;  and the Bank  dis-\n\n                    \n\n     3Although Frankina  argues  on appeal  that his  performance\nevaluations  in 1987  and  1988 were  equivalent  to those  of  a\nyounger colleague  who was  retained, he waived  the argument  by\nfailing to raise it below.

Breach of Lifetime Employment Contract\n                                          \n\n          Next, Frankina argues that summary judgment was improp-\n\ner on his  claim for  breach of a  lifetime employment  contract.\n\nThe  district  court found  that  Frankina failed  to  generate a\n\n                    \n\n     4Frankina argues  that our cases place a more onerous burden\non an ADEA plaintiff than that envisioned by the Supreme Court in\nMcDonnell Douglas and  Texas Dep't of  Community Affairs v.

We agree.\n\n          Frankina  maintains  that Bank  personnel  officer Herb\n\nEricson offered him lifetime  employment by representing that the\n\nBank had never laid off employees and that Frankina  would have a\n\njob for life unless he committed a criminal act against the Bank.\n\nMoreover,  he  argues, the  concept  of  lifetime employment  was\n\nreinforced throughout his tenure at the Bank as he never  knew of\n\nan  employee being  dismissed except for  criminal conduct.   For\n\npresent purposes,  we  assume, without  deciding, that  Ericson's\n\nrepresentations were  sufficient to  impart an offer  of lifetime\n\nemployment to Frankina.\n\n          As we stated in Goldman, however:\n                                 \n\n          Under Massachusetts law,  a lifetime  employ-\n          ment contract cannot be found absent evidence\n          that it was made or ratified by an officer or\n          agent  with actual  or apparent  authority to\n          bind the  employer  to a  lifetime  contract.\n          See Rydman  v.

As  a personnel  officer,  Ericson undoubtedly  had\n\nactual  or  apparent authority  to  hire Bank  employees.   Under\n\nMassachusetts law, however, ordinary  authority to hire is insuf-\n\nficient to  bind an employer  to a lifetime  employment contract.\n\nId.  at 18-19 (citing  cases).

In 1962,  Herb Ericson, a Bank person-\n\nnel  officer,  hired David  Frankina  as  a Security-Cage  Clerk.\n\nEricson represented  that  Frankina would  have  a job  for  life\n\nunless he committed  a criminal  act against the  Bank.   Ericson\n\nalso told Frankina that  the Bank had never laid  off an employee\n\nin its 200-year history.  Throughout his twenty-seven year tenure\n\nwith  the  Bank, Frankina  became aware  of  no employee  who was\n\nterminated except for criminal conduct.  \n\n          In 1989,  the Bank launched a  large-scale reduction in\n\nits work force due to mounting losses in its Treasury and Banking\n\nServices operation.  The  Bank completely reorganized the Banking\n\nServices component of the department, reconfiguring approximately\n\n252 operational functions into approximately 135 functions.  As a\n\nresult,  119 positions  were  eliminated.   Thomas Keane,  Senior\n\nOperations Manager  of  the Capital  Asset  Services  Department,\n\ndetermined  that it was necessary  to eliminate two  of the seven\n\npositions in the Control Unit to eliminate functional redundancy.\n\n          After  reviewing  recent  employee performance  evalua-\n\ntions, and  based  on his  personal  knowledge of  employee  work\n\nhabits, Keane selected two  Control Unit employees for dismissal:\n\na thirty-five year  old, and Frankina,  then forty-seven.   Keane\n\nconcluded  that the  thirty-five  year old  lacked the  necessary\n\nskills  and had the least  experience, and that  Frankina was the\n\nleast  qualified employee in the Unit.  Keane found that Frankina\n\nhad  relatively  poor  work  habits,  experienced  difficulty  in\n\ncompleting assigned  tasks, and was least  well-suited to perform\n\nthe  work duties in the  reconfigured organization.   Four of the\n\nfive Control Unit  employees who were retained were  younger than\n\nFrankina.1\n\n          On May 19, 1989, Keane  and Gerard Demone, Senior Human\n\nResources Manager, met with Frankina to inform him of the layoff,\n\ndescribe  the  severance  benefits, and  offer  professional job-\n\nsearch assistance.   Demone  told Frankina that  job applications\n\nfrom laid-off employees would  be given preferential treatment in\n\n                    \n\n     1One retained employee was forty-nine  years old at the time\nof the reorganization, two  were forty-one, one was thirty-seven,\nand one  was thirty-one.   Frankina suggests that  the forty-nine\nyear  old was  not  similarly situated  because  he served  in  a\nmanagerial capacity.\n\n                                4\n\nthe  Bank's hiring  process.   Frankina subsequently  applied for\n\nmore than fifty positions with the Bank.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          A  virtual \"carbon  copy\" suit  was brought  by another\n\nformer  Bank employee in Goldman  v.

The  burden of persuasion  remains\n          with the plaintiff-employee at all times.\n\n               The presumption of unlawful age discrim-\n          ination generated by the plaintiff-employee's\n          prima  facie   showing  dissipates,  however,\n          provided  the employer sustains its burden of\n          production; the  plaintiff-employee must then\n          demonstrate that the proffered reason for the\n          adverse employment action  was simply a  pre-\n          text for  age discrimination.   The plaintiff\n          must do  more than cast doubt  on the employ-\n          er's justification for the challenged action;\n          there must be a sufficient  showing that dis-\n          criminatory  animus   motivated  the  action.\n          Direct or indirect evidence of discriminatory\n          motive may  do, but  the evidence as  a whole\n          must be  sufficient  for a  reasonable  fact-\n          finder  to infer that the employer's decision\n          was motivated by age animus.\n\n               Under First Circuit caselaw,  the plain-\n          tiff-employee  must  adduce minimally  suffi-\n          cient evidence of pretext  and discriminatory\n                                        \n          animus.  A showing that the employer's justi-\n          fication  was not  the actual  motive may  be\n          enough if the facts and circumstances raise a\n          reasonable  inference of  age discrimination.\n          Nevertheless,  the plaintiff-employee  cannot\n          avert  summary judgment if  the record is de-\n          void  of  [both]  direct  and  circumstantial\n                                       \n          evidence of discriminatory animus on the part\n          of the employer.\n\nGoldman, slip  op. at 6-8 (internal citations and quotation marks\n       \n\nomitted).\n\n                                7\n\n          It is not disputed that Frankina made out a prima facie\n\nage discrimination claim, nor that the Bank articulated a nondis-\n\ncriminatory motive for Frankina's dismissal,  i.e., that economic\n                                                  \n\nconsiderations necessitated a reduction in force and Frankina was\n\nthe  \"least  qualified employee\"  in his  unit.   The  dispute on\n\nappeal  centers  on  the third  stage  of  the  McDonnell Douglas\n                                                                 \n\nanalysis.  The district court acknowledged that Frankina present-\n\ned some evidence to counter the Bank's characterization of him as\n\na poor performer, but  ruled that Frankina presented insufficient\n\nevidence of pretext and  discriminatory animus.  Accordingly, the\n\nBank was awarded summary judgment on Frankina's state and federal\n\nage-discrimination claims.2\n\n                    \n\n     2The complaint  alleged parallel  claims under the  ADEA and\nits  Massachusetts  counterpart,  Mass.

On\nappeal, Frankina  asserts for  the first time  that Massachusetts\napplies  a less onerous standard of proof to claims brought under\nthe Massachusetts statute than this court applies to ADEA claims,\nsee infra  note 4,  and that  his state  claim therefore  must be\n         \naddressed  separately.   However,  Frankina  did not  distinguish\nthese claims  in  his opposition  to  summary judgment,  and  the\ndistrict  court analyzed  them  collectively,  noting  only  that\n\"courts apply the same analysis  to state and federal discrimina-\ntion  claims.\"   We decline  to address  this newfound  claim, as\n\"theories  not raised  squarely in the  district court  cannot be\nsurfaced for the first  time on appeal.\"  McCoy  v.

Frankina contends  that  an  inference  of dis-\n\ncriminatory  animus on  the  part of  the  Bank arises  from  the\n\nfollowing evidence:  Frankina and six other former Bank employees\n\ndismissed  pursuant to  the reduction  in force  were the  oldest\n\nemployees and had the longest service records in their respective\n\nunits;  the termination  of  older, more  costly employees  would\n\noptimize the  cost reductions  achieved through the  reduction in\n\nforce; of the 119 terminated employees, 41% were over forty years\n\nof  age, but  only 24%  of those  subsequently rehired  were over\n\nforty; under  a new  retirement plan  introduced  in 1989,  which\n\nrequired the Bank  annually to  contribute a  percentage of  each\n\nemployee's salary to a \"Cash Balance\" account, the Bank deposited\n\na decreasing percentage of salary to an employee's account as the\n\nemployee reached the  upper service brackets;  and the Bank  dis-\n\n                    \n\n     3Although Frankina  argues  on appeal  that his  performance\nevaluations  in 1987  and  1988 were  equivalent  to those  of  a\nyounger colleague  who was  retained, he waived  the argument  by\nfailing to raise it below.

As the evidence\n                                      \n\npresented  in the  district court  was insufficient  to enable  a\n\nfactfinder reasonably to conclude that the articulated reason for\n\nFrankina's termination was pretextual or that his termination was\n\nmotivated  by age animus, we affirm the grant of summary judgment\n\non the age discrimination claims.4 \n\nB.

As  a personnel  officer,  Ericson undoubtedly  had\n\nactual  or  apparent authority  to  hire Bank  employees.   Under\n\nMassachusetts law, however, ordinary  authority to hire is insuf-\n\nficient to  bind an employer  to a lifetime  employment contract.\n\nId.  at 18-19 (citing  cases).  Thus, holding  Ericson out as its\n   \n\nagent  for general  hiring  purposes did  not constitute  conduct\n\n                                14\n\nwarranting  an objectively  reasonable  belief  that Ericson  was\n\nauthorized to offer lifetime  employment with the Bank.

Nonetheless,  Frankina  contends that  an inference  that\n\nlifetime contracts were  commonplace at the Bank  arises from the\n\n\"widely discussed fact\" that, prior to 1989, no employee had ever\n\nbeen terminated other  than for criminal  conduct.
