David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael K.

In these interlocutory appeals in\n\ntwo   unrelated   criminal     cases,   the   government     challenges    the\n\ndistrict   court's   orders    excluding      cooperating    witnesses    from\n\ntestifying at trial.     In each case, the district court excluded a\n\nkey prosecution witness after concluding that the government had\n\nfailed to meet its disclosure obligations under Brady v. Maryland,\n\n373 U.S. 83 (1963).      Under Brady, the government has a duty to\n\ndisclose evidence in its possession that is favorable to the\n\naccused and material to guilt or punishment.                Id. at 87.      We\n\naddress the two appeals below.\n\n                          I.    Joseph Prochilo\n\n           A sting operation set up by agents of the Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\") resulted in the\n\nindictment of Joseph Prochilo for being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).              The case against\n\nProchilo relies almost solely on the expected testimony of a\n\ngovernment cooperator. The cooperator had played a central role in\n\nthe sting, both arranging and consummating the purchase of the\n\nfirearm.     Prochilo     seasonably      sought    from    the   government\n\nexculpatory and impeachment information and materials relating to\n\nthe cooperator.      The discovery request focused on evidence that\n\nProchilo might use to impeach the witness, and cited eighteen\n\ndifferent categories of evidence.         Essentially, Prochilo requested\n\nall cooperator-related evidence in the government's possession,\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fincluding: (1) all cooperation agreements between the witness and\n\ngovernment agencies; (2) copies of reports or documents relating to\n\nthe witness's \"contacts\" with those agencies; and (3) the complete\n\nfiles that any government agency had on the witness.\n\n          At a hearing on the discovery motion, the government\n\nmaintained that it had reviewed the cooperator-related files and\n\nhad turned over any Brady material in its possession.   Among other\n\nthings, the government had disclosed to Prochilo:\n\n          all payments the government [had] made to the\n          [cooperating     witness   (CW)];    the   CW's\n          cooperation     agreement   and    confidential\n          informant authorization request with the ATF;\n          the CW's criminal record; that the CW was in\n          the witness protection program and had\n          violated a rule of that program by making an\n          unauthorized trip to a prohibited area; that\n          the CW worked for, and was paid by, the DEA\n          for information, services, and security; that\n          the CW wrote a movie script that discussed his\n          use of oxycontin and criminal activities; an\n          account of the CW's illicit drug use and\n          involvement in illegal drug sales; that [the]\n          ATF had notified certain law enforcement\n          authorities of the CW's relationship with\n          [the] ATF, which had led to the dismissal of\n          state criminal charges against him; and that\n          the CW had worked as an informant for and\n          received promises, rewards, and inducements\n          from the United States Secret Service, the\n          Essex    County    [Massachusetts]    Sheriff's\n          Department, the DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency],\n          and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].1\n\n\n     1\n       Most of the evidence that the government provided to\nProchilo is not part of the record on appeal because it was\nexchanged between the parties and not filed with the district\ncourt. Various pleadings filed by the parties, however, discuss\nwhat evidence the government gave Prochilo and there is no dispute\nthat Prochilo received the materials mentioned here.\n\n                               -4-\n\fThe       district        court    initially        denied   Prochilo's     motion     for\n\nproduction as moot, with the explicit provision that he could renew\n\nhis       motion    after       reviewing       the   materials     disclosed     by   the\n\ngovernment.\n\n               Not long after the hearing, Prochilo filed a renewed\n\nmotion for production of exculpatory and impeachment information\n\nand materials.            In this motion, Prochilo asked the district court\n\nto    order        the    government       to    disclose    the    witness's     \"entire\n\nrelationship with the government.\" Prochilo requested: (1) details\n\nregarding the witness's work with the United States Secret Service,\n\nthe Essex County Sheriff's Department, the DEA, and the FBI; (2)\n\ninformation regarding the other ATF cases on which the cooperator\n\nworked; (3) the witness's cooperation agreements with government\n\nagencies other than the ATF; (4) a description of other firearms\n\nseized by the government as a result of the witness's cooperation;\n\n(5)       information         about     the   cooperator's     contacts     with     other\n\ngovernment agencies as they related to other matters or other\n\ninvestigations; and (6) a list of all benefits the witness received\n\nas    a    result        of   these     contacts.      The   district     court    granted\n\nProchilo's motion.\n\n               The government continued to resist additional disclosure,\n\nand in response Prochilo argued that the requested materials would\n\nsupport his claim that the witness had set him up, and they would\n\nenable       him     to       explore    bias    arising     from   the    cooperator's\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\frelationship to the government.              The district court reaffirmed its\n\nearlier ruling, ordering the government \"to produce all files\n\nrelated    to    the   [witness's]       relationship      with    the   Government,\n\nincluding the CW's relationship with the Government in all other\n\ncases.\"\n\n            In motions for reconsideration, the government maintained\n\nthat Prochilo had failed to provide any \"plausible indication\" that\n\nthe materials he sought contained evidence that was both favorable\n\nto   him   and    material.        The   government     did,      however,    provide\n\nadditional information about the cooperator's work with various\n\nfederal law enforcement agencies, noting that the witness had\n\nprovided assistance in twelve cases or investigations by the ATF\n\n(two of which also involved the DEA), four cases or investigations\n\nby   the   DEA    alone,     and   two   investigations      by    the   FBI.    The\n\ngovernment       explained     that    the    cooperator     had   assisted     these\n\nagencies by either providing information or playing a direct role\n\nin arranged transactions.             The government continued to maintain,\n\nhowever,    that    it   had   already       turned   over   all    Brady    material\n\nrelating to the witness.           It also asked the court to exclude the\n\nwitness from testifying at trial in the event that the court denied\n\nreconsideration.         The district court reaffirmed its order and\n\nexcluded the witness.          This appeal ensued.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f                               Discussion\n\n           \"[W]e     review   Brady      determinations       for   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.\"      United States v. DeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 65 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).       Under Brady, the government has a duty to disclose\n\nevidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused and\n\nmaterial to guilt or punishment.            373 U.S. at 87; Strickler v.\n\nGreene, 527 U.S. 263, 280 (1999).           Evidence is \"favorable to the\n\naccused\" if it is either exculpatory or impeaching in nature and\n\n\"material\" if there is a reasonable probability that, had it been\n\ndisclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n\nStrickler, 527 U.S. at 280; Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 435\n\n(1995) (evidence is material if it \"could reasonably be taken to\n\nput the whole case in such a different light as to undermine\n\nconfidence in the verdict\").\n\n           The government is primarily responsible for deciding what\n\nevidence     it   must   disclose   to      the   defendant    under   Brady.\n\nPennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 59-60 (1987).             And at least\n\nwhere a defendant has made only a general request for Brady\n\nmaterial, the government's decision about disclosure is ordinarily\n\nfinal - - unless it emerges later that exculpatory evidence was not\n\ndisclosed.    Id. at 59.\n\n           When the defendant seeks access to specific materials\n\nthat the government maintains are not discoverable under Brady,\n\nhowever, a trial court may in some instances conduct an in camera\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\freview of the disputed materials.           See Ritchie, 480 U.S. at 58\n\nn.15; United States v. Caro-Muniz, 406 F.3d 22, 29-30 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); 6 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure § 24.3(b) (3d\n\ned. 2007).    To justify such a review, the defendant must make some\n\nshowing that the materials in question could contain favorable,\n\nmaterial evidence.     Ritchie, 480 U.S. at 58 n.15 (explaining that\n\nthe defendant must establish a \"basis for his claim\" that what he\n\nseeks \"contains material evidence\"); United States v. Brandon, 17\n\nF.3d 409, 456 (1st Cir. 1994); LaFave, supra, § 24.3(b).                 This\n\nshowing cannot consist of mere speculation.                United States v.\n\nNavarro, 737 F.2d 625, 631 (7th Cir. 1984); see also Brandon, 17\n\nF.3d at 456.      Rather, the defendant should be able to articulate\n\nwith some specificity what evidence he hopes to find in the\n\nrequested materials, why he thinks the materials contain this\n\nevidence, and finally, why this evidence would be both favorable to\n\nhim and material.     United States v. Rosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d 48,\n\n55-56 (1st Cir. 1999) (illustrating the kind of showing required);\n\nCaro-Muniz, 406 F.3d at 30 (similar).\n\n             The district court's order that the government disclose\n\nall cooperator-related material in its possession directly to\n\nProchilo was not faithful to these principles.            Prochilo's motions\n\nwere general and speculative in nature.          To be sure, many of the\n\nmaterials    he   requested     could,   depending   on    the   facts   of   a\n\nparticular    case,   contain    material   impeachment     evidence.     The\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fgovernment, however, maintained that it had already disclosed all\n\nsuch evidence in Prochilo's case.       At this juncture, it was up to\n\nProchilo to put that representation into question by identifying\n\nspecific materials he wanted the court to inspect in camera and          by\n\nshowing them to be favorable and material.            He failed to do so.\n\nAccordingly, there was no basis for the court to conduct an in\n\ncamera inspection, much less order disclosure directly to Prochilo.\n\n           Prochilo's four primary arguments in support of the\n\ncourt's order are unpersuasive.         First, he speculates that the\n\nundisclosed materials might reveal that the cooperating witness is\n\n\"flawed\" or that the government's investigative techniques were\n\nflawed.   Where, as here, however, the government maintains that it\n\nhas turned over all material impeachment evidence, speculation is\n\ninsufficient to permit even an in camera review of the requested\n\nmaterials.\n\n           Second, Prochilo appears to suggest that the materials\n\nthat he desires could help substantiate an entrapment defense. For\n\nstarters, Prochilo has yet to assert an entrapment defense.             But\n\neven if he had, Brady already requires the government to disclose\n\nall favorable and material evidence in its possession to the\n\ndefendant;   this includes any evidence indicating that the witness\n\nhad   improperly   induced   Prochilo   or   others    to   commit   crimes.\n\nNothing in the record of this case suggests that the government has\n\nfailed to turn over such evidence.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f            Third, Prochilo claims that at a hearing the government\n\nstated that this is the only ATF investigation on which the witness\n\nworked    that    has    resulted    in    a     prosecution.      This   \"lack   of\n\nprosecution,\" he contends, \"begs for disclosure as it is certainly\n\nrelevant to the issue of [the witness's] credibility regarding the\n\nreasons    that    the    other     matters      were    not   prosecuted.\"       The\n\ngovernment never made such a statement, however.                  At the hearing,\n\nthe government stated only that none of the other cases had\n\nresulted in a trial.          When questioned at oral argument in this\n\ncourt, the government stated that some of the investigations did in\n\nfact result in prosecutions.\n\n            Fourth, Prochilo makes the familiar argument that he is\n\nentitled to the requested materials because only his counsel, not\n\nthe government or the district court, will be able to judge what\n\nevidence is both favorable to him and material.                 The Supreme Court\n\nhas already rejected this argument.                     Ritchie, 480 U.S. at 59\n\n(\"Defense counsel has no constitutional right to conduct his own\n\nsearch of the [government's] files to argue relevance.\").                     Brady\n\ndid not create a broad rule of discovery in criminal cases.                       See\n\nid. at 59-60.\n\n            In sum, the district court's approach shifted from the\n\ngovernment to the defendant the primary authority to assess whether\n\nmaterial in the government's possession must be disclosed, and in\n\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fso doing endorsed a broad rule of discovery in criminal cases;\n\nBrady permits neither.    See Navarro, 737 F.2d at 631.\n\n                          II. Elvis Guerrero\n\n           In this case a sting operation set up by federal agents\n\nresulted in the arrests and indictments of Elvis Guerrero and two\n\nothers for attempting to purchase cocaine.       The government charged\n\nall three with conspiring to distribute cocaine and with attempting\n\nto possess cocaine with the intent to distribute.      See 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n846, 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 2.\n\n           The government's case against Guerrero hinges almost\n\nexclusively on the testimony of a long-time government cooperator\n\nwho had played an integral role in the sting.           The government\n\ndisclosed to Guerrero impeachment evidence that it considered\n\ndiscoverable under Brady.      This evidence included information that\n\nthe witness had been paid $5,000 for her work on the case, a\n\nredacted   report   of   her   criminal   and   probation   record,   and\n\ninformation indicating that she had worked for the government for\n\nmany years.\n\n           Not satisfied with the extent of the disclosure, Guerrero\n\nfiled a motion to compel further discovery, requesting that the\n\ncourt order the government \"to produce all information in its\n\npossession, custody, or control, regarding the [witness],\" and\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fidentifying several categories of information.2         The motion also\n\nexplained generally how each category of evidence could contain\n\nuseful impeachment evidence.\n\n          The motion to compel was addressed at a final pretrial\n\nconference, during which the government maintained that it had\n\nreviewed the witness's voluminous file and had turned over all\n\nBrady material in its possession. Despite this representation, the\n\ndistrict court granted the defendant's motion in its entirety,\n\ntelling the government to \"give him everything.\" The court further\n\nruled that, to the extent that the government had doubts about\n\nparticular materials, it could ask the court to review those\n\nmaterials in camera.\n\n          The   government   filed   a   motion   for   reconsideration,\n\nstating that it had supplemented its disclosure, turning over \"the\n\nCW's [(cooperating witness's)] criminal history; a detailed listing\n\n\n     2\n       The motion to compel encompassed the following categories:\n(1) information about the government's prior use of the cooperator,\nincluding the case name and number of each prosecution in which she\nhad been used by any federal, state, or local law enforcement\nagency as a witness, a cooperating individual, or source of\ninformation; (2) all agreements between the witness and any\nfederal, state, or local law enforcement entity, all documents\nreflecting payments made to her or on her behalf, and any\ninformation regarding promises, rewards or inducements (including\npreferential treatment) to the witness, her family, or her friends\nand associates; (3) the witness's arrest and conviction record and\nall information concerning any unauthorized criminal activity or\nmisconduct by her, as well as any prison records; (4) information\nregarding any assets the cooperator had obtained from criminal\nactivity over the last 15 years; and (5) information reflecting her\nbad character or matters relevant to her credibility, including\nevidence of impairments, poor memory, and bias.\n\n                                -12-\n\fof payments the CW received in this case as well as in other\n\ninvestigations and/or cases over the past 17 years, reflecting both\n\nthe years of payment and number of cases; information about the\n\nCW's immigration status; and four cooperation agreements between\n\nthe Drug Enforcement Administration ('DEA') and the CW, including\n\nthe   cooperation    agreement     in    force   during      this    case   and   one\n\ncurrently in force as the CW continues to work with the DEA.\"                     The\n\ngovernment maintained that no other material in its possession was\n\ndiscoverable under Brady.         As in Prochilo's case, the prosecutors\n\nasked the court, if it were to deny reconsideration, to also\n\nexclude the witness from testifying so that an immediate appeal\n\nwould   lie.        The     district     court      denied     the    motion      for\n\nreconsideration and excluded the witness.\n\n                                  Discussion\n\n           Applying       the   same    standards    as   we   have    applied     in\n\nreviewing the government's appeal in Prochilo's case, we cannot\n\ndiscern a basis for concluding that Guerrero met his burden of\n\narticulating with some specificity what evidence he hopes to find\n\nin the requested materials, why he thinks the materials contain\n\nthis evidence, and why this evidence would be both favorable to him\n\nand also material.        Rosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d 48, 55-56.\n\n           The motion to compel discovery broadly requested access\n\nto all cooperator-related materials in the government's possession\n\nand merely speculated that these materials could contain material\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fimpeachment evidence.      Such a showing is insufficient to permit\n\neven an in camera review of the disputed materials.       Nevertheless,\n\nthe district court once again ordered the government to disclose\n\nall   cooperator-related    materials   directly   to   the   defendant.\n\nConsequently, the court erred both in its disclosure ruling and to\n\nthe extent that it agreed to conduct an in camera review of certain\n\ncooperator-related materials.\n\n           We do not, however, completely rule out in camera review\n\nhere.   On remand, Guerrero should be allowed to request access to\n\nspecific materials and to make a case for in camera inspection of\n\nthose materials. In his appellate brief, Guerrero does endeavor to\n\nmake the necessary particularized showing.         In support of his\n\nrequest for the files of unrelated cases on which the cooperator\n\nworked, Guerrero says that he has evidence showing that she was\n\npaid widely varying amounts for her work (e.g., $18,700 in one case\n\nand $100 in another).      He argues that the case files may reveal\n\nthat the witness worked on a commission basis, that is, payments to\n\nher were dependent on how many defendants she implicated.        Access\n\nto the case files, Guerrero claims, will allow him to determine\n\nwhether or not this commission theory is accurate and, if it is,\n\nwill provide him with further grounds for impeachment.           Whether\n\nsuch a showing is sufficient to justify an in camera review of\n\ncertain files is committed to the discretion of the district court\n\nin the first instance.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          A   couple   of   loose   ends   remain.   First,   Guerrero's\n\nsuggestion that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment\n\nprovides an independent ground for upholding the district court's\n\norder is incorrect.    The Supreme Court has thus far only evaluated\n\ndisclosure claims like Guerrero's under the Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.       United States v. Bagley, 473\n\nU.S. 674-78 (1985); see also Ritchie, 480 U.S. at 51-54.        Second,\n\nhis argument about the government's handling of a videotape of the\n\nalleged drug transaction is not properly before us.\n\n                            III.    Conclusion\n\n          We reverse the exclusion order in No. 09-1450 (Prochilo),\n\nvacate the exclusion order in No. 09-1523 (Guerrero), and remand\n\nboth cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f",

Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Under <i>Brady,</i> the government has a duty to disclose evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment. <i>Id.</i> at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. We address the two appeals below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Joseph Prochilo</h2>\n<p>A sting operation set up by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\") resulted in the indictment of Joseph Prochilo for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). The case against Prochilo relies almost solely on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> the expected testimony of a government cooperator. The cooperator had played a central role in the sting, both arranging and consummating the purchase of the firearm. Prochilo seasonably sought from the government exculpatory and impeachment information and materials relating to the cooperator. The discovery request focused on evidence that Prochilo might use to impeach the witness, and cited eighteen different categories of evidence. Essentially, Prochilo requested all cooperator-related evidence in the government's possession, including: (1) all cooperation agreements between the witness and government agencies; (2) copies of reports or documents relating to the witness's \"contacts\" with those agencies; and (3) the complete files that any government agency had on the witness.</p>\n<p>At a hearing on the discovery motion, the government maintained that it had reviewed the cooperator-related files and had turned over any <i>Brady</i> material in its possession. Among other things, the government had disclosed to Prochilo:</p>\n<blockquote>all payments the government [had] made to the [cooperating witness (CW)]; the CW's cooperation agreement and confidential informant authorization request with the ATF; the CW's criminal record; that the CW was in the witness protection program and had violated a rule of that program by making an unauthorized trip to a prohibited area; that the CW worked for, and was paid by, the DEA for information, services, and security; that the CW wrote a movie script that discussed his use of oxycontin and criminal activities; an account of the CW's illicit drug use and involvement in illegal drug sales; that [the] ATF had notified certain law enforcement authorities of the CW's relationship with [the] ATF, which had led to the dismissal of state criminal charges against him; and that the CW had worked as an informant for and received promises, rewards, and inducements from the United States Secret Service, the Essex County [Massachusetts] Sheriff's Department, the DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency], and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The district court initially denied Prochilo's motion for production as moot, with the explicit provision that he could renew his motion after reviewing the materials disclosed by the government.</p>\n<p>Not long after the hearing, Prochilo filed a renewed motion for production of exculpatory and impeachment information and materials. In this motion, Prochilo asked the district court to order the government to disclose the witness's \"entire relationship with the government.\" Prochilo requested: (1) details regarding the witness's work with the United States Secret Service, the Essex County Sheriff's Department, the DEA, and the FBI; (2) information regarding the other ATF cases on which the cooperator worked; (3) the witness's cooperation agreements with government agencies other than the ATF; (4) a description of other firearms seized by the government as a result of the witness's cooperation; (5) information about the cooperator's contacts with other government agencies as they related to other matters or other investigations; and (6) a list of all benefits the witness received as a result of these contacts. The district court granted Prochilo's motion.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> The government continued to resist additional disclosure, and in response Prochilo argued that the requested materials would support his claim that the witness had set him up, and they would enable him to explore bias arising from the cooperator's relationship to the government. The district court reaffirmed its earlier ruling, ordering the government \"to produce all files related to the [witness's] relationship with the Government, including the CW's relationship with the Government in all other cases.\"</p>\n<p>In motions for reconsideration, the government maintained that Prochilo had failed to provide any \"plausible indication\" that the materials he sought contained evidence that was both favorable to him and material. The government did, however, provide additional information about the cooperator's work with various federal law enforcement agencies, noting that the witness had provided assistance in twelve cases or investigations by the ATF (two of which also involved the DEA), four cases or investigations by the DEA alone, and two investigations by the FBI. The government explained that the cooperator had assisted these agencies by either providing information or playing a direct role in arranged transactions. The government continued to maintain, however, that it had already turned over all <i>Brady</i> material relating to the witness. It also asked the court to exclude the witness from testifying at trial in the event that the court denied reconsideration. The district court reaffirmed its order and excluded the witness. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>\"[W]e review <i>Brady</i> determinations for abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 65 (1st Cir.2008). Under <i>Brady,</i> the government has a duty to disclose evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment. 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194; <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). Evidence is \"favorable to the accused\" if it is either exculpatory or impeaching in nature and \"material\" if there is a reasonable probability that, had it been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <i>Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936; <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (evidence is material if it \"could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict\").</p>\n<p>The government is primarily responsible for deciding what evidence it must disclose to the defendant under <i>Brady. Pennsylvania v. Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. 39, 59-60, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987). And at least where a defendant has made only a general request for <i>Brady</i> material, the government's decision about disclosure is ordinarily final  unless it emerges later that exculpatory evidence was not disclosed. <i>Id.</i> at 59, 107 S.Ct. 989.</p>\n<p>When the defendant seeks access to specific materials that the government maintains are not discoverable under <i>Brady,</i> however, a trial court may in some instances conduct an <i>in camera</i> review of the disputed materials. <i>See </i><i>Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. at 58 n. 15, 107 S.Ct. 989; <i>United States v. Caro-Muniz,</i> 406 F.3d 22, 29-30 (1st Cir.2005); 6 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure § 24.3(b) (3d ed. 2007). To justify such a review, the defendant must make some showing that the materials in question could contain favorable, material evidence. <i>Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. at 58 n. 15, 107 S.Ct. 989 (explaining that the defendant must establish a \"basis for his claim\" that what he seeks \"contains material evidence\"); <i>United States v. Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 456 (1st Cir.1994); <i>LaFave, supra,</i> § 24.3(b). This showing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*269</span> cannot consist of mere speculation. <i>United States v. Navarro,</i> 737 F.2d 625, 631 (7th Cir.1984); <i>see also </i><i>Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d at 456. Rather, the defendant should be able to articulate with some specificity what evidence he hopes to find in the requested materials, why he thinks the materials contain this evidence, and finally, why this evidence would be both favorable to him and material. <i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d 48, 55-56 (1st Cir.1999) (illustrating the kind of showing required); <i>Caro-Muniz,</i> 406 F.3d at 30 (similar).</p>\n<p>The district court's order that the government disclose all cooperator-related material in its possession directly to Prochilo was not faithful to these principles. Prochilo's motions were general and speculative in nature. To be sure, many of the materials he requested could, depending on the facts of a particular case, contain material impeachment evidence. The government, however, maintained that it had already disclosed all such evidence in Prochilo's case. At this juncture, it was up to Prochilo to put that representation into question by identifying specific materials he wanted the court to inspect <i>in camera</i> and by showing them to be favorable and material. He failed to do so. Accordingly, there was no basis for the court to conduct an <i>in camera</i> inspection, much less order disclosure directly to Prochilo.</p>\n<p>Prochilo's four primary arguments in support of the court's order are unpersuasive. First, he speculates that the undisclosed materials might reveal that the cooperating witness is \"flawed\" or that the government's investigative techniques were flawed. Where, as here, however, the government maintains that it has turned over all material impeachment evidence, speculation is insufficient to permit even an <i>in camera</i> review of the requested materials.</p>\n<p>Second, Prochilo appears to suggest that the materials that he desires could help substantiate an entrapment defense. For starters, Prochilo has yet to assert an entrapment defense. But even if he had, <i>Brady</i> already requires the government to disclose all favorable and material evidence in its possession to the defendant; this includes any evidence indicating that the witness had improperly induced Prochilo or others to commit crimes. Nothing in the record of this case suggests that the government has failed to turn over such evidence.</p>\n<p>Third, Prochilo claims that at a hearing the government stated that this is the only ATF investigation on which the witness worked that has resulted in a prosecution. This \"lack of prosecution,\" he contends, \"begs for disclosure as it is certainly relevant to the issue of [the witness's] credibility regarding the reasons that the other matters were not prosecuted.\" The government never made such a statement, however. At the hearing, the government stated only that none of the other cases had resulted in a trial. When questioned at oral argument in this court, the government stated that some of the investigations did in fact result in prosecutions.</p>\n<p>Fourth, Prochilo makes the familiar argument that he is entitled to the requested materials because only his counsel, not the government or the district court, will be able to judge what evidence is both favorable to him and material. The Supreme Court has already rejected this argument. <i>Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. at 59, 107 S.Ct. 989 (\"Defense counsel has no constitutional right to conduct his own search of the [government's] files to argue relevance.\"). <i>Brady</i> did not create a broad rule of discovery in criminal cases. <i>See id.</i> at 59-60, 107 S.Ct. 989.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*270</span> In sum, the district court's approach shifted from the government to the defendant the primary authority to assess whether material in the government's possession must be disclosed, and in so doing endorsed a broad rule of discovery in criminal cases; <i>Brady</i> permits neither. <i>See </i><i>Navarro,</i> 737 F.2d at 631.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Elvis Guerrero</h2>\n<p>In this case a sting operation set up by federal agents resulted in the arrests and indictments of Elvis Guerrero and two others for attempting to purchase cocaine. The government charged all three with conspiring to distribute cocaine and with attempting to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 2.</p>\n<p>The government's case against Guerrero hinges almost exclusively on the testimony of a long-time government cooperator who had played an integral role in the sting. The government disclosed to Guerrero impeachment evidence that it considered discoverable under <i>Brady.</i> This evidence included information that the witness had been paid $5,000 for her work on the case, a redacted report of her criminal and probation record, and information indicating that she had worked for the government for many years.</p>\n<p>Not satisfied with the extent of the disclosure, Guerrero filed a motion to compel further discovery, requesting that the court order the government \"to produce all information in its possession, custody, or control, regarding the [witness],\" and identifying several categories of information.<sup>[2]</sup> The motion also explained generally how each category of evidence could contain useful impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p>The motion to compel was addressed at a final pretrial conference, during which the government maintained that it had reviewed the witness's voluminous file and had turned over all <i>Brady</i> material in its possession. Despite this representation, the district court granted the defendant's motion in its entirety, telling the government to \"give him everything.\" The court further ruled that, to the extent that the government had doubts about particular materials, it could ask the court to review those materials <i>in camera.</i></p>\n<p>The government filed a motion for reconsideration, stating that it had supplemented its disclosure, turning over \"the CW's [(cooperating witness's)] criminal history; a detailed listing of payments the CW received in this case as well as in other investigations and/or cases over the past 17 years, reflecting both the years of payment and number of cases; information about the CW's immigration status; and four cooperation agreements between the Drug Enforcement Administration ('DEA') and the CW, including the cooperation agreement in force during this case and one currently in force as the CW <span class=\"star-pagination\">*271</span> continues to work with the DEA.\" The government maintained that no other material in its possession was discoverable under <i>Brady.</i> As in Prochilo's case, the prosecutors asked the court, if it were to deny reconsideration, to also exclude the witness from testifying so that an immediate appeal would lie. The district court denied the motion for reconsideration and excluded the witness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>Applying the same standards as we have applied in reviewing the government's appeal in Prochilo's case, we cannot discern a basis for concluding that Guerrero met his burden of articulating with some specificity what evidence he hopes to find in the requested materials, why he thinks the materials contain this evidence, and why this evidence would be both favorable to him and also material. <i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d 48, 55-56.</p>\n<p>The motion to compel discovery broadly requested access to all cooperator-related materials in the government's possession and merely speculated that these materials could contain material impeachment evidence. Such a showing is insufficient to permit even an <i>in camera</i> review of the disputed materials. Nevertheless, the district court once again ordered the government to disclose all cooperator-related materials directly to the defendant. Consequently, the court erred both in its disclosure ruling and to the extent that it agreed to conduct an <i>in camera</i> review of certain cooperator-related materials.</p>\n<p>We do not, however, completely rule out <i>in camera</i> review here. On remand, Guerrero should be allowed to request access to specific materials and to make a case for <i>in camera</i> inspection of those materials. In his appellate brief, Guerrero does endeavor to make the necessary particularized showing. In support of his request for the files of unrelated cases on which the cooperator worked, Guerrero says that he has evidence showing that she was paid widely varying amounts for her work (e.g., $18,700 in one case and $100 in another). He argues that the case files may reveal that the witness worked on a commission basis, that is, payments to her were dependent on how many defendants she implicated. Access to the case files, Guerrero claims, will allow him to determine whether or not this commission theory is accurate and, if it is, will provide him with further grounds for impeachment. Whether such a showing is sufficient to justify an <i>in camera</i> review of certain files is committed to the discretion of the district court in the first instance.</p>\n<p>A couple of loose ends remain. First, Guerrero's suggestion that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment provides an independent ground for upholding the district court's order is incorrect. The Supreme Court has thus far only evaluated disclosure claims like Guerrero's under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. <i>United States v. Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. 667, 674-78, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); <i>see also </i><i>Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. at 51-54, 107 S.Ct. 989. Second, his argument about the government's handling of a videotape of the alleged drug transaction is not properly before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We <i>reverse</i> the exclusion order in No. 09-1450 (Prochilo), <i>vacate</i> the exclusion order in No. 09-1523 (Guerrero), and <i>remand</i> both cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Most of the evidence that the government provided to Prochilo is not part of the record on appeal because it was exchanged between the parties and not filed with the district court. Various pleadings filed by the parties, however, discuss what evidence the government gave Prochilo and there is no dispute that Prochilo received the materials mentioned here.</p>\n<p>[2]  The motion to compel encompassed the following categories: (1) information about the government's prior use of the cooperator, including the case name and number of each prosecution in which she had been used by any federal, state, or local law enforcement agency as a witness, a cooperating individual, or source of information; (2) all agreements between the witness and any federal, state, or local law enforcement entity, all documents reflecting payments made to her or on her behalf, and any information regarding promises, rewards or inducements (including preferential treatment) to the witness, her family, or her friends and associates; (3) the witness's arrest and conviction record and all information concerning any unauthorized criminal activity or misconduct by her, as well as any prison records; (4) information regarding any assets the cooperator had obtained from criminal activity over the last 15 years; and (5) information reflecting her bad character or matters relevant to her credibility, including evidence of impairments, poor memory, and bias.</p>\n\n</div>",

Prochilo's motions were general and speculative in nature. To be sure, many of the materials he requested could, depending on the facts of a particular case, contain material impeachment evidence. The government, however, maintained that it had already disclosed all such evidence in Prochilo's case. At this juncture, it was up to Prochilo to put that representation into question by identifying specific materials he wanted the court to inspect <i>in camera</i> and by showing them to be favorable and material. He failed to do so. Accordingly, there was no basis for the court to conduct an <i>in camera</i> inspection, much less order disclosure directly to Prochilo.</p>\n<p>Prochilo's four primary arguments in support of the court's order are unpersuasive. First, he speculates that the undisclosed materials might reveal that the cooperating witness is \"flawed\" or that the government's investigative techniques were flawed. Where, as here, however, the government maintains that it has turned over all material impeachment evidence, speculation is insufficient to permit even an <i>in camera</i> review of the requested materials.</p>\n<p>Second, Prochilo appears to suggest that the materials that he desires could help substantiate an entrapment defense. For starters, Prochilo has yet to assert an entrapment defense. But even if he had, <i>Brady</i> already requires the government to disclose all favorable and material evidence in its possession to the defendant; this includes any evidence indicating that the witness had improperly induced Prochilo or others to commit crimes. Nothing in the record of this case suggests that the government has failed to turn over such evidence.</p>\n<p>Third, Prochilo claims that at a hearing the government stated that this is the only ATF investigation on which the witness worked that has resulted in a prosecution. This \"lack of prosecution,\" he contends, \"begs for disclosure as it is certainly relevant to the issue of [the witness's] credibility regarding the reasons that the other matters were not prosecuted.\" The government never made such a statement, however. At the hearing, the government stated only that none of the other cases had resulted in a trial. When questioned at oral argument in this court, the government stated that some of the investigations did in fact result in prosecutions.</p>\n<p>Fourth, Prochilo makes the familiar argument that he is entitled to the requested materials because only his counsel, not the government or the district court, will be able to judge what evidence is both favorable to him and material. The Supreme Court has already rejected this argument. <i>Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. at 59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111822\"><a href=\"/opinion/111822/pennsylvania-v-ritchie/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span> (\"Defense counsel has no constitutional right to conduct his own search of the [government's] files to argue relevance.\"). <i>Brady</i> did not create a broad rule of discovery in criminal cases. <i>See id.</i> at 59-60, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111822\"><a href=\"/opinion/111822/pennsylvania-v-ritchie/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*270</span> In sum, the district court's approach shifted from the government to the defendant the primary authority to assess whether material in the government's possession must be disclosed, and in so doing endorsed a broad rule of discovery in criminal cases; <i>Brady</i> permits neither. <i>See </i><i>Navarro,</i> 737 F.2d at 631.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Elvis Guerrero</h2>\n<p>In this case a sting operation set up by federal agents resulted in the arrests and indictments of Elvis Guerrero and two others for attempting to purchase cocaine. The government charged all three with conspiring to distribute cocaine and with attempting to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 2.</p>\n<p>The government's case against Guerrero hinges almost exclusively on the testimony of a long-time government cooperator who had played an integral role in the sting. The government disclosed to Guerrero impeachment evidence that it considered discoverable under <i>Brady.</i> This evidence included information that the witness had been paid $5,000 for her work on the case, a redacted report of her criminal and probation record, and information indicating that she had worked for the government for many years.</p>\n<p>Not satisfied with the extent of the disclosure, Guerrero filed a motion to compel further discovery, requesting that the court order the government \"to produce all information in its possession, custody, or control, regarding the [witness],\" and identifying several categories of information.<sup>[2]</sup> The motion also explained generally how each category of evidence could contain useful impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p>The motion to compel was addressed at a final pretrial conference, during which the government maintained that it had reviewed the witness's voluminous file and had turned over all <i>Brady</i> material in its possession. Despite this representation, the district court granted the defendant's motion in its entirety, telling the government to \"give him everything.\" The court further ruled that, to the extent that the government had doubts about particular materials, it could ask the court to review those materials <i>in camera.</i></p>\n<p>The government filed a motion for reconsideration, stating that it had supplemented its disclosure, turning over \"the CW's [(cooperating witness's)] criminal history; a detailed listing of payments the CW received in this case as well as in other investigations and/or cases over the past 17 years, reflecting both the years of payment and number of cases; information about the CW's immigration status; and four cooperation agreements between the Drug Enforcement Administration ('DEA') and the CW, including the cooperation agreement in force during this case and one currently in force as the CW <span class=\"star-pagination\">*271</span> continues to work with the DEA.\" The government maintained that no other material in its possession was discoverable under <i>Brady.</i> As in Prochilo's case, the prosecutors asked the court, if it were to deny reconsideration, to also exclude the witness from testifying so that an immediate appeal would lie. The district court denied the motion for reconsideration and excluded the witness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>Applying the same standards as we have applied in reviewing the government's appeal in Prochilo's case, we cannot discern a basis for concluding that Guerrero met his burden of articulating with some specificity what evidence he hopes to find in the requested materials, why he thinks the materials contain this evidence, and why this evidence would be both favorable to him and also material. <i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763556\"><a href=\"/opinion/763556/united-states-v-cruz-rosario-peralta-aka-crescencio-cedeno-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 55-56.</p>\n<p>The motion to compel discovery broadly requested access to all cooperator-related materials in the government's possession and merely speculated that these materials could contain material impeachment evidence. Such a showing is insufficient to permit even an <i>in camera</i> review of the disputed materials. Nevertheless, the district court once again ordered the government to disclose all cooperator-related materials directly to the defendant. Consequently, the court erred both in its disclosure ruling and to the extent that it agreed to conduct an <i>in camera</i> review of certain cooperator-related materials.</p>\n<p>We do not, however, completely rule out <i>in camera</i> review here. On remand, Guerrero should be allowed to request access to specific materials and to make a case for <i>in camera</i> inspection of those materials. In his appellate brief, Guerrero does endeavor to make the necessary particularized showing. In support of his request for the files of unrelated cases on which the cooperator worked, Guerrero says that he has evidence showing that she was paid widely varying amounts for her work (e.g., $18,700 in one case and $100 in another). He argues that the case files may reveal that the witness worked on a commission basis, that is, payments to her were dependent on how many defendants she implicated. Access to the case files, Guerrero claims, will allow him to determine whether or not this commission theory is accurate and, if it is, will provide him with further grounds for impeachment. Whether such a showing is sufficient to justify an <i>in camera</i> review of certain files is committed to the discretion of the district court in the first instance.</p>\n<p>A couple of loose ends remain. First, Guerrero's suggestion that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment provides an independent ground for upholding the district court's order is incorrect. The Supreme Court has thus far only evaluated disclosure claims like Guerrero's under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. <i>United States v. Bagley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 674-78, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We <i>reverse</i> the exclusion order in No. 09-1450 (Prochilo), <i>vacate</i> the exclusion order in No. 09-1523 (Guerrero), and <i>remand</i> both cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Most of the evidence that the government provided to Prochilo is not part of the record on appeal because it was exchanged between the parties and not filed with the district court. Various pleadings filed by the parties, however, discuss what evidence the government gave Prochilo and there is no dispute that Prochilo received the materials mentioned here.</p>\n<p>[2]  The motion to compel encompassed the following categories: (1) information about the government's prior use of the cooperator, including the case name and number of each prosecution in which she had been used by any federal, state, or local law enforcement agency as a witness, a cooperating individual, or source of information; (2) all agreements between the witness and any federal, state, or local law enforcement entity, all documents reflecting payments made to her or on her behalf, and any information regarding promises, rewards or inducements (including preferential treatment) to the witness, her family, or her friends and associates; (3) the witness's arrest and conviction record and all information concerning any unauthorized criminal activity or misconduct by her, as well as any prison records; (4) information regarding any assets the cooperator had obtained from criminal activity over the last 15 years; and (5) information reflecting her bad character or matters relevant to her credibility, including evidence of impairments, poor memory, and bias.</p>\n\n</div>",
