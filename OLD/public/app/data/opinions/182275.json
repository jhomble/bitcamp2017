Rya Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Howard and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jonathan Shapiro, with whom Alexandra Deal was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Scott A. C. Meisler, Criminal Division, Appellate Section,\nUnited States Department of Justice, with whom Carmen M. Ortiz,\nUnited States Attorney, Thomas E. Kanwit, Assistant United States\nAttorney, Lanny A. Breuer, Assistant Attorney General, and Greg D.\nAndres, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General, were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n                         January 5, 2011\n\f          THOMPSON,     Circuit   Judge.    Following     a    comprehensive\n\ninvestigation    into   the   organized    drug   trade   in    a   blighted\n\nneighborhood of Boston, a jury convicted Darren Franklin of several\n\ncharges stemming from the sale of crack cocaine and the possession\n\nof both drugs and ammunition.            On appeal, Franklin seeks to\n\noverturn those convictions, alleging an illegal search and an\n\noverly long time to trial.     After careful consideration, we agree\n\nwith the district court's disposition of both issues.            We affirm.\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\nDrugs and Ammunition\n\n          In 2003, federal, state, and local authorities began\n\nconducting a coordinated investigation of the drug trade around the\n\nWarren Gardens housing complex in the Roxbury section of Boston.1\n\nFranklin's reputation as a mid-level supplier of crack cocaine to\n\nstreet dealers led law enforcement to peg him as a primary target.\n\nLooking to nab the cautious Franklin on concrete charges, law\n\nenforcement set up two controlled buys of crack cocaine.\n\n          The first controlled buy occurred on July 10, 2003.            On\n\nCopeland Street in Roxbury, an undercover Boston police officer\n\napproached a street dealer from whom he had previously purchased\n\ncrack cocaine.    Queried about the availability of crack cocaine,\n\n\n     1\n       Authorities involved in the investigation included the\nBoston Housing Police, the Boston Police (specifically the Youth\nViolence Task Force, or gang unit), the Massachusetts State Police,\nthe United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and\nExplosives, and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthe dealer shook hands with the officer, told him to sit on a\n\nnearby set of stairs, and then walked over to a dark-colored\n\nminivan.   The dealer spoke with two individuals in the van, one of\n\nwhom was later identified as Franklin.              Apparently fearful of\n\nsurveillance    —    rightly   so,   given   that   the   Copeland   Street\n\ninteractions were being recorded on video — Franklin told the\n\ndealer to move to a more discreet location before consummating the\n\ndeal.   The officer and the dealer crossed Warren Street and ended\n\nup on Rockland Street in the Warren Gardens complex, where (a\n\ndetective would later testify) it is nearly impossible to conduct\n\nsurveillance.       The van arrived at Rockland Street moments later.\n\nThe dealer approached the van, and Franklin passed a plastic bag to\n\nthe van's other occupant, who then handed the bag to the dealer\n\nthrough the van's open window.          The dealer removed a rock-like\n\nmaterial from the bag, cut off a chunk, and handed it to the\n\nofficer.   In return, the officer gave $150 to the dealer, who then\n\ngot into the van's back seat.        As the van pulled away, the officer\n\nsaw the dealer pass the money to Franklin.          The chunk of rock-like\n\nmaterial was later determined to contain a net weight of 1.3 grams\n\nof crack cocaine.\n\n           The second controlled buy took place on March 12, 2004.\n\nThis time, law enforcement employed a confidential informant (\"CI\")\n\nto arrange a more substantial purchase from Franklin — the goal was\n\nan ounce, or roughly 28 grams of crack cocaine.           With an officer\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fpresent, the CI twice tried to reach Franklin by phone before he\n\ncalled her back.   The CI and Franklin arranged a deal to take place\n\nat   the   Presidential   Acres    apartment   complex   in   Randolph,\n\nMassachusetts, where Franklin's mother lived. Specifically, the CI\n\nasked for \"a full one\" — referring to an ounce — which Franklin\n\nsaid he'd sell her for \"a G\" — referring to $1000.            Officers\n\nsearched the CI and her vehicle and found no drugs or money; they\n\nthen provided her with $1000 in government money and placed a radio\n\ntransmitter in her vehicle, on the driver's side visor.\n\n           The CI traveled to the appointed location in Randolph and\n\nparked by the pool.   Officers were posted at various places around\n\nthe apartment complex, monitoring audio from the CI's vehicle and\n\nrecording video of Franklin.      The officers' surveillance revealed\n\nthat Franklin exited his mother's apartment, got into a brown\n\nvehicle, and drove to meet the CI by the pool.     Franklin got out of\n\nhis vehicle and into the CI's.       The two of them conversed for a\n\ncouple of minutes, and then Franklin got back into his vehicle and\n\nleft.   The CI also drove away, followed by a DEA agent.       About a\n\nmile away from the apartment complex, the CI and the agent pulled\n\nover, and the CI handed over to the agent bags containing a rock-\n\nlike substance.    The rock-like substance was later determined to\n\ncontain a net weight of 26.5 grams of crack cocaine.\n\n           On April 14, 2004, the government was ready to move in on\n\nFranklin: a grand jury returned an indictment charging him with\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthree counts of cocaine possession with intent to distribute, and\n\nthe court issued a warrant for his arrest.             That very night,\n\nDetective Robert Fratalia set up a post at 159 Pine Grove Drive in\n\nBrockton, Massachusetts, where Franklin was living with then-\n\ngirlfriend   Fania   Hemingway   and    her   two   children.   Fratalia\n\nsurveilled both the apartment complex's courtyard and a blue Ford\n\nTaurus sedan that was registered to Franklin's mother and that he\n\nhad previously seen Franklin drive.           Detective (and deputized\n\nfederal agent) George MacLaughlin and Agent Michael Cashman were\n\nalso posted separately nearby.\n\n          At around 11:30 p.m., an individual fitting Franklin's\n\ndescription — a black man, around 30 years old, six feet tall or\n\nso, and probably 270 or 280 pounds — emerged from the courtyard and\n\ngot into the front seat of a white sedan, which then drove away.\n\nThe car returned about half an hour later, and the individual\n\nheaded into the courtyard and out of Fratalia's sight.          About an\n\nhour after that, the same individual emerged again, this time\n\ncarrying a shopping bag, which he placed in the trunk of the blue\n\nFord Taurus sedan.    He got into the Taurus's driver seat, started\n\nthe car, and began to pull away but stopped almost immediately;\n\nthen he waited a couple of minutes, got out of the car, locked it,\n\nand returned to the courtyard.\n\n          By around 5:30 a.m. on April 15, 2004, a SWAT team had\n\narrived to arrest Franklin, who (law enforcement had reasonably\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fconcluded) was the individual Fratalia had observed.        The team\n\nsurrounded the apartment complex.      Officer Brian Cahoon, a member\n\nof the SWAT team, used a cell phone to call into Franklin's\n\napartment.    Hemingway answered the phone and then passed it to\n\nFranklin.    Cahoon told Franklin that the apartment was surrounded,\n\nso Franklin prepared to surrender: he got dressed, gathered his\n\nphone, his keys, and some loose cash, and then came out carrying a\n\nplastic bag full of ammunition.        He was directed to leave his\n\nbelongings on the ground and to crawl on all fours toward nearby\n\nofficers; he was then placed in plastic cuffs and taken into\n\ncustody.\n\n            Franklin was brought to MacLaughlin and Cashman, who\n\nintroduced themselves and advised him of his Miranda rights.\n\nFranklin said he understood.      By all accounts, the agents told\n\nFranklin that he had been observed placing a plastic bag in the\n\ntrunk of the blue Ford Taurus.   Here, however, the record diverges\n\na bit.\n\n            According to Cashman, the agents asked Franklin if he\n\nwould consent to a search of the car.     Franklin skirted the issue\n\nby responding that the car was his mother's.      Cashman then asked\n\nhim what was in the plastic bag; Franklin said it was a little\n\nweed.    Cashman followed up by asking why he had placed a little\n\nweed in the car; Franklin said he had heard that his people were\n\ngetting arrested, and he wanted to protect his girlfriend by\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fremoving any contraband from the apartment.       Having secured this\n\ninformation, Cashman repeated his initial request that Franklin\n\nconsent to a search of the car.    Franklin replied, \"Yeah, do what\n\nyou got to do.\" Cashman testified specifically that the agents did\n\nnot tell Franklin that they would get a warrant to search the car\n\nif he did not consent.\n\n            According to MacLaughlin, the conversation went more or\n\nless as Cashman testified.   Under MacLaughlin's version of events,\n\nhowever, Franklin only explained why he had placed the marijuana in\n\nthe trunk of the Taurus — to protect his girlfriend — after telling\n\nthe agents to \"do what you got to do.\"\n\n            According to Franklin, however, the agents first asked\n\nhim what he had been doing in the car at night.    Franklin told them\n\nthat he \"was just going out to my car to smoke some weed.\"       They\n\nasked what was in the bag that he had placed in the trunk.         He\n\nreplied, \"some sneakers.\" Then the agents asked whether they could\n\nsearch the car, to which Franklin replied, \"no.\"     After conferring\n\nwith one another, the agents asked Franklin whether the car was his\n\nmother's.    He replied that the car was his but was registered to\n\nhis mother. Stymied, McLaughlin said, \"Well, you know we could tow\n\nthe car until we get a search warrant.\"     Only at this point did\n\nFranklin offer the response that the officers took as consent:\n\n\"Well, do what you got to do then.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f           On the basis of Franklin's apparent consent, McLaughlin\n\nretrieved the keys to the Taurus from Hemingway.            The agents\n\nsearched the car, finding a bag in the trunk.       The bag contained a\n\nshoe box, the shoe box contained a smaller bag, and that bag\n\ncontained 66 grams of crack cocaine and 91 grams of marijuana.\n\nPretrial Procedural Hiccups\n\n           On April 20, 2004, Franklin entered a plea of not guilty,\n\nand on October 14, 2004, he moved to suppress the fruits of the\n\nagents' search of the car, arguing that he had not actually\n\nconsented to the search.      Franklin also requested an evidentiary\n\nhearing on the issue. The government opposed the motion and argued\n\nthat there was no need for a hearing.\n\n           In the meantime, on October 28, 2004, Franklin was also\n\nindicted on another possession-with-intent-to-distribute charge,\n\nthis time stemming from the drugs the agents found in the car; the\n\nnew   indictment   also   added   a   felon-in-possession-of-ammunition\n\ncharge.   Franklin entered a plea of not guilty to the additional\n\ncounts in the superseding indictment.\n\n           In January 2005, the district court first addressed the\n\nmotion to suppress, suggesting that there was no real need for an\n\nevidentiary hearing.       Eight months later, however, the court\n\ngranted the request for a hearing, which took place over three days\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fin November and December 2005.2       In early March 2006, having\n\nreceived no ruling from the district court, Franklin filed a motion\n\nto dismiss the indictment for violation of the Speedy Trial Act, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3162.\n\n          Finally, on March 15, 2006 — nearly a year and a half\n\nafter Franklin filed his suppression motion — the court denied the\n\nmotion on the alternate grounds that Franklin had given consent or\n\nthat the officers had probable cause to conduct the challenged\n\nsearch.   Two days later, the court denied the motion to dismiss,\n\nfinding no violation of the Speedy Trial Act.   However, following\n\na request for reconsideration, the court reversed course, found a\n\nviolation, and dismissed the indictment without prejudice.\n\n          In November 2006, a grand jury re-indicted Franklin on\n\nthree counts of cocaine possession-with-intent-to-distribute and\n\none count of felon-in-possession-of-ammunition, all stemming from\n\nthe three episodes set forth in the facts above.     Under the new\n\nindictment, Franklin moved again for dismissal, this time with\n\nprejudice, for violations of the Speedy Trial Act and the Sixth\n\nAmendment. The court denied the motion, and Franklin was convicted\n\non all counts after a six-day trial.\n\n          On appeal, Franklin raises only the Speedy Trial Act and\n\nsuppression issues.   We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n\n     2\n       The hearing, originally scheduled for November 3, 2005, was\npostponed for about two and a half weeks after Franklin was granted\na continuance.\n\n                                -9-\n\f                                   ANALYSIS\n\nSpeedy Trial Act\n\n            The Speedy Trial Act was enacted to effectuate the Sixth\n\nAmendment's right to a speedy trial in criminal prosecutions.                See\n\nUnited States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 53 (1st Cir. 2001); H.R.Rep.\n\nNo. 96-390, at 2-3 (1979), reprinted in 1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. 805, 807.\n\nThe Act provides at 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2) that \"[i]f a defendant\n\nis   not   brought   to    trial   within    the   time   limit\"   established\n\nelsewhere in the Act, then \"the information or indictment shall be\n\ndismissed on motion of the defendant.\"             Because the parties agree\n\nthat Franklin was not timely brought to trial, the issue here is\n\nwhether dismissal with prejudice is necessary under the Act.\n\n            The Act at § 3162(a)(2) speaks to this issue directly:\n\n            In determining whether to dismiss the case\n            with or without prejudice, the court shall\n            consider, among others, each of the following\n            factors: [1] the seriousness of the offense;\n            [2] the facts and circumstances of the case\n            which led to dismissal; [3] and the impact of\n            a reprosecution on the administration of this\n            chapter and on the administration of justice.\n\nIn considering the other factors adverted to in the Act, this court\n\nhas hewn to the principle that any such factors must be \"rationally\n\nrelated to the balancing objectives of the tripartite test.\"\n\nUnited States v. Hastings, 847 F.2d 920, 924 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nThus, these factors may include \"the length of the delay and the\n\nprejudice    to   the     defendant   stemming     from    the   violation   (or\n\nconversely, the absence of prejudice).\"            Id.    Indeed, we have come\n\n                                      -10-\n\fto describe prejudice to the defendant as the fourth factor for\n\ncourts to consider.   See United States v. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).   In the end, however, one policy underrides our\n\nanalysis: dismissal with prejudice is \"a last and rare resort.\"\n\nUnited States v. Dessesaure, 556 F.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          Our standard of review is abuse of discretion, see id.,\n\nbut the district court's decision is sound enough to withstand even\n\nsignificantly more searching scrutiny; indeed, it is sufficiently\n\nwell-constructed to stand on its own.       Nevertheless, we will\n\nbriefly expound on each of the factors set forth above.\n\n          First, Franklin concedes that his crime was serious, and\n\nrightly so.   Both common sense and court precedent command the\n\nconclusion that the possession on multiple occasions of large\n\nquantities of drugs and ammunition is serious.   See, e.g., id. at\n\n86.\n\n          Second, Franklin argues that the facts and circumstances\n\nof the delay in this case are like those in United States v.\n\nStayton, 791 F.2d 17 (2d Cir. 1986), where the Second Circuit held\n\nthat a 23-month delay between voir dire and swearing in the jury\n\nwarranted a dismissal with prejudice.3 Applying the second factor,\n\nthe Stayton court noted that \"the [district] court ignored the\n\npersistent prodding of the government to decide . . . outstanding\n\n\n      3\n       As Franklin does, we consider the length of delay under the\nfacts-and-circumstances prong rather than setting it out as a\nseparate factor.\n\n                               -11-\n\fmotions and proceed to trial.\"          Id. at 21.       Given that specific\n\ncontext, the court held that \"the enormity of the delay\" was enough\n\n\"to tip th[e] second factor in favor of dismissal of the indictment\n\nwith prejudice.\"    Id. at 22.\n\n            The government argues that this case is controlled by\n\nScott, 270 F.3d 30, where we held that a 124-day wait for an order\n\non a motion to suppress warranted only dismissal without prejudice.\n\nAmong the factors supporting dismissal without prejudice was our\n\ndetermination that \"the facts and circumstances of the delay do not\n\nshow any bad faith on the part of the government\"; instead, \"[t]he\n\ndelay was largely due to the district court, which acted without\n\nclear guidance by the law on the point.\"                Id. at 58.      Scott's\n\nholding reflects our practice of looking to whether there is\n\ngovernment    \"culpability\"      as    the     focus    of   our    facts-and-\n\ncircumstances analysis.        See United States v. Hastings, 847 F.2d\n\n920, 925 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n            The government is correct: Scott controls, and Stayton\n\ndoes not.    There are many reasons for this, not least of which is\n\nthat Scott is binding in this circuit while Stayton is not.\n\nAdditionally, Scott is squarely on point here: in both cases, the\n\ndelay   stemmed   from   the   court's       belated   decision    to   hold   an\n\nevidentiary hearing and then require more briefing and not from any\n\ngovernment misconduct.     See Scott, 270 F.3d at 54.             We made clear\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fin   Scott    that     these   circumstances         favor    dismissal       without\n\nprejudice.     Id. at 58.\n\n             Stayton, on the other hand, is not only non-binding but\n\nalso inapplicable here because of its vastly different facts.                        In\n\nStayton, there was no indication that the defendant bore any\n\nresponsibility for the delay, for which the reviewing court could\n\nnot discern \"a single justifying reason.\" Stayton, 791 F.2d at 20.\n\nHere,   Franklin's      responsibility         was   twofold:      he    requested    a\n\ncontinuance and later remained silent about the delay until he\n\nfiled the motion to dismiss.              See Dessesaure, 556 F.3d at 86\n\n(reversing dismissal with prejudice where \"the defendant was as\n\nwell-placed to remind the judge [about the delay] as was the\n\nprosecutor\").        Additionally, in Stayton the delay was 23 months;\n\nhere, the delay — whether 180 days, as the district court found, or\n\n234, as Franklin argues — was far shorter.              In the end, then, Scott\n\ncontrols,     Stayton    is    wholly    inapposite,         and   the     facts   and\n\ncircumstances of the delay strongly favor the government.\n\n             Third, Franklin suggests that dismissal without prejudice\n\nwould disrupt the administration of justice and of the Speedy Trial\n\nAct by effectively extracting the Act's teeth.                          This argument\n\nignores the Act's specific inclusion of dismissal without prejudice\n\nas a sanction, and that sanction's several teeth: the cost to the\n\ngovernment in bringing a new prosecution, the possibility of\n\nstatute of limitations issues, the chance of failure to re-indict,\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fand the risk of losing evidence and witnesses over time; the\n\nargument has therefore been roundly repudiated by both this court\n\nand the Supreme Court.       See United States v. Taylor, 487 U.S. 326,\n\n342   (1988)   (\"Dismissal    without   prejudice   is   not   a   toothless\n\nsanction.\"); Barnes, 159 F.3d at 17-18 (quoting same). We need say\n\nno more on that.\n\n            Fourth and finally, Franklin does not suggest how he\n\nmight have been prejudiced by the delay, instead espousing the\n\nproposition that where \"serious enough\" delay occurs, \"it [i]s\n\nunnecessary to determine the extent to which the defendant ha[s]\n\nactually been prejudiced.\" But the delay here was not extreme, and\n\nit resulted at least in part from Franklin's own request for a\n\ncontinuance and subsequent inaction.       More importantly, Franklin's\n\nsuggestion that we bypass prejudice belies a glaring weakness in\n\nhis argument: there is nothing in either the record or the briefs\n\nto indicate that he actually was prejudiced in any way by the\n\ndistrict court's delay.       Accordingly, the fourth factor tips the\n\nscale still further in the government's favor.\n\n            Thus, the record reveals a serious crime, a somewhat\n\nlengthy but innocuous delay, a just sanction, and no harm to\n\nFranklin.      Far from being an abuse of discretion, the district\n\ncourt's dismissal without prejudice was utterly appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fMotion to Suppress\n\n           The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people\n\nto be secure . . . against unreasonable searches.\"      U.S. Const.\n\namend. IV.     This right is given effect through the exclusionary\n\nrule, which \"forbids the use of improperly obtained evidence at\n\ntrial.\"    Herring v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 695, 699 (2009).\n\nHere, Franklin asserts that the drugs found in the trunk of the\n\nTaurus sedan were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment\n\nand, therefore, that the district court erred in denying his motion\n\nto suppress this evidence.    Specifically, Franklin argues that he\n\ndid not consent to the officers' search, and that the officers had\n\nneither a warrant nor probable cause to otherwise justify their\n\nactions.   We review de novo the legal questions underlying these\n\narguments, accepting as true the court's factual assessments unless\n\nclearly erroneous.     See United States v. Marshall, 348 F.3d 281,\n\n284 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           Consent\n\n           There is no dispute that a \"specifically established\n\nexception[]\" to the Fourth Amendment's \"requirements of both a\n\nwarrant and probable cause is a search that is conducted pursuant\n\nto consent.\"    United States v. Vilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218,\n\n219 (1973)) (internal quotation marks removed).   For consent to be\n\nvalid, it must be given knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fSee Marshall, 348 F.3d at 286.              This brief recitation of the law is\n\nall that is necessary here because the law is not in dispute:\n\nFranklin      has    elected     to    focus      his    attack    on   the   factual\n\ndeterminations underlying the district court's decision.\n\n              First, Franklin says that \"[t]he issue of whether [he]\n\nvoluntarily consented to the search of the trunk of his car\n\ndepended upon resolving a conflict between the testimony of two DEA\n\ntask force agents, George MacLaughlin and Michael Cashman, on the\n\none hand,\" and his own testimony, on the other.                   Franklin suggests\n\nthat the officers' testimony is so implausible that no reasonable\n\nfact-finder could possibly have subscribed to it rather than his\n\nown.   For example, Franklin asserts that \"[h]owever cooperative he\n\nappeared to be, the last thing he would have done was to tell the\n\npolice where they could find the drugs that he was supposedly\n\ntrying to hide from them.\"             And yet according to Franklin's own\n\ntestimony, he told the officers that he had gone to the car \"to\n\nsmoke some weed.\"         That weed must have come from somewhere: either\n\nhe brought it with him to the car, or it was already in the car.\n\nIn   either    case,      it   ended   up    in   the    car.     Given    Franklin's\n\ntestimony, then, it hardly seems improbable that Franklin might\n\nhave admitted to the officers that there were drugs in the car.\n\nMoreover, courts have routinely rejected the notion that testimony\n\nis implausible merely because it recounts a defendant's acting\n\nagainst    his      own   self-interest.          See,   e.g.,    United   States   v.\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fMendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 559 (1980). Overall, Franklin's attempts\n\nto draw inconsistencies and implausibilities from the officers'\n\ntestimony are barely colorable; they come nowhere near the clear\n\nerror threshold.4\n\n             Franklin's other primary argument on this point — that\n\nthe officers' testimony is suspect because it is not corroborated\n\nby a consent form — likewise holds no water.                        A consent form\n\ncertainly would have made the prosecution's task easier, but it was\n\nnot necessary, and its absence does not undercut the officers'\n\nconsistent     testimony.         Indeed,       our   case    law   is   clear   that\n\n\"[w]ritten consent is not essential to the establishment of a valid\n\nconsensual search.\"       United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 555\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n             A consent form was particularly unnecessary here given\n\nother     evidence   sufficient     to    establish       consent:    specifically,\n\nuncontested testimony that Franklin told the officers to \"do what\n\nyou   got    to   do.\"      The    district       court      concluded   that    this\n\nunenthusiastic       statement     evinced       consent,     and    given   circuit\n\nprecedent     upholding   consent     under       similar     circumstances,     this\n\n\n\n      4\n        Such is the case with Franklin's arguments that the\nofficers' testimony is implausible because (1) his comment about\nthe car being in his mother's name was a non-sequitur, and (2)\nexperienced officers would never bother asking consent to search a\ncar after a suspect has already admitted there are drugs in the\ncar. Contrary to Franklin's contentions, it is quite plausible\nthat the former was a halfhearted attempt at evasion and the latter\nwas simply belt-and-suspenders police work.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fconclusion was not clear error.        See United States v. Zapata, 18\n\nF.3d 971, 974, 977 (1st Cir. 1994) (consent clear from statement:\n\n\"Sure, go ahead\"); Barnett, 989 F.2d at 556 (consent clear from\n\nstatement: \"Go ahead; you'd probably get a search warrant anyway\").\n\nFranklin's statement, particularly viewed in light of his prior\n\nstatements about the car and his choice to surrender ammunition to\n\nthe officers, could reasonably be construed as consent.\n\n              Finally, Franklin asserts that this case is factually\n\nsimilar to United States v. Escobar, 389 F.3d 781 (8th Cir. 2004),\n\nin which a panel of the Eighth Circuit held that the defendants'\n\nconsent to a search of their luggage was not voluntary because they\n\nhad simply \"acquiesced to the search believing [they] had no\n\nchoice.\"      Id. at 786.   However, Escobar neither binds us nor offers\n\nus any persuasive value given the utterly distinct facts of this\n\ncase.       In Escobar, the police knew nothing about the defendants,\n\nwho were random bus passengers subject to a general sweep, or their\n\ncriminal history, see id. at 782-83; here, officers knew Franklin\n\n— including his criminal history and his consequent familiarity\n\nwith criminal procedure — quite well, having spent about a year\n\nbuilding a drug case against him.5         In Escobar, officers lied to\n\nthe defendants and claimed that drug-detection dogs had already\n\n\n\n        5\n       Actually, the officers' familiarity stretched far past the\ninvestigation giving rise to this case; at the time of Franklin's\narrest, for example, Detective Fratalia had maintained a cordial if\nadversarial working relationship with him \"since the late 1980s.\"\n\n                                    -18-\n\falerted to their luggage, see id. at 783, 786; here, the police did\n\nnot lie to Franklin — even Franklin's own account demonstrates a\n\ncandid conversation in which he freely admitted to having marijuana\n\nin the car that was searched.              And, most importantly, in Escobar,\n\nthe officers did not advise the passengers of any of their rights,\n\nsee id. at 783, 786; here, Franklin was immediately advised of his\n\nMiranda rights — including the right to remain silent — and he\n\nindicated he understood those rights. Thus, the circumstances that\n\nthe court found were relevant to the Escobar defendants' \"believing\n\n[they] had no choice\" — lack of demonstrated familiarity with\n\ncriminal procedure, lies designed to elicit consent, and no notice\n\nof   a       right   to    remain    silent     —    were     entirely   absent    here.6\n\nFranklin's reliance on Escobar is misplaced, and it was not clear\n\nerror for the district court to find Franklin’s consent voluntary.\n\n                Probable Cause\n\n                Even      if   the   district       court's    consent   finding    were\n\nquestionable — and the above discussion should make clear that it\n\nis not — the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant\n\nrequirement would vindicate the officers' search because the agents\n\nhad probable cause to believe that the Taurus contained drugs. See\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, 380 F.3d 538, 543 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"A\n\n\n         6\n       We reject the notion that the district court clearly erred\nwhen it found that the officers had not threatened to tow\nFranklin's car and obtain a search warrant. However, even assuming\nsuch an error, the facts and circumstances spelled out above would\nstill overwhelmingly favor a finding of consent.\n\n                                          -19-\n\fwarrantless search of an automobile will be upheld if 'officers\n\nhave   probable    cause     to   believe   that   the   vehicle    contains\n\ncontraband.'\") (quoting United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 808\n\n(1982)).     To put it briefly: the agents testified Franklin told\n\nthem there was marijuana in the car; the district court credited\n\nthe agents' version of events in finding probable cause; and we\n\nhave already held that the district court's factual findings are\n\nfar from clearly erroneous.        Thus, the probable cause question is\n\nquickly dispatched.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n           The    district   court   adequately    addressed   an   admitted\n\nSpeedy Trial Act violation by dismissing Franklin's charges without\n\nprejudice.    Franklin's conviction was properly based in part on a\n\nvehicle search that was legal in every respect.            Accordingly, we\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f",

On appeal, Franklin seeks to overturn those convictions, alleging an illegal search and an overly long time to trial. After careful consideration, we agree with the district court's disposition of both issues. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Drugs and Ammunition</h2>\n<p>In 2003, federal, state, and local authorities began conducting a coordinated investigation of the drug trade around the Warren Gardens housing complex in the Roxbury section of Boston.<sup>[1]</sup> Franklin's reputation as a mid-level supplier of crack cocaine to street dealers led law enforcement to peg him as a primary target. Looking to nab the cautious Franklin on concrete charges, law enforcement set up two controlled buys of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p>The first controlled buy occurred on July 10, 2003. On Copeland Street in Roxbury, an undercover Boston police officer approached a street dealer from whom he had previously purchased crack cocaine. Queried about the availability of crack cocaine, the dealer shook hands with the officer, told him to sit on a nearby set of stairs, and then walked over to a dark-colored minivan. The dealer spoke with two individuals in the van, one of whom was later identified as Franklin. Apparently fearful of surveillancerightly so, given that the Copeland Street interactions were being recorded on video Franklin told the dealer to move to a more discreet location before consummating the deal. The officer and the dealer crossed Warren Street and ended up on Rockland Street in the Warren Gardens complex, where (a detective would later testify) it is nearly impossible to conduct surveillance. The van arrived at Rockland Street moments later. The dealer approached the van, and Franklin passed a plastic bag to the van's other occupant, who then handed the bag to the dealer through the van's open window. The dealer removed a rock-like material from the bag, cut off a chunk, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> and handed it to the officer. In return, the officer gave $150 to the dealer, who then got into the van's back seat. As the van pulled away, the officer saw the dealer pass the money to Franklin. The chunk of rock-like material was later determined to contain a net weight of 1.3 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p>The second controlled buy took place on March 12, 2004. This time, law enforcement employed a confidential informant (\"CI\") to arrange a more substantial purchase from Franklinthe goal was an ounce, or roughly 28 grams of crack cocaine. With an officer present, the CI twice tried to reach Franklin by phone before he called her back. The CI and Franklin arranged a deal to take place at the Presidential Acres apartment complex in Randolph, Massachusetts, where Franklin's mother lived. Specifically, the CI asked for \"a full one\"referring to an ouncewhich Franklin said he'd sell her for \"a G\"referring to $1000. Officers searched the CI and her vehicle and found no drugs or money; they then provided her with $1000 in government money and placed a radio transmitter in her vehicle, on the driver's side visor.</p>\n<p>The CI traveled to the appointed location in Randolph and parked by the pool. Officers were posted at various places around the apartment complex, monitoring audio from the CI's vehicle and recording video of Franklin. The officers' surveillance revealed that Franklin exited his mother's apartment, got into a brown vehicle, and drove to meet the CI by the pool. Franklin got out of his vehicle and into the CI's. The two of them conversed for a couple of minutes, and then Franklin got back into his vehicle and left. The CI also drove away, followed by a DEA agent. About a mile away from the apartment complex, the CI and the agent pulled over, and the CI handed over to the agent bags containing a rock-like substance. The rock-like substance was later determined to contain a net weight of 26.5 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p>On April 14, 2004, the government was ready to move in on Franklin: a grand jury returned an indictment charging him with three counts of cocaine possession with intent to distribute, and the court issued a warrant for his arrest. That very night, Detective Robert Fratalia set up a post at 159 Pine Grove Drive in Brockton, Massachusetts, where Franklin was living with then-girlfriend Fania Hemingway and her two children. Fratalia surveilled both the apartment complex's courtyard and a blue Ford Taurus sedan that was registered to Franklin's mother and that he had previously seen Franklin drive. Detective (and deputized federal agent) George MacLaughlin<sup>[2]</sup> and Agent Michael Cashman were also posted separately nearby.</p>\n<p>At around 11:30 p.m., an individual fitting Franklin's descriptiona black man, around 30 years old, six feet tall or so, and probably 270 or 280 poundsemerged from the courtyard and got into the front seat of a white sedan, which then drove away. The car returned about half an hour later, and the individual headed into the courtyard and out of Fratalia's sight. About an hour after that, the same individual emerged again, this time carrying a shopping bag, which he placed in the trunk of the blue Ford Taurus sedan. He got into the Taurus's driver seat, started the car, and began to pull away but stopped almost immediately; then he waited a couple of minutes, got out of the car, locked it, and returned to the courtyard.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> By around 5:30 a.m. on April 15, 2004, a SWAT team had arrived to arrest Franklin, who (law enforcement had reasonably concluded) was the individual Fratalia had observed. The team surrounded the apartment complex. Officer Brian Cahoon, a member of the SWAT team, used a cell phone to call into Franklin's apartment. Hemingway answered the phone and then passed it to Franklin. Cahoon told Franklin that the apartment was surrounded, so Franklin prepared to surrender: he got dressed, gathered his phone, his keys, and some loose cash, and then came out carrying a plastic bag full of ammunition. He was directed to leave his belongings on the ground and to crawl on all fours toward nearby officers; he was then placed in plastic cuffs and taken into custody.</p>\n<p>Franklin was brought to MacLaughlin and Cashman, who introduced themselves and advised him of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Franklin said he understood. By all accounts, the agents told Franklin that he had been observed placing a plastic bag in the trunk of the blue Ford Taurus. Here, however, the record diverges a bit.</p>\n<p>According to Cashman, the agents asked Franklin if he would consent to a search of the car. Franklin skirted the issue by responding that the car was his mother's. Cashman then asked him what was in the plastic bag; Franklin said it was a little weed. Cashman followed up by asking why he had placed a little weed in the car; Franklin said he had heard that his people were getting arrested, and he wanted to protect his girlfriend by removing any contraband from the apartment. Having secured this information, Cashman repeated his initial request that Franklin consent to a search of the car. Franklin replied, \"Yeah, do what you got to do.\" Cashman testified specifically that the agents did not tell Franklin that they would get a warrant to search the car if he did not consent.</p>\n<p>According to MacLaughlin, the conversation went more or less as Cashman testified. Under MacLaughlin's version of events, however, Franklin only explained why he had placed the marijuana in the trunk of the Taurusto protect his girlfriendafter telling the agents to \"do what you got to do.\"</p>\n<p>According to Franklin, however, the agents first asked him what he had been doing in the car at night. Franklin told them that he \"was just going out to my car to smoke some weed.\" They asked what was in the bag that he had placed in the trunk. He replied, \"some sneakers.\" Then the agents asked whether they could search the car, to which Franklin replied, \"no.\" After conferring with one another, the agents asked Franklin whether the car was his mother's. He replied that the car was his but was registered to his mother. Stymied, MacLaughlin said, \"Well, you know we could tow the car until we get a search warrant.\" Only at this point did Franklin offer the response that the officers took as consent: \"Well, do what you got to do then.\"</p>\n<p>On the basis of Franklin's apparent consent, MacLaughlin retrieved the keys to the Taurus from Hemingway. The agents searched the car, finding a bag in the trunk. The bag contained a shoe box, the shoe box contained a smaller bag, and that bag contained 66 grams of crack cocaine and 91 grams of marijuana.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Pretrial Procedural Hiccups</h2>\n<p>On April 20, 2004, Franklin entered a plea of not guilty, and on October 14, 2004, he moved to suppress the fruits of the agents' search of the car, arguing that he had not actually consented to the search. Franklin also requested an evidentiary hearing on the issue. The government opposed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> the motion and argued that there was no need for a hearing.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, on October 28, 2004, Franklin was also indicted on another possession-with-intent-to-distribute charge, this time stemming from the drugs the agents found in the car; the new indictment also added a felon-in-possession-of-ammunition charge. Franklin entered a plea of not guilty to the additional counts in the superseding indictment.</p>\n<p>In January 2005, the district court first addressed the motion to suppress, suggesting that there was no real need for an evidentiary hearing. Eight months later, however, the court granted the request for a hearing, which took place over three days in November and December 2005.<sup>[3]</sup> In early March 2006, having received no ruling from the district court, Franklin filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for violation of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3162.</p>\n<p>Finally, on March 15, 2006nearly a year and a half after Franklin filed his suppression motionthe court denied the motion on the alternate grounds that Franklin had given consent or that the officers had probable cause to conduct the challenged search. Two days later, the court denied the motion to dismiss, finding no violation of the Speedy Trial Act. However, following a request for reconsideration, the court reversed course, found a violation, and dismissed the indictment without prejudice.</p>\n<p>In November 2006, a grand jury re-indicted Franklin on three counts of cocaine possession-with-intent-to-distribute and one count of felon-in-possession-of-ammunition, all stemming from the three episodes set forth in the facts above. Under the new indictment, Franklin moved again for dismissal, this time with prejudice, for violations of the Speedy Trial Act and the Sixth Amendment. The court denied the motion, and Franklin was convicted on all counts after a six-day trial.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Franklin raises only the Speedy Trial Act and suppression issues. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Speedy Trial Act</h2>\n<p>The Speedy Trial Act was enacted to effectuate the Sixth Amendment's right to a speedy trial in criminal prosecutions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Scott,</i> 270 F.3d 30, 53 (1st Cir.2001); H.R.Rep. No. 96-390, at 2-3 (1979), <i>reprinted in</i> 1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. 805, 807. The Act provides at 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2) that \"[i]f a defendant is not brought to trial within the time limit\" established elsewhere in the Act, then \"the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.\" Because the parties agree that Franklin was not timely brought to trial, the issue here is whether dismissal with prejudice is necessary under the Act.</p>\n<p>The Act at § 3162(a)(2) speaks to this issue directly:</p>\n<blockquote>In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors: [1] the seriousness of the offense; [2] the facts and circumstances of the case which led to dismissal; [3] and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p>In considering the other factors adverted to in the Act, this court has hewn to the principle that any such factors must be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> \"rationally related to the balancing objectives of the tripartite test.\" <i>United States v. Hastings,</i> 847 F.2d 920, 924 (1st Cir. 1988). Thus, these factors may include \"the length of the delay and the prejudice to the defendant stemming from the violation (or conversely, the absence of prejudice).\" <i>Id.</i> Indeed, we have come to describe prejudice to the defendant as the fourth factor for courts to consider. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Barnes,</i> 159 F.3d 4, 16 (1st Cir.1998). In the end, however, one policy underrides our analysis: dismissal with prejudice is \"a last and rare resort.\" <i>United States v. Dessesaure,</i> 556 F.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Our standard of review is abuse of discretion, <i>see id.,</i> but the district court's decision is sound enough to withstand even significantly more searching scrutiny; indeed, it is sufficiently well-constructed to stand on its own. Nevertheless, we will briefly expound on each of the factors set forth above.</p>\n<p>First, Franklin concedes that his crime was serious, and rightly so. Both common sense and court precedent command the conclusion that the possession on multiple occasions of large quantities of drugs and ammunition is serious. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 86.</p>\n<p>Second, Franklin argues that the facts and circumstances of the delay in this case are like those in <i>United States v. Stayton,</i> 791 F.2d 17 (2d Cir.1986), where the Second Circuit held that a 23-month delay between voir dire and swearing in the jury warranted a dismissal with prejudice.<sup>[4]</sup> Applying the second factor, the <i>Stayton</i> court noted that \"the [district] court ignored the persistent prodding of the government to decide ... outstanding motions and proceed to trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21. Given that specific context, the court held that \"the enormity of the delay\" was enough \"to tip th[e] second factor in favor of dismissal of the indictment with prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n<p>The government argues that this case is controlled by <i>Scott,</i> 270 F.3d 30, where we held that a 124-day wait for an order on a motion to suppress warranted only dismissal without prejudice. Among the factors supporting dismissal without prejudice was our determination that \"the facts and circumstances of the delay do not show any bad faith on the part of the government\"; instead, \"[t]he delay was largely due to the district court, which acted without clear guidance by the law on the point.\" <i>Id.</i> at 58. <i>Scott's</i> holding reflects our practice of looking to whether there is government \"culpability\" as the focus of our facts-and-circumstances analysis. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hastings,</i> 847 F.2d 920, 925 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>The government is correct: <i>Scott</i> controls, and <i>Stayton</i> does not. There are many reasons for this, not least of which is that <i>Scott</i> is binding in this circuit while <i>Stayton</i> is not. Additionally, <i>Scott</i> is squarely on point here: in both cases, the delay stemmed from the court's belated decision to hold an evidentiary hearing and then require more briefing and not from any government misconduct. <i>See </i><i>Scott,</i> 270 F.3d at 54. We made clear in <i>Scott</i> that these circumstances favor dismissal without prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 58.</p>\n<p><i>Stayton,</i> on the other hand, is not only non-binding but also inapplicable here because of its vastly different facts. In <i>Stayton,</i> there was no indication that the defendant bore any responsibility for the delay, for which the reviewing court could not discern \"a single justifying reason.\" <i>Stayton,</i> 791 F.2d at 20. Here, Franklin's responsibility was twofold: he requested a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> continuance and later remained silent about the delay until he filed the motion to dismiss. <i>See </i><i>Dessesaure,</i> 556 F.3d at 86 (reversing dismissal with prejudice where \"the defendant was as well-placed to remind the judge [about the delay] as was the prosecutor\"). Additionally, in <i>Stayton</i> the delay was 23 months; here, the delaywhether 180 days, as the district court found, or 234, as Franklin argues was far shorter. In the end, then, <i>Scott</i> controls, <i>Stayton</i> is wholly inapposite, and the facts and circumstances of the delay strongly favor the government.</p>\n<p>Third, Franklin suggests that dismissal without prejudice would disrupt the administration of justice and of the Speedy Trial Act by effectively extracting the Act's teeth. This argument ignores the Act's specific inclusion of dismissal without prejudice as a sanction, and that sanction's several teeth: the cost to the government in bringing a new prosecution, the possibility of statute of limitations issues, the chance of failure to re-indict, and the risk of losing evidence and witnesses over time; the argument has therefore been roundly repudiated by both this court and the Supreme Court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 487 U.S. 326, 342, 108 S.Ct. 2413, 101 L.Ed.2d 297 (1988) (\"Dismissal without prejudice is not a toothless sanction.\"); <i>Barnes,</i> 159 F.3d at 17-18 (quoting same). We need say no more on that.</p>\n<p>Fourth and finally, Franklin does not suggest how he might have been prejudiced by the delay, instead espousing the proposition that where \"serious enough\" delay occurs, \"it [i]s unnecessary to determine the extent to which the defendant ha[s] actually been prejudiced.\" But the delay here was not extreme, and it resulted at least in part from Franklin's own request for a continuance and subsequent inaction. More importantly, Franklin's suggestion that we bypass prejudice belies a glaring weakness in his argument: there is nothing in either the record or the briefs to indicate that he actually was prejudiced in any way by the district court's delay. Accordingly, the fourth factor tips the scale still further in the government's favor.</p>\n<p>Thus, the record reveals a serious crime, a somewhat lengthy but innocuous delay, a just sanction, and no harm to Franklin. Far from being an abuse of discretion, the district court's dismissal without prejudice was utterly appropriate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure ... against unreasonable searches.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. This right is given effect through the exclusionary rule, which \"forbids the use of improperly obtained evidence at trial.\" <i>Herring v. United States,</i> 555 U.S. 135, 129 S.Ct. 695, 699, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009). Here, Franklin asserts that the drugs found in the trunk of the Taurus sedan were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and, therefore, that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress this evidence. Specifically, Franklin argues that he did not consent to the officers' search, and that the officers had neither a warrant nor probable cause to otherwise justify their actions. We review de novo the legal questions underlying these arguments, accepting as true the court's factual assessments unless clearly erroneous. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marshall,</i> 348 F.3d 281, 284 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Consent</i></h2>\n<p>There is no dispute that a \"specifically established exception[]\" to the Fourth Amendment's \"requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search that is conducted pursuant to consent.\" <i>United States v. Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 523 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> <i>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,</i> 412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973)) (internal quotation marks removed). For consent to be valid, it must be given knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. <i>See </i><i>Marshall,</i> 348 F.3d at 286. This brief recitation of the law is all that is necessary here because the law is not in dispute: Franklin has elected to focus his attack on the factual determinations underlying the district court's decision.</p>\n<p>First, Franklin says that \"[t]he issue of whether [he] voluntarily consented to the search of the trunk of his car depended upon resolving a conflict between the testimony of two DEA task force agents, George MacLaughlin and Michael Cashman, on the one hand,\" and his own testimony, on the other. Franklin suggests that the officers' testimony is so implausible that no reasonable fact-finder could possibly have subscribed to it rather than his own. For example, Franklin asserts that \"[h]owever cooperative he appeared to be, the last thing he would have done was to tell the police where they could find the drugs that he was supposedly trying to hide from them.\" And yet according to Franklin's own testimony, he told the officers that he had gone to the car \"to smoke some weed.\" That weed must have come from somewhere: either he brought it with him to the car, or it was already in the car. In either case, it ended up in the car. Given Franklin's testimony, then, it hardly seems improbable that Franklin might have admitted to the officers that there were drugs in the car. Moreover, courts have routinely rejected the notion that testimony is implausible merely because it recounts a defendant's acting against his own self-interest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Mendenhall,</i> 446 U.S. 544, 559, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980). Overall, Franklin's attempts to draw inconsistencies and implausibilities from the officers' testimony are barely colorable; they come nowhere near the clear error threshold.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Franklin's other primary argument on this pointthat the officers' testimony is suspect because it is not corroborated by a consent formlikewise holds no water. A consent form certainly would have made the prosecution's task easier, but it was not necessary, and its absence does not undercut the officers' consistent testimony. Indeed, our case law is clear that \"[w]ritten consent is not essential to the establishment of a valid consensual search.\" <i>United States v. Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d 546, 555 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>A consent form was particularly unnecessary here given other evidence sufficient to establish consent: specifically, uncontested testimony that Franklin told the officers to \"do what you got to do.\" The district court concluded that this unenthusiastic statement evinced consent, and given circuit precedent upholding consent under similar circumstances, this conclusion was not clear error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d 971, 974, 977 (1st Cir. 1994) (consent clear from statement: \"Sure, go ahead\"); <i>Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d at 556 (consent clear from statement: \"Go ahead; you'd probably get a search warrant anyway\"). Franklin's statement, particularly viewed in light of his prior statements about the car and his choice to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> surrender ammunition to the officers, could reasonably be construed as consent.</p>\n<p>Finally, Franklin asserts that this case is factually similar to <i>United States v. Escobar,</i> 389 F.3d 781 (8th Cir.2004), in which a panel of the Eighth Circuit held that the defendants' consent to a search of their luggage was not voluntary because they had simply \"acquiesced to the search believing [they] had no choice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 786. However, <i>Escobar</i> neither binds us nor offers us any persuasive value given the utterly distinct facts of this case. In <i>Escobar,</i> the police knew nothing about the defendants, who were random bus passengers subject to a general sweep, or their criminal history, <i>see id.</i> at 782-83; here, officers knew Franklinincluding his criminal history and his consequent familiarity with criminal procedurequite well, having spent about a year building a drug case against him.<sup>[6]</sup> In <i>Escobar,</i> officers lied to the defendants and claimed that drug-detection dogs had already alerted to their luggage, <i>see id.</i> at 783, 786; here, the police did not lie to Franklineven Franklin's own account demonstrates a candid conversation in which he freely admitted to having marijuana in the car that was searched. And, most importantly, in <i>Escobar,</i> the officers did not advise the passengers of any of their rights, <i>see id.</i> at 783, 786; here, Franklin was immediately advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rightsincluding the right to remain silentand he indicated he understood those rights. Thus, the circumstances that the court found were relevant to the <i>Escobar</i> defendants' \"believing [they] had no choice\"lack of demonstrated familiarity with criminal procedure, lies designed to elicit consent, and no notice of a right to remain silentwere entirely absent here.<sup>[7]</sup> Franklin's reliance on <i>Escobar</i> is misplaced, and it was not clear error for the district court to find Franklin's consent voluntary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Probable Cause</i></h2>\n<p>Even if the district court's consent finding were questionableand the above discussion should make clear that it is notthe automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement would vindicate the officers' search because the agents had probable cause to believe that the Taurus contained drugs. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 380 F.3d 538, 543 (1st Cir.2004) (\"A warrantless search of an automobile will be upheld if `officers have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Ross,</i> 456 U.S. 798, 808, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982)). To put it briefly: the agents testified Franklin told them there was marijuana in the car; the district court credited the agents' version of events in finding probable cause; and we have already held that the district court's factual findings are far from clearly erroneous. Thus, the probable cause question is quickly dispatched.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The district court adequately addressed an admitted Speedy Trial Act violation by dismissing Franklin's charges without prejudice. Franklin's conviction was properly based in part on a vehicle search that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> was legal in every respect. Accordingly, we <i>affirm.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Authorities involved in the investigation included the Boston Housing Police, the Boston Police (specifically the Youth Violence Task Force, or gang unit), the Massachusetts State Police, the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>\n<p>[2]  The record includes both McLaughlin and MacLaughlin as spellings of the detective's name; we choose the more frequently occurring MacLaughlin.</p>\n<p>[3]  The hearing, originally scheduled for November 3, 2005, was postponed for about two and a half weeks after Franklin was granted a continuance.</p>\n<p>[4]  As Franklin does, we consider the length of delay under the facts-and-circumstances prong rather than setting it out as a separate factor.</p>\n<p>[5]  Such is the case with Franklin's arguments that the officers' testimony is implausible because (1) his comment about the car being in his mother's name was a non-sequitur, and (2) experienced officers would never bother asking consent to search a car after a suspect has already admitted there are drugs in the car. Contrary to Franklin's contentions, it is quite plausible that the former was a halfhearted attempt at evasion and the latter was simply belt-and-suspenders police work.</p>\n<p>[6]  Actually, the officers' familiarity stretched far past the investigation giving rise to this case; at the time of Franklin's arrest, for example, Detective Fratalia had maintained a cordial if adversarial working relationship with him \"since the late 1980s.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  We reject the notion that the district court clearly erred when it found that the officers had not threatened to tow Franklin's car and obtain a search warrant. However, even assuming such an error, the facts and circumstances spelled out above would still overwhelmingly favor a finding of consent.</p>\n\n</div>",

On appeal, Franklin seeks to overturn those convictions, alleging an illegal search and an overly long time to trial. After careful consideration, we agree with the district court's disposition of both issues. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Drugs and Ammunition</h2>\n<p>In 2003, federal, state, and local authorities began conducting a coordinated investigation of the drug trade around the Warren Gardens housing complex in the Roxbury section of Boston.<sup>[1]</sup> Franklin's reputation as a mid-level supplier of crack cocaine to street dealers led law enforcement to peg him as a primary target. Looking to nab the cautious Franklin on concrete charges, law enforcement set up two controlled buys of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p>The first controlled buy occurred on July 10, 2003. On Copeland Street in Roxbury, an undercover Boston police officer approached a street dealer from whom he had previously purchased crack cocaine. Queried about the availability of crack cocaine, the dealer shook hands with the officer, told him to sit on a nearby set of stairs, and then walked over to a dark-colored minivan. The dealer spoke with two individuals in the van, one of whom was later identified as Franklin. Apparently fearful of surveillancerightly so, given that the Copeland Street interactions were being recorded on video Franklin told the dealer to move to a more discreet location before consummating the deal. The officer and the dealer crossed Warren Street and ended up on Rockland Street in the Warren Gardens complex, where (a detective would later testify) it is nearly impossible to conduct surveillance. The van arrived at Rockland Street moments later. The dealer approached the van, and Franklin passed a plastic bag to the van's other occupant, who then handed the bag to the dealer through the van's open window. The dealer removed a rock-like material from the bag, cut off a chunk, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> and handed it to the officer. In return, the officer gave $150 to the dealer, who then got into the van's back seat. As the van pulled away, the officer saw the dealer pass the money to Franklin. The chunk of rock-like material was later determined to contain a net weight of 1.3 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p>The second controlled buy took place on March 12, 2004. This time, law enforcement employed a confidential informant (\"CI\") to arrange a more substantial purchase from Franklinthe goal was an ounce, or roughly 28 grams of crack cocaine. With an officer present, the CI twice tried to reach Franklin by phone before he called her back. The CI and Franklin arranged a deal to take place at the Presidential Acres apartment complex in Randolph, Massachusetts, where Franklin's mother lived. Specifically, the CI asked for \"a full one\"referring to an ouncewhich Franklin said he'd sell her for \"a G\"referring to $1000. Officers searched the CI and her vehicle and found no drugs or money; they then provided her with $1000 in government money and placed a radio transmitter in her vehicle, on the driver's side visor.</p>\n<p>The CI traveled to the appointed location in Randolph and parked by the pool. Officers were posted at various places around the apartment complex, monitoring audio from the CI's vehicle and recording video of Franklin. The officers' surveillance revealed that Franklin exited his mother's apartment, got into a brown vehicle, and drove to meet the CI by the pool. Franklin got out of his vehicle and into the CI's. The two of them conversed for a couple of minutes, and then Franklin got back into his vehicle and left. The CI also drove away, followed by a DEA agent. About a mile away from the apartment complex, the CI and the agent pulled over, and the CI handed over to the agent bags containing a rock-like substance. The rock-like substance was later determined to contain a net weight of 26.5 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p>On April 14, 2004, the government was ready to move in on Franklin: a grand jury returned an indictment charging him with three counts of cocaine possession with intent to distribute, and the court issued a warrant for his arrest. That very night, Detective Robert Fratalia set up a post at 159 Pine Grove Drive in Brockton, Massachusetts, where Franklin was living with then-girlfriend Fania Hemingway and her two children. Fratalia surveilled both the apartment complex's courtyard and a blue Ford Taurus sedan that was registered to Franklin's mother and that he had previously seen Franklin drive. Detective (and deputized federal agent) George MacLaughlin<sup>[2]</sup> and Agent Michael Cashman were also posted separately nearby.</p>\n<p>At around 11:30 p.m., an individual fitting Franklin's descriptiona black man, around 30 years old, six feet tall or so, and probably 270 or 280 poundsemerged from the courtyard and got into the front seat of a white sedan, which then drove away. The car returned about half an hour later, and the individual headed into the courtyard and out of Fratalia's sight. About an hour after that, the same individual emerged again, this time carrying a shopping bag, which he placed in the trunk of the blue Ford Taurus sedan. He got into the Taurus's driver seat, started the car, and began to pull away but stopped almost immediately; then he waited a couple of minutes, got out of the car, locked it, and returned to the courtyard.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> By around 5:30 a.m. on April 15, 2004, a SWAT team had arrived to arrest Franklin, who (law enforcement had reasonably concluded) was the individual Fratalia had observed. The team surrounded the apartment complex. Officer Brian Cahoon, a member of the SWAT team, used a cell phone to call into Franklin's apartment. Hemingway answered the phone and then passed it to Franklin. Cahoon told Franklin that the apartment was surrounded, so Franklin prepared to surrender: he got dressed, gathered his phone, his keys, and some loose cash, and then came out carrying a plastic bag full of ammunition. He was directed to leave his belongings on the ground and to crawl on all fours toward nearby officers; he was then placed in plastic cuffs and taken into custody.</p>\n<p>Franklin was brought to MacLaughlin and Cashman, who introduced themselves and advised him of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Franklin said he understood. By all accounts, the agents told Franklin that he had been observed placing a plastic bag in the trunk of the blue Ford Taurus. Here, however, the record diverges a bit.</p>\n<p>According to Cashman, the agents asked Franklin if he would consent to a search of the car. Franklin skirted the issue by responding that the car was his mother's. Cashman then asked him what was in the plastic bag; Franklin said it was a little weed. Cashman followed up by asking why he had placed a little weed in the car; Franklin said he had heard that his people were getting arrested, and he wanted to protect his girlfriend by removing any contraband from the apartment. Having secured this information, Cashman repeated his initial request that Franklin consent to a search of the car. Franklin replied, \"Yeah, do what you got to do.\" Cashman testified specifically that the agents did not tell Franklin that they would get a warrant to search the car if he did not consent.</p>\n<p>According to MacLaughlin, the conversation went more or less as Cashman testified. Under MacLaughlin's version of events, however, Franklin only explained why he had placed the marijuana in the trunk of the Taurusto protect his girlfriendafter telling the agents to \"do what you got to do.\"</p>\n<p>According to Franklin, however, the agents first asked him what he had been doing in the car at night. Franklin told them that he \"was just going out to my car to smoke some weed.\" They asked what was in the bag that he had placed in the trunk. He replied, \"some sneakers.\" Then the agents asked whether they could search the car, to which Franklin replied, \"no.\" After conferring with one another, the agents asked Franklin whether the car was his mother's. He replied that the car was his but was registered to his mother. Stymied, MacLaughlin said, \"Well, you know we could tow the car until we get a search warrant.\" Only at this point did Franklin offer the response that the officers took as consent: \"Well, do what you got to do then.\"</p>\n<p>On the basis of Franklin's apparent consent, MacLaughlin retrieved the keys to the Taurus from Hemingway. The agents searched the car, finding a bag in the trunk. The bag contained a shoe box, the shoe box contained a smaller bag, and that bag contained 66 grams of crack cocaine and 91 grams of marijuana.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Pretrial Procedural Hiccups</h2>\n<p>On April 20, 2004, Franklin entered a plea of not guilty, and on October 14, 2004, he moved to suppress the fruits of the agents' search of the car, arguing that he had not actually consented to the search. Franklin also requested an evidentiary hearing on the issue. The government opposed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> the motion and argued that there was no need for a hearing.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, on October 28, 2004, Franklin was also indicted on another possession-with-intent-to-distribute charge, this time stemming from the drugs the agents found in the car; the new indictment also added a felon-in-possession-of-ammunition charge. Franklin entered a plea of not guilty to the additional counts in the superseding indictment.</p>\n<p>In January 2005, the district court first addressed the motion to suppress, suggesting that there was no real need for an evidentiary hearing. Eight months later, however, the court granted the request for a hearing, which took place over three days in November and December 2005.<sup>[3]</sup> In early March 2006, having received no ruling from the district court, Franklin filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for violation of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3162.</p>\n<p>Finally, on March 15, 2006nearly a year and a half after Franklin filed his suppression motionthe court denied the motion on the alternate grounds that Franklin had given consent or that the officers had probable cause to conduct the challenged search. Two days later, the court denied the motion to dismiss, finding no violation of the Speedy Trial Act. However, following a request for reconsideration, the court reversed course, found a violation, and dismissed the indictment without prejudice.</p>\n<p>In November 2006, a grand jury re-indicted Franklin on three counts of cocaine possession-with-intent-to-distribute and one count of felon-in-possession-of-ammunition, all stemming from the three episodes set forth in the facts above. Under the new indictment, Franklin moved again for dismissal, this time with prejudice, for violations of the Speedy Trial Act and the Sixth Amendment. The court denied the motion, and Franklin was convicted on all counts after a six-day trial.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Franklin raises only the Speedy Trial Act and suppression issues. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Speedy Trial Act</h2>\n<p>The Speedy Trial Act was enacted to effectuate the Sixth Amendment's right to a speedy trial in criminal prosecutions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775404\"><a href=\"/opinion/775404/united-states-v-alan-n-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2001); H.R.Rep. No. 96-390, at 2-3 (1979), <i>reprinted in</i> 1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. 805, 807. The Act provides at 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2) that \"[i]f a defendant is not brought to trial within the time limit\" established elsewhere in the Act, then \"the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.\" Because the parties agree that Franklin was not timely brought to trial, the issue here is whether dismissal with prejudice is necessary under the Act.</p>\n<p>The Act at § 3162(a)(2) speaks to this issue directly:</p>\n<blockquote>In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors: [1] the seriousness of the offense; [2] the facts and circumstances of the case which led to dismissal; [3] and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p>In considering the other factors adverted to in the Act, this court has hewn to the principle that any such factors must be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> \"rationally related to the balancing objectives of the tripartite test.\" <i>United States v. Hastings,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506587\"><a href=\"/opinion/506587/united-states-v-kenneth-s-hastings/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 924 (1st Cir. 1988). Thus, these factors may include \"the length of the delay and the prejudice to the defendant stemming from the violation (or conversely, the absence of prejudice).\" <i>Id.</i> Indeed, we have come to describe prejudice to the defendant as the fourth factor for courts to consider. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Barnes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198181\"><a href=\"/opinion/198181/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1998). In the end, however, one policy underrides our analysis: dismissal with prejudice is \"a last and rare resort.\" <i>United States v. Dessesaure,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></span>, 85 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Our standard of review is abuse of discretion, <i>see id.,</i> but the district court's decision is sound enough to withstand even significantly more searching scrutiny; indeed, it is sufficiently well-constructed to stand on its own. Nevertheless, we will briefly expound on each of the factors set forth above.</p>\n<p>First, Franklin concedes that his crime was serious, and rightly so. Both common sense and court precedent command the conclusion that the possession on multiple occasions of large quantities of drugs and ammunition is serious. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 86.</p>\n<p>Second, Franklin argues that the facts and circumstances of the delay in this case are like those in <i>United States v. Stayton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"470103\"><a href=\"/opinion/470103/united-states-v-john-stayton-aka-john-gallagher/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1986), where the Second Circuit held that a 23-month delay between voir dire and swearing in the jury warranted a dismissal with prejudice.<sup>[4]</sup> Applying the second factor, the <i>Stayton</i> court noted that \"the [district] court ignored the persistent prodding of the government to decide ... outstanding motions and proceed to trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21. Given that specific context, the court held that \"the enormity of the delay\" was enough \"to tip th[e] second factor in favor of dismissal of the indictment with prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n<p>The government argues that this case is controlled by <i>Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775404\"><a href=\"/opinion/775404/united-states-v-alan-n-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, where we held that a 124-day wait for an order on a motion to suppress warranted only dismissal without prejudice. Among the factors supporting dismissal without prejudice was our determination that \"the facts and circumstances of the delay do not show any bad faith on the part of the government\"; instead, \"[t]he delay was largely due to the district court, which acted without clear guidance by the law on the point.\" <i>Id.</i> at 58. <i>Scott's</i> holding reflects our practice of looking to whether there is government \"culpability\" as the focus of our facts-and-circumstances analysis. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hastings,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506587\"><a href=\"/opinion/506587/united-states-v-kenneth-s-hastings/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 925 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>The government is correct: <i>Scott</i> controls, and <i>Stayton</i> does not. There are many reasons for this, not least of which is that <i>Scott</i> is binding in this circuit while <i>Stayton</i> is not. Additionally, <i>Scott</i> is squarely on point here: in both cases, the delay stemmed from the court's belated decision to hold an evidentiary hearing and then require more briefing and not from any government misconduct. <i>See </i><i>Scott,</i> 270 F.3d at 54. We made clear in <i>Scott</i> that these circumstances favor dismissal without prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 58.</p>\n<p><i>Stayton,</i> on the other hand, is not only non-binding but also inapplicable here because of its vastly different facts. In <i>Stayton,</i> there was no indication that the defendant bore any responsibility for the delay, for which the reviewing court could not discern \"a single justifying reason.\" <i>Stayton,</i> 791 F.2d at 20. Here, Franklin's responsibility was twofold: he requested a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> continuance and later remained silent about the delay until he filed the motion to dismiss. <i>See </i><i>Dessesaure,</i> 556 F.3d at 86 (reversing dismissal with prejudice where \"the defendant was as well-placed to remind the judge [about the delay] as was the prosecutor\"). Additionally, in <i>Stayton</i> the delay was 23 months; here, the delaywhether 180 days, as the district court found, or 234, as Franklin argues was far shorter. In the end, then, <i>Scott</i> controls, <i>Stayton</i> is wholly inapposite, and the facts and circumstances of the delay strongly favor the government.</p>\n<p>Third, Franklin suggests that dismissal without prejudice would disrupt the administration of justice and of the Speedy Trial Act by effectively extracting the Act's teeth. This argument ignores the Act's specific inclusion of dismissal without prejudice as a sanction, and that sanction's several teeth: the cost to the government in bringing a new prosecution, the possibility of statute of limitations issues, the chance of failure to re-indict, and the risk of losing evidence and witnesses over time; the argument has therefore been roundly repudiated by both this court and the Supreme Court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112129\"><a href=\"/opinion/112129/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>, 342, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112129\"><a href=\"/opinion/112129/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We need say no more on that.</p>\n<p>Fourth and finally, Franklin does not suggest how he might have been prejudiced by the delay, instead espousing the proposition that where \"serious enough\" delay occurs, \"it [i]s unnecessary to determine the extent to which the defendant ha[s] actually been prejudiced.\" But the delay here was not extreme, and it resulted at least in part from Franklin's own request for a continuance and subsequent inaction. More importantly, Franklin's suggestion that we bypass prejudice belies a glaring weakness in his argument: there is nothing in either the record or the briefs to indicate that he actually was prejudiced in any way by the district court's delay. Accordingly, the fourth factor tips the scale still further in the government's favor.</p>\n<p>Thus, the record reveals a serious crime, a somewhat lengthy but innocuous delay, a just sanction, and no harm to Franklin. Far from being an abuse of discretion, the district court's dismissal without prejudice was utterly appropriate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure ... against unreasonable searches.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. This right is given effect through the exclusionary rule, which \"forbids the use of improperly obtained evidence at trial.\" <i>Herring v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145922\"><a href=\"/opinion/145922/herring-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145922\"><a href=\"/opinion/145922/herring-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span> (2009). Here, Franklin asserts that the drugs found in the trunk of the Taurus sedan were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and, therefore, that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress this evidence. Specifically, Franklin argues that he did not consent to the officers' search, and that the officers had neither a warrant nor probable cause to otherwise justify their actions. We review de novo the legal questions underlying these arguments, accepting as true the court's factual assessments unless clearly erroneous. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marshall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200712\"><a href=\"/opinion/200712/united-states-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 284 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Consent</i></h2>\n<p>There is no dispute that a \"specifically established exception[]\" to the Fourth Amendment's \"requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search that is conducted pursuant to consent.\" <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span> (1973)) (internal quotation marks removed). For consent to be valid, it must be given knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. <i>See </i><i>Marshall,</i> 348 F.3d at 286. This brief recitation of the law is all that is necessary here because the law is not in dispute: Franklin has elected to focus his attack on the factual determinations underlying the district court's decision.</p>\n<p>First, Franklin says that \"[t]he issue of whether [he] voluntarily consented to the search of the trunk of his car depended upon resolving a conflict between the testimony of two DEA task force agents, George MacLaughlin and Michael Cashman, on the one hand,\" and his own testimony, on the other. Franklin suggests that the officers' testimony is so implausible that no reasonable fact-finder could possibly have subscribed to it rather than his own. For example, Franklin asserts that \"[h]owever cooperative he appeared to be, the last thing he would have done was to tell the police where they could find the drugs that he was supposedly trying to hide from them.\" And yet according to Franklin's own testimony, he told the officers that he had gone to the car \"to smoke some weed.\" That weed must have come from somewhere: either he brought it with him to the car, or it was already in the car. In either case, it ended up in the car. Given Franklin's testimony, then, it hardly seems improbable that Franklin might have admitted to the officers that there were drugs in the car. Moreover, courts have routinely rejected the notion that testimony is implausible merely because it recounts a defendant's acting against his own self-interest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Mendenhall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110264\"><a href=\"/opinion/110264/united-states-v-mendenhall/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 559, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110264\"><a href=\"/opinion/110264/united-states-v-mendenhall/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1870</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110264\"><a href=\"/opinion/110264/united-states-v-mendenhall/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span> (1980). Overall, Franklin's attempts to draw inconsistencies and implausibilities from the officers' testimony are barely colorable; they come nowhere near the clear error threshold.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Franklin's other primary argument on this pointthat the officers' testimony is suspect because it is not corroborated by a consent formlikewise holds no water. A consent form certainly would have made the prosecution's task easier, but it was not necessary, and its absence does not undercut the officers' consistent testimony. Indeed, our case law is clear that \"[w]ritten consent is not essential to the establishment of a valid consensual search.\" <i>United States v. Barnett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603504\"><a href=\"/opinion/603504/united-states-v-michael-barnett-united-states-of-america-v-barry-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 555 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>A consent form was particularly unnecessary here given other evidence sufficient to establish consent: specifically, uncontested testimony that Franklin told the officers to \"do what you got to do.\" The district court concluded that this unenthusiastic statement evinced consent, and given circuit precedent upholding consent under similar circumstances, this conclusion was not clear error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zapata,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195255\"><a href=\"/opinion/195255/united-states-v-zapata/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span>, 974, 977 (1st Cir. 1994) (consent clear from statement: \"Sure, go ahead\"); <i>Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d at 556 (consent clear from statement: \"Go ahead; you'd probably get a search warrant anyway\"). Franklin's statement, particularly viewed in light of his prior statements about the car and his choice to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> surrender ammunition to the officers, could reasonably be construed as consent.</p>\n<p>Finally, Franklin asserts that this case is factually similar to <i>United States v. Escobar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788406\"><a href=\"/opinion/788406/united-states-v-jose-martinez-escobar-vicky-lynn-loos-also-known-as-vicky/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2004), in which a panel of the Eighth Circuit held that the defendants' consent to a search of their luggage was not voluntary because they had simply \"acquiesced to the search believing [they] had no choice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 786. However, <i>Escobar</i> neither binds us nor offers us any persuasive value given the utterly distinct facts of this case. In <i>Escobar,</i> the police knew nothing about the defendants, who were random bus passengers subject to a general sweep, or their criminal history, <i>see id.</i> at 782-83; here, officers knew Franklinincluding his criminal history and his consequent familiarity with criminal procedurequite well, having spent about a year building a drug case against him.<sup>[6]</sup> In <i>Escobar,</i> officers lied to the defendants and claimed that drug-detection dogs had already alerted to their luggage, <i>see id.</i> at 783, 786; here, the police did not lie to Franklineven Franklin's own account demonstrates a candid conversation in which he freely admitted to having marijuana in the car that was searched. And, most importantly, in <i>Escobar,</i> the officers did not advise the passengers of any of their rights, <i>see id.</i> at 783, 786; here, Franklin was immediately advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rightsincluding the right to remain silentand he indicated he understood those rights. Thus, the circumstances that the court found were relevant to the <i>Escobar</i> defendants' \"believing [they] had no choice\"lack of demonstrated familiarity with criminal procedure, lies designed to elicit consent, and no notice of a right to remain silentwere entirely absent here.<sup>[7]</sup> Franklin's reliance on <i>Escobar</i> is misplaced, and it was not clear error for the district court to find Franklin's consent voluntary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Probable Cause</i></h2>\n<p>Even if the district court's consent finding were questionableand the above discussion should make clear that it is notthe automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement would vindicate the officers' search because the agents had probable cause to believe that the Taurus contained drugs. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201204\"><a href=\"/opinion/201204/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 543 (1st Cir.2004) (\"A warrantless search of an automobile will be upheld if `officers have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Ross,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110719\"><a href=\"/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span>, 808, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110719\"><a href=\"/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2157</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110719\"><a href=\"/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span> (1982)). To put it briefly: the agents testified Franklin told them there was marijuana in the car; the district court credited the agents' version of events in finding probable cause; and we have already held that the district court's factual findings are far from clearly erroneous. Thus, the probable cause question is quickly dispatched.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The district court adequately addressed an admitted Speedy Trial Act violation by dismissing Franklin's charges without prejudice. Franklin's conviction was properly based in part on a vehicle search that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> was legal in every respect. Accordingly, we <i>affirm.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Authorities involved in the investigation included the Boston Housing Police, the Boston Police (specifically the Youth Violence Task Force, or gang unit), the Massachusetts State Police, the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>\n<p>[2]  The record includes both McLaughlin and MacLaughlin as spellings of the detective's name; we choose the more frequently occurring MacLaughlin.</p>\n<p>[3]  The hearing, originally scheduled for November 3, 2005, was postponed for about two and a half weeks after Franklin was granted a continuance.</p>\n<p>[4]  As Franklin does, we consider the length of delay under the facts-and-circumstances prong rather than setting it out as a separate factor.</p>\n<p>[5]  Such is the case with Franklin's arguments that the officers' testimony is implausible because (1) his comment about the car being in his mother's name was a non-sequitur, and (2) experienced officers would never bother asking consent to search a car after a suspect has already admitted there are drugs in the car. Contrary to Franklin's contentions, it is quite plausible that the former was a halfhearted attempt at evasion and the latter was simply belt-and-suspenders police work.</p>\n<p>[6]  Actually, the officers' familiarity stretched far past the investigation giving rise to this case; at the time of Franklin's arrest, for example, Detective Fratalia had maintained a cordial if adversarial working relationship with him \"since the late 1980s.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  We reject the notion that the district court clearly erred when it found that the officers had not threatened to tow Franklin's car and obtain a search warrant. However, even assuming such an error, the facts and circumstances spelled out above would still overwhelmingly favor a finding of consent.</p>\n\n</div>",
