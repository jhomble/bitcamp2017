Appellant Glenn  Allen was\n                                   \n\nconvicted of conspiracy to  possess in excess of 10 grams of LSD,\n\npossession  of  psilocybin   with  intent   to  distribute,   and\n\ndistribution  of  psilocybin,  in   violation  of  21  U.S.C.    \n\n841(a)(1) and  846, and 18  U.S.C.    2.  Appellant  alleges that\n\ninsufficient evidence existed to support his convictions and that\n\nthe government violated  his Fourth Amendment  rights.  Based  on\n\nthese  allegations, appellant requests  a new trial.   Because we\n\nfind that sufficient  evidence supported appellant's convictions,\n\nand that  no Fourth Amendment violations occurred,  we affirm the\n\nverdict.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Evidence of the  following appeared at trial.  A United\n\nStates  postal inspector, assigned  to investigate transportation\n\nof  illicit drugs  through  the mail,  became  suspicious of  two\n\nExpress Mail package  receipts.  The  receipts were addressed  to\n\nKurt Humphrey  in Maine and  sent from two locations  on the west\n\ncoast of  the United States.   The sender's name  on each receipt\n\ncoincided with  a previously  investigated sender.   In addition,\n\nthe  originating  addresses were  false.    The postal  inspector\n\ndirected the appropriate postmaster in Maine to watch  for future\n\nExpress Mail packages  addressed to Kurt  Humphrey from the  west\n\ncoast.\n\n          Such a  package arrived from Oregon on January 11, 1990\n\nat 7:00 a.m.   The  postmaster alerted the  postal inspector  one\n\nhour  later  when the  inspector  arrived  at  the New  Hampshire\n\n                               -2-\n\noffice,  where he  was working  that day.   The  postal inspector\n\ndirected  the  postmaster to  hold  the  package pending  further\n\ninstruction.  Ordinarily,  the postmaster would have  immediately\n\nnotified  Humphrey that the package had arrived.  The package had\n\na guaranteed delivery time of 3:00 p.m. that day.\n\n          At 10:00 a.m. in  New Hampshire, 7:00 a.m. on  the West\n\nCoast,  the inspector  called the  appropriate Oregon  office and\n\nlearned that the  originating address and the sender's  name were\n\nfictitious.   The inspector  then arranged  with the  Maine state\n\npolice for a trained dog to sniff the package for drugs.  The dog\n\nwas trained  to find marijuana,  cocaine, hashish, and  heroin in\n\nall of their forms.\n\n          When the  state police  arrived at  the post office  at\n\nnoon, the postmaster closed the  office for lunch.  He then  took\n\nthe  police officers to his  nearby house to  conduct the test in\n\nprivacy.   Four times, the police  hid the package in  the garage\n\nand sent the  dog to  find it.   Each time, the  dog located  the\n\npackage and indicated the presence of drugs.\n\n          The police presented an affidavit to a local magistrate\n\ndescribing  the test and stating  that the package  had been sent\n\nfrom a  fictitious  address.    The magistrate  issued  a  search\n\nwarrant  at  4:21  p.m.   When  the  police  officers opened  the\n\npackage,  they found  11,200  rations of  LSD  on 112  sheets  of\n\nblotter paper.  The police then prepared a dummy package with two\n\nsheets of blotter  paper in an  apparently unopened Express  Mail\n\nenvelope.   Meanwhile, sometime between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.,\n\n                               -3-\n\nHumphrey  checked his  post office box,  found nothing,  and left\n\nwithout inquiring about the package.\n\n          The next day, Humphrey returned to the post  office and\n\nreceived  the dummy package.  When Humphrey left the post office,\n\ntwo  police officers followed  him.  They  ultimately stopped him\n\nen-route to appellant's house.\n\n          At trial, Humphrey described  appellant's participation\n\nin the scheme,  alleging that appellant recruited him  to receive\n\npackages  and  deliver  them to  appellant  for  a  fee of  fifty\n\ndollars.  Humphrey also stated that appellant sold him $250 worth\n\nof  psilocybin  mushrooms.   The  police  later found  psilocybin\n\nmushrooms  in Humphrey's home and in a barn on appellant's family\n\nproperty.\n\n          In  addition, the police  found a money  order for $400\n\nfrom James  Paoletti made out  to appellant in  appellant's home.\n\nPaoletti testified  that the money order  represented payment for\n\nLSD.\n\n          Appellant moved to suppress the contents of the Express\n\nmail package  unsuccessfully.  He also lost  motions for judgment\n\nof acquittal.\n\n                        APPELLANT'S CLAIMS\n                                          \n\n          I.  Sufficiency of the evidence\n\n          \"The standard  of review for sufficiency  challenges is\n\nwhether the total evidence,  taken in the light most  amicable to\n\nthe   prosecution,  together   with  all   reasonable  inferences\n\nfavorable to it,  would allow a rational fact-finder  to conclude\n\n                               -4-\n\nbeyond  a reasonable  doubt  that  the  defendant was  guilty  as\n\ncharged.\"  United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 522-23 (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1991).   Viewing  the record  in this  light, we  find sufficient\n\nevidence for appellant's conviction on all three counts.\n\n          First,  through testimony  from Paoletti  and Humphrey,\n\nthe government presented sufficient  evidence for a rational jury\n\nto conclude that appellant  conspired to possess LSD  with intent\n\nto  distribute it.  The following evidence was admitted at trial.\n\nPaoletti  sent appellant  a  $400 money  order  to buy  LSD  that\n\nappellant would obtain from the West Coast.  (Transcript of Trial\n\nProceedings at 145).  After procuring an Express Mail shipment of\n\nLSD from the West Coast, appellant would pay Humphrey to retrieve\n\nthe  package from the post  office and deliver  it to appellant's\n\nhome.   Id. at 20.  Pursuant to a search warrant, police officers\n          \n\nsearched the  package, discovered  LSD, and  replaced  it with  a\n\ndummy package.  Humphrey retrieved the  package, and the officers\n\narrested him on the way to appellant's home.  Id. at 20-21.  From\n                                                \n\nthis evidence,  a rational  jury could  find appellant  guilty of\n\nconspiracy to possess LSD beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          Second,   sufficient  evidence   supported  appellant's\n\nconviction for distribution of psilocybin.  To prove this charge,\n\nit  was enough to show that the  defendant had the \"power and the\n\nintention to cause the transfer . . . either directly or  through\n\nanother person . . . .\"  United States v. Acevedo, 842 F.2d  502,\n                                                 \n\n507  (1st Cir. 1988).  Humphrey testified that (1) when appellant\n\nwas  in Europe in November 1989, he phoned Humphrey, and Humphrey\n\n                               -5-\n\nasked him if he  could get some psilocybin, (Transcript  of Trial\n\nProceedings at 34); (2) appellant offered him the psilocybin that\n\nwas  in the barn  at appellant's home,  id. at  35; (3) appellant\n                                          \n\nagreed  to sell  a quarter  pound of  psilocybin for  $250, which\n\nHumphrey would pay when appellant returned from  Europe, id.; (4)\n                                                           \n\nHumphrey took the psilocybin from the barn, id. at 35-36; and (5)\n                                              \n\nwhen appellant returned,  Humphrey offered him  a gun as  partial\n\npayment, which  appellant took, saying he'd  try it to see  if he\n\nwanted  it, id. at 39.   The government  also introduced evidence\n              \n\nthat the police confiscated psilocybin from Humphrey, id. at  37,\n                                                        \n\nand from the  barn on appellant's property,  id. at 90-91.   From\n                                               \n\nthis evidence, a rational jury could conclude that  appellant had\n\nthe power and intent to cause the transfer of psilocybin.\n\n          Finally,   sufficient   evidence  existed   to  support\n\nappellant's conviction  for possession with intent  to distribute\n\npsilocybin.   In order to  prove this crime,  the government must\n\nestablish  that the  defendant  had, possession  of a  controlled\n\nsubstance, knowledge of that  possession, and the specific intent\n\nto  distribute  it.    21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1).     Constructive\n\npossession will  support a conviction  and can be  established by\n\ncircumstantial  evidence  such  as  a  defendant's  ownership  or\n\ncontrol  over the  premises in  which the  contraband  is hidden.\n\nAcevedo, 842  F.2d  at 507.    Appellant argues  that  he had  no\n       \n\nownership or control over  the psilocybin because his family  had\n\naccess to the barn where it was stored,  and because he exercised\n\nno exclusive or mutual control over the part of the barn in which\n\n                               -6-\n\nthe  mushrooms were  found.   Humphrey  testified, however,  that\n\nappellant  ordered  the  psilocybin  and  hid  it  in  the  barn,\n\n(Transcript of Trial  Proceedings at  28), and that  on the  same\n\nday, appellant showed him  psilocybin mushrooms that he had  in a\n\nduffel bag,  id. at 28.  From this evidence, the jury could infer\n               \n\nthat appellant owned or controlled the psilocybin in the barn.\n\n          Appellant attacks the  credibility of the  government's\n\nwitnesses  for  all three  charges.   He  complains that  part of\n\nPaoletti's testimony  conflicted with a prior  made statement and\n\nthat Humphrey  offered solely  conclusory assertions.   These are\n\nsuitable  arguments  for  the   jury,  and  appellant  had  ample\n\nopportunity  to present  them at  trial.   As  the jury  chose to\n\nreject them, we must do the same.  United States  v. Angiulo, 897\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1169,  1197  (1st Cir.)  (reviewing court  must resolve  all\n\ncredibility determinations  in favor  of verdict),  cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n498 U.S. 845 (1990).\n\n          II.  Fourth Amendment Issues\n\n          Appellant next argues that  the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to suppress the  LSD found in the Express Mail\n\npackage.  Specifically, appellant contends that the detention and\n\nsubsequent search  of the  package violated his  Fourth Amendment\n\nright  against unreasonable  search and  seizure because  (1) the\n\ndetention  was  not  based  on  a  reasonable suspicion  that  it\n\ncontained contraband; and (2)  it was unreasonable.1  See  United\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n1   In his brief, appellant also  argued that the police officers\nlacked probable cause to search the package because the dogs were\nnot  trained to  sniff  LSD.    At  oral  argument,  however,  he\n\n                               -7-\n\nStates v.  La  France, 879  F.2d  1, 4  (1st  Cir. 1989)  (police\n                     \n\nentitled to delay delivery if delay is based reasonable suspicion\n\nand is reasonably executed).  We find, however, that a reasonable\n\nview of the  record evidence supports the district court's denial\n\nof the motion.  See United States v. Masse, 816 F.2d 805, 809 n.4\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (citing United States v. Veillette, 778 F.2d 899,\n                                                  \n\n902  (1st  Cir. 1985)  (appellate  court  should uphold  district\n\ncourt's  denial  of motion  to  suppress  if  reasonable view  of\n\nevidence supports it).\n\n          The  court properly  found  that  reasonable  suspicion\n\nsupported the  package's delayed  delivery.  The  record evidence\n\nshows that  the postal inspector  has seven  years of  experience\n\ninvestigating drug  transportation  through  the  mail,  and  has\n\ninvestigated between  200 and 300 cases  involving drug transport\n\nthrough  Express Mail.    (Transcript of  Hearing on  Defendant's\n\nMotion to Suppress Evidence at 12-13).  He grew suspicious of the\n\npackage for several reasons.   Individuals rarely receive Express\n\nMail packages, and Humphrey  received three in five months.   Id.\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\nabandoned that argument and conceded that the disputed time frame\nconsisted  of that  between the  arrival of  the package  and the\nsniff test.\n\n   We note that  the test  did in fact  generate probable  cause.\nProbable  cause  is judged  upon  the  information known  to  the\nauthorities and presented at the time the warrant issues.  United\n                                                                 \nStates  v.   Johnston,  784  F.2d  416,  420   (1st  Cir.  1986).\n                     \nInformation  available to  the magistrate  at this  time revealed\nthat a  trained dog had alerted  to the presence of  drugs in the\npackage four times.  This information gave rise to probable cause\nto  suspect that  the  package contained  contraband.   That  the\npackage  later turned out to  contain LSD, which  the dog was not\ntrained to find, is irrelevant.\n\n                               -8-\n\nat  55.   Also,  the inspector  knew  that Humphrey  had received\n\nsuspicious mailings  from the West Coast in the past.  Id. at 15.\n                                                         \n\nThe labels were suspicious because the return addresses differed,\n\nbut  the handwriting, in his observation, appeared the same.  Id.\n                                                                \n\nAlso,  one of  the  senders  had the  same  name  as someone  who\n\npreviously  mailed an Express Mail package containing psilocybin.\n\nId.   From  this  evidence, the  district  court found  that  the\n  \n\ninspector  had   reasonable  suspicion  to  detain   the  package\n\ninitially.  When the inspector  learned that the sender's address\n\nwas  fictitious, additional  suspicion developed,  justifying the\n\nfurther delay that it took to arrange for the dog sniff test.\n\n          In  addition   to  having  reasonable   suspicion,  the\n\nofficials did not unreasonably delay delivery of the package.  To\n\ndetermine  the  reasonableness  of   the  delay,  we  review  the\n\ndiligence of  the investigators, the length of detention, and the\n\ninformation conveyed  to the suspect.   La France, 879 F.2d  at 7\n                                                 \n\n(citing United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 709-10 (1983)).\n                              \n\n          In  the present case,  the law  enforcement authorities\n\nacted  diligently.  The delay  lasted only as  long as necessary.\n\nThe postmaster promptly contacted  the postal inspector to obtain\n\nfurther  information, and  the  postal  inspector  then  promptly\n\nverified the  addresses, waiting only for  the appropriate office\n\nto open.  Id. at  26-27.  When the inspector determined  that the\n            \n\naddresses did not  exist, he  arranged for and  executed the  dog\n\ntest.  (Transcript of  Hearing on Defendant's Motion  to Suppress\n\nEvidence   at  26-29).    No  evidence  suggested  that  the  law\n\n                               -9-\n\nenforcement officials could have acted more swiftly.\n\n          Furthermore, the dog was located at a distance from the\n\npostmaster's home, id. at 91-92; yet, within five hours after the\n                     \n\npostmaster notified  the inspector  about the package,  the sniff\n\ntest was complete.  Indeed,  sufficient probable cause to  search\n\nthe package  developed two  hours before the  guaranteed delivery\n\ntime,  and thus  before  appellant had  a significant  possessory\n\ninterest.

Appellant Glenn  Allen was\n                                   \n\nconvicted of conspiracy to  possess in excess of 10 grams of LSD,\n\npossession  of  psilocybin   with  intent   to  distribute,   and\n\ndistribution  of  psilocybin,  in   violation  of  21  U.S.C.    \n\n841(a)(1) and  846, and 18  U.S.C.    2.  Appellant  alleges that\n\ninsufficient evidence existed to support his convictions and that\n\nthe government violated  his Fourth Amendment  rights.  Based  on\n\nthese  allegations, appellant requests  a new trial.   Because we\n\nfind that sufficient  evidence supported appellant's convictions,\n\nand that  no Fourth Amendment violations occurred,  we affirm the\n\nverdict.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Evidence of the  following appeared at trial.  A United\n\nStates  postal inspector, assigned  to investigate transportation\n\nof  illicit drugs  through  the mail,  became  suspicious of  two\n\nExpress Mail package  receipts.  The  receipts were addressed  to\n\nKurt Humphrey  in Maine and  sent from two locations  on the west\n\ncoast of  the United States.   The sender's name  on each receipt\n\ncoincided with  a previously  investigated sender.   In addition,\n\nthe  originating  addresses were  false.    The postal  inspector\n\ndirected the appropriate postmaster in Maine to watch  for future\n\nExpress Mail packages  addressed to Kurt  Humphrey from the  west\n\ncoast.\n\n          Such a  package arrived from Oregon on January 11, 1990\n\nat 7:00 a.m.   The  postmaster alerted the  postal inspector  one\n\nhour  later  when the  inspector  arrived  at  the New  Hampshire\n\n                               -2-\n\noffice,  where he  was working  that day.   The  postal inspector\n\ndirected  the  postmaster to  hold  the  package pending  further\n\ninstruction.  Ordinarily,  the postmaster would have  immediately\n\nnotified  Humphrey that the package had arrived.  The package had\n\na guaranteed delivery time of 3:00 p.m. that day.\n\n          At 10:00 a.m. in  New Hampshire, 7:00 a.m. on  the West\n\nCoast,  the inspector  called the  appropriate Oregon  office and\n\nlearned that the  originating address and the sender's  name were\n\nfictitious.   The inspector  then arranged  with the  Maine state\n\npolice for a trained dog to sniff the package for drugs.  The dog\n\nwas trained  to find marijuana,  cocaine, hashish, and  heroin in\n\nall of their forms.\n\n          When the  state police  arrived at  the post office  at\n\nnoon, the postmaster closed the  office for lunch.  He then  took\n\nthe  police officers to his  nearby house to  conduct the test in\n\nprivacy.   Four times, the police  hid the package in  the garage\n\nand sent the  dog to  find it.   Each time, the  dog located  the\n\npackage and indicated the presence of drugs.\n\n          The police presented an affidavit to a local magistrate\n\ndescribing  the test and stating  that the package  had been sent\n\nfrom a  fictitious  address.    The magistrate  issued  a  search\n\nwarrant  at  4:21  p.m.   When  the  police  officers opened  the\n\npackage,  they found  11,200  rations of  LSD  on 112  sheets  of\n\nblotter paper.  The police then prepared a dummy package with two\n\nsheets of blotter  paper in an  apparently unopened Express  Mail\n\nenvelope.   Meanwhile, sometime between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.,\n\n                               -3-\n\nHumphrey  checked his  post office box,  found nothing,  and left\n\nwithout inquiring about the package.\n\n          The next day, Humphrey returned to the post  office and\n\nreceived  the dummy package.  When Humphrey left the post office,\n\ntwo  police officers followed  him.  They  ultimately stopped him\n\nen-route to appellant's house.\n\n          At trial, Humphrey described  appellant's participation\n\nin the scheme,  alleging that appellant recruited him  to receive\n\npackages  and  deliver  them to  appellant  for  a  fee of  fifty\n\ndollars.  Humphrey also stated that appellant sold him $250 worth\n\nof  psilocybin  mushrooms.   The  police  later found  psilocybin\n\nmushrooms  in Humphrey's home and in a barn on appellant's family\n\nproperty.\n\n          In  addition, the police  found a money  order for $400\n\nfrom James  Paoletti made out  to appellant in  appellant's home.\n\nPaoletti testified  that the money order  represented payment for\n\nLSD.\n\n          Appellant moved to suppress the contents of the Express\n\nmail package  unsuccessfully.  He also lost  motions for judgment\n\nof acquittal.\n\n                        APPELLANT'S CLAIMS\n                                          \n\n          I.  Sufficiency of the evidence\n\n          \"The standard  of review for sufficiency  challenges is\n\nwhether the total evidence,  taken in the light most  amicable to\n\nthe   prosecution,  together   with  all   reasonable  inferences\n\nfavorable to it,  would allow a rational fact-finder  to conclude\n\n                               -4-\n\nbeyond  a reasonable  doubt  that  the  defendant was  guilty  as\n\ncharged.\"  United States v.

Viewing  the record  in this  light, we  find sufficient\n\nevidence for appellant's conviction on all three counts.\n\n          First,  through testimony  from Paoletti  and Humphrey,\n\nthe government presented sufficient  evidence for a rational jury\n\nto conclude that appellant  conspired to possess LSD  with intent\n\nto  distribute it.  The following evidence was admitted at trial.\n\nPaoletti  sent appellant  a  $400 money  order  to buy  LSD  that\n\nappellant would obtain from the West Coast.  (Transcript of Trial\n\nProceedings at 145).  After procuring an Express Mail shipment of\n\nLSD from the West Coast, appellant would pay Humphrey to retrieve\n\nthe  package from the post  office and deliver  it to appellant's\n\nhome.   Id. at 20.  Pursuant to a search warrant, police officers\n          \n\nsearched the  package, discovered  LSD, and  replaced  it with  a\n\ndummy package.  Humphrey retrieved the  package, and the officers\n\narrested him on the way to appellant's home.  Id. at 20-21.  From\n                                                \n\nthis evidence,  a rational  jury could  find appellant  guilty of\n\nconspiracy to possess LSD beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          Second,   sufficient  evidence   supported  appellant's\n\nconviction for distribution of psilocybin.  To prove this charge,\n\nit  was enough to show that the  defendant had the \"power and the\n\nintention to cause the transfer . . . either directly or  through\n\nanother person . . . .\"  United States v.

Humphrey testified that (1) when appellant\n\nwas  in Europe in November 1989, he phoned Humphrey, and Humphrey\n\n                               -5-\n\nasked him if he  could get some psilocybin, (Transcript  of Trial\n\nProceedings at 34); (2) appellant offered him the psilocybin that\n\nwas  in the barn  at appellant's home,  id. at  35; (3) appellant\n                                          \n\nagreed  to sell  a quarter  pound of  psilocybin for  $250, which\n\nHumphrey would pay when appellant returned from  Europe, id.; (4)\n                                                           \n\nHumphrey took the psilocybin from the barn, id. at 35-36; and (5)\n                                              \n\nwhen appellant returned,  Humphrey offered him  a gun as  partial\n\npayment, which  appellant took, saying he'd  try it to see  if he\n\nwanted  it, id. at 39.   The government  also introduced evidence\n              \n\nthat the police confiscated psilocybin from Humphrey, id. at  37,\n                                                        \n\nand from the  barn on appellant's property,  id. at 90-91.   From\n                                               \n\nthis evidence, a rational jury could conclude that  appellant had\n\nthe power and intent to cause the transfer of psilocybin.\n\n          Finally,   sufficient   evidence  existed   to  support\n\nappellant's conviction  for possession with intent  to distribute\n\npsilocybin.   In order to  prove this crime,  the government must\n\nestablish  that the  defendant  had, possession  of a  controlled\n\nsubstance, knowledge of that  possession, and the specific intent\n\nto  distribute  it.    21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1).     Constructive\n\npossession will  support a conviction  and can be  established by\n\ncircumstantial  evidence  such  as  a  defendant's  ownership  or\n\ncontrol  over the  premises in  which the  contraband  is hidden.\n\nAcevedo, 842  F.2d  at 507.    Appellant argues  that  he had  no\n       \n\nownership or control over  the psilocybin because his family  had\n\naccess to the barn where it was stored,  and because he exercised\n\nno exclusive or mutual control over the part of the barn in which\n\n                               -6-\n\nthe  mushrooms were  found.   Humphrey  testified, however,  that\n\nappellant  ordered  the  psilocybin  and  hid  it  in  the  barn,\n\n(Transcript of Trial  Proceedings at  28), and that  on the  same\n\nday, appellant showed him  psilocybin mushrooms that he had  in a\n\nduffel bag,  id. at 28.  From this evidence, the jury could infer\n               \n\nthat appellant owned or controlled the psilocybin in the barn.\n\n          Appellant attacks the  credibility of the  government's\n\nwitnesses  for  all three  charges.   He  complains that  part of\n\nPaoletti's testimony  conflicted with a prior  made statement and\n\nthat Humphrey  offered solely  conclusory assertions.   These are\n\nsuitable  arguments  for  the   jury,  and  appellant  had  ample\n\nopportunity  to present  them at  trial.   As  the jury  chose to\n\nreject them, we must do the same.

Fourth Amendment Issues\n\n          Appellant next argues that  the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to suppress the  LSD found in the Express Mail\n\npackage.  Specifically, appellant contends that the detention and\n\nsubsequent search  of the  package violated his  Fourth Amendment\n\nright  against unreasonable  search and  seizure because  (1) the\n\ndetention  was  not  based  on  a  reasonable suspicion  that  it\n\ncontained contraband; and (2)  it was unreasonable.1  See  United\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n1   In his brief, appellant also  argued that the police officers\nlacked probable cause to search the package because the dogs were\nnot  trained to  sniff  LSD.

The  record evidence\n\nshows that  the postal inspector  has seven  years of  experience\n\ninvestigating drug  transportation  through  the  mail,  and  has\n\ninvestigated between  200 and 300 cases  involving drug transport\n\nthrough  Express Mail.    (Transcript of  Hearing on  Defendant's\n\nMotion to Suppress Evidence at 12-13).  He grew suspicious of the\n\npackage for several reasons.

This information gave rise to probable cause\nto  suspect that  the  package contained  contraband.   That  the\npackage  later turned out to  contain LSD, which  the dog was not\ntrained to find, is irrelevant.\n\n                               -8-\n\nat  55.   Also,  the inspector  knew  that Humphrey  had received\n\nsuspicious mailings  from the West Coast in the past.  Id. at 15.\n                                                         \n\nThe labels were suspicious because the return addresses differed,\n\nbut  the handwriting, in his observation, appeared the same.

From  this  evidence, the  district  court found  that  the\n  \n\ninspector  had   reasonable  suspicion  to  detain   the  package\n\ninitially.  When the inspector  learned that the sender's address\n\nwas  fictitious, additional  suspicion developed,  justifying the\n\nfurther delay that it took to arrange for the dog sniff test.\n\n          In  addition   to  having  reasonable   suspicion,  the\n\nofficials did not unreasonably delay delivery of the package.  To\n\ndetermine  the  reasonableness  of   the  delay,  we  review  the\n\ndiligence of  the investigators, the length of detention, and the\n\ninformation conveyed  to the suspect.   La France, 879 F.2d  at 7\n                                                 \n\n(citing United States v. Place, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110979\"><a href=\"/opinion/110979/united-states-v-place/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 709-10 (1983)).\n                              \n\n          In  the present case,  the law  enforcement authorities\n\nacted  diligently.  The delay  lasted only as  long as necessary.\n\nThe postmaster promptly contacted  the postal inspector to obtain\n\nfurther  information, and  the  postal  inspector  then  promptly\n\nverified the  addresses, waiting only for  the appropriate office\n\nto open.  Id. at  26-27.  When the inspector determined  that the\n            \n\naddresses did not  exist, he  arranged for and  executed the  dog\n\ntest.  (Transcript of  Hearing on Defendant's Motion  to Suppress\n\nEvidence   at  26-29).    No  evidence  suggested  that  the  law\n\n                               -9-\n\nenforcement officials could have acted more swiftly.\n\n          Furthermore, the dog was located at a distance from the\n\npostmaster's home, id. at 91-92; yet, within five hours after the\n                     \n\npostmaster notified  the inspector  about the package,  the sniff\n\ntest was complete.  Indeed,  sufficient probable cause to  search\n\nthe package  developed two  hours before the  guaranteed delivery\n\ntime,  and thus  before  appellant had  a significant  possessory\n\ninterest.   See  La  France, 879  F.2d  at 7  (before  guaranteed\n                           \n\ndelivery  time,   only  possessory  interest   is  contract-based\n\nexpectancy  that  package  would  be  delivered  on  time).   The\n\ndistrict court judge properly found the delay reasonable.\n\n          Finally, appellant received no misinformation regarding\n\nhis package.    Indeed,  he never  inquired  about  the  package.\n\nAccordingly,  we  find  that  the record  evidence  supports  the\n\ndistrict court's denial of the motion to suppress.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n                                      \n\n          Because   sufficient  evidence   supported  appellant's\n\nconviction, and  appellant's  Fourth Amendment  rights  were  not\n\nviolated, we affirm appellant's conviction.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -10-\n</pre>",
