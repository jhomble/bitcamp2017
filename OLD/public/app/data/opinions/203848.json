This appeal requires us to answer\n\nthe question whether a pier in East Providence, Rhode Island, is--\n\nas to the parties in this dispute--to be considered real property\n\n(\"realty\") and so subject to the law of easements or, because of an\n\nagreement by the parties' predecessors-in-interest, is personal\n\nproperty (\"personalty\").    Based on a prior decision of the Rhode\n\nIsland Supreme Court, we affirm the federal district court's\n\ndecision that the pier is personalty.\n\n     The history of the background transactions and relevant prior\n\nlitigation is remarkably complex, but can be severely truncated.\n\nLike the district court, we think that the classification of the\n\nproperty was settled earlier by statements of the Rhode Island\n\ncourts in cases involving the same property and the same parties or\n\ntheir predecessors-in-interest.         The chance that these precise\n\ncircumstances will recur is, happily, close to zero.\n\n     Plaintiff-appellant    Dunellen,     LLC,    is   the    owner    of    the\n\nWilkesbarre   Pier   projecting   into    the    Seekonk     River    in    East\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island.   The pier was built during the 1870's by\n\nthe Wilkesbarre Coal and Iron Company and was later acquired by the\n\nProvidence and Worcester Railroad Company (\"P&W\").           Initially, the\n\npier was used to offload coal from barges; today the pier is a\n\nfacility for offloading petroleum products from ships using two oil\n\npipelines running along the pier.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f       As a result of numerous corporate transactions, agreements and\n\nlaw suits over the past century, ownership of the land underlying\n\nthe pier at one point became separated from ownership of the pier;\n\nbut ownership of the pier and land underneath now belong solely to\n\nDunellen subject to rights of others to use the pier.    One of those\n\nothers is defendant-appellee Getty Properties, which retains a\n\nright to use the north side of the pier under a reservation of\n\nrights contained in a 1941 deed.\n\n       Through state court litigation in the 1970s, Dunellen's own\n\npredecessor P&W recovered ownership of the pier based on rights\n\ncontained in the same 1941 deed.       Providence & Worcester Co. v.\n\nExxon Corp., 359 A.2d 329 (R.I. 1976).    In that decision, the state\n\nsupreme court held that following the \"consensus of the parties to\n\nthe 1941 deed,\" the pier was personalty and that P&W's exercise of\n\nits reserved rights gave it a \"fee simple to personalty, that is,\n\na conveyance of the totality of interests in the existing pier save\n\nfor defendants' right to use the north side of said pier.\"    Id. at\n\n341.\n\n       Getty had use of the pier under agreements with a predecessor\n\nof Dunellen with Getty paying part of taxes and repairs; but in\n\n2000 a dispute arose about repairs and Getty sued Dunellen's\n\npredecessor.    A jury awarded Getty damages for breach of contract\n\nand, separately, the judge reaffirmed Getty's right to use the\n\nnorth side of the pier--calling the right an \"easement\"-- despite\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe claim that this right had been abandoned or that Getty was\n\nestopped to assert it.           But the court declined to decide what\n\nobligations Getty might have to contribute to costs independent of\n\nan agreement.\n\n       After the law suit, Getty and Dunellen were unable to reach\n\na new agreement as to sharing of costs, and Getty has not used the\n\npier    since   early    2003.      Dunellen   thereafter    made   capital\n\nimprovements and repairs and unsuccessfully sought payment from\n\nGetty of half the costs.         Dunellen then brought the present suit\n\nagainst Getty in federal district court, seeking both past costs\n\nfrom Getty and a declaration that Getty would also be liable for a\n\nshare of future costs as long as it claimed a right to use the\n\nnorth side of the pier.\n\n       On summary judgment, Getty prevailed.       Dunellen LLC v. Getty\n\nProps. Corp., 557 F. Supp. 2d 263 (D.R.I. 2008).                The court\n\nrejected Dunellen's judicial estoppel argument.             Id. at 269-70.\n\nThe court also ruled that the 1976 Rhode Island Supreme Court\n\ndecision--that the pier was personalty--was binding on it.           Id. at\n\n270-71.   Since Getty is not using the pier and was not at the time\n\nDunellen made improvements, the court said it had no obligation to\n\npay.    Id. at 272.     Dunellen now appeals.\n\n       We agree with the district court that the Rhode Island Supreme\n\nCourt said that the pier should be regarded as personalty and that\n\ncharacterization should be respected.           The characterization may\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fsurprise anyone raised on the common law rule that a fixture\n\nbecomes part of the real estate, a fixed pier being a classic\n\nfixture. Prospecting Unlimited, Inc. v. Norberg, 376 A.2d 702, 705\n\n(R.I. 1977); Butler v. Butler's Diner, Inc., 98 A.2d 875, 876 (R.I.\n\n1953). But courts sometimes allow parties to agree that annexation\n\nof personal property to real estate will not change its legal\n\ncharacter,1 which seemingly occurred incident to the 1941 deed.\n\n     However     this    may       be,   we    will    not    decide     afresh   the\n\nclassification of a particular piece of property under state law\n\nwhere, as here, the state's highest court has decided the very\n\nissue in litigation that involved predecessor companies.                    Dunellen\n\nargues   that,   as     it   now    owns      both    the   land   and   pier,    this\n\nunification should supplant the state court ruling; but for such a\n\nclaim Dunellen would have been better off suing in state court.\n\nPorter v. Nutter, 913 F.2d 37, 40-41 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n     Dunellen also invoked judicial estoppel.                 Indeed, courts have\n\nrecognized that where \"a person has previously dealt with an\n\narticle as personal property, he may be estopped to subsequently\n\ntreat it as realty where the inconsistent position will result in\n\nprejudice to one who has acted in justifiable reliance upon the\n\n\n     1\n      E.g., Hughes v. Young, 444 S.E.2d 248, 250 (N.C. App. 1994);\nBlehm v. Ringering, 488 P.2d 798, 800-01 (Or. 1971) (\"[p]arties may\nagree that an annexed article shall be regarded as personalty\"); 2\nTiffany, The Law of Real Property, § 612 (3d ed. 1939 & Supp. 2008-\n09) (\"The owner of a chattel and the owner of land may agree that\nthe annexation of the chattel to the land shall not change the\nlegal character of the chattel . . . .\").\n\n                                         -5-\n\fapparent status of the article as personalty.\"               Chermside Jr.,\n\nEstoppel to Assert that Article Annexed to Realty is or is not A\n\nFixture, 60 A.L.R. 2d 1209 § 5[a] (1958) (citing cases).\n\n       But here it was Dunellen's predecessor that argued in prior\n\nlitigation that the pier was personalty and used that decision to\n\nregain control of the pier. Providence and Worcester Co., 359 A.2d\n\nat 341.     Judicial estoppel, a somewhat malleable doctrine using\n\nequitable principles, is mainly concerned with letting a party who\n\nprevailed earlier on a position in court from reversing course in\n\nlater litigation.     That description applies more to Dunellen than\n\nto Getty and the district court did not err in refusing to apply\n\nestoppel.\n\n       In its 2002 law suit, where it prevailed, Getty did describe\n\nits right to use the pier as being \"in the nature\" of an easement;\n\nbut the qualifier suggests that the term was used as a reasonable\n\nanalogy; in fact, Getty also specifically referred to the 1976\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court decision characterizing the pier as\n\n\"personalty.\"     The   trial   court     in   that   case   used   the   term\n\n\"easement\" without the qualifier but, however read, the epithet\n\ncannot overcome the state supreme court's characterization.\n\n       For similar reasons we reject Dunellen's argument that Getty\n\nis collaterally estopped from asserting that its right to use the\n\npier    constitutes   personalty.       Collateral     estoppel     precludes\n\nrelitigation of a settled matter where, inter alia, \"the point was\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\factually litigated in the earlier proceeding.\"               Acevedo-Garcia v.\n\nMonroig, 351 F.3d 547, 575-76 (1st Cir. 2003).                      In the 2002\n\nlitigation, the point that was actually litigated was whether Getty\n\nhad abandoned its right to use the pier.\n\n       Both parties agreed (and thus did not dispute) that the law of\n\neasements provided a framework to determine that question.                    The\n\nCourt did not decide, nor did Getty concede, that the pier was no\n\nlonger   personalty,      so    collateral     estoppel   cannot    bar   Getty's\n\npresent argument.       Finally, Dunellen did not raise its collateral\n\nestoppel argument in the district court so, in addition, the claim\n\nis waived.     Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n       The   real    property   label,    carrying    with   it    remnants   of\n\nmedieval land law, would assist Dunellen although perhaps less than\n\nit thinks.     In general, one who holds an easement in real property\n\nis required to make expenditures to keep the property in repair\n\nand,   often    in    proportion    to    use,   to   contribute     to   upkeep.\n\nRestatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes § 4.13(1) (2000).                 It\n\nis less clear that major improvements could be charged to a non-\n\nusing, non-consenting easement holder.\n\n       In any event, lacking the real property label, Dunellen had to\n\ngive us reason to think that Getty was liable to contribute to\n\nupkeep and improvements with respect to an interest in personalty\n\nthat it was not using and Dunellen has pointed to nothing in Rhode\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fIsland law that creates such an obligation. If Getty exercises its\n\nrights and the parties cannot agree on payment, Dunellen might\n\nconsider whether a state court would be the best forum to resolve\n\nthat dispute.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Providence and Worcester Co., 359 A.2d\n\nat 341.     Judicial estoppel, a somewhat malleable doctrine using\n\nequitable principles, is mainly concerned with letting a party who\n\nprevailed earlier on a position in court from reversing course in\n\nlater litigation.     That description applies more to Dunellen than\n\nto Getty and the district court did not err in refusing to apply\n\nestoppel.\n\n       In its 2002 law suit, where it prevailed, Getty did describe\n\nits right to use the pier as being \"in the nature\" of an easement;\n\nbut the qualifier suggests that the term was used as a reasonable\n\nanalogy; in fact, Getty also specifically referred to the 1976\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court decision characterizing the pier as\n\n\"personalty.\"     The   trial   court     in   that   case   used   the   term\n\n\"easement\" without the qualifier but, however read, the epithet\n\ncannot overcome the state supreme court's characterization.\n\n       For similar reasons we reject Dunellen's argument that Getty\n\nis collaterally estopped from asserting that its right to use the\n\npier    constitutes   personalty.       Collateral     estoppel     precludes\n\nrelitigation of a settled matter where, inter alia, \"the point was\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\factually litigated in the earlier proceeding.\"               Acevedo-Garcia v.\n\nMonroig, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575-76 (1st Cir. 2003).                      In the 2002\n\nlitigation, the point that was actually litigated was whether Getty\n\nhad abandoned its right to use the pier.\n\n       Both parties agreed (and thus did not dispute) that the law of\n\neasements provided a framework to determine that question.                    The\n\nCourt did not decide, nor did Getty concede, that the pier was no\n\nlonger   personalty,      so    collateral     estoppel   cannot    bar   Getty's\n\npresent argument.       Finally, Dunellen did not raise its collateral\n\nestoppel argument in the district court so, in addition, the claim\n\nis waived.     Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195171\"><a href=\"/opinion/195171/daigle-v-maine-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n       The   real    property   label,    carrying    with   it    remnants   of\n\nmedieval land law, would assist Dunellen although perhaps less than\n\nit thinks.     In general, one who holds an easement in real property\n\nis required to make expenditures to keep the property in repair\n\nand,   often    in    proportion    to    use,   to   contribute     to   upkeep.\n\nRestatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes § 4.13(1) (2000).                 It\n\nis less clear that major improvements could be charged to a non-\n\nusing, non-consenting easement holder.\n\n       In any event, lacking the real property label, Dunellen had to\n\ngive us reason to think that Getty was liable to contribute to\n\nupkeep and improvements with respect to an interest in personalty\n\nthat it was not using and Dunellen has pointed to nothing in Rhode\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fIsland law that creates such an obligation. If Getty exercises its\n\nrights and the parties cannot agree on payment, Dunellen might\n\nconsider whether a state court would be the best forum to resolve\n\nthat dispute.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f</pre>",
