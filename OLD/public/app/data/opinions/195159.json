Defendant Rub n Mart nez pleaded guilty to\n          Per Curiam\n                    \n\ntwo counts of conspiring to distribute cocaine in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C.   846 and three  counts of distributing or possessing with\n\nthe  intent  to  distribute  cocaine in  violation  of  21 U.S.C.\n\n   841(a)(1) &amp; 18  U.S.C.   2(a).  On January 7, 1993, the United\n\nStates District Court for the District  of Rhode Island sentenced\n\nMart nez to  five concurrent terms  of 51 months in  prison, five\n\nyears  of  supervised  release,  including  a  special  condition\n\nrelating  to deportation, and the required assessments.  Mart nez\n\nchallenges  his sentence  because  it  was based  in  part on  an\n\nallegedly erroneous  finding that he  was a  leader or  organizer\n\nunder  United States  Sentencing  Guidelines     3B1.1(c).1    We\n\naffirm.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          According to  the Pre-Sentence  Report (\"PSR\") and  the\n\ntranscript of the sentencing hearing, see United States v. Reyes,\n                                                                \n\n3 F.3d  29, 29-30  (1st Cir. 1993)  (stating that  upon a  guilty\n\nplea, the relevant  facts should  be taken from  the PSR and  the\n\nsentencing transcript); United States v. Castellone, 985 F.2d 21,\n                                                   \n\n22  (1st  Cir.  1993)  (same),  Drug  Enforcement  Administration\n\n(\"DEA\") Special  Agent  Russell  Holske  purchased  cocaine  from\n\ndefendant  Mart nez  on  three   separate  occasions  during   an\n\nundercover investigation in April  through July of 1992.   Holske\n\nmade his  first purchase on April  1, 1992, buying 27.7  grams of\n\n                    \n\n1   All  citations refer  to the  1992 version of  the Sentencing\nGuidelines which were in effect at the time of the sentencing.\n\n                               -2-\n\ncocaine from  Mart nez for  $900.  On  that occasion,  Holske met\n\nwith Mart nez who  then made a phone call because he did not have\n\nthe  drugs  with  him.    Shortly  thereafter,  codefendant  Juan\n\nIturibides  arrived with the  cocaine and  handed it  to Mart nez\n\nwho, in turn, handed it to Holske.\n\n          Two  days later, Holske purchased 50.5 grams of cocaine\n\nfrom Mart nez for  $1750.  As in the  first transaction, Mart nez\n\nmade a  phone call before  the drugs were delivered;  however, on\n\nthe second  occasion, codefendant El as Ventura  Morales, instead\n\nof  codefendant  Ituribides,  actually  brought  the  cocaine  to\n\nMart nez.\n\n          On July 17, 1992, Agent Holske negotiated with Mart nez\n\nfor the  purchase of \"Two Big  Eights\" (9 ounces) of  cocaine for\n\n$8000.   After  Holske  and  Mart nez met,  they  were joined  by\n\nMorales.  The three then moved  to a new location where  Mart nez\n\nshowed Holske a small sample of cocaine in exchange for a look at\n\nthe money Holske brought.   Morales left and then returned twenty\n\nto  thirty minutes  later  at  which  point DEA  agents  arrested\n\nMart nez and Morales and seized 223.4 grams of cocaine.\n\n          Mart nez  contests this version  of events.   He claims\n\nthat he was not the source or supplier of the cocaine but instead\n\nmerely  an intermediary who  was offered money  by a confidential\n\ninformant to assist in the sale.  During the first sale, Mart nez\n\ncontends, Ituribides supplied the cocaine and collected the money\n\nfor the deal while Mart nez  only assisted by passing the cocaine\n\nto Holske.   For the other two purchases, Mart nez claims that he\n\n                               -3-\n\nwas approached  by the confidential  informant and asked  for the\n\nwhereabouts  of   Ituribides.    On  those   occasions,  Mart nez\n\ncontends, Morales intervened  in the discussion and  arranged the\n\ndrug deals.   According  to Mart nez, his  only role was  to wait\n\nwith the informant while Morales went to get the cocaine.\n\n         II.  ENHANCEMENT OF SENTENCE FOR LEADERSHIP ROLE\n\n          In calculating  Mart nez' sentence, the  district court\n\nimposed a two level enhancement  for being a leader and organizer\n\npursuant to  U.S.S.G.    3B1.1(c).2   Mart nez  claims the  court\n\nerred because the presentence  report contains insufficient facts\n\nnecessary to support  a finding that Mart nez  organized, managed\n\nor directed the  activities of his codefendants in committing the\n\ncharged offenses.\n\n          We  review the district  court's \"role in  the offense\"\n\ndetermination for clear  error.   United States  v. Schultz,  970\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 960, 963-64 (1st  Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S.  Ct. 1020\n                                               \n\n(1993); United  States v. Veilleux,  949 F.2d 522, 524  (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1991).   A leadership  role  enhancement is  warranted where  the\n\ndefendant has  exercised control  or directed  the actions  of at\n\nleast one other  person in committing the crime.   The sentencing\n\ncourt  can take  into account  such  factors as  the exercise  of\n\ndecision  making authority  and the  degree  of participation  in\n\n                    \n\n2  U.S.S.G.    3B1.1(c) provides for an  increase in the  offense\nlevel:\n\n            If  the   defendant  was   an  organizer,\n            leader,  manager,  or supervisor  in  any\n            criminal activity other than described in\n            (a) or (b), . . . \n\n                               -4-\n\nplanning or  organizing the  offense.   U.S.S.G.    3B1.1 comment\n\nnote 3; Schultz, 970 F.2d at 964; United States v. Panet-Collazo,\n                                                                \n\n960 F.2d 256, 261  (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113  S. Ct. 220\n                                                \n\n(1992).\n\n          The evidence  from the PSR is sufficient to support the\n\nsentencing  judge's determination that Mart nez \"was a leader and\n\norganizer of this little business  [to sell cocaine] that he had\"\n\nand  that  Mart nez \"had  working  for  him Ventura  Morales  and\n\nInterpediz [sic].\"   According to the  PSR, Holske purchased  the\n\ncocaine  \"from\" Mart nez or \"negotiated with\" Mart nez during all\n\nthree of  the drug transactions.   During  the July  transaction,\n\nMart nez \"arranged  to be  met\" at a  certain location  and later\n\ndisplayed  a sample  of cocaine  for Holske.   On  two occasions,\n\nMart nez first met  with Holske and then placed  a telephone call\n\nafter which the cocaine was delivered.  When considered together,\n\nthis  evidence  is sufficient  for  the  judge  to conclude  that\n\nMart nez   arranged  and  planned  each  sale  and  directed  the\n\nactivities  of his  codefendants  who  served  as  assistants  or\n\ncouriers for Mart nez' operation.\n\n          Mart nez insists  that the evidence  in the PSR  is, at\n\nmost,  only  sufficient to  support  a  finding  that he  was  an\n\nintermediary.  There is nothing, Mart nez claims, to show he gave\n\nany  orders  or  directions  to  anyone  or  otherwise  exercised\n\ndecision making authority.   He further asserts that  there is no\n\nevidence,  beyond  the  bald  statement  that  Holske  \"purchased\n\ncocaine\" or \"negotiated\" with Mart nez, to support the conclusion\n\n                               -5-\n\nthat Mart nez set terms and conditions, made the arrangements, or\n\nprofited from the sale.\n\n          While  the  actions  reported in  the  PSR  (making the\n\ninitial  contact with the  buyer and  placing phone  calls before\n\neach  drug  delivery)  may   be  consistent  with  those  of   an\n\nintermediary,  they  are also  consistent with  those taken  by a\n\nleader or organizer.  When  we factor in Holske's statements that\n\nMart nez  \"negotiated\"   the  deal  and  \"arranged\"  the  meeting\n\nlocation, we  find ample support for the  court's inferences that\n\nMart nez was making decisions about  terms and conditions when he\n\nmet with  Holske, and  exercising control  over his  codefendants\n\nwhen he made the telephone calls.  \"'Where    there    are    two\n\npermissible  views  of  the  evidence,  the  factfinder's  choice\n\nbetween them cannot be  clearly erroneous.'\"  Veilleux, 949  F.2d\n                                                      \n\nat 525 (quoting  Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564,\n                                                  \n\n574  (1985)).  The sentencing judge, in fact, explicitly rejected\n\nMart nez'  alternative  version  of events  when  he  stated that\n\nMart nez had not been \"completely  candid with the Court nor with\n\nthe Probation  Counsellor trying to  give the impression  that he\n\nwas really working for somebody else, but he wasn't.\"\n\n          Mart nez also claims  that the sentencing  judge failed\n\nto  make  reasonably  specific factual  findings  to  support the\n\nupward adjustment.  This objection is groundless.  The sentencing\n\ncourt's explicit  rejection of  Mart nez' alternative  version of\n\nevents,  together with its statements that, based on the evidence\n\nin the  PSR, Mart nez was  a leader of  his own business  to sell\n\n                               -6-\n\ncocaine,3  constitutes specific  factual  findings which  support\n\nthe upward adjustment.  See Schultz,  970 F.2d at 963 n.7; United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Wells Metal Finishing, Inc., 922 F.2d 54, 58  (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1991).   As we discuss  below, any objections to  the evidentiary\n\nbasis for the court's specific factual findings are waived.\n     \n\n              III.  OTHER OBJECTIONS TO THE SENTENCE\n\n          Mart nez  claims  that the  sentencing  judge erred  by\n\nrelying upon information outside his own PSR to determine whether\n\nhe was a leader and organizer.  During sentencing, the judge did,\n\nin fact,  explicitly base  his findings  partly upon  information\n\ncontained in  the PSR's  of Mart nez'  codefendants, Morales  and\n\nIturibides.   Mart nez'  counsel, however,  failed  to voice  any\n\n                    \n\n3  At the sentencing hearing, the sentencing judge stated:\n\n            I'm satisfied  from the evidence  in this\n            matter  presented from  all the  material\n            that I've  been  privy to  not only  from\n            this  presentence  report  but  from  the\n            presentence report involving  Morales and\n            Interpediz  that  this  Defendant  was  a\n            leader, an organizer.   He was akin  to a\n            self-employed,      independent     sales\n            representative.   I'm  satisfied that  he\n            didn't own  the  cocaine, but  he was  in\n            business for himself  selling cocaine and\n            he  was going  to  earn a  commission for\n            selling that  cocaine and he  had working\n            for him  Ventura Morales  and Interpediz.\n            As a matter of fact,  Interpediz was only\n            involved in one  instance for a pittance,\n            about $40  was going  to be  his pay  for\n            simply going  to the  source and  getting\n            the  cocaine  and   bringing  it  to  the\n            designated place and  Morales was serving\n            in the same  function.  So  the Defendant\n            clearly  was a  leader  and organizer  of\n            this little business that he had.  So the\n            Probation Office  was correct  in tacking\n            on two points in this case.\n\n                               -7-\n\nobjections to this  at the hearing.  Consequently,  the issue has\n\nnot been  preserved for appeal  unless there are  some \"unusually\n\ncompelling circumstances.\"   United States v.  Ocasio-Rivera, 991\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).  This exception mainly applies where a\n\ncorrection  of the  alleged error  would  ensure the  defendant's\n\nsuccess and thus prevent a miscarriage of justice.  Id.  Mart nez\n                                                      \n\nfails  to point out  any circumstances, compelling  or otherwise,\n\nthat  would be  sufficient to  overcome  his procedural  default.\n\nGiven the  sufficiency of the  evidence in Mart nez' own  PSR and\n\ngiven  that  the  judge,  in  making  a  \"role  in  the  offense\"\n\ndetermination  for Mart nez, had  to take into  consideration the\n\nrelative roles of  all the codefendants anyway,4 we are convinced\n\nthat no miscarriage of justice has occurred in this case.\n\n          Mart nez   also  challenges   the  sentencing   judge's\n\ndecision to  grant only  a two level,  instead of a  three level,\n\ndecrease   in  his   base  offense   level   for  acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility  pursuant to U.S.S.G.   3E1.1(b)(2).  He concedes,\n\nhowever, that  he did not raise this  objection during sentencing\n\nand  that \"under the  'plain error' rule, he  will not succeed on\n\nthis point alone.\"   As we have decided all  other issues against\n\nthe defendant,  according to  his own  admission, we must  decide\n\n                    \n\n4   According to the prosecution, prior  to Mart nez' sentencing,\nthe  district court  had  already determined  that  at least  one\ncodefendant, Ituribides,  was merely  a courier  and had  awarded\nIturibides  a downward  adjustment  for  playing  a  minor  role.\nDefense  counsel  also  referred  to  this  at  the  hearing  and\ncautioned the judge that such  a finding did not necessarily mean\nthat  Mart nez was  a leader  and organizer.   The issue  of what\nroles were played  by Mart nez' codefendants was  thus brought to\nthe judge's attention before his ruling.\n\n                               -8-\n\nthis one against him as well.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -9-\n",

As in the first transaction, Martnez made a phone call before the drugs were delivered;  however, on the second occasion, codefendant Elas Ventura Morales, instead of codefendant Ituribides, actually brought the cocaine to Martnez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 1992, Agent Holske negotiated with Martnez for the purchase of \"Two Big Eights\" (9 ounces) of cocaine for $8000.  After Holske and Martnez met, they were joined by Morales.  The three then moved to a new location where Martnez showed Holske a small sample of cocaine in exchange for a look at the money Holske brought.

During the first sale, Martnez contends, Ituribides supplied the cocaine and collected the money for the deal while Martnez only assisted by passing the cocaine to Holske.  For the other two purchases, Martnez claims that he was approached by the confidential informant and asked for the whereabouts of Ituribides.  On those occasions, Martnez contends, Morales intervened in the discussion and arranged the drug deals.  According to Martnez, his only role was to wait with the informant while Morales went to get the cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>II.

Sec. 3B1.1(c).<sup>2</sup>  Martnez claims the court erred because the presentence report contains insufficient facts necessary to support a finding that Martnez organized, managed or directed the activities of his codefendants in committing the charged offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's \"role in the offense\" determination for clear error.   United States v. Schultz, 970 F.2d 960, 963-64 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1020 (1993);   United States v. Veilleux, 949 F.2d 522, 524 (1st Cir. 1991).  A leadership role enhancement is warranted where the defendant has exercised control or directed the actions of at least one other person in committing the crime.  The sentencing court can take into account such factors as the exercise of decision making authority and the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1 comment note 3;  Schultz, 970 F.2d at 964;   United States v. Panet-Collazo, 960 F.2d 256, 261 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 220 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence from the PSR is sufficient to support the sentencing judge's determination that Martnez \"was a leader and organizer of this little business [to sell cocaine] that he had\" and that Martnez \"had working for him Ventura Morales and Interpediz [sic].\"  According to the PSR, Holske purchased the cocaine \"from\" Martnez or \"negotiated with\" Martnez during all three of the drug transactions.  During the July transaction, Martnez \"arranged to be met\" at a certain location and later displayed a sample of cocaine for Holske.  On two occasions, Martnez first met with Holske and then placed a telephone call after which the cocaine was delivered.  When considered together, this evidence is sufficient for the judge to conclude that Martnez arranged and planned each sale and directed the activities of his codefendants who served as assistants or couriers for Martnez' operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martnez insists that the evidence in the PSR is, at most, only sufficient to support a finding that he was an intermediary.  There is nothing, Martnez claims, to show he gave any orders or directions to anyone or otherwise exercised decision making authority.  He further asserts that there is no evidence, beyond the bald statement that Holske \"purchased cocaine\" or \"negotiated\" with Martnez, to support the conclusion that Martnez set terms and conditions, made the arrangements, or profited from the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the actions reported in the PSR (making the initial contact with the buyer and placing phone calls before each drug delivery) may be consistent with those of an intermediary, they are also consistent with those taken by a leader or organizer.  When we factor in Holske's statements that Martnez \"negotiated\" the deal and \"arranged\" the meeting location, we find ample support for the court's inferences that Martnez was making decisions about terms and conditions when he met with Holske, and exercising control over his codefendants when he made the telephone calls.  \" 'Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.' \"   Veilleux, 949 F.2d at 525 (quoting  Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985)).  The sentencing judge, in fact, explicitly rejected Martnez' alternative version of events when he stated that Martnez had not been \"completely candid with the Court nor with the Probation Counsellor trying to give the impression that he was really working for somebody else, but he wasn't.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martnez also claims that the sentencing judge failed to make reasonably specific factual findings to support the upward adjustment.  This objection is groundless.  The sentencing court's explicit rejection of Martnez' alternative version of events, together with its statements that, based on the evidence in the PSR, Martnez was a leader of his own business to sell cocaine,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> constitutes specific factual findings which support the upward adjustment.   See Schultz, 970 F.2d at 963 n. 7;   United States v. Wells Metal Finishing, Inc., 922 F.2d 54, 58 (1st Cir. 1991).  As we discuss below, any objections to the evidentiary basis for the court's specific factual findings are waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. OTHER OBJECTIONS TO THE SENTENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martnez claims that the sentencing judge erred by relying upon information outside his own PSR to determine whether he was a leader and organizer.  During sentencing, the judge did, in fact, explicitly base his findings partly upon information contained in the PSR's of Martnez' codefendants, Morales and Ituribides.  Martnez' counsel, however, failed to voice any objections to this at the hearing.  Consequently, the issue has not been preserved for appeal unless there are some \"unusually compelling circumstances.\"   United States v. Ocasio-Rivera, 991 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).  This exception mainly applies where a correction of the alleged error would ensure the defendant's success and thus prevent a miscarriage of justice.  Id. Martnez fails to point out any circumstances, compelling or otherwise, that would be sufficient to overcome his procedural default.  Given the sufficiency of the evidence in Martnez' own PSR and given that the judge, in making a \"role in the offense\" determination for Martnez, had to take into consideration the relative roles of all the codefendants anyway,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we are convinced that no miscarriage of justice has occurred in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martnez also challenges the sentencing judge's decision to grant only a two level, instead of a three level, decrease in his base offense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(b)(2).  He concedes, however, that he did not raise this objection during sentencing and that \"under the 'plain error' rule, he will not succeed on this point alone.\"  As we have decided all other issues against the defendant, according to his own admission, we must decide this one against him as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> All citations refer to the 1992 version of the Sentencing Guidelines which were in effect at the time of the sentencing</p>\n        <p>2 U.S.S.G.

He was akin to a self-employed, independent sales representative.  I'm satisfied that he didn't own the cocaine, but he was in business for himself selling cocaine and he was going to earn a commission for selling that cocaine and he had working for him Ventura Morales and Interpediz.  As a matter of fact, Interpediz was only involved in one instance for a pittance, about $40 was going to be his pay for simply going to the source and getting the cocaine and bringing it to the designated place and Morales was serving in the same function.  So the Defendant clearly was a leader and organizer of this little business that he had.  So the Probation Office was correct in tacking on two points in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> According to the prosecution, prior to Martnez' sentencing, the district court had already determined that at least one codefendant, Ituribides, was merely a courier and had awarded Ituribides a downward adjustment for playing a minor role.  Defense counsel also referred to this at the hearing and cautioned the judge that such a finding did not necessarily mean that Martnez was a leader and organizer.  The issue of what roles were played by Martnez' codefendants was thus brought to the judge's attention before his ruling</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

So the Defendant clearly was a leader and organizer of this little business that he had.  So the Probation Office was correct in tacking on two points in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> According to the prosecution, prior to Martnez' sentencing, the district court had already determined that at least one codefendant, Ituribides, was merely a courier and had awarded Ituribides a downward adjustment for playing a minor role.  Defense counsel also referred to this at the hearing and cautioned the judge that such a finding did not necessarily mean that Martnez was a leader and organizer.  The issue of what roles were played by Martnez' codefendants was thus brought to the judge's attention before his ruling</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
