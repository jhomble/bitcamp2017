Kenneth P. Neiman,          U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                          Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n         Souter, Associate Justice,* and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Bryan K. Clauson for appellants.\n     Edward M. Pikula, City Solicitor, City of Springfield Law\nDepartment, with whom John T. Liebel, Chief of Litigation, was on\nbrief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                                 July 22, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           SOUTER,    Associate    Justice.      The   named      plaintiffs-\n\nappellants    are   mothers   of   teenagers   who   were   not   physically\n\nrestrained by school officials of the defendant-appellee city from\n\nleaving their schools during instructional hours.           The defendant-\n\nappellee Martha Dodge1 had the job of directing the school system\n\nin complying with relevant law.       The mothers brought action under\n\nstate law (not before us) as well as 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1988\n\nseeking monetary and injunctive relief for violating Fourteenth\n\nAmendment due process: the mothers’ right to preserve family\n\nintegrity and the children’s right to enjoy freedom from abuse and\n\nneglect.     The defendants responded to the legal issues raised by\n\nmoving to dismiss on the ground that the complaint stated no\n\nfederal claim on which relief could be granted, see Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6), and explained their policy of permissiveness by referring\n\nto a State education regulation limiting use of lawful physical\n\nrestraint to instances in which children’s unfettered behavior\n\nwould raise a risk of “assault or imminent, serious, physical harm”\n\nto themselves or others, see 603 Code Mass. Regs. § 46.04 (2);\n\nabsent such danger, the prevention of truancy would not be worth\n\nthe burden of defending the liability claims that would doubtless\n\neventuate.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The surname is actually Von Merring; the case caption was\nnever corrected.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            As constitutional claims, those stated here do not rise\n\nto a substantial level, and the magistrate judge granted the\n\nmotions to dismiss.         But he also recognized the frustration the\n\nmothers quite naturally experienced when the schools’ refusal to\n\nconfine children to school premises during school hours effectively\n\nconverted the State’s compulsory attendance law into the children’s\n\noption to wander off into trouble that the parents could not\n\neffectively prevent.         He therefore went on to suggest that the\n\nmothers    consider   the    possibility     of   relief    from    the   general\n\nregulation through Individual Educational Plans for their children\n\nas special education students. In the meantime, appellant Ruiz has\n\ndropped her claim for injunctive relief because her son is beyond\n\nthe age of compulsory education.\n\n            In any event, the appeals are without merit for reasons\n\nwell explained in the magistrate judge’s carefully prepared order.\n\nThe   mothers’   claims      that   inadequate     supervision      in    schools\n\ninfringes their rights to maintain the integrity of their families\n\nare said to rest principally on Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390\n\n(1923), and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925),\n\ncases that held it to be beyond the power of states to limit a\n\nparent’s    choice    to    provide    foreign    language    instruction     in\n\nelementary schools or to resort to private education.                 But these\n\ncases   recognized    a     parent’s   liberty    to   be    free   from    state\n\ninterference with certain education choices, not a right to require\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fstate or local government to run public schools in a way a parent\n\nmight think they ought to be administered.        Hence the rule in this\n\ncircuit, that any actionable interference with family integrity\n\nmust   be   “directly   aimed   at   the    parent-child   relationship.”\n\nManarite v. Springfield, 957 F.2d 953, 960 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            As for the claimed violation of the children’s right to\n\nbe free from abuse and neglect, the Supreme Court’s discussion in\n\nDeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, 489\n\nU.S. 189, 199-200 (1989), is on point: “[W]hen the State takes a\n\nperson into its custody and holds him there against his will, the\n\nConstitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some\n\nresponsibility for his safety and general well-being” (citing\n\nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 317 (1982)).          The situation of\n\nthe children in this case is not even close to facts that would\n\nthus raise a state obligation.       There is neither restraint of the\n\nchild (that indeed is the very complaint), nor any practice or\n\ncircumstance rendering the child unable to care for himself, nor\n\nfailure to provide basic human needs of food, clothing, shelter,\n\nmedical care or reasonable safety.         As the Court later observed in\n\nVernonia School District 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 655 (1995),\n\n“we do not, of course, suggest that public schools as a general\n\nmatter have such a degree of control over children as to give rise\n\nto a constitutional ‘duty to protect’” (citing DeShaney, 489 U.S.\n\nat 200).    Whatever the scope of a school’s responsibility towards\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fits students, then, there is no apparent constitutional obligation\n\nto impose physical restraint upon teenagers not at immediate risk\n\nof harm to themselves or others.\n\n          Because the complaint was correctly dismissed, there is\n\nno reason to consider the subsidiary issues of qualified immunity\n\nand standards for injunctive relief.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
