Pursuant  to  a plea  agreement,\n          CYR,  Circuit Judge.\n                             \n\nappellant Stephen Williams pled guilty to fourteen counts of mail\n\nfraud,  whereupon other charges  were dismissed and  Williams was\n\nsentenced to  seven months'  imprisonment.   On appeal,  Williams\n\nchallenges,  among other things,  the district court's  denial of\n\nhis request for an evidentiary hearing and its determination that\n\ncertain criminal acts alleged in the dismissed counts constituted\n\n\"relevant conduct\"  under the counts  of conviction.   Finding no\n\nerror, we affirm.  \n\n                                I\n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          In 1980,  Williams and codefendant Bruce  Kotek founded\n\nS.E.R.V.E.S.S.,  Inc. (SERVESS),  a Massachusetts  not-for-profit\n                                                                 \n\ncorporation  which operated homes  for the handicapped.   SERVESS\n\nentered  into at-cost contracts  with the Commonwealth  of Massa-\n                     \n\nchusetts (Commonwealth) for the placement of mentally handicapped\n\npersons in SERVESS group homes.  These contracts entitled SERVESS\n\nto reimbursement for its expenses but  prohibited it from realiz-\n\ning  a profit.   In 1984, while  serving on the  SERVESS board of\n\ndirectors,  Williams and  Kotek  established Community  Services,\n\nInc.  (CSI), a for-profit  corporation which would  contract with\n                         \n\ncompanies like SERVESS to operate their group homes in return for\n\na  management fee.   In July 1984,  Williams and  Kotek, in their\n\ncapacity as SERVESS directors:  (1) voted to enter into a manage-\n\nment contract with CSI; (2) promoted a  SERVESS employee, William\n\nPolis,  to serve  as SERVESS's  new executive  director; and  (3)\n\nresigned from  the SERVESS Board  effective August 31, 1984.   On\n\nSeptember 1, 1984, the  day after the Williams and Kotek resigna-\n\ntions became effective,  the SERVESS-CSI management contract  was\n\nexecuted by Polis on behalf of SERVESS.   In 1985, during Polis's\n\ntenure, at the  instance of  Williams and  Kotek SERVESS  entered\n\ninto  several long-term leases  of property owned  by real estate\n\ntrusts  controlled by  the third  codefendant,  Robert Alexander.\n\nAlthough only  Alexander received  income from  these properties,\n\nKotek,  Williams and  Alexander were  all residual  beneficiaries\n\nunder the real estate trusts.\n\n          In January  1986,  Williams and  Kotek founded  another\n\nnot-for-profit corporation called D.A.R.S.O., Inc. (DARSO), which\n              \n\noperated day-care centers for mentally handicapped persons.  Like\n\nSERVESS,  DARSO  contracted  directly with  the  Commonwealth for\n\nreimbursement of its at-cost expenses, and leased several parcels\n\nof real property from  the same real  estate trusts.  DARSO  also\n\npurchased furniture  from a  company  in which  Williams held  an\n\ninterest.   Williams  served  as  a director  of  DARSO from  its\n\ninception.\n\n          Massachusetts  law  requires  that  any  not-for-profit\n\ncorporation  submitting  expense  reimbursement requests  to  the\n\nCommonwealth disclose  whether the  expense was  incurred with  a\n\n\"related person,\" defined as \"[a] person or organization which is\n\nassociated or affiliated with or  has control of or is controlled\n                                                \n\nby the  [not-for-profit corporation] or  is related to  the [not-\n\n                                3\n\nfor-profit  corporation] or  any director,  stockholder, trustee,\n\npartner or  administrator of the [not-for-profit  corporation] by\n\ncommon ownership or  control or in a manner  specified in [I.R.C.\n\n  267(b), (c).]\"  See 114.5 Mass. Reg. 3.02 (emphasis added).\n                     \n\n          In  November 1990, Williams,  Kotek, Alexander, and the\n\nvarious  corporate entities were indicted for RICO violations, 18\n\nU.S.C.    1962(c),  RICO  conspiracy, 18  U.S.C.     1962(d), and\n\nmultiple counts  of mail fraud,  18 U.S.C.   1341,  in connection\n\nwith the alleged SERVESS and DARSO schemes to defraud the Common-\n\nwealth.    The indictment  was  based  on Williams's  failure  to\n\ndisclose:   (1)  that  he and  Kotek, through  executive director\n\nPolis,  \"controlled\" SERVESS at the  time CSI and SERVESS entered\n                   \n\ninto  their management contract;  and (2) that  both corporations\n\nleased  property from real estate trusts whose beneficiaries were\n\n\"related parties.\"  The  government charged that the  SERVESS and\n\nDARSO  reimbursement  requests  exceeded their  costs,  and  that\n\nWilliams  and Kotek  defrauded the  Commonwealth  by using  these\n\n\"hidden profits\"  to improve,  and  acquire equity  in, the  real\n\nestate leased to SERVESS and DARSO by the real estate trusts.\n\n          At sentencing,  the government  characterized the  dis-\n\nmissed  SERVESS  counts  as  \"relevant  conduct\"  under  U.S.S.G.\n\n  1B1.3 and introduced a transcript  of the grand jury  testimony\n\nof  William Polis,  to the effect  that he was  acting under Wil-\n\nliams's  \"control\"  when  he signed  the  SERVESS-CSI  management\n\n                                4\n\ncontract in  September 1984.1   Williams argued that  the SERVESS\n\nscheme was too remote in time and context to constitute \"relevant\n\nconduct\" under  the DARSO  counts, and  requested an  evidentiary\n\nhearing  for the purpose  of cross-examining  Polis on  his grand\n\njury testimony concerning the  issue of \"control.\"  The  district\n\ncourt denied the request for an evidentiary hearing and found the\n\nloss occasioned by  the SERVESS counts to be  \"relevant conduct.\"\n\nWilliams appeals the resulting seven-month prison sentence.2\n\n                    \n\n     1The  gross loss  occasioned the  Commonwealth  by the  mail\nfraud directly  related to  the SERVESS  counts was  estimated at\nbetween $500,000 and $1 million, while  the DARSO counts involved\nestimated loss  of $50,000  to $100,000.   See U.S.S.G.    2F1.1.\n                                              \nThe district court  imposed an 8-level enhancement, based  on the\n$500,000 to $1 million loss  occasioned by the SERVESS scheme, as\n\"relevant  conduct,\" see  id.    1B1.3, in  connection with  Wil-\n                             \nliams's sentencing  on the DARSO  scheme counts to which  he pled\nguilty.\n\n     2The pre-November 1989  Sentencing Guideline calculation was\nas follows:\n\n     Base offense level (  2F1.1)                 6\n     + Loss between $500,000 and $1 million      +8\n     + More than minimal planning                +2\n     + Abuse of trust position                   +2\n     - Acceptance of responsibility              -2\n\n     Adjusted offense level                      16\n\n     GSR (Criminal History Category I)           21-27 mos.\n     Downward departure for Substantial\n       Assistance                                -14 mos.\n\n     Sentence                                     7 mos.\n\n                                5\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          The  crux  of  Williams's grievance  is  that  his plea\n\nagreement with the government, which  led to the dismissal of the\n\nSERVESS counts, resulted  in no lower sentence  since the Common-\n\nwealth loss relating to the SERVESS counts was  considered \"rele-\n\nvant conduct\"  for purposes  of sentencing  on the DARSO  counts.\n\nOur cases, see, e.g., United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 440-\n                                             \n\n42 (1st Cir. 1989),  long since have recognized the  appropriate-\n\nness  of just  such  \"relevant  conduct\"  adjustments  as  these.\n\nMoreover, unlike \"relevant conduct\"  adjustments that may  appear\n\nto erode the intended benefit  of a defendant's plea bargain, see\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. Fox, 889  F.2d 357, 362-63 (1st Cir. 1989);  see\n                                                                 \n\nalso Kinder  v. United  States, 112 S.  Ct. 2290,  2292-93 (1992)\n                              \n\n(White, J., dissenting  from a denial of  certiorari) (collecting\n\ncases and noting  circuit split), in  this case Williams  plainly\n\nwas  on notice  that the  government would  request the  court to\n\ntreat  the SERVESS-related loss  as \"relevant conduct\"  under the\n\nDARSO counts.3 Finally,  while the government reserved  its right\n\n                    \n\n     3The plea agreement provides:\n\n          Williams  agrees that  the United  States may\n          argue that  the loss suffered . .  . from all\n          of the fifteen charged schemes to defraud set\n          forth in  predicate acts one  through fifteen\n          of  Count One  of the  indictment [i.e.,  the\n                                                 \n          SERVESS-related conduct]  may be  included by\n          the  court  in its  calculation  of  the loss\n          suffered  by  the Commonwealth  of  Massachu-\n          setts.   The Government  agrees that Mr. Wil-\n          liams  may argue that the Court should not do\n\n                                6\n\nto  recommend a \"relevant conduct\" adjustment, the plea agreement\n\nafforded Williams  significant benefit.   The  government agreed,\n\ninter  alia,  to move  to  dismiss all  RICO  and RICO-conspiracy\n           \n\ncounts, and to  recommend a sentence at the low-end of the appli-\n\ncable guideline sentencing range.   The government also left  the\n\ndoor open  to a  downward departure  for substantial  assistance.\n\nUltimately,  of course,  the district  court  granted a  downward\n\ndeparture for  substantial assistance, see  supra note 2,  on the\n                                                 \n\ngovernment's recommendation.  See U.S.S.G.   5K1.1. \n                                 \n\n          Thus, our  review discloses  that both  the letter  and\n\nspirit of the plea agreement was observed, resulting  in substan-\n\ntial benefit to Williams.   The fact that the district  court, in\n\nscrupulous  observance  of  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  and  our\n\ncaselaw,  did not  grant  appellant  all he  had  hoped does  not\n\nwarrant appellate relief.  \n\n1.   \"Relevant Conduct\"\n                      \n\n          Absent a mistake  of law, we review  \"relevant conduct\"\n\nfindings for clear  error.  United States v. Wood,  924 F.2d 399,\n                                                 \n\n403 (1st  Cir. 1991).    Only after  the government  has met  its\n\nburden  of establishing, by  a preponderance of  the evidence, \"a\n\nsufficient nexus between the [extraneous] conduct and the offense\n                \n\nof conviction,\" may  the sentencing court,  in its sound  discre-\n\ntion, make  a \"relevant  conduct\" adjustment.   United  States v.\n                                                              \n\n                    \n\n          so.\n\n                                7\n\nSklar, 920 F.2d 107, 110  (1st Cir. 1990) (emphasis added).   The\n     \n\ndistrict court supportably found the required nexus in this case.\n\n          The principal  argument advanced by Williams  on appeal\n\nis that the conduct allegedly  involved in the SERVESS scheme was\n\ntoo dissimilar  to be  considered \"relevant\"  to  the conduct  of\n\nconviction involved in the DARSO counts.4  This supposed dissimi-\n\nlarity springs  from the  fact that  Williams's alleged  criminal\n\nliability under the dismissed SERVESS  counts was predicated on a\n\ndetermination  that  Williams controlled  Polis,  thereby causing\n\nSERVESS  to violate its obligation to disclose \"related parties,\"\n\nwhereas criminal liability  for the DARSO scheme  rested directly\n\non the conduct of Williams and his codefendants.\n\n          The  SERVESS and DARSO  schemes shared a  great deal in\n\ncommon:   (1) the  same victim, i.e.,  the Commonwealth;  (2) the\n                                    \n\nsame method of  operation, i.e., SERVESS's improper  requests for\n                               \n\nCommonwealth  reimbursement of the  management fees paid  CSI, or\n\nthe  rental fees paid  for the real  estate trusts; (3)  the same\n\nthree principals, i.e., Williams and Kotek as influential \"insid-\n                      \n\ners,\" Alexander  as the  \"outsider\" recipient;  and (4)  the same\n\nunderlying substantive  offense, i.e., the  fraudulent failure to\n                                     \n\nidentify the  defendant's \"related  party\"  status in  accordance\n\n                    \n\n     4Appellant's  other  arguments  warrant  little  discussion.\nFirst, he  questions the temporal proximity between the DARSO and\nSERVESS schemes.   But  this argument ignores  the nature  of the\nunderlying  crime.  Assuming  arguendo that the  SERVESS contract\n                                      \nwith CSI was executed before  DARSO came into existence, the mail\nfraud,  based  on  the  continuing non-disclosure  of  Williams's\n                                                 \n\"related party\" status,  continued well beyond that date.  Appel-\nlant's second contention    that any control exercised over Polis\nwas \"intermittent\"    is likewise inapposite.  \n\n                                8\n\nwith 114.5 Mass. Reg. 3.02.   Thus, the district court reasonably\n\ncould conclude that the DARSO  and SERVESS schemes, while not one\n\nand the same, were nonetheless sufficiently comparable in charac-\n\nter, cast and  plot, to warrant similar billing  under U.S.S.G.  \n\n1B1.3.\n\n2.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n                                \n\n          The second argument Williams makes is that the evidence\n\nwas insufficient  to link him to the  SERVESS scheme.  The eight-\n\nlevel  adjustment under U.S.S.G.   1B1.3 was based exclusively on\n\nthe  government's  contention  that  Williams controlled  Polis's\n\napproval of the CSI management contract, and the long-term leases\n\nwith the  real estate  trusts, on  behalf of  SERVESS.  The  only\n\n\"control\"  evidence introduced  at sentencing  was Polis's  grand\n\njury testimony, which  Williams correctly characterizes as  hear-\n\nsay.  Williams insists that the grand jury testimony was rendered\n\neven  less  reliable because  the  prosecutor posed  a  series of\n\nhostile or leading questions to  Polis on the issue of \"control.\"\n\nMoreover, Williams argues, Polis  testified that following  their\n\nresignations  from the  SERVESS  Board  in  August  1984  neither\n\nWilliams nor Kotek had the power to remove Polis as the executive\n\ndirector of SERVESS, and  that Polis named a new board  of direc-\n\ntors, increased his  own salary, and  leased other properties  in\n\nwhich Williams had no ownership interest.\n\n          Given the deferential \"clear error\" standard of review,\n\nUnited States v.

Compare, e.g., Zuleta-\n                                                                 \n\nAlvarez,  922 F.2d at  37 (upholding consideration  of grand jury\n       \n\ntestimony where sentencing  judge presided over trial  and formed\n\nindependent  assessment of  reliability),  with United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nHarris, 982 F.2d  317 (8th Cir. 1992) (upholding  refusal to rely\n      \n\non  grand jury  testimony  where  sentencing  judge  doubted  its\n\nveracity). \n\n          The sentencing  judge was  highly conversant  both with\n\nthe facts of the case and Williams's association  and involvement\n\nwith his  codefendants in the SERVESS  scheme.  By  the time Wil-\n\nliams was  sentenced, the judge not  only had the benefit  of the\n\npresentence investigation report and Williams's written response,\n\nbut the understanding gained from more than two years of pretrial\n\nproceedings.   Indeed,  a few  weeks earlier  the same  judge had\n\nsentenced  Alexander  and Kotek  on  the  SERVESS and  the  DARSO\n                                                     \n\ncounts.   Cf. Zuleta-Alvarez,  922 F.2d at  37 (holding  that en-\n                            \n\nhanced deference was due findings  of fact where sentencing judge\n\nhad presided at trial).\n\n          The  district  court  supportably  found  that  Polis's\n\nactions on behalf of SERVESS  in entering into the CSI management\n\ncontract were controlled by Williams. \n\n3.   Evidentiary Hearing\n                        \n\n          Finally,  Williams  argues  that  the district  court's\n\nrefusal  to allow an  evidentiary hearing,  at which  Polis could\n\n                                12\n\nhave been cross-examined, constituted an abuse of discretion.  We\n\nhave yet to hold that it is an abuse of discretion to deny cross-\n\nexamination  in the  sentencing context.   See  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nRegan, 989 F.2d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 1993).\n     \n\n          Williams  has not demonstrated  an abuse  of discretion\n\nhere.  See  Garcia, 954  F.2d at  19.  Even  though, as  Williams\n                  \n\nalleges,  the Polis grand jury testimony on \"control\" was central\n\nto  the \"relevant  conduct\" adjustment  relating  to the  SERVESS\n\ncounts,  we cannot  say that  the district  court, which  had the\n\nbenefit of the grand jury transcript and its own long-term famil-\n\niarity  with these proceedings,  was presented with  a compelling\n\nbasis  for conducting an evidentiary  hearing to revisit the same\n\nground.   Williams  was accorded  an opportunity  to contest,  in\n\nwriting, the  government's evidence of \"control.\"  Yet he neither\n\nproffered rebuttal evidence  nor alleged or identified  any false\n\ngrand jury testimony by Polis,  but simply disputed the import of\n\nPolis's testimony  by denying  \"control\" without  suggesting what\n\nadditional  or different information might be gleaned from cross-\n\nexamining  Polis.  Williams's  sheer earnestness in  pursuing the\n\nrequest was not enough.   In these circumstances, and absent some\n\nmore  concrete  proffer, the  district  court did  not  abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying an evidentiary hearing.  \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                                13\n",

(SERVESS), a Massachusetts not-for-profit corporation which operated homes for the handicapped.  SERVESS entered into at-cost contracts with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Commonwealth) for the placement of mentally handicapped persons in SERVESS group homes.  These contracts entitled SERVESS to reimbursement for its expenses but prohibited it from realizing a profit.  In 1984, while serving on the SERVESS board of directors, Williams and Kotek established Community Services, Inc.  (CSI), a for-profit corporation which would contract with companies like SERVESS to operate their group homes in return for a management fee.  In July 1984, Williams and Kotek, in their capacity as SERVESS directors:  (1) voted to enter into a management contract with CSI;  (2) promoted a SERVESS employee, William Polis, to serve as SERVESS's new executive director;  and (3) resigned from the SERVESS Board effective August 31, 1984.  On September 1, 1984, the day after the Williams and Kotek resignations became effective, the SERVESS-CSI management contract was executed by Polis on behalf of SERVESS.  In 1985, during Polis's tenure, at the instance of Williams and Kotek SERVESS entered into several long-term leases of property owned by real estate trusts controlled by the third codefendant, Robert Alexander.  Although only Alexander received income from these properties, Kotek, Williams and Alexander were all residual beneficiaries under the real estate trusts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1986, Williams and Kotek founded another not-for-profit corporation called D.A.R.S.O., Inc.  (DARSO), which operated day-care centers for mentally handicapped persons.  Like SERVESS, DARSO contracted directly with the Commonwealth for reimbursement of its at-cost expenses, and leased several parcels of real property from the same real estate trusts.  DARSO also purchased furniture from a company in which Williams held an interest.  Williams served as a director of DARSO from its inception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law requires that any not-for-profit corporation submitting expense reimbursement requests to the Commonwealth disclose whether the expense was incurred with a \"related person,\" defined as \"[a] person or organization which is associated or affiliated with or has control of or is controlled by the [not-for-profit corporation] or is related to the [not-for-profit corporation] or any director, stockholder, trustee, partner or administrator of the [not-for-profit corporation] by common ownership or control or in a manner specified in [I.R.C. Sec. 267(b), (c).]\"   See 114.5 Mass.Reg. 3.02 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1990, Williams, Kotek, Alexander, and the various corporate entities were indicted for RICO violations, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c), RICO conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d), and multiple counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, in connection with the alleged SERVESS and DARSO schemes to defraud the Commonwealth.  The indictment was based on Williams's failure to disclose:  (1) that he and Kotek, through executive director Polis, \"controlled\" SERVESS at the time CSI and SERVESS entered into their management contract;  and (2) that both corporations leased property from real estate trusts whose beneficiaries were \"related parties.\"   The government charged that the SERVESS and DARSO reimbursement requests exceeded their costs, and that Williams and Kotek defrauded the Commonwealth by using these \"hidden profits\" to improve, and acquire equity in, the real estate leased to SERVESS and DARSO by the real estate trusts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the government characterized the dismissed SERVESS counts as \"relevant conduct\" under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3 and introduced a transcript of the grand jury testimony of William Polis, to the effect that he was acting under Williams's \"control\" when he signed the SERVESS-CSI management contract in September 1984.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Williams argued that the SERVESS scheme was too remote in time and context to constitute \"relevant conduct\" under the DARSO counts, and requested an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of cross-examining Polis on his grand jury testimony concerning the issue of \"control.\"   The district court denied the request for an evidentiary hearing and found the loss occasioned by the SERVESS counts to be \"relevant conduct.\"   Williams appeals the resulting seven-month prison sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of Williams's grievance is that his plea agreement with the government, which led to the dismissal of the SERVESS counts, resulted in no lower sentence since the Commonwealth loss relating to the SERVESS counts was considered \"relevant conduct\" for purposes of sentencing on the DARSO counts.  Our cases, see, e.g., United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 440-42 (1st Cir.1989), long since have recognized the appropriateness of just such \"relevant conduct\" adjustments as these.  Moreover, unlike \"relevant conduct\" adjustments that may appear to erode the intended benefit of a defendant's plea bargain, see United States v. Fox, 889 F.2d 357, 362-63 (1st Cir.1989);  see also Kinder v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. 2290, 2292-93, 119 L.Ed.2d 214 (1992) (White, J., dissenting from a denial of certiorari) (collecting cases and noting circuit split), in this case Williams plainly was on notice that the government would request the court to treat the SERVESS-related loss as \"relevant conduct\" under the DARSO counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Finally, while the government reserved its right to recommend a \"relevant conduct\" adjustment, the plea agreement afforded Williams significant benefit.  The government agreed, inter alia, to move to dismiss all RICO and RICO-conspiracy counts, and to recommend a sentence at the low-end of the applicable guideline sentencing range.  The government also left the door open to a downward departure for substantial assistance.  Ultimately, of course, the district court granted a downward departure for substantial assistance, see supra note 2, on the government's recommendation.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, our review discloses that both the letter and spirit of the plea agreement was observed, resulting in substantial benefit to Williams.  The fact that the district court, in scrupulous observance of the Sentencing Guidelines and our caselaw, did not grant appellant all he had hoped does not warrant appellate relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>1. \"Relevant Conduct\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a mistake of law, we review \"relevant conduct\" findings for clear error.  United States v. Wood, 924 F.2d 399, 403 (1st Cir.1991).  Only after the government has met its burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, \"a sufficient nexus between the [extraneous] conduct and the offense of conviction,\" may the sentencing court, in its sound discretion, make a \"relevant conduct\" adjustment.  United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 110 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis added).  The district court supportably found the required nexus in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal argument advanced by Williams on appeal is that the conduct allegedly involved in the SERVESS scheme was too dissimilar to be considered \"relevant\" to the conduct of conviction involved in the DARSO counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  This supposed dissimilarity springs from the fact that Williams's alleged criminal liability under the dismissed SERVESS counts was predicated on a determination that Williams controlled Polis, thereby causing SERVESS to violate its obligation to disclose \"related parties,\" whereas criminal liability for the DARSO scheme rested directly on the conduct of Williams and his codefendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SERVESS and DARSO schemes shared a great deal in common:  (1) the same victim, i.e., the Commonwealth;  (2) the same method of operation, i.e., SERVESS's improper requests for Commonwealth reimbursement of the management fees paid CSI, or the rental fees paid for the real estate trusts;  (3) the same three principals, i.e., Williams and Kotek as influential \"insiders,\" Alexander as the \"outsider\" recipient;  and (4) the same underlying substantive offense, i.e., the fraudulent failure to identify the defendant's \"related party\" status in accordance with 114.5 Mass.Reg. 3.02.  Thus, the district court reasonably could conclude that the DARSO and SERVESS schemes, while not one and the same, were nonetheless sufficiently comparable in character, cast and plot, to warrant similar billing under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second argument Williams makes is that the evidence was insufficient to link him to the SERVESS scheme.  The eight-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3 was based exclusively on the government's contention that Williams controlled Polis's approval of the CSI management contract, and the long-term leases with the real estate trusts, on behalf of SERVESS.  The only \"control\" evidence introduced at sentencing was Polis's grand jury testimony, which Williams correctly characterizes as hearsay.  Williams insists that the grand jury testimony was rendered even less reliable because the prosecutor posed a series of hostile or leading questions to Polis on the issue of \"control.\"   Moreover, Williams argues, Polis testified that following their resignations from the SERVESS Board in August 1984 neither Williams nor Kotek had the power to remove Polis as the executive director of SERVESS, and that Polis named a new board of directors, increased his own salary, and leased other properties in which Williams had no ownership interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the deferential \"clear error\" standard of review, United States v. Zuleta- Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33, 36 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2039, 114 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991), and the modest burden and quality of proof incumbent on the government at sentencing, id. at 37 (citing  United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.1989)), Williams's claim founders on the plain language in U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3(a):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>In resolving any reasonable dispute concerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3(a), we repeatedly have upheld reliance on prior hearsay testimony never subjected to cross-examination, so long as there were other adequate indicia of reliability.  See, e.g., Wright, 873 F.2d at 441.   Here, the Polis testimony was given under oath, subject to the penalties of perjury, in a formal grand jury proceeding that resulted in Williams's indictment on the DARSO counts, as well as the SERVESS counts which were dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement.  The district court was provided with the complete transcript of the Polis grand jury testimony, wherein Polis admitted, inter alia, that Williams was still \"calling the shots\" during the first two years Polis served as President of SERVESS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The Polis testimony was the only direct evidence before the district court on Williams's influence upon Polis.  So far as the record discloses, the Polis testimony was also the only direct evidence before the grand jury on the issue of Williams's \"control,\" and would appear to have been critical to the \"probable cause\" determination on which Williams's indictment on the SERVESS counts was based.  In these circumstances, we think there can be little question that the Polis grand jury testimony was sufficiently reliable to permit reliance by the sentencing court.  Compare, e.g., Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d at 37 (upholding consideration of grand jury testimony where sentencing judge presided over trial and formed independent assessment of reliability), with United States v. Harris, 982 F.2d 317 (8th Cir.1992) (upholding refusal to rely on grand jury testimony where sentencing judge doubted its veracity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing judge was highly conversant both with the facts of the case and Williams's association and involvement with his codefendants in the SERVESS scheme.  By the time Williams was sentenced, the judge not only had the benefit of the presentence investigation report and Williams's written response, but the understanding gained from more than two years of pretrial proceedings.  Indeed, a few weeks earlier the same judge had sentenced Alexander and Kotek on the SERVESS and the DARSO counts.  Cf. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d at 37 (holding that enhanced deference was due findings of fact where sentencing judge had presided at trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court supportably found that Polis's actions on behalf of SERVESS in entering into the CSI management contract were controlled by Williams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Williams argues that the district court's refusal to allow an evidentiary hearing, at which Polis could have been cross-examined, constituted an abuse of discretion.  We have yet to hold that it is an abuse of discretion to deny cross-examination in the sentencing context.  See United States v.

See United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1992).  Even though, as Williams alleges, the Polis grand jury testimony on \"control\" was central to the \"relevant conduct\" adjustment relating to the SERVESS counts, we cannot say that the district court, which had the benefit of the grand jury transcript and its own long-term familiarity with these proceedings, was presented with a compelling basis for conducting an evidentiary hearing to revisit the same ground.  Williams was accorded an opportunity to contest, in writing, the government's evidence of \"control.\"   Yet he neither proffered rebuttal evidence nor alleged or identified any false grand jury testimony by Polis, but simply disputed the import of Polis's testimony by denying \"control\" without suggesting what additional or different information might be gleaned from cross-examining Polis.  Williams's sheer earnestness in pursuing the request was not enough.  In these circumstances, and absent some more concrete proffer, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The gross loss occasioned the Commonwealth by the mail fraud directly related to the SERVESS counts was estimated at between $500,000 and $1 million, while the DARSO counts involved estimated loss of $50,000 to $100,000.

(SERVESS), a Massachusetts not-for-profit corporation which operated homes for the handicapped.  SERVESS entered into at-cost contracts with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Commonwealth) for the placement of mentally handicapped persons in SERVESS group homes.  These contracts entitled SERVESS to reimbursement for its expenses but prohibited it from realizing a profit.  In 1984, while serving on the SERVESS board of directors, Williams and Kotek established Community Services, Inc.  (CSI), a for-profit corporation which would contract with companies like SERVESS to operate their group homes in return for a management fee.  In July 1984, Williams and Kotek, in their capacity as SERVESS directors:  (1) voted to enter into a management contract with CSI;  (2) promoted a SERVESS employee, William Polis, to serve as SERVESS's new executive director;  and (3) resigned from the SERVESS Board effective August 31, 1984.  On September 1, 1984, the day after the Williams and Kotek resignations became effective, the SERVESS-CSI management contract was executed by Polis on behalf of SERVESS.  In 1985, during Polis's tenure, at the instance of Williams and Kotek SERVESS entered into several long-term leases of property owned by real estate trusts controlled by the third codefendant, Robert Alexander.  Although only Alexander received income from these properties, Kotek, Williams and Alexander were all residual beneficiaries under the real estate trusts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1986, Williams and Kotek founded another not-for-profit corporation called D.A.R.S.O., Inc.  (DARSO), which operated day-care centers for mentally handicapped persons.  Like SERVESS, DARSO contracted directly with the Commonwealth for reimbursement of its at-cost expenses, and leased several parcels of real property from the same real estate trusts.  DARSO also purchased furniture from a company in which Williams held an interest.  Williams served as a director of DARSO from its inception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law requires that any not-for-profit corporation submitting expense reimbursement requests to the Commonwealth disclose whether the expense was incurred with a \"related person,\" defined as \"[a] person or organization which is associated or affiliated with or has control of or is controlled by the [not-for-profit corporation] or is related to the [not-for-profit corporation] or any director, stockholder, trustee, partner or administrator of the [not-for-profit corporation] by common ownership or control or in a manner specified in [I.R.C. Sec. 267(b), (c).]\"   See 114.5 Mass.Reg. 3.02 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1990, Williams, Kotek, Alexander, and the various corporate entities were indicted for RICO violations, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c), RICO conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d), and multiple counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, in connection with the alleged SERVESS and DARSO schemes to defraud the Commonwealth.  The indictment was based on Williams's failure to disclose:  (1) that he and Kotek, through executive director Polis, \"controlled\" SERVESS at the time CSI and SERVESS entered into their management contract;  and (2) that both corporations leased property from real estate trusts whose beneficiaries were \"related parties.\"   The government charged that the SERVESS and DARSO reimbursement requests exceeded their costs, and that Williams and Kotek defrauded the Commonwealth by using these \"hidden profits\" to improve, and acquire equity in, the real estate leased to SERVESS and DARSO by the real estate trusts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the government characterized the dismissed SERVESS counts as \"relevant conduct\" under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3 and introduced a transcript of the grand jury testimony of William Polis, to the effect that he was acting under Williams's \"control\" when he signed the SERVESS-CSI management contract in September 1984.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Williams argued that the SERVESS scheme was too remote in time and context to constitute \"relevant conduct\" under the DARSO counts, and requested an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of cross-examining Polis on his grand jury testimony concerning the issue of \"control.\"   The district court denied the request for an evidentiary hearing and found the loss occasioned by the SERVESS counts to be \"relevant conduct.\"   Williams appeals the resulting seven-month prison sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of Williams's grievance is that his plea agreement with the government, which led to the dismissal of the SERVESS counts, resulted in no lower sentence since the Commonwealth loss relating to the SERVESS counts was considered \"relevant conduct\" for purposes of sentencing on the DARSO counts.  Our cases, see, e.g., United States v. Wright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522147\"><a href=\"/opinion/522147/united-states-v-bertie-alexander-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span>, 440-42 (1st Cir.1989), long since have recognized the appropriateness of just such \"relevant conduct\" adjustments as these.  Moreover, unlike \"relevant conduct\" adjustments that may appear to erode the intended benefit of a defendant's plea bargain, see United States v. Fox, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532028\"><a href=\"/opinion/532028/united-states-v-carolyn-l-fox/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 362-63 (1st Cir.1989);  see also Kinder v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></span> (1992) (White, J., dissenting from a denial of certiorari) (collecting cases and noting circuit split), in this case Williams plainly was on notice that the government would request the court to treat the SERVESS-related loss as \"relevant conduct\" under the DARSO counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Finally, while the government reserved its right to recommend a \"relevant conduct\" adjustment, the plea agreement afforded Williams significant benefit.  The government agreed, inter alia, to move to dismiss all RICO and RICO-conspiracy counts, and to recommend a sentence at the low-end of the applicable guideline sentencing range.  The government also left the door open to a downward departure for substantial assistance.  Ultimately, of course, the district court granted a downward departure for substantial assistance, see supra note 2, on the government's recommendation.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, our review discloses that both the letter and spirit of the plea agreement was observed, resulting in substantial benefit to Williams.  The fact that the district court, in scrupulous observance of the Sentencing Guidelines and our caselaw, did not grant appellant all he had hoped does not warrant appellate relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>1. \"Relevant Conduct\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a mistake of law, we review \"relevant conduct\" findings for clear error.  United States v. Wood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555054\"><a href=\"/opinion/555054/united-states-v-darryl-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 403 (1st Cir.1991).  Only after the government has met its burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, \"a sufficient nexus between the [extraneous] conduct and the offense of conviction,\" may the sentencing court, in its sound discretion, make a \"relevant conduct\" adjustment.  United States v. Sklar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis added).  The district court supportably found the required nexus in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal argument advanced by Williams on appeal is that the conduct allegedly involved in the SERVESS scheme was too dissimilar to be considered \"relevant\" to the conduct of conviction involved in the DARSO counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  This supposed dissimilarity springs from the fact that Williams's alleged criminal liability under the dismissed SERVESS counts was predicated on a determination that Williams controlled Polis, thereby causing SERVESS to violate its obligation to disclose \"related parties,\" whereas criminal liability for the DARSO scheme rested directly on the conduct of Williams and his codefendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SERVESS and DARSO schemes shared a great deal in common:  (1) the same victim, i.e., the Commonwealth;  (2) the same method of operation, i.e., SERVESS's improper requests for Commonwealth reimbursement of the management fees paid CSI, or the rental fees paid for the real estate trusts;  (3) the same three principals, i.e., Williams and Kotek as influential \"insiders,\" Alexander as the \"outsider\" recipient;  and (4) the same underlying substantive offense, i.e., the fraudulent failure to identify the defendant's \"related party\" status in accordance with 114.5 Mass.Reg. 3.02.  Thus, the district court reasonably could conclude that the DARSO and SERVESS schemes, while not one and the same, were nonetheless sufficiently comparable in character, cast and plot, to warrant similar billing under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second argument Williams makes is that the evidence was insufficient to link him to the SERVESS scheme.  The eight-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3 was based exclusively on the government's contention that Williams controlled Polis's approval of the CSI management contract, and the long-term leases with the real estate trusts, on behalf of SERVESS.  The only \"control\" evidence introduced at sentencing was Polis's grand jury testimony, which Williams correctly characterizes as hearsay.  Williams insists that the grand jury testimony was rendered even less reliable because the prosecutor posed a series of hostile or leading questions to Polis on the issue of \"control.\"   Moreover, Williams argues, Polis testified that following their resignations from the SERVESS Board in August 1984 neither Williams nor Kotek had the power to remove Polis as the executive director of SERVESS, and that Polis named a new board of directors, increased his own salary, and leased other properties in which Williams had no ownership interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the deferential \"clear error\" standard of review, United States v.

Sec. 6A1.3(a), we repeatedly have upheld reliance on prior hearsay testimony never subjected to cross-examination, so long as there were other adequate indicia of reliability.  See, e.g., Wright, 873 F.2d at 441.   Here, the Polis testimony was given under oath, subject to the penalties of perjury, in a formal grand jury proceeding that resulted in Williams's indictment on the DARSO counts, as well as the SERVESS counts which were dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement.  The district court was provided with the complete transcript of the Polis grand jury testimony, wherein Polis admitted, inter alia, that Williams was still \"calling the shots\" during the first two years Polis served as President of SERVESS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The Polis testimony was the only direct evidence before the district court on Williams's influence upon Polis.  So far as the record discloses, the Polis testimony was also the only direct evidence before the grand jury on the issue of Williams's \"control,\" and would appear to have been critical to the \"probable cause\" determination on which Williams's indictment on the SERVESS counts was based.  In these circumstances, we think there can be little question that the Polis grand jury testimony was sufficiently reliable to permit reliance by the sentencing court.  Compare, e.g., Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d at 37 (upholding consideration of grand jury testimony where sentencing judge presided over trial and formed independent assessment of reliability), with United States v. Harris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597196\"><a href=\"/opinion/597196/united-states-of-america-appelleecross-appellant-v-harvey-raymond/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1992) (upholding refusal to rely on grand jury testimony where sentencing judge doubted its veracity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing judge was highly conversant both with the facts of the case and Williams's association and involvement with his codefendants in the SERVESS scheme.  By the time Williams was sentenced, the judge not only had the benefit of the presentence investigation report and Williams's written response, but the understanding gained from more than two years of pretrial proceedings.  Indeed, a few weeks earlier the same judge had sentenced Alexander and Kotek on the SERVESS and the DARSO counts.  Cf. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d at 37 (holding that enhanced deference was due findings of fact where sentencing judge had presided at trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court supportably found that Polis's actions on behalf of SERVESS in entering into the CSI management contract were controlled by Williams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Williams argues that the district court's refusal to allow an evidentiary hearing, at which Polis could have been cross-examined, constituted an abuse of discretion.  We have yet to hold that it is an abuse of discretion to deny cross-examination in the sentencing context.  See United States v. Regan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602836\"><a href=\"/opinion/602836/united-states-v-peter-j-regan/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Williams has not demonstrated an abuse of discretion here.

Even though, as Williams alleges, the Polis grand jury testimony on \"control\" was central to the \"relevant conduct\" adjustment relating to the SERVESS counts, we cannot say that the district court, which had the benefit of the grand jury transcript and its own long-term familiarity with these proceedings, was presented with a compelling basis for conducting an evidentiary hearing to revisit the same ground.  Williams was accorded an opportunity to contest, in writing, the government's evidence of \"control.\"   Yet he neither proffered rebuttal evidence nor alleged or identified any false grand jury testimony by Polis, but simply disputed the import of Polis's testimony by denying \"control\" without suggesting what additional or different information might be gleaned from cross-examining Polis.  Williams's sheer earnestness in pursuing the request was not enough.  In these circumstances, and absent some more concrete proffer, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The gross loss occasioned the Commonwealth by the mail fraud directly related to the SERVESS counts was estimated at between $500,000 and $1 million, while the DARSO counts involved estimated loss of $50,000 to $100,000.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1.  The district court imposed an 8-level enhancement, based on the $500,000 to $1 million, loss occasioned by the SERVESS scheme, as \"relevant conduct,\" see id.

The Government agrees that Mr. Williams may argue that the Court should not do so.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Appellant's other arguments warrant little discussion.  First, he questions the temporal proximity between the DARSO and SERVESS schemes.  But this argument ignores the nature of the underlying crime.  Assuming arguendo that the SERVESS contract with CSI was executed before DARSO came into existence, the mail fraud, based on the continuing non-disclosure of Williams's \"related party\" status, continued well beyond that date.  Appellant's second contention--that any control exercised over Polis was \"intermittent\"--is likewise inapposite</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Polis testified as follows:</p>\n        <p>Q: But, Mr. Polis, [why did you sign] a document [the SERVESS-CSI management contract] you had never seen before, a document in which you played no role in the negotiation of on your first day on the job, which obligated your entity to five years relationship with [CSI].  What is the reason you signed it?</p>\n        <p>A: I didn't really feel I had the choice.</p>\n        <p>Q: And what was--what was it that was taking away your ability to have a choice?</p>\n        <p>A: Stephen Williams and Bruce Kotek.</p>\n        <p>Q: How?</p>\n        <p>A: The fact that they had the contracts and the control.</p>\n        <p>Q: Mr. Polis, in the sort of natural scheme of human relationships, two people who are running an entity don't voluntarily relinquish all control over it to somebody else on the faint hope that person will turn control right back to them in a consulting agreement or leave control with them by letting them do what they want to do in terms of who they execute leases with and the like.</p>\n        <p>Is it your testimony that there was no conversation ... in which you indicated that you would continue to do their bidding as director of SERVESS?</p>\n        <p>A: There was a discussion about they had gone to the state, they had gone to an attorney, they were coming up with an agreement and that they wanted it signed and that they would become the management entity and I would run the programs.</p>\n        <p>Q: Well didn't somebody ever say at any point in time you're going to continue to do as we tell you to do, Bill.
