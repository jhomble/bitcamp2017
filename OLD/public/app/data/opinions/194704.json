An involuntary chapter 7 petition\n          CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                            \n\nwas filed against Mark  Bell Furniture Warehouse, Inc. (\"Debtor\")\n\nin 1988.   The property of  the chapter 7 estate  included a pre-\n\npetition cause of  action against D. M. Reid Associates (\"Reid\").\n\nMark  Bell (\"Bell\"),  Debtor's  president and  sole  shareholder,\n\nurged the chapter 7  trustee to litigate the claim  against Reid.\n\nWhen  the trustee  failed to  pursue the  claim, Bell  offered to\n\npurchase  the cause  of action  from the  estate for  $250.   The\n\nnotice of the proposed private sale to Bell invited upset bids in\n\nexcess of $500, subject to the condition that qualifying  bidders\n\nwould be asked to submit competing sealed  bids at auction.  Reid\n\nsubmitted an upset bid in the amount of $501.\n\n          At the  auction sale  conducted  before the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt on March 9, 1992, Bell submitted a sealed bid for $1000 and\n\nReid  bid \"$1000 plus the amount of [Bell's bid].\"  Although both\n\nthe  trustee and the bankruptcy  judge voiced concerns  as to the\n\npropriety  of Reid's  \"relative\" bid,  neither Bell  nor Debtor's\n\ncounsel objected.  The trustee accepted Reid's $2000 bid.  Debtor\n\ndid  not seek to stay the sale.   Three days later, Reid tendered\n\n$2000 to the trustee, and the trustee delivered a bill of sale.\n\n          Debtor appealed  to the district court, contending that\n\nReid's  relative bid should be declared void and that the trustee\n\nshould  be directed  to accept  Bell's lower  bid.   The district\n\n                                2\n\ncourt  dismissed the appeal as moot, based on Debtor's failure to\n\nobtain a stay of the sale pending appeal.1\n\n          Absent a stay pending  appeal, Bankruptcy Code   363(m)\n\nprecludes appellate relief  invalidating a sale to a \"good faith\"\n\npurchaser.  See In re Onouli-Kona  Land Co., 846 F.2d 1170, 1171-\n                                           \n\n72 (9th Cir. 1988).

See In re\n                                                                 \n\nSax,  796 F.2d 994, 998  (7th Cir. 1986);  International Union v.\n                                                              \n\nMorse Tool,  Inc., 85  B.R. 666,  667 (D. Mass.  1988).   A \"good\n                 \n\nfaith\"  purchaser is one who buys property  in good faith and for\n\nvalue, without knowledge of  adverse claims.  In re  Tri-Cran, 98\n                                                             \n\nB.R. at  615-19 (citing  Greylock Glen  Corp.  v.

Kivitz, 764 F.2d 1019, 1023 (4th Cir. 1985);\n                           \n\nIn re Bel Air Assocs., Ltd., 706 F.2d 301, 305 (10th Cir. 1983).\n                           \n\n          In its  appeal to the district  court, Debtor contended\n\nthat \"relative\" or \"sharp\" bids are illegal per se, hence grossly\n                                                  \n\nunfair,  see, e.g., Holliday v.  Higbee, 172 F.2d  316, 318 (10th\n                                       \n\nCir. 1949);  Trump v. Mason, 190 F.  Supp. 887, 888 (D.D.C. 1961)\n                           \n\n(noting that relative bids \"destroy the integrity of the [sealed]\n\nbidding  system\").2   Thus,  Debtor argued,  Reid  became a  \"bad\n\nfaith\" purchaser  merely by submitting  the unannounced  relative\n\nbid.3  The  district court recognized the \"problematic\" nature of\n\nthe  \"bad  faith\" claim  urged by  Debtor,  but decided  that the\n\npresumed \"evil\"  of relative bidding  lay in concealing  the fact\n\nthat a relative  bid had prevailed.  The court  concluded that no\n\n\"bad faith\"  was shown on the part of Reid since all auction par-\n\nticipants (and bystanders) were  informed of Reid's relative bid,\n\n                    \n\n     2The notices of  appeal filed in  the bankruptcy court,  see\n                                                                 \nFed.

Accordingly, Bell is not\na party  to the present  appeal.  Pontarelli  v. Stone,  930 F.2d\n                                                      \n104, 108 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (holding that court  of appeals  lacks\njurisdiction  of  appeal by  party  not designated  in  notice of\nappeal as required under Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)).\n\n     3\"Relative\" or  \"sharp\" bidding  is highly unusual  in bank-\nruptcy cases.  Although we do not condone its unannounced use, we\nleave  for another day whether relative bidding is ever appropri-\nate or practicable in the context of a judicial sale.\n\n                                4\n\nwere afforded  an opportunity  to  object to  it, and  acquiesced\n\nuntil well after the bid was accepted and the sale consummated.\n\n          Debtor again argues on appeal that the relative bidding\n\nwhich  took place in this case amounted  to \"bad faith.\"  We need\n\nnot decide this claim,  however, because it was not  preserved in\n\nthe bankruptcy  court.  See  In re LaRoche,  969 F.2d  1299, 1305\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (arguments not raised  in bankruptcy court cannot\n\nbe raised  for the first time on appeal) (citing In re 604 Colum-\n                                                                 \n\nbus  Ave. Realty  Trust, 968  F.2d 1332,  1343 (1st  Cir. 1992)).\n                       \n\nDebtor  had ample  opportunity  to  object  to the  relative  bid\n\nsubmitted by  Reid, the trustee's  acceptance of Reid's  bid, and\n\nthe consummation of the sale.  After the sealed bids were opened,\n\nthe  bankruptcy  judge and  the  trustee engaged  in  an extended\n\ndiscussion  as   to  the  appropriateness  of  relative  bidding.\n\nAlthough  both Bell  and Debtor's  counsel were  present, neither\n\nchallenged the  propriety of  the bid  or the  bidding.   Nor did\n\nDebtor request a stay.   In sum, at no time did  the Debtor alert\n\nthe bankruptcy  court to the  \"unfairness\" claim later  raised in\n\nits appeal to the district court.4\n\n                    \n\n     4At oral argument, Debtor disclaimed any contention whatever\nthat relative bidding, per se, violates public policy, or that it\n                             \ncontravenes  the  policy  favoring  maximization  of  liquidation\nrecoveries in  bankruptcy proceedings.   Debtor's retreat  to its\n\"unfair surprise\" claim completely undermined its earlier conten-\ntion that Reid's relative bid  was void ab initio.  See  Short v.\n                                                              \nSun Newspapers, Inc., 300 N.W.2d 781  (Minn. 1980).  Accordingly,\n                    \nDebtor's  remaining claim    that Bell  was unfairly surprised by\nReid's  relative bid    might  portend, at most,  that Reid's bid\nwas voidable upon timely objection by an unsuccessful bidder.\n            \n\n                                5\n\n          Appellate claim preclusion is especially appropriate in\n\nthese circumstances,  where a  timely objection before  the bank-\n\nruptcy court  might well have  enabled the  prompt submission  of\n\nnonrelative  bids by  the assembled  participants.   At  the very\n   \n\nleast, it  would  have permitted  the  bankruptcy court  to  make\n\nfindings of  fact and conclusions  of law as to  whether any cog-\n\nnizable unfairness occurred in this case.  See Poliquin v. Garden\n                                                                 \n\nWay, Inc.,      F.2d    ,     (1st Cir. 1993)  [Nos. 92-1115, 92-\n         \n\n1116, slip op. at 8 (1st Cir. Mar. 24, 1993)]  (explaining impor-\n\ntance  of  \"raise or  waive\"  rule in  the  litigation \"winnowing\n\nprocess,\"  as it  enables courts  to \"narrow  what remains  to be\n\ndecided[;] [i]f lawyers could pursue on appeal issues not proper-\n\nly raised below, there  would be little incentive to get it right\n\nthe first time and no end of retrials\").\n\n          Even  assuming its  \"unfairness\" claim  were preserved,\n\nhowever, Debtor  would lack \"standing\" to  assert it.  See  In re\n                                                                 \n\nDein Host,  Inc., 835 F.2d  402, 404  (1st Cir.  1987) (court  of\n                \n\nappeals  \"duty  bound\"  to  undertake  preliminary  inquiry  into\n\n\"standing\").  Debtor  does not  allege that it  is an  \"aggrieved\n\nperson,\"  nor  does the  record  indicate  that Debtor  possesses\n\n\"standing.\"   See, e.g., Rumford  Pharmacy, Inc. v.  City of East\n                                                                 \n\nProvidence,  970  F.2d  996,  1001 (1st  Cir.  1992)  (\"standing\"\n          \n\nrequires, inter  alia, \"personal  injury fairly traceable  to the\n                     \n\nallegedly  unlawful conduct\");  see also  In re Lovitt,  757 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1035, 1039 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 849 (1985).\n                                   \n\n                                6\n\n          First, all the Debtor's property became property of the\n\nchapter  7 estate long before  the auction sale.   See Bankruptcy\n                                                      \n\nCode    303, 541; 11 U.S.C.    303, 541.  The  chapter 7 trustee,\n\nnot  the  chapter 7  debtor,  is responsible  for  collecting all\n\nproperty of the estate and reducing  it to money.  See Bankruptcy\n                                                      \n\nCode   704(1); 11  U.S.C.   704(1);  cf. Fed. R.  Bankr.

Second, it  is\n\nwell established that a chapter  7 debtor generally lacks \"stand-\n\ning\" to  challenge a bankruptcy court judgment  confirming a sale\n\nof property of the chapter 7 estate:\n\n          A chapter 7 debtor  is not considered a \"per-\n          son aggrieved,\"  as  [it] lacks  a  pecuniary\n          interest  in  the \"property  of  the estate.\"\n          There are two exceptions:   (1) if the debtor\n          can show  that a successful appeal would gen-\n          erate  assets in excess of liabilities, enti-\n          tling the debtor to a distribution of surplus\n          under Bankruptcy Code    726(a)(6), 11 U.S.C.\n            726(a)(6), or (2)  the order appealed  from\n          affects the  terms of the  debtor's discharge\n          in bankruptcy.\n\nIn re Thompson, 965 F.2d 1136,  1144 (1st Cir. 1992); see also In\n                                                                 \n\nre  Goodwin's  Discount  Furniture,  Inc., 16  B.R.  885,  887-88\n                                         \n\n(Bankr. 1st  Cir. 1982).    In this  case, an  estate surplus  is\n\nneither suggested by the Debtor nor by the record, as the chapter\n\n7  estate was hopelessly insolvent.5   Third, Debtor submitted no\n\nbid.  Rather, Mark Bell, Debtor's president and sole shareholder,\n\nsubmitted a private offer  in his own name; the chapter 7 trustee\n                                          \n\n                    \n\n     5For  example,  the trustee  represented  in  the notice  of\nproposed private sale that  the estate had \"no funds\"  with which\nto pursue the cause of action against Reid.\n\n                                7\n\ndesignated  Bell as the offeror in his notice of proposed private\n\nsale (\"to Mark Bell  or his nominee\") (emphasis added),  and Bell\n                           \n\nsubmitted a sealed bid  in his personal capacity (\"sealed  bid of\n\nMark Bell\").  See also supra note 2.  \n                            \n\n          In sum, Debtor failed  to preserve any cognizable claim\n\nof injury resulting from the order approving the sale.   Thus, we\n\nneed not, indeed should not, address the idiosyncrasies attending\n\nsection  363(m)  \"mootness\" and  the  scope  of  the \"bad  faith\"\n\ndefense.\n\n          Appeal dismissed; no costs to either party.\n                                                    \n\n                                8\n",

An involuntary chapter 7 petition\n          CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                            \n\nwas filed against Mark  Bell Furniture Warehouse, Inc. (\"Debtor\")\n\nin 1988.   The property of  the chapter 7 estate  included a pre-\n\npetition cause of  action against D. M. Reid Associates (\"Reid\").\n\nMark  Bell (\"Bell\"),  Debtor's  president and  sole  shareholder,\n\nurged the chapter 7  trustee to litigate the claim  against Reid.\n\nWhen  the trustee  failed to  pursue the  claim, Bell  offered to\n\npurchase  the cause  of action  from the  estate for  $250.   The\n\nnotice of the proposed private sale to Bell invited upset bids in\n\nexcess of $500, subject to the condition that qualifying  bidders\n\nwould be asked to submit competing sealed  bids at auction.  Reid\n\nsubmitted an upset bid in the amount of $501.\n\n          At the  auction sale  conducted  before the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt on March 9, 1992, Bell submitted a sealed bid for $1000 and\n\nReid  bid \"$1000 plus the amount of [Bell's bid].\"  Although both\n\nthe  trustee and the bankruptcy  judge voiced concerns  as to the\n\npropriety  of Reid's  \"relative\" bid,  neither Bell  nor Debtor's\n\ncounsel objected.  The trustee accepted Reid's $2000 bid.  Debtor\n\ndid  not seek to stay the sale.   Three days later, Reid tendered\n\n$2000 to the trustee, and the trustee delivered a bill of sale.\n\n          Debtor appealed  to the district court, contending that\n\nReid's  relative bid should be declared void and that the trustee\n\nshould  be directed  to accept  Bell's lower  bid.   The district\n\n                                2\n\ncourt  dismissed the appeal as moot, based on Debtor's failure to\n\nobtain a stay of the sale pending appeal.1\n\n          Absent a stay pending  appeal, Bankruptcy Code   363(m)\n\nprecludes appellate relief  invalidating a sale to a \"good faith\"\n\npurchaser.

After the sealed bids were opened,\n\nthe  bankruptcy  judge and  the  trustee engaged  in  an extended\n\ndiscussion  as   to  the  appropriateness  of  relative  bidding.\n\nAlthough  both Bell  and Debtor's  counsel were  present, neither\n\nchallenged the  propriety of  the bid  or the  bidding.   Nor did\n\nDebtor request a stay.   In sum, at no time did  the Debtor alert\n\nthe bankruptcy  court to the  \"unfairness\" claim later  raised in\n\nits appeal to the district court.4\n\n                    \n\n     4At oral argument, Debtor disclaimed any contention whatever\nthat relative bidding, per se, violates public policy, or that it\n                             \ncontravenes  the  policy  favoring  maximization  of  liquidation\nrecoveries in  bankruptcy proceedings.   Debtor's retreat  to its\n\"unfair surprise\" claim completely undermined its earlier conten-\ntion that Reid's relative bid  was void ab initio.  See  Short v.\n                                                              \nSun Newspapers, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2055963\"><a href=\"/opinion/2055963/short-v-sun-newspapers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (Minn. 1980).  Accordingly,\n                    \nDebtor's  remaining claim    that Bell  was unfairly surprised by\nReid's  relative bid    might  portend, at most,  that Reid's bid\nwas voidable upon timely objection by an unsuccessful bidder.\n            \n\n                                5\n\n          Appellate claim preclusion is especially appropriate in\n\nthese circumstances,  where a  timely objection before  the bank-\n\nruptcy court  might well have  enabled the  prompt submission  of\n\nnonrelative  bids by  the assembled  participants.   At  the very\n   \n\nleast, it  would  have permitted  the  bankruptcy court  to  make\n\nfindings of  fact and conclusions  of law as to  whether any cog-\n\nnizable unfairness occurred in this case.

P.  2010\n                                        \n\n(authorizing proceeding on trustee's bond for breach of condition\n\nof \"faithful  performance of  official duties\").   Second, it  is\n\nwell established that a chapter  7 debtor generally lacks \"stand-\n\ning\" to  challenge a bankruptcy court judgment  confirming a sale\n\nof property of the chapter 7 estate:\n\n          A chapter 7 debtor  is not considered a \"per-\n          son aggrieved,\"  as  [it] lacks  a  pecuniary\n          interest  in  the \"property  of  the estate.\"\n          There are two exceptions:   (1) if the debtor\n          can show  that a successful appeal would gen-\n          erate  assets in excess of liabilities, enti-\n          tling the debtor to a distribution of surplus\n          under Bankruptcy Code    726(a)(6), 11 U.S.C.\n            726(a)(6), or (2)  the order appealed  from\n          affects the  terms of the  debtor's discharge\n          in bankruptcy.\n\nIn re Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584141\"><a href=\"/opinion/584141/in-re-christina-thompson-debtor-sanford-a-kowal-v-charles-m-malkemus/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1144 (1st Cir. 1992); see also In\n                                                                 \n\nre  Goodwin's  Discount  Furniture,  Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1858844\"><a href=\"/opinion/1858844/in-re-goodwins-discount-furniture-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span>  <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  887-88\n                                         \n\n(Bankr. 1st  Cir. 1982).    In this  case, an  estate surplus  is\n\nneither suggested by the Debtor nor by the record, as the chapter\n\n7  estate was hopelessly insolvent.5   Third, Debtor submitted no\n\nbid.  Rather, Mark Bell, Debtor's president and sole shareholder,\n\nsubmitted a private offer  in his own name; the chapter 7 trustee\n                                          \n\n                    \n\n     5For  example,  the trustee  represented  in  the notice  of\nproposed private sale that  the estate had \"no funds\"  with which\nto pursue the cause of action against Reid.\n\n                                7\n\ndesignated  Bell as the offeror in his notice of proposed private\n\nsale (\"to Mark Bell  or his nominee\") (emphasis added),  and Bell\n                           \n\nsubmitted a sealed bid  in his personal capacity (\"sealed  bid of\n\nMark Bell\").  See also supra note 2.  \n                            \n\n          In sum, Debtor failed  to preserve any cognizable claim\n\nof injury resulting from the order approving the sale.   Thus, we\n\nneed not, indeed should not, address the idiosyncrasies attending\n\nsection  363(m)  \"mootness\" and  the  scope  of  the \"bad  faith\"\n\ndefense.\n\n          Appeal dismissed; no costs to either party.\n                                                    \n\n                                8\n</pre>",
