Appellants, a class of Aid to Families with\n               \n\nDependent  Children recipients,  appeal the  district court's\n\nreduction of  their request for attorneys'  fees, pursuant to\n\n42 U.S.C.    1988.  We  reverse the award  and remand to  the\n\ndistrict court for further  proceedings consistent with  this\n\nopinion.\n\n                              I\n\n     Appellants brought a class action suit against appellee,\n\nCommissioner of  the Maine Department of  Human Services [the\n\nCommissioner],  seeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief\n\npursuant to  42 U.S.C.   651  et seq., 42 U.S.C.    1983, and\n                                    \n\nthe  fifth and  fourteenth  amendments to  the United  States\n\nConstitution.     Appellants  alleged  that the  Commissioner\n\nviolated  her statutory and/or  constitutional obligations in\n\nvarious  situations where  the  Commissioner collected  child\n\nsupport owed  by  a  noncustodial parent  to  more  than  one\n\nfamily.  They alleged in particular that the Commissioner (1)\n\nhad no policies or procedures to ensure that amounts of child\n\nsupport  paid by  a  noncustodial parent  were equitably  and\n\nproportionately   divided   between    families   when    the\n\nCommissioner received  less than the total  amount of support\n\ndue; (2) had  no policies  or procedures to  insure that  the\n\nchild support orders were  not inequitable in arbitrarily and\n\ncapriciously awarding disproportionate  amounts to  different\n\nfamilies;  and (3)  had failed  to follow  federally mandated\n\n                             -2-\n\nchild support review and  modification procedures.  The first\n\ntwo issues were  settled by consent decrees, entered  into by\n\nthe parties in  May 1992 and March 1993.   The consent decree\n\nalso provided  that the  final  claim would  be dismissed  by\n\nappellants without prejudice.\n\n     After approval of the  consent decree, appellants sought\n\nattorneys'  fees of $12,210.91 pursuant  to 42 U.S.C.   1988.\n\nThe  district  court found  that appellants  were \"prevailing\n\nparties\" but  reduced the amount  of the award  to $3,620.00.\n\nThe  only issue on appeal is the reasonableness of the amount\n\nawarded.  \n\n                              II\n\n     Although the district  court possesses broad  discretion\n\nin fee  setting matters,  see, e.g.,  Segal v.  Gilbert Color\n                                                             \n\nSystems, Inc., 746  F.2d 78,  86 (1st Cir.  1984), the  court\n            \n\nmust \"make  concrete  findings and  explain  its  reasoning,\"\n\nWeinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 527\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1991)  (citing cases).   This court  has long  held\n\nthat,  unless an alternative method is required by law, it is\n\nbest  to calculate  attorneys' fees  based  on the  number of\n\nhours reasonably  expended multiplied by a  reasonable hourly\n\nrate.  Id.; see also Hensley  v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 436\n                                          \n\n(1983) (approving this method for awards pursuant to   1988).\n\nOnce the court has ascertained the \"lodestar\" amount,  it may\n\nadjust this figure  as appropriate.   Segal 746  F.2d at  87.\n                                           \n\n                             -3-\n\nThis  approach  is recommended  both  because  it limits  the\n\ndanger of arbitrariness in  fee setting, Weinberger, 925 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat  526, and because it allows for \"meaningful review\" of the\n\naward by an appellate court, Furtado v. Bishop, 635 F.2d 915,\n                                              \n\n920 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n     In  the instant case, the district court did not use the\n\n\"lodestar\" approach.  Instead, the court found that $3,620.00\n\n     represents    reasonable   compensation    to   the\n\n     Plaintiffs'  counsel  in  this  case,  taking  into\n\n     account, on  balance, the difficulty  of the issues\n\n     contested, the significance of the  result obtained\n\n     in the  settlement of  the case,  and the  level of\n\n     professional  diligence  and experience  brought to\n\n     the  task  of  representing  Plaintiffs'  interests\n\n     herein by their counsel.\n\nThe court made  no findings  as to the  reasonable number  of\n\nhours  expended on the case or the reasonable hourly rate for\n\ncounsel.\n\n      Appellee asserts that the court was not required to use\n\nthe  lodestar  approach  in   this  case  because  appellants\n\nachieved only de  minimis success on their  claims.  Appellee\n                         \n\ncalls attention  to the  Supreme  Court ruling  in Farrar  v.\n                                                         \n\nHobby, 113  S.Ct. 566  (1992), which  stated that  \"'the most\n     \n\ncritical factor'  in determining the reasonableness  of a fee\n\naward  'is the degree of  the success obtained,'\"  id. at 574\n                                                     \n\n                             -4-\n\n(quoting Hensley, 461 U.S.  at 436), and that, in  some cases\n                \n\nwhere  a plaintiff  has  obtained only  minimal success,  the\n\ncourt may award low fees  without \"multiplying 'the number of\n\nhours  reasonably expended  .  .  .  by a  reasonably  hourly\n\nrate,'\" id. at 575 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433).  \n                                   \n\n     We do not find the reasoning in Farrar applicable in the\n                                           \n\ninstant  case.   Farrar  was a  damage  action in  which  the\n                       \n\nindisputably de minimis success of plaintiff was evidenced by\n                       \n\nhis having been awarded only $1 of the $17 million in damages\n\nhe sought.  See id.  The instant case,  on the other hand, is\n                  \n\nan  action for injunctive and declaratory relief in which the\n\ndegree of success is not obvious, not discussed in any detail\n\nby the district court, and very much disputed by the parties.\n\nMoreover,  the district  court  has not  made  clear how  the\n\ndegree of  success affected its  overall fee assessment.   In\n\nthese circumstances, we think  it necessary that the district\n\ncourt first  calculate the  lodestar amount, and  then, after\n\ndetermining  appellants'  degree  of  success,  see  Culebras\n                                                             \n\nEnterprises Corp. v. Rivera-Rios, 846 F.2d  94, 102 (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1988) (district court in best position to determine degree of\n\nsuccess),  adjust  the  lodestar  amount  in  light  of  that\n\ndetermination, see,  e.g., id. (no abuse  of discretion where\n                             \n\ndistrict court reduced lodestar figure by 50 percent in light\n\nof  plaintiff's lack  of  success on  claim  for damages  and\n\nlimited  success on claim for  injunctive relief).  There may\n\n                             -5-\n\nbe situations apart  from Farrar  where adequate  explanation\n                                \n\nfor  dispensing with the lodestar might excuse any attempt to\n\ncompute  the  lodestar  as  a starting  point;  but  no  such\n\nexplanation has been attempted in this case and we think that\n\nit  will be  more efficient  here for  the district  court to\n\ncompute the lodestar and then make any adjustments  it thinks\n\nwarranted.  \n\n     Appellee  also  asserts  that  the  district  court,  in\n\nreducing  appellants' request, did  not abuse  its discretion\n\nbecause  appellants  did  not  provide  a  proper  basis  for\n\ndetermining how much  time was spent on their  successful and\n\nunsuccessful claims.   The  failure to particularize time may\n\nin some  cases restrict an appellant's right  to challenge an\n\naward on appeal.   See Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581  F.2d 275, 279\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1978) (court will not view with sympathy claim that\n\ncourt awarded unreasonably low  fees where plaintiff was only\n\npartially  successful and  records do  not provide  basis for\n\ndistinguishing time spent on particular claims).  However, in\n\nthis  case, appellants  did provide  the district  court with\n\ndetailed specific documentation of  how their time was spent.\n\nMoreover, appellants' claims arguably involved a \"common core\n\nof facts\" and  were \"based on  related legal theories\"  which\n\nmade  the  division  of  time  on  a  claim  to  claim  basis\n\ndifficult.    See  Hensley,  461 U.S.  at  435.    In such  a\n                          \n\nsituation, a  reasonable fee  \"may  include compensation  for\n\n                             -6-\n\nlegal  work  performed on  the  unsuccessful  claims.\"   Id.;\n                                                           \n\nGarrity v.  Sununu, 752 F.2d 727,  734 (1st Cir.  1984).  The\n                  \n\ndetermination  of  whether  or  not  appellants'  claims were\n\n\"interrelated\" is again best made by the district court.  See\n                                                             \n\nLipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 941 (1st Cir. 1992).  \n                 \n\n     For these reasons, we vacate the award and remand to the\n\ndistrict court  for further  proceedings.  In  remanding this\n\ncase, we do not suggest that the dollar amount awarded by the\n\ndistrict  court  was  unreasonable.   We  only  require  that\n\n(absent unusual  circumstances and an  explanation) the court\n\nadhere to  the normal lodestar procedures  in calculating the\n\naward.\n\n     The award of attorneys' fees is vacated and remanded.\n                                                         \n\n                             -7-\n",

Sec. 651 et seq., 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, and the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.  Appellants alleged that the Commissioner violated her statutory and/or constitutional obligations in various situations where the Commissioner collected child support owed by a noncustodial parent to more than one family.  They alleged in particular that the Commissioner (1) had no policies or procedures to ensure that amounts of child support paid by a noncustodial parent were equitably and proportionately divided between families when the Commissioner received less than the total amount of support due;  (2) had no policies or procedures to insure that the child support orders were not inequitable in arbitrarily and capriciously awarding disproportionate amounts to different families;  and (3) had failed to follow federally mandated child support review and modification procedures.

Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 527 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing cases).  This court has long held that, unless an alternative method is required by law, it is best to calculate attorneys' fees based on the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.  Id.;  see also  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 436 (1983) (approving this method for awards pursuant to Sec. 1988).  Once the court has ascertained the \"lodestar\" amount, it may adjust this figure as appropriate.  Segal 746 F.2d at 87.  This approach is recommended both because it limits the danger of arbitrariness in fee setting,  Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 526, and because it allows for \"meaningful review\" of the award by an appellate court,  Furtado v.

Appellee calls attention to the Supreme Court ruling in  Farrar v. Hobby, 113 S.Ct. 566 (1992), which stated that \" 'the most critical factor' in determining the reasonableness of a fee award 'is the degree of the success obtained,' \"  id. at 574 (quoting  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436), and that, in some cases where a plaintiff has obtained only minimal success, the court may award low fees without \"multiplying 'the number of hours reasonably expended ... by a reasonably hourly rate,' \" id. at 575 (quoting  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find the reasoning in Farrar applicable in the instant case.

The instant case, on the other hand, is an action for injunctive and declaratory relief in which the degree of success is not obvious, not discussed in any detail by the district court, and very much disputed by the parties.  Moreover, the district court has not made clear how the degree of success affected its overall fee assessment.  In these circumstances, we think it necessary that the district court first calculate the lodestar amount, and then, after determining appellants' degree of success,  see Culebras Enterprises Corp. v. Rivera-Rios, 846 F.2d 94, 102 (1st Cir. 1988) (district court in best position to determine degree of success), adjust the lodestar amount in light of that determination, see, e.g., id.  (no abuse of discretion where district court reduced lodestar figure by 50 percent in light of plaintiff's lack of success on claim for damages and limited success on claim for injunctive relief).  There may be situations apart from Farrar where adequate explanation for dispensing with the lodestar might excuse any attempt to compute the lodestar as a starting point;  but no such explanation has been attempted in this case and we think that it will be more efficient here for the district court to compute the lodestar and then make any adjustments it thinks warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee also asserts that the district court, in reducing appellants' request, did not abuse its discretion because appellants did not provide a proper basis for determining how much time was spent on their successful and unsuccessful claims.  The failure to particularize time may in some cases restrict an appellant's right to challenge an award on appeal.   See Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 279 (1st Cir. 1978) (court will not view with sympathy claim that court awarded unreasonably low fees where plaintiff was only partially successful and records do not provide basis for distinguishing time spent on particular claims).  However, in this case, appellants did provide the district court with detailed specific documentation of how their time was spent.  Moreover, appellants' claims arguably involved a \"common core of facts\" and were \"based on related legal theories\" which made the division of time on a claim to claim basis difficult.

Sec. 1988.  We reverse the award and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Appellants brought a class action suit against appellee, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Human Services [the Commissioner], seeking declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq., 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, and the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.  Appellants alleged that the Commissioner violated her statutory and/or constitutional obligations in various situations where the Commissioner collected child support owed by a noncustodial parent to more than one family.  They alleged in particular that the Commissioner (1) had no policies or procedures to ensure that amounts of child support paid by a noncustodial parent were equitably and proportionately divided between families when the Commissioner received less than the total amount of support due;  (2) had no policies or procedures to insure that the child support orders were not inequitable in arbitrarily and capriciously awarding disproportionate amounts to different families;  and (3) had failed to follow federally mandated child support review and modification procedures.  The first two issues were settled by consent decrees, entered into by the parties in May 1992 and March 1993.  The consent decree also provided that the final claim would be dismissed by appellants without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After approval of the consent decree, appellants sought attorneys' fees of $12,210.91 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988.  The district court found that appellants were \"prevailing parties\" but reduced the amount of the award to $3,620.00.  The only issue on appeal is the reasonableness of the amount awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court possesses broad discretion in fee setting matters, see, e.g.,  Segal v. Gilbert Color Systems, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442974\"><a href=\"/opinion/442974/paul-s-segal-v-gilbert-color-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir. 1984), the court must \"make concrete findings and explain its reasoning,\" Weinberger v.  Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555766\"><a href=\"/opinion/555766/william-weinberger-v-great-northern-nekoosa-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 527 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing cases).  This court has long held that, unless an alternative method is required by law, it is best to calculate attorneys' fees based on the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.  Id.;  see also  Hensley v. Eckerhart, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 436 (1983) (approving this method for awards pursuant to Sec. 1988).  Once the court has ascertained the \"lodestar\" amount, it may adjust this figure as appropriate.  Segal 746 F.2d at 87.  This approach is recommended both because it limits the danger of arbitrariness in fee setting,  Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 526, and because it allows for \"meaningful review\" of the award by an appellate court,  Furtado v. Bishop, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384696\"><a href=\"/opinion/384696/john-furtado-v-harold-bishop/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span>, 920 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the district court did not use the \"lodestar\" approach.  Instead, the court found that $3,620.00 represents reasonable compensation to the Plaintiffs' counsel in this case, taking into account, on balance, the difficulty of the issues contested, the significance of the result obtained in the settlement of the case, and the level of professional diligence and experience brought to the task of representing Plaintiffs' interests herein by their counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court made no findings as to the reasonable number of hours expended on the case or the reasonable hourly rate for counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee asserts that the court was not required to use the lodestar approach in this case because appellants achieved only de minimis success on their claims.  Appellee calls attention to the Supreme Court ruling in  Farrar v. Hobby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span> (1992), which stated that \" 'the most critical factor' in determining the reasonableness of a fee award 'is the degree of the success obtained,' \"  id. at 574 (quoting  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436), and that, in some cases where a plaintiff has obtained only minimal success, the court may award low fees without \"multiplying 'the number of hours reasonably expended ... by a reasonably hourly rate,' \" id. at 575 (quoting  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find the reasoning in Farrar applicable in the instant case.  Farrar was a damage action in which the indisputably de minimis success of plaintiff was evidenced by his having been awarded only $1 of the $17 million in damages he sought.  See id.  The instant case, on the other hand, is an action for injunctive and declaratory relief in which the degree of success is not obvious, not discussed in any detail by the district court, and very much disputed by the parties.  Moreover, the district court has not made clear how the degree of success affected its overall fee assessment.  In these circumstances, we think it necessary that the district court first calculate the lodestar amount, and then, after determining appellants' degree of success,  see Culebras Enterprises Corp. v. Rivera-Rios, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505830\"><a href=\"/opinion/505830/culebras-enterprises-corporation-v-miguel-a-rivera-rios/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir. 1988) (district court in best position to determine degree of success), adjust the lodestar amount in light of that determination, see, e.g., id.  (no abuse of discretion where district court reduced lodestar figure by 50 percent in light of plaintiff's lack of success on claim for damages and limited success on claim for injunctive relief).  There may be situations apart from Farrar where adequate explanation for dispensing with the lodestar might excuse any attempt to compute the lodestar as a starting point;  but no such explanation has been attempted in this case and we think that it will be more efficient here for the district court to compute the lodestar and then make any adjustments it thinks warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee also asserts that the district court, in reducing appellants' request, did not abuse its discretion because appellants did not provide a proper basis for determining how much time was spent on their successful and unsuccessful claims.  The failure to particularize time may in some cases restrict an appellant's right to challenge an award on appeal.   See Nadeau v. Helgemoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358671\"><a href=\"/opinion/358671/larry-nadeau-v-raymond-a-helgemoe-warden-new-hampshire-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 279 (1st Cir. 1978) (court will not view with sympathy claim that court awarded unreasonably low fees where plaintiff was only partially successful and records do not provide basis for distinguishing time spent on particular claims).  However, in this case, appellants did provide the district court with detailed specific documentation of how their time was spent.  Moreover, appellants' claims arguably involved a \"common core of facts\" and were \"based on related legal theories\" which made the division of time on a claim to claim basis difficult.  See  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435.  In such a situation, a reasonable fee \"may include compensation for legal work performed on the unsuccessful claims.\"  Id.;   Garrity v. Sununu, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446762\"><a href=\"/opinion/446762/sandra-garrity-etc-v-john-sununu-governor-of-the-state-of-new/\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 734 (1st Cir. 1984).  The determination of whether or not appellants' claims were \"interrelated\" is again best made by the district court.   See Lipsett v. Blanco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591130\"><a href=\"/opinion/591130/annabelle-lipsett-v-gumersindo-blanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span>, 941 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we vacate the award and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
