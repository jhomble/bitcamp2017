Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Andrew D. Epstein, with whom Lucy Lovrien was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Scott P. Lewis, with whom Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge LLP\nwas on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           August 22, 2006\n\f           LIPEZ,     Circuit   Judge.     This   case    raises       important\n\nquestions about the application of the Visual Artists Rights Act of\n\n1990 (\"VARA\"), 17 U.S.C. § 106A, to \"site-specific art\", which is\n\na subset of \"integrated art\".            A work of \"integrated art\" is\n\ncomprised of two or more physical objects that must be presented\n\ntogether as the artist intended for the work to retain its meaning\n\nand integrity.        In a work of \"site-specific art\", one of the\n\ncomponent physical objects is the location of the art.                 To remove\n\na work of site-specific art from its original site is to destroy\n\nit.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           David Phillips brought suit against Pembroke Real Estate,\n\nInc. in federal district court, asserting that the removal of any\n\nor all of his work, consisting of multiple pieces of sculpture and\n\nstonework, from Eastport Park in South Boston would violate his\n\nstatutory rights under VARA and the Massachusetts Art Preservation\n\nAct (\"MAPA\"), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85S.            The district court\n\nruled   that   VARA   recognized   integrated     art,   and    that    most   of\n\nPhillips' sculptures and stonework in the Park constituted \"one\n\nintegrated 'work of visual art'\" -- with the remaining pieces being\n\n\"individual    free-standing    pieces    of   sculpture,      which    are    not\n\nintegrated into the other pieces.\"          It also held that Phillips'\n\nintegrated work of art was an example of site-specific art.                    But\n\nthe court held that Pembroke could remove Phillips' works from the\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fPark pursuant to VARA's so-called \"public presentation\" exception.\n\nSee 17 U.S.C. § 106A(c)(2).\n\n            Phillips   challenges    that    reading     of   the   public\n\npresentation exception on appeal.         Although we disagree with the\n\ndistrict court's reasoning (we hold that VARA does not apply to\n\nsite-specific art at all), we affirm the decision of the district\n\ncourt permitting Pembroke to remove Phillips' works from the Park.\n\n                                    II.\n\nA.   The artist\n\n            Phillips is a nationally recognized sculptor who works\n\nprimarily with stone and bronze forms that he integrates into local\n\nenvirons.    In many of his sculptures, the design of the stones is\n\nincorporated into the landscape -- such as a private project in\n\nOgunquit, Maine, where a band of rock was extended into a bronze\n\ntributary in the ground, which, in sunlight, glistened like a\n\nnearby stream.    In some of his other works, Phillips has merged\n\nmetals or polished stone with aged, naturally-shaped boulders.\n\n            Phillips' commissioned work from the past twenty years\n\ncan be found at private companies and universities and in public\n\nspaces across the United States -- in places such as Massachusetts,\n\nWashington, D.C., New York, and Utah -- and internationally -- in\n\nplaces such as Tokyo, Japan and Colombia.              His work has been\n\nprofiled in both Japanese and American art magazines, and featured\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fin galleries and museums in, among many places, New York City and\n\nMaine.   His 1993 promotional brochure details his artistic themes:\n\n     It is Phillips' inherent reverence for natural beauty in\n     this ecologically ravaged world that influences all his\n     decisions, particularly when he recontextualizes a stone\n     by replacing part of its form with a man-made surrogate\n     or when he gracefully applies typical landscaping and\n     architectural materials along with natural stone and\n     traditional art materials into new equations of form and\n     function.\n\n\nB.   The Park\n\n           Eastport Park (the \"Park\"), which was completed in its\n\ncurrent form in the spring of 2000, is located across from Boston\n\nHarbor in the South Boston Waterfront District.         The Park is\n\nroughly rectangular in shape.    Its borders are formed by the World\n\nTrade Center East Office building to the west, D Street to the\n\neast, Seaport Boulevard to the north, and New Congress Street to\n\nthe south.      The Park is a public sculpture park with a nautical\n\ntheme.\n\n           In addition to Phillips, three other artists also crafted\n\nart located in the Park.     Japanese sculptor Susumu Shingu created\n\ntall kinetic sculptures, Judy McKie contributed bronze, fish-shaped\n\nbenches, and landscape architect Craig Halvorson designed a pergola\n\n(a shady resting place, made of rustic work or latticework on which\n\nplants, such as climbing shrubs or vines, are grown).      The Park\n\nalso contains paths that are inlaid with granite paving stones,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\flarge   granite    boulders,    and    flora       meant    to   evoke   an   aquatic\n\nenvironment.\n\n            Defendant Pembroke Real Estate, Inc. (\"Pembroke\"), a\n\nFidelity Investments company, leases the land on which the Park is\n\nbuilt from the Massachusetts Port Authority (\"Massport\"). Massport\n\nand the Boston Redevelopment Authority must approve any changes to\n\nthe design of the Park.         The Park is required to be open to the\n\npublic, free of charge, twenty-four hours a day.\n\nC.   Phillips' work in the Park\n\n            In 1999, Pembroke commissioned Phillips to work on the\n\nPark in conjunction with the development of the World Trade Center\n\nEast    office    building   that     forms    the     Park's      western    border.\n\nPhillips worked closely with Halvorson on the design of the Park.\n\nIn fact, he had an oral agreement with Halvorson to act as the\n\nartist who worked with the landscape specialists.                    As part of his\n\nwork with Halvorson, Phillips aided in the design of a series of\n\nrepeated spirals that run along the axis of the Park from the\n\nnortheast to the southwest corner.\n\n            To establish the terms of the commission, Phillips and\n\nPembroke   executed    two     contracts      in    August       1999.    Under   the\n\n\"Eastport Park Artwork Agreement\", Phillips created approximately\n\ntwenty-seven      sculptures    for    the     Park,       comprised     of   fifteen\n\nabstract bronze and granite pieces and twelve realistic bronze\n\nsculptures of various aquatic creatures, including frogs, crabs,\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fand   shrimp.    Under      the   \"Eastport       Park   Stonework     Agreement\",\n\nPhillips was responsible for the design and installation of stone\n\nwalls, granite stones inlaid into the Park's walkways, and other\n\nlandscape design elements.         Most of Phillips' work in the Park is\n\norganized along the diagonal axis running from the northeast to the\n\nsouthwest corner, at the center of which is his large spherical\n\nsculpture entitled \"Chords\", the centerpiece of the Park, which\n\nPhillips personally carved from granite.\n\n            Phillips designed a bronze medallion with Zodiac signs,\n\nwhich crowns an S-shaped circular granite path, also of Phillips'\n\ndesign; outlying sculptures off of the main axis (many bronze\n\ncrabs, frogs, and shrimp and a large seashell); and the curve\n\nmotifs. He worked with a stone mason to choose and place the rough\n\nlichen-covered, Maine-quarried stone, and he selected the large\n\ngranite stones that he used as part of his sculptures to mirror the\n\nlarge granite stones along Boston Harbor.                Phillips' work in the\n\nPark is unified by a theme of spiral and circular forms.\n\nD.    Pembroke's redesign of the Park and the preliminary injunction\n\n            In 2001, Pembroke decided to alter the Park. It retained\n\nElizabeth    Banks,    a    British   landscape      artist,    to   conduct     the\n\nredesign.    Konstantine Krekis, a member of the original design\n\nteam, also contributed to the redesign.             Believing that the Park's\n\noriginal    design    had     conceptual     problems,      Pembroke    wanted    to\n\nsimplify    walkways    and    include     more    plants    for   better   shade.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fPembroke also wanted to remove much of the original stone, which\n\nhad caused maintenance problems.\n\n            Banks'   redesign          plan    called   for     the   removal    and\n\nrelocation of Phillips' sculptures.                  Phillips protested.          In\n\nJanuary 2003, Pembroke agreed to retain Phillips' rough stone walls\n\nand all but one of his sculptures.                The new redesign plan would\n\nalso   relocate   some     of    the    granite   paving      and   change   several\n\nwalkways and finished granite objects.               Objecting to this revised\n\nplan, Phillips filed suit in federal district court, seeking\n\ninjunctive relief under VARA and MAPA.\n\n            On August 21, 2003, following a nonevidentiary hearing,\n\nthe district court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining\n\nPembroke from altering the Park.              Subsequently, Pembroke declared\n\nits return to the original redesign plan, which would remove nearly\n\nall of Phillips' work from the Park.              After a two-day evidentiary\n\nhearing, the district court issued a memorandum and order in which\n\nit found that Phillips had established the likelihood of showing:\n\n(1) that most, but not all, of his work in the Park constituted\n\n\"one 'integrated work of visual art,'\" see Phillips v. Pembroke\n\nReal   Estate,    Inc.,    288    F.    Supp.   2d   89,   98   (D.   Mass.     2003)\n\n(hereinafter \"Phillips I\"); (2) \"an artist has no right to the\n\nplacement   or    public    presentation        of   his   sculpture    under    the\n\nexception in § 106A(c)(2),\" VARA's public presentation exception (a\n\nfinding that applied to Phillips' work as both integrated art and\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fsite-specific    art),    id.   at   100;   and    (3)   that    because   \"the\n\nenvironment of Phillips' integrated sculpture along the axis of the\n\nPark is a critical element of those works, [] changing the location\n\nof the sculpture constitutes an [impermissible] alteration under\"\n\nMAPA, id. at 102.        Therefore, according to the district court,\n\nPembroke could move Phillips' work from the Park consistent with\n\nVARA, so long as Pembroke did not \"alter, modify or destroy the\n\n'works of visual art' as [the court] [had] defined them.\"              Id. at\n\n100. In other words, consistent with VARA, Phillips' free-standing\n\nworks could be moved; and the multi-element, integrated work of art\n\nalong the northeast-southwest axis could be disassembled and moved\n\npiecemeal, so long as individual pieces comprising this integrated\n\nwork of art were not altered, modified, or destroyed.                However,\n\nunder the broader protections of MAPA for site-specific art, the\n\ncourt granted a preliminary injunction preventing Pembroke from\n\naltering the Park.\n\nE.   Subsequent procedural history\n\n           Both parties filed interlocutory appeals to this court\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).            In the interim, the district\n\ncourt certified the question of whether MAPA protected Phillips'\n\nwork in the Park to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\n\n(\"SJC\"), and the federal appeals were stayed pending the SJC's\n\nresolution of this state law question.            See Phillips v. Pembroke\n\nReal   Estate,   Inc.,   819    N.E.2d   579    (Mass.   2004)   (hereinafter\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f\"Phillips II\").   The specific question certified to the SJC was:\n\n\"to what extent does the Massachusetts Art Preservation Act, Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 231, § 85S (1984), protect the placement of 'site\n\nspecific' art?\"   Id. at 580.\n\n          The SJC concluded that MAPA did not protect site-specific\n\nart.   See id. at 585-86.   In particular, the SJC highlighted the\n\nfollowing: (1) \"Phillips's contention that the site can be the\n\n'medium' of such art [wa]s not consistent with [] dictionary\n\ndefinitions [of the statutory term 'medium'],\" id. at 584; (2) \"the\n\nLegislature was concerned not only with creating new rights for\n\nartists, but also with protecting the rights of property owners who\n\ncommission artworks that become attached to real property,\" id.;\n\nand (3) \"[i]f the Legislature intended to include the type of\n\nsite-specific art at issue here within MAPA's protections, it would\n\nentail a radical consequence for owners of land,\" id.\n\n          In light of the SJC's ruling and its own prior conclusion\n\nthat it was possible for Phillips' sculptures to be removed from\n\nthe Park consistent with VARA because of VARA's public presentation\n\nexception, the district court vacated the preliminary injunction it\n\nhad granted and entered judgment on all counts. On appeal, neither\n\nparty disputes the district court's finding that Phillips' work in\n\nthe Park along the northeast-southwest axis is both integrated and\n\nsite-specific art.   Additionally, neither party contests the fact\n\nthat moving any or all of this integrated work from the Park would\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fconstitute a physical alteration of the work.     Phillips, for his\n\npart, does not claim on appeal that VARA prohibits the removal of\n\nintegrated art that is not site-specific.1   Instead, he claims that\n\nVARA prohibits the removal of site-specific art.      Therefore, he\n\nchallenges only the district court's conclusion that the public\n\npresentation exception of VARA permits Pembroke to remove from the\n\nPark his large, multi-element work of art, which the district court\n\nfound was both integrated and site-specific.2\n\n                               III.\n\nA.   Statutory Background\n\n           VARA states in relevant part that the \"author of a work\n\nof visual art\":\n\n     (3) subject to the limitations set forth in section\n     113(d), shall have the right -\n\n     (A) to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or\n     other modification of that work which would be\n     prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation, and any\n     intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of\n     that work is a violation of that right, and\n\n     (B) to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized\n     stature, and any intentional or grossly negligent\n     destruction of that work is a violation of that right.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       To be clear, we are not saying that, in fact, Phillips does\nnot believe that VARA prohibits the removal of integrated art that\nis not site-specific. We are simply saying that he has not raised\nthat issue on appeal.\n      2\n       Attached as an appendix is a diagram of Eastport Park that\nPhillips attached as Exhibit D to his \"Supplemental Memorandum in\nSupport of His Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\".\n\n                               -10-\n\f17 U.S.C. § 106(A)(a)(3)(A) and (B). As an exception, § 106A(c)(2)\n\nstates that:\n\n     The modification of a work of visual art which is the\n     result of conservation, or of the public presentation,\n     including lighting and placement, of the work is not a\n     destruction,    distortion,   mutilation,   or   other\n     modification described in subsection (a)(3) unless the\n     modification is caused by gross negligence.\n\nThis is the public presentation exception.   A \"work of visual art\"\n\nis defined as including \"a painting, drawing, print or sculpture,\n\nexisting in a single copy\" or in a limited edition.       17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 101.\n\n          In Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc., 71 F.3d 77 (2d Cir.\n\n1995), the Second Circuit, citing VARA's legislative history,\n\nexplained that VARA:\n\n     protects both the reputations of certain visual artists\n     and the works of art they create.      It provides these\n     artists with the rights of \"attribution\" and \"integrity\"\n     . . . . These rights are analogous to those protected by\n     Article 6 bis of the Berne Convention, which are commonly\n     known as \"moral rights.\" The theory of moral rights is\n     that they result in a climate of artistic worth and honor\n     that encourages the author in the arduous act of\n     creation.\n\nId. at 83 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 101-514, at 5, reprinted in 1990\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 6915, 6917).3   \"VARA grants three rights: the right of\n\n\n     3\n       The Berne Convention is \"an international copyright treaty\nproviding that works created by citizens of one signatory nation\nwill be fully protected in other signatory nations, without the\nneed for local formalities.

Site-specific art\n\n            During   the   preliminary   injunction   hearing,   one   of\n\nPhillips' experts, Daniel Ranalli, a professor of art history at\n\nBoston University, stated:\n\n      Beginning at least with the last third of the 20th\n      century, and continuing through the present, the notion\n      of sculpture has undergone a radical redefinition. In\n      essence, sculpture has come off [of] its pedestal,\n      functioning in the space in and around its site, and\n      playing an integral role in defining that space.\n\nPhillips I, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 95.          According to the district\n\ncourt's summary, another of Phillips' experts, Richard Barreto,\n\nExecutive Director of the Urban Arts Institute of the Massachusetts\n\nCollege of Art, who is involved in the selection of artists to\n\ncreate art in public spaces, testified that:\n\n      [T]oday the concept of \"site specificity\" is the\n      \"rallying cry\" of public artists who seek to create a\n      piece that derives enhanced meaning from its environment.\n      Much of modern sculpture does not exist separate from its\n      context, but rather integrates its context with the work\n      to form, ideally, a seamless whole.\n\nId.    Essentially, for site-specific art, the location of the work\n\nis an integral element of the work.       Because the location of the\n\nwork contributes to its meaning, site-specific art is destroyed if\n\nit is moved from its original site.

Pol'y 203, 211 (2001) (\"It is clear that the\n\ncommunity of respected American artists and art authorities regard\n\nthe crafted work and the site of site-specific artworks as an\n\nindivisible whole. The artists who create these works explain that\n\nthe meaning and purpose behind the art lie squarely within its\n\nphysical location.\")\n\n           As   Halvorson     stated   in    an   affidavit,   \"[t]his   view\n\ncontrasts with so-called 'plop-art' where a separately conceived\n\nart object is simply placed in a space.\"          Phillips I, 288 F. Supp.\n\n2d   at   95.   A    piece   of   plop-art    does   not   incorporate   its\n\nsurroundings.       Site-specific art is the opposite of plop-art.        In\n\nsummary, as the district court found below, \"[t]he undisputed\n\nexpert testimony is that in site-specific sculpture, the artist\n\nincorporates the environment as one of the media with which he\n\nworks.\"   Id.\n\nC.   The district court's opinion\n\n           We must examine closely the arguments that Phillips\n\npresented to the district court, and the district court's responses\n\nto those arguments, for two reasons.          First, both the statute and\n\nthe underlying concepts (integrated art and site-specific art) are\n\nsomewhat complex.       Second, the parties could not even agree about\n\nthe issue on appeal.      We must get these basics sorted out before we\n\ncan analyze the competing arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f            1.   Phillips' arguments to the district court\n\n            Before the district court, Phillips sought to prevent\n\nPembroke from altering, moving, or modifying any of his work in the\n\nPark in any way.      At this time in the chronology of the case, the\n\ndistrict court had not yet made its factual finding that Phillips'\n\nsculpture     and   stonework   along     the    northeast-southwest   axis\n\ncomprised a single work of integrated art.             Therefore, Phillips\n\nfirst argued that \"his sculptures and the related stonework are\n\nworks of visual art designed specifically for Eastport Park and\n\nthey reflect and enhance the Park's location adjacent to Boston\n\nHarbor and are inseparable from it.\"            In other words, each of his\n\nworks was site-specific, i.e., each individual piece was integrated\n\nwith its location in the Park.          Phillips also argued that VARA\n\nprotected each of these works from any change in location because\n\nsuch a change would impermissibly alter them. Under this argument,\n\nall of his pieces -- be it any one of his sculptures, or one of the\n\nStone Elements -- \"are meaningful only if they remain in Eastport\n\nPark, the location for which they were created.\"               As Phillips\n\nelaborated:\n\n     if any sculptures are moved or removed, the spirit,\n     integrity and character of [the] installations will be\n     destroyed . . . . [because] the meaning and purpose of\n     the art derives in large part from its physical locations\n     . . . .    [E]ven if the sculptures and stonework are\n     rebuilt elsewhere someday, the artwork will never be the\n     same as [I] intended it to be, and as it currently\n     exists.\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fAs a corollary to this \"site-specific, individual work\" argument,\n\nPhillips also argued that \"[r]emoval of [his] site-specific work\n\nwould not be a permitted 'presentation' or 'placement of the work\n\nunder the section 106A(c)(2) exception,\" i.e., that Pembroke's\n\nproposed removal of some or all of his work from the Park did not\n\nfall within VARA's public presentation exception, which permits\n\ncertain categories of alterations to works of art.4\n\n          As alternatives, Phillips asserted two integrated work of\n\nart arguments in addition to his site-specific, individual work of\n\nart argument.    First, he contended that the \"Park contains a\n\nsufficient number of interrelated works of visual art created by\n\nPhillips, so that any modification of any of the interrelated Parts\n\nof the Park will have an impact on the other related works, and\n\ntherefore will be a violation of VARA.\"   In other words, apart from\n\nany claim that each of the individual sculptures was site-specific,\n\nPhillips claimed that each of his individual pieces in the Park was\n\nan element of a single, larger, multi-element work of integrated\n\nart such that the removal or modification of any one of these\n\nelements in the Park would harm the larger, integrated work and\n\nviolate VARA.\n\n          As a second integrated work of art argument, Phillips\n\nargued that while \"this court may not have to determine that the\n\n\n\n     4\n       As noted, this \"corollary\" argument becomes Phillips' sole\nargument on appeal.\n\n                               -16-\n\fPark as a whole is a work of visual art protected by VARA,\" \"[i]f\n\n[keeping all of my work in the Park] means that Eastport Park must\n\nbe declared to be an inviolate work of art [as a whole], then so be\n\nit.\"   In other words, Phillips argued that, if necessary, he would\n\nassert that the Park as a whole, including the work of the other\n\nartists, was a single work of integrated art.\n\n               2.   Integrated art\n\n               The district court addressed the integrated art question\n\nfirst:\n\n       The first question is whether Phillips' twenty-seven (27)\n       sculptures constitute a single work of visual art or\n       instead are discrete works of art that must be treated\n       separately under VARA. A related issue is whether the\n       Park as a whole should be treated as a work of visual\n       art.\n\n       . . .\n\n       Phillips takes the position that his artwork extends\n       beyond the[] individual sculptures and includes the\n       finished and rough-hewn granite and stone pavings and the\n       stone walls that he designed and placed, including the\n       \"Chords\" path and the medallion path (the \"Stone\n       Elements\"). He also contends that all of his sculptures\n       form one integrated, interrelated work of visual art. To\n       place the sculptural elements in different alignments\n       relative to one another . . . would destroy sight lines\n       and alter the deliberately-crafted spatial relationships\n       among the paths, granite walls, and individual pieces of\n       sculpture.\n\nPhillips I, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 97-98.\n\n               The district court had to decide whether the phrase \"work\n\nof visual art\", as used in VARA, encompassed the concept of\n\nintegrated art.         The district court first looked to the few\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fexisting cases addressing VARA.      The court found that \"courts have\n\nheld that works composed of a variety of pieces and in a variety of\n\nmedia may still constitute one work of 'visual art' under VARA.\"\n\nId. at 98 (citing Carter, 71 F.3d at 83-84; English v. BFC & R E.\n\n11th St. LLC, No. 97-7446, 1997 WL 746444, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 1997);\n\nand Pavia v. 1120 Ave. of the Americas Assoc., 901 F.Supp. 620,\n\n627-28   (S.D.N.Y.   1995)).   The   district   court   next   looked   to\n\nlegislative history, particularly a statement instructing courts\n\nto:\n\n      use common sense and generally accepted standards of the\n      artistic community in determining whether a particular\n      work falls within the scope of the definition [of \"work\n      of visual art\"]. Artists may work in a variety of media,\n      and use any number of materials in creating their works.\n      Therefore, whether a particular work falls within the\n      definition should not depend on the medium or materials\n      used.\n\nId. at 98-99 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 101-514, at 6).        Based on the\n\ncase law and legislative history, the district court found that\n\nVARA embraced the concept of integrated art: \"Despite [Congress']\n\nnarrow definition, courts have held that works composed of a\n\nvariety of pieces and in a variety of media may still constitute\n\none work of 'visual art' under VARA.\"      Id. at 98.\n\n           What remained was a question of fact: whether all of\n\nPhillips' work in the Park constituted a single work of visual art?\n\nThe district court found that:\n\n      the sculptures along the northwest to southeast axis of\n      the Park, including \"Chords\" and the medallion sculpture,\n      as well as the Stone Elements, are one integrated \"work\n\n                                 -18-\n\f     of visual art.\" It begins with a spiral in the northwest\n     corner along Seaport Boulevard, includes Plaintiff's\n     \"Chords\" sculpture, and continues along a spiral path of\n     mosaic paving stone, culminating in the bronze medallion.\n     In determining that the sculptures along this axis, as\n     well as the related Stone Elements, are one work of\n     visual art, the Court relies on the integrated marine\n     theme and recurring spirals, as well as the use of marine\n     granite boulders and pavers. However, the remainder of\n     the sculptures . . . that do not lie along the axis are\n     not part of the same work of visual art. While these\n     sculptures share the marine theme, the Court finds these\n     pieces are individual free-standing pieces of sculpture,\n     which are not integrated into the other pieces by spirals\n     or granite.\n\nId. at 98.5   In other words, the district court concluded that most\n\nof Phillips' pieces in the Park constituted a single work of\n\nintegrated art, but it rejected his position that all of his pieces\n\ncomprised a single work of art.\n\n          The district court then addressed Phillips' argument that\n\nthe Park itself is an integrated work of art:\n\n     [o]ne novel issue is whether a park can be a \"work of\n     visual art\" under VARA.      Phillips contends that the\n     Eastport Park as a whole is one large integrated piece of\n     \"sculpture.\"\n\n     The Court rejects Plaintiff's argument that the Park as\n     a whole is a work of visual art. As [] Barreto conceded,\n     a park does not fit within the traditional definition of\n     sculpture . . . . Conceivably, a sculptor could design\n     a sculpture garden that includes multiple inter-related\n     sculptural elements that form an integrated work of\n     visual art . . . . However, here, many elements in the\n     Park were not created by Phillips . . . . Substantial\n\n\n     5\n        The district court mistakenly refers to the works along the\n\"northwest-southeast\" axis of the Park, Phillips I, 288 F. Supp. 2d\nat 93, 98.     The correct compass directions are northeast and\nsouthwest, as found later in the district court's order. See id.\nat 105.\n\n                                -19-\n\f      areas of the Park are unrelated to Phillips' sculpture\n      and not integrated with it . . . .        While Phillips\n      certainly assisted in designing the stone elements in the\n      paths and walls and in placing his own sculptures, the\n      Park as a whole is not an integrated work of art.\n\nId. at 98-99 (internal citation omitted).         In deciding whether the\n\nPark was an integrated work of art, the district court left open\n\nthe legal question of whether a park could ever be a \"work of\n\nvisual art\" as defined by VARA.      Instead, it held that, assuming a\n\npark could be a work of integrated art recognized by VARA, the Park\n\nwas not such a work.\n\n            Finally,   the   district   court's     conclusion    that   VARA\n\napplied to integrated art, and its related conclusion that Phillips\n\nhad created a work of integrated art in the Park, did not prevent\n\nthe removal of Phillips' works from the Park.         That was so because\n\nthe district court also concluded that integrated art was subject\n\nto   the   public   presentation   exception   of    VARA,   §   106A(c)(2).\n\nPhillips' integrated work of art could still be disassembled and\n\nmoved so long as the \"works of visual art\" are not \"alter[ed],\n\nmodif[ied], or destroy[ed].\"       Id. at 100.6\n\n\n\n\n      6\n       As we explain further, this ruling about the application of\nVARA to integrated art, exclusive of site-specific art, is not\nchallenged on appeal. It is a fact that art museums are filled\nwith works of art comprised of multiple pieces. These works often\ntravel from museum to museum. Their disassembly and reassembly for\nthe purpose of relocation at another museum does not create VARA\nliability.\n\n                                   -20-\n\f          3.   Site-specific art\n\n          There remained Phillips' site-specificity argument.    If\n\nPhillips could show that: (1) his work in the Park was site-\n\nspecific art; (2) VARA protected site-specific art; and (3) that\n\nthe public presentation exception did not apply to site-specific\n\nart, none of his work could be moved, even on a piecemeal basis.\n\n          Phillips convinced the district court that most of his\n\nwork in the Park was site-specific as well as integrated.         In\n\ndiscussing the issue of site-specificity as part of its discussion\n\nof MAPA, the district court made the following factual finding:\n\n     I find that Phillips' sculpture has a marine theme that\n     integrates the large granite stones of the park with his\n     sculpture and the granite sea walls of Boston Harbor into\n     one interrelated visual work of art. Therefore, Phillips\n     used the harborside location at Eastport Park as one\n     medium of his art. To move Phillips' integrated work of\n     visual art (i.e., the sculptures, boulders, and granite\n     paths along the axis, which I described in the VARA\n     discussion) to another location (particularly a non-\n     marine one) would be to alter it physically.\n\nPhillips I, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 102.7\n\n          Having made this finding on the site-specific nature of\n\nPhillips' work, the district court explained the positions of\n\nPhillips and Pembroke on site-specificity:\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       The district court's factual finding that the works along\nthe northeast-southwest axis constituted a single work of\nintegrated art, and that this integrated work was also site-\nspecific, may explain why, on appeal, Phillips abandons his\nargument that his sculptures and stonework, on an individual basis,\nincluding the now free-standing ones, are site-specific.\n\n                               -21-\n\f     [Phillips] [] argues that his work is so site-specific\n     that moving it would be an intentional destruction or\n     modification under VARA. Taking the sculpture from its\n     current location and locating it on a private campus in\n     Rhode Island not near the ocean . . . would be like\n     painting over the background landscape in the Mona Lisa.\n\n     [Pembroke] contends that the \"public presentation\"\n     exclusion in § 106A(c)(2) permits it to move plaintiff's\n     sculptures from their current placement to another, just\n     as the statute would not prevent a curator from moving\n     the Mona Lisa from one wall in the Louvre to another.\n\n     Section 106A(c)(2) has been interpreted to exclude from\n     VARA's protection \"site-specific\" works, works that would\n     be modified if they were moved.\n\nId. at 99 (citation omitted).   The district court then referenced\n\none of the few relevant cases, see Bd. of Managers of Soho Int'l\n\nArts Condo. v. City of New York, No. 01-1226, 2003 WL 21403333, at\n\n*10 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (stating that VARA's objective \"is not . . . to\n\npreserve a work of visual art where it is, but rather to preserve\n\nthe work as it is\") (hereinafter \"Soho I\"); Bd. of Managers of Soho\n\nInt'l Arts Condo. v. City of New York, No. 01-1226, 2003 WL\n\n21767653, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (hereinafter \"Soho II\").   It then\n\nfound Pembroke's legal argument \"more persuasive because it is\n\nrooted in the plain language of the exclusion in § 106A(c)(2) as\n\nwell as the statute's legislative history.\"    Phillips I, 288 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 100; see also id. (\"'Generally, the removal of a work\n\nfrom a specific location comes within the [presentation] exclusion\n\nbecause the location is a matter of presentation.'\") (quoting H.R.\n\nRep. No. 101-514, at 12).\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f            Finally, the district court highlighted the fact that the\n\npublic    presentation   exception      \"was   crafted   after    the   widely-\n\npublicized dispute between the General Services Administration and\n\nthe   artist   Richard   Serra   over    the   removal   of   Serra's    'site-\n\nspecific' piece 'Tilted Arc.'\" Id.; see also Serra v. United States\n\nGen. Serv. Admin., 847 F.2d 1045 (2d Cir. 1988).                 In Serra, the\n\nSecond Circuit rejected the plaintiff's argument that the removal\n\nof an integrated, site-specific, government-owned work of art from\n\nfederal property violated the free expression and due process\n\nrights of the artist.     See Serra, 847 F.2d at 1045.            The district\n\ncourt inferred that because VARA and the public presentation\n\nexception were adopted after Serra, Congress must have been aware\n\nof site-specific art.     Yet VARA says nothing that suggests special\n\nprotection for site-specific art.           Therefore, the district court\n\nconcluded that:\n\n      an artist has no right to the placement or public\n      presentation of his sculpture under the exception in\n      § 106A(c)(2). [Pembroke] is not obligated to display the\n      works in the Park, as VARA provides no protection for a\n      change in placement or presentation.     However, under\n      VARA, [Pembroke] is under an obligation not to alter,\n      modify or destroy the \"works of visual art\" as I have\n      defined them.\n\nId. at 100.8\n\n\n      8\n      When the district court refers to the obligation of Pembroke\nnot \"to alter, modify, or destroy the 'works of visual art' as I\nhave defined them,\" it means that the individual pieces of\nsculpture, and the Stone Elements, that comprise the integrated\nwork of art must not be altered, modified, or destroyed.\nOtherwise, the disassembled work of integrated art could not be\n\n                                     -23-\n\f           This      is   the   conclusion    that    Phillips       challenges   on\n\nappeal.    As he puts it: \"the District Court misinterpreted the\n\nlanguage   and    Legislative      history    of    the    [public    presentation\n\nexception], and [] VARA protects Phillips' artwork from the removal\n\nplanned by Pembroke.\"            Pembroke asserts, inter alia, that the\n\ndistrict   court      ruled     correctly    that    the   public     presentation\n\nexception negates any protection VARA extends to site-specific art.\n\nMore fundamentally, it argues that VARA does not apply to site-\n\nspecific art at all.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n           Our review of the district court's decision is de novo.\n\nSee Riva v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st\n\nCir.   1995)   (\"A    district     court's   resolution      of   a    question   of\n\nstatutory interpretation engenders de novo review in the court of\n\nappeals.\").      \"We are not wedded to the lower court's rationale,\n\nbut, rather, may affirm its order on any independent ground made\n\nmanifest by the record,\" InterGen N.V. v.

Sigmon Coal Co.,\n\n534 U.S. 438, 450 (2002).           Furthermore, \"[w]e have consistently\n\nheld that when the plain meaning of a statute is clear, we are not\n\nto look beyond that text to discern legislative intent.\"                  Palmieri\n\nv. Nynex Long Distance Co., 437 F.3d 111, 115 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\n\nreassembled later at another location.\n\n                                      -24-\n\fsee also Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Álvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d 275, 277\n\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1999) (When \"the plain meaning of the statute\n\nresolves the issue sub judice, we need not rummage through the\n\nlegislative history or search for other interpretive aids.\").\n\nA.   The district court's understanding of site-specific art and\n     VARA\n\n           To help explain our holding that VARA does not apply to\n\nsite-specific art, we must begin with a restatement of the district\n\ncourt's view of the interaction between VARA and site-specific art.\n\nOn the one hand, the district court accepted the concept of site-\n\nspecific art.      It credited the unopposed testimony of Ranalli,\n\nPhillips' expert, \"that for site specific art, the location of the\n\nwork is a constituent element of the work.\"                Phillips I, 288 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 95.        The district court understood that \"[u]nder this\n\napproach, because the location defines the art, site-specific\n\nsculpture is destroyed if it is moved from the site.\"                      Id.   The\n\ndistrict court also found that \"[t]o move Phillips' integrated work\n\nof visual art (i.e., the sculptures, boulders, and granite paths\n\nalong the axis . . . described in the VARA discussion) to another\n\nlocation . . . would be to alter it physically,\" id. at 102.\n\n           On    the    other    hand,    in    the   section   of   its    opinion\n\naddressing      Phillips'       site-specificity       argument      --    entitled\n\n\"'Public-Presentation' Exclusion\" -- the district court noted that\n\n\"Section 106A(c)(2) has been interpreted to exclude from VARA's\n\nprotection 'site-specific' works, works that would be modified if\n\n                                         -25-\n\fthey were moved.\"        Phillips I, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 99.         It then\n\nreferenced Soho I (\"[T]he point of VARA 'is not . . . to preserve\n\na work of visual art where it is, but rather to preserve as work as\n\nit is,'\" 2003 WL 21403333, *10) and Soho II (\"'[N]owhere in VARA\n\ndoes the statute make any legal distinction between site-specific\n\nor free-standing works,'\" 2003 WL 21767653, at *3).            The district\n\ncourt concluded \"that an artist has no right to the placement or\n\npublic    presentation    of   his   sculpture   under   the   exception    in\n\n§ 106A(c)(2).\"     Phillips I, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 100.         In short, the\n\ndistrict court found that while VARA applies to site-specific art,\n\nthe public presentation exception permits the removal of site-\n\nspecific art, e.g., Phillips' work in the Park.\n\n            Without in any way diminishing our respect for the\n\ndistrict court's careful handling of this difficult case, we find\n\nits   analysis   of      VARA's   relationship    to     site-specific     art\n\nunpersuasive.      By definition, site-specific art integrates its\n\nlocation as one of its elements.       Therefore, the removal of a site-\n\nspecific work from its location necessarily destroys that work of\n\nart. Here, the district court concluded that VARA recognized site-\n\nspecific art as a type of integrated art, and then concluded that\n\nVARA treats site-specific art the same way that it treats other\n\nintegrated art.9      However, a work of integrated art, unless it is\n\n\n      9\n       A simple example of a work of integrated art that is not\nsite-specific is Marcel Duchamp's work \"Bicycle Wheel\", a sculpture\nintegrating a bicycle fork, a bicycle wheel, and a stool in a\n\n                                     -26-\n\fa    site-specific     work,    is       not    destroyed     by   removal      from    its\n\nlocation.\n\n            By concluding that VARA applies to site-specific art, and\n\nthen allowing the removal of site-specific art pursuant to the\n\npublic presentation exception, the district court purports to\n\nprotect site-specific art under VARA's general provisions, and then\n\npermit    its    destruction        by    the    application       of   one    of   VARA's\n\nexceptions.      To us, this is not a sensible reading of VARA's plain\n\nmeaning. Either VARA recognizes site-specific art and protects it,\n\nor it does not recognize site-specific art at all.\n\nB.    Phillips' position on appeal\n\n                Phillips recognizes the same tension in the district\n\ncourt's   holding      that    we    have       identified,    but      he   resolves    it\n\ndifferently.       He agrees with the district court's position that\n\nVARA applies to site-specific art (as well as integrated art), but\n\ndisagrees       with   the    district          court's   view      that      the   public\n\npresentation exception permits the removal of site-specific art.\n\n\n\n\nparticular arrangement. See Museum of Modern Art, \"Bicycle Wheel\",\nhttp://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=81631\n(last visited July 27, 2006)(image); see also Wikipedia, \"Bicycle\nWheel\", http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_Wheel (last visited\nJuly 27, 2006). However, this sculpture does not integrate its\nlocation and could be part of a traveling exhibition of Duchamp's\nwork without losing its artistic meaning or being destroyed.\n\n                                           -27-\n\f            1.    The public presentation exception\n\n            To circumvent the district court's view of the public\n\npresentation exception,10 Phillips argues that VARA prevents the\n\nremoval   of     site-specific   art    because   the   public    presentation\n\nexception does not apply to site-specific art. His argument begins\n\nwith a claim that the words \"presentation\" and \"placement\" in the\n\npublic    presentation    exception     are   ambiguous   on     the   issue   of\n\nlocation.        We find nothing remotely ambiguous about the word\n\n\"presentation\", which is modified by the word \"placement\".                     The\n\nword \"placement\" inescapably means location.              Noting this fact,\n\nPhillips claims that \"the word placement could suggest something\n\nthat is temporary, as in the placement of furniture, or it could\n\nrefer to something more permanent, as in the placement of a massive\n\npiece of sculpture.\"        Phillips then asks the question that he\n\ndescribes as pivotal: \"does the word placement include something\n\nthat is securely fixed in a particular position as in the case of\n\n. . . [his] integrated work of visual art that spans the northeast-\n\nsouthwest axis of the Park?\"\n\n\n\n\n     10\n        We repeat here the language of § 106A(c)(2), the public\npresentation exception:\n\n     [t]he modification of a work of visual art which is the\n     result of conservation, or of the public presentation,\n     including lighting and placement, of the work is not a\n     destruction,    distortion,   mutilation,    or   other\n     modification described in subsection (a)(3) unless the\n     modification is caused by gross negligence.\n\n                                       -28-\n\f               To answer this question,            Phillips invokes the doctrine\n\nof noscitur a sociis, which counsels that words in a statute should\n\nbe understood in the context of the terms around it.                      See Microsoft\n\nCorp. v. Comm'r, 311 F.3d 1178, 1184 (9th Cir. 2002).                           Relying on\n\nthis doctrine, Phillips asserts that \"lighting and placement must\n\nbe   read     to    be   related    to    each    other    and    be    words    of    equal\n\nsignificance.            If lighting refers to non-permanent changes in\n\npublic      presentation,      then      placement      must     also   refer     to    non-\n\npermanent changes in public presentation.\"                        Phillips continues:\n\n\"[b]uried within the \"placement\" term is the assumption that the\n\nobject is moveable, and can be placed in various locations.                            This\n\nassumption must be examined.                Site-specific artwork is a well-\n\nrecognized form of art, but it is not always moveable.\"\n\n               We agree with Phillips that the premise of the public\n\npresentation        exception      is    artwork    that    can    be   moved     in   some\n\nfashion, such as paintings or sculptures -- that is, art that is\n\nnot permanently affixed or \"integrated\" in such a way that the mere\n\nact of moving it would destroy it.                      The possibility of change\n\nwithout       destruction     is    implicit       in     the    public    presentation\n\nexception.         The public presentation exception defines the types of\n\nchanges, such as those in lighting and placement, that do not\n\nconstitute \"destruction, distortion, or mutilation\".                       But Phillips\n\ndraws     a    startling      conclusion         from     the    public    presentation\n\nexception's focus on permissible change in the presentation of a\n\n\n                                           -29-\n\fwork of visual art: because the public presentation exception\n\naddresses itself only to \"plop-art\", that is, those works of art\n\nsubject to temporary changes in such matters as lighting and\n\nplacement, and declares further that such modifications of a work\n\nof visual art are not \"destroying, distorting, or mutilating\" them,\n\nthe public presentation exception does not apply to site-specific\n\nart, which, as everyone acknowledges, cannot be removed from its\n\nlocation without destroying it. This approach leaves Phillips with\n\nthe district court's holding that VARA applies to site-specific\n\nart, minus the court's related holding that the public presentation\n\nexception permits the removal of such art.               In this way, the\n\ntension   that   we   identified   in   the   district   court's   decision\n\ndisappears.\n\n           2.    Dual regime\n\n           With his position on VARA and the public presentation\n\nexception, Phillips argues that VARA essentially creates a dual\n\nregime -- words that mean one thing as applied to non-site-specific\n\nart have a different meaning when applied to site-specific art.\n\nBeyond his reading of the public presentation exception itself,\n\nPhillips cites only one other provision of VARA in support of his\n\ndual regime argument -- § 113(d)(1)(A) of VARA, the so-called\n\n\"building exception\", which excludes from VARA's protection \"a work\n\nof visual art [that] has been incorporated or made a part of a\n\nbuilding in such a way that removing the work from the building\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fwill    cause   the   destruction,     distortion,   mutilation,      or   other\n\nmodification of the work as described in section 106A(a)(3).\"\n\nPhillips asserts that because VARA provides an exception to VARA\n\nfor artwork attached to buildings, but does not contain a similar\n\nprovision for site-specific art (understood as art attached to real\n\nproperty), VARA must protect site-specific art.\n\n            With      both   the     public   presentation     and    building\n\nexceptions, Phillips is arguing that VARA's silence on a subject is\n\nactually evidence that the statute addresses that subject.                 To say\n\nthe least, this is an odd way to read a statute.             If VARA actually\n\nestablished such a complicated, dual regime, we would expect that\n\nthe phrase \"site-specific\", or some equivalent, would appear in the\n\nlanguage of the statute.             There is no such phrase anywhere.\n\nIndeed, we would expect much more than just a reference to site-\n\nspecific    art.       We    would   expect   an   elaboration   of    how    to\n\ndifferentiate      between    site-specific    and   non-site-specific       art\n\n(plop-art).     That elaboration is nowhere to be found.\n\n            Moreover, the creation of a dual regime -- which would\n\nrequire us, essentially, to rewrite VARA -- has potentially far-\n\nreaching effects beyond the protection of Phillips' work in the\n\nPark.      Once a piece of art is considered site-specific, and\n\nprotected by VARA, such objects could not be altered by the\n\nproperty owner absent consent of the artist.             Such a conclusion\n\ncould dramatically affect real property interests and laws.\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\f           For example, as Pembroke argues in its brief, Phillips'\n\nwork in the Park \"lies within a rapidly changing urban area and\n\nextends beyond Eastport Park to Boston Harbor.\"          If a dual regime\n\nwere created, there is the potential that:\n\n     not only would Pembroke's ability to move [Phillips']\n     work or alter Eastport Park be subject to Phillips'\n     approval, but also the owners of nearby property who had\n     nothing to do with the purchase or installation of\n     Phillips' works would be subject to claims that what they\n     do with their property has somehow affected the site and\n     has, as a result, altered or destroyed Phillips' works.\n\nIn discussing the possibility of MAPA protecting site-specific art,\n\nthe SJC echoed this concern, observing that the creation of a dual\n\nregime under MAPA \"would entail a radical consequence for owners of\n\nland,   that   the   Legislature   directly    averted    for   owners   of\n\nbuildings. Specifically, rights afforded artists would encumber\n\nprivate and public land with restrictions lasting for the life of\n\nthe artist plus fifty years, without the need for such restrictions\n\nto be recorded in a registry of deeds.\"       Phillips II, 819 N.E.2d at\n\n584-85.   The SJC ultimately refused to:\n\n     read such an intent into a legislative act given the\n     recognized legislative policy of disparaging land\n     restrictions (especially unrecorded ones), the common-law\n     doctrine disapproving the long-term burdening of\n     property, and the corollary judicial practice of\n     construing    statutory   provisions    regarding    land\n     restrictions in favor of freedom of alienation.\n\nId. at 585 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           The Supreme Court has also emphasized the principle that\n\n\"statutes which invade the common law are to be read with a\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fpresumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar\n\nprinciples, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is\n\nevident.”   United   States    v.   Texas,    507   U.S.    529,   534   (1993)\n\n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted); see also Astoria\n\nFed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991). \"In\n\nsuch cases, Congress does not write upon a clean slate.              In order\n\nto abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must speak directly\n\nto the question addressed by the common law.\"              Texas, 507 U.S. at\n\n534 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).               Phillips'\n\nargument that VARA's silence on the subject of site-specific art\n\naffords special protection to site-specific art hardly meets this\n\nrequirement of direct address.11\n\n            Ultimately,   we   agree   with    Pembroke's      position    that\n\n\"[t]here is no basis for Phillips' claim that VARA establishes two\n\ndifferent regulatory regimes: one for free-standing works of art .\n\n. . and one for site-specific art that can never be moved and must\n\nalways be displayed.\"     VARA's plain language also requires us to\n\n\n     11\n       As a partial response to these concerns about the burdening\nof property rights, Phillips cites § 106A(e) of VARA, which allows\nartists to waive their VARA rights.         Phillips asserts that\n\"Pembroke had an opportunity to require Phillips to waive his VARA\nrights[, but] Pembroke failed to take advantage of this provision.\"\nThis flawed argument presupposes that VARA protects site-specific\nart in the first place; Phillips has failed to prove this\npresupposition. Phillips cannot argue that Pembroke must ask him\nfor a waiver of moral rights that he has not proven he possesses.\nIn other words, Phillips cannot use the possibility of a waiver of\nmoral rights under VARA as the basis for creating those rights in\nthe first instance. Phillips has turned the logic of waiver on its\nhead. His waiver argument is unavailing.\n\n                                    -33-\n\freject the district court's approach to site-specific art.             VARA\n\ndoes not protect site-specific art and then permit its destruction\n\nby   removal   from   its   site   pursuant   to   the   statute's   public\n\npresentation exception.      VARA does not apply to site-specific art\n\nat all.12\n\n                                    IV.\n\n            We do not denigrate the value or importance of site-\n\nspecific art, which unmistakably enriches our culture and the\n\nbeauty of our public spaces.       We have simply concluded, for all of\n\nthe reasons stated, that the plain language of VARA does not\n\nprotect site-specific art.          If such protection is necessary,\n\nCongress should do the job.         We cannot do it by rewriting the\n\nstatute in the guise of statutory interpretation.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      12\n        \"The words of the statute are the first guide to any\ninterpretation of the meaning of the statute.\"      Greebel v. FTP\nSoftware, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 192 (1st. Cir. 1999). However, on\noccasion, \"[b]oth this court and the Supreme Court have checked a\nsense of a statute's plain meaning against undisputed legislative\nhistory as a guard against judicial error.\" Id. at 192. Here,\nthere is a dispute about VARA's legislative history. Both parties\nhave found statements from legislators that support their position.\nNevertheless, there is one inescapable fact about this history: the\nconcept of site-specific art is never mentioned by name.       That\nhistory only confirms our sense of VARA's plain meaning.\n\n                                    -34-\n\fAddendum\n\n\n\n\n  -35-\n\f",

A work of \"integrated art\" is comprised of two or more physical objects that must be presented together as the artist intended for the work to retain its meaning and integrity. In a work of \"site-specific art\", one of the component physical objects is the location of the art.

Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 85S. The district court ruled that VARA recognized integrated art, and that most of Phillips' sculptures and stonework in the Park constituted \"one integrated `work of visual art'\" &#8212; with the remaining pieces being \"individual free-standing pieces of sculpture, which are not integrated into the other pieces.\" It also held that Phillips' integrated work of art was an example of site-specific art. But the court held that Pembroke could remove Phillips' works from the Park pursuant to VARA's so-called \"public presentation\" exception. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167; 106A(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips challenges that reading of the public presentation exception on appeal.

The artist</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips is a nationally recognized sculptor who works primarily with stone and bronze forms that he integrates into local environs. In many of his sculptures, the design of the stones is incorporated into the landscape &#8212; such as a private project in Ogunquit, Maine, where a band of rock was extended into a bronze tributary in the ground, which, in sunlight, glistened like a nearby stream. In some of his other works, Phillips has merged metals or polished stone with aged, naturally-shaped boulders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips' commissioned work from the past twenty years can be found at private companies and universities and in public spaces across the United States &#8212; in places such as Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., New York, and Utah &#8212; and internationally &#8212; in places such as Tokyo, Japan and Colombia. His work has been profiled in both Japanese and American art magazines, and featured in galleries and museums in, among many places, New York City and Maine. His 1993 promotional brochure details his artistic themes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is Phillips' inherent reverence for natural beauty in this ecologically ravaged world that influences all his decisions, particularly when he recontextualizes a stone by replacing part of its form with a man-made surrogate or when he gracefully applies typical landscaping and architectural materials along with natural stone and traditional art materials into new equations of form and function.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Park</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastport Park (the \"Park\"), which was completed in its current form in the spring of 2000, is located across from Boston Harbor in the South Boston Waterfront District. The Park is roughly rectangular in shape. Its borders are formed by the World Trade Center East Office building to the west, D Street to the east, Seaport Boulevard to the north, and New Congress Street to the south. The Park is a public sculpture park with a nautical theme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Phillips, three other artists also crafted art located in the Park. Japanese sculptor Susumu Shingu created tall kinetic sculptures, Judy McKie contributed bronze, fish-shaped benches, and landscape architect Craig Halvorson designed a pergola (a shady resting place, made of rustic work or latticework on which plants, such as climbing shrubs or vines, are grown). The Park also contains paths that are inlaid with granite paving stones, large granite boulders, and flora meant to evoke an aquatic environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Pembroke Real Estate, Inc. (\"Pembroke\"), a Fidelity Investments company, leases the land on which the Park is built from the Massachusetts Port Authority (\"Massport\"). Massport and the Boston Redevelopment Authority must approve any changes to the design of the Park. The Park is required to be open to the public, free of charge, twenty-four hours a day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Phillips' work in the Park</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, Pembroke commissioned Phillips to work on the Park in conjunction with the development of the World Trade Center East office building that forms the Park's western border. Phillips worked closely with Halvorson on the design of the Park. In fact, he had an oral agreement with Halvorson to act as the artist who worked with the landscape specialists. As part of his work with Halvorson, Phillips aided in the design of a series of repeated spirals that run along the axis of the Park from the northeast to the southwest corner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish the terms of the commission, Phillips and Pembroke executed two contracts in August 1999. Under the \"Eastport Park Artwork Agreement\", Phillips created approximately twenty-seven sculptures for the Park, comprised of fifteen abstract bronze and granite pieces and twelve realistic bronze sculptures of various aquatic creatures, including frogs, crabs, and shrimp. Under the \"Eastport Park Stonework Agreement\", Phillips was responsible for the design and installation of stone walls, granite stones inlaid into the Park's walkways, and other landscape design elements. Most of Phillips' work in the Park is organized along the diagonal axis running from the northeast to the southwest corner, at the center of which is his large spherical sculpture entitled \"Chords\", the centerpiece of the Park, which Phillips personally carved from granite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips designed a bronze medallion with Zodiac signs, which crowns an S-shaped circular granite path, also of Phillips' design; outlying sculptures off of the main axis (many bronze crabs, frogs, and shrimp and a large seashell); and the curve motifs. He worked with a stone mason to choose and place the rough lichen-covered, Maine-quarried stone, and he selected the large granite stones that he used as part of his sculptures to mirror the large granite stones along Boston Harbor. Phillips' work in the Park is unified by a theme of spiral and circular forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

It retained Elizabeth Banks, a British landscape artist, to conduct the redesign. Konstantine Krekis, a member of the original design team, also contributed to the redesign. Believing that the Park's original design had conceptual problems, Pembroke wanted to simplify walkways and include more plants for better shade. Pembroke also wanted to remove much of the original stone, which had caused maintenance problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Banks' redesign plan called for the removal and relocation of Phillips' sculptures. Phillips protested. In January 2003, Pembroke agreed to retain Phillips' rough stone walls and all but one of his sculptures. The new redesign plan would also relocate some of the granite paving and change several walkways and finished granite objects. Objecting to this revised plan, Phillips filed suit in federal district court, seeking injunctive relief under VARA and MAPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 21, 2003, following a nonevidentiary hearing, the district court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining Pembroke from altering the Park. Subsequently, Pembroke declared its return to the original redesign plan, which would remove nearly all of Phillips' work from the Park. After a two-day evidentiary hearing, the district court issued a memorandum and order in which it found that Phillips had established the likelihood of showing: (1) that most, but not all, of his work in the Park constituted \"one `integrated work of visual art,'\" <i>see Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d 89, 98 (D.Mass.2003) (hereinafter \"<i>Phillips I</i>\"); (2) \"an artist has no right to the placement or public presentation of his sculpture under the exception in &#167; 106A(c)(2),\" VARA's public presentation exception (a finding that applied to Phillips' work as both integrated art and site-specific art), <i>id.</i> at 100; and (3) that because \"the environment of Phillips' integrated sculpture along the axis of the Park is a critical element of those works, [] changing the location of the sculpture constitutes an [impermissible] alteration under\" MAPA, <i>id.</i> at 102. Therefore, according to the district court, Pembroke could move Phillips' work from the Park consistent with VARA, so long as Pembroke did not \"alter, modify or destroy the `works of visual art' as [the court] [had] defined them.\" <i>Id.</i> at 100. In other words, consistent with VARA, Phillips' free-standing works could be moved; and the multi-element, integrated work of art along the northeast-southwest axis could be disassembled and moved piecemeal, so long as individual pieces comprising this integrated work of art were not altered, modified, or destroyed. However, under the broader protections of MAPA for site-specific art, the court granted a preliminary injunction preventing Pembroke from altering the Park.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Subsequent procedural history</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties filed interlocutory appeals to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1). In the interim, the district court certified the question of whether MAPA protected Phillips' work in the Park to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\"), and the federal appeals were stayed pending the SJC's resolution of this state law question. <i>See Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.,</i> 443 Mass. 110, 819 N.E.2d 579 (2004) (hereinafter \"<i>Phillips II</i>\"). The specific question certified to the SJC was: \"to what extent does the Massachusetts Art Preservation Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 85S (1984), protect the placement of `site specific' art?\" <i>Id.</i> at 580.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC concluded that MAPA did not protect site-specific art. <i>See id.</i> at 585-86. In particular, the SJC highlighted the following: (1) \"Phillips's contention that the site can be the `medium' of such art [wa]s not consistent with [] dictionary definitions [of the statutory term `medium'],\" <i>id.</i> at 584; (2) \"the Legislature was concerned not only with creating new rights for artists, but also with protecting the rights of property owners who commission artworks that become attached to real property,\" <i>id.;</i> and (3) \"[i]f the Legislature intended to include the type of site-specific art at issue here within MAPA's protections, it would entail a radical consequence for owners of land,\" <i>id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the SJC's ruling and its own prior conclusion that it was possible for Phillips' sculptures to be removed from the Park consistent with VARA because of VARA's public presentation exception, the district court vacated the preliminary injunction it had granted and entered judgment on all counts. On appeal, neither party disputes the district court's finding that Phillips' work in the Park along the northeast-southwest axis is both integrated and site-specific art. Additionally, neither party contests the fact that moving any or all of this integrated work from the Park would constitute a physical alteration of the work. Phillips, for his part, does not claim on appeal that VARA prohibits the removal of integrated art that is not site-specific.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Instead, he claims that VARA prohibits the removal of site-specific art. Therefore, he challenges only the district court's conclusion that the public presentation exception of VARA permits Pembroke to remove from the Park his large, multi-element work of art, which the district court found was both integrated and site-specific.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

According to the district court's summary, another of Phillips' experts, Richard Barreto, Executive Director of the Urban Arts Institute of the Massachusetts College of Art, who is involved in the selection of artists to create art in public spaces, testified that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]oday the concept of \"site specificity\" is the \"rallying cry\" of public artists who seek to create a piece that derives enhanced meaning from its environment.

Because the location of the work contributes to its meaning, site-specific art is destroyed if it is moved from its original site. <i>See</i> Francesca Garson, Note, <i>Before That Artist Came Along, It Was Just a Bridge: The Visual Artists Rights Act and the Removal of Site-Specific Artwork,</i> 11 Cornell J.L. &amp; Pub.

The district court's opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must examine closely the arguments that Phillips presented to the district court, and the district court's responses to those arguments, for two reasons. First, both the statute and the underlying concepts (integrated art and site-specific art) are somewhat complex. Second, the parties could not even agree about the issue on appeal. We must get these basics sorted out before we can analyze the competing arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Phillips' arguments to the district court</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the district court, Phillips sought to prevent Pembroke from altering, moving, or modifying any of his work in the Park in any way. At this time in the chronology of the case, the district court had not yet made its factual finding that Phillips' sculpture and stonework along the northeast-southwest axis comprised a single work of integrated art. Therefore, Phillips first argued that \"his sculptures and the related stonework are works of visual art designed specifically for Eastport Park and they reflect and enhance the Park's location adjacent to Boston Harbor and are inseparable from it.\" In other words, each of his works was site-specific, i.e., each individual piece was integrated with its location in the Park. Phillips also argued that VARA protected each of these works from any change in location because such a change would impermissibly alter them. Under this argument, all of his pieces &#8212; be it any one of his sculptures, or one of the Stone Elements &#8212; \"are meaningful only if they remain in Eastport Park, the location for which they were created.\" As Phillips elaborated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">if any sculptures are moved or removed, the spirit, integrity and character of [the] installations will be destroyed . . . . [because] the meaning and purpose of the art derives in large part from its physical locations. . . . [E]ven if the sculptures and stonework are rebuilt elsewhere someday, the artwork will never be the same as [I] intended it to be, and as it currently exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a corollary to this \"site-specific, individual work\" argument, Phillips also argued that \"[r]emoval of [his] site-specific work would not be a permitted `presentation' or `placement of the work under the section 106A(c)(2) exception,'\" i.e., that Pembroke's proposed removal of some or all of his work from the Park did not fall within VARA's public presentation exception, which permits certain categories of alterations to works of art.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As alternatives, Phillips asserted two integrated work of art arguments in addition to his site-specific, individual work of art argument. First, he contended that the \"Park contains a sufficient number of interrelated works of visual art created by Phillips, so that <i>any</i> modification of <i>any</i> of the interrelated Parts of the Park will have an impact on the other related works, and therefore will be a violation of VARA.\" In other words, apart from any claim that each of the individual sculptures was site-specific, Phillips claimed that each of his individual pieces in the Park was an element of a single, larger, multi-element work of integrated art such that the removal or modification of any one of these elements in the Park would harm the larger, integrated work and violate VARA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a second integrated work of art argument, Phillips argued that while \"this court may not have to determine that the Park as a whole is a work of visual art protected by VARA,\" \"[i]f [keeping all of my work in the Park] means that Eastport Park must be declared to be an inviolate work of art [as a whole], then so be it.\" In other words, Phillips argued that, if necessary, he would assert that the Park as a whole, including the work of the other artists, was a single work of integrated art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Integrated art</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court addressed the integrated art question first:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question is whether Phillips' twenty-seven (27) sculptures constitute a single work of visual art or instead are discrete works of art that must be treated separately under VARA. A related issue is whether the Park as a whole should be treated as a work of visual art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips takes the position that his artwork extends beyond the[] individual sculptures and includes the finished and rough-hewn granite and stone pavings and the stone walls that he designed and placed, including the \"Chords\" path and the medallion path (the \"Stone Elements\"). He also contends that all of his sculptures form one integrated, interrelated work of visual art. To place the sculptural elements in different alignments relative to one another . . . would destroy sight lines and alter the deliberately-crafted spatial relationships among the paths, granite walls, and individual pieces of sculpture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 97-98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had to decide whether the phrase \"work of visual art\", as used in VARA, encompassed the concept of integrated art. The district court first looked to the few existing cases addressing VARA. The court found that \"courts have held that works composed of a variety of pieces and in a variety of media may still constitute one work of `visual art' under VARA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98 (citing <i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 83-84; <i>English v.

The district court next looked to legislative history, particularly a statement instructing courts to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">use common sense and generally accepted standards of the artistic community in determining whether a particular work falls within the scope of the definition [of \"work of visual art\"]. Artists may work in a variety of media, and use any number of materials in creating their works. Therefore, whether a particular work falls within the definition should not depend on the medium or materials used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 98-99 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 101-514, at 6). Based on the case law and legislative history, the district court found that VARA embraced the concept of integrated art: \"Despite [Congress'] narrow definition, courts have held that works composed of a variety of pieces and in a variety of media may still constitute one work of `visual art' under VARA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What remained was a question of fact: whether all of Phillips' work in the Park constituted a single work of visual art? The district court found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the sculptures along the northwest to southeast axis of the Park, including \"Chords\" and the medallion sculpture, as well as the Stone Elements, are one integrated \"work of visual art.\" It begins with a spiral in the northwest corner along Seaport Boulevard, includes Plaintiff's \"Chords\" sculpture, and continues along a spiral path of mosaic paving stone, culminating in the bronze medallion. In determining that the sculptures along this axis, as well as the related Stone Elements, are one work of visual art, the Court relies on the integrated marine theme and recurring spirals, as well as the use of marine granite boulders and pavers. However, the remainder of the sculptures . . . that do not lie along the axis are not part of the same work of visual art. While these sculptures share the marine theme, the Court finds these pieces are individual free-standing pieces of sculpture, which are not integrated into the other pieces by spirals or granite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 98.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In other words, the district court concluded that <i>most</i> of Phillips' pieces in the Park constituted a single work of integrated art, but it rejected his position that <i>all</i> of his pieces comprised a single work of art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then addressed Phillips' argument that the Park itself is an integrated work of art:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]ne novel issue is whether a park can be a \"work of visual art\" under VARA. Phillips contends that the Eastport Park as a whole is one large integrated piece of \"sculpture.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court rejects Plaintiff's argument that the Park as a whole is a work of visual art. As [] Barreto conceded, a park does not fit within the traditional definition of sculpture . . . . Conceivably, a sculptor could design a sculpture garden that includes multiple inter-related sculptural elements that form an integrated work of visual art . . . . However, here, many elements in the Park were not created by Phillips . . . . Substantial areas of the Park are unrelated to Phillips' sculpture and not integrated with it . . . . While Phillips certainly assisted in designing the stone elements in the paths and walls and in placing his own sculptures, the Park as a whole is not an integrated work of art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 98-99 (internal citation omitted). In deciding whether the Park was an integrated work of art, the district court left open the legal question of whether a park could ever be a \"work of visual art\" as defined by VARA. Instead, it held that, assuming a park could be a work of integrated art recognized by VARA, the Park was not such a work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court's conclusion that VARA applied to integrated art, and its related conclusion that Phillips had created a work of integrated art in the Park, did not prevent the removal of Phillips' works from the Park. That was so because the district court also concluded that integrated art was subject to the public presentation exception of VARA, &#167; 106A(c)(2). Phillips' integrated work of art could still be disassembled and moved so long as the \"works of visual art\" are not \"alter[ed], modif[ied], or destroy[ed].\" <i>Id.</i> at 100.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Site-specific art</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remained Phillips' site-specificity argument. If Phillips could show that: (1) his work in the Park was site-specific art; (2) VARA protected site-specific art; and (3) that the public presentation exception did not apply to site-specific art, none of his work could be moved, even on a piecemeal basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips convinced the district court that most of his work in the Park was site-specific as well as integrated. In discussing the issue of site-specificity as part of its discussion of MAPA, the district court made the following factual finding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that Phillips' sculpture has a marine theme that integrates the large granite stones of the park with his sculpture and the granite sea walls of Boston Harbor into one interrelated visual work of art. Therefore, Phillips used the harborside location at Eastport Park as one medium of his art. To move Phillips' integrated work of visual art (i.e., the sculptures, boulders, and granite paths along the axis, which I described in the VARA discussion) to another location (particularly a non-marine one) would be to alter it physically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 102.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having made this finding on the site-specific nature of Phillips' work, the district court explained the positions of Phillips and Pembroke on site-specificity:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Phillips] [] argues that his work is so site-specific that moving it would be an intentional destruction or modification under VARA.

It then found Pembroke's legal argument \"more persuasive because it is rooted in the plain language of the exclusion in &#167; 106A(c)(2) as well as the statute's legislative history.\" <i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 100; <i>see also id.</i> (\" `Generally, the removal of a work from a specific location comes within the [presentation] exclusion because the location is a matter of presentation.'\") (quoting H.R.Rep.

United States Gen. Serv. Admin.,</i> 847 F.2d 1045 (2d Cir.1988). In <i>Serra,</i> the Second Circuit rejected the plaintiff's argument that the removal of an integrated, site-specific, government-owned work of art from federal property violated the free expression and due process rights of the artist. <i>See Serra,</i> 847 F.2d at 1045. The district court inferred that because VARA and the public presentation exception were adopted after <i>Serra,</i> Congress must have been aware of site-specific art. Yet VARA says nothing that suggests special protection for site-specific art. Therefore, the district court concluded that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">an artist has no right to the placement or public presentation of his sculpture under the exception in &#167; 106A(c)(2). [Pembroke] is not obligated to display the works in the Park, as VARA provides no protection for a change in placement or presentation. However, under VARA, [Pembroke] is under an obligation not to alter, modify or destroy the \"works of visual art\" as I have defined them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 100.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the conclusion that Phillips challenges on appeal. As he puts it: \"the District Court misinterpreted the language and Legislative history of the [public presentation exception], and [] VARA protects Phillips' artwork from the removal planned by Pembroke.\" Pembroke asserts, <i>inter alia,</i> that the district court ruled correctly that the public presentation exception negates any protection VARA extends to site-specific art. More fundamentally, it argues that VARA does not apply to site-specific art at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's decision is <i>de novo.

Sigmon Coal Co.,</i> 534 U.S. 438, 450, 122 S.Ct. 941, 151 L.Ed.2d 908 (2002). Furthermore, \"[w]e have consistently held that when the plain meaning of a statute is clear, we are not to look beyond that text to discern legislative intent.\" <i>Palmieri v.

The district court's understanding of site-specific art and VARA</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To help explain our holding that VARA does not apply to site-specific art, we must begin with a restatement of the district court's view of the interaction between VARA and site-specific art. On the one hand, the district court accepted the concept of site-specific art. It credited the unopposed testimony of Ranalli, Phillips' expert, \"that for site specific art, the location of the work is a constituent element of the work.\" <i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 95. The district court understood that \"[u]nder this approach, because the location defines the art, site-specific sculpture is destroyed if it is moved from the site.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court also found that \"[t]o move Phillips' integrated work of visual art (i.e., the sculptures, boulders, and granite paths along the axis . . . described in the VARA discussion) to another location . . . would be to alter it physically,\" <i>id.</i> at 102.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, in the section of its opinion addressing Phillips' site-specificity argument &#8212; entitled \"`Public-Presentation' Exclusion\" &#8212; the district court noted that \"Section 106A(c)(2) has been interpreted to exclude from VARA's protection `site-specific' works, works that would be modified if they were moved.\" <i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 99. It then referenced <i>Soho I</i> (\"[T]he point of VARA `is not . . . to preserve a work of visual art <i>where</i> it is, but rather to preserve as work <i>as</i> it is,'\" 2003 WL 21403333, *10) and <i>Soho II</i> (\"`[N]owhere in VARA does the statute make any legal distinction between site-specific or free-standing works,'\" 2003 WL 21767653, at *3). The district court concluded \"that an artist has no right to the placement or public presentation of his sculpture under the exception in &#167; 106A(c)(2).\" <i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 100. In short, the district court found that while VARA applies to site-specific art, the public presentation exception permits the removal of site-specific art, e.g., Phillips' work in the Park.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without in any way diminishing our respect for the district court's careful handling of this difficult case, we find its analysis of VARA's relationship to site-specific art unpersuasive. By definition, site-specific art integrates its location as one of its elements. Therefore, the removal of a site-specific work from its location necessarily destroys that work of art. Here, the district court concluded that VARA recognized site-specific art as a type of integrated art, and then concluded that VARA treats site-specific art the same way that it treats other integrated art.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> However, a work of integrated art, unless it is a site-specific work, is not destroyed by removal from its location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By concluding that VARA applies to site-specific art, and then allowing the removal of site-specific art pursuant to the public presentation exception, the district court purports to protect site-specific art under VARA's general provisions, and then permit its destruction by the application of one of VARA's exceptions. To us, this is not a sensible reading of VARA's plain meaning. Either VARA recognizes site-specific art and protects it, or it does not recognize site-specific art at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Phillips' position on appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips recognizes the same tension in the district court's holding that we have identified, but he resolves it differently. He agrees with the district court's position that VARA applies to site-specific art (as well as integrated art), but disagrees with the district court's view that the public presentation exception permits the removal of site-specific art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The public presentation exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To circumvent the district court's view of the public presentation exception,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Phillips argues that VARA prevents the removal of site-specific art because the public presentation exception does not apply to site-specific art. His argument begins with a claim that the words \"presentation\" and \"placement\" in the public presentation exception are ambiguous on the issue of location. We find nothing remotely ambiguous about the word \"presentation\", which is modified by the word \"placement\". The word \"placement\" inescapably means location. Noting this fact, Phillips claims that \"the word placement could suggest something that is temporary, as in the placement of furniture, or it could refer to something more permanent, as in the placement of a massive piece of sculpture.\" Phillips then asks the question that he describes as pivotal: \"does the word placement include something that is securely fixed in a particular position as in the case of. . . [his] integrated work of visual art that spans the northeast-southwest axis of the Park?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To answer this question, Phillips invokes the doctrine of <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> which counsels that words in a statute should be understood in the context of the terms around it. <i>See Microsoft Corp. v. Comm'r,</i> 311 F.3d 1178, 1184 (9th Cir.2002). Relying on this doctrine, Phillips asserts that \"<i>lighting</i> and <i>placement</i> must be read to be related to each other and be words of equal significance. If lighting refers to non-permanent changes in public presentation, then placement must also refer to non-permanent changes in public presentation.\" Phillips continues: \"[b]uried within the \"placement\" term is the assumption that the object is moveable, and can be placed in various locations. This assumption must be examined. Site-specific artwork is a well-recognized form of art, but it is not always moveable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Phillips that the premise of the public presentation exception is artwork that can be moved in some fashion, such as paintings or sculptures &#8212; that is, art that is not permanently affixed or \"integrated\" in such a way that the mere act of moving it would destroy it. The possibility of change without destruction is implicit in the public presentation exception. The public presentation exception defines the types of changes, such as those in lighting and placement, that do not constitute \"destruction, distortion, or mutilation\". But Phillips draws a startling conclusion from the public presentation exception's focus on permissible change in the presentation of a work of visual art: because the public presentation exception addresses itself only to \"plop-art\", that is, those works of art subject to temporary changes in such matters as lighting and placement, and declares further that such modifications of a work of visual art are not \"destroying, distorting, or mutilating\" them, the public presentation exception does not apply to site-specific art, which, as everyone acknowledges, cannot be removed from its location without destroying it. This approach leaves Phillips with the district court's holding that VARA applies to site-specific art, minus the court's related holding that the public presentation exception permits the removal of such art. In this way, the tension that we identified in the district court's decision disappears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Dual regime</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With his position on VARA and the public presentation exception, Phillips argues that VARA essentially creates a dual regime &#8212; words that mean one thing as applied to non-site-specific art have a different meaning when applied to site-specific art. Beyond his reading of the public presentation exception itself, Phillips cites only one other provision of VARA in support of his dual regime argument &#8212; &#167; 113(d)(1)(A) of VARA, the so-called \"building exception\", which excludes from VARA's protection \"a work of visual art [that] has been incorporated or made a part of a building in such a way that removing the work from the building will cause the destruction, distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work as described in section 106A(a)(3).\" Phillips asserts that because VARA provides an exception to VARA for artwork attached to buildings, but does not contain a similar provision for site-specific art (understood as art attached to real property), VARA must protect site-specific art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With both the public presentation and building exceptions, Phillips is arguing that VARA's silence on a subject is actually evidence that the statute addresses that subject. To say the least, this is an odd way to read a statute. If VARA actually established such a complicated, dual regime, we would expect that the phrase \"site-specific\", or some equivalent, would appear in the language of the statute. There is no such phrase anywhere. Indeed, we would expect much more than just a reference to site-specific art. We would expect an elaboration of how to differentiate between site-specific and non-site-specific art (plop-art). That elaboration is nowhere to be found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the creation of a dual regime &#8212; which would require us, essentially, to rewrite VARA &#8212; has potentially far-reaching effects beyond the protection of Phillips' work in the Park. Once a piece of art is considered site-specific, and protected by VARA, such objects could not be altered by the property owner absent consent of the artist. Such a conclusion could dramatically affect real property interests and laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, as Pembroke argues in its brief, Phillips' work in the Park \"lies within a rapidly changing urban area and extends beyond Eastport Park to Boston Harbor.\" If a dual regime were created, there is the potential that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">not only would Pembroke's ability to move [Phillips'] work or alter Eastport Park be subject to Phillips' approval, but also the owners of nearby property who had nothing to do with the purchase or installation of Phillips' works would be subject to claims that what they do with <i>their</i> property has somehow affected the site and has, as a result, altered or destroyed Phillips' works.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In discussing the possibility of MAPA protecting site-specific art, the SJC echoed this concern, observing that the creation of a dual regime under MAPA \"would entail a radical consequence for owners of land, that the Legislature directly averted for owners of buildings. Specifically, rights afforded artists would encumber private and public land with restrictions lasting for the life of the artist plus fifty years, without the need for such restrictions to be recorded in a registry of deeds.\" <i>Phillips II,</i> 819 N.E.2d at 584-85. The SJC ultimately refused to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">read such an intent into a legislative act given the recognized legislative policy of disparaging land restrictions (especially unrecorded ones), the common-law doctrine disapproving the long-term burdening of property, and the corollary judicial practice of construing statutory provisions regarding land restrictions in favor of freedom of alienation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 585 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has also emphasized the principle that \"statutes which invade the common law are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.\" <i>United States v. Texas,</i> 507 U.S. 529, 534, 113 S.Ct. 1631, 123 L.Ed.2d 245 (1993) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Solimino,</i> 501 U.S. 104, 108, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 115 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991). \"In such cases, Congress does not write upon a clean slate. In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must speak directly to the question addressed by the common law.\" <i>Texas,</i> 507 U.S. at 534, 113 S.Ct. 1631 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Phillips' argument that VARA's silence on the subject of site-specific art affords special protection to site-specific art hardly meets this requirement of direct address.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, we agree with Pembroke's position that \"[t]here is no basis for Phillips' claim that VARA establishes two different regulatory regimes: one for free-standing works of art ... and one for site-specific art that can never be moved and must always be displayed.\" VARA's plain language also requires us to reject the district court's approach to site-specific art. VARA does not protect site-specific art and then permit its destruction by removal from its site pursuant to the statute's public presentation exception. VARA does not apply to site-specific art at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not denigrate the value or importance of site-specific art, which unmistakably enriches our culture and the beauty of our public spaces. We have simply concluded, for all of the reasons stated, that the plain language of VARA does not protect site-specific art. If such protection is necessary, Congress should do the job. We cannot do it by rewriting the statute in the guise of statutory interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Addendum</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p>NOTE: OPINION CONTAINING TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To be clear, we are not saying that, in fact, Phillips does not believe that VARA prohibits the removal of integrated art that is not site-specific.

A work of \"integrated art\" is comprised of two or more physical objects that must be presented together as the artist intended for the work to retain its meaning and integrity. In a work of \"site-specific art\", one of the component physical objects is the location of the art. To remove a work of site-specific art from its original site is to destroy it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Phillips brought suit against Pembroke Real Estate, Inc. in federal district court, asserting that the removal of any or all of his work, consisting of multiple pieces of sculpture and stonework, from Eastport Park in South Boston would violate his statutory rights under VARA and the Massachusetts Art Preservation Act (\"MAPA\"), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 85S. The district court ruled that VARA recognized integrated art, and that most of Phillips' sculptures and stonework in the Park constituted \"one integrated `work of visual art'\" &#8212; with the remaining pieces being \"individual free-standing pieces of sculpture, which are not integrated into the other pieces.\" It also held that Phillips' integrated work of art was an example of site-specific art. But the court held that Pembroke could remove Phillips' works from the Park pursuant to VARA's so-called \"public presentation\" exception. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167; 106A(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips challenges that reading of the public presentation exception on appeal. Although we disagree with the district court's reasoning (we hold that VARA does not apply to site-specific art at all), we affirm the decision of the district court permitting Pembroke to remove Phillips' works from the Park.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The artist</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips is a nationally recognized sculptor who works primarily with stone and bronze forms that he integrates into local environs. In many of his sculptures, the design of the stones is incorporated into the landscape &#8212; such as a private project in Ogunquit, Maine, where a band of rock was extended into a bronze tributary in the ground, which, in sunlight, glistened like a nearby stream. In some of his other works, Phillips has merged metals or polished stone with aged, naturally-shaped boulders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips' commissioned work from the past twenty years can be found at private companies and universities and in public spaces across the United States &#8212; in places such as Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., New York, and Utah &#8212; and internationally &#8212; in places such as Tokyo, Japan and Colombia. His work has been profiled in both Japanese and American art magazines, and featured in galleries and museums in, among many places, New York City and Maine. His 1993 promotional brochure details his artistic themes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is Phillips' inherent reverence for natural beauty in this ecologically ravaged world that influences all his decisions, particularly when he recontextualizes a stone by replacing part of its form with a man-made surrogate or when he gracefully applies typical landscaping and architectural materials along with natural stone and traditional art materials into new equations of form and function.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Park</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastport Park (the \"Park\"), which was completed in its current form in the spring of 2000, is located across from Boston Harbor in the South Boston Waterfront District. The Park is roughly rectangular in shape. Its borders are formed by the World Trade Center East Office building to the west, D Street to the east, Seaport Boulevard to the north, and New Congress Street to the south. The Park is a public sculpture park with a nautical theme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Phillips, three other artists also crafted art located in the Park. Japanese sculptor Susumu Shingu created tall kinetic sculptures, Judy McKie contributed bronze, fish-shaped benches, and landscape architect Craig Halvorson designed a pergola (a shady resting place, made of rustic work or latticework on which plants, such as climbing shrubs or vines, are grown). The Park also contains paths that are inlaid with granite paving stones, large granite boulders, and flora meant to evoke an aquatic environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Pembroke Real Estate, Inc. (\"Pembroke\"), a Fidelity Investments company, leases the land on which the Park is built from the Massachusetts Port Authority (\"Massport\"). Massport and the Boston Redevelopment Authority must approve any changes to the design of the Park. The Park is required to be open to the public, free of charge, twenty-four hours a day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Phillips' work in the Park</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, Pembroke commissioned Phillips to work on the Park in conjunction with the development of the World Trade Center East office building that forms the Park's western border. Phillips worked closely with Halvorson on the design of the Park. In fact, he had an oral agreement with Halvorson to act as the artist who worked with the landscape specialists. As part of his work with Halvorson, Phillips aided in the design of a series of repeated spirals that run along the axis of the Park from the northeast to the southwest corner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish the terms of the commission, Phillips and Pembroke executed two contracts in August 1999. Under the \"Eastport Park Artwork Agreement\", Phillips created approximately twenty-seven sculptures for the Park, comprised of fifteen abstract bronze and granite pieces and twelve realistic bronze sculptures of various aquatic creatures, including frogs, crabs, and shrimp. Under the \"Eastport Park Stonework Agreement\", Phillips was responsible for the design and installation of stone walls, granite stones inlaid into the Park's walkways, and other landscape design elements. Most of Phillips' work in the Park is organized along the diagonal axis running from the northeast to the southwest corner, at the center of which is his large spherical sculpture entitled \"Chords\", the centerpiece of the Park, which Phillips personally carved from granite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips designed a bronze medallion with Zodiac signs, which crowns an S-shaped circular granite path, also of Phillips' design; outlying sculptures off of the main axis (many bronze crabs, frogs, and shrimp and a large seashell); and the curve motifs. He worked with a stone mason to choose and place the rough lichen-covered, Maine-quarried stone, and he selected the large granite stones that he used as part of his sculptures to mirror the large granite stones along Boston Harbor. Phillips' work in the Park is unified by a theme of spiral and circular forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Pembroke's redesign of the Park and the preliminary injunction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2001, Pembroke decided to alter the Park. It retained Elizabeth Banks, a British landscape artist, to conduct the redesign. Konstantine Krekis, a member of the original design team, also contributed to the redesign. Believing that the Park's original design had conceptual problems, Pembroke wanted to simplify walkways and include more plants for better shade. Pembroke also wanted to remove much of the original stone, which had caused maintenance problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Banks' redesign plan called for the removal and relocation of Phillips' sculptures. Phillips protested. In January 2003, Pembroke agreed to retain Phillips' rough stone walls and all but one of his sculptures. The new redesign plan would also relocate some of the granite paving and change several walkways and finished granite objects. Objecting to this revised plan, Phillips filed suit in federal district court, seeking injunctive relief under VARA and MAPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 21, 2003, following a nonevidentiary hearing, the district court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining Pembroke from altering the Park. Subsequently, Pembroke declared its return to the original redesign plan, which would remove nearly all of Phillips' work from the Park. After a two-day evidentiary hearing, the district court issued a memorandum and order in which it found that Phillips had established the likelihood of showing: (1) that most, but not all, of his work in the Park constituted \"one `integrated work of visual art,'\" <i>see Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2509154\"><a href=\"/opinion/2509154/phillips-v-pembroke-real-estate-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 98 (D.Mass.2003) (hereinafter \"<i>Phillips I</i>\"); (2) \"an artist has no right to the placement or public presentation of his sculpture under the exception in &#167; 106A(c)(2),\" VARA's public presentation exception (a finding that applied to Phillips' work as both integrated art and site-specific art), <i>id.</i> at 100; and (3) that because \"the environment of Phillips' integrated sculpture along the axis of the Park is a critical element of those works, [] changing the location of the sculpture constitutes an [impermissible] alteration under\" MAPA, <i>id.</i> at 102. Therefore, according to the district court, Pembroke could move Phillips' work from the Park consistent with VARA, so long as Pembroke did not \"alter, modify or destroy the `works of visual art' as [the court] [had] defined them.\" <i>Id.</i> at 100. In other words, consistent with VARA, Phillips' free-standing works could be moved; and the multi-element, integrated work of art along the northeast-southwest axis could be disassembled and moved piecemeal, so long as individual pieces comprising this integrated work of art were not altered, modified, or destroyed. However, under the broader protections of MAPA for site-specific art, the court granted a preliminary injunction preventing Pembroke from altering the Park.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Subsequent procedural history</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties filed interlocutory appeals to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1). In the interim, the district court certified the question of whether MAPA protected Phillips' work in the Park to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\"), and the federal appeals were stayed pending the SJC's resolution of this state law question. <i>See Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span> (2004) (hereinafter \"<i>Phillips II</i>\"). The specific question certified to the SJC was: \"to what extent does the Massachusetts Art Preservation Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 85S (1984), protect the placement of `site specific' art?\" <i>Id.</i> at 580.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC concluded that MAPA did not protect site-specific art. <i>See id.</i> at 585-86. In particular, the SJC highlighted the following: (1) \"Phillips's contention that the site can be the `medium' of such art [wa]s not consistent with [] dictionary definitions [of the statutory term `medium'],\" <i>id.</i> at 584; (2) \"the Legislature was concerned not only with creating new rights for artists, but also with protecting the rights of property owners who commission artworks that become attached to real property,\" <i>id.;</i> and (3) \"[i]f the Legislature intended to include the type of site-specific art at issue here within MAPA's protections, it would entail a radical consequence for owners of land,\" <i>id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the SJC's ruling and its own prior conclusion that it was possible for Phillips' sculptures to be removed from the Park consistent with VARA because of VARA's public presentation exception, the district court vacated the preliminary injunction it had granted and entered judgment on all counts. On appeal, neither party disputes the district court's finding that Phillips' work in the Park along the northeast-southwest axis is both integrated and site-specific art. Additionally, neither party contests the fact that moving any or all of this integrated work from the Park would constitute a physical alteration of the work. Phillips, for his part, does not claim on appeal that VARA prohibits the removal of integrated art that is not site-specific.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Instead, he claims that VARA prohibits the removal of site-specific art. Therefore, he challenges only the district court's conclusion that the public presentation exception of VARA permits Pembroke to remove from the Park his large, multi-element work of art, which the district court found was both integrated and site-specific.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

A piece of plop-art does not incorporate its surroundings. Site-specific art is the opposite of plop-art.

The district court's opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must examine closely the arguments that Phillips presented to the district court, and the district court's responses to those arguments, for two reasons. First, both the statute and the underlying concepts (integrated art and site-specific art) are somewhat complex. Second, the parties could not even agree about the issue on appeal. We must get these basics sorted out before we can analyze the competing arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Phillips' arguments to the district court</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the district court, Phillips sought to prevent Pembroke from altering, moving, or modifying any of his work in the Park in any way. At this time in the chronology of the case, the district court had not yet made its factual finding that Phillips' sculpture and stonework along the northeast-southwest axis comprised a single work of integrated art. Therefore, Phillips first argued that \"his sculptures and the related stonework are works of visual art designed specifically for Eastport Park and they reflect and enhance the Park's location adjacent to Boston Harbor and are inseparable from it.\" In other words, each of his works was site-specific, i.e., each individual piece was integrated with its location in the Park. Phillips also argued that VARA protected each of these works from any change in location because such a change would impermissibly alter them. Under this argument, all of his pieces &#8212; be it any one of his sculptures, or one of the Stone Elements &#8212; \"are meaningful only if they remain in Eastport Park, the location for which they were created.\" As Phillips elaborated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">if any sculptures are moved or removed, the spirit, integrity and character of [the] installations will be destroyed . . . . [because] the meaning and purpose of the art derives in large part from its physical locations. . . . [E]ven if the sculptures and stonework are rebuilt elsewhere someday, the artwork will never be the same as [I] intended it to be, and as it currently exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a corollary to this \"site-specific, individual work\" argument, Phillips also argued that \"[r]emoval of [his] site-specific work would not be a permitted `presentation' or `placement of the work under the section 106A(c)(2) exception,'\" i.e., that Pembroke's proposed removal of some or all of his work from the Park did not fall within VARA's public presentation exception, which permits certain categories of alterations to works of art.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As alternatives, Phillips asserted two integrated work of art arguments in addition to his site-specific, individual work of art argument. First, he contended that the \"Park contains a sufficient number of interrelated works of visual art created by Phillips, so that <i>any</i> modification of <i>any</i> of the interrelated Parts of the Park will have an impact on the other related works, and therefore will be a violation of VARA.\" In other words, apart from any claim that each of the individual sculptures was site-specific, Phillips claimed that each of his individual pieces in the Park was an element of a single, larger, multi-element work of integrated art such that the removal or modification of any one of these elements in the Park would harm the larger, integrated work and violate VARA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a second integrated work of art argument, Phillips argued that while \"this court may not have to determine that the Park as a whole is a work of visual art protected by VARA,\" \"[i]f [keeping all of my work in the Park] means that Eastport Park must be declared to be an inviolate work of art [as a whole], then so be it.\" In other words, Phillips argued that, if necessary, he would assert that the Park as a whole, including the work of the other artists, was a single work of integrated art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Integrated art</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court addressed the integrated art question first:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question is whether Phillips' twenty-seven (27) sculptures constitute a single work of visual art or instead are discrete works of art that must be treated separately under VARA. A related issue is whether the Park as a whole should be treated as a work of visual art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips takes the position that his artwork extends beyond the[] individual sculptures and includes the finished and rough-hewn granite and stone pavings and the stone walls that he designed and placed, including the \"Chords\" path and the medallion path (the \"Stone Elements\"). He also contends that all of his sculptures form one integrated, interrelated work of visual art. To place the sculptural elements in different alignments relative to one another . . . would destroy sight lines and alter the deliberately-crafted spatial relationships among the paths, granite walls, and individual pieces of sculpture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 97-98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had to decide whether the phrase \"work of visual art\", as used in VARA, encompassed the concept of integrated art. The district court first looked to the few existing cases addressing VARA. The court found that \"courts have held that works composed of a variety of pieces and in a variety of media may still constitute one work of `visual art' under VARA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98 (citing <i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 83-84; <i>English v.

The district court next looked to legislative history, particularly a statement instructing courts to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">use common sense and generally accepted standards of the artistic community in determining whether a particular work falls within the scope of the definition [of \"work of visual art\"]. Artists may work in a variety of media, and use any number of materials in creating their works. Therefore, whether a particular work falls within the definition should not depend on the medium or materials used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 98-99 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 101-514, at 6). Based on the case law and legislative history, the district court found that VARA embraced the concept of integrated art: \"Despite [Congress'] narrow definition, courts have held that works composed of a variety of pieces and in a variety of media may still constitute one work of `visual art' under VARA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What remained was a question of fact: whether all of Phillips' work in the Park constituted a single work of visual art? The district court found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the sculptures along the northwest to southeast axis of the Park, including \"Chords\" and the medallion sculpture, as well as the Stone Elements, are one integrated \"work of visual art.\" It begins with a spiral in the northwest corner along Seaport Boulevard, includes Plaintiff's \"Chords\" sculpture, and continues along a spiral path of mosaic paving stone, culminating in the bronze medallion. In determining that the sculptures along this axis, as well as the related Stone Elements, are one work of visual art, the Court relies on the integrated marine theme and recurring spirals, as well as the use of marine granite boulders and pavers. However, the remainder of the sculptures . . . that do not lie along the axis are not part of the same work of visual art. While these sculptures share the marine theme, the Court finds these pieces are individual free-standing pieces of sculpture, which are not integrated into the other pieces by spirals or granite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 98.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In other words, the district court concluded that <i>most</i> of Phillips' pieces in the Park constituted a single work of integrated art, but it rejected his position that <i>all</i> of his pieces comprised a single work of art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then addressed Phillips' argument that the Park itself is an integrated work of art:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]ne novel issue is whether a park can be a \"work of visual art\" under VARA.

As [] Barreto conceded, a park does not fit within the traditional definition of sculpture . . . . Conceivably, a sculptor could design a sculpture garden that includes multiple inter-related sculptural elements that form an integrated work of visual art . . . . However, here, many elements in the Park were not created by Phillips . . . . Substantial areas of the Park are unrelated to Phillips' sculpture and not integrated with it . . . . While Phillips certainly assisted in designing the stone elements in the paths and walls and in placing his own sculptures, the Park as a whole is not an integrated work of art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 98-99 (internal citation omitted). In deciding whether the Park was an integrated work of art, the district court left open the legal question of whether a park could ever be a \"work of visual art\" as defined by VARA. Instead, it held that, assuming a park could be a work of integrated art recognized by VARA, the Park was not such a work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court's conclusion that VARA applied to integrated art, and its related conclusion that Phillips had created a work of integrated art in the Park, did not prevent the removal of Phillips' works from the Park. That was so because the district court also concluded that integrated art was subject to the public presentation exception of VARA, &#167; 106A(c)(2). Phillips' integrated work of art could still be disassembled and moved so long as the \"works of visual art\" are not \"alter[ed], modif[ied], or destroy[ed].\" <i>Id.</i> at 100.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Site-specific art</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remained Phillips' site-specificity argument. If Phillips could show that: (1) his work in the Park was site-specific art; (2) VARA protected site-specific art; and (3) that the public presentation exception did not apply to site-specific art, none of his work could be moved, even on a piecemeal basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips convinced the district court that most of his work in the Park was site-specific as well as integrated. In discussing the issue of site-specificity as part of its discussion of MAPA, the district court made the following factual finding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that Phillips' sculpture has a marine theme that integrates the large granite stones of the park with his sculpture and the granite sea walls of Boston Harbor into one interrelated visual work of art. Therefore, Phillips used the harborside location at Eastport Park as one medium of his art. To move Phillips' integrated work of visual art (i.e., the sculptures, boulders, and granite paths along the axis, which I described in the VARA discussion) to another location (particularly a non-marine one) would be to alter it physically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 102.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having made this finding on the site-specific nature of Phillips' work, the district court explained the positions of Phillips and Pembroke on site-specificity:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Phillips] [] argues that his work is so site-specific that moving it would be an intentional destruction or modification under VARA.

It then found Pembroke's legal argument \"more persuasive because it is rooted in the plain language of the exclusion in &#167; 106A(c)(2) as well as the statute's legislative history.\" <i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 100; <i>see also id.</i> (\" `Generally, the removal of a work from a specific location comes within the [presentation] exclusion because the location is a matter of presentation.'\") (quoting H.R.Rep.

In <i>Serra,</i> the Second Circuit rejected the plaintiff's argument that the removal of an integrated, site-specific, government-owned work of art from federal property violated the free expression and due process rights of the artist. <i>See Serra,</i> 847 F.2d at 1045. The district court inferred that because VARA and the public presentation exception were adopted after <i>Serra,</i> Congress must have been aware of site-specific art. Yet VARA says nothing that suggests special protection for site-specific art. Therefore, the district court concluded that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">an artist has no right to the placement or public presentation of his sculpture under the exception in &#167; 106A(c)(2). [Pembroke] is not obligated to display the works in the Park, as VARA provides no protection for a change in placement or presentation.

On the one hand, the district court accepted the concept of site-specific art. It credited the unopposed testimony of Ranalli, Phillips' expert, \"that for site specific art, the location of the work is a constituent element of the work.\" <i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 95. The district court understood that \"[u]nder this approach, because the location defines the art, site-specific sculpture is destroyed if it is moved from the site.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court also found that \"[t]o move Phillips' integrated work of visual art (i.e., the sculptures, boulders, and granite paths along the axis . . . described in the VARA discussion) to another location . . . would be to alter it physically,\" <i>id.</i> at 102.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, in the section of its opinion addressing Phillips' site-specificity argument &#8212; entitled \"`Public-Presentation' Exclusion\" &#8212; the district court noted that \"Section 106A(c)(2) has been interpreted to exclude from VARA's protection `site-specific' works, works that would be modified if they were moved.\" <i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 99. It then referenced <i>Soho I</i> (\"[T]he point of VARA `is not . . . to preserve a work of visual art <i>where</i> it is, but rather to preserve as work <i>as</i> it is,'\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">21403333</span></span>, *10) and <i>Soho II</i> (\"`[N]owhere in VARA does the statute make any legal distinction between site-specific or free-standing works,'\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">21767653</span></span>, at *3). The district court concluded \"that an artist has no right to the placement or public presentation of his sculpture under the exception in &#167; 106A(c)(2).\" <i>Phillips I,</i> 288 F.Supp.2d at 100. In short, the district court found that while VARA applies to site-specific art, the public presentation exception permits the removal of site-specific art, e.g., Phillips' work in the Park.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without in any way diminishing our respect for the district court's careful handling of this difficult case, we find its analysis of VARA's relationship to site-specific art unpersuasive. By definition, site-specific art integrates its location as one of its elements. Therefore, the removal of a site-specific work from its location necessarily destroys that work of art. Here, the district court concluded that VARA recognized site-specific art as a type of integrated art, and then concluded that VARA treats site-specific art the same way that it treats other integrated art.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> However, a work of integrated art, unless it is a site-specific work, is not destroyed by removal from its location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By concluding that VARA applies to site-specific art, and then allowing the removal of site-specific art pursuant to the public presentation exception, the district court purports to protect site-specific art under VARA's general provisions, and then permit its destruction by the application of one of VARA's exceptions. To us, this is not a sensible reading of VARA's plain meaning. Either VARA recognizes site-specific art and protects it, or it does not recognize site-specific art at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Phillips' position on appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips recognizes the same tension in the district court's holding that we have identified, but he resolves it differently. He agrees with the district court's position that VARA applies to site-specific art (as well as integrated art), but disagrees with the district court's view that the public presentation exception permits the removal of site-specific art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The public presentation exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To circumvent the district court's view of the public presentation exception,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Phillips argues that VARA prevents the removal of site-specific art because the public presentation exception does not apply to site-specific art. His argument begins with a claim that the words \"presentation\" and \"placement\" in the public presentation exception are ambiguous on the issue of location. We find nothing remotely ambiguous about the word \"presentation\", which is modified by the word \"placement\". The word \"placement\" inescapably means location. Noting this fact, Phillips claims that \"the word placement could suggest something that is temporary, as in the placement of furniture, or it could refer to something more permanent, as in the placement of a massive piece of sculpture.\" Phillips then asks the question that he describes as pivotal: \"does the word placement include something that is securely fixed in a particular position as in the case of. . . [his] integrated work of visual art that spans the northeast-southwest axis of the Park?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To answer this question, Phillips invokes the doctrine of <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> which counsels that words in a statute should be understood in the context of the terms around it. <i>See Microsoft Corp. v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779987\"><a href=\"/opinion/779987/microsoft-corporation-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1178</span></a></span>, 1184 (9th Cir.2002). Relying on this doctrine, Phillips asserts that \"<i>lighting</i> and <i>placement</i> must be read to be related to each other and be words of equal significance. If lighting refers to non-permanent changes in public presentation, then placement must also refer to non-permanent changes in public presentation.\" Phillips continues: \"[b]uried within the \"placement\" term is the assumption that the object is moveable, and can be placed in various locations. This assumption must be examined. Site-specific artwork is a well-recognized form of art, but it is not always moveable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Phillips that the premise of the public presentation exception is artwork that can be moved in some fashion, such as paintings or sculptures &#8212; that is, art that is not permanently affixed or \"integrated\" in such a way that the mere act of moving it would destroy it. The possibility of change without destruction is implicit in the public presentation exception. The public presentation exception defines the types of changes, such as those in lighting and placement, that do not constitute \"destruction, distortion, or mutilation\". But Phillips draws a startling conclusion from the public presentation exception's focus on permissible change in the presentation of a work of visual art: because the public presentation exception addresses itself only to \"plop-art\", that is, those works of art subject to temporary changes in such matters as lighting and placement, and declares further that such modifications of a work of visual art are not \"destroying, distorting, or mutilating\" them, the public presentation exception does not apply to site-specific art, which, as everyone acknowledges, cannot be removed from its location without destroying it. This approach leaves Phillips with the district court's holding that VARA applies to site-specific art, minus the court's related holding that the public presentation exception permits the removal of such art. In this way, the tension that we identified in the district court's decision disappears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Dual regime</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With his position on VARA and the public presentation exception, Phillips argues that VARA essentially creates a dual regime &#8212; words that mean one thing as applied to non-site-specific art have a different meaning when applied to site-specific art. Beyond his reading of the public presentation exception itself, Phillips cites only one other provision of VARA in support of his dual regime argument &#8212; &#167; 113(d)(1)(A) of VARA, the so-called \"building exception\", which excludes from VARA's protection \"a work of visual art [that] has been incorporated or made a part of a building in such a way that removing the work from the building will cause the destruction, distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work as described in section 106A(a)(3).\" Phillips asserts that because VARA provides an exception to VARA for artwork attached to buildings, but does not contain a similar provision for site-specific art (understood as art attached to real property), VARA must protect site-specific art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With both the public presentation and building exceptions, Phillips is arguing that VARA's silence on a subject is actually evidence that the statute addresses that subject. To say the least, this is an odd way to read a statute. If VARA actually established such a complicated, dual regime, we would expect that the phrase \"site-specific\", or some equivalent, would appear in the language of the statute. There is no such phrase anywhere. Indeed, we would expect much more than just a reference to site-specific art. We would expect an elaboration of how to differentiate between site-specific and non-site-specific art (plop-art). That elaboration is nowhere to be found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the creation of a dual regime &#8212; which would require us, essentially, to rewrite VARA &#8212; has potentially far-reaching effects beyond the protection of Phillips' work in the Park. Once a piece of art is considered site-specific, and protected by VARA, such objects could not be altered by the property owner absent consent of the artist. Such a conclusion could dramatically affect real property interests and laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, as Pembroke argues in its brief, Phillips' work in the Park \"lies within a rapidly changing urban area and extends beyond Eastport Park to Boston Harbor.\" If a dual regime were created, there is the potential that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">not only would Pembroke's ability to move [Phillips'] work or alter Eastport Park be subject to Phillips' approval, but also the owners of nearby property who had nothing to do with the purchase or installation of Phillips' works would be subject to claims that what they do with <i>their</i> property has somehow affected the site and has, as a result, altered or destroyed Phillips' works.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In discussing the possibility of MAPA protecting site-specific art, the SJC echoed this concern, observing that the creation of a dual regime under MAPA \"would entail a radical consequence for owners of land, that the Legislature directly averted for owners of buildings. Specifically, rights afforded artists would encumber private and public land with restrictions lasting for the life of the artist plus fifty years, without the need for such restrictions to be recorded in a registry of deeds.\" <i>Phillips II,</i> 819 N.E.2d at 584-85. The SJC ultimately refused to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">read such an intent into a legislative act given the recognized legislative policy of disparaging land restrictions (especially unrecorded ones), the common-law doctrine disapproving the long-term burdening of property, and the corollary judicial practice of construing statutory provisions regarding land restrictions in favor of freedom of alienation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 585 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has also emphasized the principle that \"statutes which invade the common law are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.\" <i>United States v.

VARA does not protect site-specific art and then permit its destruction by removal from its site pursuant to the statute's public presentation exception.
