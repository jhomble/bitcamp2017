In    1997,    Austin    Smith   was\n\nconvicted in Massachusetts Superior Court of six counts of sexual\n\nassault on a minor and was sentenced to eighteen to twenty years in\n\nprison.    After exhausting his state court appeals, Smith             brought\n\na habeas petition in federal court, under 28 U.S.C. § 2254,\n\nalleging ineffective assistance of counsel at his state court\n\ntrial.     The district court below denied the habeas petition,\n\nadopting in full a magistrate judge's report and recommendation.\n\nAfter careful review of the record and finding no error, we affirm.\n\n            The   magistrate    judge's    detailed       report    includes   a\n\nthorough recitation of the facts of the case and we therefore do\n\nnot recount them in detail here.         Essentially, Smith was convicted\n\nof   repeatedly      sexually   assaulting       his   live-in     girlfriend's\n\ndaughter, Anna Garcia (a pseudonym), when she was five and six\n\nyears old.     The assaults occurred between December 1993 and May\n\n1995.    Initially, Anna did not tell anyone of the sexual abuse.              In\n\nJune 1995, Anna's aunt made a report of child abuse and neglect to\n\nthe Framingham, Massachusetts police department, alleging that Anna\n\nand her younger brother (who was the biological son of Anna's\n\nmother and Smith) were being physically abused by Smith. Following\n\nup on the report, a Massachusetts Department of Social Services\n\ninvestigator, James Nally, interviewed Anna and she revealed to\n\nNally for the first time that Smith had also sexually abused her.\n\nAfter the interview and while Nally was still present, Anna then\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\ftold her mother of the sexual abuse.               After the Nally interview was\n\nover, Anna's mother took Anna to see a pediatrician, Dr. Nancy\n\nRosselot, and Anna described the sexual abuse to her as well.                        At\n\nsome later point, Anna also told her aunt and grandmother what\n\nSmith had done to her.\n\n               At trial, the prosecution presented three key witnesses,\n\nAnna,1 Nally, and Dr. Rosselot.                 Under Massachusetts law at the\n\ntime,     Nally      and    Dr.   Rosselot     qualified   as    \"fresh      complaint\n\nwitnesses,\" meaning that they could testify to \"an out-of-court\n\ncomplaint seasonably made by the victim after [the] sexual assault\"\n\nand     such    testimony         would   be     \"admissible    as    part    of    the\n\nprosecution's case-in-chief.\"              Commonwealth v. Licata, 412 Mass.\n\n654, 657 (1992).           In addition, under the law as it stood at that\n\ntime, \"[a] fresh complaint witness [could] testify to the details\n\nof acts discussed during a fresh complaint; the acts about which\n\nthe witness testifie[d], however, must have been testified to by\n\nthe complainant.\"            Commonwealth v. Flebotte, 417 Mass. 348, 351\n\n(1994).        The \"fresh complaint doctrine\" also put a significant\n\nlimitation      on    how    such    evidence     could   be   used   by   the     jury:\n\n\"Evidence of the complaint is admissible only to corroborate the\n\ncomplainant's testimony; it cannot be presented to establish the\n\ntruth of the complaint itself.\"                Licata, 412 Mass. at 657.\n\n\n      1\n      At the time of trial, Anna was eight years old. Tragically,\nshe passed away two years after the trial, due to complications\nfrom strep throat.\n\n                                           -3-\n\f               Smith did not present any witnesses at trial. His theory\n\nof the case was that Anna had been coached by her mother, aunt, and\n\ngrandmother to fabricate the sexual abuse allegations because they\n\nhad an on-going feud with Smith.            His trial counsel sought to\n\nhighlight inconsistencies within Anna's testimony, inconsistencies\n\nbetween her testimony and what she previously told Nally and Dr.\n\nRosselot, and the lack of physical evidence supporting Anna's\n\nclaim.\n\n               Smith's ineffective assistance of counsel claim focuses\n\non four aspects of his counsel's conduct during the trial.            First,\n\nSmith argues that his trial counsel mishandled Anna's cross-\n\nexamination by asking her detailed questions about what she told\n\nNally    and    Dr.   Rosselot   about   Smith's   abuse.     This   line   of\n\nquestioning,       presumably    intended   to   uncover    inconsistencies,\n\nelicited graphic testimony from Anna about the details of Smith's\n\nabuse. Second, Smith argues that the cross-examination of Anna was\n\nalso constitutionally deficient because counsel asked Anna about\n\nwhat she told her mother, aunt, and grandmother about Smith's\n\nabuse.     Smith says this was prejudicial error because Anna's\n\nstatements to her relatives about the abuse had not been presented\n\nby the government in its case-in-chief, and therefore this line of\n\nquestioning introduced new and damning fresh complaint testimony\n\nthat otherwise would not have been before the jury.            Third, Smith\n\nargues that counsel's cross-examination of Nally and Dr. Rosselot\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fwas deficient because he repeatedly asked them to describe what\n\nAnna had told them about Smith's actions.            This elicited further\n\nrepetitive statements describing in graphic detail Smith's abuse.\n\nFourth, Smith condemns his counsel's failure to request a limiting\n\ninstruction indicating that Anna's testimony about her out-of-court\n\nstatements to others could not be used as substantive evidence of\n\nthe truth of her allegations.\n\n           Smith   first   raised    his   ineffective   assistance       claim\n\nbefore   the   Massachusetts   Appeals      Court,    which    affirmed    his\n\nconviction and denied his motion for a new trial.             Thereafter, the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied Smith's application for\n\nleave to obtain further appellate review, leaving the Appeals Court\n\ndecision as the final state adjudication of the claim. The Appeals\n\nCourt concluded that Smith's trial counsel's performance \"fell\n\nmeasurably below that of the ordinary fallible lawyer,\" because\n\ncounsel \"repeatedly elicit[ed] corroborative testimony from the\n\nvictim and other witnesses.\"        Commonwealth v. Smith, No. 99-P-766,\n\n2001 WL 695108, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 1116 (June 20, 2001) (unpublished\n\ntable decision).    However, the court concluded that, on the record\n\nas a whole, this deficient representation did not \"'cast doubt on\n\nthe validity of the jury's verdict.'\" Id. (quoting Commonwealth v.\n\nPeters, 429 Mass. 22, 33 (1999)).\n\n           Smith subsequently filed a habeas petition in federal\n\ncourt under 28 U.S.C. § 2254.        Agreeing with a magistrate judge's\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\freport and recommendation, the district court denied the writ,\n\nconcluding     that   the     Massachusetts   Appeals      Court   did   not\n\nunreasonably    apply   the    law    governing   claims   of   ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. The magistrate report, which was adopted in\n\nfull by the district court, explained its reasoning as follows:\n\n          Having read the entire trial record, it is just\n          as probable that the jury would have found Anna\n          credible based solely on the testimony which was\n          properly admitted. Put another way, there is not\n          a reasonable probability that the erroneously\n          admitted evidence would have altered the result.\n\n          The reason for this conclusion is that although\n          erroneously    admitted,    the   evidence    was\n          essentially cumulative. Anna testified that she\n          gave substantially the same recitation of facts\n          to all of the people to whom she reported the\n          abuse.    The Court might feel differently if\n          within the evidence which was erroneously\n          admitted, there was some important evidence\n          necessary    for   conviction   or    which   was\n          particularly weighty in favor of conviction which\n          was not otherwise before the jury in the form of\n          properly admitted evidence. But there is no such\n          evidence.\n\n\nIn other words, the court below denied the writ on prejudice\n\ngrounds, concluding that the state court did not unreasonably apply\n\nthe law regarding ineffective assistance given that there was no\n\nreasonable probability that without the deficient representation\n\nthe jury would have found in Smith's favor.\n\n          On a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, we review the\n\ndistrict court's legal conclusions de novo.          Teti v. Bender, 507\n\nF.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2007).         We will only grant the writ as to a\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fclaim adjudicated on the merits in state court if the adjudication\n\nof the claim \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n\ninvolved    an   unreasonable    application      of,   clearly    established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates.\"    28 U.S.C. § 2254 (d)(1).         Smith argues that the state\n\ncourt    unreasonably   applied    federal    law     regarding    ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel in finding that his counsel's errors were not\n\nprejudicial.       We   have    previously     held     that   a   finding    of\n\n\"unreasonable application\" requires more than \"the mere fact that\n\nthere was some error or that the state decision was incorrect.\"\n\nMcCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 36 (1st Cir. 2002).                    Indeed,\n\n\"'some increment of incorrectness beyond error is required.'\"                Id.\n\n(quoting Francis S. v. Stone, 221 F.3d 100, 111 (2d Cir. 2000)).\n\n            A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a\n\nshowing    that,   \"counsel's     conduct    so     undermined     the   proper\n\nfunctioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be\n\nrelied on as having produced a just result.\"                   Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 686 (1984).             A successful claim under\n\nStrickland requires two showings.           First, a defendant must show\n\nthat counsel's performance was deficient, meaning that \"counsel\n\nmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the\n\n'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\" Id. at\n\n687.    Second, a defendant must show that the deficient performance\n\nprejudiced the defense, which \"requires showing that counsel's\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\ferrors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,\n\na trial whose result is reliable.\"              Id.\n\n            The Massachusetts Appeals Court correctly applied what\n\nhas been held to be the functional equivalent of the two-part\n\nStrickland test to evaluate Smith's ineffective assistance claim.2\n\nBecause that court found that counsel's performance was indeed\n\nconstitutionally       deficient,    we     need    only   examine   the   court's\n\nevaluation    of   the   second     prong      of   Strickland,    the   prejudice\n\nquestion.    But, because this case reaches us on habeas review, we\n\ndo not evaluate whether the errors actually prejudiced Smith, but\n\nonly whether the Appeals Court reached an unreasonable conclusion\n\non   the   prejudice     question.        We    hold   that   it   did   not,   for\n\nsubstantially the reasons highlighted in the magistrate's report.\n\n            First, during the cross-examination of Anna by Smith's\n\ntrial counsel, she was asked about her out-of-court statements to\n\nNally and Dr. Rosselot, as well as to her mother, aunt, and\n\ngrandmother.       While this line of questioning certainly elicited\n\ndamning and graphic testimony regarding Smith's actions, it was\n\nessentially cumulative of Anna's prior testimony. Anna had already\n\nproperly testified about her statements to Nally and Dr. Rosselot,\n\n\n      2\n      In considering Smith's claim, the Massachusetts Appeals Court\napplied the Massachusetts standard for ineffective assistance of\ncounsel laid out in Commonwealth v. Saferian, 366 Mass. 89, 96\n(1974).    We have previously held that \"'for habeas purposes,\nSaferian is a functional equivalent of Strickland.'\" Malone v.\nClark, 536 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Ouber v. Guarino,\n293 F.3d 19, 32 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n                                       -8-\n\fand the statements Anna recounted making to her relatives were not\n\nsubstantially different from those she reported making to Nally and\n\nDr.   Rosselot.     It    is   true   that   trial   counsel's      questioning\n\npermitted Anna to recount the graphic content of these statements\n\nseveral times, and such repetition could, in some cases, be so\n\nsignificant as to undermine a defendant's right to a fair trial.\n\nSee Dugas v. Coplan, 428 F.3d 317, 335 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Strickland\n\nclearly allows the court to consider the cumulative effect of\n\ncounsel's    errors      in    determining     whether    a   defendant    was\n\nprejudiced.\") (quoting Kubat v. Thieret, 867 F.2d 351, 370 (7th\n\nCir. 1989)).      But here, the merely cumulative nature of the\n\nerroneously admitted evidence combined with the strength of the\n\nprosecution's     properly      admitted     evidence    --   the   compelling\n\ntestimony from the young victim and two fresh complaint witnesses\n\n-- leads us to conclude that the Appeals Court's determination of\n\n'no prejudice' was not an unreasonable application of Strickland.\n\n            Second, as to counsel's cross-examination of Nally and\n\nDr. Rosselot regarding what Anna told them about Smith's actions,\n\nwe similarly conclude that such testimony was cumulative of the\n\nwitnesses' primary testimony about their interviews with Anna.\n\nAgain, the Appeals Court's 'no prejudice' determination was not\n\nunreasonable.\n\n            Finally, as to counsel's failure to request a limiting\n\ninstruction regarding the fresh complaint testimony, the Appeals\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fCourt's determination of 'no prejudice' was not unreasonable given\n\nthat the trial court instructed the jury on three occasions3 about\n\nthe    nature    of    fresh    complaint     evidence      and    its    limited\n\napplicability.\n\n              Smith argues that the district court erroneously denied\n\nthe writ because it failed to recognize the \"serious weaknesses\" in\n\nthe prosecution's case. In other words, he argues that without the\n\nimproperly admitted evidence, the jury would likely have returned\n\na verdict of acquittal, meaning his counsel's errors did indeed\n\ncause him prejudice. However, the supposed \"weaknesses\" that Smith\n\npoints out -- the lack of physical evidence of sexual abuse, and\n\nsome very minor inconsistencies in Anna's recounting of Smith's\n\nabuse -- are not significant when weighed against the detailed and\n\ngenerally consistent testimony of Anna, Nally, and Dr. Rosselot.\n\nWe    agree   with    the   court   below   that   \"there   is    no   reasonable\n\nprobability the result would have been different\" had the jury not\n\nheard the improperly admitted evidence.\n\n              For the foregoing reasons we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of the writ of habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      The court gave these limiting instructions prior to the\ntestimony of Nally and Dr. Rosselot and during the court's final\ninstructions to the jury.\n\n                                       -10-\n\f",

In addition, under the law as it stood at that\n\ntime, \"[a] fresh complaint witness [could] testify to the details\n\nof acts discussed during a fresh complaint; the acts about which\n\nthe witness testifie[d], however, must have been testified to by\n\nthe complainant.\"            Commonwealth v.

The \"fresh complaint doctrine\" also put a significant\n\nlimitation      on    how    such    evidence     could   be   used   by   the     jury:\n\n\"Evidence of the complaint is admissible only to corroborate the\n\ncomplainant's testimony; it cannot be presented to establish the\n\ntruth of the complaint itself.\"                Licata, 412 Mass. at 657.\n\n\n      1\n      At the time of trial, Anna was eight years old. Tragically,\nshe passed away two years after the trial, due to complications\nfrom strep throat.\n\n                                           -3-\n\f               Smith did not present any witnesses at trial. His theory\n\nof the case was that Anna had been coached by her mother, aunt, and\n\ngrandmother to fabricate the sexual abuse allegations because they\n\nhad an on-going feud with Smith.            His trial counsel sought to\n\nhighlight inconsistencies within Anna's testimony, inconsistencies\n\nbetween her testimony and what she previously told Nally and Dr.\n\nRosselot, and the lack of physical evidence supporting Anna's\n\nclaim.\n\n               Smith's ineffective assistance of counsel claim focuses\n\non four aspects of his counsel's conduct during the trial.            First,\n\nSmith argues that his trial counsel mishandled Anna's cross-\n\nexamination by asking her detailed questions about what she told\n\nNally    and    Dr.   Rosselot   about   Smith's   abuse.     This   line   of\n\nquestioning,       presumably    intended   to   uncover    inconsistencies,\n\nelicited graphic testimony from Anna about the details of Smith's\n\nabuse. Second, Smith argues that the cross-examination of Anna was\n\nalso constitutionally deficient because counsel asked Anna about\n\nwhat she told her mother, aunt, and grandmother about Smith's\n\nabuse.     Smith says this was prejudicial error because Anna's\n\nstatements to her relatives about the abuse had not been presented\n\nby the government in its case-in-chief, and therefore this line of\n\nquestioning introduced new and damning fresh complaint testimony\n\nthat otherwise would not have been before the jury.            Third, Smith\n\nargues that counsel's cross-examination of Nally and Dr. Rosselot\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fwas deficient because he repeatedly asked them to describe what\n\nAnna had told them about Smith's actions.            This elicited further\n\nrepetitive statements describing in graphic detail Smith's abuse.\n\nFourth, Smith condemns his counsel's failure to request a limiting\n\ninstruction indicating that Anna's testimony about her out-of-court\n\nstatements to others could not be used as substantive evidence of\n\nthe truth of her allegations.\n\n           Smith   first   raised    his   ineffective   assistance       claim\n\nbefore   the   Massachusetts   Appeals      Court,    which    affirmed    his\n\nconviction and denied his motion for a new trial.             Thereafter, the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied Smith's application for\n\nleave to obtain further appellate review, leaving the Appeals Court\n\ndecision as the final state adjudication of the claim. The Appeals\n\nCourt concluded that Smith's trial counsel's performance \"fell\n\nmeasurably below that of the ordinary fallible lawyer,\" because\n\ncounsel \"repeatedly elicit[ed] corroborative testimony from the\n\nvictim and other witnesses.\"        Commonwealth v.

App. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1116</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (June 20, 2001) (unpublished\n\ntable decision).    However, the court concluded that, on the record\n\nas a whole, this deficient representation did not \"'cast doubt on\n\nthe validity of the jury's verdict.'\" Id. (quoting Commonwealth v.\n\nPeters, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (1999)).\n\n           Smith subsequently filed a habeas petition in federal\n\ncourt under 28 U.S.C. § 2254.        Agreeing with a magistrate judge's\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\freport and recommendation, the district court denied the writ,\n\nconcluding     that   the     Massachusetts   Appeals      Court   did   not\n\nunreasonably    apply   the    law    governing   claims   of   ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. The magistrate report, which was adopted in\n\nfull by the district court, explained its reasoning as follows:\n\n          Having read the entire trial record, it is just\n          as probable that the jury would have found Anna\n          credible based solely on the testimony which was\n          properly admitted. Put another way, there is not\n          a reasonable probability that the erroneously\n          admitted evidence would have altered the result.\n\n          The reason for this conclusion is that although\n          erroneously    admitted,    the   evidence    was\n          essentially cumulative. Anna testified that she\n          gave substantially the same recitation of facts\n          to all of the people to whom she reported the\n          abuse.    The Court might feel differently if\n          within the evidence which was erroneously\n          admitted, there was some important evidence\n          necessary    for   conviction   or    which   was\n          particularly weighty in favor of conviction which\n          was not otherwise before the jury in the form of\n          properly admitted evidence. But there is no such\n          evidence.\n\n\nIn other words, the court below denied the writ on prejudice\n\ngrounds, concluding that the state court did not unreasonably apply\n\nthe law regarding ineffective assistance given that there was no\n\nreasonable probability that without the deficient representation\n\nthe jury would have found in Smith's favor.\n\n          On a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, we review the\n\ndistrict court's legal conclusions de novo.          Teti v. Bender, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203020\"><a href=\"/opinion/203020/teti-v-bender/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (1st Cir. 2007).         We will only grant the writ as to a\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fclaim adjudicated on the merits in state court if the adjudication\n\nof the claim \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n\ninvolved    an   unreasonable    application      of,   clearly    established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates.\"    28 U.S.C. § 2254 (d)(1).         Smith argues that the state\n\ncourt    unreasonably   applied    federal    law     regarding    ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel in finding that his counsel's errors were not\n\nprejudicial.       We   have    previously     held     that   a   finding    of\n\n\"unreasonable application\" requires more than \"the mere fact that\n\nthere was some error or that the state decision was incorrect.\"\n\nMcCambridge v.

Indeed,\n\n\"'some increment of incorrectness beyond error is required.'\"                Id.\n\n(quoting Francis S. v.

A successful claim under\n\nStrickland requires two showings.           First, a defendant must show\n\nthat counsel's performance was deficient, meaning that \"counsel\n\nmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the\n\n'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\" Id. at\n\n687.    Second, a defendant must show that the deficient performance\n\nprejudiced the defense, which \"requires showing that counsel's\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\ferrors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,\n\na trial whose result is reliable.\"              Id.\n\n            The Massachusetts Appeals Court correctly applied what\n\nhas been held to be the functional equivalent of the two-part\n\nStrickland test to evaluate Smith's ineffective assistance claim.2\n\nBecause that court found that counsel's performance was indeed\n\nconstitutionally       deficient,    we     need    only   examine   the   court's\n\nevaluation    of   the   second     prong      of   Strickland,    the   prejudice\n\nquestion.    But, because this case reaches us on habeas review, we\n\ndo not evaluate whether the errors actually prejudiced Smith, but\n\nonly whether the Appeals Court reached an unreasonable conclusion\n\non   the   prejudice     question.        We    hold   that   it   did   not,   for\n\nsubstantially the reasons highlighted in the magistrate's report.\n\n            First, during the cross-examination of Anna by Smith's\n\ntrial counsel, she was asked about her out-of-court statements to\n\nNally and Dr. Rosselot, as well as to her mother, aunt, and\n\ngrandmother.       While this line of questioning certainly elicited\n\ndamning and graphic testimony regarding Smith's actions, it was\n\nessentially cumulative of Anna's prior testimony. Anna had already\n\nproperly testified about her statements to Nally and Dr. Rosselot,\n\n\n      2\n      In considering Smith's claim, the Massachusetts Appeals Court\napplied the Massachusetts standard for ineffective assistance of\ncounsel laid out in Commonwealth v. Saferian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088278\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088278/commonwealth-v-saferian/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96\n(1974).

It    is   true   that   trial   counsel's      questioning\n\npermitted Anna to recount the graphic content of these statements\n\nseveral times, and such repetition could, in some cases, be so\n\nsignificant as to undermine a defendant's right to a fair trial.\n\nSee Dugas v. Coplan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201898\"><a href=\"/opinion/201898/dugas-v-coplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Strickland\n\nclearly allows the court to consider the cumulative effect of\n\ncounsel's    errors      in    determining     whether    a   defendant    was\n\nprejudiced.\") (quoting Kubat v. Thieret, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518139\"><a href=\"/opinion/518139/robert-kubat-cross-appellee-v-james-thieret-warden-and-neil-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370 (7th\n\nCir. 1989)).      But here, the merely cumulative nature of the\n\nerroneously admitted evidence combined with the strength of the\n\nprosecution's     properly      admitted     evidence    --   the   compelling\n\ntestimony from the young victim and two fresh complaint witnesses\n\n-- leads us to conclude that the Appeals Court's determination of\n\n'no prejudice' was not an unreasonable application of Strickland.\n\n            Second, as to counsel's cross-examination of Nally and\n\nDr. Rosselot regarding what Anna told them about Smith's actions,\n\nwe similarly conclude that such testimony was cumulative of the\n\nwitnesses' primary testimony about their interviews with Anna.\n\nAgain, the Appeals Court's 'no prejudice' determination was not\n\nunreasonable.\n\n            Finally, as to counsel's failure to request a limiting\n\ninstruction regarding the fresh complaint testimony, the Appeals\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fCourt's determination of 'no prejudice' was not unreasonable given\n\nthat the trial court instructed the jury on three occasions3 about\n\nthe    nature    of    fresh    complaint     evidence      and    its    limited\n\napplicability.\n\n              Smith argues that the district court erroneously denied\n\nthe writ because it failed to recognize the \"serious weaknesses\" in\n\nthe prosecution's case. In other words, he argues that without the\n\nimproperly admitted evidence, the jury would likely have returned\n\na verdict of acquittal, meaning his counsel's errors did indeed\n\ncause him prejudice. However, the supposed \"weaknesses\" that Smith\n\npoints out -- the lack of physical evidence of sexual abuse, and\n\nsome very minor inconsistencies in Anna's recounting of Smith's\n\nabuse -- are not significant when weighed against the detailed and\n\ngenerally consistent testimony of Anna, Nally, and Dr. Rosselot.\n\nWe    agree   with    the   court   below   that   \"there   is    no   reasonable\n\nprobability the result would have been different\" had the jury not\n\nheard the improperly admitted evidence.\n\n              For the foregoing reasons we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of the writ of habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      The court gave these limiting instructions prior to the\ntestimony of Nally and Dr. Rosselot and during the court's final\ninstructions to the jury.\n\n                                       -10-\n\f</pre>",
