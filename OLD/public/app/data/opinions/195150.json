Plaintiffs  allege  that\n\nfederal law  preempts PUC's  inquiries.   The district  court\n\ndismissed the suit  for lack of subject  matter jurisdiction.\n\nConcluding that the case presents a federal question, we find\n\njurisdiction,  but  affirm the  dismissal  because plaintiffs\n\nfailed to state a cognizable claim. \n\n                              I.\n\n                          Background   \n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          Plaintiffs are non-utility power producers known as\n\n\"qualifying   small   power    production   facilities\"   and\n\n\"qualifying  cogeneration  facilities\"  (collectively \"QFs\"),\n\nsee 16  U.S.C.    796(17)(C), (18)(B).   QFs  are a  class of\n   \n\nfacilities,  defined by their size, fuel use, efficiency, and\n\n                    \n\n1.  Throughout  this opinion, we use the term \"plaintiffs\" to\ninclude the plaintiffs-intervenors,  Energy Tactics, Inc. and\nAmerican Hydro,  Inc.-Peterborough, as  well as  the original\nplaintiffs:     Bristol  Energy   Corp.;  Bio-Energy   Corp.;\nBridgewater  Power Co., L.P.;  Hemphill Power and  Light Co.;\nPinetree Power, Inc.;  Pinetree Power-Tamworth, Inc.;  Timco,\nInc.; and Whitefield Power and Light Company.  The complaints\nof these parties are identical in all relevant respects.  \n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nownership, see FERC v. Mississippi,  456 U.S. 742, 750 &amp; n.11\n                                  \n\n(1982), entitled to special treatment under federal and state\n\nlaws  regulating  power producers.    See 16  U.S.C.    824a-\n                                         \n\n3(e)(1);  18  C.F.R.    292.602(c)(1).    The  Federal Energy\n\nRegulatory   Commission   (FERC)    promulgates   regulations\n\naffecting  QFs.  State utility regulatory commissions such as\n\nPUC implement FERC's  regulations on the purchases  and sales\n\nof power between utilities and QFs. \n\n          In  passing  the  legislation  authorizing  special\n\nrules  for QFs, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of\n\n1978 (PURPA),  Congress viewed QFs  as desirable alternatives\n\nto traditional electric  utility generating facilities.   See\n                                                             \n\nFERC, 456 U.S. at  750.  At that time, Congress perceived two\n    \n\nimpediments to QF development:  [1] the reluctance  of public\n\nutilities  to sell power to  and buy power  from QFs; and [2]\n\nthe  financial burdens imposed  on QFs  by state  and federal\n\nlaws designed to regulate utilities providing  electricity to\n\nthe public.   See  id.  at 750-51.    To overcome  the  first\n                      \n\nimpediment,   Congress   mandated    that   FERC   promulgate\n\nregulations, for states to implement, governing  transactions\n\nbetween  utilities  and  QFs, including  a  requirement  that\n\nutilities purchase electricity  from QFs at a rate  up to the\n\nutility's  avoided cost  (i.e.,  the  utility's  cost  if  it\n                              \n\ngenerated  the power  itself, or  purchased  it from  another\n\nsource).  See 16 U.S.C.   824a-3(b), -3(d).  \n             \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          To  solve the  second problem,  Congress eased  the\n\nfinancial burdens  on QFs by  authorizing FERC to  exempt QFs\n\nfrom certain federal laws, and from state laws or regulations\n\n\"respecting  the  rates,  or  respecting  the  financial   or\n\norganizational   regulation,  of   electric  utilities,\"   if\n\nnecessary  to  encourage QFs.    Id.     824a-3(e).    FERC's\n                                    \n\nexemptions for QFs  are codified at 18 C.F.R.     292.601 and\n\n.602.   Plaintiffs allege  that PUC's business  and financial\n\ndisclosure order violates  the regulation exempting QFs  from\n\nstate regulation of the finances and organization of electric\n\nutilities.   See  id.    292.602(c)(1)(ii)  (hereinafter  \"QF\n                     \n\nexemption\").\n\n          On  April 16,  1993, PUC  commenced  proceedings to\n\nperform  a study of wholesale power  supplies required by the\n\nEnergy  Policy Act  of 1992,  16 U.S.C.    2621(d)(10).2   In\n\nconnection with its study, PUC sent detailed data requests to\n\neighty  QFs in New  Hampshire, including  plaintiffs, seeking\n\ndetailed disclosures offinancial and proprietaryinformation.3\n\n                    \n\n2.  Congress  passed the Energy Policy  Act in part to foster\ngreater competition in the wholesale power production market.\nSee generally H.R. Rep. No. 474(I), 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 138-\n             \n40 (1992), reprinted in 1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1953, 1961-63.\n                       \n\n3.  Plaintiffs characterize these requests as inquiries into:\n          [1]  each facility's business form and ownership; \n          [2]  plaintiff's  financing  agreements,  including\n          the identity of  the lender, and the amount  of the\n          loan, its  rate of interest, any required operating\n          reserve, and the priority of creditors;\n          [3]  plaintiff's retired debt;\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          On June 14, 1993, plaintiffs filed an action in the\n\nUnited   States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  New\n\nHampshire,   alleging  that  they   were  exempt  from  PUC's\n\ninquiries, pursuant  to FERC's QF  exemption.  They  sought a\n\ndeclaratory  judgment and an  injunction to prevent  PUC from\n\nenforcing its disclosure orders.  PUC countered that, because\n\nthe QF exemption  does not apply to PUC's  data requests, the\n\ncomplaint failed to state a  claim upon which relief could be\n\ngranted.4  \n\n          On July  20,  1993, the  district  court  dismissed\n\nplaintiffs' action sua sponte, stating that it lacked subject\n                             \n\nmatter jurisdiction.    In  denying  plaintiffs'  motion  for\n\nreconsideration, the district court ruled:  \n\n                    \n\n          [4]  allocations   of   income,    gains,   losses,\n          distributions, credit,  and cash, from  the closing\n          of any construction loans through the present; \n          [5]  the  form of sales of power, monthly volume of\n          electricity generated,  and the  identity of  their\n          customers; and \n          [6]  each facility's fuel use, including heat rate,\n          price paid for fuel, projected fuel use through the\n          year  2000,  method  of fuel  transportation,  fuel\n          storage  capacity,  and  fuel  use risk  management\n          strategies.\nPUC's  data requests  also seek  copies  of plaintiffs'  fuel\nsupply  contracts and a  year-by-year spreadsheet analysis of\nfinancial  operations  from  the  commencement  of  operation\nthrough  the  year  2010.    Joint  Br.  for  Appellants  and\n                                                             \nI n t e r v e n o r s - A p p e l l a n t s    a t    4 - 5 .\n                                           \n\n4.  PUC did not file  a motion to dismiss under  Fed. R. Civ.\nP.  12(b)(6), but  alleged as  a defense  in its  answer that\nplaintiffs failed to state a cognizable claim.  \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          Assuming arguendo  that this  court could\n          exercise  jurisdiction  over  plaintiffs'\n          purported preemption claim  at this stage\n          in the process, there remain at least two\n          problems   with   plaintiffs'   argument.\n          First,  defendant's  data  requests  were\n          issued pursuant to federal law; i.e., the\n          Energy Policy  Act of  1992.   Therefore,\n          [FERC's  regulation  exempting  QFs  from\n          state regulation] is inapposite. . . .\n\nBristol Energy Corp. v. New Hampshire Pub. Utils. Comm'n, 827\n                                                        \n\nF.  Supp. 81,  83 (D.N.H.  1993).   Plaintiffs appealed.   By\n\norder of  this court dated  August 30, 1993, we  directed the\n\nparties to address the merits, as well as  the jurisdictional\n\nissue.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\nA.  Jurisdiction\n                \n\n          The  district court  ruled that  16  U.S.C.    2633\n\nstripped  it  of  jurisdiction.   That  statute  provides, in\n\npertinent part:  \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law,\n\nno court  of the United  States shall have  jurisdiction over\n\nany action arising  under [16 U.S.C.    2611 - 2634] . . . .\"\n\nThe authority PUC  cited for issuing its data  requests is 16\n\nU.S.C.    2621(d)(10).   Thus, we would  lack jurisdiction if\n\nthis case  were, in fact,  an \"action arising  under\" section\n\n2621(d)(10).\n\n          According to plaintiffs,  the district court looked\n\nat the wrong  \"action\" in deciding the  jurisdictional issue.\n\nAlthough  PUC  sent  out data  requests  pursuant  to section\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n2621(d)(10),  plaintiffs  argue  that   this  case  does  not\n\n\"aris[e]  under\" that section.  Rather, plaintiffs argue that\n\ntheir  cause of action  implicates principles  of preemption,\n\nrelating  to the  QF  exemption  and  the  Supremacy  Clause.\n\nPlaintiffs  maintain  that  this  preemption  claim  triggers\n\nfederal question jurisdiction.  We agree.  \n\n          \"It  is well  established  that  to invoke  federal\n\nquestion jurisdiction,  a federal  issue must  appear on  the\n\nface of a well pleaded complaint.\"  Cable Television Ass'n v.\n                                                          \n\nFinneran, 954 F.2d  91, 94 (2d Cir. 1992);  see also Colonial\n                                                             \n\nPenn Group  v.

Here, plaintiffs allege that FERC's QF exemption\n\nunder PURPA preempts PUC's authority under state law to order\n\nQFs   to  disclose   business   and  financial   information.\n\nPlaintiffs  seek  an  injunction, as  well  as  a declaratory\n\njudgment,  to prevent the enforcement of PUC's data requests.\n\nThis case is thus aligned with Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,\n                                                            \n\n463 U.S. 85 (1983), in which the Supreme Court noted:\n\n          It is beyond  dispute that federal courts\n          have  jurisdiction over  suits to  enjoin\n          state  officials  from  interfering  with\n          federal rights.

A plaintiff who\n          seeks   injunctive   relief   from  state\n          regulation,  on  the   ground  that  such\n          regulation  is  pre-empted by  a  federal\n          statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy\n          Clause of the Constitution, must prevail,\n          thus  presents a  federal question  which\n          the  federal  courts   have  jurisdiction\n          under 28 U.S.C.   1331 to resolve.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nShaw, 463 U.S. at 96 n.14; see also Playboy Enters. v.

Section  824a-3(g) places  limits  on federal\n\njurisdiction in  proceedings involving rules  implementing 16\n\nU.S.C.     824a-3(a) and  -3(f), rules not  at issue  in this\n\ncase.5    See id.     824a-3(g).   The  record  in this  case\n                 \n\nconfirms what PUC's counsel conceded at oral argument:  PUC's\n\ndata requests were  issued pursuant to both state  law and 16\n\nU.S.C.   2621(d)(10),  not under the  rules cited in  section\n\n824a-3(g).   We conclude  that federal question  jurisdiction\n\nexists in this case, as  in Shaw, because plaintiffs allege a\n                                \n\npreemption  claim and  seek to  enjoin  state officials  from\n\ninterfering with a federal right, i.e., the QF exemption.    \n                                      \n\nB.  Merits\n          \n\n          Plaintiffs have alleged  that they are  entitled to\n\ndeclaratory  and injunctive  relief because  PUC's  action is\n\npreempted  by federal  law.  The  federal law  that allegedly\n\npreempts  PUC's  inquiries   is  the  QF  exemption.     That\n\nregulation  provides  in  pertinent  part:   \"Any  qualifying\n\n                    \n\n5.

We  consider, seriatim, two issues:   [1]\n                                          \n\nwhether PUC's one-time  inquiry of QFs to  gather information\n\nfor  a study mandated by  16 U.S.C.   2621(d)(10) constitutes\n\nstate  \"regulation respecting  .  .  .  [t]he  financial  and\n\norganizational  regulation of  electric  utilities\"; and  [2]\n\nwhether  Congress  intended  state agencies  such  as  PUC to\n\nrequest information from  QFs to complete the  study mandated\n\nby 16 U.S.C.   2621(d)(10).\n\n1.  Are QFs Exempt from PUC's Inquiries?\n                                        \n\n          FERC, as an amicus in this case, argues that the QF\n\nexemption does  not preempt  PUC's inquiries  because PUC  is\n\nseeking  information on  a  one-time  basis,  to  complete  a\n\nfederally  mandated study of  wholesale power supplies.   See\n                                                             \n\nsection 712  of the Energy  Policy Act of  1992, 16  U.S.C.  \n\n2621(d)(10).  According to FERC, such a limited collection of\n\ninformation   for  a   federally  mandated  study   does  not\n\ncontravene the letter or the  spirit of the QF exemption from\n\nstate  \"regulation  respecting  .  .  .  the  financ[es]  and\n\norganization[]\" of QFs.  We agree.\n\n          FERC  promulgated  the  QF  exemption  pursuant  to\n\nCongress's  mandate   that   QFs  be   exempted  from   state\n\nregulations  on  the  rates,  finances,  and  organization of\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nelectric utilities, if FERC found such an exemption necessary\n\nto  encourage QF  power production.   See  16 U.S.C.    824a-\n                                         \n\n3(e)(1).   FERC takes the position that  its exemption allows\n\nQFs  to avoid \"utility-type\" regulation, 45 Fed. Reg. 12,214,\n\n12,232  (Feb. 25, 1980)  (preamble to final  rule), including\n\nstate  control  of  electricity   rates  and  the   finances,\n\ncapitalization, and organization of electric utilities.  \n\n          PUC's  inquiries are  not  preempted  by FERC's  QF\n\nexemption.  We  do not dispute that PUC  is seeking financial\n\nand organizational information  from plaintiffs.  And  we can\n\nvisualize circumstances  in which a  state agency's  standing\n\norder  requiring  periodic disclosures  of  financial records\n\nmight  be   part-and-parcel  of  the  control  over  electric\n\nutilities from which QFs are exempt.  See generally 18 C.F.R.\n                                                   \n\n  292.601(c)  (exempting QFs  from, inter  alia, 16 U.S.C.   \n                                               \n\n825(b)  (authorizing FERC to  have access  \"at all  times\" to\n\naccounts,  records, and memoranda  of public  utilities)); 44\n\nFed. Reg. 38,863,  38,865 (July 3,  1979) (FERC Staff  Paper)\n\n(noting that  FERC could  exempt QFs  from \"requirements  for\n\nfiling voluminous  reports  concerning  operating,  cost  and\n\nrevenue data\").  \n\n          But  PUC did not assert such plenary authority over\n\nQFs when it issued the document requests.  In fact, PUC cited\n\nonly  its  authority under  state  law and  the  necessity of\n\ncompleting  the evaluation  mandated by  section  712 of  the\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nEnergy Policy  Act,  16 U.S.C.     2621(d)(10).   The  record\n\nsuggests that PUC's inquiries seek information related to the\n\nfactors  enumerated in 16  U.S.C.   2621(d)(10)--assuming QFs\n\nare  proper sources  of  such information.    Because PUC  is\n\ngathering  data on  a  one-time basis  to  perform the  study\n\nmandated  by the Energy Policy  Act, 16 U.S.C.   2621(d)(10),\n\nthe QF exemption  is not a sound foundation  for a preemption\n\nclaim.  Such an inquiry  is not utility-type regulation.  Nor\n\ndoes the record suggest that the information will be used for\n\nutility-type regulation.\n\n2.  Did Congress Intend QFs To Be Included in the Study?\n                                                        \n\n          Plaintiffs argue that  Congress did not  intend QFs\n\nto be included in  the Energy Policy Act  study.  The  Energy\n\nPolicy  Act requires that  certain state agencies  perform \"a\n\ngeneral  evaluation\" of  four factors  relating to  wholesale\n\npower supplies:  [1] the impact of  long-term wholesale power\n\npurchases on  a utility's cost  of capital and  retail rates;\n\n[2] the effect of the debt-laden capital structure of \"exempt\n\nwholesale  generators\" on  utilities and on  reliability; [3]\n\nthe  propriety of  advance approval  for  long-term wholesale\n\npower purchase contracts; and [4] the need for assurances  of\n\nfuel supply  adequacy in  long-term wholesale  power purchase\n\ncontracts.6   See 16  U.S.C.   2621(d)(10)(A);  see generally\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n6.

PUC is\n      \n\nincluded in the  class of state agencies  required to perform\n\nthis study; that is, those requiring or allowing utilities to\n\npurchase long-term wholesale power supplies.  See 16 U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n          electric  utilities  for   which  it  has\n          ratemaking  authority  to   consider  the\n          purchase  of  long-term  wholesale  power\n          supplies as  a means of  meeting electric\n          demand,  such authority  shall perform  a\n          general evaluation of:  \n          (i)  the  potential   for  increases   or\n          decreases  in  the costs  of  capital for\n          such   utilities,   and   any   resulting\n          increases  or  decreases  in  the  retail\n          rates  paid by  electric consumers,  that\n          may  result from  purchases of  long-term\n          wholesale power  supplies in lieu  of the\n          construction of new generation facilities\n          by such utilities;\n          (ii) whether the use  by exempt wholesale\n          generators .  . .  of capital  structures\n          which   employ   proportionally   greater\n          amounts   of   debt  than   the   capital\n          structures  of  such  utilities threatens\n          reliability   or   provides   an   unfair\n          advantage for exempt wholesale generators\n          over such utilities;\n          (iii) whether to implement procedures for\n          the  advance approval  or disapproval  of\n          the  purchase of  a particular  long-term\n          wholesale power supply; and \n          (iv) whether  to require  as a  condition\n          for the approval of the purchase of power\n          that  there be  reasonable assurances  of\n          fuel supply adequacy.\n16 U.S.C.   2621(d)(10).  A state agency need not perform the\nevaluation  or implement any  procedures suggested by  it, if\nsuch  action  would   be  inconsistent  with  state   law  or\ninappropriate under PURPA.   See 16 U.S.C.   2621(a), (c)(1);\n                                \nFERC,  456  U.S. at  764-70.    PUC has  decided  that it  is\n    \nrequired to perform the study. \n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n2621(d)(10)(A).    The  statute  provides  that  states  must\n\n\"consider and make  a determination concerning whether  . . .\n\nto implement the[se]  standards\" by October 24, 1993.   Id.  \n                                                           \n\n2621(d)(10)(E).    \n\n          Plaintiffs maintain  that  the  Energy  Policy  Act\n\nstudy   concerns  only  a  new  class  of  non-utility  power\n\nproducers  called  \"exempt   wholesale  generators\"  (EWGs).7\n\nPlaintiffs  also  contend  that   the  only  power  producers\n\nintended by Congress  to be  subject to  PUC's inquiries  are\n\nEWGs, electric utilities, and certain affiliates of EWGs.  \n\n          The central  issue  is  whether  Congress  intended\n\nstate  agencies to  make inquiries of  QFs to  complete their\n\nevaluation of  wholesale power  supplies.  Considering  first\n\nthe language  of the statute  to be  construed, see  American\n                                                             \n\nTobacco Co.  v. Patterson,  456 U.S. 63,  68 (1982),  we note\n                         \n\nthat Congress mandated that agencies,  including PUC, perform\n\n\"a  general evaluation\" of  the enumerated factors respecting\n\nwholesale power supplies.     Although the  statute makes  no\n\nmention  of QFs,  the use  of  the term  \"general evaluation\"\n\nsuggests that the scope of the study is intended to be broad.\n\nOnly  the second factor--the impact of debt-laden EWG capital\n\nstructures on utilities and on reliability--explicitly refers\n\n                    \n\n7.  EWGs  are  so   called  because  they  are   entitled  to\nexemptions   from   certain  federal   utility   regulations,\nincluding ownership and capitalization restrictions under the\nPublic Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act.\nSee generally Watkiss &amp; Smith, supra, at 465 n.74, 467.\n                                    \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nto  EWGs; the  remaining three  factors  refer to  \"long-term\n\nwholesale power purchases.\"  It is undisputed that plaintiffs\n\nsupply  power at  wholesale  to  electric  utilities  in  New\n\nHampshire under  long-term contracts, and  that QFs  entering\n\nthe market in the future could enter into long-term contracts\n\nwith utilities in  the state.  The language  and structure of\n\nthe statute  indicate  that Congress  intended  QFs to  be  a\n\nsource of information.\n\n          Common sense reinforces this  conclusion.  Congress\n\nclearly intended the \"general evaluation\" of  wholesale power\n\nsupply issues to be meaningful and comprehensive,  especially\n\nbecause  the  Energy  Policy  Act  is  designed  to  increase\n\ncompetition  in the wholesale  power production market.   See\n                                                             \n\ngenerally H.R. Rep.  No. 474(I), supra, at  138-40, reprinted\n                                                             \n\nin  1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1961-63;  Watkiss &amp; Smith, supra, at\n                                                         \n\n449.  Nurtured by FERC's regulations and by PURPA since 1978,\n\nQFs have become an important source of power for utilities to\n\npurchase  at  wholesale.   For example,  there were  at least\n\neighty QFs operating in New  Hampshire in the spring of 1993.\n\nEWGs, in  contrast to  QFs, are a  new category  of wholesale\n\npower producer, created  by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  A\n\ncompany can become an EWG  only by filing an application with\n\nFERC.  See 15 U.S.C.   79z-5a(a)(1).  Accordingly, there were\n          \n\nno  EWGs in  existence when  Congress  enacted the  provision\n\nrequiring states to study wholesale power supply  issues.  We\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nare led inexorably  to the conclusion that  Congress intended\n\nstate  agencies to  gather data  from QFs,  because they  are\n\nsignificant  existing sources of wholesale power, in order to\n\nassess the present power situation  and to predict the impact\n\nof new entrants into the wholesale power market.\n\n          At  oral  argument, counsel  for  plaintiffs stated\n\nthat state  agencies could acquire information  regarding QFs\n\nfrom  third-party sources.   This  point does not  affect our\n\ndetermination that Congress intended states to make inquiries\n\nof QFs, so that the general evaluation of long-term wholesale\n\npower   purchases  would  be   meaningful.    No   source  of\n\ninformation  on  QFs would  be  as authoritative  as  the QFs\n\nthemselves.  If Congress  intended information regarding  QFs\n\nto be  part of the  Energy Policy  Act \"general  evaluation,\"\n\npresumably Congress intended  that QFs would be the source of\n\nthis information. \n\n          Plaintiffs'  next argument is  that section  714 of\n\nthe  Energy  Policy  Act, 16  U.S.C.     824(g)(1), manifests\n\nCongress's  intent that states cannot subject QFs to business\n\nand  financial inquiries.    Section  714  provides,  \"[u]pon\n\nwritten order  of a State commission, a  State commission may\n\nexamine  the  books,   accounts,  memoranda,  contracts,  and\n\nrecords of\" electric utilities, EWGs, and affiliates of EWGs.\n\n16 U.S.C.   824(g)(1).  Because Congress enacted both section\n\n714 and the provision mandating the study  of wholesale power\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nsupplies under the  Energy Policy Act, plaintiffs  argue that\n\nsection  714 limits  the scope  of  the \"general  evaluation\"\n\nrequired  by 16 U.S.C.    2621(d)(10) to  electric utilities,\n\nEWGs, and their affiliates. \n\n          Plaintiffs' argument  elevates a rule  of statutory\n\nconstruction--that  two  provisions of  the  same legislation\n\nmust be read together--above a  full and sensible reading  of\n\nthe  statutes at issue.   Section 714  specifically provides:\n\n\"Nothing in this section shall-- (A) preempt applicable State\n\nlaw  concerning   the   provision  of   records   and   other\n\ninformation; or (B) in any way limit rights to obtain records\n\nand  other  information  under  Federal  law,  contracts,  or\n\notherwise.\"  16  U.S.C.   824(g)(4).   That provision negates\n\nplaintiffs'  attempt  to  use the  facilities  enumerated  in\n\nsection  714  as   an  exclusive  list  of   power  producers\n\nsusceptible  to  state  data  requests  pursuant  to  section\n\n2621(d)(10).\n\n          Furthermore,  there  is   an  obvious  reason   why\n\nCongress would have omitted QFs from section 714, while still\n\nintending that QFs  respond to inquiries pursuant  to section\n\n2621(d)(10):    section  714  is  an  unrestricted  grant  of\n\nauthority.   The  statute provides  that a  state agency  may\n\nexamine  the  records   of  electric  utilities,  EWGs,   and\n\naffiliates of EWGs,  \"if such examination is required for the\n\neffective  discharge\"   of  the   agency's  \"responsibilities\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\naffecting  the provision of  electric service.\"   16 U.S.C.  \n\n824(g)(1).  The statute does not mention section 2621(d)(10),\n\nlet  alone limit  the exercise  of  this document  inspection\n\nauthority to gathering information for an evaluation of long-\n\nterm wholesale power supply purchases.  If QFs were among the\n\npower producers listed  in section 714,  a court could  infer\n\nCongress's intent  to repeal partially FERC's  QF exemptions,\n\nso  that QFs  would  be proper  subjects  of any  information\n\nrequests  by state agencies.   See Natural  Resources Defense\n                                                             \n\nCouncil  v.

We hold that PUC may\n\nmake  inquiries of  QFs on  a  one-time basis  because it  is\n\nacting to  complete a  study mandated by  federal law.   Such\n\nregulatory  action  is   not  a  state  \"law   or  regulation\n\nrespecting   .  .  .

Our  decision  does  not  alter  the  QF\n\nexemption.\n\n          In  light of the  foregoing, we  reject plaintiffs'\n\npreemption  claim.

Sec. 2621(d)(10).  Plaintiffs allege that federal law preempts PUC's inquiries.  The district court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Concluding that the case presents a federal question, we find jurisdiction, but affirm the dismissal because plaintiffs failed to state a cognizable claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs are non-utility power producers known as \"qualifying small power production facilities\" and \"qualifying cogeneration facilities\" (collectively \"QFs\"), see 16 U.S.C. Sec. 796(17)(C), (18)(B).  QFs are a class of facilities, defined by their size, fuel use, efficiency, and ownership, see FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742, 750 &amp; n. 11, 102 S.Ct. 2126, 2132 &amp; n. 11, 72 L.Ed.2d 532 (1982), entitled to special treatment under federal and state laws regulating power producers.  See 16 U.S.C. Sec. 824a-3(e)(1);  18 C.F.R. Sec. 292.602(c)(1).  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) promulgates regulations affecting QFs.  State utility regulatory commissions such as PUC implement FERC's regulations on the purchases and sales of power between utilities and QFs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In passing the legislation authorizing special rules for QFs, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), Congress viewed QFs as desirable alternatives to traditional electric utility generating facilities.  See FERC, 456 U.S. at 750, 102 S.Ct. at 2132. At that time, Congress perceived two impediments to QF development:   the reluctance of public utilities to sell power to and buy power from QFs;  and  the financial burdens imposed on QFs by state and federal laws designed to regulate utilities providing electricity to the public.  See id. at 750-51, 102 S.Ct. at 2132-34.   To overcome the first impediment, Congress mandated that FERC promulgate regulations, for states to implement, governing transactions between utilities and QFs, including a requirement that utilities purchase electricity from QFs at a rate up to the utility's avoided cost (i.e., the utility's cost if it generated the power itself, or purchased it from another source).  See 16 U.S.C. Sec. 824a-3(b), -3(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To solve the second problem, Congress eased the financial burdens on QFs by authorizing FERC to exempt QFs from certain federal laws, and from state laws or regulations \"respecting the rates, or respecting the financial or organizational regulation, of electric utilities,\" if necessary to encourage QFs.  Id. Sec. 824a-3(e).  FERC's exemptions for QFs are codified at 18 C.F.R. Secs. 292.601 and .602.  Plaintiffs allege that PUC's business and financial disclosure order violates the regulation exempting QFs from state regulation of the finances and organization of electric utilities.  See id. Sec. 292.602(c)(1)(ii) (hereinafter \"QF exemption\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 16, 1993, PUC commenced proceedings to perform a study of wholesale power supplies required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In connection with its study, PUC sent detailed data requests to eighty QFs in New Hampshire, including plaintiffs, seeking detailed disclosures of financial and proprietary information.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 14, 1993, plaintiffs filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, alleging that they were exempt from PUC's inquiries, pursuant to FERC's QF exemption.  They sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction to prevent PUC from enforcing its disclosure orders.  PUC countered that, because the QF exemption does not apply to PUC's data requests, the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 20, 1993, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' action sua sponte, stating that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.  In denying plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, the district court ruled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Assuming arguendo that this court could exercise jurisdiction over plaintiffs' purported preemption claim at this stage in the process, there remain at least two problems with plaintiffs' argument.  First, defendant's data requests were issued pursuant to federal law;  i.e., the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  Therefore, [FERC's regulation exempting QFs from state regulation] is inapposite....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bristol Energy Corp. v. New Hampshire Pub. Utils.  Comm'n, 827 F.Supp. 81, 83 (D.N.H.1993).  Plaintiffs appealed.  By order of this court dated August 30, 1993, we directed the parties to address the merits, as well as the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>A. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2633 stripped it of jurisdiction.  That statute provides, in pertinent part:  \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court of the United States shall have jurisdiction over any action arising under [16 U.S.C. Secs. 2611-2634]....\"  The authority PUC cited for issuing its data requests is 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10).  Thus, we would lack jurisdiction if this case were, in fact, an \"action arising under\" section 2621(d)(10).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to plaintiffs, the district court looked at the wrong \"action\" in deciding the jurisdictional issue.  Although PUC sent out data requests pursuant to section 2621(d)(10), plaintiffs argue that this case does not \"aris[e] under\" that section.  Rather, plaintiffs argue that their cause of action implicates principles of preemption, relating to the QF exemption and the Supremacy Clause.  Plaintiffs maintain that this preemption claim triggers federal question jurisdiction.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is well established that to invoke federal question jurisdiction, a federal issue must appear on the face of a well pleaded complaint.\"  Cable Television Ass'n v. Finneran, 954 F.2d 91, 94 (2d Cir.1992);  see also Colonial Penn Group v. Colonial Deposit Co., 834 F.2d 229, 233 (1st Cir.1987).  Here, plaintiffs allege that FERC's QF exemption under PURPA preempts PUC's authority under state law to order QFs to disclose business and financial information.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction, as well as a declaratory judgment, to prevent the enforcement of PUC's data requests.  This case is thus aligned with Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983), in which the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>It is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal rights.  See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 160-62 [28 S.Ct. 441, 454-55, 52 L.Ed. 714] (1908).  A plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation, on the ground that such regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must prevail, thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331 to resolve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shaw, 463 U.S. at 96 n. 14, 103 S.Ct. at 2899 n. 14;  see also Playboy Enters. v.

Sec. 824a-3(g) divests federal courts of jurisdiction.  Section 824a-3(g) places limits on federal jurisdiction in proceedings involving rules implementing 16 U.S.C. Secs. 824a-3(a) and -3(f), rules not at issue in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See id. Sec. 824a-3(g).  The record in this case confirms what PUC's counsel conceded at oral argument:  PUC's data requests were issued pursuant to both state law and 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10), not under the rules cited in section 824a-3(g).  We conclude that federal question jurisdiction exists in this case, as in Shaw, because plaintiffs allege a preemption claim and seek to enjoin state officials from interfering with a federal right, i.e., the QF exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs have alleged that they are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief because PUC's action is preempted by federal law.  The federal law that allegedly preempts PUC's inquiries is the QF exemption.  That regulation provides in pertinent part:  \"Any qualifying facility shall be exempted ... from State law or regulation respecting ... [t]he financial and organizational regulation of electric utilities.\"  18 C.F.R. Sec. 292.602(c)(1)(ii).  We consider, seriatim, two issues:   whether PUC's one-time inquiry of QFs to gather information for a study mandated by 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10) constitutes state \"regulation respecting ... [t]he financial and organizational regulation of electric utilities\";  and  whether Congress intended state agencies such as PUC to request information from QFs to complete the study mandated by 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>1. Are QFs Exempt from PUC's Inquiries?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FERC, as an amicus in this case, argues that the QF exemption does not preempt PUC's inquiries because PUC is seeking information on a one-time basis, to complete a federally mandated study of wholesale power supplies.  See section 712 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10).  According to FERC, such a limited collection of information for a federally mandated study does not contravene the letter or the spirit of the QF exemption from state \"regulation respecting ... the financ[es] and organization[ ]\" of QFs.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FERC promulgated the QF exemption pursuant to Congress's mandate that QFs be exempted from state regulations on the rates, finances, and organization of electric utilities, if FERC found such an exemption necessary to encourage QF power production.  See 16 U.S.C. Sec. 824a-3(e)(1).  FERC takes the position that its exemption allows QFs to avoid \"utility-type\" regulation, 45 Fed.Reg. 12,214, 12,232 (Feb. 25, 1980) (preamble to final rule), including state control of electricity rates and the finances, capitalization, and organization of electric utilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PUC's inquiries are not preempted by FERC's QF exemption.  We do not dispute that PUC is seeking financial and organizational information from plaintiffs.  And we can visualize circumstances in which a state agency's standing order requiring periodic disclosures of financial records might be part-and-parcel of the control over electric utilities from which QFs are exempt.  See generally 18 C.F.R. Sec. 292.601(c) (exempting QFs from, inter alia, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 825(b) (authorizing FERC to have access \"at all times\" to accounts, records, and memoranda of public utilities));  44 Fed.Reg. 38,863, 38,865 (July 3, 1979) (FERC Staff Paper) (noting that FERC could exempt QFs from \"requirements for filing voluminous reports concerning operating, cost and revenue data\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But PUC did not assert such plenary authority over QFs when it issued the document requests.  In fact, PUC cited only its authority under state law and the necessity of completing the evaluation mandated by section 712 of the Energy Policy Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10).  The record suggests that PUC's inquiries seek information related to the factors enumerated in 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10)--assuming QFs are proper sources of such information.  Because PUC is gathering data on a one-time basis to perform the study mandated by the Energy Policy Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10), the QF exemption is not a sound foundation for a preemption claim.  Such an inquiry is not utility-type regulation.  Nor does the record suggest that the information will be used for utility-type regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>2. Did Congress Intend QFs To Be Included in the Study?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that Congress did not intend QFs to be included in the Energy Policy Act study.  The Energy Policy Act requires that certain state agencies perform \"a general evaluation\" of four factors relating to wholesale power supplies:   the impact of long-term wholesale power purchases on a utility's cost of capital and retail rates;   the effect of the debt-laden capital structure of \"exempt wholesale generators\" on utilities and on reliability;   the propriety of advance approval for long-term wholesale power purchase contracts;  and  the need for assurances of fuel supply adequacy in long-term wholesale power purchase contracts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10)(A);  see generally Jeffrey D. Watkiss &amp; Douglas W. Smith,  The Energy Policy Act of 1992--A Watershed for Competition in the Wholesale Power Market, 10 Yale J. on Reg. 447, 475 &amp; n. 130 (1993).  PUC is included in the class of state agencies required to perform this study;  that is, those requiring or allowing utilities to purchase long-term wholesale power supplies.  See 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10)(A).  The statute provides that states must \"consider and make a determination concerning whether ... to implement the[se] standards\" by October 24, 1993.  Id. Sec. 2621(d)(10)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs maintain that the Energy Policy Act study concerns only a new class of non-utility power producers called \"exempt wholesale generators\" (EWGs).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Plaintiffs also contend that the only power producers intended by Congress to be subject to PUC's inquiries are EWGs, electric utilities, and certain affiliates of EWGs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central issue is whether Congress intended state agencies to make inquiries of QFs to complete their evaluation of wholesale power supplies.  Considering first the language of the statute to be construed, see American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 68, 102 S.Ct. 1534, 1537, 71 L.Ed.2d 748 (1982), we note that Congress mandated that agencies, including PUC, perform \"a general evaluation\" of the enumerated factors respecting wholesale power supplies.  Although the statute makes no mention of QFs, the use of the term \"general evaluation\" suggests that the scope of the study is intended to be broad.  Only the second factor--the impact of debt-laden EWG capital structures on utilities and on reliability--explicitly refers to EWGs;  the remaining three factors refer to \"long-term wholesale power purchases.\"   It is undisputed that plaintiffs supply power at wholesale to electric utilities in New Hampshire under long-term contracts, and that QFs entering the market in the future could enter into long-term contracts with utilities in the state.  The language and structure of the statute indicate that Congress intended QFs to be a source of information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Common sense reinforces this conclusion.  Congress clearly intended the \"general evaluation\" of wholesale power supply issues to be meaningful and comprehensive, especially because the Energy Policy Act is designed to increase competition in the wholesale power production market.  See generally H.R.Rep. No. 474(I),  supra, at 138-40, reprinted in 1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1961-63;  Watkiss &amp; Smith, supra, at 449.  Nurtured by FERC's regulations and by PURPA since 1978, QFs have become an important source of power for utilities to purchase at wholesale.  For example, there were at least eighty QFs operating in New Hampshire in the spring of 1993.  EWGs, in contrast to QFs, are a new category of wholesale power producer, created by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  A company can become an EWG only by filing an application with FERC.  See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 79z-5a(a)(1).  Accordingly, there were no EWGs in existence when Congress enacted the provision requiring states to study wholesale power supply issues.  We are led inexorably to the conclusion that Congress intended state agencies to gather data from QFs, because they are significant existing sources of wholesale power, in order to assess the present power situation and to predict the impact of new entrants into the wholesale power market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, counsel for plaintiffs stated that state agencies could acquire information regarding QFs from third-party sources.  This point does not affect our determination that Congress intended states to make inquiries of QFs, so that the general evaluation of long-term wholesale power purchases would be meaningful.  No source of information on QFs would be as authoritative as the QFs themselves.  If Congress intended information regarding QFs to be part of the Energy Policy Act \"general evaluation,\" presumably Congress intended that QFs would be the source of this information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' next argument is that section 714 of the Energy Policy Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 824(g)(1), manifests Congress's intent that states cannot subject QFs to business and financial inquiries.  Section 714 provides, \"[u]pon written order of a State commission, a State commission may examine the books, accounts, memoranda, contracts, and records of\" electric utilities, EWGs, and affiliates of EWGs.  16 U.S.C. Sec. 824(g)(1).  Because Congress enacted both section 714 and the provision mandating the study of wholesale power supplies under the Energy Policy Act, plaintiffs argue that section 714 limits the scope of the \"general evaluation\" required by 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10) to electric utilities, EWGs, and their affiliates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' argument elevates a rule of statutory construction--that two provisions of the same legislation must be read together--above a full and sensible reading of the statutes at issue.  Section 714 specifically provides:  \"Nothing in this section shall--(A) preempt applicable State law concerning the provision of records and other information;  or (B) in any way limit rights to obtain records and other information under Federal law, contracts, or otherwise.\"  16 U.S.C. Sec. 824(g)(4).  That provision negates plaintiffs' attempt to use the facilities enumerated in section 714 as an exclusive list of power producers susceptible to state data requests pursuant to section 2621(d)(10).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, there is an obvious reason why Congress would have omitted QFs from section 714, while still intending that QFs respond to inquiries pursuant to section 2621(d)(10):  section 714 is an unrestricted grant of authority.  The statute provides that a state agency may examine the records of electric utilities, EWGs, and affiliates of EWGs, \"if such examination is required for the effective discharge\" of the agency's \"responsibilities affecting the provision of electric service.\"  16 U.S.C. Sec. 824(g)(1).  The statute does not mention section 2621(d)(10), let alone limit the exercise of this document inspection authority to gathering information for an evaluation of long-term wholesale power supply purchases.  If QFs were among the power producers listed in section 714, a court could infer Congress's intent to repeal partially FERC's QF exemptions, so that QFs would be proper subjects of any information requests by state agencies.  See Natural Resources Defense Council v. Environmental Protection Agency, 824 F.2d 1258, 1278 (1st Cir.1987) (more recent, more specific enactments prevail over prior, more generalized law);  1A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland on Stats. Sec. 23.14, at 372 (5th ed. 1993).  Excluding QFs from section 714 preserves the general QF exemption from state laws and regulations respecting the finances and organization of electric utilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs argue that allowing PUC to make inquiries into the finances and organization of QFs is tantamount to finding an implied repeal of the QF exemption.  Our holding does not cut that broadly.  We hold that PUC may make inquiries of QFs on a one-time basis because it is acting to complete a study mandated by federal law.  Such regulatory action is not a state \"law or regulation respecting ... [t]he financial and organizational regulation of electric utilities,\" 18 C.F.R. Sec. 292.602(c)(1)(ii).  Our decision does not alter the QF exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the foregoing, we reject plaintiffs' preemption claim.  Even accepting all plaintiffs' factual allegations as true, we find no basis on which plaintiffs may proceed.  This case is thus properly dismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a cognizable claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the district court did not rely on this ground for dismissing this case.  We note, however, that PUC affirmatively pleaded that the complaint failed to state a claim.  Moreover, the district court stated that even if it had subject matter jurisdiction, there would still be \"problems with plaintiffs' argument,\" Bristol Energy, 827 F.Supp. at 83, and we ordered the parties to address the merits on appeal.  Even assuming the district court did not deem that reason dispositive, we may affirm the court's ruling on any theory supported by the record.  See Willhauck v. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689, 704 (1st Cir.1991).

Sec. 796(17)(C), (18)(B).  QFs are a class of facilities, defined by their size, fuel use, efficiency, and ownership, see FERC v. Mississippi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110718\"><a href=\"/opinion/110718/ferc-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 750 &amp; n. 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110718\"><a href=\"/opinion/110718/ferc-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Sec. 292.602(c)(1).  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) promulgates regulations affecting QFs.  State utility regulatory commissions such as PUC implement FERC's regulations on the purchases and sales of power between utilities and QFs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In passing the legislation authorizing special rules for QFs, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), Congress viewed QFs as desirable alternatives to traditional electric utility generating facilities.  See FERC, 456 U.S. at 750, 102 S.Ct. at 2132. At that time, Congress perceived two impediments to QF development:   the reluctance of public utilities to sell power to and buy power from QFs;  and  the financial burdens imposed on QFs by state and federal laws designed to regulate utilities providing electricity to the public.  See id. at 750-51, 102 S.Ct. at 2132-34.   To overcome the first impediment, Congress mandated that FERC promulgate regulations, for states to implement, governing transactions between utilities and QFs, including a requirement that utilities purchase electricity from QFs at a rate up to the utility's avoided cost (i.e., the utility's cost if it generated the power itself, or purchased it from another source).  See 16 U.S.C. Sec. 824a-3(b), -3(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To solve the second problem, Congress eased the financial burdens on QFs by authorizing FERC to exempt QFs from certain federal laws, and from state laws or regulations \"respecting the rates, or respecting the financial or organizational regulation, of electric utilities,\" if necessary to encourage QFs.  Id. Sec. 824a-3(e).  FERC's exemptions for QFs are codified at 18 C.F.R. Secs. 292.601 and .602.  Plaintiffs allege that PUC's business and financial disclosure order violates the regulation exempting QFs from state regulation of the finances and organization of electric utilities.  See id. Sec. 292.602(c)(1)(ii) (hereinafter \"QF exemption\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 16, 1993, PUC commenced proceedings to perform a study of wholesale power supplies required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 16 U.S.C.

They sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction to prevent PUC from enforcing its disclosure orders.

Secs. 2611-2634]....\"  The authority PUC cited for issuing its data requests is 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10).

Sec. 2621(d)(10), not under the rules cited in section 824a-3(g).  We conclude that federal question jurisdiction exists in this case, as in Shaw, because plaintiffs allege a preemption claim and seek to enjoin state officials from interfering with a federal right, i.e., the QF exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs have alleged that they are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief because PUC's action is preempted by federal law.  The federal law that allegedly preempts PUC's inquiries is the QF exemption.  That regulation provides in pertinent part:  \"Any qualifying facility shall be exempted ... from State law or regulation respecting ... [t]he financial and organizational regulation of electric utilities.\"  18 C.F.R. Sec. 292.602(c)(1)(ii).  We consider, seriatim, two issues:   whether PUC's one-time inquiry of QFs to gather information for a study mandated by 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10) constitutes state \"regulation respecting ... [t]he financial and organizational regulation of electric utilities\";  and  whether Congress intended state agencies such as PUC to request information from QFs to complete the study mandated by 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>1. Are QFs Exempt from PUC's Inquiries?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FERC, as an amicus in this case, argues that the QF exemption does not preempt PUC's inquiries because PUC is seeking information on a one-time basis, to complete a federally mandated study of wholesale power supplies.  See section 712 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10).  According to FERC, such a limited collection of information for a federally mandated study does not contravene the letter or the spirit of the QF exemption from state \"regulation respecting ... the financ[es] and organization[ ]\" of QFs.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FERC promulgated the QF exemption pursuant to Congress's mandate that QFs be exempted from state regulations on the rates, finances, and organization of electric utilities, if FERC found such an exemption necessary to encourage QF power production.  See 16 U.S.C. Sec. 824a-3(e)(1).  FERC takes the position that its exemption allows QFs to avoid \"utility-type\" regulation, 45 Fed.Reg. 12,214, 12,232 (Feb. 25, 1980) (preamble to final rule), including state control of electricity rates and the finances, capitalization, and organization of electric utilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PUC's inquiries are not preempted by FERC's QF exemption.  We do not dispute that PUC is seeking financial and organizational information from plaintiffs.  And we can visualize circumstances in which a state agency's standing order requiring periodic disclosures of financial records might be part-and-parcel of the control over electric utilities from which QFs are exempt.  See generally 18 C.F.R. Sec. 292.601(c) (exempting QFs from, inter alia, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 825(b) (authorizing FERC to have access \"at all times\" to accounts, records, and memoranda of public utilities));  44 Fed.Reg. 38,863, 38,865 (July 3, 1979) (FERC Staff Paper) (noting that FERC could exempt QFs from \"requirements for filing voluminous reports concerning operating, cost and revenue data\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But PUC did not assert such plenary authority over QFs when it issued the document requests.  In fact, PUC cited only its authority under state law and the necessity of completing the evaluation mandated by section 712 of the Energy Policy Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10).  The record suggests that PUC's inquiries seek information related to the factors enumerated in 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10)--assuming QFs are proper sources of such information.  Because PUC is gathering data on a one-time basis to perform the study mandated by the Energy Policy Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10), the QF exemption is not a sound foundation for a preemption claim.  Such an inquiry is not utility-type regulation.  Nor does the record suggest that the information will be used for utility-type regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>2. Did Congress Intend QFs To Be Included in the Study?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that Congress did not intend QFs to be included in the Energy Policy Act study.  The Energy Policy Act requires that certain state agencies perform \"a general evaluation\" of four factors relating to wholesale power supplies:   the impact of long-term wholesale power purchases on a utility's cost of capital and retail rates;   the effect of the debt-laden capital structure of \"exempt wholesale generators\" on utilities and on reliability;   the propriety of advance approval for long-term wholesale power purchase contracts;  and  the need for assurances of fuel supply adequacy in long-term wholesale power purchase contracts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10)(A);  see generally Jeffrey D. Watkiss &amp; Douglas W. Smith,  The Energy Policy Act of 1992--A Watershed for Competition in the Wholesale Power Market, 10 Yale J. on Reg. 447, 475 &amp; n. 130 (1993).  PUC is included in the class of state agencies required to perform this study;  that is, those requiring or allowing utilities to purchase long-term wholesale power supplies.  See 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10)(A).  The statute provides that states must \"consider and make a determination concerning whether ... to implement the[se] standards\" by October 24, 1993.  Id. Sec. 2621(d)(10)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs maintain that the Energy Policy Act study concerns only a new class of non-utility power producers called \"exempt wholesale generators\" (EWGs).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Plaintiffs also contend that the only power producers intended by Congress to be subject to PUC's inquiries are EWGs, electric utilities, and certain affiliates of EWGs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central issue is whether Congress intended state agencies to make inquiries of QFs to complete their evaluation of wholesale power supplies.  Considering first the language of the statute to be construed, see American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110690\"><a href=\"/opinion/110690/american-tobacco-co-v-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110690\"><a href=\"/opinion/110690/american-tobacco-co-v-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span> (1982), we note that Congress mandated that agencies, including PUC, perform \"a general evaluation\" of the enumerated factors respecting wholesale power supplies.  Although the statute makes no mention of QFs, the use of the term \"general evaluation\" suggests that the scope of the study is intended to be broad.  Only the second factor--the impact of debt-laden EWG capital structures on utilities and on reliability--explicitly refers to EWGs;  the remaining three factors refer to \"long-term wholesale power purchases.\"   It is undisputed that plaintiffs supply power at wholesale to electric utilities in New Hampshire under long-term contracts, and that QFs entering the market in the future could enter into long-term contracts with utilities in the state.  The language and structure of the statute indicate that Congress intended QFs to be a source of information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Common sense reinforces this conclusion.  Congress clearly intended the \"general evaluation\" of wholesale power supply issues to be meaningful and comprehensive, especially because the Energy Policy Act is designed to increase competition in the wholesale power production market.  See generally H.R.Rep. No. 474(I),  supra, at 138-40, reprinted in 1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1961-63;  Watkiss &amp; Smith, supra, at 449.  Nurtured by FERC's regulations and by PURPA since 1978, QFs have become an important source of power for utilities to purchase at wholesale.  For example, there were at least eighty QFs operating in New Hampshire in the spring of 1993.  EWGs, in contrast to QFs, are a new category of wholesale power producer, created by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  A company can become an EWG only by filing an application with FERC.  See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 79z-5a(a)(1).  Accordingly, there were no EWGs in existence when Congress enacted the provision requiring states to study wholesale power supply issues.  We are led inexorably to the conclusion that Congress intended state agencies to gather data from QFs, because they are significant existing sources of wholesale power, in order to assess the present power situation and to predict the impact of new entrants into the wholesale power market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, counsel for plaintiffs stated that state agencies could acquire information regarding QFs from third-party sources.  This point does not affect our determination that Congress intended states to make inquiries of QFs, so that the general evaluation of long-term wholesale power purchases would be meaningful.  No source of information on QFs would be as authoritative as the QFs themselves.  If Congress intended information regarding QFs to be part of the Energy Policy Act \"general evaluation,\" presumably Congress intended that QFs would be the source of this information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' next argument is that section 714 of the Energy Policy Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 824(g)(1), manifests Congress's intent that states cannot subject QFs to business and financial inquiries.  Section 714 provides, \"[u]pon written order of a State commission, a State commission may examine the books, accounts, memoranda, contracts, and records of\" electric utilities, EWGs, and affiliates of EWGs.  16 U.S.C. Sec. 824(g)(1).  Because Congress enacted both section 714 and the provision mandating the study of wholesale power supplies under the Energy Policy Act, plaintiffs argue that section 714 limits the scope of the \"general evaluation\" required by 16 U.S.C. Sec. 2621(d)(10) to electric utilities, EWGs, and their affiliates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' argument elevates a rule of statutory construction--that two provisions of the same legislation must be read together--above a full and sensible reading of the statutes at issue.  Section 714 specifically provides:  \"Nothing in this section shall--(A) preempt applicable State law concerning the provision of records and other information;  or (B) in any way limit rights to obtain records and other information under Federal law, contracts, or otherwise.\"  16 U.S.C. Sec. 824(g)(4).  That provision negates plaintiffs' attempt to use the facilities enumerated in section 714 as an exclusive list of power producers susceptible to state data requests pursuant to section 2621(d)(10).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, there is an obvious reason why Congress would have omitted QFs from section 714, while still intending that QFs respond to inquiries pursuant to section 2621(d)(10):  section 714 is an unrestricted grant of authority.  The statute provides that a state agency may examine the records of electric utilities, EWGs, and affiliates of EWGs, \"if such examination is required for the effective discharge\" of the agency's \"responsibilities affecting the provision of electric service.\"  16 U.S.C. Sec. 824(g)(1).  The statute does not mention section 2621(d)(10), let alone limit the exercise of this document inspection authority to gathering information for an evaluation of long-term wholesale power supply purchases.  If QFs were among the power producers listed in section 714, a court could infer Congress's intent to repeal partially FERC's QF exemptions, so that QFs would be proper subjects of any information requests by state agencies.  See Natural Resources Defense Council v. Environmental Protection Agency, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492030\"><a href=\"/opinion/492030/natural-resources-defense-council-inc-conservation-law-foundation-of-new/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></a></span>, 1278 (1st Cir.1987) (more recent, more specific enactments prevail over prior, more generalized law);  1A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland on Stats. Sec. 23.14, at 372 (5th ed. 1993).  Excluding QFs from section 714 preserves the general QF exemption from state laws and regulations respecting the finances and organization of electric utilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs argue that allowing PUC to make inquiries into the finances and organization of QFs is tantamount to finding an implied repeal of the QF exemption.  Our holding does not cut that broadly.  We hold that PUC may make inquiries of QFs on a one-time basis because it is acting to complete a study mandated by federal law.  Such regulatory action is not a state \"law or regulation respecting ... [t]he financial and organizational regulation of electric utilities,\" 18 C.F.R. Sec. 292.602(c)(1)(ii).  Our decision does not alter the QF exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the foregoing, we reject plaintiffs' preemption claim.  Even accepting all plaintiffs' factual allegations as true, we find no basis on which plaintiffs may proceed.  This case is thus properly dismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a cognizable claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the district court did not rely on this ground for dismissing this case.  We note, however, that PUC affirmatively pleaded that the complaint failed to state a claim.  Moreover, the district court stated that even if it had subject matter jurisdiction, there would still be \"problems with plaintiffs' argument,\" Bristol Energy, 827 F.Supp. at 83, and we ordered the parties to address the merits on appeal.  Even assuming the district court did not deem that reason dispositive, we may affirm the court's ruling on any theory supported by the record.  See Willhauck v. Halpin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575825\"><a href=\"/opinion/575825/francis-a-willhauck-jr-v-paul-halpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span>, 704 (1st Cir.1991).
