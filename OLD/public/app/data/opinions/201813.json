Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n          Torruella, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     W. E. Whittington IV for appellant/cross-appellee.\n     Kelly E. Dowd, with whom Upton & Hatfield, LLP, was on brief,\nfor appellees/cross-appellants.\n\n\n\n                          October 21, 2005\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.      This is an appeal of a monetary\n\nsanction that was imposed by the magistrate judge on defendants'\n\nlawyer, William E. Whittington IV, for discovery misconduct.            The\n\ncourt required that Whittington personally compensate the opposing\n\nparties for the attorney's fees and costs incurred in opposing a\n\nprotective order that he had obtained.        Citing the injury to his\n\nprofessional reputation, Whittington also appeals certain findings\n\nof fact made by the magistrate judge in support of the monetary\n\nsanction. The district court affirmed the sanction and most of the\n\nfindings.    After a careful review of the record, we affirm the\n\nsanction but vacate a finding that the district court affirmed.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            To explain the genesis of the sanction and findings, we\n\nmust review the history of the underlying case.        River Valley was\n\na health club located in Hanover, New Hampshire.         In early 1999,\n\nMary C. Sheppard, the principal plaintiff in this case, brought a\n\nclaim of sexual harassment against defendants (in essence, the club\n\nand its owners, Joseph and Elizabeth Asch) for offensive incidents\n\nshe said she experienced while working at the club.           The club's\n\nmanager, Robert Aubin, filed a lawsuit of his own, alleging that he\n\nwas fired in retaliation for reporting Sheppard's complaints about\n\nharassment.1     In   both   cases,    defendants   denied   all   of   the\n\n\n\n     1\n       That suit, Aubin v. River Valley Fitness One, LP, was\nassigned to a different district-court judge.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fallegations and filed counterclaims against Sheppard and Aubin,\n\naccusing them of conspiring to fabricate their lawsuits.             In early\n\n2000, the two cases were consolidated for discovery.\n\n           In August 2000, defendants and Aubin discussed settling\n\ntheir dispute (and, shortly thereafter, did settle).           The sanction\n\nin this case and the findings all derive from three instances in\n\nwhich Whittington made claims about the settlement process in the\n\nAubin case.\n\nA.   Whittington's statements to the Aubin court on August 21, 2000\n\n           On August 15, 2000, Whittington sent a letter to Aubin's\n\ncounsel   to,   as   the   letter   put   it,   \"summarize   our   settlement\n\ndiscussions.\"    The letter opened by stating that \"[t]he parties\n\nwill settle on the following terms (subject to details being worked\n\nout on the open items below).\"            The letter provided that \"Aubin\n\nwould agree to a stipulated judgment of $50,000\" in River Valley's\n\nfavor, but that Aubin need pay only $100 of that amount for release\n\nand satisfaction. Also, because River Valley was keenly interested\n\nin getting information from Aubin to help with its dispute with\n\nSheppard, Aubin would provide details of his discussions with\n\nSheppard about their claims.          In addition, River Valley wanted\n\ncorroborating information and documents from two other people,\n\nBarney Brannen and Jack Panzica, who River Valley believed were\n\ninvolved with the alleged conspiracy against it; to that end, River\n\nValley had asked the court for subpoenas.           The letter stated that\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe parties would not file the stipulated settlement with the court\n\nuntil after deposing those two witnesses.                In the meantime, the\n\nparties \"will jointly inform the Court we're close to settlement .\n\n. . and tell the Court that it would help the parties' settlement\n\nnegotiations to get a prompt ruling on the Brannen/Panzica motions,\n\nwhich Aubin will now join.\"            Whittington stressed the importance\n\nthat River Valley placed on Aubin's information by underlining the\n\nfollowing sentence: \"The settlement is contingent upon defendants'\n\nsatisfaction that Aubin is assisting defendants in good faith to\n\nthe best of his ability.\"            The letter closed by stating: \"If the\n\nabove     is   satisfactory,       please   indicate    by   signing   below   and\n\nreturning a copy of this letter.\"           The next day, August 16, Aubin's\n\ncounsel signed her agreement and returned the letter.\n\n               On August 21, 2000, Whittington, as promised, told the\n\nAubin court that the parties were close to settlement:\n\n      The parties advise the Court that they have seriously\n      discussed settlement, that they believe the prospects for\n      settlement are excellent after resolution of the two\n      pending motions [to get information from Brannen and\n      Panzica], and that resolution of the motions will be\n      helpful to the settlement process.\n\nOn October 3, 2000, having resolved the Brannen and Panzica issues2\n\nand     having    obtained     a    satisfactory       affidavit    from   Aubin,\n\n\n\n      2\n       On August 21, 2000, Panzica's attorney told                 the court that\nhis client had no documents responsive to the                      subpoena.   On\nSeptember 13, 2000, the court ordered Brannen to                    turn over his\nresponsive documents, Brannen soon did so, and he                  was deposed on\nSeptember 29.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fWhittington authorized Aubin's counsel to file the stipulated\n\njudgment with the court and release other settlement documents from\n\nescrow. On October 4, 2000, the district court entered judgment in\n\nthe Aubin case.\n\nB. Whittington's letter to Sheppard's counsel on October 6, 2000\n\n           Whittington then tried to put the settlement in Aubin to\n\nhis   clients'    advantage   in    Sheppard.    On   October   6,   2000,\n\nWhittington wrote a letter to Sheppard's counsel, informing her of\n\nthe outcome in the Aubin case.         Whittington's letter did not say\n\nthat River Valley had agreed to accept $100 as satisfaction of a\n\nmuch larger judgment; the letter referred simply to the \"$50,000\n\njudgment.\"       Whittington wrote that it was \"clear\" that, when\n\npresented with the \"extensive evidence\" marshaled by River Valley,\n\n\"Aubin and his counsel saw that the litigation had only one\n\npossible outcome.\"     The letter explained that River Valley was now\n\nalso privy to Aubin's \"inside perspective.\"           Referring to \"the\n\npress's continuing strong interest in the litigation,\" the letter\n\nwarned that Sheppard might be portrayed in an unflattering light\n\n\"once all the facts came out.\"        Consequently, the letter advised,\n\n\"[r]eaching a negotiated settlement promptly\" would help to avoid\n\nthat unpleasant outcome.           The letter expressed River Valley's\n\nwillingness to settle for payment of $50,000 and an affidavit from\n\nSheppard backing up River Valley’s version of the disputed events.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fC.   Whittington's motion for a protective order on March 29, 2001\n\n           Faced with Whittington's letter and wanting to see the\n\nsettlement agreement for herself, Sheppard's counsel filed a motion\n\nto compel its production. On March 29, 2001, Whittington responded\n\nby moving for a protective order, seeking to keep the terms of the\n\nagreement secret.     Claiming that the settlement agreement in Aubin\n\nhad \"no bearing on any of the issues in this case,\" Whittington\n\noffered   to   let   the   court    review    the   documents   in    camera   to\n\ndetermine for itself whether they were relevant to the Sheppard\n\ncase.     If   the   court   did     order    the   agreement's      production,\n\nWhittington asked that access be limited to Sheppard's counsel.\n\n           On March 30, 2001, the magistrate judge in the Sheppard\n\ncase granted the protective order to the extent that it sought\n\ncounsel's-eyes-only review of the settlement agreement.                On April\n\n23, 2001, having now received and read the agreement, Sheppard's\n\ncounsel filed a motion for relief from the protective order,\n\nseeking full freedom to disclose the agreement, and for \"sanctions\n\npursuant to Rule 26(c),\" which governs protective orders.\n\n           That motion led to the sanctions at issue in this case.\n\nOn May 23, 2001, the magistrate judge ordered the settlement\n\nagreement to be unsealed.          Referring to what it called a \"lack of\n\nforthrightness\" on Whittington's part and \"[h]alf-truths about the\n\nAubin settlement,\" the magistrate judge also scheduled a hearing on\n\n\"appropriate sanctions, if any.\"             At the end of that hearing on\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fJune 13, 2001, the magistrate judge said: \"There will be at least\n\none sanction.    Mr. Whittington is going to demonstrate to me that\n\nhe has taken at least 10 hours specifically of CLE related to\n\nprofessional conduct responsibility rules within the next three\n\nmonths.\" Then, addressing the lawyer whom Whittington had retained\n\nfor the hearing, the magistrate judge added: \"And Mr. Daschbach,\n\nyou are to tutor him with regard to how you practice law in the\n\nState of New Hampshire and in this court.\"\n\n             On September 27, 2001, the magistrate judge issued his\n\norder   on   sanctions,   making   three   main   findings.   First,   the\n\nmagistrate judge found that \"Whittington misled the court when he\n\nargued that the Aubin settlement is irrelevant to the issues in\n\nthis case.\"    Aubin's agreement to cooperate with River Valley was\n\n\"directly relevant to Aubin's credibility.\" Second, the magistrate\n\njudge found that \"Whittington intentionally misled the plaintiffs\"\n\nin his October 6, 2000 letter \"to intimidate them into a $50,000\n\nsettlement in this case.\"     Third, the magistrate judge found that\n\nWhittington sought the protective order so as to \"conceal his\n\ndeceptive conduct in the Aubin case\" (i.e., telling the Aubin court\n\nthat the parties were merely \"close\" to a settlement when, in the\n\nmagistrate's view, they had already \"reached a settlement in\n\nprinciple\").     The magistrate judge concluded that Whittington's\n\nmotion for a protective order had not been substantially justified\n\nand ordered a monetary sanction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4):\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fspecifically,   Whittington     \"shall   personally     compensate   the\n\nplaintiffs for their expenses, including reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees, incurred in connection with their opposition to and the\n\nmotion for relief from the protective order.\"\n\n          On January 22, 2004, the district court affirmed the\n\nsanction imposed by the magistrate judge.       The court also found\n\nthat the record \"fully support[ed] the Magistrate Judge's . . .\n\nfindings and conclusions,\" with one exception.        The district court\n\nrejected the magistrate judge's finding that Whittington sought a\n\nprotective order partly \"to conceal his deceptive conduct in the\n\nAubin case.\"    Referring to Whittington's suggestion that the\n\nmagistrate judge inspect the settlement agreement in camera, the\n\ndistrict court noted that this was \"hardly the kind of offer likely\n\nto be made by one bent upon concealing his misconduct.\"              The\n\ndistrict court then referred the matter to the magistrate judge for\n\ncalculation of attorney's fees.\n\n          On April 27, 2004, the magistrate judge issued an order\n\nassessing $6,538 in fees.     On May 25, 2004, the district court\n\nentered judgment in the case.    On June 16, 2004, Whittington filed\n\nthis timely appeal, asking that we vacate the sanctions and set\n\naside the magistrate judge's findings about his misconduct before\n\nthe Aubin court and in his letter to Sheppard’s counsel.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          We have jurisdiction to review the sanction in this case\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fas an appeal from a final decision of the district court.                             See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291.            We can review the underlying factual findings as\n\nwell.    \"The imposition of a sanction on an attorney is universally\n\nregarded       as    an       order,   and,      if     an     appellate      tribunal      has\n\njurisdiction         to    review      such   an      order,     its    examination      will\n\nencompass the underlying findings.\"                     Williams v. United States (In\n\nre Williams), 156 F.3d 86, 90 (1st Cir. 1998) (footnote omitted).\n\nIn certain circumstances, even factual findings by themselves\n\n(i.e., unattached to any sanctions) can be appealed because of the\n\n\"serious       practical        consequences\"         they     may     have   on    counsel's\n\nreputation.         Obert v. Republic W. Ins. Co., 398 F.3d 138,                     143 (1st\n\nCir. 2005), remand order modified, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 4793 (1st\n\nCir. Mar. 24, 2005).\n\n               \"Like the district court, we review [the magistrate\n\njudge's] factual findings under the 'clearly erroneous' rubric.\"\n\nPhinney v. Wentworth Douglas Hosp., 199 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nAs for the magistrate judge's decision itself, \"[w]e have long\n\nrecognized that the decision as to whether discovery sanctions are\n\nwarranted and the choice of what sanctions should be imposed are\n\nmatters within the sound discretion of the trial court.                             As such,\n\nreview    of    .    .    .    discovery      sanctions        is    only     for   abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.\"         United States v. Soto-Beniquez, 356 F.3d 1, 30 (1st\n\nCir.    2003),      cert.       denied,    124     S.    Ct.    2432    (2004)      (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted).                        \"An abuse of discretion\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\foccurs when a material factor deserving significant weight is\n\nignored, when an improper factor is relied upon, or when all proper\n\nand no improper factors are assessed, but the court makes a serious\n\nmistake in weighing them.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn the Rule 11 context, the Supreme Court has explained that a\n\ncourt \"would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its\n\nruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous\n\nassessment of the evidence.\"     Cooter & Gell v. Hartmax Corp., 496\n\nU.S. 384, 405 (1990); see also Obert, 398 F.3d at 143.            We apply\n\nthat logic to our review of the sanction and findings at issue\n\nhere.\n\nA. Factual findings\n\n           1. Whittington's statements to the Aubin court\n\n           We first examine the magistrate judge's finding that\n\nWhittington misrepresented the settlement status of the Aubin case\n\nwhen he told the Aubin court that the parties were close to\n\nsettlement (\"the prospects for settlement are excellent\") but had\n\nnot yet settled.\n\n           Before we reach the merits of this issue, however, we\n\nreject at the outset Whittington's argument that the magistrate\n\njudge   somehow    lacked   jurisdiction   to   make   findings     (which\n\nWhittington here calls \"sanctions\") about his conduct in the Aubin\n\ncase.   These cases--Sheppard and Aubin--are closely related.         They\n\nhave a common defendant, River Valley.      Aubin alleged that he was\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\ffired in retaliation for reporting Sheppard's complaints about\n\nharassment.    The cases were consolidated for discovery before the\n\nsame magistrate judge.\n\n            True, it would be odd for Sheppard to win her attorney's\n\nfees and costs for Whittington's conduct in a case to which she was\n\nnot a party.    However, that is not what happened here.         Sheppard\n\nsought    compensation   for   costs     incurred   in   challenging   the\n\nprotective order in her case.      In considering that request, the\n\nmagistrate judge had to look at Whittington's conduct in Aubin to\n\nevaluate what Whittington was trying to achieve with a protective\n\norder in Sheppard.    Moreover, Whittington himself made the events\n\nsurrounding the Aubin settlement an issue in this case when he\n\ndecided to try to use that settlement to encourage settlement here,\n\ntoo.     The magistrate judge's findings of fact, including the\n\nfinding about Whittington's conduct in the Aubin case, were all\n\nrelated to his decision to impose sanctions for Whittington's\n\ndiscovery misconduct in this case.\n\n            We now examine the merits of the finding at issue.          In\n\nhis September 27, 2001 order, the magistrate judge said that\n\nWhittington, when he told the Aubin court that the parties were\n\nclose to settlement instead of settled, had engaged in \"deceptive\n\nconduct\" and \"misrepresentations\" before the Aubin court.              The\n\ndistrict court, for its part, said that Whittington’s conduct\n\n       certainly qualifies as \"sharp practice,\" well outside the\n       boundaries of complete and full candor owed to the court\n\n                                  -11-\n\f     by those who practice in this district.3      At worst,\n     counsel intentionally sought to mislead the court with\n     regard to the actual settlement status of the Aubin case\n     in order to obtain rulings on pending motions that\n     otherwise probably would not have been made.\n\nIn this instance, we cannot agree with such a harsh view of\n\nWhittington's conduct.\n\n          First and foremost, we take seriously River Valley's\n\nconcerns, expressed in the letter to Aubin's counsel, about being\n\nable to corroborate Aubin's testimony with information obtained\n\nfrom Brannen and Panzica.      The magistrate judge dismissed that\n\nconcern, writing that \"[n]othing in the settlement documents even\n\nsuggests that this is true.\"    But Whittington's letter to Aubin’s\n\n\n\n     3\n       The Rules of Professional Conduct of the New Hampshire\nSupreme Court are the relevant ethical standards for lawyers\npracticing before the United States District Court for the District\nof New Hampshire. See D.N.H.R. 83.5 DR-1. All lawyers have a duty\nof candor to the tribunal, which is violated by \"knowingly\" making\na \"false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal.\" N.H.\nRules of Prof'l Conduct R. 3.3(a)(1).\n     Although neither the magistrate judge nor the district court\nreferred to specific rules of New Hampshire's Rules of Professional\nConduct in their analysis of Whittington's conduct, it is apparent\nto us that the rules informed their analysis of that conduct. In\ntheir briefs on appeal, the parties also rely on those rules and\ncommentary to the ABA's Code of Professional Responsibility, see\ninfra, fn. 5, in defending and criticizing Whittington's conduct.\nWe also refer to the rules and that commentary in evaluating\nWhittington's conduct.    However, in making his findings about\nWhittington's conduct, the magistrate judge did not explicitly make\na finding that a specific rule of New Hampshire's Rules of\nProfessional Conduct had been violated and neither did the district\ncourt. We take a similar approach here, focusing our analysis only\non the factual findings of the magistrate judge. As noted above,\nfactual findings themselves about unprofessional conduct can be the\nsubject of appeal because of the \"serious practical consequences\"\nthey have on counsel's reputation. Obert, 398 F.3d at 143.\n\n                                -12-\n\fcounsel    could       hardly    have       been    clearer     when    it    stated       that\n\n\"settlement is contingent upon defendants' satisfaction that Aubin\n\nis assisting defendants in good faith to the best of his ability.\"\n\nThat statement came at the end of a paragraph stressing River\n\nValley's interest in Aubin's \"actions/discussions\" with Brannen and\n\nPanzica.        Two    paragraphs       later,       the   letter      referred       to    the\n\nimportance of \"getting a ruling on the Brannen and Panzica motions,\n\nand     defendants      receiving        their       documents       and     taking      their\n\ndepositions.\"           Read    fairly      in     context,     these      statements      are\n\nevidence of River Valley's reluctance to settle until it had\n\nexhausted       its    ability    to    corroborate        Aubin's      affidavit.          As\n\nWhittington argues, \"no prudent litigant in these circumstances\n\nwould have given up leverage by settling just before obtaining the\n\ncooperation       it    was    bargaining          for.\"      Thus    it    was   fair     for\n\nWhittington       to    characterize         the     parties     as     being     close     to\n\nsettlement after the August 15, 2001 letter, but not yet settled.\n\n            The magistrate judge placed considerable emphasis on the\n\nnotion that the parties would have reached a settlement regardless\n\nof what happened with the pending discovery motions.                                  At the\n\nsanctions hearing, Whittington said that he believed that the case\n\nwould    have    settled       even    if    River     Valley    had       been   unable    to\n\ncorroborate       Aubin’s       affidavit.           But   Whittington's          post     hoc\n\nspeculation, even if accurate, does not tell us much about how\n\nclose the parties were to a final settlement.                        To the contrary, in\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\falmost any negotiation, a lawyer would presumably begin with\n\nvarious ambitions that he hopes to realize in the end--a best-case\n\nscenario, as it were.   Yet at the same time, he may be able to\n\nconcede privately that his client is still better off settling even\n\nif it proves too difficult to secure some particular favorable\n\nconcession or other benefit.   Presumably, Whittington simply meant\n\nthat River Valley's ability to corroborate the affidavit of an\n\nuntrusted adversary was one such aim: valuable if he could get it,\n\nbut not a deal-breaker if he could not.    Importantly, Whittington\n\nnever said that River Valley would have settled if the information\n\nfrom Brannen and Panzica had fatally undermined Aubin's affidavit\n\nor critically impeached his credibility.\n\n          We are given further pause by the magistrate judge's own\n\nsomewhat varying descriptions of the settlement status in Aubin.\n\nAt one point, for example, the magistrate judge describes the\n\nAugust 15, 2001 letter as, if not a true settlement, then at least\n\na \"settlement in principle.\"   A \"settlement in principle\" may well\n\nhave justified Whittington's statement to the court that \"the\n\nprospects for settlement are excellent after resolution of the two\n\npending motions.\"   In the same vein, the magistrate judge wrote:\n\n\"Even if the Aubin matter was not settled on August 16, it was\n\nsettled prior to the court's September 12, 2000 ruling on the\n\nBrannen motion.\"    But in that case, then, it was not wrong for\n\nWhittington to describe the parties as close to settlement on\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fAugust 16.    Anyway, it seems to us that a finding of ethical\n\nmisconduct,   so   fraught    with   consequences   for   a   lawyer's\n\nprofessional reputation, should not rest on such fine distinctions.\n\nIf the court has trouble coming to an unqualified conclusion about\n\nthe parties' settlement status, then Whittington can hardly be\n\ncharged with telling a knowing falsehood--the standard set forth by\n\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct--under such circumstances.\n\n           Similarly, we are reluctant to affirm a finding of\n\nunethical conduct on the basis of a foray into contract law.       The\n\ndistrict court described the letter agreement as being a\n\n     settlement subject to a few conditions subsequent. . . .\n     Had those conditions not been met, perhaps defendants\n     could rescind the agreement and declare the settlement\n     null and void.\n\nIn the district court's view, \"there was nothing of substance left\n\nto negotiate,\" although in truth the settlement may not have been\n\n\"fully accomplished.\"    This conclusion, though--that the letter\n\nagreement may have had some legal force--seems to us to miss the\n\npoint.   Even though the letter agreement may have been enforceable\n\nin some circumstances, many contingencies remained.           The most\n\ncrucial legal documents--the mutual releases, Aubin's affidavit,\n\nthe stipulated judgment--had not even been drafted, let alone\n\nsigned or delivered.    In short, given the evident uncertainties\n\nthat remained, we conclude that Whittington gave a reasonably apt\n\nsummary of the situation when he advised the court that settlement\n\nwith Aubin was close.        The magistrate judge's finding to the\n\n                                 -15-\n\fcontrary was erroneous.\n\n          2. Letter to Sheppard's counsel\n\n          In this second finding, the magistrate judge found that\n\n\"[i]n his October 6 letter, Whittington intentionally misled the\n\nplaintiffs into believing that Aubin did commit to a $50,000\n\npayment in order to intimidate them into a $50,000 settlement in\n\nthis case.\"4   In that letter, Whittington wrote:\n\n     Attached please find a Stipulation to Judgment signed by\n     Judge Barbadoro on October 4 in the amount of $50,000 in\n     RVC’s [River Valley’s] favor in the Aubin case. It is\n     clear that, when presented with the extensive evidence\n     that we have compiled in support of our counterclaims\n     against him and our motion for summary judgment on his\n     own claims, Aubin and his counsel saw that the litigation\n     had only one possible outcome.\n\n     The $50,000 judgment, and the likelihood that it will\n     soon become public, prompt us to re-visit with you the\n     subject of settlement.\n\nHe then stated River Valley’s willingness to settle for \"[p]ayment\n\nof $50,000 by the Sheppards to [River Valley],\" among other demands\n\nsimilar to the Aubin settlement (for example, a truthful affidavit\n\nconfirming River Valley's version of events).   He never disclosed\n\nthat the true cost of the settlement for Aubin was $100.\n\n          New Hampshire's Rules of Professional Conduct impose a\n\nduty of truthfulness on lawyers with respect to people other than\n\n\n\n     4\n       The magistrate judge also noted that Whittington made this\nrepresentation not only to opposing counsel, but to the court as\nwell. In River Valley's motion for summary judgment, a footnote\nreferred to the $50,000 judgment without saying that it could be\nsatisfied for $100.\n\n                               -16-\n\fthe tribunal.           Again, the Rules prohibit knowing falsehoods.           See\n\nN.H.       Rules   of    Prof'l   Conduct   R.   4.1(a)   (\"In   the   course    of\n\nrepresenting a client a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false\n\nstatement of material fact or law to a third person. . . .\").                   The\n\ncommentary accompanying New Hampshire Rule 4.1 in effect at the\n\ntime states that \"[m]aking a false statement includes the failure\n\nto make a statement in circumstances in which nondisclosure is\n\nequivalent to making such a statement.\"                   N.H. Rules of Prof'l\n\nConduct R. 4.1, ABA Model Code Comments (2000).                  The magistrate\n\njudge's       finding      that   Whittington's     omission     constituted      a\n\nmisrepresentation is consistent with the commentary's elaboration\n\nof Rule 4.1.5\n\n\n       5\n       Before the ABA promulgated the Model Rules of Professional\nConduct in 1983, which many states have now adopted wholesale or\npiecemeal, the ABA had promulgated the Code of Professional\nResponsibility, also known as the Model Code. Following a period\nduring which New Hampshire lawyers were subject to the Model Code,\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court adopted the present Rules of\nProfessional Conduct, also known as the Model Rules, effective\nFebruary 1, 1986. There is ABA commentary to both the Model Code\nand the Model Rules. Oddly, publications setting forth the New\nHampshire Rules of Professional Conduct include commentary that\naccompanied the now supplanted Code of Professional Responsibility,\ni.e. the \"ABA Model Code Comments\". Although the New Hampshire\nSupreme Court has never formally adopted these comments, it has\nstated that \"Although the text of each rule is authoritative, the\ncomments are intended as guides to interpretation.\" Carpenito's\nCase, 139 N.H. 168, 173 (N.H. 1994).\n     Therefore, the Model Code commentary can inform judgments\nabout the professional conduct of an attorney in New Hampshire. In\nfact, this is how it appears the New Hampshire Supreme Court uses\nthe \"ABA Model Code Comments,\" in the wake of the switch from the\nCode to the Rules.     See e.g., Carpenito's Case, supra; In re\nCoffey's Case, 880 A.2d 403, 413 (N.H. 2005); In re Richmond's\nCase, 152 N.H. 155, 158-59 (N.H. 2005). As we noted in footnote 3,\n\n                                        -17-\n\f          It is evident from the letter, read in its entirety, that\n\nWhittington wanted Sheppard to believe that the Aubin case had\n\nsettled for a payment of $50,000.          True, Whittington did not say so\n\nexplicitly.    However, he managed to convey that impression anyway\n\nby selecting certain words and omitting certain details with\n\nstudied precision.       As the district court wrote: \"[T]he words used\n\n(and not used) by Whittington seem carefully chosen, and, if\n\ndissected and construed from a minimalist point of view, are\n\ndefensible    as    'literally    true.'        But   it   is   likewise    plainly\n\napparent that those words were meant to convey more.\"                  After all,\n\nthe letter's purpose--to encourage Sheppard to pay $50,000 to\n\nsettle her case--depended considerably on leaving the impression\n\nthat Aubin, in a similar position, had already committed to doing\n\nthe same thing.\n\n          We       are   not   saying    that    Whittington     had   a    general\n\nobligation to disclose the full terms of the Aubin settlement to\n\nSheppard just by mentioning the fact of the settlement.                    However,\n\nWhittington did more than that.                He chose to disclose the face\n\ndollar value of the judgment against Sheppard without disclosing\n\nthe real dollar value of the settlement, in an attempt to induce\n\nSheppard to settle on terms comparable to the Aubin judgment.\n\n\nthat appears to be what the magistrate judge and the district court\ndid here. The parties took a similar approach on appeal, and we do\nthe same here. (So far as we can tell, the New Hampshire Supreme\nCourt has not addressed the status or use of the commentary to the\nABA's Rules of Professional Conduct.)\n\n                                        -18-\n\fHaving made that choice, Whittington had an obligation not to\n\nmisrepresent, affirmatively or by omission, the true value of the\n\nsettlement.   In other words, Whittington's overall conduct created\n\nthe very circumstances under which his failure to act, i.e. his\n\nfailure to inform Sheppard's counsel of the real dollar value of\n\nthe   settlement,   became   a   misrepresentation.   Therefore,   the\n\nmagistrate judge correctly concluded that Whittington's too-artful\n\nwords \"intentionally misled the plaintiffs into believing that\n\nAubin did commit to a $50,000 payment in order to intimidate them\n\ninto a $50,000 settlement in this case.\"6\n\n\n      6\n        In defending his conduct, Whittington refers         to    the\nfollowing language from the ABA Model Code Comments:\n\n      A lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with\n      others on a client's behalf, but generally has no\n      affirmative duty to inform an opposing party of relevant\n      facts. A misrepresentation can occur if the lawyer\n      incorporates or affirms a statement of another person\n      that the lawyer knows is false. Misrepresentation can\n      also occur by act as well as deed. Making a false\n      statement includes the failure to make a statement in\n      circumstances in which nondisclosure is equivalent to\n      making such a statement. Thus, where a lawyer has made a\n      statement that the lawyer believed to be true when made\n      but later discovers that the statement was not true, in\n      some circumstances failure to correct the statement is\n      equivalent to making a statement that is false.\n\nN.H. Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 4.1, ABA Model Code Comments\n(2000).    Whittington emphasizes the statement that a lawyer\n\"generally has no affirmative duty to inform an opposing party of\nrelevant facts.\" Also, he asserts that the last sentence -- which\noutlines a situation where a lawyer makes a statement he later\ndiscovers to be false -- describes the only circumstances in which\na nondisclosure is equivalent to a false statement.\n     The language Whittington cites -- that \"[m]aking a false\nstatement includes the failure to make a statement in circumstances\n\n                                   -19-\n\fB. Monetary sanction\n\n              In   the   magistrate    judge's     view,   Whittington's    \"true\n\npurpose for seeking the protective order\" was to conceal his\n\nunethical conduct, as the magistrate judge saw it, reflected in his\n\nstatements to the Aubin court and his letter to Sheppard’s counsel.\n\nLike the district court, we are not persuaded by this account of\n\nWhittington's motivations.          As the district court wrote:\n\n       Whittington did, after all, offer to file the Aubin\n       settlement documents with the court for in camera\n       inspection--hardly the kind of offer likely to be made by\n       one bent upon concealing his misconduct.     Whittington\n       vigorously denies any such motive, and his actions\n       generally support his denials, as does the general tenor\n       of the record.\n\nAlso, we agree with the district court's observation that \"[i]t is\n\nhighly unlikely that [Whittington] was motivated to file the motion\n\nfor protective order to conceal misconduct he did not (and still\n\ndoes   not)    recognize     as    misconduct.\"         Moreover,   we   have   now\n\nconcluded that Whittington had no reason to conceal his statements\n\nbefore the Aubin court.           In the end, however, his motivation for\n\nseeking   the      protective     order    does   not   matter.     Whatever    his\n\nmotivation, Whittington’s arguments for the order, simply taken at\n\n\nin which nondisclosure is equivalent to making such a statement\" --\nactually captures the wrongfulness of his conduct. The manner in\nwhich Whittington drafted his letter to Sheppard's counsel created\na situation in which his failure to make a statement constituted a\nfalse statement.    Simply because his own actions created the\ncircumstances that gave rise to his duty to disclose does not\nrelieve him of that duty. Finally, it is plainly obvious that the\nlast sentence of the paragraph is one example of a nondisclosure\nthat is equivalent to a false statement, not the only example.\n\n                                          -20-\n\fface value, were so unjustified that he must personally bear the\n\ncosts of opposing it.        The monetary sanction imposed by the\n\nmagistrate judge must therefore stand.\n\n           Motions for protective orders are first governed by Rule\n\n26(c), which provides for the award of expenses if the motion\n\nfails:\n\n      If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole\n      or in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions\n      as are just, order that any party or other person provide\n      or permit discovery. The provisions of Rule 37(a)(4)\n      apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to\n      the motion.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).     Rule 37 provides in relevant part:\n\n      If the motion [to compel] is granted or if the disclosure\n      or requested discovery is provided after the motion was\n      filed, the court shall, after affording opportunity to be\n      heard, require the party . . . whose conduct necessitated\n      the motion [here, Whittington] . . . to pay to the moving\n      party the reasonable expenses incurred in making the\n      motion, including attorney's fees, unless the court finds\n      that the motion was filed without the movant's first\n      making a good faith effort to obtain the disclosure or\n      discovery without court action, or that the opposing\n      party's nondisclosure, response, or objection was\n      substantially justified, or that other circumstances make\n      an award of expenses unjust.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4)(A) (emphasis added).              In a similar\n\ncontext, the Supreme Court has said that \"substantially justified\"\n\ndoes not mean \"justified to a high degree,\" but only \"justified in\n\nsubstance or in the main-–that is, justified to a degree that could\n\nsatisfy a reasonable person.\"     Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552,\n\n565   (1988)   (internal    quotation   marks   omitted)     (construing\n\ngovernment's obligations under Equal Access to Justice Act).\n\n                                 -21-\n\f           The   specific      wording    of   Whittington’s     motion     for\n\nprotective order is important.         Whittington wrote:\n\n     3. Robert Aubin settled his claims by and against\n     defendants--in a different case from this case--in a\n     confidential settlement agreement.    That settlement\n     agreement has no bearing on any of the issues in this\n     case, and is not calculated to lead to admissible\n     evidence.\n\n     4. Settlement agreements with related parties--absent a\n     showing of identity of issues or factual stipulations\n     having bearing on the subsequent case--are generally held\n     inadmissible as not relevant. Centillion Data Systems,\n     Inc. v. Ameritech Corp., 193 F.R.D. 550 (S.D. Ind. 1999);\n     Doe v. Methacton School Dist., 164 F.R.D. 175 (E.D. Pa.\n     1995); Thornton v. Syracuse Saving Bank, 961 F.2d 1042\n     (2d Cir. 1992); Griffin v. Mashariki, 1997 WL 756914\n     (S.D.N.Y. 1997).\n\nWhittington argues in a conclusory way that these four cases\n\nsubstantially justified his position. He complains in passing that\n\nthe magistrate judge never even noted that he had cited them before\n\nimposing sanctions.\n\n           We have examined the cases and find them wanting.                The\n\ngeneral proposition for which Whittington cites them is valid.\n\nHowever,   his   motion   is    more     notable   for   what   it   does   not\n\nacknowledge: namely, that settlement agreements may be used to\n\nimpeach a witness like Aubin, whose testimony–-which, to be sure,\n\nwas supposed to be \"truthful\"--entitles him to a $49,900 discount\n\non a judgment of $50,000.7       This omission is all the more glaring\n\ngiven that the first case he cites makes that very point.                    In\n\n\n     7\n       It appears that, for some reason, Aubin never even paid the\n$100 that he owed.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fCentillion Data Systems, the court carefully noted that \"evidence\n\nof settlement offers and acceptances . . . may be admissible for\n\nother purposes 'such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness.'\"\n\n193 F.R.D. at 553 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 408).                As Whittington had\n\nto know, that is precisely the reason why Sheppard’s counsel was\n\ninterested     in   seeing   the    settlement     agreement         for   herself.\n\nTherefore, while Whittington may have felt no ethical concerns\n\nabout revealing his representations to the Aubin court or his\n\nletter to Sheppard's counsel, he should not have fought disclosure\n\nof a settlement agreement so obviously relevant to the impeachment\n\nof Aubin's testimony in a future trial.              The magistrate judge's\n\ncall on this point was exactly right.\n\nC. Arguments rejected for procedural defects\n\n           At the June 13, 2001 hearing, the magistrate judge\n\nannounced that he would impose certain nonmonetary sanctions on\n\nWhittington,    requiring    at    least    10   hours   of    CLE    credits   and\n\ntutoring     from   Whittington's     attorney      in   ethics.           Although\n\nWhittington says that he is appealing these particular sanctions on\n\nseveral grounds, he has not preserved his right to do so.                   He did\n\nnot object to these sanctions at the hearing or shortly thereafter\n\nin the time provided by Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a).8                   When he filed\n\n\n     8\n       Rule 72(a) provides, for nondispositive rulings like this\none: \"Within 10 days after being served with a copy of the\nmagistrate judge's order, a party may serve and file objections to\nthe order; a party may not thereafter assign as error a defect in\nthe magistrate judge's order to which objection was not timely\n\n                                     -23-\n\fobjections to the magistrate judge's September 27, 2001 order, he\n\ndid not mention the nonmonetary sanctions at all. For that reason,\n\npresumably, the district court did not review them in its January\n\n22, 2004 ruling.       Neither will we.          \"It is a firmly settled rule\n\nthat a party's appeal of a magistrate judge's order to the district\n\ncourt delimits his right to further appellate review.\"                 Phinney,\n\n199 F.3d at 3.       Whittington's failure to appeal these nonmonetary\n\nsanctions     when    he   first   had     the    chance   prevents   him   from\n\nchallenging them now.9\n\n            Whittington is not alone in suffering from a self-\n\ninflicted wound on appeal. On April 12, 2004, the magistrate judge\n\nissued his order fixing the amount that Whittington would have to\n\npay in attorney's fees.         Sheppard now cross-appeals that order as\n\nbeing too small, but she failed to object to that order within Rule\n\n72(a)'s time limit.        Before briefs had been filed in this case,\n\nWhittington     moved      to    dismiss     Sheppard's      cross-appeal    as\n\nunpreserved.    We provisionally denied that motion and ordered the\n\n\nmade.\"\n     9\n       According to Whittington, these nonmonetary sanctions are\nless important to him than the factual findings that we have\naddressed. In any event, as we explained, even if the specific\nnonmonetary sanctions are not appealable, the findings themselves\nare because of their effect on the lawyer's professional reputation\nand because they contributed to the imposition of monetary\nsanctions for Whittington's discovery misconduct in this case.\nAlthough we have vacated the finding based on Whittington's conduct\nin the Aubin case, there remained ample grounds, as we have\nexplained, for the magistrate judge's imposition of a monetary\nsanction for discovery misconduct.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fparties to \"address the issue raised by the motion papers in their\n\nrelevant briefs.\"     Sheppard completely failed to address the issue\n\nin her opening brief, only belatedly doing so in a reply brief.\n\n\"It is well settled in this court, for good reason which need not\n\nbe rehearsed here, that a legal argument made for the first time in\n\nan    appellant's   reply   brief   comes   too    late     and    need   not   be\n\naddressed.\"    Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 354\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).        At this point, the issue raised by Sheppard's\n\ncross-appeal has been forfeited twice-over, and we decline to\n\nconsider it on the merits.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            For the reasons stated, we affirm the award of a monetary\n\nsanction assessed personally against Whittington.                 We also affirm\n\nthe    magistrate   judge's   finding   that      Whittington's       letter    to\n\nSheppard's    counsel    \"intentionally     misled    the    plaintiffs     into\n\nbelieving that Aubin did commit to a $50,000 payment in order to\n\nintimidate them into a $50,000 settlement in this case.\" We vacate\n\nthe magistrate judge's finding that Whittington misrepresented the\n\nsettlement status of the Aubin case when he told the Aubin court\n\nthat the parties were close to settlement but had not yet settled.\n\nCosts are taxed in favor of the appellee.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f",

This is an appeal of a monetary\n\nsanction that was imposed by the magistrate judge on defendants'\n\nlawyer, William E. Whittington IV, for discovery misconduct.            The\n\ncourt required that Whittington personally compensate the opposing\n\nparties for the attorney's fees and costs incurred in opposing a\n\nprotective order that he had obtained.        Citing the injury to his\n\nprofessional reputation, Whittington also appeals certain findings\n\nof fact made by the magistrate judge in support of the monetary\n\nsanction. The district court affirmed the sanction and most of the\n\nfindings.    After a careful review of the record, we affirm the\n\nsanction but vacate a finding that the district court affirmed.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            To explain the genesis of the sanction and findings, we\n\nmust review the history of the underlying case.        River Valley was\n\na health club located in Hanover, New Hampshire.         In early 1999,\n\nMary C. Sheppard, the principal plaintiff in this case, brought a\n\nclaim of sexual harassment against defendants (in essence, the club\n\nand its owners, Joseph and Elizabeth Asch) for offensive incidents\n\nshe said she experienced while working at the club.           The club's\n\nmanager, Robert Aubin, filed a lawsuit of his own, alleging that he\n\nwas fired in retaliation for reporting Sheppard's complaints about\n\nharassment.1     In   both   cases,    defendants   denied   all   of   the\n\n\n\n     1\n       That suit, Aubin v. River Valley Fitness One, LP, was\nassigned to a different district-court judge.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fallegations and filed counterclaims against Sheppard and Aubin,\n\naccusing them of conspiring to fabricate their lawsuits.             In early\n\n2000, the two cases were consolidated for discovery.\n\n           In August 2000, defendants and Aubin discussed settling\n\ntheir dispute (and, shortly thereafter, did settle).           The sanction\n\nin this case and the findings all derive from three instances in\n\nwhich Whittington made claims about the settlement process in the\n\nAubin case.\n\nA.   Whittington's statements to the Aubin court on August 21, 2000\n\n           On August 15, 2000, Whittington sent a letter to Aubin's\n\ncounsel   to,   as   the   letter   put   it,   \"summarize   our   settlement\n\ndiscussions.\"    The letter opened by stating that \"[t]he parties\n\nwill settle on the following terms (subject to details being worked\n\nout on the open items below).\"            The letter provided that \"Aubin\n\nwould agree to a stipulated judgment of $50,000\" in River Valley's\n\nfavor, but that Aubin need pay only $100 of that amount for release\n\nand satisfaction. Also, because River Valley was keenly interested\n\nin getting information from Aubin to help with its dispute with\n\nSheppard, Aubin would provide details of his discussions with\n\nSheppard about their claims.          In addition, River Valley wanted\n\ncorroborating information and documents from two other people,\n\nBarney Brannen and Jack Panzica, who River Valley believed were\n\ninvolved with the alleged conspiracy against it; to that end, River\n\nValley had asked the court for subpoenas.           The letter stated that\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe parties would not file the stipulated settlement with the court\n\nuntil after deposing those two witnesses.                In the meantime, the\n\nparties \"will jointly inform the Court we're close to settlement .\n\n. . and tell the Court that it would help the parties' settlement\n\nnegotiations to get a prompt ruling on the Brannen/Panzica motions,\n\nwhich Aubin will now join.\"            Whittington stressed the importance\n\nthat River Valley placed on Aubin's information by underlining the\n\nfollowing sentence: \"The settlement is contingent upon defendants'\n\nsatisfaction that Aubin is assisting defendants in good faith to\n\nthe best of his ability.\"            The letter closed by stating: \"If the\n\nabove     is   satisfactory,       please   indicate    by   signing   below   and\n\nreturning a copy of this letter.\"           The next day, August 16, Aubin's\n\ncounsel signed her agreement and returned the letter.\n\n               On August 21, 2000, Whittington, as promised, told the\n\nAubin court that the parties were close to settlement:\n\n      The parties advise the Court that they have seriously\n      discussed settlement, that they believe the prospects for\n      settlement are excellent after resolution of the two\n      pending motions [to get information from Brannen and\n      Panzica], and that resolution of the motions will be\n      helpful to the settlement process.\n\nOn October 3, 2000, having resolved the Brannen and Panzica issues2\n\nand     having    obtained     a    satisfactory       affidavit    from   Aubin,\n\n\n\n      2\n       On August 21, 2000, Panzica's attorney told                 the court that\nhis client had no documents responsive to the                      subpoena.   On\nSeptember 13, 2000, the court ordered Brannen to                    turn over his\nresponsive documents, Brannen soon did so, and he                  was deposed on\nSeptember 29.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fWhittington authorized Aubin's counsel to file the stipulated\n\njudgment with the court and release other settlement documents from\n\nescrow. On October 4, 2000, the district court entered judgment in\n\nthe Aubin case.\n\nB. Whittington's letter to Sheppard's counsel on October 6, 2000\n\n           Whittington then tried to put the settlement in Aubin to\n\nhis   clients'    advantage   in    Sheppard.    On   October   6,   2000,\n\nWhittington wrote a letter to Sheppard's counsel, informing her of\n\nthe outcome in the Aubin case.         Whittington's letter did not say\n\nthat River Valley had agreed to accept $100 as satisfaction of a\n\nmuch larger judgment; the letter referred simply to the \"$50,000\n\njudgment.\"       Whittington wrote that it was \"clear\" that, when\n\npresented with the \"extensive evidence\" marshaled by River Valley,\n\n\"Aubin and his counsel saw that the litigation had only one\n\npossible outcome.\"     The letter explained that River Valley was now\n\nalso privy to Aubin's \"inside perspective.\"           Referring to \"the\n\npress's continuing strong interest in the litigation,\" the letter\n\nwarned that Sheppard might be portrayed in an unflattering light\n\n\"once all the facts came out.\"        Consequently, the letter advised,\n\n\"[r]eaching a negotiated settlement promptly\" would help to avoid\n\nthat unpleasant outcome.           The letter expressed River Valley's\n\nwillingness to settle for payment of $50,000 and an affidavit from\n\nSheppard backing up River Valley’s version of the disputed events.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fC.   Whittington's motion for a protective order on March 29, 2001\n\n           Faced with Whittington's letter and wanting to see the\n\nsettlement agreement for herself, Sheppard's counsel filed a motion\n\nto compel its production. On March 29, 2001, Whittington responded\n\nby moving for a protective order, seeking to keep the terms of the\n\nagreement secret.     Claiming that the settlement agreement in Aubin\n\nhad \"no bearing on any of the issues in this case,\" Whittington\n\noffered   to   let   the   court    review    the   documents   in    camera   to\n\ndetermine for itself whether they were relevant to the Sheppard\n\ncase.     If   the   court   did     order    the   agreement's      production,\n\nWhittington asked that access be limited to Sheppard's counsel.\n\n           On March 30, 2001, the magistrate judge in the Sheppard\n\ncase granted the protective order to the extent that it sought\n\ncounsel's-eyes-only review of the settlement agreement.                On April\n\n23, 2001, having now received and read the agreement, Sheppard's\n\ncounsel filed a motion for relief from the protective order,\n\nseeking full freedom to disclose the agreement, and for \"sanctions\n\npursuant to Rule 26(c),\" which governs protective orders.\n\n           That motion led to the sanctions at issue in this case.\n\nOn May 23, 2001, the magistrate judge ordered the settlement\n\nagreement to be unsealed.          Referring to what it called a \"lack of\n\nforthrightness\" on Whittington's part and \"[h]alf-truths about the\n\nAubin settlement,\" the magistrate judge also scheduled a hearing on\n\n\"appropriate sanctions, if any.\"             At the end of that hearing on\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fJune 13, 2001, the magistrate judge said: \"There will be at least\n\none sanction.    Mr. Whittington is going to demonstrate to me that\n\nhe has taken at least 10 hours specifically of CLE related to\n\nprofessional conduct responsibility rules within the next three\n\nmonths.\" Then, addressing the lawyer whom Whittington had retained\n\nfor the hearing, the magistrate judge added: \"And Mr. Daschbach,\n\nyou are to tutor him with regard to how you practice law in the\n\nState of New Hampshire and in this court.\"\n\n             On September 27, 2001, the magistrate judge issued his\n\norder   on   sanctions,   making   three   main   findings.   First,   the\n\nmagistrate judge found that \"Whittington misled the court when he\n\nargued that the Aubin settlement is irrelevant to the issues in\n\nthis case.\"    Aubin's agreement to cooperate with River Valley was\n\n\"directly relevant to Aubin's credibility.\" Second, the magistrate\n\njudge found that \"Whittington intentionally misled the plaintiffs\"\n\nin his October 6, 2000 letter \"to intimidate them into a $50,000\n\nsettlement in this case.\"     Third, the magistrate judge found that\n\nWhittington sought the protective order so as to \"conceal his\n\ndeceptive conduct in the Aubin case\" (i.e., telling the Aubin court\n\nthat the parties were merely \"close\" to a settlement when, in the\n\nmagistrate's view, they had already \"reached a settlement in\n\nprinciple\").     The magistrate judge concluded that Whittington's\n\nmotion for a protective order had not been substantially justified\n\nand ordered a monetary sanction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4):\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fspecifically,   Whittington     \"shall   personally     compensate   the\n\nplaintiffs for their expenses, including reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees, incurred in connection with their opposition to and the\n\nmotion for relief from the protective order.\"\n\n          On January 22, 2004, the district court affirmed the\n\nsanction imposed by the magistrate judge.       The court also found\n\nthat the record \"fully support[ed] the Magistrate Judge's . . .\n\nfindings and conclusions,\" with one exception.        The district court\n\nrejected the magistrate judge's finding that Whittington sought a\n\nprotective order partly \"to conceal his deceptive conduct in the\n\nAubin case.\"    Referring to Whittington's suggestion that the\n\nmagistrate judge inspect the settlement agreement in camera, the\n\ndistrict court noted that this was \"hardly the kind of offer likely\n\nto be made by one bent upon concealing his misconduct.\"              The\n\ndistrict court then referred the matter to the magistrate judge for\n\ncalculation of attorney's fees.\n\n          On April 27, 2004, the magistrate judge issued an order\n\nassessing $6,538 in fees.     On May 25, 2004, the district court\n\nentered judgment in the case.    On June 16, 2004, Whittington filed\n\nthis timely appeal, asking that we vacate the sanctions and set\n\naside the magistrate judge's findings about his misconduct before\n\nthe Aubin court and in his letter to Sheppard’s counsel.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          We have jurisdiction to review the sanction in this case\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fas an appeal from a final decision of the district court.

We can review the underlying factual findings as\n\nwell.    \"The imposition of a sanction on an attorney is universally\n\nregarded       as    an       order,   and,      if     an     appellate      tribunal      has\n\njurisdiction         to    review      such   an      order,     its    examination      will\n\nencompass the underlying findings.\"                     Williams v.

We apply\n\nthat logic to our review of the sanction and findings at issue\n\nhere.\n\nA. Factual findings\n\n           1. Whittington's statements to the Aubin court\n\n           We first examine the magistrate judge's finding that\n\nWhittington misrepresented the settlement status of the Aubin case\n\nwhen he told the Aubin court that the parties were close to\n\nsettlement (\"the prospects for settlement are excellent\") but had\n\nnot yet settled.\n\n           Before we reach the merits of this issue, however, we\n\nreject at the outset Whittington's argument that the magistrate\n\njudge   somehow    lacked   jurisdiction   to   make   findings     (which\n\nWhittington here calls \"sanctions\") about his conduct in the Aubin\n\ncase.   These cases--Sheppard and Aubin--are closely related.         They\n\nhave a common defendant, River Valley.      Aubin alleged that he was\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\ffired in retaliation for reporting Sheppard's complaints about\n\nharassment.    The cases were consolidated for discovery before the\n\nsame magistrate judge.\n\n            True, it would be odd for Sheppard to win her attorney's\n\nfees and costs for Whittington's conduct in a case to which she was\n\nnot a party.    However, that is not what happened here.         Sheppard\n\nsought    compensation   for   costs     incurred   in   challenging   the\n\nprotective order in her case.      In considering that request, the\n\nmagistrate judge had to look at Whittington's conduct in Aubin to\n\nevaluate what Whittington was trying to achieve with a protective\n\norder in Sheppard.    Moreover, Whittington himself made the events\n\nsurrounding the Aubin settlement an issue in this case when he\n\ndecided to try to use that settlement to encourage settlement here,\n\ntoo.     The magistrate judge's findings of fact, including the\n\nfinding about Whittington's conduct in the Aubin case, were all\n\nrelated to his decision to impose sanctions for Whittington's\n\ndiscovery misconduct in this case.\n\n            We now examine the merits of the finding at issue.          In\n\nhis September 27, 2001 order, the magistrate judge said that\n\nWhittington, when he told the Aubin court that the parties were\n\nclose to settlement instead of settled, had engaged in \"deceptive\n\nconduct\" and \"misrepresentations\" before the Aubin court.              The\n\ndistrict court, for its part, said that Whittington’s conduct\n\n       certainly qualifies as \"sharp practice,\" well outside the\n       boundaries of complete and full candor owed to the court\n\n                                  -11-\n\f     by those who practice in this district.3      At worst,\n     counsel intentionally sought to mislead the court with\n     regard to the actual settlement status of the Aubin case\n     in order to obtain rulings on pending motions that\n     otherwise probably would not have been made.\n\nIn this instance, we cannot agree with such a harsh view of\n\nWhittington's conduct.\n\n          First and foremost, we take seriously River Valley's\n\nconcerns, expressed in the letter to Aubin's counsel, about being\n\nable to corroborate Aubin's testimony with information obtained\n\nfrom Brannen and Panzica.      The magistrate judge dismissed that\n\nconcern, writing that \"[n]othing in the settlement documents even\n\nsuggests that this is true.\"    But Whittington's letter to Aubin’s\n\n\n\n     3\n       The Rules of Professional Conduct of the New Hampshire\nSupreme Court are the relevant ethical standards for lawyers\npracticing before the United States District Court for the District\nof New Hampshire. See D.N.H.R. 83.5 DR-1. All lawyers have a duty\nof candor to the tribunal, which is violated by \"knowingly\" making\na \"false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal.\" N.H.\nRules of Prof'l Conduct R. 3.3(a)(1).\n     Although neither the magistrate judge nor the district court\nreferred to specific rules of New Hampshire's Rules of Professional\nConduct in their analysis of Whittington's conduct, it is apparent\nto us that the rules informed their analysis of that conduct. In\ntheir briefs on appeal, the parties also rely on those rules and\ncommentary to the ABA's Code of Professional Responsibility, see\ninfra, fn. 5, in defending and criticizing Whittington's conduct.\nWe also refer to the rules and that commentary in evaluating\nWhittington's conduct.    However, in making his findings about\nWhittington's conduct, the magistrate judge did not explicitly make\na finding that a specific rule of New Hampshire's Rules of\nProfessional Conduct had been violated and neither did the district\ncourt. We take a similar approach here, focusing our analysis only\non the factual findings of the magistrate judge. As noted above,\nfactual findings themselves about unprofessional conduct can be the\nsubject of appeal because of the \"serious practical consequences\"\nthey have on counsel's reputation. Obert, 398 F.3d at 143.\n\n                                -12-\n\fcounsel    could       hardly    have       been    clearer     when    it    stated       that\n\n\"settlement is contingent upon defendants' satisfaction that Aubin\n\nis assisting defendants in good faith to the best of his ability.\"\n\nThat statement came at the end of a paragraph stressing River\n\nValley's interest in Aubin's \"actions/discussions\" with Brannen and\n\nPanzica.        Two    paragraphs       later,       the   letter      referred       to    the\n\nimportance of \"getting a ruling on the Brannen and Panzica motions,\n\nand     defendants      receiving        their       documents       and     taking      their\n\ndepositions.\"           Read    fairly      in     context,     these      statements      are\n\nevidence of River Valley's reluctance to settle until it had\n\nexhausted       its    ability    to    corroborate        Aubin's      affidavit.          As\n\nWhittington argues, \"no prudent litigant in these circumstances\n\nwould have given up leverage by settling just before obtaining the\n\ncooperation       it    was    bargaining          for.\"      Thus    it    was   fair     for\n\nWhittington       to    characterize         the     parties     as     being     close     to\n\nsettlement after the August 15, 2001 letter, but not yet settled.\n\n            The magistrate judge placed considerable emphasis on the\n\nnotion that the parties would have reached a settlement regardless\n\nof what happened with the pending discovery motions.                                  At the\n\nsanctions hearing, Whittington said that he believed that the case\n\nwould    have    settled       even    if    River     Valley    had       been   unable    to\n\ncorroborate       Aubin’s       affidavit.           But   Whittington's          post     hoc\n\nspeculation, even if accurate, does not tell us much about how\n\nclose the parties were to a final settlement.                        To the contrary, in\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\falmost any negotiation, a lawyer would presumably begin with\n\nvarious ambitions that he hopes to realize in the end--a best-case\n\nscenario, as it were.   Yet at the same time, he may be able to\n\nconcede privately that his client is still better off settling even\n\nif it proves too difficult to secure some particular favorable\n\nconcession or other benefit.   Presumably, Whittington simply meant\n\nthat River Valley's ability to corroborate the affidavit of an\n\nuntrusted adversary was one such aim: valuable if he could get it,\n\nbut not a deal-breaker if he could not.    Importantly, Whittington\n\nnever said that River Valley would have settled if the information\n\nfrom Brannen and Panzica had fatally undermined Aubin's affidavit\n\nor critically impeached his credibility.\n\n          We are given further pause by the magistrate judge's own\n\nsomewhat varying descriptions of the settlement status in Aubin.\n\nAt one point, for example, the magistrate judge describes the\n\nAugust 15, 2001 letter as, if not a true settlement, then at least\n\na \"settlement in principle.\"   A \"settlement in principle\" may well\n\nhave justified Whittington's statement to the court that \"the\n\nprospects for settlement are excellent after resolution of the two\n\npending motions.\"   In the same vein, the magistrate judge wrote:\n\n\"Even if the Aubin matter was not settled on August 16, it was\n\nsettled prior to the court's September 12, 2000 ruling on the\n\nBrannen motion.\"    But in that case, then, it was not wrong for\n\nWhittington to describe the parties as close to settlement on\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fAugust 16.    Anyway, it seems to us that a finding of ethical\n\nmisconduct,   so   fraught    with   consequences   for   a   lawyer's\n\nprofessional reputation, should not rest on such fine distinctions.\n\nIf the court has trouble coming to an unqualified conclusion about\n\nthe parties' settlement status, then Whittington can hardly be\n\ncharged with telling a knowing falsehood--the standard set forth by\n\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct--under such circumstances.\n\n           Similarly, we are reluctant to affirm a finding of\n\nunethical conduct on the basis of a foray into contract law.       The\n\ndistrict court described the letter agreement as being a\n\n     settlement subject to a few conditions subsequent. . . .\n     Had those conditions not been met, perhaps defendants\n     could rescind the agreement and declare the settlement\n     null and void.\n\nIn the district court's view, \"there was nothing of substance left\n\nto negotiate,\" although in truth the settlement may not have been\n\n\"fully accomplished.\"    This conclusion, though--that the letter\n\nagreement may have had some legal force--seems to us to miss the\n\npoint.   Even though the letter agreement may have been enforceable\n\nin some circumstances, many contingencies remained.           The most\n\ncrucial legal documents--the mutual releases, Aubin's affidavit,\n\nthe stipulated judgment--had not even been drafted, let alone\n\nsigned or delivered.    In short, given the evident uncertainties\n\nthat remained, we conclude that Whittington gave a reasonably apt\n\nsummary of the situation when he advised the court that settlement\n\nwith Aubin was close.        The magistrate judge's finding to the\n\n                                 -15-\n\fcontrary was erroneous.\n\n          2. Letter to Sheppard's counsel\n\n          In this second finding, the magistrate judge found that\n\n\"[i]n his October 6 letter, Whittington intentionally misled the\n\nplaintiffs into believing that Aubin did commit to a $50,000\n\npayment in order to intimidate them into a $50,000 settlement in\n\nthis case.\"4   In that letter, Whittington wrote:\n\n     Attached please find a Stipulation to Judgment signed by\n     Judge Barbadoro on October 4 in the amount of $50,000 in\n     RVC’s [River Valley’s] favor in the Aubin case. It is\n     clear that, when presented with the extensive evidence\n     that we have compiled in support of our counterclaims\n     against him and our motion for summary judgment on his\n     own claims, Aubin and his counsel saw that the litigation\n     had only one possible outcome.\n\n     The $50,000 judgment, and the likelihood that it will\n     soon become public, prompt us to re-visit with you the\n     subject of settlement.\n\nHe then stated River Valley’s willingness to settle for \"[p]ayment\n\nof $50,000 by the Sheppards to [River Valley],\" among other demands\n\nsimilar to the Aubin settlement (for example, a truthful affidavit\n\nconfirming River Valley's version of events).   He never disclosed\n\nthat the true cost of the settlement for Aubin was $100.\n\n          New Hampshire's Rules of Professional Conduct impose a\n\nduty of truthfulness on lawyers with respect to people other than\n\n\n\n     4\n       The magistrate judge also noted that Whittington made this\nrepresentation not only to opposing counsel, but to the court as\nwell. In River Valley's motion for summary judgment, a footnote\nreferred to the $50,000 judgment without saying that it could be\nsatisfied for $100.\n\n                               -16-\n\fthe tribunal.           Again, the Rules prohibit knowing falsehoods.           See\n\nN.H.       Rules   of    Prof'l   Conduct   R.   4.1(a)   (\"In   the   course    of\n\nrepresenting a client a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false\n\nstatement of material fact or law to a third person. . . .\").                   The\n\ncommentary accompanying New Hampshire Rule 4.1 in effect at the\n\ntime states that \"[m]aking a false statement includes the failure\n\nto make a statement in circumstances in which nondisclosure is\n\nequivalent to making such a statement.\"                   N.H. Rules of Prof'l\n\nConduct R. 4.1, ABA Model Code Comments (2000).                  The magistrate\n\njudge's       finding      that   Whittington's     omission     constituted      a\n\nmisrepresentation is consistent with the commentary's elaboration\n\nof Rule 4.1.5\n\n\n       5\n       Before the ABA promulgated the Model Rules of Professional\nConduct in 1983, which many states have now adopted wholesale or\npiecemeal, the ABA had promulgated the Code of Professional\nResponsibility, also known as the Model Code. Following a period\nduring which New Hampshire lawyers were subject to the Model Code,\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court adopted the present Rules of\nProfessional Conduct, also known as the Model Rules, effective\nFebruary 1, 1986. There is ABA commentary to both the Model Code\nand the Model Rules. Oddly, publications setting forth the New\nHampshire Rules of Professional Conduct include commentary that\naccompanied the now supplanted Code of Professional Responsibility,\ni.e. the \"ABA Model Code Comments\". Although the New Hampshire\nSupreme Court has never formally adopted these comments, it has\nstated that \"Although the text of each rule is authoritative, the\ncomments are intended as guides to interpretation.\" Carpenito's\nCase, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 173 (N.H. 1994).\n     Therefore, the Model Code commentary can inform judgments\nabout the professional conduct of an attorney in New Hampshire. In\nfact, this is how it appears the New Hampshire Supreme Court uses\nthe \"ABA Model Code Comments,\" in the wake of the switch from the\nCode to the Rules.     See e.g., Carpenito's Case, supra; In re\nCoffey's Case, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413 (N.H. 2005); In re Richmond's\nCase, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158-59 (N.H. 2005). As we noted in footnote 3,\n\n                                        -17-\n\f          It is evident from the letter, read in its entirety, that\n\nWhittington wanted Sheppard to believe that the Aubin case had\n\nsettled for a payment of $50,000.          True, Whittington did not say so\n\nexplicitly.    However, he managed to convey that impression anyway\n\nby selecting certain words and omitting certain details with\n\nstudied precision.       As the district court wrote: \"[T]he words used\n\n(and not used) by Whittington seem carefully chosen, and, if\n\ndissected and construed from a minimalist point of view, are\n\ndefensible    as    'literally    true.'        But   it   is   likewise    plainly\n\napparent that those words were meant to convey more.\"                  After all,\n\nthe letter's purpose--to encourage Sheppard to pay $50,000 to\n\nsettle her case--depended considerably on leaving the impression\n\nthat Aubin, in a similar position, had already committed to doing\n\nthe same thing.\n\n          We       are   not   saying    that    Whittington     had   a    general\n\nobligation to disclose the full terms of the Aubin settlement to\n\nSheppard just by mentioning the fact of the settlement.                    However,\n\nWhittington did more than that.                He chose to disclose the face\n\ndollar value of the judgment against Sheppard without disclosing\n\nthe real dollar value of the settlement, in an attempt to induce\n\nSheppard to settle on terms comparable to the Aubin judgment.\n\n\nthat appears to be what the magistrate judge and the district court\ndid here. The parties took a similar approach on appeal, and we do\nthe same here. (So far as we can tell, the New Hampshire Supreme\nCourt has not addressed the status or use of the commentary to the\nABA's Rules of Professional Conduct.)\n\n                                        -18-\n\fHaving made that choice, Whittington had an obligation not to\n\nmisrepresent, affirmatively or by omission, the true value of the\n\nsettlement.   In other words, Whittington's overall conduct created\n\nthe very circumstances under which his failure to act, i.e. his\n\nfailure to inform Sheppard's counsel of the real dollar value of\n\nthe   settlement,   became   a   misrepresentation.   Therefore,   the\n\nmagistrate judge correctly concluded that Whittington's too-artful\n\nwords \"intentionally misled the plaintiffs into believing that\n\nAubin did commit to a $50,000 payment in order to intimidate them\n\ninto a $50,000 settlement in this case.\"6\n\n\n      6\n        In defending his conduct, Whittington refers         to    the\nfollowing language from the ABA Model Code Comments:\n\n      A lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with\n      others on a client's behalf, but generally has no\n      affirmative duty to inform an opposing party of relevant\n      facts. A misrepresentation can occur if the lawyer\n      incorporates or affirms a statement of another person\n      that the lawyer knows is false. Misrepresentation can\n      also occur by act as well as deed. Making a false\n      statement includes the failure to make a statement in\n      circumstances in which nondisclosure is equivalent to\n      making such a statement. Thus, where a lawyer has made a\n      statement that the lawyer believed to be true when made\n      but later discovers that the statement was not true, in\n      some circumstances failure to correct the statement is\n      equivalent to making a statement that is false.\n\nN.H. Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 4.1, ABA Model Code Comments\n(2000).    Whittington emphasizes the statement that a lawyer\n\"generally has no affirmative duty to inform an opposing party of\nrelevant facts.\" Also, he asserts that the last sentence -- which\noutlines a situation where a lawyer makes a statement he later\ndiscovers to be false -- describes the only circumstances in which\na nondisclosure is equivalent to a false statement.\n     The language Whittington cites -- that \"[m]aking a false\nstatement includes the failure to make a statement in circumstances\n\n                                   -19-\n\fB. Monetary sanction\n\n              In   the   magistrate    judge's     view,   Whittington's    \"true\n\npurpose for seeking the protective order\" was to conceal his\n\nunethical conduct, as the magistrate judge saw it, reflected in his\n\nstatements to the Aubin court and his letter to Sheppard’s counsel.\n\nLike the district court, we are not persuaded by this account of\n\nWhittington's motivations.          As the district court wrote:\n\n       Whittington did, after all, offer to file the Aubin\n       settlement documents with the court for in camera\n       inspection--hardly the kind of offer likely to be made by\n       one bent upon concealing his misconduct.     Whittington\n       vigorously denies any such motive, and his actions\n       generally support his denials, as does the general tenor\n       of the record.\n\nAlso, we agree with the district court's observation that \"[i]t is\n\nhighly unlikely that [Whittington] was motivated to file the motion\n\nfor protective order to conceal misconduct he did not (and still\n\ndoes   not)    recognize     as    misconduct.\"         Moreover,   we   have   now\n\nconcluded that Whittington had no reason to conceal his statements\n\nbefore the Aubin court.           In the end, however, his motivation for\n\nseeking   the      protective     order    does   not   matter.     Whatever    his\n\nmotivation, Whittington’s arguments for the order, simply taken at\n\n\nin which nondisclosure is equivalent to making such a statement\" --\nactually captures the wrongfulness of his conduct. The manner in\nwhich Whittington drafted his letter to Sheppard's counsel created\na situation in which his failure to make a statement constituted a\nfalse statement.    Simply because his own actions created the\ncircumstances that gave rise to his duty to disclose does not\nrelieve him of that duty. Finally, it is plainly obvious that the\nlast sentence of the paragraph is one example of a nondisclosure\nthat is equivalent to a false statement, not the only example.\n\n                                          -20-\n\fface value, were so unjustified that he must personally bear the\n\ncosts of opposing it.        The monetary sanction imposed by the\n\nmagistrate judge must therefore stand.\n\n           Motions for protective orders are first governed by Rule\n\n26(c), which provides for the award of expenses if the motion\n\nfails:\n\n      If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole\n      or in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions\n      as are just, order that any party or other person provide\n      or permit discovery. The provisions of Rule 37(a)(4)\n      apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to\n      the motion.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).     Rule 37 provides in relevant part:\n\n      If the motion [to compel] is granted or if the disclosure\n      or requested discovery is provided after the motion was\n      filed, the court shall, after affording opportunity to be\n      heard, require the party . . . whose conduct necessitated\n      the motion [here, Whittington] . . . to pay to the moving\n      party the reasonable expenses incurred in making the\n      motion, including attorney's fees, unless the court finds\n      that the motion was filed without the movant's first\n      making a good faith effort to obtain the disclosure or\n      discovery without court action, or that the opposing\n      party's nondisclosure, response, or objection was\n      substantially justified, or that other circumstances make\n      an award of expenses unjust.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4)(A) (emphasis added).              In a similar\n\ncontext, the Supreme Court has said that \"substantially justified\"\n\ndoes not mean \"justified to a high degree,\" but only \"justified in\n\nsubstance or in the main-–that is, justified to a degree that could\n\nsatisfy a reasonable person.\"     Pierce v.

He complains in passing that\n\nthe magistrate judge never even noted that he had cited them before\n\nimposing sanctions.\n\n           We have examined the cases and find them wanting.                The\n\ngeneral proposition for which Whittington cites them is valid.\n\nHowever,   his   motion   is    more     notable   for   what   it   does   not\n\nacknowledge: namely, that settlement agreements may be used to\n\nimpeach a witness like Aubin, whose testimony–-which, to be sure,\n\nwas supposed to be \"truthful\"--entitles him to a $49,900 discount\n\non a judgment of $50,000.7       This omission is all the more glaring\n\ngiven that the first case he cites makes that very point.                    In\n\n\n     7\n       It appears that, for some reason, Aubin never even paid the\n$100 that he owed.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fCentillion Data Systems, the court carefully noted that \"evidence\n\nof settlement offers and acceptances . . . may be admissible for\n\nother purposes 'such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness.'\"\n\n193 F.R.D. at 553 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 408).                As Whittington had\n\nto know, that is precisely the reason why Sheppard’s counsel was\n\ninterested     in   seeing   the    settlement     agreement         for   herself.\n\nTherefore, while Whittington may have felt no ethical concerns\n\nabout revealing his representations to the Aubin court or his\n\nletter to Sheppard's counsel, he should not have fought disclosure\n\nof a settlement agreement so obviously relevant to the impeachment\n\nof Aubin's testimony in a future trial.              The magistrate judge's\n\ncall on this point was exactly right.\n\nC. Arguments rejected for procedural defects\n\n           At the June 13, 2001 hearing, the magistrate judge\n\nannounced that he would impose certain nonmonetary sanctions on\n\nWhittington,    requiring    at    least    10   hours   of    CLE    credits   and\n\ntutoring     from   Whittington's     attorney      in   ethics.           Although\n\nWhittington says that he is appealing these particular sanctions on\n\nseveral grounds, he has not preserved his right to do so.                   He did\n\nnot object to these sanctions at the hearing or shortly thereafter\n\nin the time provided by Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a).8                   When he filed\n\n\n     8\n       Rule 72(a) provides, for nondispositive rulings like this\none: \"Within 10 days after being served with a copy of the\nmagistrate judge's order, a party may serve and file objections to\nthe order; a party may not thereafter assign as error a defect in\nthe magistrate judge's order to which objection was not timely\n\n                                     -23-\n\fobjections to the magistrate judge's September 27, 2001 order, he\n\ndid not mention the nonmonetary sanctions at all. For that reason,\n\npresumably, the district court did not review them in its January\n\n22, 2004 ruling.       Neither will we.          \"It is a firmly settled rule\n\nthat a party's appeal of a magistrate judge's order to the district\n\ncourt delimits his right to further appellate review.\"                 Phinney,\n\n199 F.3d at 3.       Whittington's failure to appeal these nonmonetary\n\nsanctions     when    he   first   had     the    chance   prevents   him   from\n\nchallenging them now.9\n\n            Whittington is not alone in suffering from a self-\n\ninflicted wound on appeal. On April 12, 2004, the magistrate judge\n\nissued his order fixing the amount that Whittington would have to\n\npay in attorney's fees.         Sheppard now cross-appeals that order as\n\nbeing too small, but she failed to object to that order within Rule\n\n72(a)'s time limit.        Before briefs had been filed in this case,\n\nWhittington     moved      to    dismiss     Sheppard's      cross-appeal    as\n\nunpreserved.    We provisionally denied that motion and ordered the\n\n\nmade.\"\n     9\n       According to Whittington, these nonmonetary sanctions are\nless important to him than the factual findings that we have\naddressed. In any event, as we explained, even if the specific\nnonmonetary sanctions are not appealable, the findings themselves\nare because of their effect on the lawyer's professional reputation\nand because they contributed to the imposition of monetary\nsanctions for Whittington's discovery misconduct in this case.\nAlthough we have vacated the finding based on Whittington's conduct\nin the Aubin case, there remained ample grounds, as we have\nexplained, for the magistrate judge's imposition of a monetary\nsanction for discovery misconduct.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fparties to \"address the issue raised by the motion papers in their\n\nrelevant briefs.\"     Sheppard completely failed to address the issue\n\nin her opening brief, only belatedly doing so in a reply brief.\n\n\"It is well settled in this court, for good reason which need not\n\nbe rehearsed here, that a legal argument made for the first time in\n\nan    appellant's   reply   brief   comes   too    late     and    need   not   be\n\naddressed.\"    Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).        At this point, the issue raised by Sheppard's\n\ncross-appeal has been forfeited twice-over, and we decline to\n\nconsider it on the merits.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            For the reasons stated, we affirm the award of a monetary\n\nsanction assessed personally against Whittington.                 We also affirm\n\nthe    magistrate   judge's   finding   that      Whittington's       letter    to\n\nSheppard's    counsel    \"intentionally     misled    the    plaintiffs     into\n\nbelieving that Aubin did commit to a $50,000 payment in order to\n\nintimidate them into a $50,000 settlement in this case.\" We vacate\n\nthe magistrate judge's finding that Whittington misrepresented the\n\nsettlement status of the Aubin case when he told the Aubin court\n\nthat the parties were close to settlement but had not yet settled.\n\nCosts are taxed in favor of the appellee.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f</pre>",
