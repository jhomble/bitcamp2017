Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                       \n\n                                          \n\n                              Before\n\n                      Cyr, Boudin and Stahl,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n                                       \n\n                                          \n\n     Eric V. Bleicken on brief pro se.\n                     \n\n                                          \n\n                                          \n\n     Per Curiam.  Pro se plaintiff Eric Bleicken appeals from the\n                        \n\ndismissal of  his 42  U.S.C.  1983 complaint  for the  failure to\n\nstate  a  claim  upon  which relief  can  be  granted.    We have\n\nthoroughly  reviewed the  record  and Bleicken's  submissions  on\n\nappeal.   We affirm the dismissal  for the reasons stated  in the\n\nmagistrate  judge's  report  and recommendation  of  February 12,\n\n1993.   We  add  that,  where none  of  the appellant's  prolific\n\nfilings demonstrate that he was ever incarcerated for contempt as\n\na result of  his failure to pay  child support, he has  failed to\n\nstate a claim for damages for  violation of his alleged right  to\n\ncounsel.  The Supreme Court has stated that \"actual imprisonment\"\n\nis the \"line defining the constitutional right to appointment  of\n\ncounsel.\"   See Scott  v. Illinois, 440  U.S. 367,  373-74 (1979)\n                                  \n\n(applying Sixth  and Fourteenth  Amendments in  context of  state\n\ncriminal proceeding).  Since Bleicken has not alleged that he was\n\nimprisoned, he has failed to state  a claim for violation of this\n\nright.  \n\n     To the  extent the complaint  might be construed to  state a\n\nclaim   for   equitable    relief   against   Bleicken's   future\n\nincarceration for  nonsupport absent appointed counsel, the claim\n\nis too  speculative.   Should  Bleicken be  subjected to  further\n\ncontempt proceedings for nonsupport, he may assert indigence as a\n\ndefense.  If he loses and  is incarcerated, he may appeal to  the\n\nNew Hampshire Supreme Court and, if need be, to the Supreme Court\n\nof the United States. See Henkel v. Bradshaw, 483 F.2d 1386, 1390\n                                            \n\n                               -2-\n\n(4th Cir. 1973).   If he remains  incarcerated, he may then  seek\n\nfederal habeas relief.  Compare Mann v. Hendrian, 871 F.2d 51, 53\n                                                \n\n(7th Cir.  1989)(affirming dismissal of 42 U.S.C.   1983 suit for\n\ndeclaratory  and injunctive  relief  against state  court judge's\n\nalleged  policy of  refusing  to  appoint  counsel  for  indigent\n\ndefendants subject  to contempt  proceedings for  failure to  pay\n\nchild support).  However, the  present complaint does not state a\n\nclaim  for  injunctive   relief  or  damages  for   violation  of\n\nBleicken's alleged right to counsel.\n\n     Bleicken's remaining claims are too numerous to recount.  By\n\nand large, they allege violations  of state law without reference\n\nto federal rights.  These alleged violations of New Hampshire law\n\ndo  not  state  claims for  constitutional  violations actionable\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.  1983. See Malachowski v. City of Keene, 787 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n704,  708 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 828 (1986).  Indeed,\n                                  \n\nthe  complaint  essentially  seeks  relief from  numerous  orders\n\nentered by the New Hampshire superior court in Bleicken's divorce\n\nand  child custody dispute, particularly the child support order.\n\n\"It is  crystal  clear  that  we  lack  appellate  or  non-habeas\n\njurisdiction over  decisions of  the courts  of any  state ....\".\n\nRivera-Puig  v.  Garcia-Rosario, 983  F.2d  311, 317    (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1992).  These  asserted claims of error  were properly dismissed.\n\nSee Lancellotti v. Fay, 909 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                      \n\n     The  district court did  not specifically address Bleicken's\n\nclaim  that   Judges  Perkins,  Morrill   and  Commissioner  King\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nconspired  to extort Ellene  Bleicken's share of  the proceeds of\n\nthe  sale of  the marital  home to  prevent Bleicken  from hiring\n\ncounsel.  Bleicken's complaint also may be construed as  alleging\n\nthat all of the  defendants conspired against him as  a result of\n\n\"gender   bias\"  and  \"prosecutorial  vindictiveness.\"      These\n\nconspiracy   allegations   are   wholly   conclusory   and   thus\n\ninsufficient.   See Slotnick v.  Staviskey, 560 F.2d 31,  33 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1077 (1978).\n                        \n\n     We  also agree  with the  district  court's conclusion  that\n\ndefendants  Perkins,  Morrill,  Carlson,  Vaughan  and King  were\n\nentitled  to  absolute  immunity for  their  judicial  and quasi-\n\njudicial acts.  See  Cok v. Cosentino, 876 F.2d 1,  2-3 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1989)(per  curiam).   While  Bleicken  has  made  the  conclusory\n\nassertion that certain of the defendant judges knowingly acted in\n\nexcess  of their jurisdiction, his factual allegations belie this\n\nassertion and fail to establish  a clear absence of  jurisdiction\n\nsufficient to overcome the defendant judges' immunity.1\n\n     Finally,  we reiterate that  this circuit \"do[es]  not allow\n\nnon-lawyers to represent litigants other than themselves.\"  Amman\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n1.  To the extent that Bleicken's claim against defendant Vaughan\nis predicated on her testimony at the custody hearing, Vaughan is\nentitled to  witness immunity.  See Briscoe v.  LaHue,   460 U.S.\n                                                     \n325, 329 (1983).  And to  the extent Bleicken  seeks to hold  the\nchief justices of the  New Hampshire superior and  supreme courts\nliable for  the acts  of other justices,  there is  no respondeat\nsuperior   liability  under  42  U.S.C.   1983.    See  Pinto  v.\n                                                             \nNettleship, 737  F.2d 130,  132 (1st  Cir. 1984). These  justices\n          \nremain  immune  from   liability  for  the  decisions   of  their\nrespective courts.\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nv.  Stow School  System,,  982  F.2d 644,  648  (1st Cir.  1992).\n                        \n\nAccordingly, this appeal  has been allowed to proceed  as to Eric\n\nBleicken  alone.   This  principle  also  supports  the  district\n\ncourt's  dismissal of Bleicken's equal protection claim on behalf\n\nof his daughter  Maliaka.  Insofar as Bleicken  also purported to\n\nstate claims on behalf of his deceased mother and other children,\n\nthese claims also were properly dismissed. \n\n                    Judgment affirmed.2   \n                                      \n\n                    \n\n2.  The appellant's motion to amend his brief is denied.\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n",

Fay, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545204\"><a href=\"/opinion/545204/alfred-lancellotti-v-honorable-thomas-f-fay-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not specifically address Bleicken's claim that Judges Perkins, Morrill and Commissioner King conspired to extort Ellene Bleicken's share of the proceeds of the sale of the marital home to prevent Bleicken from hiring counsel.  Bleicken's complaint also may be construed as alleging that all of the defendants conspired against him as a result of \"gender bias\" and \"prosecutorial vindictiveness.\"  These conspiracy allegations are wholly conclusory and thus insufficient.   See Slotnick v. Staviskey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"348311\"><a href=\"/opinion/348311/lester-slotnick-v-harold-staviskey/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1077</span></span> (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also agree with the district court's conclusion that defendants Perkins, Morrill, Carlson, Vaughan and King were entitled to absolute immunity for their judicial and quasi-judicial acts.   See Cok v. Cosentino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524126\"><a href=\"/opinion/524126/dr-gladys-cok-v-louis-cosentino/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1989)(per curiam).  While Bleicken has made the conclusory assertion that certain of the defendant judges knowingly acted in excess of their jurisdiction, his factual allegations belie this assertion and fail to establish a clear absence of jurisdiction sufficient to overcome the defendant judges' immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reiterate that this circuit \"do[es] not allow non-lawyers to represent litigants other than themselves.\"  Amman v.  Stow School System,, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597411\"><a href=\"/opinion/597411/christopher-amann-v-stow-school-system/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span>, 648 (1st Cir. 1992).  Accordingly, this appeal has been allowed to proceed as to Eric Bleicken alone.  This principle also supports the district court's dismissal of Bleicken's equal protection claim on behalf of his daughter Maliaka.  Insofar as Bleicken also purported to state claims on behalf of his deceased mother and other children, these claims also were properly dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To the extent that Bleicken's claim against defendant Vaughan is predicated on her testimony at the custody hearing, Vaughan is entitled to witness immunity.   See Briscoe v. LaHue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110885\"><a href=\"/opinion/110885/briscoe-v-lahue/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 329 (1983).  And to the extent Bleicken seeks to hold the chief justices of the New Hampshire superior and supreme courts liable for the acts of other justices, there is no respondeat superior liability under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.   See Pinto v. Nettleship, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437455\"><a href=\"/opinion/437455/ramon-rondon-pinto-v-carlos-jimenez-nettleship-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 132 (1st Cir. 1984).  These justices remain immune from liability for the decisions of their respective courts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant's motion to amend his brief is denied</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
