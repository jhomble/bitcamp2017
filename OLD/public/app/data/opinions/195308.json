Defendant-appellant  Gerardo Tirado-\n                     \n\nTorres appeals  from the sentence imposed  upon him following\n\nhis  guilty plea, arguing, inter alia, that he is entitled to\n                                     \n\nan   additional  point   reduction  for  his   acceptance  of\n\nresponsibility  and  that  he   is  entitled  to  a  downward\n\ndeparture  for  his  assistance  to  government  authorities.\n\nFinding no error, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          Defendant   established    business   colleges   at\n\ndifferent   locations   and  fraudulently   obtained  federal\n\neducation  funds, mostly  Pell Grants.   He  then used  these\n\nfunds for his own private, non-educational purposes.  Through\n\nthe  scheme,   defendant   improperly  obtained   more   than\n\n$2,500,000.   A fifteen-count  indictment charged him  with a\n\nvariety of  offenses  involving the  manipulation of  federal\n\nfunds.  On the day before trial, he pleaded guilty to four of\n\nthe counts.\n\n          As  part of  the  plea  agreement,  the  government\n\nagreed  to consider  filing a  motion for  downward departure\n\ndepending  on   the  degree  of  defendant's   assistance  to\n\ngovernment authorities.  Prior to the day of sentencing,  the\n\ngovernment  filed such  a  motion pursuant  to United  States\n\nSentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\")   5K1.1.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          Based on the offenses covered by the four counts to\n\nwhich defendant pleaded,  he began with a base  offense level\n\n(BOL) of six, pursuant  to U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(a).   Because the\n\nfraudulent  scheme resulted  in losses  to the  government in\n\nexcess of  $2,500,000, a thirteen-level upward adjustment was\n\nmade  to the BOL pursuant  to U.S.S.G.    2F1.1(b)(1)(N).  In\n\naddition, a further two-level  upward adjustment was made for\n\nmore than minimal planning under U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(2)(A); a\n\nfour-level  upward adjustment was  added based on appellant's\n\nrole  in the offense pursuant  to U.S.S.G.    3B1.1(a); and a\n\ntwo-level upward adjustment was added for abuse of a position\n\nof trust under U.S.S.G.   3B1.3.\n\n          Finally, the court granted a two-level reduction in\n\ndefendant's    offense   level   for    his   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility, but it rejected the government's motion for a\n\ndownward  departure  based  upon  defendant's  assistance  to\n\ngovernment authorities.  This  left defendant with an offense\n\nlevel of twenty-five.   Given a criminal history of  one, the\n\nsentence range was from  fifty-seven to seventy-one months of\n\nimprisonment  with a  possible fine  ranging from  $10,000 to\n\n$100,000, plus a  term of supervised release  of three years.\n\nDefendant was sentenced  to concurrent  terms of  fifty-seven\n\nmonths imprisonment, the lowest possible under the applicable\n\nguideline  range, concurrent  three-year terms  of supervised\n\nrelease and  a special  monetary assessment of  fifty dollars\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nper count for a total of two hundred dollars, with no further\n\nfine.\n\n          On  appeal,  defendant  argues  that  his  sentence\n\nshould be vacated because 1) his acceptance of responsibility\n\nentitled  him to a three  point reduction, rather  than a two\n\npoint  reduction in  his BOL;  and 2)  his assistance  to the\n\ngovernment entitled him to a downward departure.1\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  Section 3E1.1:  The Downward Adjustment\n                                           \n\n          \"Whether   a   defendant   has  accepted   personal\n\nresponsibility is a `fact-dominated  issue.'\"  United  States\n                                                             \n\nv. Donovan,  996 F.2d  1343,  1346 (1st  Cir. 1993)  (quoting\n          \n\nUnited States v.  Royer, 895  F.2d 28, 29  (1st Cir.  1990)).\n                       \n\nThus,  a  decision  to  grant  a  two-point  reduction  under\n\nU.S.S.G.    3E1.1(a),  rather than  a  three-point  reduction\n\nunder  U.S.S.G.    3E1.1(b), \"will  not be  overturned unless\n\nclearly erroneous.\"  Id.\n                        \n\n                    \n\n1.  In addition, defendant argues  that the court  improperly\ndeparted upward  in arriving  at his 57-month  sentence.   In\nfact,  no  upward  departure  occurred.   Rather,  the  court\napplied  several adjustments  which  raised defendant's  BOL.\nAll upward adjustments are fully supported by  the record and\nby the district court's findings of fact.\n          Defendant  also  argues  that  the  district  court\nfailed to  properly explain  its reasons  for the  degree and\ndirection of its departure.  We see no merit to  this line of\nargument, both  because no departure took  place, and because\nthe  district  court  fully  explained  all  aspects  of  the\nsentence.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Using this lens of  review we find no  error, clear\n\nor  otherwise.   Because defendant's  decision to  change his\n\nplea  did not occur until the day before trial, defendant did\n\nnot satisfy section 3E1.1(b)'s requirement that a plea permit\n\nthe  government  to  avoid  preparing for  trial.    Although\n\ndefendant may have contemplated a change of plea at some time\n\nearlier than the  actual change,  it appeared up  to the  day\n\nbefore  trial that  defendant and  his two  codefendants were\n\ngoing  to stand  trial  in a  lengthy  and complicated  case.\n\nThus,  it was not error  for the court  to determine that the\n\ngovernment  was not spared  the task of  preparing for trial,\n\nand that therefore the strictures of section 3E1.1(b) had not\n\nbeen met.  \n\nB.  Section 5K1.1:  The Downward Departure\n                                          \n\n          The second arrow in defendant's quiver is his claim\n\nthat  he is  entitled to  a downward  departure based  on his\n\nassistance to the government.\n\n          Where, as  here, the government has  filed a motion\n\nrequesting  a downward  departure  under  U.S.S.G.     5K1.1,\n\n\"weighing  the relevant factors in order to decide whether to\n\ndepart (and if so, by how much) is something best done by the\n\nsentencing court.\"  United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d  1150,\n                                            \n\n1157  (1st  Cir.  1993).   We  review  the  district  court's\n\ndetermination for abuse of discretion only.  Id.  \n                                                \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          The district court found that  the circumstances in\n\nthis case  did not warrant such  a departure.   In arguing to\n\nthe contrary,  defendant states that  the government breached\n\nits  plea   agreement  by   failing   to  disclose   complete\n\ninformation   concerning   his   assistance   to   government\n\nauthorities.   As a preliminary  matter, the record  does not\n\nsupport  such   a  conclusion.    The   transcript  from  the\n\nsentencing  proceeding shows  that the  government repeatedly\n\nurged the court to depart downward and does not at all reveal\n\na  withholding  of information.   Thus,  as a  purely factual\n\nmatter, we see no merit in defendant's claim to the contrary.\n\n               More   importantly,  we   find  no   abuse  of\n\ndiscretion  in  the   district  court's  determination   that\n\ndefendant is  not entitled  to a  downward departure  for his\n\nassistance  to  authorities.    Both  below  and  on  appeal,\n\ndefendant merely recites the fact that, subsequent to his own\n\nguilty  plea, two codefendants  also pleaded guilty.   At the\n\nsentencing   hearing,   the   district   court   scrupulously\n\nquestioned  a  government  investigator  on  the  subject  of\n\ndefendant's assistance to government authorities  and learned\n\nthat defendant's plea  was of virtually no  assistance to the\n\ngovernment  in  its   ongoing  case  against   codefendants.2\n\n                    \n\n2.  For example, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n          The Court:  Would it be fair to say that\n                      when  you interviewed  [defendant after\nhis\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nAccordingly, we find no  abuse of discretion in  the district\n\ncourt's   determination  that   no  downward   departure  for\n\nassistance to government authorities was warranted.     \n\n                    \n\n                      guilty plea], you already had 99.9\n                      percent of this case [against \n                      codefendants] made?\n          Witness:    Yes, the case was completed.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed  by\n\nthe district court is \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n",

At the sentencing hearing, the district court scrupulously questioned a government investigator on the subject of defendant's assistance to government authorities and learned that defendant's plea was of virtually no assistance to the government in its ongoing case against codefendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's determination that no downward departure for assistance to government authorities was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed by the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition, defendant argues that the court improperly departed upward in arriving at his 57-month sentence.

Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>(I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS(</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant established business colleges at different locations and fraudulently obtained federal education funds, mostly Pell Grants.  He then used these funds for his own private, non-educational purposes.  Through the scheme, defendant improperly obtained more than $2,500,000.  A fifteen- count indictment charged him with a variety of offenses involving the manipulation of federal funds.  On the day before trial, he pleaded guilty to four of the counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the plea agreement, the government agreed to consider filing a motion for downward departure depending on the degree of defendant's assistance to government authorities.  Prior to the day of sentencing, the government filed such a motion pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\") Sec. 5K1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the offenses covered by the four counts to which defendant pleaded, he began with a base offense level (BOL) of six, pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(a).  Because the fraudulent scheme resulted in losses to the government in excess of $2,500,000, a thirteen-level upward adjustment was made to the BOL pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1)(N).  In addition, a further two-level upward adjustment was made for more than minimal planning under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2)(A);  a four-level upward adjustment was added based on appellant's role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a);  and a two- level upward adjustment was added for abuse of a position of trust under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court granted a two-level reduction in defendant's offense level for his acceptance of responsibility, but it rejected the government's motion for a downward departure based upon defendant's assistance to government authorities.  This left defendant with an offense level of twenty-five.  Given a criminal history of one, the sentence range was from fifty-seven to seventy-one months of imprisonment with a possible fine ranging from $10,000 to $100,000, plus a term of supervised release of three years.  Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of fifty-seven months imprisonment, the lowest possible under the applicable guideline range, concurrent three-year terms of supervised release and a special monetary assessment of fifty dollars per count for a total of two hundred dollars, with no further fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendant argues that his sentence should be vacated because 1) his acceptance of responsibility entitled him to a three point reduction, rather than a two point reduction in his BOL;  and 2) his assistance to the government entitled him to a downward departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Section 3E1.1:  The Downward Adjustment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Whether a defendant has accepted personal responsibility is a 'fact-dominated issue.' \"  United States v.  Donovan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610557\"><a href=\"/opinion/610557/united-states-v-richard-j-donovan/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1343</span></a></span>, 1346 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting  United States v. Royer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536029\"><a href=\"/opinion/536029/united-states-v-marc-a-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir. 1990)).  Thus, a decision to grant a two-point reduction under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a), rather than a three-point reduction under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(b), \"will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using this lens of review we find no error, clear or otherwise.  Because defendant's decision to change his plea did not occur until the day before trial, defendant did not satisfy section 3E1.1(b)'s requirement that a plea permit the government to avoid preparing for trial.  Although defendant may have contemplated a change of plea at some time earlier than the actual change, it appeared up to the day before trial that defendant and his two codefendants were going to stand trial in a lengthy and complicated case.  Thus, it was not error for the court to determine that the government was not spared the task of preparing for trial, and that therefore the strictures of section 3E1.1(b) had not been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Section 5K1.1:  The Downward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second arrow in defendant's quiver is his claim that he is entitled to a downward departure based on his assistance to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the government has filed a motion requesting a downward departure under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1, \"weighing the relevant factors in order to decide whether to depart (and if so, by how much) is something best done by the sentencing court.\"   United States v. Mariano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598971\"><a href=\"/opinion/598971/united-states-v-abel-a-mariano-jr-united-states-of-america-v-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span>, 1157 (1st Cir. 1993).  We review the district court's determination for abuse of discretion only.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the circumstances in this case did not warrant such a departure.  In arguing to the contrary, defendant states that the government breached its plea agreement by failing to disclose complete information concerning his assistance to government authorities.  As a preliminary matter, the record does not support such a conclusion.  The transcript from the sentencing proceeding shows that the government repeatedly urged the court to depart downward and does not at all reveal a withholding of information.  Thus, as a purely factual matter, we see no merit in defendant's claim to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's determination that defendant is not entitled to a downward departure for his assistance to authorities.  Both below and on appeal, defendant merely recites the fact that, subsequent to his own guilty plea, two codefendants also pleaded guilty.  At the sentencing hearing, the district court scrupulously questioned a government investigator on the subject of defendant's assistance to government authorities and learned that defendant's plea was of virtually no assistance to the government in its ongoing case against codefendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's determination that no downward departure for assistance to government authorities was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed by the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition, defendant argues that the court improperly departed upward in arriving at his 57-month sentence.
