Pro se appellant Joseph Galibois appeals the\n\ndismissal of his civil rights action by the United States District\n\nCourt   for   the    District    of     New    Hampshire.      According      to   his\n\ncomplaint, Galibois's constitutional rights to free expression, due\n\nprocess, and equal protection were violated on the day of the last\n\npresidential       election    when     police    in    Nashua,    New    Hampshire,\n\ninterfered with Galibois's campaign demonstration against candidate\n\nJohn Kerry.        The court dismissed the suit as barred by the so-\n\ncalled Rooker-Feldman doctrine.               See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co.,\n\n263 U.S. 413 (1923); District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.\n\nFeldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983).            We vacate the dismissal and remand\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n     Two days after the alleged campaign incident, Galibois filed\n\na civil rights suit in New Hampshire Superior Court.                     The case was\n\ndismissed for failure to state a claim.                   No leave to amend was\n\ngranted and Galibois did not seek to appeal the judgment. Instead,\n\nhe abandoned his state court case and filed a new, similar action\n\nin federal court on November 24, 2004.                    The federal case was\n\ndismissed on February 15, 2005.               Galibois now appeals.\n\n     Citing Badillo-Santiago v. Naveira-Merly, 378 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (\"Rooker-Feldman applies to state or territorial court\n\njudgments     to    which     federal     courts       would   accord     preclusive\n\neffect.\"),    the    lower    court     first     determined      that,    under   New\n\nHampshire law, the state court judgment had preclusive effect\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fbecause Galibois never sought leave to amend the complaint.           Since\n\nGalibois's   federal   claims   arose    \"from    the   same   incident   and\n\ninvolve[d] the same factual scenario as the claim he alleged in the\n\nstate court petition,\" the court concluded that Galibois, in\n\nessence, was seeking federal review of the state decision. Such\n\nreview being beyond the jurisdiction of a federal district court,\n\nthe court dismissed the case.\n\n     Subsequent to the district court judgment, the Supreme Court\n\nissued an opinion that \"substantially altered [the] understanding\n\nof the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.\"        Federacion de Maestros de Puerto\n\nRico v. Junta de Relaciones del Trabajo de Puerto Rico, 410 F.3d\n\n17, 19 (1st Cir. 2005).         In Exxon-Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\n\nIndustries Corp., 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521 (2005), the Court made clear\n\nthat Rooker-Feldman had \"sometimes been construed to extend far\n\nbeyond [its original] contours\" to the point that it threatened to\n\nsupersede ordinary rules of preclusion.          Such an expansive reading\n\nwas contrary to the congressional mandate, under the Full Faith and\n\nCredit Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, that state law, not a uniform federal\n\nrule, should govern the preclusive effect of state court judgments.\n\nLance v. Dennis, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 1202 (2006). Consequently, the\n\nRooker-Feldman rule, henceforth, should be \"confined to cases of\n\nthe kind from which the doctrine acquired its name.\" Specifically,\n\nthe doctrine applies only to \"limited circumstances\" where \"the\n\nlosing party in state court filed suit in federal court after the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fstate proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused by the\n\nstate-court judgment and seeking review and rejection of that\n\njudgment.\"     Id. at 1526.    On the other hand, \"[i]f a federal\n\nplaintiff 'present[s] some independent claim, albeit one that\n\ndenies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case\n\nto which he was a party . . . then there is jurisdiction and state\n\nlaw determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of\n\npreclusion.'\"    Id. at 1527 (quoting GASH Assocs. v. Village of\n\nRosemont, 995 F.2d 726, 728 (7th Cir. 1993));1           Lance, 126 S.Ct.\n\nat 1202 (\"Rooker-Feldman is not simply preclusion by another\n\nname\").     In other words, Exxon requires this court to examine\n\nwhether the state court loser who files suit in federal court seeks\n\nredress for an injury caused by the state court decision itself or\n\nfor an injury cause by the defendant.           \"If a federal plaintiff\n\nasserts as a legal wrong an allegedly erroneous decision by a state\n\ncourt, and seeks relief from a state court judgment based on that\n\ndecision,    Rooker-Feldman   bars    subject   matter   jurisdiction   in\n\nfederal district court. If, on the other hand, a federal plaintiff\n\nasserts as a legal wrong an allegedly illegal act or omission by an\n\n\n\n     1\n      The language quoted above is technically dictum, since Exxon\ndealt with parallel state and federal proceedings. However, since\n\"the Supreme Court went beyond the facts of the case to give clear\ninstructions to the circuits on how to address additional factual\nsituations . . . , [failure to heed this language] would be to\nignore these unambiguous directives from the Supreme Court.\" Todd\nv. Weltman, Weinberg & Reis, Co., 434 F.3d 432, 437 (6th Cir.\n2006).\n\n                                     -4-\n\fadverse party, Rooker-Feldman does not bar jurisdiction.\" Noel v.\n\nHall, 341 F.3d 1148, 1164 (9th Cir. 2003)2; see Washington v.\n\nWillmore, 407 F.3d 274, 280 (4th Cir. 2005) (holding, post Exxon,\n\nthat       the     Rooker-Feldman         doctrine        does   not     apply    because\n\n\"[plaintiff's]          claim      of   injury    rests    not   on    the   state   court\n\njudgment         itself,     but   rather   on     the    alleged     violation    of   his\n\nconstitutional          rights      [by   the    defendant]\");        Todd   v.   Weltman,\n\nWeinberg & Reis, Co., 434 F.3d 432, 437 (6th Cir. 2006); Jensen v.\n\nFoley, 295 F.3d 745, 747-48 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"The Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine, generally speaking, bars a plaintiff from bringing a §\n\n1983 suit to remedy an injury inflicted by the state court's\n\ndecision . . . Preclusion, on the other hand, applies when a\n\nfederal plaintiff complains of an injury that was not caused by the\n\nstate court, but which the state court has previously failed to\n\nrectify.\") (emphasis in original).\n\n       In the instant case, Galibois sought relief not from an injury\n\nallegedly caused by the state court but from an injury allegedly\n\ninflicted         by   the   defendant.          That    his   federal   claim    alleged\n\ninjuries similar to those that he raised or could have raised in\n\nhis state claim, while arguably relevant to preclusion analysis,\n\n\n\n       2\n      The Seventh Circuit has suggested the following as a \"rough\nguide\" for determining whether the Rooker-Feldman doctrine applied:\n\"if the federal plaintiff was the plaintiff in state court, apply\nres judicata; if the federal plaintiff was the defendant in state\ncourt, apply Rooker-Feldman.\" Garry v. Geils, 82 F.3d 1362, 1366-67\n(7th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                             -5-\n\fdoes not bring Rooker-Feldman into play.     See Noel, 341 F.3d at\n\n1165 (explaining that it was \"error\" for the lower court to\n\nconclude that \"because [the same claims] could have been raised in\n\nthe parties' [state] litigation, or were already specifically\n\naddressed in that litigation, the federal claims are barred under\n\nRooker-Feldman\").\n\n      Turning, then, to the issue of preclusion, we must, pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1738, \"give the same preclusive effect to state\n\ncourt judgments that those judgments would be given in the courts\n\nof the State from which the judgments emerged.\" Kremer v. Chemical\n\nConstr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 466 (1982).   Under New Hampshire law,\n\na dismissal for failure to state a claim has preclusive effect only\n\nif the plaintiff is given leave to amend.     See, e.g., Cambridge\n\nMutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Crete, 846 A.2d 521, 526 (N.H. 2004).   To\n\nassure that this requirement has \"practical meaning, . . the trial\n\ncourt must allow the plaintiff opportunity to amend the writ before\n\ndismissing for failure to state a claim, allowing the plaintiff two\n\nchances to state a case before precluding the plaintiff from\n\nburdening the courts and opposing parties with further attempts.\"\n\nId.   Although leave to amend may be implicit, Warren v. Town of\n\nEast Kingston, 761 A.2d 465, 468 (N.H. 2000), Galibois's assertion\n\nthat the Superior Court gave no implicit, much less explicit, leave\n\nto amend is uncontested at this point. Furthermore, once the court\n\ndismissed the case and rendered final judgment, the court was\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fwithout authority to grant leave to amend even if Galibois had so\n\nrequested.   Arsenault v. Scanlon, 660 A.2d 1110, 1111-12 (N.H.\n\n1995).   In these circumstances, we cannot say that Galibois was\n\ngiven a \"meaningful\" opportunity to amend his complaint.    Thus,\n\nunder New Hampshire law, he presumably had the right to refile his\n\nclaim in state court within one year of the judgment, N.H. Rev.\n\nStat. § 508:10; Moulton-Garland v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 736 A.2d\n\n1219, 1220-21 (N.H. 1999).     On this record, then, he is not\n\nprecluded from bringing a similar suit in federal court.\n\n     We need go no further.    The dismissal of the complaint is\n\nvacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.   Costs\n\nare to be taxed in favor of the appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

Under New Hampshire law,\n\na dismissal for failure to state a claim has preclusive effect only\n\nif the plaintiff is given leave to amend.     See, e.g., Cambridge\n\nMutual Fire Ins. Co. v.

To\n\nassure that this requirement has \"practical meaning, . . the trial\n\ncourt must allow the plaintiff opportunity to amend the writ before\n\ndismissing for failure to state a claim, allowing the plaintiff two\n\nchances to state a case before precluding the plaintiff from\n\nburdening the courts and opposing parties with further attempts.\"\n\nId.

Furthermore, once the court\n\ndismissed the case and rendered final judgment, the court was\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fwithout authority to grant leave to amend even if Galibois had so\n\nrequested.

In these circumstances, we cannot say that Galibois was\n\ngiven a \"meaningful\" opportunity to amend his complaint.    Thus,\n\nunder New Hampshire law, he presumably had the right to refile his\n\nclaim in state court within one year of the judgment, N.H. Rev.\n\nStat. § 508:10; Moulton-Garland v.

On this record, then, he is not\n\nprecluded from bringing a similar suit in federal court.\n\n     We need go no further.    The dismissal of the complaint is\n\nvacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
