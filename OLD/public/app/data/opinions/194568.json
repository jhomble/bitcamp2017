Appellants seek relief from\n                                  \n\nthe district court's dismissal of their challenge to the Medicaid\n\nPart  B reimbursement process.   We  do not  reach the  merits of\n\nappellant's claims, because we lack appellate jurisdiction. \n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          As  the facts relevant to  the merits of  this case are\n\nset forth  fully in the district court opinion,1 we do not repeat\n\nthem here.   We will  recount only  those facts pertinent  to the\n\nissue of appellate jurisdiction.  \n\n          Robert  Griffith commenced  this  case  with  Katherine\n\nNadworny \"for  themselves  and all  others  similarly  situated.\"\n\nPlaintiffs  claimed that  they were  denied coverage  for durable\n\nmedical equipment under Medicare Part B in violation of statutory\n\nand  constitutional law.2   The  complaint  indicated plaintiffs'\n\nintent to seek class certification.  \n\n          Before  the district  court  certified  the class,  the\n\nDepartment  of Health and  Human Services (\"HHS\")  sent checks to\n\nGriffith and Nadworny for the amount they would have received had\n\ntheir Medicare Part B claims been granted.\n\n          The   district   court   later   certified   a   class,\n\nsubstituting   June   Burns   and   Amelio   Bianchi   as   class\n\n                    \n\n1  Reported at 789 F. Supp. 478 (D. Mass. 1992).\n\n2  Plaintiffs claimed violations of the Medicare Act, Pub. L. No.\n89-97,  79 Stat 286 (codified as amended in scattered sections of\n42  U.S.C.,  principally     1935  et  seq.), the  Administrative\n                                           \nProcedures Act,  5 U.S.C.     551  et seq., 701  et seq.,  3105 &amp;\n                                                        \n3344,   and  the  Due   Process  Clause  of   the  United  States\nConstitution.  \n\n                               -3-\n\nrepresentatives.     Robert   Griffith  and   Katherine  Nadworny\n\ncontinued to sue individually.  The district court found no merit\n\nin the substance of plaintiffs' claims, and this appeal followed.\n\n          The  notice of appeal in  this case was  filed with the\n\nstyle of \"Robert  Griffith, et  al., plaintiffs.\"   It stated  in\n\nrelevant part  \"Robert Griffith, et al.,  plaintiffs named above,\n\nhereby appeal . . . .\"\n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n          Fed.  R.  App. P.  3(c)  plainly  requires that  \"[t]he\n\nnotice  of appeal shall specify  the party or  parties taking the\n\nappeal.\"     The   rule  is   a  jurisdictional   threshold;  its\n\nrequirements must be met before we can exercise jurisdiction over\n\nan appeal.  Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 314-15\n                                           \n\n(1988).  Thus, the \"failure to name a party in a notice of appeal\n\n. . .  constitutes a failure  of that party  to appeal.\"   Id. at\n                                                              \n\n314.   The  rule ensures  that both  the appellee  and the  court\n\nreceive  notice of the identity  of the appellants,  and that the\n\nappellee and the court are advised  as to exactly who is bound by\n\nan adverse judgment and who is not.  Id. at 318.  \n                                        \n\n          Appellant argues  that the  \"Robert  Griffith, et  al.\"\n\ndesignation sufficed  to properly name  the certified class  as a\n\nparty to the appeal.  We disagree.  \"Et al.\" does not provide the\n\nnecessary  specificity for us,  or appellee, to  know who besides\n\nRobert Griffith is a party.  As the Supreme Court stated, \"use of\n\nthe phrase 'et al.,' which literally  means 'and others,' utterly\n\nfails  to provide such notice to either intended recipient.\"  Id.\n                                                                 \n\n                               -4-\n\nThe  fact that a class has been  certified does not make \"et al.\"\n\nsuddenly effective.   Hammon v.  Kelly, 980 F.2d  785, 786  (D.C.\n                                      \n\nCir. 1992);  Ooley v. Schwitzer  Div., Household  Mfg., Inc.  961\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1293,  1305-06 (7th  Cir.), cert.  denied, 61 U.S.L.W.  3261\n                                              \n\n(1992).  \n\n          The decisions  in Rendon v.

Estate of\n                                                                 \n\nRockefeller,  885  F.2d 1060,  1061  n.1  (2d  Cir. 1989),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied,  Mancusi  v. Al-Jundi,  112 S.  Ct.  182 (1991),  are not\n                             \n\ncontrary to  our result.   In those  cases, the courts  held that\n\nwhen  the class representative was named in the notice of appeal,\n\nwith the  designation \"et al.\"  following, the  entire class  had\n\nappealed properly.    In  the present  case,  however,  even  the\n\nminimal requirement imposed by the Fifth and  Second Circuits was\n\nnot met:  the class representative was not named.  As neither the\n\nclass nor any  other potential  appellant was named  as a  proper\n\nparty to this appeal, we have no jurisdiction over their claims.\n\n          For  the  purpose  of  informing  future  class  action\n\nappellants exactly  what this court expects the  notice of appeal\n\nto  contain, we  adopt  the requirement  imposed  by the  Seventh\n\nCircuit and the  D.C. Circuit.  As  the D.C. Circuit  framed this\n\nrequirement, \"the notice  of appeal  should state the  name of  a\n\nproper class representative along with some general invocation of\n\nhis representative capacity,  such as  'John Smith,  individually\n\nand on behalf of  all other persons similarly situated'  or 'John\n\nSmith, as class representative.'\"  Hammon, 980 F.2d at 786.\n                                         \n\n                               -5-\n\n          The only  remaining plaintiff  is Robert Griffith.   We\n\nmust  dismiss his appeal as  moot because, as  the district court\n\nnoted, he has already  received everything that he claims  he was\n\nentitled  to  recover.   Wilson v.  Secretary  of Health  &amp; Human\n                                                                 \n\nServices, 671 F.2d 673, 679 (1st Cir. 1982).\n        \n\n          Appeal dismissed.\n                          \n\n                               -6-\n",

Id. at 318.  \n                                        \n\n          Appellant argues  that the  \"Robert  Griffith, et  al.\"\n\ndesignation sufficed  to properly name  the certified class  as a\n\nparty to the appeal.  We disagree.  \"Et al.\" does not provide the\n\nnecessary  specificity for us,  or appellee, to  know who besides\n\nRobert Griffith is a party.  As the Supreme Court stated, \"use of\n\nthe phrase 'et al.,' which literally  means 'and others,' utterly\n\nfails  to provide such notice to either intended recipient.\"  Id.\n                                                                 \n\n                               -4-\n\nThe  fact that a class has been  certified does not make \"et al.\"\n\nsuddenly effective.

In those  cases, the courts  held that\n\nwhen  the class representative was named in the notice of appeal,\n\nwith the  designation \"et al.\"  following, the  entire class  had\n\nappealed properly.    In  the present  case,  however,  even  the\n\nminimal requirement imposed by the Fifth and  Second Circuits was\n\nnot met:  the class representative was not named.  As neither the\n\nclass nor any  other potential  appellant was named  as a  proper\n\nparty to this appeal, we have no jurisdiction over their claims.\n\n          For  the  purpose  of  informing  future  class  action\n\nappellants exactly  what this court expects the  notice of appeal\n\nto  contain, we  adopt  the requirement  imposed  by the  Seventh\n\nCircuit and the  D.C. Circuit.  As  the D.C. Circuit  framed this\n\nrequirement, \"the notice  of appeal  should state the  name of  a\n\nproper class representative along with some general invocation of\n\nhis representative capacity,  such as  'John Smith,  individually\n\nand on behalf of  all other persons similarly situated'  or 'John\n\nSmith, as class representative.'\"  Hammon, 980 F.2d at 786.\n                                         \n\n                               -5-\n\n          The only  remaining plaintiff  is Robert Griffith.   We\n\nmust  dismiss his appeal as  moot because, as  the district court\n\nnoted, he has already  received everything that he claims  he was\n\nentitled  to  recover.   Wilson v.
