Appellant        Neliza    Figueroa-\n\nCartagena (\"Neliza\") was found guilty of aiding and abetting a\n\ncarjacking that resulted in death, 18 U.S.C. § 2119(3); conspiring\n\nto   commit    that    carjacking,   18    U.S.C.    §§ 371;    and     aiding   and\n\nabetting the carriage or use of a firearm during the carjacking, 18\n\nU.S.C.    § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii).        She    and     two   co-defendants,     Félix\n\nGabriel Castro-Davis (\"Gabriel\") and Félix Alberto Castro-Davis\n\n(\"Alberto\"), appealed their convictions on a number of grounds,\n\nincluding sufficiency of the evidence.              In a separate opinion, we\n\naffirmed the convictions of Alberto and Gabriel. See United States\n\nv. Castro-Davis, Nos. 08-2108, 08-2109. In this opinion, we affirm\n\nNeliza's carjacking and conspiracy convictions and reverse her\n\nfirearm conviction.1\n\n                                      I.\n\n              The underlying facts are set forth in detail in the\n\ncompanion opinion, United States v. Castro-Davis, Nos. 08-2108, 08-\n\n2109.     As we explained there, the jury could have found from the\n\nevidence presented at trial that Gabriel and Alberto carjacked\n\nHéctor Pérez-Torres on the afternoon of July 15, 2006 in Caguas,\n\nPuerto Rico.          There was no evidence presented regarding what\n\n\n\n      1\n          Judge Torruella dissents from the affirmance of the\ncarjacking and conspiracy convictions. Also, in a section of this\nopinion not joined by Judge Baldock (Part II.C), I explain my\nreservations about the precedents that require, in my view,\naffirming the carjacking conviction, and urge en banc review to re-\nexamine them.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fhappened in the immediate aftermath of the carjacking.            Later that\n\nevening, Gabriel and Alberto arrived at Neliza's parents' house in\n\nCayey with Pérez handcuffed inside his own car.            Gabriel had been\n\nliving at the house with Neliza, whom he was dating at the time.\n\nAlthough Neliza did not arrive with Gabriel and Alberto, she placed\n\na phone call at that time to her brother José, who was inside the\n\nhouse, and asked him to step outside to speak with Gabriel.              When\n\nJosé went outside, Gabriel offered him money to guard Pérez for a\n\nwhile. José agreed, and Gabriel and Alberto left to withdraw money\n\nusing Pérez's ATM card.\n\n           While   watching    Pérez,     José   grew   nervous   and   called\n\nGabriel to urge him to hurry.             Neliza answered the phone and\n\nassured him they were nearby.2      Just after the conversation ended,\n\nhowever, Pérez jumped from the car and attempted to escape.              José\n\nunsuccessfully tried to force him back into the car, and a struggle\n\nensued until Gabriel, Alberto, and Neliza arrived and subdued\n\nPérez.   In the meantime, several neighbors approached the house to\n\ninquire about the noise.      Neliza told them not to get involved, and\n\nshe and Gabriel closed a gate to prevent them from approaching.\n\n           José went to a gas station after the fight to wash his\n\ncar and drink a beer.      Gabriel, Alberto, and Neliza followed to\n\ncheck on him.   Neliza was driving her own car, Gabriel was driving\n\n\n\n     2\n          It is unclear whether Neliza answered Gabriel's phone or\nwhether José accidentally called his sister's phone.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fPérez's car, and Alberto was sitting in Pérez's car holding Pérez\n\nin a headlock.      The three spoke briefly with José and then drove\n\noff in the same direction.\n\n           The next day, Neliza and Gabriel met José at the house.\n\nGabriel explained that he and Alberto had killed Pérez the night\n\nbefore by asphyxiating him with duct tape.3           Gabriel and Neliza\n\ninstructed José to threaten the neighbors and tell them to remain\n\nsilent about the previous day's events.\n\n           The following year, Gabriel, Alberto, and Neliza were\n\ncharged with aiding and abetting a carjacking that resulted in\n\ndeath, 18 U.S.C. § 2119(3); conspiring to commit that carjacking,\n\n18 U.S.C. §§ 371; and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm\n\nduring the carjacking, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). After a four-\n\nday trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.\n\nThe district court sentenced Neliza to a total term of imprisonment\n\nof   262   months   and   sentenced   Gabriel   and    Alberto   to   life\n\nimprisonment.    This appeal followed.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           On appeal, Neliza challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence supporting her convictions and claims that the district\n\ncourt made a number of evidentiary and procedural errors that\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          The government has not alleged that Neliza was directly\ninvolved in the killing of Pérez.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fentitle her to a new trial.              We address each of her arguments in\n\nturn, beginning with the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\n              We review de novo the district court's denial of Neliza's\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal.               United States v. Thompson, 449\n\nF.3d 267, 275 (1st Cir. 2006).            Our inquiry is whether, taking the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a reasonable\n\nfactfinder could have found her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nId.\n\nA.    Carjacking\n\n              Neliza's challenge to her carjacking conviction focuses\n\non    what    we   have   called   the    \"temporal   limits\"   of   the   crime.\n\nRamírez-Burgos v. United States, 313 F.3d 23, 30 n.9 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).       She claims that her involvement, if any, with Alberto and\n\nGabriel's criminal scheme began long after those two had seized\n\nPérez's car.        In her view, there was no basis for the jury to\n\nconclude that she aided and abetted the carjacking because it is\n\nnot possible to aid and abet a crime that has already been\n\ncommitted.4\n\n              The basic legal premise of her argument -- that she\n\ncannot be convicted of aiding and abetting a completed crime -- is\n\nsound.       At common law, participants in a felony were divided into\n\n\n\n       4\n          Neliza also suggests in passing that she did not have the\nrequisite intent to commit the carjacking. She has not made any\nattempt to develop that argument, however, and we therefore deem it\nwaived. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                          -5-\n\ffour    categories       according   to   the    nature      and    timing   of     their\n\nparticipation: \"(1) first-degree principals, those who actually\n\ncommitted the crime in question; (2) second-degree principals,\n\naiders    and     abettors      present    at     the     scene     of    the     crime;\n\n(3) accessories before the fact, aiders and abettors who helped the\n\nprincipal       before    the   basic     criminal      event      took    place;    and\n\n(4) accessories after the fact, persons who helped the principal\n\nafter    the    basic     criminal    event      took    place.\"          Gonzales    v.\n\nDuenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 189 (2007).                    The enactment of the\n\nfederal    aiding    and     abetting     statute       in   1909    eliminated      the\n\ndistinctions among the first three categories.                      The statute now\n\nprovides that any such participant \"is punishable as a principal.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2(a); Standefer v. United States, 447 U.S. 10, 19\n\n(1980).    However, Congress chose to retain the fourth category --\n\naccessory after the fact -- as a separate class whose \"offense is\n\ndistinct and is differently punished.\"                       Bollenbach v. United\n\nStates, 326 U.S. 607, 611 (1946).               Accessories after the fact may\n\ngenerally be imprisoned \"not more than one-half the maximum term of\n\nimprisonment . . . prescribed for the punishment of the principal.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3.\n\n               The temporal boundary between principals and aiders and\n\nabettors, on the one hand, and accessories after the fact, on the\n\nother hand, thus remains important in federal criminal law.                           On\n\neach side of that boundary lies a separate offense with separate\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\felements and a separate punishment.              United States v. Avants, 367\n\nF.3d 433, 450 (5th Cir. 2004).               One consequence of that enduring\n\ndistinction is that \"a person cannot be found guilty of aiding and\n\nabetting a crime that already has been committed.\"                 United States\n\nv. Hamilton, 334 F.3d 170, 180 (2d Cir. 2003); SEC v. Papa, 555\n\nF.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n               This   point    has   important      implications   for     Neliza's\n\nliability.       To fully understand those implications, we must draw a\n\ncareful distinction between the \"offense\" of carjacking and the\n\noffense conduct.         Like many crimes, carjacking is composed of\n\nseveral different types of elements: the offense conduct (the\n\ntaking of a motor vehicle from the person or presence of another by\n\nforce and violence or by intimidation), a mental state (the intent\n\nto cause death or serious bodily harm), an attendant circumstance\n\n(the       transportation     of   the    vehicle   in   interstate   or    foreign\n\ncommerce), and, for aggravated carjacking, a consequence (serious\n\nbodily injury or death).5                For purposes of aiding and abetting\n\nliability, it is the duration of the offense conduct that matters,\n\nsince the aiding and abetting statute \"states a rule of criminal\n\nresponsibility for acts which one assists another in performing.\"\n\nNye & Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 620 (1949) (emphasis\n\n\n       5\n          See 1 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 6.1 (2d\ned.   2003)    (distinguishing    between   \"acts,\"    \"surrounding\ncircumstances,\" and \"consequences\"); Model Penal Code § 1.13(9)\n(2001) (dividing \"element[s] of an offense\" into three categories:\n\"conduct,\" \"attendant circumstances,\" and \"result[s] of conduct\").\n\n                                           -7-\n\fadded); see also United States v. Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d 849,\n\n853 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"[A]iding and abetting is a form of agency in\n\nwhich the law holds a defendant criminally responsible for the acts\n\nand conduct of another person even though the defendant may not\n\nhave       personally   committed   every   act   constituting   the   offense\n\nalleged.\").6       In Neliza's case, if there is no evidence that she\n\naided Gabriel and Alberto in their performance of the offense\n\nconduct (either before the fact or during the fact), her conviction\n\ncannot stand.       Cf. United States v. Delpit, 94 F.3d 1134, 1150-51\n\n(8th Cir. 1996).\n\n               The factual premise of Neliza's argument -- that she did\n\nnot become involved until after Gabriel and Alberto seized the\n\ncar -- is also sound.         The first sign of Neliza's involvement in\n\nthe criminal episode was a phone call she made to her brother José\n\non the evening of July 15, 2006, asking him to step outside the\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          Although the current aiding and abetting statute obscures\nthis point by speaking in terms of aiding the commission of an\n\"offense,\" the focus on offense conduct was explicit in the former\nversion of the statute, which provided: \"Whoever directly commits\nany act constituting an offense defined in any law of the United\nStates, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures\nits commission, is a principal.\" 18 U.S.C. § 550 (1940) (emphasis\nadded). The current language was substituted as part of the 1948\nre-codification of Title 18.    It is apparent from the Revision\nNotes that the change was intended to be stylistic only. See 18\nU.S.C. § 2, Revision Notes (\"Section 2(a) comprises § 550 of Title\n18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., without change except in minor matters of\nphraseology.\").\n\n                                      -8-\n\fhouse to speak with Gabriel.7     But the seizure of the vehicle\n\noccurred several hours earlier, in the mid- to late-afternoon.\n\nThere was no evidence suggesting what Neliza might have been doing\n\nat the time of the seizure or when she became entangled in the\n\ncarjacking scheme.   The government attempted to fill this gap at\n\ntrial by arguing that \"somebody\" must have driven Alberto and\n\nGabriel from Cayey to the scene of the carjacking in Caguas: \"They\n\ndidn't walk from Cayey to Salchichón in Caguas. Somebody took them\n\nthere, and that someone is Neliza Figueroa-Cartagena.\"8     But the\n\ngovernment presented no evidence to support that theory.   Needless\n\nto say, Alberto and Gabriel could have arrived in Caguas in any\n\nnumber of ways, and they may have sought Neliza's aid after they\n\nseized the car.   The government's theory is pure conjecture, which\n\ncannot form the basis for a criminal conviction.9   United States v.\n\nSpinney, 65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          The precise time is a matter of dispute. José testified\nthat it was \"getting dark\" when Neliza called, which he estimated\nwas around 6:00 p.m. It was later pointed out that the sun sets\nsignificantly later than 6:00 p.m. during the summer in Puerto\nRico. The exact time is not critical for present purposes.\n     8\n          As we explain more fully in Part II.B, infra, this was\nnot the government's only factual argument about Neliza's\ninvolvement.\n     9\n          Indeed, the government has made little effort to defend\nthis theory on appeal, choosing instead to obscure the distinctions\namong the defendants by referring to them generically as\n\"appellants.\"\n\n                                -9-\n\f              It would seem to follow that Neliza's conviction cannot\n\nstand because there is insufficient evidence that she participated\n\nin the carjacking offense conduct.           But that conclusion rests on a\n\nthird, unstated assumption: that the offense conduct for carjacking\n\nbegins and ends when the vehicle is first seized.           In our circuit,\n\nat least, that is not the law.        We have held that when a carjacking\n\nvictim is taken hostage, \"the commission of [the] carjacking\n\ncontinues at least while the carjacker maintains control over the\n\nvictim and [his or] her car.\"         Ramírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d at 30 n.9;\n\naccord United States v. Lebrón-Cepeda, 324 F.3d 52, 61 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (per curiam); United States v. Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d 14,\n\n19   n.4      (1st    Cir.    2006)     (dictum);     United    States     v.\n\nMartinez-Bermudez, 387 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2004) (dictum).\n\n              That gloss on the carjacking statute casts Neliza's\n\nargument in a different light.         As we have said, an individual who\n\narrives on the scene after the offense conduct has ended cannot be\n\nheld liable as an aider and abettor.          But when the criminal conduct\n\nextends over a period of time, a latecomer \"may be convicted of\n\naiding and abetting even if [she] did not learn of the crime at its\n\ninception but knowingly assisted at a later stage.\"            United States\n\nv. Reifler, 446 F.3d 65, 96 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n              Neliza's participation fits within the latter category.\n\nUnder   our    precedent,    the   carjacking    offense   conduct   remained\n\nongoing while Pérez was a hostage in the car for many hours after\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fNeliza became involved.   During that time, Neliza lent significant\n\naid to Alberto and Gabriel: she allowed them to hold Pérez at her\n\nparents' house, she helped recruit her brother as a guard, and she\n\nwarded off curious neighbors.    She was not \"merely present\" at the\n\nscene of the crime; her aid was essential to the success of the\n\nscheme, and she may therefore be held liable as an aider and\n\nabettor.    United States v. Peña-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 28-29 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (affirming conviction where defendant aided and abetted\n\nhostage-taking by bringing meals to the hostage and letting him out\n\nto use the restroom); see also 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive\n\nCriminal Law § 13.2 (2d ed. 2003) (noting that an aider and abettor\n\nmay \"facilitate the crime by getting . . . [a] possible witness\n\naway from the scene\").\n\nB.   The Dissent\n\n            The dissent argues that it is a due process violation to\n\naffirm Neliza's conviction based on her conduct at the Figueroa\n\nhouse.     We respectfully disagree.   It is true that \"we cannot\n\naffirm a criminal conviction on the basis of a theory not presented\n\nto the jury . . . .\" Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 236\n\n(1980).     But that is not a problem here because the jury was\n\nspecifically invited to consider Neliza's conduct at the house.\n\nThe government argued in closing that Neliza should be convicted as\n\nan aider and abettor of the carjacking offense based in part on\n\nthat conduct, including her phone call to José and her intervention\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fwith   the     neighbors.     Neliza's    counsel   directly   engaged   the\n\ngovernment's argument in her own closing argument, questioning\n\nwhether José's account of Neliza's involvement at the house was\n\nreliable. Thus, the whole range of Neliza's conduct was put before\n\nthe jury.      It is of no moment that the government's case rested in\n\npart on an unsupported factual assertion (i.e., that Neliza drove\n\nAlberto and Gabriel to the site where they first seized Pérez's\n\nvehicle).       As the dissent acknowledges, we cannot overturn the\n\nverdict because it might have been based on a factually unsupported\n\ntheory.      See Santellan v. Cockrell, 271 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir.\n\n2001) (\"The Supreme Court has ruled that where a jury is given the\n\noption    of    choosing    between   factually   adequate   and   factually\n\ninadequate theories of guilt, jurors 'are well equipped to analyze\n\nthe evidence' and can be counted upon to base their verdict upon\n\nthe factually adequate theory.\" (quoting Griffin v. United States,\n\n502 U.S. 46, 59 (1991)).\n\n               Importantly,   neither    the   indictment    nor   the   jury\n\ninstructions limited this broad focus on the entirety of Neliza's\n\nconduct.       The indictment was framed in general terms that tracked\n\nthe language of the carjacking statute, and the jury instruction on\n\ncarjacking repeated that same language.             See 18 U.S.C. § 2119\n\n(\"Whoever, with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm\n\ntakes a motor vehicle that has been transported, shipped, or\n\nreceived in interstate or foreign commerce from the person or\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fpresence    of     another      by      force      and    violence       or      by\n\nintimidation . . . .\"). The instruction on aiding and abetting, in\n\nturn, was broadly worded and suggested that the entire course of\n\nNeliza's conduct could be considered.              For example, the jury was\n\ninstructed that \"[a] particular defendant, to be responsible under\n\naiding and abetting, need not perform the underlying criminal act,\n\nbe present when it was performed, or be aware of all the details of\n\nthe execution to be guilty of aiding and abetting.\" The government\n\nemphasized that point in its closing argument by listing all of\n\nNeliza's conduct and asserting: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, that is\n\ncalled aiding and abetting.       She didn't have to put the tape around\n\n[Pérez's] face.    She helped them.         She aided and abetted them.         She\n\nknew what they were doing.        She was standing to benefit from it,\n\nand she is just as responsible under the law as they are.\"\n\n           Under the circumstances, even in the absence of an\n\nexplicit   jury    instruction       that    the   offense     conduct   of     the\n\ncarjacking charge continued while Pérez was held hostage in the\n\ncar, the jury was presented with the theory that Neliza could be\n\nconvicted of carjacking based on her conduct at the house.                   Neliza\n\nhad ample opportunity to rebut the factual and legal basis for that\n\ntheory.    Ultimately,     however,     the     jury   chose   to    believe    the\n\ngovernment's     version   of   the   facts.       Affirming    on    that    basis\n\ntherefore does not infringe Neliza's \"right to be heard on the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fspecific charges of which [s]he is accused.\"       Dunn v. United\n\nStates, 442 U.S. 100, 106 (1979).10\n\nC.   Reconsidering the Abduction Rule11\n\n           Although I disagree with the dissent's argument that\n\nNeliza's carjacking conviction cannot be affirmed under our current\n\ncarjacking jurisprudence, I must acknowledge my reservations about\n\nthe correctness of that jurisprudence. The notion that the offense\n\nconduct for carjacking continues \"while the carjacker maintains\n\ncontrol over the victim and his or her car\" is essential to the\n\nholding that Neliza was properly convicted as an aider and abettor.\n\nThat construction of the carjacking statute, which I will refer to\n\nas the abduction rule, has been repeated in numerous cases in this\n\n\n\n      10\n          The dissent also raises the separate point that the\ngovernment has not fully developed on appeal the argument that\nNeliza's conviction can be affirmed based on her conduct at the\nhouse. We acknowledge that the government's briefing is rather\nunhelpful in that regard and that we could perhaps deem the\nargument to be abandoned or forfeited. See United States v. Vega\nMolina, 407 F.3d 511, 524 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Under the circumstances\nof this case, we choose not to do the government's homework.\").\nBut potential forfeitures arising out of poor appellate briefing\ncan be excused under appropriate circumstances. See Charles A.\nWright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure: Jurisdiction § 3974.1\n(4th ed. 2008). The government has invoked the relevant principles\nand cases, albeit in connection with the intent element rather than\nthe offense conduct element. We will not reverse what is otherwise\na valid conviction because the government has done a poor job of\nwriting its brief.\n      11\n          As already noted, Judge Baldock does not join me in this\nportion of the opinion.    Therefore, I must resort to the first\nperson in describing my views. However, as Judge Torruella makes\nclear in his separate opinion, he agrees with most of the analysis\nhere.\n\n                                -14-\n\fcircuit and finds support in several cases from other circuits.12\n\nNevertheless, the basis for that interpretation has never been\n\nexplained   and    does   not   appear   to   be    firmly   grounded   in   the\n\nstatutory text or the relevant case law.              Although the panel is\n\nbound to apply the abduction rule here, I believe the issue would\n\nbenefit from review by the full court.             I explain my view.\n\n            1.    Statutory Text -- \"Taking\"\n\n            Neliza's liability turns on whether Gabriel and Alberto's\n\noffense conduct continued as long as Pérez was held hostage or\n\nwhether it ended at an earlier point.              To determine whether (and\n\nhow long) offense conduct is capable of continuing, one must look\n\nat the \"the explicit language of the substantive criminal statute\"\n\nand the \"nature of the crime involved.\"            Toussie v. United States,\n\n397 U.S. 112, 115 (1970).         I address the statutory text in this\n\nsection, focusing on the meaning and duration of a \"taking.\"                 In\n\nthe following section, I consider the possibility that carjacking\n\nis by \"nature\" a crime that is capable of continuing after the\n\ntaking has ended.\n\n            The federal carjacking statute authorizes the punishment\n\nof any individual who,\n\n\n     12\n           See Ramírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d at 30 n.9; Lebrón-Cepeda,\n324   F.3d   at  61;   Matos-Quiñones,  456   F.3d  at  19   n.4;\nMartinez-Bermudez, 387 F.3d at 101; United States v. Cline, 362\nF.3d 343, 353 (6th Cir. 2004); United States v. Hicks, 103 F.3d\n837, 843 & nn. 4-5 (9th Cir. 1996), overruled on other grounds by\nUnited States v. W.R. Grace, 526 F.3d 499 (9th Cir. 2008) (en\nbanc).\n\n                                    -15-\n\f           with the intent to cause death or serious\n           bodily harm takes a motor vehicle that has\n           been transported, shipped, or received in\n           interstate or foreign commerce from the person\n           or presence of another by force and violence\n           or by intimidation, or attempts to do\n           so . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2119.   At the core of the crime of carjacking is the\n\nforcible \"taking\" of a motor vehicle \"from the person or presence\n\nof another.\"   \"Taking\" (or \"caption,\" as it was also called) is a\n\ncommon law term of art derived from the law of robbery and larceny.\n\nIt refers to the act of \"securing dominion\" over something.       3\n\nLaFave, supra, § 19.3(a); see also 3 Charles E. Torcia, Wharton's\n\nCriminal Law § 357 (15th ed. 2009) (\"There is a caption when the\n\ndefendant takes possession.   He takes possession when he exercises\n\ndominion and control over the property.\").    \"Taking\" was distinct\n\nfrom \"carrying away\" (or \"asportation\"), which was a separate\n\nelement and could not occur until after the property had been\n\n\"taken.\"   3 Torcia, supra, § 357.    Thus, at common law, a taking\n\nwas complete once the defendant had secured initial control over\n\nthe property in question.13\n\n\n     13\n          The scope of a taking was not simply an academic matter.\nBecause the use of force or fear had to coincide with the taking at\ncommon law, the narrow understanding of a taking significantly\nrestricted the scope of a robbery.      See William Blackstone, 4\nCommentaries * 242 (\"[I]f one privately steals sixpence from the\nperson of another, and afterwards keeps it by putting him in fear,\nthis is no robbery, for the fear is subsequent.\"); 4 Torcia, supra,\n§ 463 (\"At common law, . . . force or threatened force (putting a\nvictim in fear of injury) amounts to robbery only if it is used to\n'take' property from the possession of another.           Force or\nthreatened force used thereafter, in order to retain possession of\n\n                               -16-\n\f          Some modern cases have adopted the view that a \"taking\"\n\ncontinues until the defendant has achieved \"complete and exclusive\n\ncontrol\" over the property, which may be some time after the\n\ninitial seizure.   Jacobs v. United States, 861 A.2d 15, 21 (D.C.\n\n2004), judgment and opinion vacated and reissued, 886 A.2d 510\n\n(D.C. 2005).   Under that theory, \"a 'taking' is not complete --\n\nthat is to say, has not come to an end -- until the perpetrator has\n\nneutralized any immediate interference with his or her possession.\"\n\nState v. Mitchell, 675 S.E.2d 435, 438 (S.C. 2009) (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted); see also People v. Webster,\n\n814 P.2d 1273, 1289 (Cal. 1991) (\"The act of 'taking' begins when\n\nthe separation of the victim from his or her property occurs, and\n\nit continues through the forcible consummation.\").     A few cases\n\nhave applied that theory to the federal robbery statutes, see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Martin, 749 F.2d 1514, 1518 (11th Cir. 1985)\n\n(\"The 'taking' contemplated by [the federal Bank Robbery Act] is\n\nnot completed until 'the possibility of the item being recovered'\n\nhas ended,\" which \"continues so long as flight occurs from the\n\npossibility of hot pursuit.\" (quoting United States v. Jarboe, 513\n\nF.2d 33, 37 (8th Cir. 1975))), and some cases have used similar\n\nlanguage in the context of the carjacking statute, see, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Wright, 246 F.3d 1123, 1126 (8th Cir. 2001)\n\n(\"'Taking' for purposes of section 2119 is 'the acquisition by the\n\n\nthe property taken or to facilitate escape, does not qualify.\").\n\n                               -17-\n\frobber of possession, dominion or control of the property for some\n\nperiod of time.'\" (quoting United States v. Moore, 73 F.3d 666, 669\n\n(6th Cir. 1996)).\n\n            The   Supreme   Court      seems   to   have   endorsed    a   narrow\n\nunderstanding     of   \"taking\"   in    a   leading   carjacking      case.   In\n\nHolloway v. United States, the Court noted that the carjacking\n\nstatute's \"mens rea component . . . modifies the act of 'tak[ing]'\n\nthe motor vehicle.       It directs the factfinder's attention to the\n\ndefendant's state of mind at the precise moment he demanded or took\n\ncontrol over the car 'by force and violence or by intimidation.'\"\n\n526 U.S. 1, 8 (1999).        That passage equates the \"act of taking\"\n\nwith seizing control of the vehicle and suggests that the act\n\noccurs at a \"precise moment.\"          Of course, Holloway did not involve\n\nan extended carjacking/abduction like this case.             See id. at 4 n.3\n\n(\"[T]he accomplice produced his gun and threatened, '\"Get out of\n\nthe car or I'll shoot.\"'\"); see also Lebrón-Cepeda, 324 F.3d at 64\n\n(Howard, J., concurring) (arguing that Holloway did not address\n\n\"matters pertaining to what we have called 'the temporal limits' of\n\na carjacking\").        Nevertheless, it is an important data point to\n\nconsider.    Cf. SEC v. Rocklage, 470 F.3d 1, 7 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(\"Even dicta in Supreme Court opinions [are] looked on with great\n\ndeference.\").\n\n            In any case, it is not necessary to delimit the precise\n\nscope of a taking to see that the abduction rule is not grounded on\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fany settled understanding of the word \"taking.\"                   Even under the\n\nbroadest view, a taking ends once the victim has been subdued and\n\nthe defendant's control over the vehicle is \"complete.\"\n\n            2.    Nature of Carjacking\n\n            I noted above that certain offense conduct may be deemed\n\nto continue if \"the nature of the crime involved is such that\n\nCongress must assuredly have intended that it be treated as a\n\ncontinuing one.\"       Toussie, 397 U.S. at 115; see also United States\n\nv. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S. 275, 280 (1999) (\"[W]e have never\n\nbefore held, and decline to do so here, that verbs are the sole\n\nconsideration     in   identifying       the   conduct    that    constitutes      an\n\noffense.\").       It   is    possible,     then,   that    the    duration    of   a\n\ncarjacking might extend beyond the initial taking if it is by\n\n\"nature\" a continuing offense.\n\n            The robbery case law is instructive on this point.                  See\n\nJones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 235 (1999) (noting that\n\n\"carjacking is a type of robbery\" and that \"Congress modeled the\n\nfederal   carjacking        statute   on   several   other       federal   robbery\n\nstatutes\").      Federal and state courts have long held that the\n\noffense conduct for robbery does not end when the initial taking is\n\ncomplete.        Rather,    the   offense      conduct    continues   until     the\n\nperpetrator \"has won his way to a place of temporary safety\"\n\nbecause escape is \"inherent\" to the crime of robbery.                  Martinez-\n\nBermudez, 387 F.3d at 102; see also United States v. Williams, 344\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fF.3d 365, 372-73 (3d Cir. 2003) (collecting federal cases); United\n\nStates v. Garcia-Caraveo, 586 F.3d 1230, 1235-36 (10th Cir. 2009)\n\n(collecting state cases and statutes).14              On that theory, an\n\naccomplice can be convicted of aiding and abetting a robbery even\n\nif she participated in the escape phase only.         See United States v.\n\nJames, 998 F.2d 74, 80 (2d Cir. 1993).\n\n          This    court   adopted    a     similar   construction   of   the\n\ncarjacking statute in United States v. Martinez-Bermudez, 387 F.3d\n\n98 (1st Cir. 2004).   Reasoning in that case that \"flight with the\n\nvehicle is inherent to the crime\" of carjacking, we held that a\n\ncarjacking continues at least until the perpetrator \"has won his\n\nway to a place of temporary safety.\"        Id. at 102.   There is no need\n\nto question that interpretation here.         It is well-grounded in the\n\nrobbery case law and is consistent with familiar principles of\n\ncriminal law.    See United States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 4 & n.5\n\n(1st Cir. 1995). In any event, application of the temporary safety\n\nrule, if it applied, would not be enough to support Neliza's\n\nconviction in this case because the evidence does not suggest that\n\nshe helped Alberto and Gabriel escape from the scene of the\n\ncarjacking.\n\n          The California Supreme Court has broadened the temporary\n\nsafety rule in a way that is relevant to this case.          In People v.\n\n\n     14\n         The Ninth Circuit has taken the somewhat narrower view\nthat a robbery continues until the period of \"hot pursuit\" has\nended. United States v. Pike, 473 F.3d 1053, 1060 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\n                                    -20-\n\fStankewitz, 51 Cal.3d 72, 81 (1990), the defendant was given the\n\ndeath penalty based in part on a finding that he killed the victim\n\n\"during\" the commission of a robbery.    He challenged that finding\n\non appeal, arguing that he had reached a place of temporary safety\n\nbefore the victim was killed and therefore did not kill her\n\n\"during\" the robbery.   Id. at 101.    The California Supreme Court\n\ndisagreed:\n\n          So long as he held the robbery and kidnapping\n          victim, defendant's safety was continuously in\n          jeopardy. At any point in the journey, at any\n          one of the several stops the group made\n          between the Kmart and the killing scene, in\n          any unguarded moment, the victim might have\n          managed to escape or signal for help. There\n          was never a moment when defendant could\n          reasonably be said to have reached a place of\n          temporary safety.\n\nId.\n\n          Stankewitz provides what may be the best support for the\n\nview that the offense conduct for carjacking continues \"while the\n\ncarjacker maintains control over the victim and his or her car.\"\n\nAs far as I am aware, however, no other jurisdiction has adopted\n\nthe reasoning of Stankewitz.   Even in California, the rationale of\n\nStankewitz may not be transferable to questions of accomplice\n\nliability.   See People v. Cooper, 53 Cal.3d 1158, 1169 (1991)\n\n(\"[W]e decline to adopt the escape rule, applicable in the context\n\nof certain ancillary consequences of robbery, for purposes of\n\ndetermining aider and abettor liability.\").\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\f            Finally, to the extent that the legislative history may\n\nshed light on Congress's intent, it seems that Congress was simply\n\nnot thinking about extended carjacking/abductions when it enacted\n\n§ 2119.    See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 102-851, pt. 1, at 15 (1992) (\"In\n\n[an 'armed carjacking'], two or three criminals approach a car\n\nwaiting at a traffic light, or stopped by means of a deliberate\n\n'fender-bender' accident, and force the driver to turn over the\n\nkeys at gunpoint.\"); 138 Cong. Rec. S17,958-02 (daily ed. Oct. 8,\n\n1992) (statement of Sen. Lautenberg) (\"Increasingly, thieves are\n\nusing violence and intimidation to force drivers to give up their\n\ncars.\").\n\n            The text of the federal Bank Robbery Act, which served as\n\na model for the carjacking statute, reinforces this point.      That\n\nstatute contains a separate provision to cover robbery/abductions:\n\n            Whoever, in committing any offense defined in\n            this section, or in avoiding or attempting to\n            avoid apprehension for the commission of such\n            offense, or in freeing himself or attempting\n            to free himself from arrest or confinement for\n            such offense, . . . forces any person to\n            accompany him without the consent of such\n            person, shall be imprisoned not less than ten\n            years, or if death results shall be punished\n            by death or life imprisonment.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2113(e).    It would thus appear that Congress knows how\n\nto authorize the punishment of abductions when it wants to provide\n\nfor it.    \"That Congress failed to do so here argues forcefully that\n\nsuch authorization was not its intention.\"      Omni Capital Int'l,\n\nLtd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 106 (1987).\n\n                                 -22-\n\f          3.    First Circuit Precedent\n\n          The origins of the abduction rule in this circuit also\n\nraise doubts about its validity.       We developed the rule in two\n\ncases: Ramírez-Burgos v. United States, 313 F.3d 23 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\nand United States v. Lebrón-Cepeda, 324 F.3d 52 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(per curiam).    Ramírez-Burgos raised the issue of when a serious\n\nbodily injury \"results\" from a carjacking within the meaning of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119(2).    Lebrón-Cepeda raised the related issue of when\n\na killing is \"committed in the perpetration of\" a carjacking for\n\npurposes of the felony murder statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1111.15\n\n          We decided both cases on the assumption that, to be\n\npunishable, a serious bodily injury or killing must occur while the\n\noffense conduct is still continuing.      See Ramírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d\n\nat 30 (The term \"results\" includes \"injuries that were caused by\n\nthe actions of the carjacker at any time during the commission of\n\nthe carjacking.\"); Lebrón-Cepeda, 324 F.3d at 61 (\"Lebrón concedes\n\nthat the success of his challenge to the application of the\n\n[felony] murder cross reference depends on our finding that the\n\nkilling of Fontánez did not occur during the carjacking.\").      Both\n\ncases involved harms that occurred long after the vehicle had been\n\n\n     15\n          More precisely, Lebrón-Cepeda raised the issue in the\ncontext of the Sentencing Guidelines murder cross-reference, which\nis keyed to the murder statute. See USSG § 2B3.1(c) (\"If a victim\nwas killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under\n18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing taken place within the\nterritorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply\n§ 2A1.1 (First Degree Murder).\").\n\n                                -23-\n\fseized.    In explaining why those harms were properly considered in\n\npunishing the defendants, we expansively construed the carjacking\n\nstatute, holding that \"the commission of a carjacking continues at\n\nleast while the carjacker maintains control over the victim and her\n\ncar.\"     Ramírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d at 30 n.9.   We gave no further\n\nexplanation for that statement and cited a prior First Circuit case\n\nthat, on closer scrutiny, does not seem to provide the necessary\n\nsupport.    Id. (citing United States v. Vázquez-Rivera, 135 F.3d\n\n172, 178 (1st Cir. 1998)).16\n\n\n\n\n     16\n          In Vázquez-Rivera, we held that the \"if serious bodily\ninjury results\" provision is not limited to injuries that are\n\"'necessary to' or 'intended to effectuate' the taking of the\nvehicle itself.\" 135 F.3d at 178. Rather,\n\n     the choice of the word \"results\" . . . suggests that\n     Congress intended to cover a fairly broad range of\n     consequences flowing from a carjacking. Moreover, the\n     legislative history characterized the provision as\n     imposing the enhancement when the carjacking \"involves\n     bodily injury,\" which supports the view that the injuries\n     covered are not limited to those resulting from the\n     \"taking\" of a vehicle, but also include those caused by\n     the carjacker at any point during his or her retention of\n     the vehicle.\n\nId. (internal citation omitted). Although we suggested that our\ndiscussion implicated the \"temporal limits of the crime of\ncarjacking,\" it is clear that we were discussing the necessary\ncausal connection between the offense conduct and the resulting\nserious bodily injury. Id. But see Lebrón-Cepeda, 324 F.3d at 64\nn.4 (Howard, J., concurring) (recognizing that Vázquez-Rivera did\nnot \"explicitly\" state the abduction rule, but arguing that it\n\"implied as much when it held that a serious bodily injury\nsustained by a carjacking victim during a sexual assault that\nfollowed both the initial seizure of her vehicle and her kidnaping\n'result[ed]' from the carjacking\").\n\n                                 -24-\n\f              In retrospect, Ramírez-Burgos and Lebrón-Cepeda may have\n\nrested   on    an   erroneous   premise.   Cases   interpreting   similar\n\ncriminal statutes have not taken the view that an injury or killing\n\nmust happen while the offense conduct is still continuing to be\n\npunishable.\n\n              For example, of the many criminal statutes containing an\n\n\"if serious bodily injury results\" or \"if death results\" provision,\n\nI am not aware of any that have been interpreted to mean that the\n\noffense conduct must be technically ongoing at the time of the\n\ninjury or death.       Instead, the applicability of such provisions\n\nturns on a causation analysis.       See, e.g., United States v. De La\n\nCruz, 514 F.3d 121, 138 (1st Cir. 2008) (holding that death\n\n\"results\" from the use of illegally distributed drugs if the death\n\n\"was caused in fact by [the decedent's] use of drugs that were\n\ndistributed either by the defendant himself or by others in a\n\nconspiracy of which the defendant was a part\"); United States v.\n\nMarler, 756 F.2d 206, 216 (1st Cir. 1985) (holding that death\n\n\"results\" from a deprivation of civil rights if the death was \"a\n\nnatural and foreseeable result of the improper conduct\").            See\n\ngenerally United States v. Hatfield, 591 F.3d 945 (7th Cir. 2010).\n\nProof that the injury or death happened while the offense conduct\n\nwas continuing is neither necessary nor sufficient to show that the\n\nharm \"result[ed]\" from the offense.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f            Similarly, the felony murder rule does not require proof\n\nthat the underlying felony was technically ongoing when the killing\n\nhappened.    If the felony and the killing occur as part of the same\n\ncriminal transaction, the defendant will usually be liable for\n\nfelony murder.       See, e.g., State v. Rice, 184 S.W.3d 646, 663\n\n(Tenn. 2006) (\"The killing may precede, coincide with, or follow\n\nthe   felony   and    still    be     considered    as    occurring     'in    the\n\nperpetration   of'    the    felony    offense,    so    long   as   there    is   a\n\nconnection in time, place, and continuity of action.\") (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted); Erwin S. Barbre, What\n\nConstitutes Termination of Felony for Purpose of Felony-Murder\n\nRule, 58 A.L.R.3d 851, § 2[a] (1974) (stating that most courts\n\nrequire that \"the felony and homicide be part of a continuous\n\ntransaction, that the homicide be incident to the felony, or that\n\nthere be no break in the chain of events between the felony and the\n\nhomicide\").      Thus,   our    assumption    in    Lebrón-Cepeda      that    the\n\ndefendant's challenge could succeed only if we found that \"the\n\nkilling of [the victim] did not occur during the carjacking\" was\n\nprobably inaccurate.        324 F.3d at 61 (emphasis added).\n\n            In short, it may have been unnecessary for us to develop\n\nthe abduction rule in the first place.                   If we had applied a\n\ncausation analysis in Ramírez-Burgos and a transactional analysis\n\nin Lebrón-Cepeda, we would almost certainly have reached the same\n\nresult.     A rethinking of the abduction rule will not seriously\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fdisturb our settled precedent. Indeed, it would not affect Gabriel\n\nand    Alberto's     convictions   in    this   case.       They   were     properly\n\nconvicted as principals to the carjacking, and they can be held to\n\naccount for the \"result[ing]\" death of Pérez even if that death did\n\nnot occur until after the offense conduct had ended.\n\n             4.    Conclusion\n\n             All of these factors lead me to conclude that it is time\n\nto reconsider the abduction rule, which can lead to strange and\n\nseemingly arbitrary results.            In this case, Neliza is guilty of\n\ncarjacking simply because Gabriel and Alberto decided to keep Pérez\n\nin the car rather than abandon the car and hold Pérez captive in\n\nthe    house.      See   Ramírez-Burgos,       313   F.3d   at   30   n.9    (\"[T]he\n\ncommission of a carjacking continues at least while the carjacker\n\nmaintains control over the victim and her car.\") (emphasis added).\n\nMoreover, to the extent the question might be close, the rule of\n\nlenity and a presumption against continuing offenses17 might weigh\n\nin favor of a narrower interpretation of the carjacking statute.\n\n             The temporal scope of carjacking is likely to be a\n\nrecurring issue in this circuit.           It frequently arises in appeals\n\ninvolving the intent element of carjacking. See Lebrón-Cepeda, 324\n\nF.3d    at   62-66    (Howard,   J.,    concurring).        It     may   also   have\n\nimplications for venue, see Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S. at 281-82;\n\n\n       17\n          See Toussie, 397 U.S. at 115; id. at 135 (White, J.,\ndissenting); United States v. Johnson, 323 U.S. 273, 278 (1945).\nBut see United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 413 (1980).\n\n                                        -27-\n\fstatutes of limitations, see Toussie, 397 U.S. at 114; ex post\n\nfacto challenges, see United States v. Muñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d 25,\n\n55 (1st Cir. 2007); and Double Jeopardy challenges, see Brown v.\n\nOhio, 432 U.S. 161, 169-70 & n.8 (1977); Blockburger v. United\n\nStates, 284 U.S. 299, 302 (1932).      If we intend to adhere to an\n\ninterpretation with such important consequences, we should at least\n\nprovide a more fully reasoned justification for our decision.18\n\nD.   Conspiracy\n\n           Neliza's challenge to her conspiracy conviction also goes\n\nto the timing of the offense.       She argues that \"the evidence\n\npresented at trial failed to establish that she was a member of the\n\nconspiracy when the forcible taking of the vehicle occurred.\"19\n\nHowever, conspiracy, like carjacking in this circuit, is often a\n\ncontinuing offense. Muñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d at 55 n.32. As alleged\n\nin the indictment and implicitly found by the jury, the conspiracy\n\nin this case continued at least while Pérez was held hostage.   See\n\nPapa, 555 F.3d at 36 n.3 (\"[A] conspiracy generally ends when the\n\ndesign to commit substantive misconduct ends . . . .\") (quoting\n\n\n\n     18\n          In questioning the validity of Neliza's carjacking\nconviction, I do not in any way minimize the seriousness of her\nalleged conduct. She could certainly have been held to answer for\nthat conduct under the laws of Puerto Rico, and she might have been\ncharged federally as an accessory after the fact like her brother\nJosé, see 18 U.S.C. § 3.\n     19\n          She also suggests in passing that she did not have the\nnecessary intent. As with the carjacking count, we deem her intent\nargument waived for lack of development. Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n                                -28-\n\fPyramid Sec. Ltd. v. IB Resolution, Inc., 924 F.2d 1114, 1117-18\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1991)).20\n\n           Although there is no evidence that Neliza was involved\n\nduring the initial planning phase, \"the government does not need to\n\nshow as a precursor to a finding of guilt that a given defendant\n\ntook part in all aspects of the conspiracy.\"             United States v.\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993).        The evidence of her\n\nlater involvement provided a sufficient basis for the jury to infer\n\nthat she knew of Alberto and Gabriel's plan, shared their common\n\npurpose, and acted to further that plan or purpose.           No more was\n\nneeded to sustain her conviction.\n\nE.   Firearm Count\n\n           Neliza's final sufficiency of the evidence argument goes\n\nto her conviction on the firearm count.           The indictment alleged\n\nthat she aided and abetted Alberto and Gabriel in their use and\n\ncarriage   of   a   firearm   during   the   carjacking.21   To   secure   a\n\n\n\n     20\n          Of course, the duration of the conspiracy to commit\ncarjacking is linked to the duration of the carjacking itself. We\ndo not purport to decide what effect, if any, an abandonment of the\nabduction rule would have on Neliza's conspiracy conviction.\n     21\n          Neliza was sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of seven\nyears under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), which applies when a\nfirearm is \"brandished.\" It is not clear what facts justified that\nenhanced sentence or whether the district court even made the\nnecessary findings before imposing it.      See Harris v. United\nStates, 536 U.S. 545, 556 (2002) (holding that \"brandishing and\ndischarging [are] sentencing factors to be found by the judge\").\nOur conclusion that the conviction cannot stand makes it\nunnecessary to address those issues.\n\n                                   -29-\n\fconviction on that count, the government had to prove that Neliza\n\nknew \"to a practical certainty\" that her confederates would carry\n\nor use a firearm and that she \"willingly took some step to\n\nfacilitate the carrying or use.\"                   United States v. Medina-Román,\n\n376 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              We are frankly at a loss to understand what evidence\n\ncould have supported a finding of guilt under that standard.                    As we\n\nhave said, there is no evidence that Neliza was involved in the\n\ninitial seizure of the car. Moreover, while there is evidence that\n\nAlberto carried a firearm throughout the entire episode, there is\n\nno evidence that Neliza was aware of the firearm or that she took\n\nany   steps    to    facilitate       the    carrying     of   the   firearm.     The\n\ngovernment has not assisted us at all in this regard.                      It either\n\noverlooked Neliza's argument or chose not to respond to it.\n\n              Under the circumstances, we must conclude that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support Neliza's conviction on the firearm\n\ncount.   It was unreasonable for the jury to find Neliza guilty in\n\nthe absence of any proof that she knowingly facilitated the use or\n\ncarriage of the firearm. See United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63\n\nF.3d 1142, 1151-52 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                            III.\n\n              We    turn   now   to   Neliza's       evidentiary     and   procedural\n\narguments in support of her request for a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -30-\n\fA.   Alberto's Phone Conversation\n\n           At trial, the government introduced the recording of a\n\ntelephone conversation between Alberto and his mother:\n\n           Alberto:         Neliza is the one who's talking.\n\n           Mother:          Really?\n\n           Alberto:         I saw the sworn statement.\n\n           Mother:          Yes, the police told me.\n\n           Alberto:         Yeah?   That bitch is going to\n                            fuck us over. We can't talk too\n                            much through here, either.\n\n           Mother:          They told me that she talked\n                            really bad -- that she was\n                            talking about . . .\n\n           Alberto:         I saw the sworn statement,\n                            that's all I have to say. I\n                            went to court yesterday.\n\n           Neliza     argues    that    the     introduction    of   the    phone\n\nconversation violated her rights under the Confrontation Clause,\n\nwhich provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused\n\nshall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses\n\nagainst   him.\"      U.S.   Const.     amend.    VI.   The     Supreme     Court's\n\ndecisions in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), and Davis\n\nv. Washington, 547 U.S. 813 (2006), define the basic contours of\n\nthe Confrontation Clause as it applies to out-of-court statements.\n\nUnder those cases, \"testimonial\" statements may not be admitted as\n\nevidence of a defendant's guilt unless the declarant can be cross-\n\nexamined on the witness stand at trial or, if the declarant is\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\funavailable,     the        defendant    had    a   prior       opportunity     for\n\ncross-examination.          See Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 129 S. Ct.\n\n2527, 2531 (2009); Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 413 (2007).\n\nNon-testimonial      statements,        by   contrast,    do    not   \"cause   the\n\ndeclarant to be a 'witness'\" within the meaning of the Sixth\n\nAmendment and thus are \"not subject to the Confrontation Clause.\"\n\nDavis, 547 U.S. at 821.\n\n            In multi-defendant trials like this one, an additional\n\nlayer of analysis may be necessary.            When the prosecution seeks to\n\nintroduce a statement made by one of the defendants, the statement\n\nwill     typically     be     admissible     against     that    defendant     (the\n\ndeclarant), who has no constitutional right to confront himself.\n\nSee United States v. Rios Ruiz, 579 F.2d 670, 676-77 (1st Cir.\n\n1978);     United States v. Brown, 441 F.3d 1330, 1359 (11th Cir.\n\n2006); 4 Jack B. Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's\n\nFederal Evidence § 802.05[3][d] (2d ed. 2005). But introduction of\n\nthe statement may raise confrontation problems with respect to the\n\nother defendants if the declarant exercises his right not to\n\ntestify at trial.\n\n            Before Crawford and Davis were decided, the Supreme Court\n\ndeveloped a two-tiered framework for determining admissibility when\n\na non-testifying defendant's statement is proffered at trial.\n\nStatements that facially incriminate a co-defendant are per se\n\ninadmissible under the rule of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S.\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\f123 (1968).     See also Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185, 192 (1998).\n\nBy contrast, statements that incriminate a co-defendant \"only when\n\nlinked with evidence introduced later at trial\" can be admitted if\n\nreferences    to   the   co-defendant   are   redacted    and    the   jury    is\n\ninstructed not to consider the statement against any defendant\n\nother than the declarant.      Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 208,\n\n211 (1987).    We presume in the latter situation that the jury will\n\nfollow instructions and consider the statement only for the proper\n\npurpose (assessing the declarant's guilt) and not the improper\n\npurpose (assessing the co-defendant's guilt).            See id. at 206-07,\n\n211.\n\n             The Bruton/Richardson framework presupposes that the\n\naggrieved co-defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to confront the\n\ndeclarant in the first place.      If none of the co-defendants has a\n\nconstitutional right to confront the declarant, none can complain\n\nthat his right has been denied.           It is thus necessary to view\n\nBruton through the lens of Crawford and Davis.                  The threshold\n\nquestion in every case is whether the challenged statement is\n\ntestimonial.       If it is not, the Confrontation Clause \"has no\n\napplication.\" Bockting, 549 U.S. at 420; see also United States v.\n\nJohnson, 581 F.3d 320, 326 (6th Cir. 2009) (\"Because it is premised\n\non     the   Confrontation    Clause,   the    Bruton     rule,    like       the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fConfrontation Clause itself, does not apply to nontestimonial\n\nstatements.\").22\n\n           Applying these principles, we conclude that Neliza's\n\nconfrontation       argument    is     without    merit.    We    considered    the\n\ncharacter of the phone conversation in the companion opinion,\n\nholding that the statements made by Alberto and his mother were not\n\ntestimonial.        See Castro-Davis, Nos. 08-2108, 08-2109.                   As a\n\nconsequence,    Neliza       has     no   constitutional   right    to     confront\n\nAlberto.      Her    claim     under      the   Confrontation    Clause,    whether\n\ndenominated a Crawford challenge or a Bruton challenge, must be\n\nrejected.23    Johnson, 581 F.3d at 326.\n\n\n\n\n     22\n          Accord United States v. Smalls, 605 F.3d 765, 768 n.2\n(10th Cir. 2010); United States v. Avila Vargas, 570 F.3d 1004,\n1008-09 (8th Cir. 2009); Thomas v. United States, 978 A.2d 1211,\n1224-25 (D.C. 2009); United States v.

Mueller & Laird C.\nKirkpatrick, Federal Evidence § 1:40 (3d ed. 2007).\n     23\n          Of course, the phone conversation must still meet the\nrequirements of the Federal Rules of Evidence. See Johnson, 581 at\n325-26. The district court ruled that the phone conversation was\nhearsay but nevertheless admissible against Neliza as a statement\nagainst penal interest.    See Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3).      Neliza\nchallenges that ruling on appeal, arguing that nothing in the phone\nconversation was against her (Neliza's) penal interest. That is\nnot the relevant inquiry, however. Rule 804(b)(3) requires the\ndistrict court to ask whether the statement at issue \"so far tended\nto subject the declarant\" -- in this case, Alberto -- \"to . . .\ncriminal liability . . . that a reasonable person in the\ndeclarant's position would not have made the statement unless\nbelieving it to be true.\" Id. (emphasis added). Neliza makes no\nargument on that issue, and we decline to address it without the\nbenefit of briefing.\n\n                                          -34-\n\fB.   Gabriel's Statement\n\n           Neliza also raises a Confrontation Clause challenge with\n\nrespect to the trial testimony of FBI agent Eric Gonima.                In his\n\ntestimony, Gonima recounted the details of a post-arrest interview\n\nhe conducted with Gabriel. Gabriel denied all involvement with the\n\ncarjacking and killing of Pérez in the interview.                 He briefly\n\nmentioned Neliza, acknowledging that she had been his girlfriend\n\nand that he knew her family, though \"not very well.\"            Neliza argues\n\nthat it was erroneous for the district court to admit the testimony\n\nwithout instructing the jury that Gabriel's statement could not be\n\nconsidered as evidence against her.          See Richardson, 481 U.S. at\n\n211.   Because she objected at trial, we review her claim de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d 511, 519 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Gabriel's      statement     to   the   FBI    was     undoubtedly\n\ntestimonial,   and   it   therefore     falls   within   the    scope   of   the\n\nConfrontation Clause.        We would ordinarily ask at this point\n\nwhether the statement was \"inculpatory on its face\" with respect to\n\nNeliza.   Id. at 520.      There is no need to undertake that inquiry\n\nhere, however, because the government concedes that even if the\n\nstatement was admissible, it was error to admit it without a\n\nlimiting instruction.       See id. at 521 (\"Supreme Court case law\n\nmakes clear that the trial court ordinarily should instruct the\n\njury that one defendant's out-of-court confession may not be used\n\nagainst his codefendants in a joint trial.\").\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\f           Nevertheless, the government says, the district court's\n\nerror was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.       We agree.   The only\n\nfact about Neliza that was directly or indirectly revealed through\n\nGabriel's statement was the existence of her relationship with\n\nGabriel.    But   that   relationship   was   already   well-established\n\nthrough José's testimony and the testimony of neighbors. Gabriel's\n\nstatement added no new information in that regard.         Any error in\n\nadmitting the statement without a limiting instruction was harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nC.   Peremptory Challenges\n\n           Neliza criticizes the district court's procedure for\n\nexercising peremptory challenges at voir dire. Because she did not\n\nmake a contemporaneous objection, we review for plain error.\n\n           Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24 sets forth the\n\nnumber of regular peremptory challenges that the parties may\n\nexercise and grants them several \"additional\" challenges that \"may\n\nbe used only to remove alternate jurors.\"       We have interpreted the\n\nrule to mean that the district court must designate particular\n\nmembers of the venire as prospective alternate jurors and must\n\nlimit the parties' additional challenges to that group. See United\n\nStates v. González-Meléndez, 594 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 2010).       The\n\ndistrict court failed to follow that procedure in this case.\n\nRather than separating the parties' regular strikes from their\n\nadditional strikes, it required the parties to exercise all of\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\ftheir    strikes   at   once    against   an   undifferentiated   panel   of\n\nprospective jurors.      That was error, as the government concedes.\n\n            Nevertheless, Neliza has not shown that the error was\n\nprejudicial.    See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 735 (1993)\n\n(plain error standard generally requires the defendant to show that\n\nthe     error   \"affected      the   outcome    of   the   district   court\n\nproceedings\").     She argues that she suffered prejudice because one\n\nof the regular jurors was excused and replaced by an alternate\n\njuror.     We rejected that same argument on materially identical\n\nfacts in United States v. González-Meléndez, a decision made under\n\nthe Rule 52(a) harmless error standard:\n\n            Gonzalez-Melendez . . . distinguishes [United\n            States v. Brown, 510 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 2007)\n            and United States v. Flaherty, 668 F.2d 566\n            (1st Cir. 1981), where we found similar errors\n            to be harmless]. Unlike in those cases, he\n            observes, in this case an alternate juror was\n            actually seated. Thus, he claims, prejudice\n            is readily apparent in his case.\n\n            We do not see how that conclusion follows. It\n            is not evident that the composition of the\n            jury would have differed had the district\n            court adhered to Rule 24(c)(4).      Moreover,\n            even if a different venire member would have\n            been selected as the alternate juror, there is\n            no basis in the record for concluding that the\n            alteration   in   jury  composition   had   an\n            injurious    influence    on   the    verdict.\n            Therefore, we conclude that the court's error\n            was harmless.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\f594 F.3d at 34.   As in González-Meléndez, there is no evidence here\n\nthat the district court's error injuriously affected the outcome of\n\nthe proceedings.24\n\nD.   Jury Note\n\n           Neliza's final procedural claim relates to a note sent by\n\nthe jury during deliberations.    The note, which was made part of\n\nthe record, stated that the jury would like to \"hear again the\n\nphone conversation between [Alberto] and his mother.\" The district\n\ncourt's minute entry from that day indicates that the note was\n\n\"received and discussed with counsel,\" but there is no indication\n\nwhat action, if any, was taken in response.    The trial transcript\n\ncontains no record of any proceedings involving the jury note.\n\n           Neliza argues that she was never informed of the note.\n\nAlthough the minute entry contradicts her assertion, she has\n\nincluded in the addendum to her brief an e-mail in which her trial\n\ncounsel denies any knowledge about how the note was handled.     We\n\ndecline Neliza's invitation to delve into this dispute on the basis\n\nof unsworn evidence that was never presented to the district court.\n\nThere are various avenues available to a party who seeks to remedy\n\na perceived omission or misstatement in the record.     See Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 10(c), (e); 16A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal\n\n\n\n     24\n          This conclusion does not lessen our concern about the\ndistrict court's violation of the rule applicable to the selection\nof alternate jurors.   In the future, the district court should\nscrupulously comply with Rule 24.\n\n                                 -38-\n\fPractice & Procedure § 3956.4 (3d ed. 1999 & Supp. 2008).            But\n\ninserting new evidence into the addendum of a brief is not one of\n\nthose avenues.    The e-mail is stricken from the record, and we\n\ndisregard Neliza's argument because it depends on the improperly\n\nincluded material.     See Nicholson v. Hyannis Air Serv., Inc., 580\n\nF.3d 1116, 1128 (9th Cir. 2009).\n\n          We note that similar allegations regarding the handling\n\nof a jury note were made in González-Meléndez, which was tried by\n\ndifferent attorneys before the same district court judge.         In that\n\ncase, as here, the trial transcript contained no record of any\n\nproceedings relating to the jury note.         Because this issue may\n\nrecur, we emphasize again that proceedings in response to a jury\n\nnote should be conducted on the record.            See United States v.\n\nOfray-Campos, 534 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2008) (describing the proper\n\nprocedure); United States v. Rodriguez, 67 F.3d 1312, 1316 (7th\n\nCir. 1995); 28 U.S.C. § 753(b).\n\n                                   IV.\n\n          For    the   reasons   stated   above,   we   AFFIRM   Neliza's\n\nconvictions on Count I (conspiracy) and Count II (carjacking),\n\nREVERSE her conviction on Count III (carriage or use of a firearm\n\nduring a crime of violence), and REMAND for resentencing.\n\n          SO ORDERED.\n\n          – Concurring and Dissenting Opinion Follows –\n\n\n\n\n                                  -39-\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in part; Dissenting\n\nin part).     My colleagues have written a cogent and well-reasoned\n\nopinion, much of which I agree with.                 However, because \"we cannot\n\naffirm a criminal conviction on the basis of a theory not presented\n\nto the jury,\" I must dissent.           Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S.\n\n222, 236 (1980).\n\n             To   begin,    I    reprise      the    relevant    facts.    Alberto,\n\nGabriel, and Neliza were indicted on the same charges and tried\n\njointly.25    There was enough direct and circumstantial evidence\n\npresented to the jury to permit it to find that Alberto and Gabriel\n\ntook Pérez's car from his person by violence or intimidation, with\n\nthe aid of a firearm, and that sometime after this \"physical\n\ntaking\"   they    brought       Pérez   and    his    car   to   José's   house   for\n\nsafekeeping.26      See Castro-Davis, Nos. 08-2108, 08-2109.                      The\n\nevidence as to Neliza's involvement on the other hand, was not so\n\nclear.    I agree with the majority that there was no evidence\n\npresented that would allow a jury to make a reasonable inference\n\nthat Neliza was involved in the planning stages of the carjacking,\n\n\n     25\n      Count I of the indictment charged defendants under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 371 (conspiracy to commit carjacking), Count II under 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 2119(3) and 2 (aiding and abetting a carjacking resulting in\ndeath), and Count III under 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 2\n(using or carrying a firearm in connection with a carjacking).\n     26\n      I will refer to \"physical taking\" as the time period during\nwhich the carjacker obtains possession of a motor vehicle while in\nthe presence of another.    In the present case, that \"physical\ntaking\" ended once Pérez and his car were captured by the\ncarjackers and one of them began to drive it.\n\n                                        -40-\n\for that she was involved at the \"physical taking\" of the car from\n\nPérez's person.       See Maj. Op. at 9.\n\n            The evidence at trial instead showed that Neliza first\n\nbecame involved when she called her brother, José, and told him to\n\nstep outside his home to receive Gabriel.                  That phone call,\n\nhowever, did not establish that Neliza knew anything about the\n\ncarjacking.     José testified that soon after receiving the call, he\n\nstepped outside to meet Gabriel.             His testimony was completely\n\ndevoid of any mention of Neliza.           Conspicuously absent from the\n\nrecord    was   any   inquiry   from   the    government    as   to   Neliza's\n\nwhereabouts at this point in José's testimony.27            As the majority\n\nopinion makes clear, the first time there was any evidence that\n\nNeliza learned of the carjacking was many hours after the \"physical\n\ntaking\" of Pérez and his car.28\n\n\n     27\n       A reading of the trial transcript evinces copious use of the\nword \"they\" by both the prosecution and witnesses, with no attempt\nmade to clarify whether \"they\" referred to Alberto, Gabriel and\nNeliza; Alberto and Gabriel; or some other combination of the\nthree.    In fact, when José testifies that Gabriel and Alberto\nbrought Pérez to the house, the prosecutor does not ask whether\nNeliza (who José had testified had called him to come out of his\nhouse to receive Gabriel) also came with Alberto and Gabriel.\nInstead, the prosecutor next asks José: \"Okay. So you were told\nthat Gabby and whoever were going to an ATM machine . . . .\"\n(emphasis added). As the majority points out, the government seems\nto have chosen the same strategy on this appeal, referring to\nappellants generically as \"appellants\" and not individually. Maj.\nOp. at 9 n.7.\n     28\n      All the evidence points to the \"physical taking\" taking place\nin the early hours of the afternoon. José testified that it was\n\"getting dark\" when Neliza called.     The official record of the\nAstronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Navy indicates\n\n                                   -41-\n\f          As the majority well-states the law, a person cannot be\n\nfound guilty of aiding and abetting a crime that already has been\n\ncommitted.   See SEC v. Papa, 555 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2009); see\n\nalso Maj. Op. at 6-7.    Similarly for conspiracy.   See United States\n\nv. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1021 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"Under the\n\ndoctrine of Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 645-46\n\n(1946), a defendant co-conspirator may be held responsible for a\n\nsubstantive crime committed by another conspirator in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy if that crime is committed while the defendant\n\nco-conspirator is a member of the conspiracy.\" (emphasis added)).\n\n          The issue here is therefore about timing. Since Neliza's\n\ninvolvement could only be found by a reasonable jury after the\n\n\"physical taking\" of Pérez and his car took place, her conviction\n\nmust be overturned unless the offense of carjacking continued until\n\nthe time when Neliza first became involved.      The majority holds\n\nthat the law of this circuit is such that the offense conduct of\n\ncarjacking in this case was still ongoing after the \"physical\n\ntaking\" since Alberto and Gabriel remained in control of the victim\n\nPérez and his car.      It thus concludes that there was sufficient\n\nevidence presented to the jury to convict Neliza based on the\n\n\n\nthat sundown was at 7:04 pm on July 15, 2006. Naval Oceanography\nPortal: Sun Or Moon Rise/Set Table for One Year: U.S. Cities and\nTowns at http//www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/\ndata-services/rs-one-year-us (last visited June 15, 2010).       At\nleast three hours, and probably closer to five hours passed between\nthe \"physical taking\" and Neliza's involvement.\n\n                                 -42-\n\ftheory that the offense conduct of carjacking is ongoing so long as\n\n\"the carjacker maintains control over the victim and [his or her]\n\ncar.\"    See Maj. Op. at 24 (quoting Ramírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d at 30\n\nn.9).\n\n               I do not disagree with the majority's reading of our case\n\nlaw, although I have serious reservations about the correctness of\n\nthe abduction rule. First, as the majority explains, the abduction\n\nrule was grounded on a case that does not actually support it.              See\n\nRamírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d 23, 30 n.9 (1st Cir. 2002)(citing United\n\nStates    v.    Vázquez-Rivera,   135   F.3d   172,   178   (1st   Cir.   1998)\n\n(Torruella, C.J.) for the proposition that \"the commission of a\n\ncarjacking continues at least while the carjacker maintains control\n\nover the victim and her car.\"); see also Maj. Op. at 21 n.12.               We\n\nappear to have mechanically repeated this phrase in subsequent\n\nopinions without explanation.       See, e.g., United States v. Lebrón-\n\nCepeda, 324 F.3d 52, 61 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Matos-\n\nQuiñones, 456 F.3d 14, 19 n.4 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v.\n\nMartínez-Bermúdez, 387 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n               Second, the abduction rule shifts the issue from a causal\n\nanalysis of whether serious bodily injury (§ 2119(2)) or death\n\n(§ 2119(3)) results (is causally connected to) to an inquiry that\n\nmechanically ends when the carjacker releases the victim and her\n\ncar.     See Ramírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d at 30.          In my view, this is a\n\nmisreading of the statute.         As the majority explains, the word\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\f\"results\" merely indicates a causal connection, one not necessarily\n\ncircumscribed     by    the   time   when   the   offense   conduct   of   the\n\ncarjacking ends.       As an example, it seems clear that if a defendant\n\ntook a car, shot the victim in the process, and abandoned the car\n\nan hour later, we would not say the crime was ongoing over the\n\ncourse of the three weeks it took for the victim to languish in the\n\nhospital and die.       It also seems clear that in that situation, the\n\ncarjacker could be convicted under the plain language of § 2119(3).\n\nHowever, under our current abduction rule, he might not be.\n\n             Finally, and as relevant later, I do not see where the\n\nabduction rule is in any way supported by the plain language of the\n\nstatute,29 whether by a plain and commonsensical definition of the\n\nword \"take\" -- \"to get into one's hands or into one's possession,\n\npower or control by force or stratagem\"30 -- or as derived from the\n\ncommon law of robbery and larceny.          It is not apparent to me why a\n\nreasonable person would read the carjacking statute and believe\n\n\n     29\n          18 U.S.C. § 2119(3) reads:\n\n     Whoever with the intent to cause death or serious bodily\n     harm takes a motor vehicle that has been transported,\n     shipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce\n     from the person or presence of another by force and\n     violence or by intimidation, or attempts to do so, shall\n     . . . if death results, be fined under this title or\n     imprisoned, any number of years up to life, or both, or\n     sentenced to death.\n\n(emphasis added).\n     30\n      Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged 2329\n(1976).\n\n                                     -44-\n\fthat the \"taking\" of a car under the statute continues while the\n\ncarjacker maintains control over the victim and his or her car.   I\n\nsimply do not see how a reasonable person would assume that\n\n\"tak[ing] a motor vehicle . . . from the person or presence of\n\nanother by force and violence or by intimidation,\" § 2119(3), is an\n\nact that continues past the moment when the carjacker has obtained\n\n(i.e., already taken) clear possession (in this case, sometime\n\nbefore Alberto and Gabriel arrived at José's house).\n\n          While I concur with the majority's analysis of our\n\ncurrent law and join in calling for the en banc court to correct\n\nthis error promptly, I nevertheless cannot join their conclusion.31\n\nAlthough it may well be the law of our circuit, the abduction rule\n\ntheory was never presented to the jury as a basis of conviction.\n\nIndeed, the jury was told they could convict on the basis of what\n\nthe majority calls \"pure conjecture.\"     See Chiarella v. United\n\nStates, 445 U.S. at 236 (finding that \"we cannot affirm a criminal\n\nconviction on the basis of a theory not presented to the jury\");\n\nCola v. Reardon, 787 F.2d 681, 693 (1st Cir. 1986) (holding that it\n\nis in violation of due process to affirm a conviction on a basis\n\nneither set forth in the indictment nor presented to the jury at\n\ntrial); see also Dunn v. United States, 442 U.S. 100, 106 (1979)\n\n(holding that \"[t]o uphold a conviction on a charge that was\n\n\n\n     31\n      I do, however, join the majority's conclusion that there was\nno evidence to support the gun charge against Neliza.\n\n                               -45-\n\fneither alleged in the indictment nor presented to a jury at trial\n\noffends the most basic notions of due process.\").\n\n          At closing arguments, the government asked the jury to\n\ninfer that Neliza was involved at the time of the physical taking\n\nof the vehicle from Pérez, arguing that it had been Neliza who\n\ndrove Gabriel and Alberto to the site of the carjacking because\n\n\"[s]omeone had to keep a gun on [Pérez]\" or he would have escaped.\n\nThe government presented no evidence to support this theory nor did\n\nit posit any other theory under which the jury should find Neliza\n\nguilty.   The jury was never told that Neliza could be legally\n\nconvicted even if the jury found that she first learned of the\n\ncarjacking after the \"physical taking\" had occurred, while Alberto\n\nand Gabriel maintained control over Pérez and his car.         See\n\nRamírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d at 30 n.9.   Significantly, the government\n\nnever argued the \"abduction rule\" as the law of the circuit,\n\nneither at trial nor in its appellate brief.32        Instead, the\n\ngovernment asked the jury to infer from the evidence presented that\n\nNeliza was involved in the \"physical taking\" of the carjacking, or\n\npossibly even before it, and that she must have known there was a\n\ngun being used on Pérez.   The majority finds correctly that this\n\n\n\n     32\n      Indeed, the government's appellate brief cites most of the\ncases the majority discusses as setting out the abduction rule, but\nit cites them for the issue of whether sufficient evidence was\npresented as to the conditional intent to cause serious bodily harm\nor death. See Gov't Brief at 21-23. Naturally, Neliza also did\nnot raise this theory at trial or on appeal.\n\n                               -46-\n\ftheory was \"pure conjecture\" and that there was not sufficient\n\nevidence for a reasonable jury to convict Neliza based on this\n\ntheory.   See Maj. Op. at 9.\n\n            The instructions given to the jury were also unclear as\n\nto the temporal bounds of the offense conduct of carjacking, never\n\nspecifying that the offense conduct included the time after the\n\n\"physical taking\" and that as such, Neliza could be convicted if\n\nthe jury found she was involved after Pérez and his car arrived to\n\nJosé's house.       Specifically, the jury was instructed that they\n\nshould convict if they found that the defendants either conspired\n\nor aided and abetted each other in \"taking Mr. Pérez's Mazda by\n\nforce and intimidation with intent to cause death and serious\n\nbodily harm by force, violence, and intimidation, and actually\n\nresulting in death.\"     The instructions were not improper as to the\n\nelements,    they   essentially   mirrored   the   carjacking   statute.\n\nHowever, they did not clarify what those elements meant.            The\n\ninstructions left up to the mind of the jury to define \"taking\" in\n\nwhat I view as an unsupportable extension -- that is, as including\n\nthe conduct of defendants after they arrived at José's house.        By\n\nnot defining our case law on the subject of carjacking and not\n\nspecifying that the act of carjacking in this case would legally\n\ncontinue up until the moment that the carjackers lost control of\n\nthe victim or his car, and because this is by no means an obvious\n\nor natural interpretation of the instructions, the only inference\n\n\n                                  -47-\n\fwe have left is that the jury convicted Neliza on the government's\n\ntheory at trial which the majority now finds to be insufficient to\n\nsustain her conviction.\n\n          \"The Supreme Court has ruled that where a jury is given\n\nthe option of choosing between factually adequate and factually\n\ninadequate theories of guilt, jurors 'are well equipped to analyze\n\nthe evidence' and can be counted upon to base their verdict upon\n\nthe factually adequate theory.\"       Santellan v. Cockrell, 271 F.3d\n\n190, 196 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing Griffin v. United States,              502\n\nU.S. 46, 59 (1991)).     However, that is not the case here.     Here the\n\njury was given one theory of guilt: that Neliza was present at the\n\nmoment of the \"physical taking.\"          The jury was never told the\n\ntheory that the majority now uses to affirm her conviction: that\n\nNeliza was involved after the \"physical taking\" but while the\n\ncarjackers remained in control of Pérez and his car.        That a jury\n\nmight have \"divined [this] theory from the facts\" and from the law\n\nas read to them in the jury instructions is not sufficient.        Cola,\n\n787 F.2d at 699 n.19.     \"The problem with th[at] view . . . is the\n\nserious risk involved that the jury did not so divine the appellate\n\ntheory, and instead, that it convicted based on the erroneous or\n\nnoncriminal   theories    before   it.\"    Id.   Barring   any   kind    of\n\nexplanation as to the law of our circuit explaining the abduction\n\nrule, I simply do not see how a jury might have divined it.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -48-\n\f             I view this case as analogous to the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Chiarella.          445 U.S. 222.     In that case, the employer\n\nof a financial printer engaged to print corporate takeover bids was\n\nconvicted based on his purchase of stock in target companies\n\nwithout informing its shareholders of his knowledge of proposed\n\ntakeovers.    Id. at 224-25.       The Supreme Court held that his conduct\n\ndid not violate the Securities Exchange Act and thus his conviction\n\nwas improper.       Id. at 224-35.        In its brief to the Court, the\n\ngovernment for the first time offered an alternative theory to\n\nsupport the conviction, arguing that petitioner's conviction could\n\nbe affirmed on the basis that he owed a duty to the corporation\n\nthat had hired the printing company.             Id.   at 235.33      The Supreme\n\nCourt reaffirmed the maxim that \"we cannot affirm a criminal\n\nconviction on the basis of a theory not presented to the jury,\" and\n\nheld that the jury instructions and the government's theory at\n\ntrial     showed   that   the    jury   had    convicted   on   the    theory   of\n\npetitioner's failure to disclose to shareholders, and not on a duty\n\nowed to anyone else.       Id. at 236.\n\n             Similarly in our previous decision in Cola, 787 F.2d 681,\n\nwe granted habeas because the defendant had no notice at trial of\n\nthe theory which was eventually used by the state appeals court to\n\nuphold his conviction.          Citing to Dunn, 442 U.S. 100, and granting\n\n\n\n     33\n      I note that the government in this case has not brought up\nthe abduction rule at any point in these proceedings.\n\n                                        -49-\n\fhabeas, we worried about the \"sixth amendment problems of whether\n\ndefendants   have   ever   been   presented   with   an   opportunity   to\n\nconfront, in a fact-finding forum, the government's final theory of\n\nguilt\" and noted that it was \"not clear whether an opportunity has\n\nbeen provided to have guilt determined by a jury in the first\n\ninstance [on that theory].\"       Cola, 787 F.2d at 701.    Just like in\n\nDunn, our court found that \"the prosecution in Cola's trial did not\n\nbuild its case on the evidence supporting the appellate theory,\"\n\nand rejected the assumption \"that the jury would somehow divine,\n\nand independently articulate, the appellate theory.\"         Id. at 700;\n\nDunn, 442 U.S. at 106 (\"[W]hile there was no variance between the\n\nindictment and proof at trial, there was a discrepancy between the\n\nbasis on which the jury rendered its verdict and that on which the\n\nCourt of Appeals sustained petitioner's conviction.\").\n\n          That there was evidence presented sufficient to convict\n\nNeliza as an accessory after the fact under 18 U.S.C. § 3, there is\n\nno doubt in my mind.34      However, the government did not charge\n\nNeliza as an accessory after the fact.        Neliza was charged in the\n\nsame way as Alberto and Gabriel: as an aider and abettor and\n\nconspirator to carjacking and to carrying a firearm during a\n\ncarjacking. The firearm charge proved to be patently baseless, and\n\n\n\n     34\n      Neliza can also be properly charged in the Commonwealth\ncourts for the various state crimes which, if proven by proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, could very well result in her conviction\nfor several serious felony offenses.\n\n                                   -50-\n\fa directed verdict should have been entered by the district court\n\nupon Neliza's Rule 50 motion.    We correct that error now and I\n\nfully join the majority in its decision as to that charge.    But\n\nbecause the majority upholds Neliza's conviction on a theory which\n\nwas never presented to the jury, I cannot join in upholding her\n\nconviction as to the other two counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                -51-\n\f",

She    and     two   co-defendants,     Félix\n\nGabriel Castro-Davis (\"Gabriel\") and Félix Alberto Castro-Davis\n\n(\"Alberto\"), appealed their convictions on a number of grounds,\n\nincluding sufficiency of the evidence.              In a separate opinion, we\n\naffirmed the convictions of Alberto and Gabriel. See United States\n\nv. Castro-Davis, Nos. 08-2108, 08-2109. In this opinion, we affirm\n\nNeliza's carjacking and conspiracy convictions and reverse her\n\nfirearm conviction.1\n\n                                      I.\n\n              The underlying facts are set forth in detail in the\n\ncompanion opinion, United States v. Castro-Davis, Nos. 08-2108, 08-\n\n2109.     As we explained there, the jury could have found from the\n\nevidence presented at trial that Gabriel and Alberto carjacked\n\nHéctor Pérez-Torres on the afternoon of July 15, 2006 in Caguas,\n\nPuerto Rico.          There was no evidence presented regarding what\n\n\n\n      1\n          Judge Torruella dissents from the affirmance of the\ncarjacking and conspiracy convictions. Also, in a section of this\nopinion not joined by Judge Baldock (Part II.C), I explain my\nreservations about the precedents that require, in my view,\naffirming the carjacking conviction, and urge en banc review to re-\nexamine them.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fhappened in the immediate aftermath of the carjacking.            Later that\n\nevening, Gabriel and Alberto arrived at Neliza's parents' house in\n\nCayey with Pérez handcuffed inside his own car.            Gabriel had been\n\nliving at the house with Neliza, whom he was dating at the time.\n\nAlthough Neliza did not arrive with Gabriel and Alberto, she placed\n\na phone call at that time to her brother José, who was inside the\n\nhouse, and asked him to step outside to speak with Gabriel.              When\n\nJosé went outside, Gabriel offered him money to guard Pérez for a\n\nwhile. José agreed, and Gabriel and Alberto left to withdraw money\n\nusing Pérez's ATM card.\n\n           While   watching    Pérez,     José   grew   nervous   and   called\n\nGabriel to urge him to hurry.             Neliza answered the phone and\n\nassured him they were nearby.2      Just after the conversation ended,\n\nhowever, Pérez jumped from the car and attempted to escape.              José\n\nunsuccessfully tried to force him back into the car, and a struggle\n\nensued until Gabriel, Alberto, and Neliza arrived and subdued\n\nPérez.   In the meantime, several neighbors approached the house to\n\ninquire about the noise.      Neliza told them not to get involved, and\n\nshe and Gabriel closed a gate to prevent them from approaching.\n\n           José went to a gas station after the fight to wash his\n\ncar and drink a beer.      Gabriel, Alberto, and Neliza followed to\n\ncheck on him.   Neliza was driving her own car, Gabriel was driving\n\n\n\n     2\n          It is unclear whether Neliza answered Gabriel's phone or\nwhether José accidentally called his sister's phone.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fPérez's car, and Alberto was sitting in Pérez's car holding Pérez\n\nin a headlock.      The three spoke briefly with José and then drove\n\noff in the same direction.\n\n           The next day, Neliza and Gabriel met José at the house.\n\nGabriel explained that he and Alberto had killed Pérez the night\n\nbefore by asphyxiating him with duct tape.3           Gabriel and Neliza\n\ninstructed José to threaten the neighbors and tell them to remain\n\nsilent about the previous day's events.\n\n           The following year, Gabriel, Alberto, and Neliza were\n\ncharged with aiding and abetting a carjacking that resulted in\n\ndeath, 18 U.S.C. § 2119(3); conspiring to commit that carjacking,\n\n18 U.S.C. §§ 371; and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm\n\nduring the carjacking, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). After a four-\n\nday trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.\n\nThe district court sentenced Neliza to a total term of imprisonment\n\nof   262   months   and   sentenced   Gabriel   and    Alberto   to   life\n\nimprisonment.    This appeal followed.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           On appeal, Neliza challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence supporting her convictions and claims that the district\n\ncourt made a number of evidentiary and procedural errors that\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          The government has not alleged that Neliza was directly\ninvolved in the killing of Pérez.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fentitle her to a new trial.

She claims that her involvement, if any, with Alberto and\n\nGabriel's criminal scheme began long after those two had seized\n\nPérez's car.        In her view, there was no basis for the jury to\n\nconclude that she aided and abetted the carjacking because it is\n\nnot possible to aid and abet a crime that has already been\n\ncommitted.4\n\n              The basic legal premise of her argument -- that she\n\ncannot be convicted of aiding and abetting a completed crime -- is\n\nsound.       At common law, participants in a felony were divided into\n\n\n\n       4\n          Neliza also suggests in passing that she did not have the\nrequisite intent to commit the carjacking.

Like many crimes, carjacking is composed of\n\nseveral different types of elements: the offense conduct (the\n\ntaking of a motor vehicle from the person or presence of another by\n\nforce and violence or by intimidation), a mental state (the intent\n\nto cause death or serious bodily harm), an attendant circumstance\n\n(the       transportation     of   the    vehicle   in   interstate   or    foreign\n\ncommerce), and, for aggravated carjacking, a consequence (serious\n\nbodily injury or death).5                For purposes of aiding and abetting\n\nliability, it is the duration of the offense conduct that matters,\n\nsince the aiding and abetting statute \"states a rule of criminal\n\nresponsibility for acts which one assists another in performing.\"\n\nNye & Nissen v.

The first sign of Neliza's involvement in\n\nthe criminal episode was a phone call she made to her brother José\n\non the evening of July 15, 2006, asking him to step outside the\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          Although the current aiding and abetting statute obscures\nthis point by speaking in terms of aiding the commission of an\n\"offense,\" the focus on offense conduct was explicit in the former\nversion of the statute, which provided: \"Whoever directly commits\nany act constituting an offense defined in any law of the United\nStates, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures\nits commission, is a principal.\" 18 U.S.C. § 550 (1940) (emphasis\nadded). The current language was substituted as part of the 1948\nre-codification of Title 18.    It is apparent from the Revision\nNotes that the change was intended to be stylistic only. See 18\nU.S.C. § 2, Revision Notes (\"Section 2(a) comprises § 550 of Title\n18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., without change except in minor matters of\nphraseology.\").\n\n                                      -8-\n\fhouse to speak with Gabriel.7     But the seizure of the vehicle\n\noccurred several hours earlier, in the mid- to late-afternoon.\n\nThere was no evidence suggesting what Neliza might have been doing\n\nat the time of the seizure or when she became entangled in the\n\ncarjacking scheme.   The government attempted to fill this gap at\n\ntrial by arguing that \"somebody\" must have driven Alberto and\n\nGabriel from Cayey to the scene of the carjacking in Caguas: \"They\n\ndidn't walk from Cayey to Salchichón in Caguas. Somebody took them\n\nthere, and that someone is Neliza Figueroa-Cartagena.\"8     But the\n\ngovernment presented no evidence to support that theory.   Needless\n\nto say, Alberto and Gabriel could have arrived in Caguas in any\n\nnumber of ways, and they may have sought Neliza's aid after they\n\nseized the car.   The government's theory is pure conjecture, which\n\ncannot form the basis for a criminal conviction.9   United States v.\n\nSpinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196301\"><a href=\"/opinion/196301/united-states-v-spinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 234 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          The precise time is a matter of dispute. José testified\nthat it was \"getting dark\" when Neliza called, which he estimated\nwas around 6:00 p.m. It was later pointed out that the sun sets\nsignificantly later than 6:00 p.m. during the summer in Puerto\nRico. The exact time is not critical for present purposes.\n     8\n          As we explain more fully in Part II.B, infra, this was\nnot the government's only factual argument about Neliza's\ninvolvement.\n     9\n          Indeed, the government has made little effort to defend\nthis theory on appeal, choosing instead to obscure the distinctions\namong the defendants by referring to them generically as\n\"appellants.\"\n\n                                -9-\n\f              It would seem to follow that Neliza's conviction cannot\n\nstand because there is insufficient evidence that she participated\n\nin the carjacking offense conduct.           But that conclusion rests on a\n\nthird, unstated assumption: that the offense conduct for carjacking\n\nbegins and ends when the vehicle is first seized.           In our circuit,\n\nat least, that is not the law.        We have held that when a carjacking\n\nvictim is taken hostage, \"the commission of [the] carjacking\n\ncontinues at least while the carjacker maintains control over the\n\nvictim and [his or] her car.\"         Ramírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d at 30 n.9;\n\naccord United States v.

The Dissent\n\n            The dissent argues that it is a due process violation to\n\naffirm Neliza's conviction based on her conduct at the Figueroa\n\nhouse.     We respectfully disagree.   It is true that \"we cannot\n\naffirm a criminal conviction on the basis of a theory not presented\n\nto the jury . . . .\" Chiarella v.

But that is not a problem here because the jury was\n\nspecifically invited to consider Neliza's conduct at the house.\n\nThe government argued in closing that Neliza should be convicted as\n\nan aider and abettor of the carjacking offense based in part on\n\nthat conduct, including her phone call to José and her intervention\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fwith   the     neighbors.     Neliza's    counsel   directly   engaged   the\n\ngovernment's argument in her own closing argument, questioning\n\nwhether José's account of Neliza's involvement at the house was\n\nreliable. Thus, the whole range of Neliza's conduct was put before\n\nthe jury.      It is of no moment that the government's case rested in\n\npart on an unsupported factual assertion (i.e., that Neliza drove\n\nAlberto and Gabriel to the site where they first seized Pérez's\n\nvehicle).       As the dissent acknowledges, we cannot overturn the\n\nverdict because it might have been based on a factually unsupported\n\ntheory.      See Santellan v.

The indictment was framed in general terms that tracked\n\nthe language of the carjacking statute, and the jury instruction on\n\ncarjacking repeated that same language.             See 18 U.S.C. § 2119\n\n(\"Whoever, with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm\n\ntakes a motor vehicle that has been transported, shipped, or\n\nreceived in interstate or foreign commerce from the person or\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fpresence    of     another      by      force      and    violence       or      by\n\nintimidation . . . .\"). The instruction on aiding and abetting, in\n\nturn, was broadly worded and suggested that the entire course of\n\nNeliza's conduct could be considered.              For example, the jury was\n\ninstructed that \"[a] particular defendant, to be responsible under\n\naiding and abetting, need not perform the underlying criminal act,\n\nbe present when it was performed, or be aware of all the details of\n\nthe execution to be guilty of aiding and abetting.\" The government\n\nemphasized that point in its closing argument by listing all of\n\nNeliza's conduct and asserting: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, that is\n\ncalled aiding and abetting.       She didn't have to put the tape around\n\n[Pérez's] face.    She helped them.         She aided and abetted them.         She\n\nknew what they were doing.        She was standing to benefit from it,\n\nand she is just as responsible under the law as they are.\"\n\n           Under the circumstances, even in the absence of an\n\nexplicit   jury    instruction       that    the   offense     conduct   of     the\n\ncarjacking charge continued while Pérez was held hostage in the\n\ncar, the jury was presented with the theory that Neliza could be\n\nconvicted of carjacking based on her conduct at the house.                   Neliza\n\nhad ample opportunity to rebut the factual and legal basis for that\n\ntheory.    Ultimately,     however,     the     jury   chose   to    believe    the\n\ngovernment's     version   of   the   facts.       Affirming    on    that    basis\n\ntherefore does not infringe Neliza's \"right to be heard on the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fspecific charges of which [s]he is accused.\"       Dunn v.

Reconsidering the Abduction Rule11\n\n           Although I disagree with the dissent's argument that\n\nNeliza's carjacking conviction cannot be affirmed under our current\n\ncarjacking jurisprudence, I must acknowledge my reservations about\n\nthe correctness of that jurisprudence. The notion that the offense\n\nconduct for carjacking continues \"while the carjacker maintains\n\ncontrol over the victim and his or her car\" is essential to the\n\nholding that Neliza was properly convicted as an aider and abettor.\n\nThat construction of the carjacking statute, which I will refer to\n\nas the abduction rule, has been repeated in numerous cases in this\n\n\n\n      10\n          The dissent also raises the separate point that the\ngovernment has not fully developed on appeal the argument that\nNeliza's conviction can be affirmed based on her conduct at the\nhouse. We acknowledge that the government's briefing is rather\nunhelpful in that regard and that we could perhaps deem the\nargument to be abandoned or forfeited. See United States v. Vega\nMolina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201589\"><a href=\"/opinion/201589/united-states-v-vega-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Under the circumstances\nof this case, we choose not to do the government's homework.\").\nBut potential forfeitures arising out of poor appellate briefing\ncan be excused under appropriate circumstances. See Charles A.\nWright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure: Jurisdiction § 3974.1\n(4th ed. 2008). The government has invoked the relevant principles\nand cases, albeit in connection with the intent element rather than\nthe offense conduct element. We will not reverse what is otherwise\na valid conviction because the government has done a poor job of\nwriting its brief.\n      11\n          As already noted, Judge Baldock does not join me in this\nportion of the opinion.    Therefore, I must resort to the first\nperson in describing my views. However, as Judge Torruella makes\nclear in his separate opinion, he agrees with most of the analysis\nhere.\n\n                                -14-\n\fcircuit and finds support in several cases from other circuits.12\n\nNevertheless, the basis for that interpretation has never been\n\nexplained   and    does   not   appear   to   be    firmly   grounded   in   the\n\nstatutory text or the relevant case law.              Although the panel is\n\nbound to apply the abduction rule here, I believe the issue would\n\nbenefit from review by the full court.             I explain my view.\n\n            1.

At the core of the crime of carjacking is the\n\nforcible \"taking\" of a motor vehicle \"from the person or presence\n\nof another.\"   \"Taking\" (or \"caption,\" as it was also called) is a\n\ncommon law term of art derived from the law of robbery and larceny.\n\nIt refers to the act of \"securing dominion\" over something.       3\n\nLaFave, supra, § 19.3(a); see also 3 Charles E. Torcia, Wharton's\n\nCriminal Law § 357 (15th ed. 2009) (\"There is a caption when the\n\ndefendant takes possession.   He takes possession when he exercises\n\ndominion and control over the property.\").    \"Taking\" was distinct\n\nfrom \"carrying away\" (or \"asportation\"), which was a separate\n\nelement and could not occur until after the property had been\n\n\"taken.\"   3 Torcia, supra, § 357.    Thus, at common law, a taking\n\nwas complete once the defendant had secured initial control over\n\nthe property in question.13\n\n\n     13\n          The scope of a taking was not simply an academic matter.\nBecause the use of force or fear had to coincide with the taking at\ncommon law, the narrow understanding of a taking significantly\nrestricted the scope of a robbery.      See William Blackstone, 4\nCommentaries * 242 (\"[I]f one privately steals sixpence from the\nperson of another, and afterwards keeps it by putting him in fear,\nthis is no robbery, for the fear is subsequent.\"); 4 Torcia, supra,\n§ 463 (\"At common law, . . . force or threatened force (putting a\nvictim in fear of injury) amounts to robbery only if it is used to\n'take' property from the possession of another.

See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 102-851, pt. 1, at 15 (1992) (\"In\n\n[an 'armed carjacking'], two or three criminals approach a car\n\nwaiting at a traffic light, or stopped by means of a deliberate\n\n'fender-bender' accident, and force the driver to turn over the\n\nkeys at gunpoint.\"); 138 Cong.

That\n\nstatute contains a separate provision to cover robbery/abductions:\n\n            Whoever, in committing any offense defined in\n            this section, or in avoiding or attempting to\n            avoid apprehension for the commission of such\n            offense, or in freeing himself or attempting\n            to free himself from arrest or confinement for\n            such offense, . . . forces any person to\n            accompany him without the consent of such\n            person, shall be imprisoned not less than ten\n            years, or if death results shall be punished\n            by death or life imprisonment.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2113(e).

First Circuit Precedent\n\n          The origins of the abduction rule in this circuit also\n\nraise doubts about its validity.       We developed the rule in two\n\ncases: Ramírez-Burgos v.

Ramírez-Burgos raised the issue of when a serious\n\nbodily injury \"results\" from a carjacking within the meaning of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119(2).    Lebrón-Cepeda raised the related issue of when\n\na killing is \"committed in the perpetration of\" a carjacking for\n\npurposes of the felony murder statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1111.15\n\n          We decided both cases on the assumption that, to be\n\npunishable, a serious bodily injury or killing must occur while the\n\noffense conduct is still continuing.      See Ramírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d\n\nat 30 (The term \"results\" includes \"injuries that were caused by\n\nthe actions of the carjacker at any time during the commission of\n\nthe carjacking.\"); Lebrón-Cepeda, 324 F.3d at 61 (\"Lebrón concedes\n\nthat the success of his challenge to the application of the\n\n[felony] murder cross reference depends on our finding that the\n\nkilling of Fontánez did not occur during the carjacking.\").      Both\n\ncases involved harms that occurred long after the vehicle had been\n\n\n     15\n          More precisely, Lebrón-Cepeda raised the issue in the\ncontext of the Sentencing Guidelines murder cross-reference, which\nis keyed to the murder statute. See USSG § 2B3.1(c) (\"If a victim\nwas killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under\n18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing taken place within the\nterritorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply\n§ 2A1.1 (First Degree Murder).\").\n\n                                -23-\n\fseized.    In explaining why those harms were properly considered in\n\npunishing the defendants, we expansively construed the carjacking\n\nstatute, holding that \"the commission of a carjacking continues at\n\nleast while the carjacker maintains control over the victim and her\n\ncar.\"     Ramírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d at 30 n.9.   We gave no further\n\nexplanation for that statement and cited a prior First Circuit case\n\nthat, on closer scrutiny, does not seem to provide the necessary\n\nsupport.    Id. (citing United States v. Vázquez-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197770\"><a href=\"/opinion/197770/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 178 (1st Cir. 1998)).16\n\n\n\n\n     16\n          In Vázquez-Rivera, we held that the \"if serious bodily\ninjury results\" provision is not limited to injuries that are\n\"'necessary to' or 'intended to effectuate' the taking of the\nvehicle itself.\" 135 F.3d at 178. Rather,\n\n     the choice of the word \"results\" . . . suggests that\n     Congress intended to cover a fairly broad range of\n     consequences flowing from a carjacking. Moreover, the\n     legislative history characterized the provision as\n     imposing the enhancement when the carjacking \"involves\n     bodily injury,\" which supports the view that the injuries\n     covered are not limited to those resulting from the\n     \"taking\" of a vehicle, but also include those caused by\n     the carjacker at any point during his or her retention of\n     the vehicle.\n\nId. (internal citation omitted). Although we suggested that our\ndiscussion implicated the \"temporal limits of the crime of\ncarjacking,\" it is clear that we were discussing the necessary\ncausal connection between the offense conduct and the resulting\nserious bodily injury. Id. But see Lebrón-Cepeda, 324 F.3d at 64\nn.4 (Howard, J., concurring) (recognizing that Vázquez-Rivera did\nnot \"explicitly\" state the abduction rule, but arguing that it\n\"implied as much when it held that a serious bodily injury\nsustained by a carjacking victim during a sexual assault that\nfollowed both the initial seizure of her vehicle and her kidnaping\n'result[ed]' from the carjacking\").\n\n                                 -24-\n\f              In retrospect, Ramírez-Burgos and Lebrón-Cepeda may have\n\nrested   on    an   erroneous   premise.   Cases   interpreting   similar\n\ncriminal statutes have not taken the view that an injury or killing\n\nmust happen while the offense conduct is still continuing to be\n\npunishable.\n\n              For example, of the many criminal statutes containing an\n\n\"if serious bodily injury results\" or \"if death results\" provision,\n\nI am not aware of any that have been interpreted to mean that the\n\noffense conduct must be technically ongoing at the time of the\n\ninjury or death.       Instead, the applicability of such provisions\n\nturns on a causation analysis.       See, e.g., United States v.

If the felony and the killing occur as part of the same\n\ncriminal transaction, the defendant will usually be liable for\n\nfelony murder.       See, e.g., State v.

Thus,   our    assumption    in    Lebrón-Cepeda      that    the\n\ndefendant's challenge could succeed only if we found that \"the\n\nkilling of [the victim] did not occur during the carjacking\" was\n\nprobably inaccurate.        324 F.3d at 61 (emphasis added).\n\n            In short, it may have been unnecessary for us to develop\n\nthe abduction rule in the first place.                   If we had applied a\n\ncausation analysis in Ramírez-Burgos and a transactional analysis\n\nin Lebrón-Cepeda, we would almost certainly have reached the same\n\nresult.     A rethinking of the abduction rule will not seriously\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fdisturb our settled precedent. Indeed, it would not affect Gabriel\n\nand    Alberto's     convictions   in    this   case.       They   were     properly\n\nconvicted as principals to the carjacking, and they can be held to\n\naccount for the \"result[ing]\" death of Pérez even if that death did\n\nnot occur until after the offense conduct had ended.\n\n             4.    Conclusion\n\n             All of these factors lead me to conclude that it is time\n\nto reconsider the abduction rule, which can lead to strange and\n\nseemingly arbitrary results.            In this case, Neliza is guilty of\n\ncarjacking simply because Gabriel and Alberto decided to keep Pérez\n\nin the car rather than abandon the car and hold Pérez captive in\n\nthe    house.      See   Ramírez-Burgos,       313   F.3d   at   30   n.9    (\"[T]he\n\ncommission of a carjacking continues at least while the carjacker\n\nmaintains control over the victim and her car.\") (emphasis added).\n\nMoreover, to the extent the question might be close, the rule of\n\nlenity and a presumption against continuing offenses17 might weigh\n\nin favor of a narrower interpretation of the carjacking statute.\n\n             The temporal scope of carjacking is likely to be a\n\nrecurring issue in this circuit.           It frequently arises in appeals\n\ninvolving the intent element of carjacking. See Lebrón-Cepeda, 324\n\nF.3d    at   62-66    (Howard,   J.,    concurring).

Conspiracy\n\n           Neliza's challenge to her conspiracy conviction also goes\n\nto the timing of the offense.       She argues that \"the evidence\n\npresented at trial failed to establish that she was a member of the\n\nconspiracy when the forcible taking of the vehicle occurred.\"19\n\nHowever, conspiracy, like carjacking in this circuit, is often a\n\ncontinuing offense. Muñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d at 55 n.32. As alleged\n\nin the indictment and implicitly found by the jury, the conspiracy\n\nin this case continued at least while Pérez was held hostage.   See\n\nPapa, 555 F.3d at 36 n.3 (\"[A] conspiracy generally ends when the\n\ndesign to commit substantive misconduct ends . . . .\") (quoting\n\n\n\n     18\n          In questioning the validity of Neliza's carjacking\nconviction, I do not in any way minimize the seriousness of her\nalleged conduct. She could certainly have been held to answer for\nthat conduct under the laws of Puerto Rico, and she might have been\ncharged federally as an accessory after the fact like her brother\nJosé, see 18 U.S.C. § 3.\n     19\n          She also suggests in passing that she did not have the\nnecessary intent.

The evidence of her\n\nlater involvement provided a sufficient basis for the jury to infer\n\nthat she knew of Alberto and Gabriel's plan, shared their common\n\npurpose, and acted to further that plan or purpose.           No more was\n\nneeded to sustain her conviction.\n\nE.   Firearm Count\n\n           Neliza's final sufficiency of the evidence argument goes\n\nto her conviction on the firearm count.

As we\n\nhave said, there is no evidence that Neliza was involved in the\n\ninitial seizure of the car. Moreover, while there is evidence that\n\nAlberto carried a firearm throughout the entire episode, there is\n\nno evidence that Neliza was aware of the firearm or that she took\n\nany   steps    to    facilitate       the    carrying     of   the   firearm.

Evid. 804(b)(3).      Neliza\nchallenges that ruling on appeal, arguing that nothing in the phone\nconversation was against her (Neliza's) penal interest. That is\nnot the relevant inquiry, however. Rule 804(b)(3) requires the\ndistrict court to ask whether the statement at issue \"so far tended\nto subject the declarant\" -- in this case, Alberto -- \"to . . .\ncriminal liability . . . that a reasonable person in the\ndeclarant's position would not have made the statement unless\nbelieving it to be true.\" Id. (emphasis added). Neliza makes no\nargument on that issue, and we decline to address it without the\nbenefit of briefing.\n\n                                          -34-\n\fB.   Gabriel's Statement\n\n           Neliza also raises a Confrontation Clause challenge with\n\nrespect to the trial testimony of FBI agent Eric Gonima.                In his\n\ntestimony, Gonima recounted the details of a post-arrest interview\n\nhe conducted with Gabriel. Gabriel denied all involvement with the\n\ncarjacking and killing of Pérez in the interview.                 He briefly\n\nmentioned Neliza, acknowledging that she had been his girlfriend\n\nand that he knew her family, though \"not very well.\"            Neliza argues\n\nthat it was erroneous for the district court to admit the testimony\n\nwithout instructing the jury that Gabriel's statement could not be\n\nconsidered as evidence against her.          See Richardson, 481 U.S. at\n\n211.   Because she objected at trial, we review her claim de novo.\n\nUnited States v.

We would ordinarily ask at this point\n\nwhether the statement was \"inculpatory on its face\" with respect to\n\nNeliza.   Id. at 520.      There is no need to undertake that inquiry\n\nhere, however, because the government concedes that even if the\n\nstatement was admissible, it was error to admit it without a\n\nlimiting instruction.       See id. at 521 (\"Supreme Court case law\n\nmakes clear that the trial court ordinarily should instruct the\n\njury that one defendant's out-of-court confession may not be used\n\nagainst his codefendants in a joint trial.\").\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\f           Nevertheless, the government says, the district court's\n\nerror was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.       We agree.   The only\n\nfact about Neliza that was directly or indirectly revealed through\n\nGabriel's statement was the existence of her relationship with\n\nGabriel.    But   that   relationship   was   already   well-established\n\nthrough José's testimony and the testimony of neighbors. Gabriel's\n\nstatement added no new information in that regard.         Any error in\n\nadmitting the statement without a limiting instruction was harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nC.   Peremptory Challenges\n\n           Neliza criticizes the district court's procedure for\n\nexercising peremptory challenges at voir dire. Because she did not\n\nmake a contemporaneous objection, we review for plain error.\n\n           Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24 sets forth the\n\nnumber of regular peremptory challenges that the parties may\n\nexercise and grants them several \"additional\" challenges that \"may\n\nbe used only to remove alternate jurors.\"       We have interpreted the\n\nrule to mean that the district court must designate particular\n\nmembers of the venire as prospective alternate jurors and must\n\nlimit the parties' additional challenges to that group. See United\n\nStates v. González-Meléndez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1379893\"><a href=\"/opinion/1379893/united-states-v-gonzalez-melendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (1st Cir. 2010).       The\n\ndistrict court failed to follow that procedure in this case.\n\nRather than separating the parties' regular strikes from their\n\nadditional strikes, it required the parties to exercise all of\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\ftheir    strikes   at   once    against   an   undifferentiated   panel   of\n\nprospective jurors.      That was error, as the government concedes.\n\n            Nevertheless, Neliza has not shown that the error was\n\nprejudicial.    See United States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735 (1993)\n\n(plain error standard generally requires the defendant to show that\n\nthe     error   \"affected      the   outcome    of   the   district   court\n\nproceedings\").

It\n            is not evident that the composition of the\n            jury would have differed had the district\n            court adhered to Rule 24(c)(4).      Moreover,\n            even if a different venire member would have\n            been selected as the alternate juror, there is\n            no basis in the record for concluding that the\n            alteration   in   jury  composition   had   an\n            injurious    influence    on   the    verdict.\n            Therefore, we conclude that the court's error\n            was harmless.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\f594 F.3d at 34.   As in González-Meléndez, there is no evidence here\n\nthat the district court's error injuriously affected the outcome of\n\nthe proceedings.24\n\nD.   Jury Note\n\n           Neliza's final procedural claim relates to a note sent by\n\nthe jury during deliberations.    The note, which was made part of\n\nthe record, stated that the jury would like to \"hear again the\n\nphone conversation between [Alberto] and his mother.\" The district\n\ncourt's minute entry from that day indicates that the note was\n\n\"received and discussed with counsel,\" but there is no indication\n\nwhat action, if any, was taken in response.    The trial transcript\n\ncontains no record of any proceedings involving the jury note.\n\n           Neliza argues that she was never informed of the note.\n\nAlthough the minute entry contradicts her assertion, she has\n\nincluded in the addendum to her brief an e-mail in which her trial\n\ncounsel denies any knowledge about how the note was handled.     We\n\ndecline Neliza's invitation to delve into this dispute on the basis\n\nof unsworn evidence that was never presented to the district court.\n\nThere are various avenues available to a party who seeks to remedy\n\na perceived omission or misstatement in the record.     See Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 10(c), (e); 16A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal\n\n\n\n     24\n          This conclusion does not lessen our concern about the\ndistrict court's violation of the rule applicable to the selection\nof alternate jurors.   In the future, the district court should\nscrupulously comply with Rule 24.\n\n                                 -38-\n\fPractice & Procedure § 3956.4 (3d ed. 1999 & Supp. 2008).            But\n\ninserting new evidence into the addendum of a brief is not one of\n\nthose avenues.    The e-mail is stricken from the record, and we\n\ndisregard Neliza's argument because it depends on the improperly\n\nincluded material.     See Nicholson v.

Alberto,\n\nGabriel, and Neliza were indicted on the same charges and tried\n\njointly.25    There was enough direct and circumstantial evidence\n\npresented to the jury to permit it to find that Alberto and Gabriel\n\ntook Pérez's car from his person by violence or intimidation, with\n\nthe aid of a firearm, and that sometime after this \"physical\n\ntaking\"   they    brought       Pérez   and    his    car   to   José's   house   for\n\nsafekeeping.26      See Castro-Davis, Nos. 08-2108, 08-2109.                      The\n\nevidence as to Neliza's involvement on the other hand, was not so\n\nclear.    I agree with the majority that there was no evidence\n\npresented that would allow a jury to make a reasonable inference\n\nthat Neliza was involved in the planning stages of the carjacking,\n\n\n     25\n      Count I of the indictment charged defendants under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 371 (conspiracy to commit carjacking), Count II under 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 2119(3) and 2 (aiding and abetting a carjacking resulting in\ndeath), and Count III under 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 2\n(using or carrying a firearm in connection with a carjacking).\n     26\n      I will refer to \"physical taking\" as the time period during\nwhich the carjacker obtains possession of a motor vehicle while in\nthe presence of another.    In the present case, that \"physical\ntaking\" ended once Pérez and his car were captured by the\ncarjackers and one of them began to drive it.\n\n                                        -40-\n\for that she was involved at the \"physical taking\" of the car from\n\nPérez's person.       See Maj. Op. at 9.\n\n            The evidence at trial instead showed that Neliza first\n\nbecame involved when she called her brother, José, and told him to\n\nstep outside his home to receive Gabriel.                  That phone call,\n\nhowever, did not establish that Neliza knew anything about the\n\ncarjacking.     José testified that soon after receiving the call, he\n\nstepped outside to meet Gabriel.             His testimony was completely\n\ndevoid of any mention of Neliza.           Conspicuously absent from the\n\nrecord    was   any   inquiry   from   the    government    as   to   Neliza's\n\nwhereabouts at this point in José's testimony.27            As the majority\n\nopinion makes clear, the first time there was any evidence that\n\nNeliza learned of the carjacking was many hours after the \"physical\n\ntaking\" of Pérez and his car.28\n\n\n     27\n       A reading of the trial transcript evinces copious use of the\nword \"they\" by both the prosecution and witnesses, with no attempt\nmade to clarify whether \"they\" referred to Alberto, Gabriel and\nNeliza; Alberto and Gabriel; or some other combination of the\nthree.    In fact, when José testifies that Gabriel and Alberto\nbrought Pérez to the house, the prosecutor does not ask whether\nNeliza (who José had testified had called him to come out of his\nhouse to receive Gabriel) also came with Alberto and Gabriel.\nInstead, the prosecutor next asks José: \"Okay. So you were told\nthat Gabby and whoever were going to an ATM machine . . . .\"\n(emphasis added). As the majority points out, the government seems\nto have chosen the same strategy on this appeal, referring to\nappellants generically as \"appellants\" and not individually. Maj.\nOp. at 9 n.7.\n     28\n      All the evidence points to the \"physical taking\" taking place\nin the early hours of the afternoon. José testified that it was\n\"getting dark\" when Neliza called.     The official record of the\nAstronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Navy indicates\n\n                                   -41-\n\f          As the majority well-states the law, a person cannot be\n\nfound guilty of aiding and abetting a crime that already has been\n\ncommitted.

Since Neliza's\n\ninvolvement could only be found by a reasonable jury after the\n\n\"physical taking\" of Pérez and his car took place, her conviction\n\nmust be overturned unless the offense of carjacking continued until\n\nthe time when Neliza first became involved.      The majority holds\n\nthat the law of this circuit is such that the offense conduct of\n\ncarjacking in this case was still ongoing after the \"physical\n\ntaking\" since Alberto and Gabriel remained in control of the victim\n\nPérez and his car.

See Ramírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d at 30.          In my view, this is a\n\nmisreading of the statute.         As the majority explains, the word\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\f\"results\" merely indicates a causal connection, one not necessarily\n\ncircumscribed     by    the   time   when   the   offense   conduct   of   the\n\ncarjacking ends.       As an example, it seems clear that if a defendant\n\ntook a car, shot the victim in the process, and abandoned the car\n\nan hour later, we would not say the crime was ongoing over the\n\ncourse of the three weeks it took for the victim to languish in the\n\nhospital and die.       It also seems clear that in that situation, the\n\ncarjacker could be convicted under the plain language of § 2119(3).\n\nHowever, under our current abduction rule, he might not be.\n\n             Finally, and as relevant later, I do not see where the\n\nabduction rule is in any way supported by the plain language of the\n\nstatute,29 whether by a plain and commonsensical definition of the\n\nword \"take\" -- \"to get into one's hands or into one's possession,\n\npower or control by force or stratagem\"30 -- or as derived from the\n\ncommon law of robbery and larceny.          It is not apparent to me why a\n\nreasonable person would read the carjacking statute and believe\n\n\n     29\n          18 U.S.C. § 2119(3) reads:\n\n     Whoever with the intent to cause death or serious bodily\n     harm takes a motor vehicle that has been transported,\n     shipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce\n     from the person or presence of another by force and\n     violence or by intimidation, or attempts to do so, shall\n     . . . if death results, be fined under this title or\n     imprisoned, any number of years up to life, or both, or\n     sentenced to death.\n\n(emphasis added).\n     30\n      Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged 2329\n(1976).\n\n                                     -44-\n\fthat the \"taking\" of a car under the statute continues while the\n\ncarjacker maintains control over the victim and his or her car.   I\n\nsimply do not see how a reasonable person would assume that\n\n\"tak[ing] a motor vehicle . . . from the person or presence of\n\nanother by force and violence or by intimidation,\" § 2119(3), is an\n\nact that continues past the moment when the carjacker has obtained\n\n(i.e., already taken) clear possession (in this case, sometime\n\nbefore Alberto and Gabriel arrived at José's house).\n\n          While I concur with the majority's analysis of our\n\ncurrent law and join in calling for the en banc court to correct\n\nthis error promptly, I nevertheless cannot join their conclusion.31\n\nAlthough it may well be the law of our circuit, the abduction rule\n\ntheory was never presented to the jury as a basis of conviction.\n\nIndeed, the jury was told they could convict on the basis of what\n\nthe majority calls \"pure conjecture.\"     See Chiarella v.

The jury was never told that Neliza could be legally\n\nconvicted even if the jury found that she first learned of the\n\ncarjacking after the \"physical taking\" had occurred, while Alberto\n\nand Gabriel maintained control over Pérez and his car.         See\n\nRamírez-Burgos, 313 F.3d at 30 n.9.   Significantly, the government\n\nnever argued the \"abduction rule\" as the law of the circuit,\n\nneither at trial nor in its appellate brief.32        Instead, the\n\ngovernment asked the jury to infer from the evidence presented that\n\nNeliza was involved in the \"physical taking\" of the carjacking, or\n\npossibly even before it, and that she must have known there was a\n\ngun being used on Pérez.   The majority finds correctly that this\n\n\n\n     32\n      Indeed, the government's appellate brief cites most of the\ncases the majority discusses as setting out the abduction rule, but\nit cites them for the issue of whether sufficient evidence was\npresented as to the conditional intent to cause serious bodily harm\nor death. See Gov't Brief at 21-23. Naturally, Neliza also did\nnot raise this theory at trial or on appeal.\n\n                               -46-\n\ftheory was \"pure conjecture\" and that there was not sufficient\n\nevidence for a reasonable jury to convict Neliza based on this\n\ntheory.   See Maj. Op. at 9.\n\n            The instructions given to the jury were also unclear as\n\nto the temporal bounds of the offense conduct of carjacking, never\n\nspecifying that the offense conduct included the time after the\n\n\"physical taking\" and that as such, Neliza could be convicted if\n\nthe jury found she was involved after Pérez and his car arrived to\n\nJosé's house.       Specifically, the jury was instructed that they\n\nshould convict if they found that the defendants either conspired\n\nor aided and abetted each other in \"taking Mr. Pérez's Mazda by\n\nforce and intimidation with intent to cause death and serious\n\nbodily harm by force, violence, and intimidation, and actually\n\nresulting in death.\"     The instructions were not improper as to the\n\nelements,    they   essentially   mirrored   the   carjacking   statute.\n\nHowever, they did not clarify what those elements meant.            The\n\ninstructions left up to the mind of the jury to define \"taking\" in\n\nwhat I view as an unsupportable extension -- that is, as including\n\nthe conduct of defendants after they arrived at José's house.        By\n\nnot defining our case law on the subject of carjacking and not\n\nspecifying that the act of carjacking in this case would legally\n\ncontinue up until the moment that the carjackers lost control of\n\nthe victim or his car, and because this is by no means an obvious\n\nor natural interpretation of the instructions, the only inference\n\n\n                                  -47-\n\fwe have left is that the jury convicted Neliza on the government's\n\ntheory at trial which the majority now finds to be insufficient to\n\nsustain her conviction.\n\n          \"The Supreme Court has ruled that where a jury is given\n\nthe option of choosing between factually adequate and factually\n\ninadequate theories of guilt, jurors 'are well equipped to analyze\n\nthe evidence' and can be counted upon to base their verdict upon\n\nthe factually adequate theory.\"       Santellan v.

That a jury\n\nmight have \"divined [this] theory from the facts\" and from the law\n\nas read to them in the jury instructions is not sufficient.        Cola,\n\n787 F.2d at 699 n.19.     \"The problem with th[at] view . . . is the\n\nserious risk involved that the jury did not so divine the appellate\n\ntheory, and instead, that it convicted based on the erroneous or\n\nnoncriminal   theories    before   it.\"    Id.   Barring   any   kind    of\n\nexplanation as to the law of our circuit explaining the abduction\n\nrule, I simply do not see how a jury might have divined it.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -48-\n\f             I view this case as analogous to the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Chiarella.          </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110221\"><a href=\"/opinion/110221/chiarella-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.     In that case, the employer\n\nof a financial printer engaged to print corporate takeover bids was\n\nconvicted based on his purchase of stock in target companies\n\nwithout informing its shareholders of his knowledge of proposed\n\ntakeovers.    Id. at 224-25.       The Supreme Court held that his conduct\n\ndid not violate the Securities Exchange Act and thus his conviction\n\nwas improper.       Id. at 224-35.        In its brief to the Court, the\n\ngovernment for the first time offered an alternative theory to\n\nsupport the conviction, arguing that petitioner's conviction could\n\nbe affirmed on the basis that he owed a duty to the corporation\n\nthat had hired the printing company.             Id.   at 235.33      The Supreme\n\nCourt reaffirmed the maxim that \"we cannot affirm a criminal\n\nconviction on the basis of a theory not presented to the jury,\" and\n\nheld that the jury instructions and the government's theory at\n\ntrial     showed   that   the    jury   had    convicted   on   the    theory   of\n\npetitioner's failure to disclose to shareholders, and not on a duty\n\nowed to anyone else.       Id. at 236.\n\n             Similarly in our previous decision in Cola, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468092\"><a href=\"/opinion/468092/neil-r-cola-v-charles-h-reardon-sheriff-of-essex-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\nwe granted habeas because the defendant had no notice at trial of\n\nthe theory which was eventually used by the state appeals court to\n\nuphold his conviction.          Citing to Dunn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110090\"><a href=\"/opinion/110090/dunn-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and granting\n\n\n\n     33\n      I note that the government in this case has not brought up\nthe abduction rule at any point in these proceedings.\n\n                                        -49-\n\fhabeas, we worried about the \"sixth amendment problems of whether\n\ndefendants   have   ever   been   presented   with   an   opportunity   to\n\nconfront, in a fact-finding forum, the government's final theory of\n\nguilt\" and noted that it was \"not clear whether an opportunity has\n\nbeen provided to have guilt determined by a jury in the first\n\ninstance [on that theory].\"       Cola, 787 F.2d at 701.    Just like in\n\nDunn, our court found that \"the prosecution in Cola's trial did not\n\nbuild its case on the evidence supporting the appellate theory,\"\n\nand rejected the assumption \"that the jury would somehow divine,\n\nand independently articulate, the appellate theory.\"         Id. at 700;\n\nDunn, 442 U.S. at 106 (\"[W]hile there was no variance between the\n\nindictment and proof at trial, there was a discrepancy between the\n\nbasis on which the jury rendered its verdict and that on which the\n\nCourt of Appeals sustained petitioner's conviction.\").\n\n          That there was evidence presented sufficient to convict\n\nNeliza as an accessory after the fact under 18 U.S.C. § 3, there is\n\nno doubt in my mind.34      However, the government did not charge\n\nNeliza as an accessory after the fact.        Neliza was charged in the\n\nsame way as Alberto and Gabriel: as an aider and abettor and\n\nconspirator to carjacking and to carrying a firearm during a\n\ncarjacking. The firearm charge proved to be patently baseless, and\n\n\n\n     34\n      Neliza can also be properly charged in the Commonwealth\ncourts for the various state crimes which, if proven by proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, could very well result in her conviction\nfor several serious felony offenses.\n\n                                   -50-\n\fa directed verdict should have been entered by the district court\n\nupon Neliza's Rule 50 motion.    We correct that error now and I\n\nfully join the majority in its decision as to that charge.    But\n\nbecause the majority upholds Neliza's conviction on a theory which\n\nwas never presented to the jury, I cannot join in upholding her\n\nconviction as to the other two counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                -51-\n\f</pre>",
