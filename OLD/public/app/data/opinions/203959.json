Mary    Wangui    Warui,    of    Kenya,\n\npetitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\ndenial of her motion to reopen.                   The BIA denied her motion to\n\nreopen and remand her case for further consideration of her claims\n\nfor withholding of removal and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (\"CAT\").            We deny the petition in part and dismiss\n\nit in part.\n\n                                           I.\n\n              Warui entered the United States from Kenya on November\n\n30, 2001 as a visitor, authorized to remain in the country until\n\nMay 29, 2002.       She overstayed.       On October 14, 2004, the Department\n\nof   Homeland       Security    filed      a    Notice     to     Appear    (\"NTA\")   in\n\nImmigration Court, initiating removal proceedings against Warui.\n\n              Her husband, Leonard Karioki, also a native and citizen\n\nof Kenya, entered the United States on April 6, 2004 and overstayed\n\nhis visa. He was placed in separate removal proceedings around the\n\nsame   time    as    Warui.         On   January    7,     2005,    Warui    sought   to\n\nconsolidate her case with that of her husband, admitting certain\n\nallegations in the NTA and conceding removability.                     The cases were\n\nsubsequently consolidated.\n\n              On    March     10,    2005,       Karioki    applied        for    asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.                        As part of\n\nhis application, he sought derivative asylum relief for Warui as\n\nhis spouse.         Warui was ineligible for asylum in her own right\n\n                                           -2-\n\fbecause she had not filed a timely application.   Warui did not make\n\nindependent claims for withholding of removal and CAT protection.\n\n           At a merits hearing held on May 8, 2006, Warui and\n\nKarioki both testified in support of their claims.         In their\n\ntestimony, they expressed fear that if they were removed to Kenya\n\nWarui would be forced to undergo female genital mutilation (\"FGM\")\n\nby a group called the Mungiki.\n\n           In his oral decision, the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") first\n\nfound that Karioki and Warui did not testify credibly, based on\n\ninconsistencies in their testimony.     Even assuming the two had\n\ntestified credibly, the IJ found Karioki's and Warui's testimony\n\nstill insufficient to meet their burden for asylum for several\n\nreasons.   First, the IJ found that Karioki and Warui had testified\n\nthey had been harassed by the Mungiki for nearly thirty years but\n\nthey had never been harmed, and so their fear of harm seemed\n\n\"implausible.\"   Second, the IJ found that they had failed to show\n\nthat the harm they feared was at the hands of a group which the\n\ngovernment was unable or unwilling to control, pointing to a State\n\nDepartment report showing that the Kenyan government had banned the\n\nMungiki and were trying to enforce the law against them.   Finally,\n\nthe IJ found the fear of future persecution inconsistent with the\n\nfact that Karioki and Warui's sons, who remained in Kenya, were\n\nmarried and their wives had not been forced to undergo FGM.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f           The IJ denied their claim for asylum.                He denied the\n\nwithholding of removal and CAT claims because these claims carry a\n\nhigher burden of proof than asylum and therefore Karioki and Warui\n\ncould not prove it more likely than not that they would undergo\n\npersecution or torture if returned.               The IJ granted voluntary\n\ndeparture to Warui but denied it to Karioki.\n\n           Karioki and Warui filed a timely appeal to the BIA.              On\n\nMay 28, 2008, the BIA denied them relief; it affirmed the IJ's\n\ndetermination with respect to lack of credibility and his alternate\n\nfindings with respect to denial of asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nand protection under the CAT.\n\n           Warui did not file a petition for review with this court.\n\nInstead, she filed a motion to reopen with the BIA on June 25,\n\n2008, seeking to apply individually for withholding of removal and\n\nprotection under the CAT.        In this motion, she informed the BIA\n\nthat she and her husband were divorced and that Karioki had\n\nreturned to Kenya.\n\n               On September 15, 2008, the BIA denied her motion.           The\n\nBIA first held that Warui had failed to present any material new\n\nfacts   that    could   be   proven   in    a   new   hearing   or   previously\n\nunavailable evidence.        Second, the BIA pointed out that Warui had\n\nfailed to challenge the IJ's adverse credibility finding with\n\nrespect to both her and her husband.            Based on this, the BIA could\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fnot \"conclude that any application for relief is now reasonably\n\nlikely to succeed on the merits in order to warrant reopening.\"\n\n                                 II.\n\n            In general, motions to reopen removal proceedings are\n\nnot favored because \"such motions are at odds with the compelling\n\npublic interests in finality and the expeditious processing of\n\nproceedings.\"     Beltre-Veloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting Guerrero-Santana v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 90, 92 (1st\n\nCir. 2007)).    We review denials by the BIA of motions to reopen for\n\nabuse of discretion.1    Kechichian v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 15, 22 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).     A decision by the BIA will survive review unless a\n\npetitioner can show that it \"committed an error of law or exercised\n\nits judgment in an arbitrary, capricious, or irrational way.\"    Id.\n\n(quoting Raza v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (1st Cir. 2007)).\n\n            A motion to reopen may only be granted if it states \"new\n\nfacts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is\n\ngranted.\"     8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).   Such a motion \"shall not be\n\ngranted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be\n\noffered is material and was not available and could not have been\n\ndiscovered or presented at the former hearing.\"    Id.   In addition,\n\n\"[a] motion to reopen must be denied unless petitioners' new\n\n\n\n     1\n          The parties have not argued that this court lacks\njurisdiction to consider the petition, cf. Oliveira v. Holder, 568\nF.3d 275, 277 n.4 (1st Cir. 2009), and we assume that we do have\njurisdiction.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fevidence   establishes       a    prima     facie      case    for   the    underlying\n\nsubstantive relief.\" Chikkeur v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 1381, 1383 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).\n\n           Warui's motion to reopen requested an opportunity to\n\npresent her own claims for withholding of removal and protection\n\nunder CAT.    It is not entirely clear from her briefs or from the\n\nBIA's and IJ's opinions whether her derivative asylum application\n\npurported to include \"derivative\" claims for withholding of removal\n\nand protection under CAT.               Unlike the statute governing asylum\n\napplications,     8    U.S.C.     §    1158,    the    statutes      and   regulations\n\ncovering   withholding       of       removal   and    the    CAT    do    not   contain\n\nprovisions for derivative claims, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R.\n\n§   1208.16(b),       (c).      This     circuit      has    explicitly     held    that\n\nderivative claims cannot be made for withholding of removal,\n\nKechichian, 535 F.3d at 22 n.4, and other circuits have held the\n\nsame with respect to the CAT, see, e.g., Martinez v. U.S. Att'y\n\nGen., No. 08-14398, 2009 WL 1109294, *3 (11th Cir. Apr. 27, 2009);\n\nOforji v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 609, 615 (7th Cir. 2003).                       We assume\n\nin her favor that Warui has only made a derivative claim for asylum\n\nand that withholding of removal and protection under CAT are the\n\nnew claims she seeks to submit through a motion to reopen.                          Even\n\nso, we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nthe motion to reopen to let her present those claims on her own\n\nbehalf.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f             As the BIA noted, Warui's motion did not state any new\n\nfacts material to her claims and it was not supported by any\n\npreviously unavailable evidence.           Her motion stated as \"new facts\"\n\nthat she and her husband had been divorced and that he had departed\n\nthe United States, but she did not argue that this changed the\n\nmaterial facts which had been presented in support of the original\n\nclaims for relief.     Rather, the motion simply requested the right\n\nto make her own application for withholding of removal and CAT\n\nprotection -- a claim that would have been based on the same facts\n\npreviously presented to the IJ.              Given that the standard for\n\nwithholding of removal places a higher burden on the applicant to\n\nprove past or future persecution, the BIA did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion to reopen the withholding of\n\nremoval claim.    Usman v. Holder, 566 F.3d 262, 268 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nOn   those   facts,   she   could    not    make   a   prima   facie   case   for\n\nwithholding of removal.\n\n             The same is true of Warui's CAT claim, which requires a\n\nfinding that she will \"more likely than not\" experience torture if\n\nremoved.     8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(4).         She does not claim to have\n\nalready suffered torture.           Since she could not meet the lower\n\nstandard of showing a well-founded fear she would suffer harm if\n\nremoved, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that she\n\ndid not present a prima facie case for relief under the CAT.\n\nUsman, 566 F.3d at 268.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          In her brief here, Warui makes a different argument. She\n\nargues that the BIA should reopen her case based on changed\n\ncircumstances, specifically that her case was \"in effect abandoned\"\n\nbecause of her divorce and Karioki's departure.     Yet, as the BIA\n\nfound, the material facts which underlie Warui's purported new\n\nclaims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT are\n\nthe same as those which led to denial of asylum.     On this basis,\n\nthe BIA's decision not to reopen was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n          Further, as the BIA pointed out, Warui's motion to reopen\n\nmade no challenge to the credibility findings made against her by\n\nthe IJ.   Warui now concedes that Karioki may not have testified\n\ncredibly and argues that she should be given an opportunity to\n\nestablish her own credibility.    Yet Warui availed herself of just\n\nsuch an opportunity in the original proceedings.    She testified at\n\nthe May 8, 2006 merits hearing, and the IJ and BIA reached their\n\ncredibility finding based on inconsistencies in her own testimony\n\nas well as those of her husband.\n\n          Warui argues to us that her case should be reopened\n\nbecause the law regarding withholding of removal and CAT relief in\n\ncases where a petitioner has been subjected to FGM has changed in\n\nlight of the Attorney General's recent decision in Matter of A-T,\n\n24 I & N Dec. 617 (A.G. 2008).2    The facts of Matter of A-T easily\n\n\n     2\n          The decision was issued after the BIA's September 15,\n2008 denial of Warui's motion to reopen. No party has argued that\nthis issue should be remanded to the BIA, nor in this instance\n\n                                  -8-\n\fdistinguish it from this case.               That case addressed whether a\n\nwoman's having undergone FGM could constitute past persecution for\n\npurposes of a withholding of removal claim.                    Id.    Here, the\n\npetitioner has not undergone FGM and she was found not to have been\n\npersecuted on other grounds.       Thus Matter of A-T does not enable\n\nher to present a prima facie case for relief.\n\n           Warui's    brief   improperly       attempts   to     challenge   the\n\nfindings of the BIA and the IJ regarding the original claims for\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under the CAT. A petition to\n\nreview those findings was not timely filed after the BIA's May 28,\n\n2008   order   of   removal   became    final.      8   U.S.C.    §   1252(b)(1)\n\n(requiring that petitions for review be filed within thirty days of\n\na final order of removal); Ven v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 357, 359 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (\"A motion to reopen or reconsider does not toll the\n\nperiod for filing a petition for judicial review of the underlying\n\norder of deportation.\").         We accordingly lack jurisdiction to\n\nconsider them.\n\n           The petition for review of the denial of the motion to\n\nreopen is denied; the attempt to challenge the BIA's May 28, 2008\n\norder is dismissed.\n\n\n\n\nwould a remand be appropriate.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f",

The BIA denied her motion to reopen and remand her case for further consideration of her claims for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). We deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Warui entered the United States from Kenya on November 30, 2001 as a visitor, authorized to remain in the country until May 29, 2002. She overstayed. On October 14, 2004, the Department of Homeland <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> Security filed a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") in Immigration Court, initiating removal proceedings against Warui.</p>\n<p>Her husband, Leonard Karioki, also a native and citizen of Kenya, entered the United States on April 6, 2004 and overstayed his visa. He was placed in separate removal proceedings around the same time as Warui. On January 7, 2005, Warui sought to consolidate her case with that of her husband, admitting certain allegations in the NTA and conceding removability. The cases were subsequently consolidated.</p>\n<p>On March 10, 2005, Karioki applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. As part of his application, he sought derivative asylum relief for Warui as his spouse. Warui was ineligible for asylum in her own right because she had not filed a timely application. Warui did not make independent claims for withholding of removal and CAT protection.</p>\n<p>At a merits hearing held on May 8, 2006, Warui and Karioki both testified in support of their claims. In their testimony, they expressed fear that if they were removed to Kenya Warui would be forced to undergo female genital mutilation (\"FGM\") by a group called the Mungiki.</p>\n<p>In his oral decision, the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") first found that Karioki and Warui did not testify credibly, based on inconsistencies in their testimony. Even assuming the two had testified credibly, the IJ found Karioki's and Warui's testimony still insufficient to meet their burden for asylum for several reasons. First, the IJ found that Karioki and Warui had testified they had been harassed by the Mungiki for nearly thirty years but they had never been harmed, and so their fear of harm seemed \"implausible.\" Second, the IJ found that they had failed to show that the harm they feared was at the hands of a group which the government was unable or unwilling to control, pointing to a State Department report showing that the Kenyan government had banned the Mungiki and were trying to enforce the law against them. Finally, the IJ found the fear of future persecution inconsistent with the fact that Karioki and Warui's sons, who remained in Kenya, were married and their wives had not been forced to undergo FGM.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied their claim for asylum. He denied the withholding of removal and CAT claims because these claims carry a higher burden of proof than asylum and therefore Karioki and Warui could not prove it more likely than not that they would undergo persecution or torture if returned. The IJ granted voluntary departure to Warui but denied it to Karioki.</p>\n<p>Karioki and Warui filed a timely appeal to the BIA. On May 28, 2008, the BIA denied them relief; it affirmed the IJ's determination with respect to lack of credibility and his alternate findings with respect to denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>Warui did not file a petition for review with this court. Instead, she filed a motion to reopen with the BIA on June 25, 2008, seeking to apply individually for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. In this motion, she informed the BIA that she and her husband were divorced and that Karioki had returned to Kenya.</p>\n<p>On September 15, 2008, the BIA denied her motion. The BIA first held that Warui had failed to present any material new facts that could be proven in a new hearing or previously unavailable evidence. Second, the BIA pointed out that Warui had failed to challenge the IJ's adverse credibility finding with respect to both her and her husband. Based on this, the BIA could not \"conclude that any application <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> for relief is now reasonably likely to succeed on the merits in order to warrant reopening.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>In general, motions to reopen removal proceedings are not favored because \"such motions are at odds with the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.\" <i>Beltre-Veloz v.

It is not entirely clear from her briefs or from the BIA's and IJ's opinions whether her derivative asylum application purported to include \"derivative\" claims for withholding of removal and protection under CAT. Unlike the statute governing asylum applications, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, the statutes and regulations covering withholding of removal and the CAT do not contain provisions for derivative claims, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b), (c). This circuit has explicitly held that derivative claims cannot be made for withholding of removal, <i>Kechichian,</i> 535 F.3d at 22 n. 4, and other circuits have held the same with respect to the CAT, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Martinez v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,</i> 324 Fed.Appx. 829, 833-34 (11th Cir.2009); <i>Oforji v. Ashcroft,</i> 354 F.3d 609, 615 (7th Cir.2003). We assume in her favor that Warui has only made a derivative claim for asylum and that withholding of removal and protection under CAT are the new claims she seeks to submit through a motion to reopen. Even so, we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen to let her present those claims on her own behalf.</p>\n<p>As the BIA noted, Warui's motion did not state any new facts material to her claims and it was not supported by any previously unavailable evidence. Her motion stated as \"new facts\" that she and her husband had been divorced and that he had departed the United States, but she did not argue that this changed the material facts which had been presented in support of the original claims for relief. Rather, the motion simply requested the right to make her own application for withholding of removal and CAT protectiona claim that would have been based on the same facts previously presented to the IJ. Given that the standard for withholding of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> removal places a higher burden on the applicant to prove past or future persecution, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen the withholding of removal claim. <i>Usman v. Holder,</i> 566 F.3d 262, 268 (1st Cir.2009). On those facts, she could not make a prima facie case for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p>The same is true of Warui's CAT claim, which requires a finding that she will \"more likely than not\" experience torture if removed. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(4). She does not claim to have already suffered torture. Since she could not meet the lower standard of showing a well-founded fear she would suffer harm if removed, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that she did not present a prima facie case for relief under the CAT. <i>Usman,</i> 566 F.3d at 268.</p>\n<p>In her brief here, Warui makes a different argument. She argues that the BIA should reopen her case based on changed circumstances, specifically that her case was \"in effect abandoned\" because of her divorce and Karioki's departure. Yet, as the BIA found, the material facts which underlie Warui's purported new claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT are the same as those which led to denial of asylum. On this basis, the BIA's decision not to reopen was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Further, as the BIA pointed out, Warui's motion to reopen made no challenge to the credibility findings made against her by the IJ. Warui now concedes that Karioki may not have testified credibly and argues that she should be given an opportunity to establish her own credibility. Yet Warui availed herself of just such an opportunity in the original proceedings. She testified at the May 8, 2006 merits hearing, and the IJ and BIA reached their credibility finding based on inconsistencies <i>in her own testimony</i> as well as those of her husband.</p>\n<p>Warui argues to us that her case should be reopened because the law regarding withholding of removal and CAT relief in cases where a petitioner has been subjected to FGM has changed in light of the Attorney General's recent decision in <i>Matter of A-T,</i> 24 I &amp; N Dec. 617 (B.I.A. 2008).<sup>[2]</sup> The facts of <i>Matter of A-T</i> easily distinguish it from this case. That case addressed whether a woman's having undergone FGM could constitute past persecution for purposes of a withholding of removal claim. <i>Id.</i> Here, the petitioner has not undergone FGM and she was found not to have been persecuted on other grounds. Thus <i>Matter of A-T</i> does not enable her to present a prima facie case for relief.</p>\n<p>Warui's brief improperly attempts to challenge the findings of the BIA and the IJ regarding the original claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. A petition to review those findings was not timely filed after the BIA's May 28, 2008 order of removal became final. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1) (requiring that petitions for review be filed within thirty days of a final order of removal); <i>Ven v. Ashcroft,</i> 386 F.3d 357, 359 (1st Cir.2004) (\"A motion to reopen or reconsider does not toll the period for filing a petition for judicial review of the underlying order of deportation.\").

Pettinato, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for the respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, BOUDIN and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Mary Wangui Warui, of Kenya, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denial of her motion to reopen. The BIA denied her motion to reopen and remand her case for further consideration of her claims for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). We deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Warui entered the United States from Kenya on November 30, 2001 as a visitor, authorized to remain in the country until May 29, 2002. She overstayed. On October 14, 2004, the Department of Homeland <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> Security filed a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") in Immigration Court, initiating removal proceedings against Warui.</p>\n<p>Her husband, Leonard Karioki, also a native and citizen of Kenya, entered the United States on April 6, 2004 and overstayed his visa. He was placed in separate removal proceedings around the same time as Warui. On January 7, 2005, Warui sought to consolidate her case with that of her husband, admitting certain allegations in the NTA and conceding removability. The cases were subsequently consolidated.</p>\n<p>On March 10, 2005, Karioki applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. As part of his application, he sought derivative asylum relief for Warui as his spouse. Warui was ineligible for asylum in her own right because she had not filed a timely application. Warui did not make independent claims for withholding of removal and CAT protection.</p>\n<p>At a merits hearing held on May 8, 2006, Warui and Karioki both testified in support of their claims. In their testimony, they expressed fear that if they were removed to Kenya Warui would be forced to undergo female genital mutilation (\"FGM\") by a group called the Mungiki.</p>\n<p>In his oral decision, the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") first found that Karioki and Warui did not testify credibly, based on inconsistencies in their testimony. Even assuming the two had testified credibly, the IJ found Karioki's and Warui's testimony still insufficient to meet their burden for asylum for several reasons. First, the IJ found that Karioki and Warui had testified they had been harassed by the Mungiki for nearly thirty years but they had never been harmed, and so their fear of harm seemed \"implausible.\" Second, the IJ found that they had failed to show that the harm they feared was at the hands of a group which the government was unable or unwilling to control, pointing to a State Department report showing that the Kenyan government had banned the Mungiki and were trying to enforce the law against them. Finally, the IJ found the fear of future persecution inconsistent with the fact that Karioki and Warui's sons, who remained in Kenya, were married and their wives had not been forced to undergo FGM.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied their claim for asylum. He denied the withholding of removal and CAT claims because these claims carry a higher burden of proof than asylum and therefore Karioki and Warui could not prove it more likely than not that they would undergo persecution or torture if returned. The IJ granted voluntary departure to Warui but denied it to Karioki.</p>\n<p>Karioki and Warui filed a timely appeal to the BIA. On May 28, 2008, the BIA denied them relief; it affirmed the IJ's determination with respect to lack of credibility and his alternate findings with respect to denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>Warui did not file a petition for review with this court. Instead, she filed a motion to reopen with the BIA on June 25, 2008, seeking to apply individually for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. In this motion, she informed the BIA that she and her husband were divorced and that Karioki had returned to Kenya.</p>\n<p>On September 15, 2008, the BIA denied her motion. The BIA first held that Warui had failed to present any material new facts that could be proven in a new hearing or previously unavailable evidence. Second, the BIA pointed out that Warui had failed to challenge the IJ's adverse credibility finding with respect to both her and her husband. Based on this, the BIA could not \"conclude that any application <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> for relief is now reasonably likely to succeed on the merits in order to warrant reopening.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>In general, motions to reopen removal proceedings are not favored because \"such motions are at odds with the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.\" <i>Beltre-Veloz v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203423\"><a href=\"/opinion/203423/beltre-veloz-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Guerrero-Santana v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202900\"><a href=\"/opinion/202900/guerrero-santana-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.2007)). We review denials by the BIA of motions to reopen for abuse of discretion.<sup>[1]</sup><i>Kechichian v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203402\"><a href=\"/opinion/203402/kechichian-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2008). A decision by the BIA will survive review unless a petitioner can show that it \"committed an error of law or exercised its judgment in an arbitrary, capricious, or irrational way.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Raza v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202713\"><a href=\"/opinion/202713/raza-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span>, 127 (1st Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p>A motion to reopen may only be granted if it states \"new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Such a motion \"shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\" <i>Id.</i> In addition, \"[a] motion to reopen must be denied unless petitioners' new evidence establishes a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief.\" <i>Chikkeur v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203124\"><a href=\"/opinion/203124/chikkeur-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span>, 1383 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Warui's motion to reopen requested an opportunity to present her own claims for withholding of removal and protection under CAT. It is not entirely clear from her briefs or from the BIA's and IJ's opinions whether her derivative asylum application purported to include \"derivative\" claims for withholding of removal and protection under CAT. Unlike the statute governing asylum applications, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, the statutes and regulations covering withholding of removal and the CAT do not contain provisions for derivative claims, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b), (c). This circuit has explicitly held that derivative claims cannot be made for withholding of removal, <i>Kechichian,</i> 535 F.3d at 22 n. 4, and other circuits have held the same with respect to the CAT, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Martinez v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,</i> 324 Fed.Appx. 829, 833-34 (11th Cir.2009); <i>Oforji v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784677\"><a href=\"/opinion/784677/doris-c-oforji-v-john-d-ashcroft-united-states-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span>, 615 (7th Cir.2003). We assume in her favor that Warui has only made a derivative claim for asylum and that withholding of removal and protection under CAT are the new claims she seeks to submit through a motion to reopen. Even so, we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen to let her present those claims on her own behalf.</p>\n<p>As the BIA noted, Warui's motion did not state any new facts material to her claims and it was not supported by any previously unavailable evidence.

On those facts, she could not make a prima facie case for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p>The same is true of Warui's CAT claim, which requires a finding that she will \"more likely than not\" experience torture if removed. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(4).
