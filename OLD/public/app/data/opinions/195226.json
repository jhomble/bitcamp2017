Magendantz, 848 F.2d 303,\n                                            \n\n305 (1st Cir. 1988); Computer Sys. Eng'g v.  Quantel Corp.,\n                                                          \n\n740 F.2d 59, 65 (1st Cir. 1984).\n\n         In 1985,  Romero was suffering from  back pain and\n\nsearching  for solutions.    Dr.  Nancy  Alfonso,  Romero's\n\nfamily physician, provided some treatment but then referred\n\nhim  to Dr. Borras,  a neurosurgeon.   Dr. Borras concluded\n\nthat  Romero had  a herniated  disc and  scheduled surgery.\n\nPrior  to  surgery,  Dr.  Borras  neither  prescribed   nor\n\nenforced a  regime of absolute  bed rest, nor did  he offer\n\nother key components of \"conservative treatment.\"  Although\n\nDr. Borras instructed Romero, a heavy  smoker, to enter the\n\nhospital one  week before surgery  in order to  \"clean out\"\n\nhis lungs  and strengthen his  heart, Romero was  still not\n\nsubjected to standard conservative treatment.\n\n         While  operating  on  April  9,  1986,  Dr. Borras\n\ndiscovered that Romero had an \"extruded\" disc and attempted\n\nto  remove the  extruding  material.   Either  because  Dr.\n\nBorras failed to  remove the offending material  or because\n\nhe operated at the  wrong level, Romero's original symptoms\n\nreturned  in full force  several days after  the operation.\n\nDr. Borras concluded that a second operation  was necessary\n\nto remedy the \"recurrence.\"\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n         Dr.  Borras operated again  on May 15,  1986.  Dr.\n\nBorras did  not order pre-  or post-operative  antibiotics.\n\nIt is unclear  whether the second operation  was successful\n\nin curing the  herniated disc.  In  any event, as  early as\n\nMay 17,  a nurse's note indicates that the bandage covering\n\nRomero's surgical wound was \"very bloody,\" a symptom which,\n\naccording to expert testimony, indicates the possibility of\n\ninfection.  On  May 18, Romero was  experiencing local pain\n\nat the  site of  the incision,  another symptom  consistent\n\nwith  an infection.   On  May 19,  the bandage  was \"soiled\n\nagain.\"     A  more complete  account of  Romero's evolving\n\ncondition is  not available because the Hospital instructed\n\nnurses  to  engage  in \"charting  by  exception,\"  a system\n\nwhereby  nurses did not record qualitative observations for\n\neach of the day's three shifts, but instead made such notes\n\nonly  when necessary  to chronicle  important changes  in a\n\npatient's condition.3\n\n         On the night of May 20, Romero began to experience\n\nsevere discomfort  in  his  back.    He  passed  the  night\n\nscreaming in pain.  At some point on May 21, Dr. Edwin Lugo\n\nPiazza,  an attending  physician, diagnosed the  problem as\n\n                   \n3.  Notwithstanding  the  \"charting   by  exception\"  policy,\nnurses  regularly recorded routine  quantitative data such as\nthe  patient's body temperature.   Romero apparently  did not\ndevelop  a fever (another  possible sign of  infection) until\nMay 21.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\ndiscitis -- an infection of  the space between discs -- and\n\nresponded by initiating antibiotic treatment.  Discitis  is\n\nextremely painful and, since  it occurs in a  location with\n\nlittle blood  circulation, very slow  to cure.   Romero was\n\nhospitalized for several additional months while undergoing\n\ntreatment for the infection.   \n\n         After  moving  from Puerto  Rico  to Florida,  the\n\nRomeros filed  this diversity tort action  in United States\n\nDistrict   Court  for   the   District  of   Puerto  Rico.4\n\nPlaintiffs alleged  that Dr. Borras  was negligent  in four\n\ngeneral  areas: (1) failure  to provide proper conservative\n\nmedical  treatment;  (2) premature  and  otherwise improper\n\ndischarge  after  surgery;  (3)  negligent  performance  of\n\nsurgery;  and (4) failure to  provide proper management for\n\nthe  infection.   While plaintiffs did  not claim  that the\n\nHospital was  vicariously liable for any  negligence on the\n\npart  of Dr.  Borras, they  alleged that  the Hospital  was\n\nitself  negligent in two respects:  (1) failure to prepare,\n\nuse, and monitor proper medical records; and (2) failure to\n\nprovide proper hygiene at the hospital premises.\n\n                   \n4.  In  addition to the  Borras Defendants and  the Hospital,\nplaintiffs  named as defendants  several other physicians, as\nwell  as  their spouses  and  insurers.   The  district court\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the other defendants and\nthat decision is not at issue in this appeal.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n         At each  appropriate moment,  defendants attempted\n\nto  remove the case from the jury.  Before trial they moved\n\nfor summary judgment.   See  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 56.   At  the\n                           \n\nclose  of plaintiffs'  case and  at  the close  of all  the\n\nevidence, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nSee  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  50(a).   After the  jury returned  a\n   \n\nverdict  awarding   plaintiffs  $600,000   in  compensatory\n\ndamages, defendants  again sought  judgment as a  matter of\n\nlaw.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b).   Additionally, the Borras\n         \n\nDefendants requested either a new trial or remittitur.  See\n                                                           \n\nFed. R. Civ.  P. 50(b) and 59.  At each procedural step and\n\nwith respect  to each allegation of negligence, defendants'\n\nprimary  argument  was   that  plaintiffs  had  failed   to\n\nestablish  the  required  elements  of  duty,  breach,  and\n\ncausation.\n\n         The  district court  rebuffed  all of  defendants'\n\nentreaties, ruling that the evidence was legally sufficient\n\nto fuel the jury's deliberations and ultimately  to support\n\nits findings.  Because our  analysis necessarily focuses on\n\nthe denial  of the post-verdict  motions for judgment  as a\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nmatter  of  law,5 we  quote  at  length  from the  district\n\ncourt's order denying those motions:\n\n              In  reference  to  Dr.  Borras,  the\n         evidence,   seen   in  the   light   most\n         favorable to the  plaintiffs, allowed the\n         jury to at least conclude that Dr. Borras\n                                  \n         failed  to  pursue   a  well-planned  and\n         managed,  conservative  treatment  course\n         for  Roberto Romero  Lama's back  ailment\n         before  exposing  him   to  the  inherent\n         dangers  of a  herniated disc  operation.\n         Had  such  conservative   treatment  been\n         successful,   then    the   post-surgical\n         complications  that   unfortunately  took\n\n                    \n5.  We  do not  directly address  the merits of  the Borras\n\nDefendants' pre-verdict  challenges to  the sufficiency  of\nthe  evidence.  The Borras Defendants' attack on the denial\nof  summary  judgment  has  been  overtaken  by  subsequent\nevents,  namely,  a full-dress  trial  and an  adverse jury\nverdict.  In  these circumstances, we will  not address the\npropriety of the denial of summary judgment.

Were we to\nconsider  the issue, we  would find the  Borras Defendants'\nposition to be  without merit.  For similar  reasons, we do\nnot separately address  the district court's denial  of the\nBorras  Defendants'  Rule 50(a)  motion  for judgment  as a\nmatter of law, which is either non-appealable at this stage\nor resolved by our affirmance of  the denial of defendants'\nRule 50(b) motions.

A reasonable  jury could\n         have concluded that the negligent act was\n         the recommendation  of a  first operation\n         without   the   benefit   of   additional\n         conservative treatment . . . .\n\n              As to  Hospital del Maestro,  it was\n         entirely   possible  for   the  jury   to\n         conclude that the particular way in which\n         the medical and nursing records were kept\n         constituted evidence  of carelessness  in\n         monitoring the  patient after  the second\n         operation.   Perhaps the  infection would\n         have   been   reported   and   documented\n         earlier.

See\n                                                           \n\nRolon-Alvarado v.  Municipality of San Juan, 1  F.3d 74, 77\n                                           \n\n(1st  Cir. 1993).   We  must sustain  the district  court's\n\ndenial of a  Rule 50(b) motion for judgment  as a matter of\n\nlaw, \"unless  the  evidence, together  with all  reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the verdict, could lead a reasonable\n\nperson  to only  one conclusion,  namely,  that the  moving\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nparty was entitled  to judgment.\"  PH Group  Ltd. v.

As in the case of duty, however, a jury normally\n\ncannot  find  causation  based  on  mere  speculation   and\n\nconjecture;  expert testimony is generally essential.

Negligence of Dr. Borras\n                            \n\n         The Borras Defendants claim that plaintiffs failed\n\nto  introduce any evidence  sufficient to prove  either (1)\n\nthe relevant  standards of  acceptable medical practice  or\n\n(2) the causal link between Dr. Borras' conduct and harm to\n\nthe plaintiffs.  While plaintiffs may not have been able to\n\nsubstantiate the broad attack outlined  in their complaint,\n\nwe focus  here on  only one  allegation of negligence:  Dr.\n\nBorras' failure to provide conservative treatment prior  to\n\nthe first operation.  \n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n         Defendants argue that plaintiffs failed to prove a\n\ngeneral   medical   standard   governing   the   need   for\n\nconservative treatment in  a case like that of  Romero.  We\n\ndisagree.   Plaintiffs'  chief  expert witness,  Dr. George\n\nUdvarhelyi,  testified   that,  absent  an   indication  of\n\nneurological  impairment, the  standard practice  is  for a\n\nneurosurgeon  to postpone  lumbar  disc  surgery while  the\n\npatient undergoes conservative treatment,  with a period of\n\nabsolute  bed  rest as  the  prime ingredient.7    In these\n\nrespects, the views of defendants' neurosurgery experts did\n\nnot diverge from those of Dr. Udvarhelyi.  For example, Dr.\n\nLuis  Guzman  Lopez  testified  that,  in  the  absence  of\n\nextraordinary   factors,   \"all    neurosurgeons   go   for\n\n[conservative treatment] before they finally decide on [an]\n\noperation.\"8    Indeed,  when  called  by  plaintiffs,  Dr.\n\n                    \n\n7.  Dr. Udvarhelyi  testified that \"[i]n  general, when you\nhave  a  relatively  mild  protrusion  of  the  disk  [sic]\nmaterial,  our policy is that you  provide the patient with\nthe  possibility  of  a conservative  treatment.\"    If Dr.\nUdvarhelyi's reference to \"our policy\" merely represented a\npersonal  view about what  he would have  done differently,\nhis  statement  would  not  be  sufficient to  establish  a\n\ngeneral  medical standard.   See Rolon-Alvarado, 1  F.3d at\n                                               \n78.   The  jury was  free, however,  to conclude  that \"our\npolicy\" referred  to  the policy  shared by  neurosurgeons,\nparticularly where  nearly all of  defendants' neurosurgery\nexperts  espoused the same basic \"policy.\" In addition, Dr.\nUdvarhelyi later testified, \"I couldn't see evidence that a\nproper  time  was  given for  the  conservative  management\n      \nbefore deciding surgery.\"  (Emphasis added).\n\n8.  Defendants  argue  that,   even  if  Dr.   Udvarhelyi's\ntestimony represents the  generally accepted standard, that\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nBorras (who also testified as a neurosurgery expert) agreed\n\non cross-examination with  the statement that \"bed  rest is\n\nnormally recommended before surgery is decided in a patient\n\nlike Mr. Romero,\" and claimed that he did give conservative\n                                         \n\ntreatment to Romero.\n\n         In spite of Dr. Borras' testimony to the contrary,\n\nthere  was also sufficient  evidence for  the jury  to find\n\nthat   Dr.  Borras   failed   to   provide  the   customary\n\nconservative  treatment.    Dr.  Alfonso,  Romero's  family\n\nphysician, testified  that  Dr. Borras,  while  aware  that\n\nRomero had  not followed  a program  of absolute  bed rest,\n\nproceeded   with  surgery  anyway.    Although  Romero  was\n\nadmitted to the hospital one week before surgery, there was\n\nevidence that  Dr. Borras neither prescribed  nor attempted\n\nto enforce a conservative treatment regime.  In fact, there\n\nwas evidence that Dr. Borras' main goal was simply to admit\n\nRomero  for a week  of smoke-free relaxation,  not absolute\n\nbed  rest,   because  Romero's  heavy   smoking  and   mild\n\n                    \nstandard does not apply to Romero's case because, according\nto some of the defense witnesses, Romero was suffering from\n                                            \nneurological impairments prior  to the first surgery.   Dr.\n\nGuzman,  for example, claimed that Romero \"had neurological\ndeficit  from  the  very  beginning.\"    In  contrast,  Dr.\nUdvarhelyi, who claimed  that he was fully aware  of all of\nRomero's  symptoms, opined  that Romero's  symptoms at  the\ntime did  not suggest a  neurological deficit.  This  was a\ndisputed factual issue for the  jury to resolve.  We cannot\nsay that  it would have  been unreasonable for the  jury to\nresolve this dispute in plaintiffs' favor.\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nhypertension  made him  a high-risk  surgery  patient.   In\n\nshort, we agree with the district court that the jury could\n\nreasonably  have  concluded  that  Dr.  Borras   failed  to\n\ninstitute and manage a proper conservative treatment plan.\n\n         The  issue   of   causation   is   somewhat   more\n\nproblematic.  There are two potential snags in the chain of\n\ncausation.  First,  it is uncertain that  premature surgery\n\nwas  the cause  of  Romero's  infection.     Second, it  is\n\nuncertain whether  conservative treatment  would have  made\n\nsurgery  unnecessary.  With  respect to the  first problem,\n\nthe Puerto  Rico Supreme Court  has suggested that,  when a\n\nphysician  negligently  exposes  a  patient  to  risk-prone\n\nsurgery,  the physician is  liable for the  harm associated\n\nwith a foreseeable risk.   See Cruz Rodriguez, 13 P.R. Sup.\n                                             \n\nCt.  Off'l Translations at  956 (\"A treatment  that submits\n\nthe  patient to unnecessary and foreseeable risks cannot be\n\nconsidered  reasonable, when alternate  means to  reduce or\n                      \n\navoid  them  are  available.\").    In   this  case,  it  is\n\nundisputed that discitis  was a foreseeable risk  of lumbar\n\ndisc surgery. \n\n           Turning to  the second  area of  uncertainty, we\n\nobserve that nearly all of the experts who testified on the\n\nsubject  for both  plaintiffs and  defendants  were of  the\n\nopinion  that  conservative treatment  would  eliminate the\n\nneed for  surgery in  the overwhelming  majority of  cases.\n\nNonetheless, defendants  introduced expert  testimony that,\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nbecause   Romero   suffered   from  an   \"extruded\"   disc,\n\nconservative  treatment  would   not  have  helped.     Dr.\n\nUdvarhelyi testified,  however,  that an  extruded disc  is\n\nindeed amenable to conservative treatment.  With  competent\n\nexpert testimony  in the record,  the jury was not  left to\n\nconjure  up its own theories  of causation.  And certainly,\n\nthe  jury  was  free  to credit  some  witnesses  more than\n\nothers.   The  question is  admittedly close, but  the jury\n\ncould have  reasonably found  that Dr.  Borras' failure  to\n\nadminister  conservative treatment  was the  \"most probable\n\ncause\" of the first operation.\n\n         We  conclude  that plaintiffs  introduced  legally\n\nsufficient evidence to support each element of at least one\n\nmajor  allegation of negligence on the  part of Dr. Borras.\n\nWe therefore hold  that the district court  properly denied\n\nthe Borras Defendants' Rule 50 and Rule 59 motions. \n\nC.  Negligence of Asociacion Hospital Del Maestro\n                                                 \n\n         While  plaintiffs  made  a  number of  allegations\n\nagainst the Hospital,  we focus on the allegation  that the\n\nfailure of hospital nurses to  report on each nursing shift\n\nwas  a negligent  cause of the  late detection  of Romero's\n\ninfection.9\n\n                    \n\n9.  Since we do not  reach the issue of the alleged lack of\nproper  hygiene at the  hospital, we  need not  discuss the\nHospital's  argument  that  the  district  court  erred  in\nallowing  Dr.   Udvarhelyi,  who   qualified   only  as   a\nneurosurgery expert  and allegedly  pledged not  to testify\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\n         The   Hospital  cannot   seriously  dispute   that\n\nplaintiffs introduced  sufficient evidence on  the elements\n\nof  duty  and  breach.    The  Hospital  does  not  contest\n\nplaintiffs' allegation that a regulation of the Puerto Rico\n\nDepartment  of   Health,  in   force   in  1986,   requires\n\nqualitative  nurses' notes for  each nursing shift.10   Nor\n\ndoes  the Hospital dispute the charge that, during Romero's\n\nhospital  stay,  the  nurses attending  to  Romero  did not\n\nsupply  the  required  notes for  every  shift  but instead\n\nfollowed the  Hospital's  official policy  of  charting  by\n\nexception.  The  sole question, then, is  whether there was\n\nsufficient evidence for the jury to find that violation  of\n\nthe regulation was a proximate cause of harm to Romero.11\n\n         The  Hospital   questions  plaintiffs'   proof  of\n\ncausation in two respects.  First, the Hospital claims that\n\nplaintiffs did  not prove  that the  charting by  exception\n\npolicy was  a proximate cause  of the delayed  detection of\n\n                    \nagainst  the  hospital,  to  testify  about the  effect  of\n\ncockroaches in the hospital on the likelihood of infection.\n\n10.  The  regulation itself was not made part of the record\non appeal.\n\n11.   The district  judge suggested that causation  was the\nprincipal issue  for jury consideration  when he instructed\nthe jury that \"violation of [a] law or regulation is not in\nitself  enough to constitute negligence absent proof of the\nexistence  of   the  proximate  cause  between  the  damage\nallegedly sustained and  such alleged violation of  the law\nand/or of the regulation.\"   Neither party objected  to the\njury instructions.\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nRomero's infection.  Second, the Hospital argues that there\n\nwas no causal relationship between the belated diagnosis of\n\nthe  infection and any unnecessary harm suffered by Romero.\n\nWe address each of these arguments in turn.  \n\n         The  Hospital   essentially  argues  that   it  is\n\nuncertain whether the hospital  staff observed, but  failed\n\nto record, any  material symptoms that would  probably have\n\nled an  attending physician to investigate  the possibility\n\nof an  infection at an  earlier stage.  The  Hospital notes\n\nthat,  even under  the charting  by  exception policy,  its\n\nnurses regularly recorded such information as the patient's\n\ntemperature, vital signs,  and any medication given  to the\n\npatient.   Indeed, there is  some evidence that  Romero did\n\nnot have  a fever (one  possible sign of  infection) before\n\nMay  21, when Dr. Piazza  diagnosed the infection and began\n\nantibiotic treatment.\n\n         Nonetheless,  there was  evidence  from which  the\n\njury could have  inferred that, as part of  the practice of\n\ncharting  by exception, the nurses did not regularly record\n\ncertain  information  important  to  the  diagnosis  of  an\n\ninfection,  such as  the  changing  characteristics of  the\n\nsurgical  wound  and  the  patient's  complaints  of  post-\n\noperative  pain.  Indeed, one former  nurse at the Hospital\n\nwho attended to  Romero in 1986  testified that, under  the\n\ncharting  by exception  policy,  she  would  not  report  a\n\npatient's  pain  if  she  either  did  not  administer  any\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nmedicine  or  simply  gave   the  patient  an  aspirin-type\n\nmedication  (as opposed  to a  narcotic).   Further,  since\n\nthere was evidence that Romero's hospital records contained\n\nsome scattered possible signs of infection that,  according\n\nto Dr. Udvarhelyi, deserved further investigation (e.g., an\n\nexcessively bloody bandage  and local pain  at the site  of\n\nthe  wound), the jury  could have reasonably  inferred that\n\nintermittent  charting  failed  to   provide  the  sort  of\n\ncontinuous danger  signals that  would be  the most  likely\n\nspur to early intervention by a physician.\n\n         The Hospital claims, however, that, even if faulty\n\nrecord-keeping   is  a  cause  of  the  delayed  diagnosis,\n\nplaintiffs  failed to demonstrate a link between the timing\n\nof the diagnosis  and the harm Romero  eventually suffered.\n\nDrawing  all  inferences  in favor  of  the  plaintiffs, it\n\nappears that Romero acquired a wound infection  as early as\n\nMay 17 (when a nurse noted a \"very bloody\"  bandage) or May\n\n19  (when Romero  complained of  pain  at the  site of  the\n\nwound); the wound infection then developed into discitis on\n\nor   about   May   20  (when   Romero   began  experiencing\n\nexcruciating back pain).  While  there may have been no way\n\nto  prevent the initial  wound infection, the  key question\n\nthen becomes whether  early detection and treatment  of the\n\nwound infection  could  have prevented  the infection  from\n\nreaching the disc  interspace in the critical  period prior\n\nto May 20.\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\n         Dr.   Udvarhelyi  testified   that  \"time   is  an\n\nextremely  important factor\" in handling an infection; a 24\n\nhour delay in treatment can  make a difference; and a delay\n\nof  several  days  \"carries  a  high-risk  [sic]  that  the\n\ninfection  will [not be]  properly controlled.\"   Here, the\n\njury  could  have  reasonably inferred  that  diagnosis and\n\ntreatment were  delayed at least  24 hours (May 19  to 20),\n\nand perhaps 72 (May 17 to 20).  As a result, the jury could\n\nhave  reasonably concluded that the timing of the diagnosis\n\nand  treatment of the wound infection was a proximate cause\n\nof Romero's discitis.   \n\n         In  conclusion, we  agree with the  district judge\n\nthat this  case \"is by  no means the  strongest proposition\n\nfor  medical malpractice against . .  . a hospital,\" Romero\n                                                           \n\nLama, slip  op. at 3.   Nevertheless, we  find none of  the\n    \n\nHospital's  arguments  persuasive  enough  to  disturb  the\n\nverdict.  We hold that plaintiffs met their burden of proof\n\nas  to  the  allegation  that  the  Hospital's  substandard\n\nrecord-keeping   procedures  delayed   the  diagnosis   and\n\ntreatment  of Romero's  wound  infection  at  a  time  when\n\ncontrolling the wound  infection was likely to  prevent the\n\ndevelopment  of the  more serious  discitis.   Accordingly,\n\nthere was  no error in  the district court's denial  of the\n\nHospital's Rule 50(b)  motion for judgment  as a matter  of\n\nlaw.\n\n                            IV.\n                               \n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n\n                         CONCLUSION\n                                   \n\n         There  is  no need  to  discuss  defendants' other\n\nassignments of  error.12   For the  foregoing reasons,  the\n\norder of the district court denying defendants' motions for\n\njudgment  as a  matter  of law  and the  Borras Defendants'\n\nmotions for new trial is \n\n         Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n12.  Appellants'  other  arguments  on  appeal  are   moot,\nmeritless, or waived.  First, because the denial of summary\njudgment is now a  non-issue, see supra note  5, so is  the\n                                       \nquestion  whether  the  district court,  in  ruling  on the\n\nmotion for summary judgment, failed to  adhere to the local\nrules of  the District of  Puerto Rico in its  treatment of\nallegedly  uncontroverted facts.    Second,  we discern  no\nreversible  error  in the  district  court's denial  of the\nBorras  Defendants'  \"informative  motion\"  concerning  the\ndeposition  of  Dr.  Barth Green,  a  neurosurgeon  who was\ntreating  Romero at  the time  of  the trial,  and who  had\nplanned  to operate  on Romero  in  1992 in  an attempt  to\nrelieve Romero's persistent back  pain.  We are puzzled  as\nto   how  an   \"informative\"   motion   can  be   \"denied,\"\n\nparticularly  where leave  of  court  would  appear  to  be\nunnecessary, see  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 30(a), and no  party has\n                \nmoved for  a protective order,  see Fed. R. Civ.  P. 26(c).\n                                   \nBut even  if the  district court  abused its  discretion in\ncurtailing  discovery  of  relevant  material,  the  Borras\nDefendants had other means of countering plaintiffs'  proof\nof  physical  injury,  and Romero's  condition  in  1992 is\nirrelevant  to the compensable  harm suffered by plaintiffs\nprior to  1992.  In  short, the Borras Defendants  have not\n     \ndemonstrated  the  \"substantial   prejudice\"  necessary  to\n\njustify appellate intervention.  Mack  v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac.\n                                                           \nTea, Inc.,  871 F.2d 179,  186-87 (1st Cir. 1989).   Third,\n         \nsince  the Borras Defendants argued the issue of remittitur\nin  the most perfunctory fashion on  appeal, we deem waived\nany  argument about the  excessiveness of  the compensatory\ndamages.

Santiago-Negron v. Castro-Davila, 865 F.2d 431, 445 (1st Cir.1989);  Forrestal v. Magendantz, 848 F.2d 303, 305 (1st Cir.1988);  Computer Sys. Eng'g v. Qantel Corp., 740 F.2d 59, 65 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, Romero was suffering from back pain and searching for solutions.  Dr. Nancy Alfonso, Romero's family physician, provided some treatment but then referred him to Dr. Borras, a neurosurgeon.  Dr. Borras concluded that Romero had a herniated disc and scheduled surgery.  Prior to surgery, Dr. Borras neither prescribed nor enforced a regime of absolute bed rest, nor did he offer other key components of \"conservative treatment.\"   Although Dr. Borras instructed Romero, a heavy smoker, to enter the hospital one week before surgery in order to \"clean out\" his lungs and strengthen his heart, Romero was still not subjected to standard conservative treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While operating on April 9, 1986, Dr. Borras discovered that Romero had an \"extruded\" disc and attempted to remove the extruding material.  Either because Dr. Borras failed to remove the offending material or because he operated at the wrong level, Romero's original symptoms returned in full force several days after the operation.  Dr. Borras concluded that a second operation was necessary to remedy the \"recurrence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Borras operated again on May 15, 1986.  Dr. Borras did not order pre- or post-operative antibiotics.  It is unclear whether the second operation was successful in curing the herniated disc.  In any event, as early as May 17, a nurse's note indicates that the bandage covering Romero's surgical wound was \"very bloody,\" a symptom which, according to expert testimony, indicates the possibility of infection.  On May 18, Romero was experiencing local pain at the site of the incision, another symptom consistent with an infection.  On May 19, the bandage was \"soiled again.\"   A more complete account of Romero's evolving condition is not available because the Hospital instructed nurses to engage in \"charting by exception,\" a system whereby nurses did not record qualitative observations for each of the day's three shifts, but instead made such notes only when necessary to chronicle important changes in a patient's condition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of May 20, Romero began to experience severe discomfort in his back.  He passed the night screaming in pain.  At some point on May 21, Dr. Edwin Lugo Piazza, an attending physician, diagnosed the problem as discitis--an infection of the space between discs--and responded by initiating antibiotic treatment.  Discitis is extremely painful and, since it occurs in a location with little blood circulation, very slow to cure.  Romero was hospitalized for several additional months while undergoing treatment for the infection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After moving from Puerto Rico to Florida, the Romeros filed this diversity tort action in United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Plaintiffs alleged that Dr. Borras was negligent in four general areas:  (1) failure to provide proper conservative medical treatment;  (2) premature and otherwise improper discharge after surgery;  (3) negligent performance of surgery;  and (4) failure to provide proper management for the infection.  While plaintiffs did not claim that the Hospital was vicariously liable for any negligence on the part of Dr. Borras, they alleged that the Hospital was itself negligent in two respects:  (1) failure to prepare, use, and monitor proper medical records;  and (2) failure to provide proper hygiene at the hospital premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At each appropriate moment, defendants attempted to remove the case from the jury.  Before trial they moved for summary judgment.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.  At the close of plaintiffs' case and at the close of all the evidence, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a).  After the jury returned a verdict awarding plaintiffs $600,000 in compensatory damages, defendants again sought judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b).  Additionally, the Borras Defendants requested either a new trial or remittitur.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) and 59.  At each procedural step and with respect to each allegation of negligence, defendants' primary argument was that plaintiffs had failed to establish the required elements of duty, breach, and causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rebuffed all of defendants' entreaties, ruling that the evidence was legally sufficient to fuel the jury's deliberations and ultimately to support its findings.  Because our analysis necessarily focuses on the denial of the post-verdict motions for judgment as a matter of law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we quote at length from the district court's order denying those motions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reference to Dr. Borras, the evidence, seen in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, allowed the jury to at least conclude that Dr. Borras failed to pursue a well-planned and managed, conservative treatment course for Roberto Romero Lama's back ailment before exposing him to the inherent dangers of a herniated disc operation.  Had such conservative treatment been successful, then the post-surgical complications that unfortunately took place in the operated vertebral interspace [including the infection following the second surgery] would not have occurred.  A reasonable jury could have concluded that the negligent act was the recommendation of a first operation without the benefit of additional conservative treatment....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Hospital del Maestro, it was entirely possible for the jury to conclude that the particular way in which the medical and nursing records were kept constituted evidence of carelessness in monitoring the patient after the second operation.  Perhaps the infection would have been reported and documented earlier.  Perhaps the hospital was negligent in not dealing appropriately with wound inspection and cleaning, [and] bandage changing....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romero Lama v. Borras, No. 91-1055, slip op. at 1-2, 1992 WL 584068 (D.P.R. Sept. 1, 1992) (order denying post-verdict motions).  We find the reasoning of the district court to be substantially sound and therefore affirm the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a denial of a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law is plenary, yet highly circumscribed by the deferential Rule 50(b) standard.  See Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir.1993).  We must sustain the district court's denial of a Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law, \"unless the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion, namely, that the moving party was entitled to judgment.\"  PH Group Ltd. v. Birch, 985 F.2d 649, 653 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review for denial of a Rule 59 motion for new trial is similarly circumscribed, but counsels ample deference to the district court's exercise of discretion.  There is no abuse of discretion in such a case unless \"the verdict was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"  Id. (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Borras Defendants correctly argue that the district court may order a new trial even where the verdict is supported by substantial evidence.  E.g., Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987) (citing Hubbard v. Faros Fisheries, Inc., 626 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1980));  see generally 11 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Secs. 2805-2810, at 37-77 (1973) (describing traditional alternative grounds for new trial, including errors of law as well as misconduct on the part of court, counsel, or jury).  However, there is no rule that the district court must do so.  Indeed, we have noted that, where the verdict rests on substantial evidence, it is \" 'only in a very unusual case' \" that we will find that the district court abused its discretion by denying a new trial.  Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200 (quoting Hubbard, 626 F.2d at 200 and Sears v. Pauly, 261 F.2d 304, 309 (1st Cir.1958)).  In other words, when an argument that the evidence was insufficient forms the basis of a motion for new trial, the district court is generally well within the bounds of its discretion in denying the motion using the same reasoning as in its denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.  See Robinson v. Watts Detective Agency, Inc., 685 F.2d 729, 740 (1st Cir.1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1105, 1204, 103 S.Ct. 728, 74 L.Ed.2d 953 (1983).  In these circumstances, then, our review of the denial of a Rule 50 motion is essentially coterminous with our review of the denial of a Rule 50(b) motion.

Medical Malpractice under Puerto Rico Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis by laying out the substantive law of Puerto Rico governing this diversity suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  To establish a prima facie case of medical malpractice in Puerto Rico, a plaintiff must demonstrate:  (1) the basic norms of knowledge and medical care applicable to general practitioners or specialists;  (2) proof that the medical personnel failed to follow these basic norms in the treatment of the patient;  and (3) a causal relation between the act or omission of the physician and the injury suffered by the patient.  Sierra Perez v. United States, 779 F.Supp. 637, 643 (D.P.R.1991);  see also Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 77 &amp; n. 2 (describing elements of medical malpractice in Puerto Rico and noting similarity with other jurisdictions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of a medical malpractice plaintiff in establishing the physician's duty is more complicated than that of an ordinary tort plaintiff.  Instead of simply appealing to the jury's view of what is reasonable under the circumstances, a medical malpractice plaintiff must establish the relevant national standard of care.  See Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 77.   In adopting a national standard, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico explained that physicians are required to provide \"[t]hat [level of care] which, recognizing the modern means of communication and education, ... meets the professional requirements generally acknowledged by the medical profession.\"   Oliveros v. Abreu, 101 P.R.Dec. 209, 226, 1 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations 293, 313 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Naturally, the trier of fact can rarely determine the applicable standard of care without the assistance of expert testimony.  Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 78 (citing Oliveros, 1 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations at 315).  The predictable battle of the experts then creates a curious predicament for the fact-finder, because an error of judgment regarding diagnosis or treatment does not lead to liability when expert opinion suggests that the physician's conduct fell within a range of acceptable alternatives.  See Sierra Perez, 779 F.Supp. at 643-44;  Cruz Rodriguez v. Corporacion de Servicios del Centro Medico de Puerto Rico, 113 P.R.Dec. ___, ___, 13 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations 931, 946 (1983);  Oliveros, 1 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations at 315 (holding that physician is not liable for malpractice when there is \"educated and reasonable doubt\" about the appropriate course).  While not allowed to speculate, the fact-finder is of course free to find some experts more credible than others.  See, e.g., Waffen v. United States Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs., 799 F.2d 911, 921 (4th Cir.1986) (applying Maryland law;  noting that the fact-finder in a medical malpractice case is entitled to decide the weight and credibility of expert testimony);  Rosario v. United States, 824 F.Supp. 268, 279 (D.Mass.1993) (applying Massachusetts law;  similar) (citing Leibovich v. Antonellis, 410 Mass. 568, 572, 574 N.E.2d 978, 982 (1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proof of causation is also more difficult in a medical malpractice case than in a routine tort case because a jury must often grapple with scientific processes that are unfamiliar and involve inherent uncertainty.  A plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the physician's negligent conduct was the factor that \"most probably\" caused harm to the plaintiff.  Sierra Perez, 779 F.Supp. at 643;  Cruz Rodriguez, 13 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations at 960.  \"This fact need not be established with mathematical accuracy[;]  neither must all other cause of damage be eliminated.\"   Cruz Rodriguez, 13 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations at 960-61 (citations omitted).  As in the case of duty, however, a jury normally cannot find causation based on mere speculation and conjecture;  expert testimony is generally essential.  See, e.g., Johns v. Jarrard, 927 F.2d 551, 557 (11th Cir.1991) (applying Georgia law;  observing that medical malpractice plaintiff must usually present expert medical testimony on issue of causation in order to get to a jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Negligence of Dr. Borras</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Borras Defendants claim that plaintiffs failed to introduce any evidence sufficient to prove either (1) the relevant standards of acceptable medical practice or (2) the causal link between Dr. Borras' conduct and harm to the plaintiffs.  While plaintiffs may not have been able to substantiate the broad attack outlined in their complaint, we focus here on only one allegation of negligence:  Dr. Borras' failure to provide conservative treatment prior to the first operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs failed to prove a general medical standard governing the need for conservative treatment in a case like that of Romero.  We disagree.  Plaintiffs' chief expert witness, Dr. George Udvarhelyi, testified that, absent an indication of neurological impairment, the standard practice is for a neurosurgeon to postpone lumbar disc surgery while the patient undergoes conservative treatment, with a period of absolute bed rest as the prime ingredient.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In these respects, the views of defendants' neurosurgery experts did not diverge from those of Dr. Udvarhelyi.  For example, Dr. Luis Guzman Lopez testified that, in the absence of extraordinary factors, \"all neurosurgeons go for [conservative treatment] before they finally decide on [an] operation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Indeed, when called by plaintiffs, Dr. Borras (who also testified as a neurosurgery expert) agreed on cross-examination with the statement that \"bed rest is normally recommended before surgery is decided in a patient like Mr. Romero,\" and claimed that he did give conservative treatment to Romero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of Dr. Borras' testimony to the contrary, there was also sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Dr. Borras failed to provide the customary conservative treatment.  Dr. Alfonso, Romero's family physician, testified that Dr. Borras, while aware that Romero had not followed a program of absolute bed rest, proceeded with surgery anyway.  Although Romero was admitted to the hospital one week before surgery, there was evidence that Dr. Borras neither prescribed nor attempted to enforce a conservative treatment regime.  In fact, there was evidence that Dr. Borras' main goal was simply to admit Romero for a week of smoke-free relaxation, not absolute bed rest, because Romero's heavy smoking and mild hypertension made him a high-risk surgery patient.  In short, we agree with the district court that the jury could reasonably have concluded that Dr. Borras failed to institute and manage a proper conservative treatment plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of causation is somewhat more problematic.  There are two potential snags in the chain of causation.  First, it is uncertain that premature surgery was the cause of Romero's infection.  Second, it is uncertain whether conservative treatment would have made surgery unnecessary.  With respect to the first problem, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has suggested that, when a physician negligently exposes a patient to risk-prone surgery, the physician is liable for the harm associated with a foreseeable risk.  See Cruz Rodriguez, 13 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations at 956 (\"A treatment that submits the patient to unnecessary and foreseeable risks cannot be considered reasonable, when alternate means to reduce or avoid them are available.\").  In this case, it is undisputed that discitis was a foreseeable risk of lumbar disc surgery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the second area of uncertainty, we observe that nearly all of the experts who testified on the subject for both plaintiffs and defendants were of the opinion that conservative treatment would eliminate the need for surgery in the overwhelming majority of cases.  Nonetheless, defendants introduced expert testimony that, because Romero suffered from an \"extruded\" disc, conservative treatment would not have helped.  Dr. Udvarhelyi testified, however, that an extruded disc is indeed amenable to conservative treatment.  With competent expert testimony in the record, the jury was not left to conjure up its own theories of causation.  And certainly, the jury was free to credit some witnesses more than others.  The question is admittedly close, but the jury could have reasonably found that Dr. Borras' failure to administer conservative treatment was the \"most probable cause\" of the first operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that plaintiffs introduced legally sufficient evidence to support each element of at least one major allegation of negligence on the part of Dr. Borras.  We therefore hold that the district court properly denied the Borras Defendants' Rule 50 and Rule 59 motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>C. Negligence of Asociacion Hospital Del Maestro</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While plaintiffs made a number of allegations against the Hospital, we focus on the allegation that the failure of hospital nurses to report on each nursing shift was a negligent cause of the late detection of Romero's infection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital cannot seriously dispute that plaintiffs introduced sufficient evidence on the elements of duty and breach.  The Hospital does not contest plaintiffs' allegation that a regulation of the Puerto Rico Department of Health, in force in 1986, requires qualitative nurses' notes for each nursing shift.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Nor does the Hospital dispute the charge that, during Romero's hospital stay, the nurses attending to Romero did not supply the required notes for every shift but instead followed the Hospital's official policy of charting by exception.  The sole question, then, is whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that violation of the regulation was a proximate cause of harm to Romero.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital questions plaintiffs' proof of causation in two respects.  First, the Hospital claims that plaintiffs did not prove that the charting by exception policy was a proximate cause of the delayed detection of Romero's infection.  Second, the Hospital argues that there was no causal relationship between the belated diagnosis of the infection and any unnecessary harm suffered by Romero.  We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital essentially argues that it is uncertain whether the hospital staff observed, but failed to record, any material symptoms that would probably have led an attending physician to investigate the possibility of an infection at an earlier stage.  The Hospital notes that, even under the charting by exception policy, its nurses regularly recorded such information as the patient's temperature, vital signs, and any medication given to the patient.  Indeed, there is some evidence that Romero did not have a fever (one possible sign of infection) before May 21, when Dr. Piazza diagnosed the infection and began antibiotic treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, there was evidence from which the jury could have inferred that, as part of the practice of charting by exception, the nurses did not regularly record certain information important to the diagnosis of an infection, such as the changing characteristics of the surgical wound and the patient's complaints of post-operative pain.  Indeed, one former nurse at the Hospital who attended to Romero in 1986 testified that, under the charting by exception policy, she would not report a patient's pain if she either did not administer any medicine or simply gave the patient an aspirin-type medication (as opposed to a narcotic).  Further, since there was evidence that Romero's hospital records contained some scattered possible signs of infection that, according to Dr. Udvarhelyi, deserved further investigation (e.g., an excessively bloody bandage and local pain at the site of the wound), the jury could have reasonably inferred that intermittent charting failed to provide the sort of continuous danger signals that would be the most likely spur to early intervention by a physician.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital claims, however, that, even if faulty record-keeping is a cause of the delayed diagnosis, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a link between the timing of the diagnosis and the harm Romero eventually suffered.  Drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, it appears that Romero acquired a wound infection as early as May 17 (when a nurse noted a \"very bloody\" bandage) or May 19 (when Romero complained of pain at the site of the wound);  the wound infection then developed into discitis on or about May 20 (when Romero began experiencing excruciating back pain).  While there may have been no way to prevent the initial wound infection, the key question then becomes whether early detection and treatment of the wound infection could have prevented the infection from reaching the disc interspace in the critical period prior to May 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Udvarhelyi testified that \"time is an extremely important factor\" in handling an infection;  a 24 hour delay in treatment can make a difference;  and a delay of several days \"carries a high-risk [sic] that the infection will [not be] properly controlled.\"   Here, the jury could have reasonably inferred that diagnosis and treatment were delayed at least 24 hours (May 19 to 20), and perhaps 72 (May 17 to 20).  As a result, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the timing of the diagnosis and treatment of the wound infection was a proximate cause of Romero's discitis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, we agree with the district judge that this case \"is by no means the strongest proposition for medical malpractice against ... a hospital,\" Romero Lama, slip op. at 3.   Nevertheless, we find none of the Hospital's arguments persuasive enough to disturb the verdict.  We hold that plaintiffs met their burden of proof as to the allegation that the Hospital's substandard record-keeping procedures delayed the diagnosis and treatment of Romero's wound infection at a time when controlling the wound infection was likely to prevent the development of the more serious discitis.  Accordingly, there was no error in the district court's denial of the Hospital's Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no need to discuss defendants' other assignments of error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court denying defendants' motions for judgment as a matter of law and the Borras Defendants' motions for new trial is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition to Dr. Borras, his wife and their conjugal partnership were also named as defendants.

The Borras Defendants' attack on the denial of summary judgment has been overtaken by subsequent events, namely, a full-dress trial and an adverse jury verdict.  In these circumstances, we will not address the propriety of the denial of summary judgment.  See Whalen v. Unit Rig, Inc., 974 F.2d 1248, 1250 (10th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1417, 122 L.Ed.2d 787 (1993);  Bottineau Farmers Elevator v.

Co., 920 F.2d 429, 433 (7th Cir.1990) (addressing denial of summary judgment even after an adverse jury verdict).  Were we to consider the issue, we would find the Borras Defendants' position to be without merit.  For similar reasons, we do not separately address the district court's denial of the Borras Defendants' Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law, which is either non-appealable at this stage or resolved by our affirmance of the denial of defendants' Rule 50(b) motions.   See Locricchio, 833 F.2d at 1356 n. 2</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> First Circuit Local Rule 30.7 provides that \" '[w]henever an opinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is cited in a brief ...

Failure to follow Rule 30.7 can lead to delay while this court engages in its own translation efforts, to uncertainty about the meaning of important language, or both</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Dr. Udvarhelyi testified that \"[i]n general, when you have a relatively mild protrusion of the disk [sic] material, our policy is that you provide the patient with the possibility of a conservative treatment.\"   If Dr. Udvarhelyi's reference to \"our policy\" merely represented a personal view about what he would have done differently, his statement would not be sufficient to establish a general medical standard.  See Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 78.   The jury was free, however, to conclude that \"our policy\" referred to the policy shared by neurosurgeons, particularly where nearly all of defendants' neurosurgery experts espoused the same basic \"policy.\"   In addition, Dr. Udvarhelyi later testified, \"I couldn't see evidence that a proper time was given for the conservative management before deciding surgery.\"  (Emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Defendants argue that, even if Dr. Udvarhelyi's testimony represents the generally accepted standard, that standard does not apply to Romero's case because, according to some of the defense witnesses, Romero was suffering from neurological impairments prior to the first surgery.  Dr. Guzman, for example, claimed that Romero \"had neurological deficit from the very beginning.\"   In contrast, Dr. Udvarhelyi, who claimed that he was fully aware of all of Romero's symptoms, opined that Romero's symptoms at the time did not suggest a neurological deficit.  This was a disputed factual issue for the jury to resolve.  We cannot say that it would have been unreasonable for the jury to resolve this dispute in plaintiffs' favor</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Since we do not reach the issue of the alleged lack of proper hygiene at the hospital, we need not discuss the Hospital's argument that the district court erred in allowing Dr. Udvarhelyi, who qualified only as a neurosurgery expert and allegedly pledged not to testify against the hospital, to testify about the effect of cockroaches in the hospital on the likelihood of infection</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The regulation itself was not made part of the record on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The district judge suggested that causation was the principal issue for jury consideration when he instructed the jury that \"violation of [a] law or regulation is not in itself enough to constitute negligence absent proof of the existence of the proximate cause between the damage allegedly sustained and such alleged violation of the law and/or of the regulation.\"   Neither party objected to the jury instructions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Appellants' other arguments on appeal are moot, meritless, or waived.  First, because the denial of summary judgment is now a non-issue, see supra note 5, so is the question whether the district court, in ruling on the motion for summary judgment, failed to adhere to the local rules of the District of Puerto Rico in its treatment of allegedly uncontroverted facts.  Second, we discern no reversible error in the district court's denial of the Borras Defendants' \"informative motion\" concerning the deposition of Dr. Barth Green, a neurosurgeon who was treating Romero at the time of the trial, and who had planned to operate on Romero in 1992 in an attempt to relieve Romero's persistent back pain.  We are puzzled as to how an \"informative\" motion can be \"denied,\" particularly where leave of court would appear to be unnecessary, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(a), and no party has moved for a protective order, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c).  But even if the district court abused its discretion in curtailing discovery of relevant material, the Borras Defendants had other means of countering plaintiffs' proof of physical injury, and Romero's condition in 1992 is irrelevant to the compensable harm suffered by plaintiffs prior to 1992.  In short, the Borras Defendants have not demonstrated the \"substantial prejudice\" necessary to justify appellate intervention.  Mack v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac.  Tea, Inc., 871 F.2d 179, 186-87 (1st Cir.1989).  Third, since the Borras Defendants argued the issue of remittitur in the most perfunctory fashion on appeal, we deem waived any argument about the excessiveness of the compensatory damages.  See FDIC v. World Univ., Inc., 978 F.2d 10, 15 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\" may be deemed waived)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Dr. Nancy Alfonso, Romero's family physician, provided some treatment but then referred him to Dr. Borras, a neurosurgeon.  Dr. Borras concluded that Romero had a herniated disc and scheduled surgery.  Prior to surgery, Dr. Borras neither prescribed nor enforced a regime of absolute bed rest, nor did he offer other key components of \"conservative treatment.\"   Although Dr. Borras instructed Romero, a heavy smoker, to enter the hospital one week before surgery in order to \"clean out\" his lungs and strengthen his heart, Romero was still not subjected to standard conservative treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While operating on April 9, 1986, Dr. Borras discovered that Romero had an \"extruded\" disc and attempted to remove the extruding material.  Either because Dr. Borras failed to remove the offending material or because he operated at the wrong level, Romero's original symptoms returned in full force several days after the operation.  Dr. Borras concluded that a second operation was necessary to remedy the \"recurrence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Borras operated again on May 15, 1986.  Dr. Borras did not order pre- or post-operative antibiotics.  It is unclear whether the second operation was successful in curing the herniated disc.  In any event, as early as May 17, a nurse's note indicates that the bandage covering Romero's surgical wound was \"very bloody,\" a symptom which, according to expert testimony, indicates the possibility of infection.  On May 18, Romero was experiencing local pain at the site of the incision, another symptom consistent with an infection.  On May 19, the bandage was \"soiled again.\"   A more complete account of Romero's evolving condition is not available because the Hospital instructed nurses to engage in \"charting by exception,\" a system whereby nurses did not record qualitative observations for each of the day's three shifts, but instead made such notes only when necessary to chronicle important changes in a patient's condition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of May 20, Romero began to experience severe discomfort in his back.  He passed the night screaming in pain.  At some point on May 21, Dr. Edwin Lugo Piazza, an attending physician, diagnosed the problem as discitis--an infection of the space between discs--and responded by initiating antibiotic treatment.  Discitis is extremely painful and, since it occurs in a location with little blood circulation, very slow to cure.  Romero was hospitalized for several additional months while undergoing treatment for the infection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After moving from Puerto Rico to Florida, the Romeros filed this diversity tort action in United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Plaintiffs alleged that Dr. Borras was negligent in four general areas:  (1) failure to provide proper conservative medical treatment;  (2) premature and otherwise improper discharge after surgery;  (3) negligent performance of surgery;  and (4) failure to provide proper management for the infection.  While plaintiffs did not claim that the Hospital was vicariously liable for any negligence on the part of Dr. Borras, they alleged that the Hospital was itself negligent in two respects:  (1) failure to prepare, use, and monitor proper medical records;  and (2) failure to provide proper hygiene at the hospital premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At each appropriate moment, defendants attempted to remove the case from the jury.  Before trial they moved for summary judgment.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.  At the close of plaintiffs' case and at the close of all the evidence, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a).  After the jury returned a verdict awarding plaintiffs $600,000 in compensatory damages, defendants again sought judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b).  Additionally, the Borras Defendants requested either a new trial or remittitur.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) and 59.  At each procedural step and with respect to each allegation of negligence, defendants' primary argument was that plaintiffs had failed to establish the required elements of duty, breach, and causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rebuffed all of defendants' entreaties, ruling that the evidence was legally sufficient to fuel the jury's deliberations and ultimately to support its findings.  Because our analysis necessarily focuses on the denial of the post-verdict motions for judgment as a matter of law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we quote at length from the district court's order denying those motions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reference to Dr. Borras, the evidence, seen in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, allowed the jury to at least conclude that Dr. Borras failed to pursue a well-planned and managed, conservative treatment course for Roberto Romero Lama's back ailment before exposing him to the inherent dangers of a herniated disc operation.  Had such conservative treatment been successful, then the post-surgical complications that unfortunately took place in the operated vertebral interspace [including the infection following the second surgery] would not have occurred.  A reasonable jury could have concluded that the negligent act was the recommendation of a first operation without the benefit of additional conservative treatment....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Hospital del Maestro, it was entirely possible for the jury to conclude that the particular way in which the medical and nursing records were kept constituted evidence of carelessness in monitoring the patient after the second operation.  Perhaps the infection would have been reported and documented earlier.  Perhaps the hospital was negligent in not dealing appropriately with wound inspection and cleaning, [and] bandage changing....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romero Lama v.

We must sustain the district court's denial of a Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law, \"unless the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion, namely, that the moving party was entitled to judgment.\"  PH Group Ltd. v.

However, there is no rule that the district court must do so.  Indeed, we have noted that, where the verdict rests on substantial evidence, it is \" 'only in a very unusual case' \" that we will find that the district court abused its discretion by denying a new trial.  Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200 (quoting Hubbard, 626 F.2d at 200 and Sears v. Pauly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"246607\"><a href=\"/opinion/246607/eleonora-r-sears-v-hartmann-h-pauly-hartmann-h-pauly-v-eleonora-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir.1958)).  In other words, when an argument that the evidence was insufficient forms the basis of a motion for new trial, the district court is generally well within the bounds of its discretion in denying the motion using the same reasoning as in its denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.  See Robinson v.

Medical Malpractice under Puerto Rico Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis by laying out the substantive law of Puerto Rico governing this diversity suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  To establish a prima facie case of medical malpractice in Puerto Rico, a plaintiff must demonstrate:  (1) the basic norms of knowledge and medical care applicable to general practitioners or specialists;  (2) proof that the medical personnel failed to follow these basic norms in the treatment of the patient;  and (3) a causal relation between the act or omission of the physician and the injury suffered by the patient.  Sierra Perez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2313840\"><a href=\"/opinion/2313840/sierra-perez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Instead of simply appealing to the jury's view of what is reasonable under the circumstances, a medical malpractice plaintiff must establish the relevant national standard of care.  See Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 77.   In adopting a national standard, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico explained that physicians are required to provide \"[t]hat [level of care] which, recognizing the modern means of communication and education, ... meets the professional requirements generally acknowledged by the medical profession.\"   Oliveros v. Abreu, 101 P.R.Dec. 209, 226, 1 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations 293, 313 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Naturally, the trier of fact can rarely determine the applicable standard of care without the assistance of expert testimony.  Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 78 (citing Oliveros, 1 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations at 315).  The predictable battle of the experts then creates a curious predicament for the fact-finder, because an error of judgment regarding diagnosis or treatment does not lead to liability when expert opinion suggests that the physician's conduct fell within a range of acceptable alternatives.  See Sierra Perez, 779 F.Supp. at 643-44;  Cruz Rodriguez v. Corporacion de Servicios del Centro Medico de Puerto Rico, 113 P.R.Dec. ___, ___, 13 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations 931, 946 (1983);  Oliveros, 1 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations at 315 (holding that physician is not liable for malpractice when there is \"educated and reasonable doubt\" about the appropriate course).  While not allowed to speculate, the fact-finder is of course free to find some experts more credible than others.  See, e.g., Waffen v. United States Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475434\"><a href=\"/opinion/475434/virginia-christine-waffen-v-the-united-states-of-america-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span>, 921 (4th Cir.1986) (applying Maryland law;  noting that the fact-finder in a medical malpractice case is entitled to decide the weight and credibility of expert testimony);  Rosario v.

A plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the physician's negligent conduct was the factor that \"most probably\" caused harm to the plaintiff.  Sierra Perez, 779 F.Supp. at 643;  Cruz Rodriguez, 13 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations at 960.  \"This fact need not be established with mathematical accuracy[;]  neither must all other cause of damage be eliminated.\"   Cruz Rodriguez, 13 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations at 960-61 (citations omitted).  As in the case of duty, however, a jury normally cannot find causation based on mere speculation and conjecture;  expert testimony is generally essential.  See, e.g., Johns v. Jarrard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556750\"><a href=\"/opinion/556750/darlene-johns-and-steve-johnson-parents-of-olivia-johns-deceased-v-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span>, 557 (11th Cir.1991) (applying Georgia law;  observing that medical malpractice plaintiff must usually present expert medical testimony on issue of causation in order to get to a jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Negligence of Dr. Borras</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Borras Defendants claim that plaintiffs failed to introduce any evidence sufficient to prove either (1) the relevant standards of acceptable medical practice or (2) the causal link between Dr. Borras' conduct and harm to the plaintiffs.  While plaintiffs may not have been able to substantiate the broad attack outlined in their complaint, we focus here on only one allegation of negligence:  Dr. Borras' failure to provide conservative treatment prior to the first operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs failed to prove a general medical standard governing the need for conservative treatment in a case like that of Romero.  We disagree.  Plaintiffs' chief expert witness, Dr. George Udvarhelyi, testified that, absent an indication of neurological impairment, the standard practice is for a neurosurgeon to postpone lumbar disc surgery while the patient undergoes conservative treatment, with a period of absolute bed rest as the prime ingredient.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In these respects, the views of defendants' neurosurgery experts did not diverge from those of Dr. Udvarhelyi.  For example, Dr. Luis Guzman Lopez testified that, in the absence of extraordinary factors, \"all neurosurgeons go for [conservative treatment] before they finally decide on [an] operation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Indeed, when called by plaintiffs, Dr. Borras (who also testified as a neurosurgery expert) agreed on cross-examination with the statement that \"bed rest is normally recommended before surgery is decided in a patient like Mr. Romero,\" and claimed that he did give conservative treatment to Romero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of Dr. Borras' testimony to the contrary, there was also sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Dr. Borras failed to provide the customary conservative treatment.  Dr. Alfonso, Romero's family physician, testified that Dr. Borras, while aware that Romero had not followed a program of absolute bed rest, proceeded with surgery anyway.  Although Romero was admitted to the hospital one week before surgery, there was evidence that Dr. Borras neither prescribed nor attempted to enforce a conservative treatment regime.  In fact, there was evidence that Dr. Borras' main goal was simply to admit Romero for a week of smoke-free relaxation, not absolute bed rest, because Romero's heavy smoking and mild hypertension made him a high-risk surgery patient.  In short, we agree with the district court that the jury could reasonably have concluded that Dr. Borras failed to institute and manage a proper conservative treatment plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of causation is somewhat more problematic.  There are two potential snags in the chain of causation.  First, it is uncertain that premature surgery was the cause of Romero's infection.  Second, it is uncertain whether conservative treatment would have made surgery unnecessary.  With respect to the first problem, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has suggested that, when a physician negligently exposes a patient to risk-prone surgery, the physician is liable for the harm associated with a foreseeable risk.  See Cruz Rodriguez, 13 P.R.Sup.Ct.Off'l Translations at 956 (\"A treatment that submits the patient to unnecessary and foreseeable risks cannot be considered reasonable, when alternate means to reduce or avoid them are available.\").  In this case, it is undisputed that discitis was a foreseeable risk of lumbar disc surgery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the second area of uncertainty, we observe that nearly all of the experts who testified on the subject for both plaintiffs and defendants were of the opinion that conservative treatment would eliminate the need for surgery in the overwhelming majority of cases.  Nonetheless, defendants introduced expert testimony that, because Romero suffered from an \"extruded\" disc, conservative treatment would not have helped.  Dr. Udvarhelyi testified, however, that an extruded disc is indeed amenable to conservative treatment.  With competent expert testimony in the record, the jury was not left to conjure up its own theories of causation.  And certainly, the jury was free to credit some witnesses more than others.  The question is admittedly close, but the jury could have reasonably found that Dr. Borras' failure to administer conservative treatment was the \"most probable cause\" of the first operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that plaintiffs introduced legally sufficient evidence to support each element of at least one major allegation of negligence on the part of Dr. Borras.  We therefore hold that the district court properly denied the Borras Defendants' Rule 50 and Rule 59 motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>C. Negligence of Asociacion Hospital Del Maestro</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While plaintiffs made a number of allegations against the Hospital, we focus on the allegation that the failure of hospital nurses to report on each nursing shift was a negligent cause of the late detection of Romero's infection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital cannot seriously dispute that plaintiffs introduced sufficient evidence on the elements of duty and breach.  The Hospital does not contest plaintiffs' allegation that a regulation of the Puerto Rico Department of Health, in force in 1986, requires qualitative nurses' notes for each nursing shift.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Nor does the Hospital dispute the charge that, during Romero's hospital stay, the nurses attending to Romero did not supply the required notes for every shift but instead followed the Hospital's official policy of charting by exception.  The sole question, then, is whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that violation of the regulation was a proximate cause of harm to Romero.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital questions plaintiffs' proof of causation in two respects.  First, the Hospital claims that plaintiffs did not prove that the charting by exception policy was a proximate cause of the delayed detection of Romero's infection.  Second, the Hospital argues that there was no causal relationship between the belated diagnosis of the infection and any unnecessary harm suffered by Romero.  We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital essentially argues that it is uncertain whether the hospital staff observed, but failed to record, any material symptoms that would probably have led an attending physician to investigate the possibility of an infection at an earlier stage.  The Hospital notes that, even under the charting by exception policy, its nurses regularly recorded such information as the patient's temperature, vital signs, and any medication given to the patient.  Indeed, there is some evidence that Romero did not have a fever (one possible sign of infection) before May 21, when Dr. Piazza diagnosed the infection and began antibiotic treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, there was evidence from which the jury could have inferred that, as part of the practice of charting by exception, the nurses did not regularly record certain information important to the diagnosis of an infection, such as the changing characteristics of the surgical wound and the patient's complaints of post-operative pain.  Indeed, one former nurse at the Hospital who attended to Romero in 1986 testified that, under the charting by exception policy, she would not report a patient's pain if she either did not administer any medicine or simply gave the patient an aspirin-type medication (as opposed to a narcotic).  Further, since there was evidence that Romero's hospital records contained some scattered possible signs of infection that, according to Dr. Udvarhelyi, deserved further investigation (e.g., an excessively bloody bandage and local pain at the site of the wound), the jury could have reasonably inferred that intermittent charting failed to provide the sort of continuous danger signals that would be the most likely spur to early intervention by a physician.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital claims, however, that, even if faulty record-keeping is a cause of the delayed diagnosis, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a link between the timing of the diagnosis and the harm Romero eventually suffered.  Drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, it appears that Romero acquired a wound infection as early as May 17 (when a nurse noted a \"very bloody\" bandage) or May 19 (when Romero complained of pain at the site of the wound);  the wound infection then developed into discitis on or about May 20 (when Romero began experiencing excruciating back pain).  While there may have been no way to prevent the initial wound infection, the key question then becomes whether early detection and treatment of the wound infection could have prevented the infection from reaching the disc interspace in the critical period prior to May 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Udvarhelyi testified that \"time is an extremely important factor\" in handling an infection;  a 24 hour delay in treatment can make a difference;  and a delay of several days \"carries a high-risk [sic] that the infection will [not be] properly controlled.\"   Here, the jury could have reasonably inferred that diagnosis and treatment were delayed at least 24 hours (May 19 to 20), and perhaps 72 (May 17 to 20).  As a result, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the timing of the diagnosis and treatment of the wound infection was a proximate cause of Romero's discitis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, we agree with the district judge that this case \"is by no means the strongest proposition for medical malpractice against ... a hospital,\" Romero Lama, slip op. at 3.   Nevertheless, we find none of the Hospital's arguments persuasive enough to disturb the verdict.  We hold that plaintiffs met their burden of proof as to the allegation that the Hospital's substandard record-keeping procedures delayed the diagnosis and treatment of Romero's wound infection at a time when controlling the wound infection was likely to prevent the development of the more serious discitis.  Accordingly, there was no error in the district court's denial of the Hospital's Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no need to discuss defendants' other assignments of error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court denying defendants' motions for judgment as a matter of law and the Borras Defendants' motions for new trial is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition to Dr. Borras, his wife and their conjugal partnership were also named as defendants.

Were we to consider the issue, we would find the Borras Defendants' position to be without merit.  For similar reasons, we do not separately address the district court's denial of the Borras Defendants' Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law, which is either non-appealable at this stage or resolved by our affirmance of the denial of defendants' Rule 50(b) motions.   See Locricchio, 833 F.2d at 1356 n. 2</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> First Circuit Local Rule 30.7 provides that \" '[w]henever an opinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is cited in a brief ... [and] does not appear in the bound volumes in English, an official, certified or stipulated translation thereof with three conformed copies shall be filed.' \"  Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 77 n. 1.   As in Rolon-Alvarado, the parties to this appeal have not furnished translations of such cases.  In the future, we may commission unofficial translations and impose on the offending parties the costs incurred and, where appropriate, sanctions.  Failure to follow Rule 30.7 can lead to delay while this court engages in its own translation efforts, to uncertainty about the meaning of important language, or both</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Dr. Udvarhelyi testified that \"[i]n general, when you have a relatively mild protrusion of the disk [sic] material, our policy is that you provide the patient with the possibility of a conservative treatment.\"   If Dr. Udvarhelyi's reference to \"our policy\" merely represented a personal view about what he would have done differently, his statement would not be sufficient to establish a general medical standard.  See Rolon-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 78.   The jury was free, however, to conclude that \"our policy\" referred to the policy shared by neurosurgeons, particularly where nearly all of defendants' neurosurgery experts espoused the same basic \"policy.\"   In addition, Dr. Udvarhelyi later testified, \"I couldn't see evidence that a proper time was given for the conservative management before deciding surgery.\"  (Emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Defendants argue that, even if Dr. Udvarhelyi's testimony represents the generally accepted standard, that standard does not apply to Romero's case because, according to some of the defense witnesses, Romero was suffering from neurological impairments prior to the first surgery.  Dr. Guzman, for example, claimed that Romero \"had neurological deficit from the very beginning.\"   In contrast, Dr. Udvarhelyi, who claimed that he was fully aware of all of Romero's symptoms, opined that Romero's symptoms at the time did not suggest a neurological deficit.  This was a disputed factual issue for the jury to resolve.  We cannot say that it would have been unreasonable for the jury to resolve this dispute in plaintiffs' favor</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Since we do not reach the issue of the alleged lack of proper hygiene at the hospital, we need not discuss the Hospital's argument that the district court erred in allowing Dr. Udvarhelyi, who qualified only as a neurosurgery expert and allegedly pledged not to testify against the hospital, to testify about the effect of cockroaches in the hospital on the likelihood of infection</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The regulation itself was not made part of the record on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The district judge suggested that causation was the principal issue for jury consideration when he instructed the jury that \"violation of [a] law or regulation is not in itself enough to constitute negligence absent proof of the existence of the proximate cause between the damage allegedly sustained and such alleged violation of the law and/or of the regulation.\"   Neither party objected to the jury instructions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Appellants' other arguments on appeal are moot, meritless, or waived.  First, because the denial of summary judgment is now a non-issue, see supra note 5, so is the question whether the district court, in ruling on the motion for summary judgment, failed to adhere to the local rules of the District of Puerto Rico in its treatment of allegedly uncontroverted facts.  Second, we discern no reversible error in the district court's denial of the Borras Defendants' \"informative motion\" concerning the deposition of Dr. Barth Green, a neurosurgeon who was treating Romero at the time of the trial, and who had planned to operate on Romero in 1992 in an attempt to relieve Romero's persistent back pain.  We are puzzled as to how an \"informative\" motion can be \"denied,\" particularly where leave of court would appear to be unnecessary, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(a), and no party has moved for a protective order, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c).  But even if the district court abused its discretion in curtailing discovery of relevant material, the Borras Defendants had other means of countering plaintiffs' proof of physical injury, and Romero's condition in 1992 is irrelevant to the compensable harm suffered by plaintiffs prior to 1992.  In short, the Borras Defendants have not demonstrated the \"substantial prejudice\" necessary to justify appellate intervention.  Mack v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac.  Tea, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520577\"><a href=\"/opinion/520577/thomasina-mack-v-the-great-atlantic-and-pacific-tea-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 186-87 (1st Cir.1989).  Third, since the Borras Defendants argued the issue of remittitur in the most perfunctory fashion on appeal, we deem waived any argument about the excessiveness of the compensatory damages.  See FDIC v. World Univ., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593291\"><a href=\"/opinion/593291/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-world-university-inc-santa/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\" may be deemed waived)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
