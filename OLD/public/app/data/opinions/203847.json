Scadron, Assistant Director, and Kathryn L.\nDeangelis, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, were\non brief, for respondent.\n\n\n                           June 1, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n     Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric.\nH. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey as respondent.\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.         Petitioner Jolanta Burbiene seeks\n\nreview of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\ndenying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n\n(\"CAT\").   Burbiene (\"petitioner\") filed an application for asylum\n\non   behalf    of   herself      and   her   daughter,    Agniete    Burbaite\n\n(\"Agniete\"). The petition identified Arvydas Burba (\"Arvydas\"), as\n\nher husband.    Petitioner and her family are citizens of Lithuania,\n\nand petitioner claimed eligibility for asylum based on her fear\n\nthat she or her daughter could fall victim to human trafficking in\n\nthe sex trade if they returned to Lithuania.\n\n           The BIA rejected petitioner's claim on the ground that\n\nshe had failed to meet her burden of proving a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution in Lithuania. There was no attempt to establish\n\npast persecution.     Affirming the decision of an Immigration Judge\n\n(\"IJ\"), the BIA concluded that petitioner failed to establish that\n\nthe risk of being forced into prostitution in Lithuania results\n\nfrom either government action, government-supported action, or\n\nprivate conduct that the government is unwilling or unable to\n\ncontrol.      The   BIA   also   found   that   the   petitioner    failed   to\n\nestablish membership in a particular social group for purposes of\n\nasylum and withholding of removal.\n\n           After review of the record, we deny the petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f                                          I.\n\n               Petitioner and her family entered the United States on\n\nAugust 20, 2001 on a tourist visa that gave them permission to\n\nremain until February 19, 2002.                 On August 14, 2002, petitioner\n\nfiled an application for asylum which listed Arvydas as her spouse\n\nand Agniete, their daughter, as a derivative beneficiary.1                       As a\n\nbasis for the asylum claim, petitioner cited fear that she or\n\nAgniete would be abducted and forced into prostitution if they\n\nreturned to Lithuania.          She submitted documentation to support her\n\napplication, including Country Reports on Lithuania issued by the\n\nUnited States Department of State.\n\n               On May 7, 2004 the family members were each served with\n\nNotices       To   Appear     in   Immigration      Court    and     charged     with\n\nremoveability because they had remained in the United States longer\n\nthan       permitted,    in   violation    of    section    237(a)(1)(b)    of     the\n\nImmigration        and   Nationality      Act    (\"INA\").      See    8   U.S.C.    §\n\n1227(a)(1)(B). They conceded removeability, but petitioner renewed\n\nher application for asylum for herself and for her daughter.\n\n\n       1\n       Petitioner only checked the box requesting the family member\n\"be included in this application\" for Agniete, and not for Arvydas.\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A) (\"A spouse or child . . . of an alien\nwho is granted asylum under this subsection may, if not otherwise\neligible for asylum under this section, be granted the same status\nas the alien if accompanying, or following to join, such alien.\").\nThe IJ and BIA appear to have considered the application as if it\nincluded the entire family, although the record provides no\nindication that the application was ever amended to include\nArvydas. We will also refer to the application as applying to the\nwhole family.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f                 On June 2, 2006, an IJ conducted a hearing on the merits\n\nof petitioner's application.                 Petitioner testified that shortly\n\nafter the family arrived in the United States in 2001, they learned\n\nthat Tovilla, a friend of Agniete, had been kidnaped in Lithuania\n\nand almost sold into prostitution.                 After the kidnaping, Tovilla's\n\nparents had asked the Lithuanian police and the media for help.\n\nTovilla was found five days later near the Polish border and\n\nreturned to her family.2               Petitioner also testified that in 1998\n\nher cousin, Inga, had been kidnaped and forced into prostitution\n\nafter responding to an advertisement requesting childcare providers\n\nto   work        in    Germany.        She   was   later    arrested    in   a    German\n\nprostitution           raid    and   returned      to   Lithuania.      According     to\n\npetitioner, Inga did not report her experience to the police\n\nbecause she was ashamed and because \"even if she went to the\n\npolice, they certainly wouldn't have . . . looked for [the man\n\nresponsible], let alone arrest him.\"                      Petitioner testified that\n\nInga       had    refused      to    write   a   letter    to   support   her     asylum\n\napplication because she was ashamed, and that Tovilla's mother also\n\ndeclined to write such a letter.\n\n                 The    IJ    denied   petitioner's       application     for    asylum.\n\nAlthough the judge found petitioner credible, he determined that\n\nshe is ineligible for asylum because human trafficking in Lithuania\n\n\n       2\n      According to petitioner's testimony, \"a certain woman\" found\nTovilla. It is unclear who this woman is or whether she was\naffiliated with the government or any other group.\n\n                                             -4-\n\fis   not   the   result   of   government   action,   government-supported\n\naction, or the government's unwillingness or inability to control\n\nprivate conduct, and therefore does not amount to persecution under\n\nthe INA. The judge disagreed with her claim that Lithuanian police\n\nare unwilling to help trafficking victims, finding it unsupported\n\nby the country reports submitted in support of her application for\n\nasylum.\n\n            The IJ also found that petitioner failed to meet her\n\nburden of establishing that the feared persecution would be on\n\naccount of \"membership in a particular social group.\"          8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(b)(1)(B)(i).     The IJ noted that petitioner \"considers herself\n\nrather to be beyond the age of kidnaping and forced prostitution,\n\nbut she considers her daughter to be a prime subject.\"3          The judge\n\n\n      3\n       Petitioner does not concede in her brief that she is not part\nof the \"particular social group\" that she claims is persecuted.\nHowever, to the extent she seeks to claim asylum for herself on the\nbasis of fear that her daughter will be persecuted, it is not clear\nwhether such a claim is viable. See, e.g., Kechichian v. Mukasey,\n535 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"This circuit has not considered\na parent's claim of psychological harm based solely on a child's\npotential persecution, but the BIA has foreclosed such claims.\");\nTchoukhrova v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1222, 1223 (9th. Cir.\n2005)(Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)\n(\"By allowing the harms suffered by a child to be imputed to the\nparent, the panel in effect creates a reverse derivative asylum\nclaim -- something expressly barred by 8 C.F.R. § 207.7(b)(6),\nwhich provides that '[t]he following relatives of refugees are\nineligible for accompanying or following-to-join benefits . . . [a]\nparent, sister, brother . . . .'\"). But see Tchoukhrova v.\nGonzales, 404 F.3d 1181, 1190 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that harms\nsuffered by a child may be imputed to parents who seek asylum),\nvacated and remanded, 549 U.S. 2006. The parties have not fully\nbriefed this important question, which we need not reach because of\nour conclusion that petitioner cannot establish a well-founded fear\n\n                                     -5-\n\ffound that the alleged social group, which he described as \"women\n\nand children in Lithuania who are under 40 years of age, and who\n\nfear being kidnaped by criminals,\" was not a recognizable social\n\ngroup for purposes of the INA as the statute has been interpreted\n\nby the BIA.    See In re Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 214 (BIA 1985);\n\nIn re    C-A-, 23 I. & N. Dec. 951, 955 (BIA 2006).\n\n             On March 18, 2008, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision and\n\ndismissed the appeal, agreeing that petitioner failed to meet her\n\nburden of establishing a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of membership in a particular social group.                  The BIA\n\nendorsed the IJ's finding that respondents feared criminal, not\n\ngovernmental, activity.       It noted that while human trafficking in\n\nLithuania is undoubtedly a \"serious concern,\" the IJ's conclusion\n\nthat    it   does   not   amount   to   persecution   on   the   basis   of   a\n\nstatutorily protected ground \"properly reflects our immigration\n\nlaws.\"   The BIA added that petitioner did not establish membership\n\nin a particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding\n\nof removal, citing the Sixth Circuit's decision in Rreshpja v.\n\nGonzales, 420 F.3d 551, 556 (6th Cir. 2005), which held that young,\n\nattractive Albanian women who fear being kidnaped and forced into\n\nprostitution do not constitute a particular social group for asylum\n\npurposes.     See id. (\"A social group may not be circularly defined\n\n\n\nof future persecution resulting from government action or inaction\nfor any member of the family.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fby the fact that it suffers persecution.      The individuals in the\n\ngroup must share a narrowing characteristic other than their risk\n\nof being persecuted.\").   Burbiene petitioned for review of the BIA\n\norder.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          To qualify for asylum on the basis of a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution, an applicant must prove that she has a well-\n\nfounded fear that if she returns to her home country she will be\n\npersecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in\n\na particular social group, or political opinion.      8 U.S.C. §§ 1101\n\n(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).    Her fear must be both subjectively\n\nreal and objectively reasonable.    Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).    \"Where, as here, 'the BIA adopted and affirmed\n\nthe IJ's ruling, but also discussed some of the bases for the IJ's\n\nopinion, we review both the IJ's and BIA's opinions.'\"          Lin v.\n\nGonzales, 503 F.3d 4, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Zheng v.\n\nGonzales, 475 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2007)).       We apply the highly\n\ndeferential substantial evidence standard to the agency's factual\n\ndeterminations,    considering   \"whether   the   agency's   ruling   is\n\nsupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the\n\nrecord considered as a whole.\"     Wang v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 80, 83-\n\n84 (1st Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nWe review the BIA's legal determinations de novo, id. at 83,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\falthough we give some deference to its interpretations of the INA,\n\nSilva, 394 F.3d at 5.\n\n            Under       the    INA,      persecution        \"always    implies     some\n\nconnection      to     governmental       action    or   inaction,     related     to   a\n\nprotected ground.\"           Orelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).      A    petitioner       bears    the     burden    of   establishing     this\n\nnecessary       link    between    persecution       and     government      action     or\n\ninaction.       See id. at 70.            Country Reports for Lithuania, and\n\npetitioner's own concessions in her brief, support the agency's\n\nconclusion that human trafficking in Lithuania is committed by a\n\ncriminal element.            Such criminal activity could only amount to\n\npersecution under the INA if petitioner can show that either: 1) it\n\nis committed by people aligned with the government, or 2) the\n\ngovernment is unwilling or unable to control it.                          See Raza v.\n\nGonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir. 2007).                  Here, only the second\n\nprong is at issue, because petitioner does not argue that the\n\ngovernment is aligned with the kidnapers.                   Scattered incidences of\n\nviolence    or       harassment    are     not     enough    to   establish      that   a\n\ngovernment is unwilling or unable to control violence; \"[b]y\n\ndefinition, persecution has a systematic aspect.\"                      Id.\n\n            Although petitioner argues that Lithuania is unable or\n\nunwilling to control the problem of human trafficking, \"reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence\" supports the IJ's conclusion\n\nthat     Lithuania      is     \"making     every     effort       to   combat\"    human\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\ftrafficking, \"a difficult task not only for the government of\n\nLithuania, but for any government in the world.\"                   The Country\n\nReport for 2005 mentions legislative changes enacted that year to\n\nstrengthen   the    government's      response   to     trafficking,   such   as\n\nincreased criminal sentences for traffickers. It also reports that\n\nin 2005 a joint government task force uncovered an organized crime\n\nring that had transported nearly 100 young girls and women to work\n\nin the sex trade in England, and that during that year the\n\ngovernment opened 24 criminal cases against alleged traffickers.\n\nFurthermore, according to the report, the government provided\n\nfunding for fifteen \"day centers\" to assist victims of trafficking\n\nand gave grants to thirteen non-governmental organizations that\n\nsimilarly serve trafficking victims.\n\n           It is true that Lithuania has not been able to completely\n\neradicate the problem of human trafficking within its borders, and\n\nthat the problem persists despite what the Country Report described\n\nas \"significant efforts\" by the government.                 Nonetheless, the\n\nrecord does not indicate that Lithuania's inability to stop the\n\nproblem is distinguishable from any other government's struggles to\n\ncombat a criminal element. Lithuania has experienced both setbacks\n\nand   successes    in   its   fight   against    this    crime.4    But   these\n\n\n      4\n       At oral argument, there was disagreement over the number of\nwomen actually trafficked in Lithuania each year. The IJ observed\nthat Lithuanian police \"determined that nine women, including one\nminor, were victims of human trafficking\" in 2005.      Petitioner\nnoted the inconsistency between that determination and the Country\n\n                                      -9-\n\fcircumstances do not subject the victims of human trafficking to\n\n\"persecution\" under the INA.\n\n          Because the facts do not establish a nexus between the\n\npetitioner's    fear   of   harm   and   the   government   of   Lithuania,\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that petitioner\n\nfailed to establish the well-founded fear of persecution required\n\nfor asylum.      As this is an independent ground to reject her\n\npetition, we do not reach the question of whether she established\n\n\"membership in a particular social group\" to qualify as a refugee\n\nunder the INA.\n\n          We therefore reject the petition for review of the\n\nasylum claim.    Consequently, we also reject the petition to review\n\nthe claim for withholding of removal, which has a more demanding\n\nstandard of proof and obligates a petitioner to show a \"clear\n\nprobability of persecution\" if returned to her home country.\n\nI.N.S. v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 413 (1984).          We likewise dismiss\n\nthe petition for review of the CAT claim.         See Santosa, 528 F.3d,\n\n88, 92 n.1 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"The standard for withholding of\n\nremoval is more stringent than that for asylum.        The CAT standard,\n\n\nReport's statement that the Lithuanian government estimated that\n1,000 to 1,500 women were trafficked, presumably also in 2005. We\nnote that the IJ's chosen figure was also taken from the same\nCountry Report, and that it was petitioner herself who submitted,\nby way of the Country Report, the figure chosen by the IJ. Either\nway, substantial evidence supports the IJ's conclusion that the\nLithuanian government was neither responsible for the trafficking\nnor unable or unwilling to control it to an extent that would\nconstitute \"persecution\" under the INA.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fin turn, is more stringent than that for withholding of removal.\"\n\n(citations omitted)).           Protection under the CAT requires an alien\n\nto show \"that it is more likely than not that he or she would be\n\ntortured,\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2), \"by or at the instigation of or\n\nwith       the   consent   or   acquiescence   of   a   public   official,\"   id.\n\n§ 208.18(a)(1).5           As we have stated, there is no evidence of\n\ngovernment consent or acquiescence in the human trafficking problem\n\nin Lithuania.\n\n\n\nThe petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n       Because we do not grant withholding of removal or relief\nunder CAT to the petitioner, it is not necessary for us to consider\nwhether a derivative benefit could apply to her family on those\nclaims, an issue not raised by either party. We have previously\nnoted that there can be no derivative beneficiaries of a grant of\nwithholding of removal. Kechichian, 535 F.3d at 22 n.4 (noting\nthat the withholding of removal statute \"does not permit derivative\nwithholding of removal under any circumstances.\" (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)). The Eleventh Circuit has\nheld that \"there are no derivative benefits associated with a grant\nof withholding of removal because, unlike the asylum statute, the\nwithholding statute contains no mention of derivative rights. The\nCAT regulation likewise contains no mention of derivative rights;\nit limits the applicant and seemingly forecloses a derivative\nclaim.\"    Martinez v. U.S. Att'y Gen., No. 08-14398, 2009 WL\n1109294, at *3 (11th Cir. 2009); see also Delgado v. U.S. Att'y\nGen., 487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir. 2007) (\"[T]here are no\nderivative benefits associated with a grant of withholding of\nremoval.\")\n\n                                       -11-\n\f",

She submitted documentation to support her application, including Country Reports on Lithuania issued by the United States Department of State.</p>\n<p>On May 7, 2004 the family members were each served with Notices To Appear in Immigration Court and charged with removeability because they had remained in the United States longer than permitted, in violation of section 237(a)(1)(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). They conceded removeability, but petitioner renewed her application for asylum for herself and for her daughter.</p>\n<p>On June 2, 2006, an IJ conducted a hearing on the merits of petitioner's application. Petitioner testified that shortly after the family arrived in the United States in 2001, they learned that Tovilla, a friend of Agniete, had been kidnaped in Lithuania and almost sold into prostitution. After the kidnaping, Tovilla's parents had asked the Lithuanian police and the media for help. Tovilla was found five days later near the Polish border and returned to her family.<sup>[2]</sup> Petitioner also testified that in 1998 her cousin, Inga, had been kidnaped and forced into prostitution after responding to an advertisement requesting childcare providers to work in Germany. She was later arrested in a German prostitution raid and returned to Lithuania. According to petitioner, Inga did not report her experience to the police because she was ashamed and because \"even if she went to the police, they certainly wouldn't have ... looked for [the man responsible], let alone arrest him.\" Petitioner testified that Inga had refused to write a letter to support her asylum application because she was ashamed, and that Tovilla's mother also declined to write such a letter.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied petitioner's application for asylum. Although the judge found petitioner credible, he determined that she is ineligible for asylum because human trafficking in Lithuania is not the result of government action, government-supported action, or the government's unwillingness or inability to control private conduct, and therefore does not amount to persecution under the INA. The judge disagreed with her claim that Lithuanian police are unwilling to help trafficking victims, finding it unsupported by the country reports submitted in support of her application for asylum.</p>\n<p>The IJ also found that petitioner failed to meet her burden of establishing that the feared persecution would be on account of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*254</span> \"membership in a particular social group.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). The IJ noted that petitioner \"considers herself rather to be beyond the age of kidnaping and forced prostitution, but she considers her daughter to be a prime subject.\"<sup>[3]</sup> The judge found that the alleged social group, which he described as \"women and children in Lithuania who are under 40 years of age, and who fear being kidnaped by criminals,\" was not a recognizable social group for purposes of the INA as the statute has been interpreted by the BIA. <i>See </i><i>In re Acosta,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 214 (BIA 1985); <i>In re C-A-,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 951, 955 (BIA 2006).</p>\n<p>On March 18, 2008, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision and dismissed the appeal, agreeing that petitioner failed to meet her burden of establishing a well-founded fear of persecution on account of membership in a particular social group. The BIA endorsed the IJ's finding that respondents feared criminal, not governmental, activity. It noted that while human trafficking in Lithuania is undoubtedly a \"serious concern,\" the IJ's conclusion that it does not amount to persecution on the basis of a statutorily protected ground \"properly reflects our immigration laws.\" The BIA added that petitioner did not establish membership in a particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal, citing the Sixth Circuit's decision in <i>Rreshpja v. Gonzales,</i> 420 F.3d 551, 556 (6th Cir.2005), which held that young, attractive Albanian women who fear being kidnaped and forced into prostitution do not constitute a particular social group for asylum purposes. <i>See id.</i> (\"A social group may not be circularly defined by the fact that it suffers persecution. The individuals in the group must share a narrowing characteristic other than their risk of being persecuted.\"). Burbiene petitioned for review of the BIA order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>To qualify for asylum on the basis of a well-founded fear of future persecution, an applicant must prove that she has a well-founded fear that if she returns to her home country she will be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). Her fear must be both subjectively real and objectively reasonable. <i>Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005). \"Where, as here, `the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling, but also discussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we review both the IJ's and BIA's opinions.'\" <i>Lin v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*255</span> 503 F.3d 4, 6-7 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> 475 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.2007)). We apply the highly deferential substantial evidence standard to the agency's factual determinations, considering \"whether the agency's ruling is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Wang v. Mukasey,</i> 508 F.3d 80, 83-84 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We review the BIA's legal determinations de novo, <i>id.</i> at 83, although we give some deference to its interpretations of the INA, <i>Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 5.</p>\n<p>Under the INA, persecution \"always implies some connection to governmental action or inaction, related to a protected ground.\" <i>Orelien v. Gonzales,</i> 467 F.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir.2006). A petitioner bears the burden of establishing this necessary link between persecution and government action or inaction. <i>See id.</i> at 70. Country Reports for Lithuania, and petitioner's own concessions in her brief, support the agency's conclusion that human trafficking in Lithuania is committed by a criminal element. Such criminal activity could only amount to persecution under the INA if petitioner can show that either: 1) it is committed by people aligned with the government, or 2) the government is unwilling or unable to control it. <i>See </i><i>Raza v. Gonzales,</i> 484 F.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir. 2007). Here, only the second prong is at issue, because petitioner does not argue that the government is aligned with the kidnappers. Scattered incidences of violence or harassment are not enough to establish that a government is unwilling or unable to control violence; \"[b]y definition, persecution has a systematic aspect.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Although petitioner argues that Lithuania is unable or unwilling to control the problem of human trafficking, \"reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence\" supports the IJ's conclusion that Lithuania is \"making every effort to combat\" human trafficking, \"a difficult task not only for the government of Lithuania, but for any government in the world.\" The Country Report for 2005 mentions legislative changes enacted that year to strengthen the government's response to trafficking, such as increased criminal sentences for traffickers. It also reports that in 2005 a joint government task force uncovered an organized crime ring that had transported nearly 100 young girls and women to work in the sex trade in England, and that during that year the government opened 24 criminal cases against alleged traffickers. Furthermore, according to the report, the government provided funding for fifteen \"day centers\" to assist victims of trafficking and gave grants to thirteen non-governmental organizations that similarly serve trafficking victims.</p>\n<p>It is true that Lithuania has not been able to completely eradicate the problem of human trafficking within its borders, and that the problem persists despite what the Country Report described as \"significant efforts\" by the government. Nonetheless, the record does not indicate that Lithuania's inability to stop the problem is distinguishable from any other government's struggles to combat a criminal element. Lithuania has experienced both setbacks and successes in its fight against this crime.<sup>[4]</sup> But these circumstances do <span class=\"star-pagination\">*256</span> not subject the victims of human trafficking to \"persecution\" under the INA.</p>\n<p>Because the facts do not establish a nexus between the petitioner's fear of harm and the government of Lithuania, substantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that petitioner failed to establish the well-founded fear of persecution required for asylum. As this is an independent ground to reject her petition, we do not reach the question of whether she established \"membership in a particular social group\" to qualify as a refugee under the INA.</p>\n<p>We therefore reject the petition for review of the asylum claim. Consequently, we also reject the petition to review the claim for withholding of removal, which has a more demanding standard of proof and obligates a petitioner to show a \"clear probability of persecution\" if returned to her home country. <i>I.N.S. v. Stevic,</i> 467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). We likewise dismiss the petition for review of the CAT claim. <i>See Santosa,</i> 528 F.3d, 88, 92 n. 1 (1st Cir.2008) (\"The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for asylum. The CAT standard, in turn, is more stringent than that for withholding of removal.\" (citations omitted)). Protection under the CAT requires an alien to show \"that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured,\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2), \"by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official,\" <i>id.</i> § 208.18(a)(1).<sup>[5]</sup> As we have stated, there is no evidence of government consent or acquiescence in the human trafficking problem in Lithuania.</p>\n<p><i>The petition for review is denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric. H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey as respondent.</p>\n<p>[1]  Petitioner only checked the box requesting the family member \"be included in this application\" for Agniete, and not for Arvydas. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A) (\"A spouse or child ... of an alien who is granted asylum under this subsection may, if not otherwise eligible for asylum under this section, be granted the same status as the alien if accompanying, or following to join, such alien.\"). The IJ and BIA appear to have considered the application as if it included the entire family, although the record provides no indication that the application was ever amended to include Arvydas. We will also refer to the application as applying to the whole family.</p>\n<p>[2]  According to petitioner's testimony, \"a certain woman\" found Tovilla. It is unclear who this woman is or whether she was affiliated with the government or any other group.</p>\n<p>[3]  Petitioner does not concede in her brief that she is not part of the \"particular social group\" that she claims is persecuted. However, to the extent she seeks to claim asylum for herself on the basis of fear that her daughter will be persecuted, it is not clear whether such a claim is viable. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kechichian v. Mukasey,</i> 535 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir.2008) (\"This circuit has not considered a parent's claim of psychological harm based solely on a child's potential persecution, but the BIA has foreclosed such claims.\"); <i>Tchoukhrova v. Gonzales,</i> 430 F.3d 1222, 1223 (9th. Cir.2005)(Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (\"By allowing the harms suffered by a child to be imputed to the parent, the panel in effect creates a reverse derivative asylum claim-something expressly barred by 8 C.F.R. § 207.7(b)(6), which provides that `[t]he following relatives of refugees are ineligible for accompanying or following-to-join benefits ... [a] <i>parent,</i> sister, brother....'\"). <i>But see </i><i>Tchoukhrova v. Gonzales,</i> 404 F.3d 1181, 1190 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that harms suffered by a child may be imputed to parents who seek asylum), <i>vacated and remanded,</i> 549 U.S. 801, 127 S.Ct. 57, 166 L.Ed.2d 7 (2006). The parties have not fully briefed this important question, which we need not reach because of our conclusion that petitioner cannot establish a well-founded fear of future persecution resulting from government action or inaction for any member of the family.</p>\n<p>[4]  At oral argument, there was disagreement over the number of women actually trafficked in Lithuania each year. The IJ observed that Lithuanian police \"determined that nine women, including one minor, were victims of human trafficking\" in 2005. Petitioner noted the inconsistency between that determination and the Country Report's statement that the Lithuanian government estimated that 1,000 to 1,500 women were trafficked, presumably also in 2005. We note that the IJ's chosen figure was also taken from the same Country Report, and that it was petitioner herself who submitted, by way of the Country Report, the figure chosen by the IJ. Either way, substantial evidence supports the IJ's conclusion that the Lithuanian government was neither responsible for the trafficking nor unable or unwilling to control it to an extent that would constitute \"persecution\" under the INA.</p>\n<p>[5]  Because we do not grant withholding of removal or relief under CAT to the petitioner, it is not necessary for us to consider whether a derivative benefit could apply to her family on those claims, an issue not raised by either party. We have previously noted that there can be no derivative beneficiaries of a grant of withholding of removal. <i>Kechichian,</i> 535 F.3d at 22 n. 4 (noting that the withholding of removal statute \"does not permit derivative withholding of removal under any circumstances.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The Eleventh Circuit has held that \"there are no derivative benefits associated with a grant of withholding of removal because, unlike the asylum statute, the withholding statute contains no mention of derivative rights. The CAT regulation likewise contains no mention of derivative rights; it limits the applicant and seemingly forecloses a derivative claim.\" <i>Martinez v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,</i> No. 08-14398, 2009 WL 1109294, at *3 (11th Cir.2009); <i>see also </i><i>Delgado v.

There was no attempt to establish past persecution.

Mukasey as respondent.</p>\n<p>[1]  Petitioner only checked the box requesting the family member \"be included in this application\" for Agniete, and not for Arvydas. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A) (\"A spouse or child ... of an alien who is granted asylum under this subsection may, if not otherwise eligible for asylum under this section, be granted the same status as the alien if accompanying, or following to join, such alien.\"). The IJ and BIA appear to have considered the application as if it included the entire family, although the record provides no indication that the application was ever amended to include Arvydas. We will also refer to the application as applying to the whole family.</p>\n<p>[2]  According to petitioner's testimony, \"a certain woman\" found Tovilla. It is unclear who this woman is or whether she was affiliated with the government or any other group.</p>\n<p>[3]  Petitioner does not concede in her brief that she is not part of the \"particular social group\" that she claims is persecuted. However, to the extent she seeks to claim asylum for herself on the basis of fear that her daughter will be persecuted, it is not clear whether such a claim is viable. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kechichian v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203402\"><a href=\"/opinion/203402/kechichian-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2008) (\"This circuit has not considered a parent's claim of psychological harm based solely on a child's potential persecution, but the BIA has foreclosed such claims.\"); <i>Tchoukhrova v.

Cir.2005)(Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (\"By allowing the harms suffered by a child to be imputed to the parent, the panel in effect creates a reverse derivative asylum claim-something expressly barred by 8 C.F.R. § 207.7(b)(6), which provides that `[t]he following relatives of refugees are ineligible for accompanying or following-to-join benefits ... [a] <i>parent,</i> sister, brother....'\"). <i>But see </i><i>Tchoukhrova v.

The parties have not fully briefed this important question, which we need not reach because of our conclusion that petitioner cannot establish a well-founded fear of future persecution resulting from government action or inaction for any member of the family.</p>\n<p>[4]  At oral argument, there was disagreement over the number of women actually trafficked in Lithuania each year. The IJ observed that Lithuanian police \"determined that nine women, including one minor, were victims of human trafficking\" in 2005. Petitioner noted the inconsistency between that determination and the Country Report's statement that the Lithuanian government estimated that 1,000 to 1,500 women were trafficked, presumably also in 2005. We note that the IJ's chosen figure was also taken from the same Country Report, and that it was petitioner herself who submitted, by way of the Country Report, the figure chosen by the IJ. Either way, substantial evidence supports the IJ's conclusion that the Lithuanian government was neither responsible for the trafficking nor unable or unwilling to control it to an extent that would constitute \"persecution\" under the INA.</p>\n<p>[5]  Because we do not grant withholding of removal or relief under CAT to the petitioner, it is not necessary for us to consider whether a derivative benefit could apply to her family on those claims, an issue not raised by either party. We have previously noted that there can be no derivative beneficiaries of a grant of withholding of removal. <i>Kechichian,</i> 535 F.3d at 22 n. 4 (noting that the withholding of removal statute \"does not permit derivative withholding of removal under any circumstances.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The Eleventh Circuit has held that \"there are no derivative benefits associated with a grant of withholding of removal because, unlike the asylum statute, the withholding statute contains no mention of derivative rights. The CAT regulation likewise contains no mention of derivative rights; it limits the applicant and seemingly forecloses a derivative claim.\" <i>Martinez v.
