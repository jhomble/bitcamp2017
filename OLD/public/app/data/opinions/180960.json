Appellant Ohifuemeh Peter Ayewoh\n\n(\"Ayewoh\")   was   convicted     of   bank      fraud   in   the   United    States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico.                On appeal Ayewoh\n\ncontends that the government provided insufficient evidence that\n\nthe defrauded bank, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (\"BPPR\"), was\n\ninsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") at\n\nthe time of the crimes; that Ayewoh knowingly defrauded BPPR; or\n\nthat Ayewoh made misrepresentations to BPPR.                       Ayewoh further\n\ncontends that the prosecutor violated his Fifth Amendment rights by\n\nreferring    to   his    decision   not    to   testify.      We    reject    these\n\ncontentions and affirm Ayewoh's conviction and sentence.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            In 2005, Ayewoh established OIPA, Inc., as a for profit\n\ncorporation in Puerto Rico to provide inspection services at public\n\nhousing projects for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment (\"HUD\").       Ayewoh was the President of the corporation,\n\nand his wife was the Secretary.           In OIPA's name, Ayewoh acquired a\n\ncredit card point-of-sale device (\"POS device\") and a merchant's\n\naccount at BPPR.        A POS device allows a merchant to accept credit\n\ncard payments either electronically (by swiping a card's magnetic\n\nstrip through the device) or manually (by entering a card's number\n\nwith a keypad).1        HUD's method of payment for OIPA's inspection\n\n\n     1\n       Ayewoh himself notes that,\n          [i]n a manual transaction the card is not present.\n     The merchant will key in an account number that a person\n\n                                      -2-\n\fservices included providing Ayewoh with a credit card number and\n\nauthorizing him to perform manual transactions.             However, the\n\ngovernment presented evidence at trial that Ayewoh used the POS\n\ndevice to execute numerous unauthorized manual transactions using\n\nother credit card numbers, many of which belonged to cards issued\n\nby foreign banks.    The defense's theory was that Ayewoh innocently\n\nbelieved that the credit card charges made to the POS device were\n\nauthorized by the cardholders as legitimate investments in a new\n\nreal   estate   venture.   In   order   to   understand   the   respective\n\ntheories, some understanding of industry practice and Ayewoh's own\n\nactivities is required.\n\n           When a credit card transaction executed on a POS device\n\nis accepted by the bank that issued the card (\"issuing bank\"), the\n\npayment is deposited directly into the merchant's bank account (at\n\nthe \"acquiring bank\").     In the event that a cardholder disputes a\n\ntransaction, contractual agreements with credit card providers such\n\nas Visa and MasterCard permit the issuing bank to initiate a\n\n\"chargeback\" whereby the acquiring bank is liable to the issuing\n\nbank for the full amount of the disputed charge.           The acquiring\n\nbank, in turn, looks to the merchant for reimbursement.\n\n\n\n\n     has given him and the transaction will be        deposited in\n     the merchant's account. It is considered          a high risk\n     transaction, as there is no magnetic strip       reading such\n     as occurs when a plastic card is swiped or       a signature.\nAppellant's Br. 9 n.1.\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            Ayewoh was the only person with access to OIPA's POS\n\ndevice.     For   several    months,   Ayewoh,    using   the   POS   device,\n\nprocessed relatively small charges, with monthly totals ranging\n\nfrom $1,045 in February 2006, to $9,135 in March 2006.           However, in\n\nApril 2006, OIPA's account received $113,070 in payments from at\n\nleast sixteen different credit cards.              BPPR's records showed\n\nnumerous instances in which OIPA's POS device attempted to run a\n\nlarge transaction, which was declined, and then it immediately\n\nattempted several additional transactions with the same credit card\n\nfor progressively smaller amounts.         Upon detecting this suspicious\n\nactivity, BPPR froze OIPA's account and sent investigators to\n\nquestion Ayewoh.       When asked how he obtained the credit card\n\nnumbers at issue, Ayewoh claimed he received a list of numbers from\n\na \"friend of a friend\" in Europe who wanted to invest in a new\n\nhousing development project Ayewoh had planned for OIPA.              Though\n\nrepeatedly asked, Ayewoh declined to provide information about the\n\nproject and stated that he did not know the identity of the alleged\n\ninvestor.\n\n            Soon thereafter the banks that issued the credit cards in\n\nquestion began notifying BPPR that Ayewoh's March and April charges\n\nwere   unauthorized.        BPPR   subsequently    returned     $122,104   in\n\nchargebacks to the issuing banks.          Of this $122,104, BPPR was only\n\nable to recover about $100,000 from Ayewoh, who had withdrawn large\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\famounts before his account was frozen.   BPPR suffered a net loss of\n\n$19,644.\n\n           Ayewoh was indicted by a grand jury in November 2007 on\n\none count of bank fraud, charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344,\n\nand one forfeiture count, charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n981(a)(1)(C) and 982(a)(2).   After a jury trial in October 2008,\n\nAyewoh was convicted and sentenced to thirty months in prison to be\n\nfollowed by five years of supervised release.       He was further\n\nordered to pay restitution to BPPR in the amount of its losses.\n\nAyewoh timely appealed.\n\n                                II.\n\n           Ayewoh does not dispute that the evidence established\n\nthat he made unauthorized charges to the credit cards at issue.\n\nHowever, Ayewoh contends on appeal that the government failed to\n\nprove all of the essential elements of the bank fraud offense.   See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1344.    Specifically, he claims that the government\n\nfailed to present sufficient evidence to permit a rational jury to\n\nfind beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that BPPR was insured by the\n\nFDIC at the time of his crimes; (2) that Ayewoh had the requisite\n\nknowledge that he was defrauding BPPR (as opposed to the individual\n\ncredit card owners); or (3) that he made misrepresentations to\n\nBPPR.   We review sufficiency claims de novo, \"affirm[ing] the\n\nconviction if, after assaying all the evidence in the light most\n\namiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fits favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the elements of the\n\ncrime.\"    United States v. Wilder, 526 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(quoting United States v. Connolly, 341 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)).    We address each claim in turn.\n\n                                        A.\n\n            Ayewoh first contends that the government failed to\n\npresent sufficient evidence at trial to establish that BPPR was\n\ninsured by the FDIC at the time of his crimes.                     The bank fraud\n\nstatute at issue punishes the\n\n     knowing[] execut[ion] . . . [of] a scheme or artifice--\n     (1) to defraud a financial institution; or (2) to obtain\n     any of the moneys . . . owned by, or under the custody or\n     control of, a financial institution, by means of false or\n     fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1344.        The term \"financial institution\" as used in\n\nTitle 18 is defined in relevant part as \"an insured depository\n\ninstitution (as defined in section 3(c)(2) of the Federal Deposit\n\nInsurance Act).\"    18 U.S.C. § 20.           Section 3(c)(2) in turn defines\n\n\"insured    depository     institution\"         as     \"any    bank     or     savings\n\nassociation   the   deposits   of       which    are   insured     by    the   [FDIC]\n\npursuant to [the Federal Deposit Insurance Act].\"                       12 U.S.C. §\n\n1813(c)(2).      Thus,    under     §    1344,       the     defrauded       financial\n\ninstitution's    federally-insured            status    is    \"a   jurisdictional\n\nprerequisite as well as a substantive element of the crime,\" and as\n\nsuch must be proven by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fUnited States v. Key, 76 F.3d 350, 353 (11th Cir. 1996); see United\n\nStates v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 424 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           The government presented two items of evidence at trial\n\nto establish BPPR's federally-insured status: (1) a certificate of\n\nFDIC insurance issued to BPPR on January 2, 1999; and (2) testimony\n\nby BPPR’s record custodian regarding the certificate.             The record\n\ncustodian's testimony was as follows:\n\n     Q     I   would   like    to   show   you   government’s\n           identification number 1. . . . Without discussing\n           the substance, do you recognize that document?\n\n     A     Yes, I do.\n\n     Q     What do you recognize that to be?\n\n     A     This is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n           certificate issued to Banco Popular Puerto Rico on\n           January 1999.\n\n     Q     How do you   know   it    is   the   same   one   at   Banco\n           Popular?\n\n     A     My initials are on the back.\n\nAppellant's App. 131-32 (emphasis added).\n\n           Ayewoh did not object to admission of the certificate or\n\nto the record custodian’s testimony, and he did not cross examine\n\nthe witness.   Nonetheless, Ayewoh questioned in closing arguments\n\nwhether the evidence was sufficient to establish that BPPR was\n\nfederally insured during March and April of 2006, the time frame of\n\nhis criminal acts, and he subsequently moved for dismissal on these\n\ngrounds.   The district court treated Ayewoh's argument as a motion\n\nfor acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 and denied the motion.            The\n\n                                    -7-\n\fcourt concluded that, while an FDIC certificate issued in 1999\n\nmight by itself be insufficient to permit the jury to find that\n\nBPPR was federally insured in 2006, the addition of the record\n\ncustodian's       unobjected    \"present     tense\"    testimony       that     the\n\ncertificate \"is\" BPPR's FDIC certificate rendered the evidence\n\nsufficient.       United States v. Ayewoh, 587 F. Supp. 2d 378, 381\n\n(D.P.R.    2008).      That    is,   the    court   interpreted      the     record\n\ncustodian's statement as \"oral testimony that the bank was insured\n\nat the time of trial,\" which, when coupled with an FDIC certificate\n\nthat predated the offense, could permit a rational jury to infer\n\nthat BPPR was insured at the time of Ayewoh's crimes.                 Id.\n\n            The    FDIC   certificate      presented   in    this    case,    which\n\npredated    Ayewoh's      offenses   by    seven    years,    states:       \"[FDIC]\n\nWashington, D.C., Hereby certifies that the deposits of each\n\ndepositor in Banco Popular de Puerto Rico . . . are insured to the\n\nmaximum amount provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\"                   It\n\nfurther includes the official seal of the FDIC, signatures from\n\nboth the FDIC's Executive Secretary and Chairman of the Board,\n\nBPPR's unique FDIC certificate number, and the date of January 2,\n\n1999.     No expiration date is listed because FDIC insurance never\n\nexpires,    but     rather    continues    indefinitely      until    terminated\n\nvoluntarily or involuntarily under 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a) [hereinafter\n\nSection 8(a)].\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           Voluntary termination is not permissible for most banks.\n\n12 U.S.C. § 1818(a)(1).     Even involuntary termination for failure\n\nto pay the annual assessments (premiums) required by 12 U.S.C. §\n\n1817(b), or for any other reason, is not automatic; it requires\n\nnotice to the bank and a pre-termination hearing.          12 U.S.C. §\n\n1818(a)(2)(B), (a)(3).      Furthermore, for any termination under\n\nSection 8(a)–-whether voluntary or involuntary–-banks are required\n\nto give individual notice to each of their depositors, 12 U.S.C. §\n\n1818(a)(6), 12 C.F.R. § 307.3(a), and all deposits on the date of\n\ntermination will continue to be insured for at least six months and\n\nup to two years, 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a)(7).        In 2006, the year of\n\nAyewoh's crimes, there were 8,755 banks insured by the FDIC.           In\n\nthe ten years from 1997 through the end of 2006, only two banks had\n\ntheir FDIC insurance terminated under Section 8(a)--one voluntarily\n\nand one involuntarily.2     Clearly, termination of FDIC insurance is\n\nan exceedingly rare event in the banking industry.\n\n           Nevertheless, there is a serious question as to whether\n\nan FDIC certificate that predates the offense by seven years is\n\nalone sufficient evidence of federal insurance.          The Fifth and\n\nSeventh   Circuits   have   overturned   convictions   where   the   only\n\n\n     2\n       See 2006 FDIC Ann. Rep 117, 126 (showing statistics for\n2004-2006, with one voluntary termination under Section 8(a) in\n2006); 2004 FDIC Ann. Rep. 117 (showing no Section 8(a)\nterminations from 2002-2004); 2002 FDIC Ann. Rep. 121 (showing\nstatistics for 2000-2002, with one involuntary termination under\nSection 8(a) in 2000); 1999 FDIC Ann. Rep. 23 (showing no Section\n8(a) terminations from 1997-1999).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fevidence of federal insurance was a single FDIC certificate which\n\npredated the offense, see United States v. Platenburg, 657 F.2d\n\n797,   799   (5th   Cir.   1981)   (overturning       conviction   where     only\n\nevidence of federal insurance was an FDIC certificate predating the\n\noffense by seven years); United States v. Shively, 715 F.2d 260,\n\n265 (7th Cir. 1983) (where only evidence was an FDIC certificate\n\nwhich predated the offense by nine years), and the Ninth and Tenth\n\ncircuits have indicated their support for this view, see United\n\nStates v. Chapel, 41 F.3d 1338, 1340-41 (9th Cir. 1994); United\n\nStates v. Darrell, 828 F.2d 644, 648 (10th Cir. 1987).\n\n             We   need   not   decide     in   this   case   whether   the   FDIC\n\ncertificate would alone be sufficient proof of federal insurance,\n\nfor here there was also the testimony of BPPR's record custodian\n\nwho testified that the certificate offered into evidence \"is the\n\n[FDIC] certificate issued to [BPPR] on January 1999.\"              Appellant's\n\nApp. 132.     Here, the time between the alleged offenses and this\n\ntrial testimony was approximately two and a half years.\n\n             Generally, courts have found that testimony that a bank\n\nis insured at the time of trial can alone permit a reasonable jury\n\nto infer that the bank was insured at the time of the crime.                 For\n\nexample, when presented with a bank vice president's testimony that\n\nthe bank's deposits \"'are' FDIC-insured,\" the Second Circuit held\n\n       that where . . . the evidence is oral testimony that the\n       bank is insured, and the interval between the crime and\n       the trial is not great, it is reasonable to conclude that\n       \"viewed in context, the jury could draw the inference\n\n                                   -10-\n\f     that the bank was insured at the time of the [crime],\"–-\n     in other words, that th[e] jury could take \"is\" to mean\n     \"is and has been.\"\n\nUnited States v. Sliker, 751 F.2d 477, 484-85 (2d Cir. 1984)\n\n(internal citation omitted).         This approach is widely accepted by\n\nthe circuits.     See, e.g., United States v. Ware, 416 F.3d 1118,\n\n1121-23 (9th Cir. 2005); United States v. Lewis, 260 F.3d 855, 855-\n\n56 (8th Cir. 2001); United States v. Knop, 701 F.2d 670, 672-73\n\n(7th Cir. 1983); United States v. Safley, 408 F.2d 603, 605 (4th\n\nCir. 1969); United States v. Cook, 320 F.2d 258, 259 (5th Cir.\n\n1963).   But see United States v. Ali, 266 F.3d 1242, 1244 n.3 (9th\n\nCir. 2001) (finding testimony insufficient where time between trial\n\nand crime was too lengthy).          Furthermore, courts have tended to\n\naccept any bank employee's testimony as sufficient, regardless of\n\nwhether that employee was in a managerial position.             See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Bindley, 157 F.3d 1235, 1239 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n             However, Ayewoh contends in this case that the district\n\ncourt    erred   in   interpreting    the   testimony   of   BPPR's   record\n\ncustodian as \"oral testimony that the bank was insured at the time\n\nof trial.\"    Ayewoh, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 381.      Rather, Ayewoh argues\n\nthat the custodian's testimony that the certificate offered by the\n\ngovernment \"is the [FDIC] certificate issued to [BPPR] on January\n\n1999\" should be construed as nothing more than merely attesting to\n\nthe document's authenticity.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            We    conclude   that   the    bank   employee's   testimony     is\n\nambiguous   and    that   reasonable      minds   could   differ   as   to   its\n\ninterpretation.       On one hand, the testimony could be read as\n\nmeaning \"This is the [current FDIC] certificate [which was] issued\n\nto [BPPR] on January 1999.\"         Alternately, as Ayewoh contends, the\n\nstatement could reasonably be interpreted as mere authentication\n\ntestimony–-that is, to mean \"This is the [FDIC] certificate [which\n\nwas] issued to [BPPR] on January 1999.\"\n\n            This Court has previously stated that, \"[i]n reviewing a\n\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, the Court must view the facts in\n\nthe light most favorable to the Government, deferring to the jury's\n\nverdict if the evidence can support varying interpretations, at\n\nleast one of which is consistent with the defendant’s guilt.\"\n\nUnited States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190, 1203 (1st Cir. 1994) (emphasis\n\nadded).3    This analysis \"does not require a court to ask itself\n\nwhether it believes that the evidence at the trial established\n\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\" but rather whether \"any rational\n\ntrier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\n\n\n\n     3\n       See also United States v. Wilder, 526 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n2008) (\"[I]t is not the appellate court’s function to weigh the\nevidence or make credibility judgments.

Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 923\n(1st Cir. 1991) (\"The evidence need not exclude every reasonable\nhypothesis inconsistent with guilt, and the jury is entitled to\nchoose among varying interpretations of the evidence so long as the\ninterpretation it chooses is a reasonable one.\" (emphasis added)).\n\n                                     -12-\n\fbeyond a reasonable doubt.\"       Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,\n\n318-19 (1979) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\nTherefore, we \"ought not to disturb, on the ground of insufficient\n\nevidence, a jury verdict that is supported by a plausible rendition\n\nof the record.\"   Wilder, 526 F.3d at 8 (quoting Ortiz, 966 F.2d at\n\n711) (emphasis added).\n\n          Thus,   when    reviewing   evidence   for    sufficiency     and\n\nconsidering ambiguous testimony that is susceptible to more than\n\none reasonable interpretation, we must construe the testimony in\n\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution.4          We must therefore\n\npresume that the jury interpreted the record custodian’s testimony\n\nas a statement that the FDIC certificate offered into evidence\n\nindicated BPPR's presently-insured status as of the date of trial.\n\n          As   such,     the   ultimate   question     with   respect    to\n\nsufficiency in this case is whether a rational jury could have\n\n\n     4\n       See United States v. Lazzerini, 611 F.2d 940, 941-42 (1st\nCir. 1979) (finding that, in a juror corruption case where it was\nambiguous as to whether appellant's single-word statement \"Don't\"\nwas evidence that the defendant had urged the attempted influence\nbe stopped, the jury could have construed the statement in the\nprosecution's favor); see also United States v. Barnhart, 979 F.2d\n647, 650 (8th Cir. 1992) (\"On appellate review, we must construe\nall evidence--including the admittedly vague testimony . . . --in\nfavor of the government.\"); United States v. Taylor, 972 F.2d 1247,\n1251-52 (11th Cir. 1992) (reversing judgment of acquittal because,\nthough the allegedly threatening statement in greeting card was\narguably ambiguous, the court was required to resolve the ambiguity\nin   the prosecution's    favor   when   this   was  a   reasonable\ninterpretation); United States v. Horn, 946 F.2d 738, 743 (10th\nCir. 1991) (finding that a rational jury could interpret in the\ngovernment's favor ambiguous testimony regarding defendant's sale\nof crack).\n\n                                  -13-\n\ffound beyond a reasonable doubt that BPPR was federally-insured\n\nduring March and April of 2006 (the time frame of Ayewoh's crimes),\n\ngiven the evidence of: (1) an FDIC insurance certificate issued to\n\nBPPR in 1999; and (2) testimony by BPPR's record custodian which,\n\ninterpreted in the light most favorable to the government, asserted\n\nthat the certificate remained a valid symbol of BPPR's federally-\n\ninsured status at the time of trial.         We join the vast majority of\n\ncircuits in holding that such evidence is sufficient proof of FDIC\n\ninsurance.        That is, with evidence of FDIC insurance both at a time\n\npredating the offense and at the time of trial, a reasonable jury\n\ncould infer that, absent evidence to the contrary, the bank was\n\ninsured on the date of the crime.5\n\n             Consequently, we reject Ayewoh's contention that the\n\ngovernment failed to offer sufficient proof of FDIC insurance.\n\nThis is not to say that we endorse the prosecutor's handling of the\n\ncase.       The    prosecutor   assuredly   could–-and   should--have   done\n\nbetter.      Federally insured status is easily proved in a garden-\n\n\n        5\n       See, e.g., United States v. Maner, 611 F.2d 107, 110-11 (5th\nCir. 1980) (FDIC certificate which predated the offense and bank\nmanager's testimony that FDIC stickers were posted on teller\nwindows at time of trial was sufficient); United States v. Rowan,\n518 F.2d 685, 693 (6th Cir. 1975) (FDIC certificate dated 1969 and\nstatement by branch manager that bank was FDIC-insured in 1974 on\nday of trial was sufficient); United States v. Jackson, 430 F.2d\n1113, 1115-16 (9th Cir. 1970) (FDIC certificate identified by bank\nauditor and testimony insurance continued until cancelled was\nsufficient); United States v. Skiba, 271 F.2d 644, 644-45 (7th Cir.\n1959) (FDIC certificate and testimony by bank cashier that bank was\noperating at time of trial as an FDIC-insured organization was\nsufficient).\n\n                                     -14-\n\fvariety bank fraud case, and it is not too much to expect that the\n\ngovernment will take the need to do so seriously.                   That said,\n\nhowever, we find the proof in this case adequate, if barely, as to\n\nthat element of the offense.\n\n                                     B.\n\n             Ayewoh next contends that he lacked the requisite mens\n\nrea for the crime charged.          Under the bank fraud statute, the\n\nalleged scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution must\n\nhave been undertaken knowingly by the defendant. 18 U.S.C. § 1344;\n\nsee   also   Brandon,   17   F.3d   at    424.   Ayewoh    argues      that   the\n\ngovernment     presented     insufficient     evidence    to   prove    he    had\n\nknowledge that his actions would defraud BPPR itself, as opposed to\n\nthe individual credit card holders.          We disagree that the evidence\n\nwas insufficient.\n\n             When interpreting § 1344 in this circuit, \"[i]t has been\n\nestablished that the government does not have to show the alleged\n\nscheme was directed solely toward a particular institution; it is\n\nsufficient to show that [the] defendant knowingly . . . exposed a\n\n. . . bank to a risk of loss.\"           Brandon, 17 F.3d at 426 (emphasis\n\nadded); see also United States v. Moran, 312 F.3d 480, 489 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).     \"'Intent to harm' [a bank] is not required,\" United\n\nStates v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 29 (1st Cir. 2000) (en banc), so\n\n\"[e]ven proof of an extremely remote risk will suffice.\"                 United\n\nStates v. Barakett, 994 F.2d 1107, 1111 n.15 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fMoreover, it is unnecessary that a defendant know \"which particular\n\nbank will be victimized by his fraud,” so long as he \"knows that a\n\n[bank] will be defrauded\"--even a bank that is not federally\n\ninsured.    Brandon, 17 F.3d at 426.      As this Court stated in\n\nBrandon,\n\n      Congress intended to criminalize bank frauds that harm\n      federally insured banks, not just bank frauds directed\n      specifically toward federally insured banks. As other\n      courts have noted, the legislative history supports a\n      broad construction of the statutory language of the bank\n      fraud statute.\n           Defendants [cannot] . . . sanitize their fraud by\n      interposing an intermediary or an additional victim\n      between their fraud and the federally insured bank....\n      The fact that it should turn out that [a] financial\n      institution actually defrauded was federally insured is\n      a fortuitous stroke of bad luck for the defendants but\n      does not make it any less of a federal crime.\n\nId. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).    Thus, if a\n\ndefendant merely knows that his fraudulent actions will expose some\n\nbank (whether or not federally insured) to a risk of loss, the mens\n\nrea requirement of § 1344 is satisfied.\n\n           Ayewoh claims he \"had no way of knowing that [BPPR] would\n\nbe held responsible to the issuing banks for chargebacks\" resulting\n\nfrom his unauthorized credit card transactions.     Appellant's Br.\n\n27.   \"[T]he target of the scheme was not [BPPR],\" he contends, \"but\n\n[was] rather the credit card holders . . . .\"   Appellant's Br. 22.\n\nThis argument lacks merit.   Whether Ayewoh specifically knew BPPR\n\nwould be liable to the issuing banks for chargebacks is irrelevant,\n\nfor all § 1344 requires is knowledge that his fraudulent actions\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fwould expose some bank to a risk of loss.                  It is common knowledge\n\nthat cardholders may generally disavow unauthorized charges on\n\ntheir credit card statements and avoid personal losses from fraud,\n\nthereby placing the risk of loss on a bank.                       A reasonable jury\n\ntherefore could have concluded that Ayewoh knew his fraudulent\n\nactions would expose at least some bank--whether BPPR or even the\n\nforeign issuing banks--to a risk of loss.                      For mens rea, § 1344\n\nrequires nothing more. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to find\n\nthat Ayewoh defrauded BPPR while possessing the requisite mental\n\nstate under the bank fraud statute.\n\n                                           C.\n\n               Ayewoh urges that there was not sufficient evidence for\n\nthe jury to conclude that he violated § 1344 by knowingly executing\n\na scheme to obtain money from the custody of BPPR \"by means of\n\nfalse or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\"                     18\n\nU.S.C. § 1344.        Ayewoh contends that the act of entering a credit\n\ncard       number   into   a   POS    device    is   not   a   \"representation\"   of\n\nanything.       We disagree.         The majority of our sister circuits have\n\nbroadly held that the misrepresentation element of § 1344 is\n\nfulfilled by any intentional act or statement by an individual that\n\nfalsely indicates, explicitly or implicitly, that he has authority\n\nto withdraw money from a bank.6                We find that, by running credit\n\n\n       6\n       See United States v. Jenkins, 210 F.3d 884, 886 (8th Cir.\n2000) (deposit of credit card slips constituted representation that\nsales had actually taken place); United States v. Miller, 70 F.3d\n\n                                          -17-\n\fcard numbers through his POS device, Ayewoh at least implicitly\n\nrepresented to BPPR that he had the cardholders’ authorization to\n\nmake the charges.       Here, as in other contexts, we are reluctant to\n\nadopt   a   construction    of    the   statute   that   would   exclude   \"new\n\nfinancial instruments.\"          United States v. Agne, 214 F.3d 47, 54\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).     Moreover, it makes no difference that the agent\n\nof the bank defrauded by Ayewoh's deceit was a computer as opposed\n\nto a human teller.      Without the implied representation that he was\n\nauthorized to charge the credit cards at issue, BPPR assuredly\n\nwould not have paid money into OIPA's account. Consequently, there\n\nwas sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Ayewoh\n\nacquired funds from BPPR through fraudulent misrepresentations.\n\n                                        III.\n\n            We   turn    finally    to     Ayewoh's   contention    that    the\n\nprosecutor violated his Fifth Amendment rights by referring during\n\nclosing arguments to Ayewoh's decision not to testify. The closing\n\n\n1353, 1355-56 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (use of victim's ATM card and PIN\nconstituted fraudulent misrepresentation that defendant had\nauthority to withdraw funds); United States v. Briggs, 965 F.2d 10,\n12 (5th Cir. 1992) (making a wire transfer by falsely holding\noneself out to have such authority constituted fraudulent\nmisrepresentation); United States v. Falcone, 934 F.2d 1528, 1542\n(11th Cir. 1991) (deposit of fraudulent check constituted\nmisrepresentation), vacated, reh'g en banc granted, 939 F.2d 1455\n(11th Cir. 1991), panel opinion reinstated in relevant part, 960\nF.2d 988, 990 n.6 (11th Cir. 1992) (en banc); United States v.\nWorthington, 822 F.2d 315, 318 (2nd Cir. 1987) (deposit of check\nfrom fictitious bank was misrepresentation because it constituted\na false \"averment that an obligor exists\"); United States v. Price,\n763 F.2d 640, 643 (4th Cir. 1985) (deposit of false credit card\nslips constituted misrepresentation \"akin to forgery\").\n\n                                        -18-\n\fargument is \"an especially delicate point in the trial process,\"\n\nand we scrutinize the prosecutor's comments accordingly.          United\n\nStates v. Glover, 558 F.3d 71, 77 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir. 1995)).        In Griffin v.\n\nCalifornia, 380 U.S. 609, 614 (1965), the Supreme Court held that\n\n\"comment on the [defendant's] refusal to testify\" burdens the\n\nconstitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination and\n\nis therefore prohibited.     To decide whether Ayewoh is entitled to\n\nrelief, we engage in a two-pronged analysis: First, we conduct a de\n\nnovo review to determine whether the prosecutor's comments offended\n\nthe Fifth Amendment by improperly insinuating that Ayewoh's failure\n\nto testify constituted evidence of guilt. Gomes v. Brady, 564 F.3d\n\n532, 537 (1st Cir. 2009).     To that end, \"we consider 'whether, in\n\nthe circumstances of the particular case, the language used was\n\nmanifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would\n\nnaturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of\n\nthe accused to testify.'\"      Id. at 538 (quoting United States v.\n\nGlantz, 810 F.2d 316, 322 (1st Cir. 1987)).                Second, if we\n\ndetermine   the   comments   were   improper   and   the   objection   was\n\npreserved, we review for harmless error.       Glover, 558 F.3d at 76.\n\n            At trial, Ayewoh's counsel urged that Ayewoh did not\n\nknowingly defraud anyone because he believed at the time that he\n\nhad obtained the credit cards legitimately from a \"friend of a\n\nfriend\" who sought to invest in his company OIPA, Inc.        Under this\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\ftheory, the unidentified \"friend of a friend\" was the real criminal\n\nwho defrauded innocent Ayewoh by purporting to be a legitimate\n\ninvestor.    Though Ayewoh did not testify at trial, he proffered\n\nthis    defense    through    the   testimony      of   his   wife.    BPPR's\n\ninvestigator Mr. Ponce also testified that Ayewoh stated during an\n\ninterview that he had received the credit cards from a \"friend of\n\na friend\" who was an investor in Europe and that the transaction\n\nhad been done entirely through his friend.              Appellant's App. 211.\n\nFinally, in closing arguments, Ayewoh’s counsel repeatedly asserted\n\nthat the purported \"friend of a friend\" was entirely to blame and\n\nthat Ayewoh was himself an innocent victim of fraud.             For context,\n\nwe   quote   the   relevant   portions      of   defense   counsel’s   closing\n\nargument:\n\n       [T]he money was invested in OIPA, Inc., by this friend of\n       a friend.\n            Mr. Ayewoh committed a mistake, but that mistake was\n       not defrauding anybody. That mistake was trying to grow\n       and seeing an opportunity and grabbing it without looking\n       at what was behind it, because somebody who knew that he\n       was in need offered him his dream, I’ll give you the\n       money, here, start charging here. And he did.\n\nTrial Tr., Oct. 14, 2008, ECF No. 84, at 28 (emphasis added).\n\n       [Ayewoh] got somebody to invest in his company, the\n       company that he, with his wife, was developing so that he\n       could make a better living for himself and also pay back\n       his investors.\n            But he was defrauded.... And you’ll say, but look at\n       all those things that the government showed . . . .\n            . . . .\n            The government doesn’t know if [Ayewoh] called his\n       friend to find out, hey, these [credit cards] are being\n       rejected, what’s going on[?] And his friend told him, Oh,\n       I gave you the wrong number. Oh, I need to deposit. Oh,\n\n                                     -20-\n\f     I need to do something.\n           We don’t know that.    The government doesn’t know\n     that.\n\nTrial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 29 (emphasis added).\n\n          Ladies and gentlemen, the mistake Mr. Ayewoh made\n     was that he believed the friend of a friend.\n\nTrial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 35 (emphasis added).\n\n          It is a pity that [Ayewoh] didn’t have a contract\n     with this gentleman that lent him the money. If he had\n     sought his attorney’s advice at the moment, he would have\n     had one.\n\nTrial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 38.\n\n     Everything that surrounds this case shows that somebody\n     tried to defraud the bank. . . .\n          But that somebody is not Mr. Ayewoh. That somebody\n     is the person, the friend of the friend that gave him the\n     credit card numbers. We don’t know who he is.\n\nTrial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 40 (emphasis added).\n\n          Seeking to cast doubt on Ayewoh's defense theory, the\n\ngovernment made several comments in closing regarding the lack of\n\na known identity for Ayewoh’s purported \"friend of a friend.\"\n\nSpecifically, Ayewoh contends that the following three comments\n\nmade during the government's rebuttal argument violated his Fifth\n\nAmendment rights by improperly commenting on his failure to testify\n\nas to the alleged investor's identity:\n\n     [1] Okay. Let's say the defendant says it is a mistake.\n     Well, you have an instruction on willful blindness. Was\n     he willfully blind that these credit cards were, in fact,\n     stolen[?]\n          Well, let's look at the defendant's statement.\n          A friend of a friend. To this day, to this day, you\n     have heard from government witnesses, you have even heard\n     from the defendant’s spouse. We still don’t know who\n\n                                 -21-\n\f      this friend of a friend is. . . .\n           You are going to have, you know, an individual make\n      over $100,000 worth of investments in your company and\n      then not know who the person is. Not do an investment\n      contract?\n\nTrial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 46-47 (emphasis added).\n\n      [2] It makes absolutely no sense that this defendant got\n      these numbers from a friend of a friend, over 16 credit\n      cards, start[ed] essentially doing the manual POS\n      transactions, multiple times, and not know who that\n      individual is.\n           We still don't know who that individual is.\n      Gentleman who lent the money, we have no idea. We have\n      no name.\n\nTrial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 47-48 (emphasis added).\n\n      [3] But here, in looking at all the evidence--and, you\n      know, the defendant has argued that, now, this was a\n      mistake, that he believed a friend of a friend. That it\n      was a mistake, in believing a friend of a friend, that\n      what he wanted to do was to get a good life.\n           Well, this is not believable.       Use your common\n      sense.   Okay.   Common sense doesn't--it doesn’t make\n      sense. It is not a mistake that you get 17 credit card\n      numbers from a person that you don't know, have no idea\n      and then do multiple transactions over a short period of\n      time in order to figure out what the credit limits of the\n      credit cards are. You just don't do that.\n           Because if you have a friend of a friend who is\n      actually giving you these numbers and you know who that\n      friend is, you call that friend and you tell the friend,\n      \"Listen, the credit card isn't working, what's happening,\n      [is it] being declined for insufficient funds?\" But you\n      haven't heard evidence of that.\n\nTrial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 51-52 (emphasis added).\n\n           Ayewoh's counsel timely objected to the first of these\n\nremarks by requesting to approach the bench, but the court denied\n\nthe request.     Ayewoh subsequently moved for a mistrial \"based on\n\nthe   comments   made   by   the   prosecution   as   to   the   defendant's\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fsilence,\" but the court denied the motion as well.              Ayewoh now\n\ncontends on appeal that the prosecutor's comments were improper\n\nbecause only Ayewoh could have provided the identity of the \"friend\n\nof   a   friend,\"   so   references   to   the   lack   of   such   evidence\n\nnecessarily pointed to his failure to testify.          We disagree.\n\n            First, contrary to Ayewoh's contention that only he could\n\nprovide the identity of the \"friend of a friend,\" Ayewoh himself\n\nwas not the only person who could identify the alleged investor if\n\nhe existed.   For example, the \"friend\" who purportedly acted as an\n\nintermediary between Ayewoh and the mysterious \"friend of a friend\"\n\nmight have testified as to the investor's identity and to their\n\nbusiness arrangement.       Moreover, in his interview with the bank\n\nrepresentative, Ayewoh reportedly stated that he never knew the\n\nidentity of the \"friend of a friend\" because the deal was all done\n\nthrough an immediate friend.     Appellant's App. at 211.       Thus, this\n\ncase is distinguishable from cases in which \"[n]o one but [the]\n\nappellant . . . could have [testified]\" regarding the issue, see\n\nDesmond v. United States, 345 F.2d 225, 227 (1st Cir. 1965),\n\nbecause here it was \"apparent on the record that there was someone\n\nother than himself whom the defendant could have called.\"            Id.   As\n\nsuch, the prosecutor's comments regarding the lack of such evidence\n\nin the record did not \"naturally and necessarily\" point to Ayewoh's\n\nfailure to testify.      Gomes, 564 F.3d at 538 (quoting Glantz, 810\n\nF.2d at 322); see also United States v. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d 1, 8-9\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f(1st Cir. 2005) (prosecutor’s comments that \"there’s no real\n\nevidence\" and \"pretty much nothing\" to support defendant’s theory\n\ndid not \"naturally and necessarily\" comment on his failure to\n\ntestify because they likely \"referred to [defendant’s] failure to\n\nproduce other evidence supporting his theory,\" or were at most\n\nambiguous).\n\n          Second, even if the prosecutor's remarks could be read as\n\ncommenting on Ayewoh's failure to testify, the comments were a\n\n\"fair response\" to claims by the defendant.        In United States v.\n\nRobinson, 485 U.S. 25, 34 (1988), the Supreme Court carved out an\n\nexception to Griffin for prosecutors who refer to a defendant’s\n\nfailure to testify while \"fairly responding to an argument of the\n\ndefendant.\"   In that case, the defense counsel asserted in closing\n\narguments that the government had not given the defendant a chance\n\nto tell his side of the story.        Id. at 27.     On rebuttal, the\n\nprosecutor responded by informing the jury that the defendant\n\n\"could have taken the stand and explained it to you.\"       Id. at 28.\n\nFinding no Fifth Amendment violation, the Supreme Court reasoned\n\nthat, \"[w]here the prosecutor on his own initiative asks the jury\n\nto draw an adverse inference from a defendant's silence, Griffin\n\nholds that the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination is\n\nviolated,\" but where the prosecutor's reference to the defendant's\n\nfailure to testify is a \"fair response to a claim made by defendant\n\nor his counsel,\" the Fifth Amendment is not offended.       Id. at 31-\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f32.   The Court further explained that \"the Fifth Amendment should\n\n[not] be converted into a sword that cuts back on the area of\n\nlegitimate comment by the prosecutor on the weaknesses in the\n\ndefense['s] case.\" Id. (quoting United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S.\n\n499, 515 (1974) (Stevens, J., concurring)).\n\n           Following the Supreme Court's decision in Robinson, this\n\nCourt has applied the \"fair response\" doctrine in numerous cases.7\n\n\n\n      7\n       See United States v. Stroman, 500 F.3d 61, 64-66 (1st Cir.\n2007) (finding that the prosecutor's reference to defendant's\nconfession as being \"not contradicted\" was a fair response to the\ndefendant's defense theory that challenged the confession's\nreliability); United States v. Mangual-Garcia, 505 F.3d 1, 13 (1st\nCir. 2007) (applying the \"invited reply doctrine\" to find no Fifth\nAmendment violation where, after defense counsel argued in closing\nthat the prosecution failed to produce evidence such as a utility\nbill to prove the defendant's location, the prosecution responded\nby stating that the defendant could have produced his own utility\nbills if they were exculpatory); United States v. Henderson, 320\nF.3d 92, 107 (1st Cir. 2003) (where defense counsel argued in\nclosing that the government did an insufficient job tracking down\na specific eyewitness, the prosecution fairly responded by stating:\n\"Where is [the eyewitness], both counsel ask you? Well, that's a\ngood question. Why don't they tell us?\"); United States v. Adams,\n305 F.3d 30, 37-38 (1st Cir. 2002) (where defense counsel argued in\nclosing that the government failed to call a particular informant,\nthe prosecution did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof by\nfairly responding that defense counsel \"could have called [him] if\nhe wanted him\"); Amirault v. Fair, 968 F.2d 1404, 1406 (1st Cir.\n1992) (where defense counsel suggested the prosecution was biased\nagainst the defendant because no one ever asked him his side of the\nstory, the prosecution fairly responded by informing the jury that,\nwhile the law forbids the state from approaching a defendant after\nhis arrest, \"the law does not prevent [a defendant] from\naffirmatively telling his side\" of the story); United States v.\nRouleau, 894 F.2d 13, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1990) (where defense counsel\nargued in closing that the government had not found the money\nrelating to an alleged drug transaction, prosecutor fairly\nresponded by stating that \"[o]nly [the defendant] knows where that\n[money] is now\").\n\n                               -25-\n\fLikewise, our sister circuits have invoked the \"fair response\"\n\ndoctrine to reject Fifth Amendment claims on similar facts.8\n\n           We find that Robinson controls in this case and that,\n\nviewed in context, the prosecutor's challenged comments were part\n\nof a \"fair response\" to the arguments made by Ayewoh's counsel.\n\nThe first two challenged comments, which emphasized the lack of\n\nevidence regarding the identity of the purported \"friend of a\n\nfriend,\" were permissible attacks on the plausibility of Ayewoh's\n\ndefense theory.    \"Having put forth a theory in [his] defense,\"\n\nAyewoh   \"[could   not]   expect   the    government   to   refrain   from\n\ncommenting on its deficiencies\" and the lack of evidentiary support\n\n\n\n     8\n       See, e.g., United States v. Ivory, 532 F.3d 1095, 1100-03\n(10th Cir. 2008) (where defense counsel argued that the government\nhad presented no evidence as to the meaning of a certain code word,\nprosecution fairly responded by insinuating that only the defendant\ncould have supplied that information); Cook v. Schriro, 538 F.3d\n1000, 1018-20 (9th Cir. 2008) (where witness vaguely testified that\ndefendant had an alibi, prosecution fairly responded by attacking\nthe alibi's credibility on grounds that defendant had never\nactually told the witness where he was at the time of the crime);\nUnited States v. Isaac, 134 F.3d 199, 206-07 (3d Cir. 1998) (where\ndefense counsel attacked the credibility of defendant's accomplices\nwho testified against him, it was a fair response for the\nprosecution to note that, while the witnesses were not \"paragons of\nvirtue,\" nobody other than the defendant and the witness-\naccomplices could have testified to the events at issue); Howard v.\nMoore, 131 F.3d 399, 421 (4th Cir. 1997) (where defense counsel\nasserted that the defendant was remorseful for his actions,\nprosecution fairly responded by arguing that none of the\ndefendant's actions or statements indicated remorse); United States\nv. Smith, 41 F.3d 1565, 1569 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (finding that\nprosecutor's indirect reference to defendant's failure to testify\nwas not a Fifth Amendment violation because his comments were\nmerely a \"fair response\" that challenged the plausibility of the\ndefendant's innocent bystander defense).\n\n                                   -26-\n\ffor his theory--namely, that the record did not even include the\n\nidentity of the mysterious person whom Ayewoh claimed he mistakenly\n\nbelieved \"invested\" over $122,000 in his company.        The prosecution\n\nwas permitted to highlight such a glaring weakness in the defense's\n\ncase.\n\n          Similarly,   it   is   clear   that   the   prosecutor's   third\n\nchallenged comment, viewed in context, was a \"fair response\"\n\nspecifically to the defense counsels comment that \"[t]he government\n\ndoesn't know if [Ayewoh] called his friend to find out\" why some of\n\nthe credit cards weren't working.        Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 29.\n\nOn rebuttal, the prosecutor's third comment fairly responded to the\n\ndefense counsel's statement by informing the jury that \"you haven't\n\nheard evidence\" that Ayewoh placed any such calls to his friend.\n\nTrial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 52.\n\n          Thus, because all of the prosecutor's challenged comments\n\nwere made in \"fair response\" to claims by the defense, Ayewoh's\n\nFifth Amendment rights were not violated.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Ayewoh's conviction\n\nand sentence on the bank fraud and forfeiture counts.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                   -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\f            THOMPSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting.           I am happy to join\n\nmy colleagues' opinion except as to Section II.A.               I cannot agree\n\nwith their characterization of the evidence offered to show that\n\nBPPR was insured by the FDIC when Ayewoh defrauded BPPR – a central\n\nelement of the conviction.         The record, containing only a seven-\n\nyear-old FDIC certificate and its authenticating testimony, is too\n\nflimsy to support the interpretation that the majority constructs\n\nupon it.   Where, as here, the government has failed to prove every\n\nelement of the crime of which the defendant was charged beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, his conviction cannot stand.\n\n            For more than thirty years now, prosecutors have been on\n\nnotice that they must be as diligent in proving the FDIC insurance\n\nelement of crimes like bank fraud as they are in proving any other\n\nelement.     In    1980,    the   Fifth    Circuit   expressed       \"difficulty\n\ncomprehending why the [g]overnment repeatedly fails to prove this\n\nelement    more   carefully    since    [its]   burden     is   so   simple   and\n\nstraightforward,\"     and     warned    the   government    that     it   \"treads\n\nperilously close to reversal.\"            United States v. Maner, 611 F.2d\n\n107, 112 (5th Cir. 1980). With increasing exasperation, our sister\n\ncircuits have since continuously issued warnings to the government,\n\nimploring it to take this requirement more seriously.9 Eventually,\n\n\n     9\n       See, e.g., United States v. Rusan, 460 F.3d 989, 994-95 (8th\nCir. 2006); United States v. Bindley, 157 F.3d 1235, 1239 & n.3\n(10th Cir. 1998); United States v. Slovacek, 867 F.2d 842, 846 (5th\nCir. 1989); United States v. Sliker, 751 F.2d 477, 484 (2d Cir.\n1984); United States v. Knop, 701 F.2d 670, 674 (7th Cir. 1983);\n\n                                       -28-\n\fthey began reversing convictions where the government's measly\n\nevidentiary proffer could not have persuaded a jury beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the financial institution at issue was FDIC-\n\ninsured as of the offense date.10\n\n          Though the line between sufficiency and insufficiency is\n\nby no means bright, its broad contours are readily discernible. On\n\none side is a single FDIC certificate pre-dating the offense, which\n\nour sister circuits have uniformly rejected as insufficient.            Maj.\n\nOp. at 9-10 (collecting cases).    On the other side is the testimony\n\nof a bank employee to the effect that the bank is insured at the\n\ntime of the trial, which is usually adequate.           Maj. Op. at 10-11\n\n(collecting cases).   The central question, then, is this:         did the\n\ngovernment introduce enough evidence in this case to push the proof\n\nof insurance across that line?      It is here that I depart from my\n\ncolleagues' analysis.\n\n          The majority parses the evidence of insurance into two\n\nseparate pieces:   the FDIC certificate and the testimony of BPPR's\n\nrecord-keeper.     The   certificate     itself,   as    in   Shively   and\n\nPlatenburg, was issued about seven years before Ayewoh's fraud.\n\n\nid. at 676-77 (Posner, J., dissenting).\n     10\n       See, e.g., United States v. Sandles, 469 F.3d 508, 512-17\n(6th Cir. 2006); United States v. Ali, 266 F.3d 1242, 1243-45 (9th\nCir. 2001); United States v. Dennis, 237 F.3d 1295, 1303-05 (11th\nCir. 2001); United States v. Lindsay, 184 F.3d 1138, 1142 (10th\nCir. 1999); United States v. Shively, 715 F.2d 260, 265, 269 (7th\nCir. 1983) (Posner, J.); United States v. Platenburg, 657 F.2d 797,\n799-800 (5th Cir. 1981).\n\n                                  -29-\n\fBecause a jury cannot reasonably conclude, without something more,\n\nthat the bank's insurance status has remained in force throughout\n\nthe   intervening     years,   see   Shively,   715   F.2d   at   265,   the\n\ncertificate is insufficient.          That leaves the record-keeper's\n\ntestimony, which the majority insists provides enough proof of\n\ninsurance that, when combined with the certificate, it pushes the\n\nquantum of evidence across the line.\n\n           As my colleagues recognize, the jury's verdict must be\n\n\"supported by a plausible rendition of the record,\"          United States\n\nv. Wilder, 526 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal quotations\n\nomitted), and although \"the jury is entitled to choose among\n\nvarying interpretations of the evidence[,] . . . the interpretation\n\nit chooses [must be] a reasonable one,\" United States v. Martinez,\n\n922 F.2d 914, 923 (1st Cir. 1991).          The factfinder does not have\n\nunfettered discretion to rely on any conceivable interpretation of\n\nthe evidence.   True, appellate courts must \"view the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the [g]overnment,\" United States v. Neal,\n\n36 F.3d 1190, 1203 (1st Cir. 1994), but the touchstones are\n\nplausibility and reasonableness.\n\n           Here is the entirety of the record-keeper's testimony:\n\n      Q: I would like to show you government's identification\n      number 1. Let the record reflect that it has been shown\n      to the defendant[.]\n\n      Q: Without discussing the substance, do you recognize\n      that document?\n\n      A: Yes, I do.\n\n                                     -30-\n\f     Q: What do you recognize that to be?\n\n     A: This is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n     certificate issued to Banco Popular [de] Puerto Rico on\n     January 1999.\n\n     Q: How do you know it is the same one at Banco Popular?\n\n     A: My initials are on the back.\n\n     [Q:] Your Honor, we ask that government's exhibit 1 be\n     admitted into evidence.\n\nThe majority asserts that this exchange is amenable to multiple\n\nreasonable interpretations, including one that relates to BPPR's\n\ninsurance status at the time of trial.              Maj. Op. at 12.       I\n\ndisagree.        Rather,     the    record-keeper's      testimony   merely\n\nauthenticated the paper she was shown as the 1999 certificate.\n\nOnce the government succeeded in entering the certificate into the\n\nrecord,     it   elicited    no    further   testimony     explaining   the\n\nsignificance     of   the   certificate.11    The     testimonial    context\n\nreinforces that this is the only plausible interpretation.              The\n\nrecord-keeper gave the key statement relied upon by the majority\n\nafter being asked to identify the document \"[w]ithout discussing\n\n[its] substance . . . .\"           Moreover, immediately after the key\n\n     11\n       Moreover, contrary to the majority's implication, Maj. Op.\nat 7, Ayewoh did not have any reason to \"object to admission of the\ncertificate or to the record custodian's testimony\" or to \"cross\nexamine the witness.\" An objection to evidence that was clearly\nfoundational and properly framed would have been unnecessary if not\ninappropriate. And Ayewoh had no duty to cross-examine the record-\nkeeper, especially when the exercise could only have assisted the\nprosecution.     Instead, counsel properly adhered to cross-\nexamination expert Irving Younger's well-regarded advice by leaving\ninsufficient testimony alone – not asking one question too many –\nand holding the prosecution to its burden of proof.\n\n                                    -31-\n\fstatement, the government asked how she knew the document before\n\nher was the same one on file at BPPR, and she responded, \"My\n\ninitials are on the back.\"         The colloquy thus dealt only with the\n\nwitness's    personal    knowledge    of    the   physical      certificate     and\n\nexplicitly stopped short of discussing its content, legal effect,\n\nor – most importantly – continuing validity.\n\n            The majority disagrees, suggesting that the key passage\n\nin the colloquy above could be interpreted by a rational juror to\n\nmean, \"This is the [current FDIC] certificate [which was] issued to\n\n[BPPR] on January 1999.\" Maj. Op. at 12 (alterations in original).\n\nBut this interpretation imports meaning that the testimony itself\n\ndoes not support:       the word \"current\" cannot be inferred from or\n\nfound anywhere in either the statement or its testimonial context.\n\nIndeed, the statement conveys no information other than that the\n\ncertificate is authentic and was issued in 1999.12\n\n            The majority also discusses the relative infrequency with\n\nwhich FDIC certificates are revoked.          Maj. Op. at 8-9.       While this\n\ninformation, in concert with other evidence, might buttress a\n\njury's    conclusion    that   a    certificate      remains     valid,    it    is\n\nirrelevant   here   because    it    is    nowhere   in   the    record.        When\n\n     12\n       While no analogy is perfect, the following might serve to\nilluminate this point. Imagine that a prosecutor, pointing to a\ndefendant, asked a witness, \"Without saying anything substantive\nabout him, do you recognize that man?\" If the witness responded,\n\"Yes I do, that is John Doe,\" it would be unreasonable for a jury\n(or a court) to interpret that statement as \"Yes I do, that is\n[murderer] John Doe.\" Adding a single word can make a world of\ndifference.\n\n                                     -32-\n\fconsidering sufficiency claims, we consider only the evidence\n\navailable to the factfinder, cf. United States v. DeCologero, 530\n\nF.3d 36, 65 (1st Cir. 2008), because it is ultimately the jury that\n\nmust find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, not a\n\nreviewing court.        Of course, juries may rely upon their common\n\nsense and upon any fact in common knowledge in reaching a verdict.\n\nSee, e.g., Maroules v. Jumbo, Inc., 452 F.3d 639, 644-45 (7th Cir.\n\n2006).    But because the jury in this case was not made aware of the\n\nprocedural and statistical details relating to the revocation of\n\nFDIC certificates, they should not inform our consideration of the\n\nsufficiency       the   government's    proof.      Unlike    the   majority's\n\nreasonable    suggestion      that     \"[i]t   is   common    knowledge    that\n\ncardholders may generally disavow unauthorized charges on their\n\ncredit card statements,\" Maj. Op. at 17, for example, it is hardly\n\ncommon knowledge that FDIC certificates are rarely revoked.               Since\n\nwe cannot assume that the intricacies of FDIC insurance are widely\n\nknown, we cannot say that there was sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe proposition that BPPR was insured when Ayewoh carried out his\n\nschemes.\n\n            The    government's      failure   to   prove    an   indispensable\n\nelement of the charged offense appears against a backdrop of both\n\ndecades of warnings urging it to be more careful and notice after\n\ntrial of the possibility of reversal.13              In situations such as\n\n     13\n       Both Ayewoh and the district court alerted the government\nto the infirmity of the evidence it adduced to prove the insurance\n\n                                       -33-\n\fthese, as Judge Posner explained, \"either the government proved\n\nevery element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt or it did\n\nnot.   If it did not, we must reverse; if it did, it is no business\n\nof ours that it could have put on an even stronger case.\"     Knop,\n\n701 F.2d at 677 (Posner, J., dissenting).   Here, the government's\n\ndeliberate oversight compels the reversal of Ayewoh's conviction\n\nand sentence.\n\n           I do not come to this conclusion lightly.   Ayewoh admits\n\nto intending to defraud innocent credit card owners. He stole more\n\nthan one hundred thousand dollars, some tens of thousands of which\n\nwere either never recovered by BPPR or borne unreported by the\n\nvictimized cardholders.    Nevertheless, we should not allow the\n\ncenturies-old proposition that all elements of a crime must be\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt, see In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358,\n\n361 (1970), to be eroded slowly for expediency's sake.\n\n\nelement. When Ayewoh filed his motion for acquittal, he pointed\nout the numerous exhortations from the courts of appeals not to\ntreat cavalierly the necessity of providing such proof. At that\npoint, had the government simply moved to reopen the case and\nprovided any one of a myriad of other pieces of evidence to\nsubstantiate its claim, Ayewoh's conviction would be unassailable.\nSee United States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292, 299-300 (1st Cir.\n2000) (approving that practice). For example, the government could\nhave asked the record-keeper whether she had searched for any\ndocuments that superseded or rescinded the certificate. See Neal,\n36 F.3d at 1207 n.22. It could have called BPPR's manager to ask\nwhether the company was insured. See United States v. Vachon, 869\nF.2d 653, 657 (1st Cir. 1989). It could even have introduced into\nevidence \"the cancelled check for the [insurance premium for the]\nperiod of time covering\" the offense. Maner, 611 F.2d at 112 n.2.\nInstead, it stubbornly insisted on the sufficiency of the paltry\nevidence it had already produced.\n\n                               -34-\n\fI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                    -35-\n\f",

On appeal Ayewoh contends that the government provided insufficient evidence that the defrauded bank, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (\"BPPR\"), was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") at the time of the crimes; that Ayewoh knowingly defrauded BPPR; or that Ayewoh made misrepresentations to BPPR. Ayewoh further contends that the prosecutor violated his Fifth Amendment rights by referring to his decision not to testify. We reject these contentions and affirm Ayewoh's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>In 2005, Ayewoh established OIPA, Inc., as a for profit corporation in Puerto Rico to provide inspection services at public housing projects for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). Ayewoh was the President of the corporation, and his wife was the Secretary. In OIPA's name, Ayewoh acquired a credit card point-of-sale device (\"POS device\") and a merchant's account at BPPR. A POS device allows a merchant to accept credit card payments either electronically (by swiping a card's magnetic strip through the device) or manually (by entering a card's number with a keypad).<sup>[1]</sup> HUD's method of payment for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*916</span> OIPA's inspection services included providing Ayewoh with a credit card number and authorizing him to perform manual transactions. However, the government presented evidence at trial that Ayewoh used the POS device to execute numerous unauthorized manual transactions using other credit card numbers, many of which belonged to cards issued by foreign banks. The defense's theory was that Ayewoh innocently believed that the credit card charges made to the POS device were authorized by the cardholders as legitimate investments in a new real estate venture. In order to understand the respective theories, some understanding of industry practice and Ayewoh's own activities is required.</p>\n<p>When a credit card transaction executed on a POS device is accepted by the bank that issued the card (\"issuing bank\"), the payment is deposited directly into the merchant's bank account (at the \"acquiring bank\"). In the event that a cardholder disputes a transaction, contractual agreements with credit card providers such as Visa and MasterCard permit the issuing bank to initiate a \"chargeback\" whereby the acquiring bank is liable to the issuing bank for the full amount of the disputed charge. The acquiring bank, in turn, looks to the merchant for reimbursement.</p>\n<p>Ayewoh was the only person with access to OIPA's POS device. For several months, Ayewoh, using the POS device, processed relatively small charges, with monthly totals ranging from $1,045 in February 2006, to $9,135 in March 2006. However, in April 2006, OIPA's account received $113,070 in payments from at least sixteen different credit cards. BPPR's records showed numerous instances in which OIPA's POS device attempted to run a large transaction, which was declined, and then it immediately attempted several additional transactions with the same credit card for progressively smaller amounts. Upon detecting this suspicious activity, BPPR froze OIPA's account and sent investigators to question Ayewoh. When asked how he obtained the credit card numbers at issue, Ayewoh claimed he received a list of numbers from a \"friend of a friend\" in Europe who wanted to invest in a new housing development project Ayewoh had planned for OIPA. Though repeatedly asked, Ayewoh declined to provide information about the project and stated that he did not know the identity of the alleged investor.</p>\n<p>Soon thereafter the banks that issued the credit cards in question began notifying BPPR that Ayewoh's March and April charges were unauthorized. BPPR subsequently returned $122,104 in chargebacks to the issuing banks. Of this $122,104, BPPR was only able to recover about $100,000 from Ayewoh, who had withdrawn large amounts before his account was frozen. BPPR suffered a net loss of $19,644.</p>\n<p>Ayewoh was indicted by a grand jury in November 2007 on one count of bank fraud, charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344, and one forfeiture count, charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 981(a)(1)(C) and 982(a)(2). After a jury trial in October 2008, Ayewoh was convicted and sentenced to thirty months in prison to be followed by five years of supervised release. He was further ordered to pay restitution to BPPR in the amount of its losses. Ayewoh timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*917</span> II.</h2>\n<p>Ayewoh does not dispute that the evidence established that he made unauthorized charges to the credit cards at issue. However, Ayewoh contends on appeal that the government failed to prove all of the essential elements of the bank fraud offense. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1344. Specifically, he claims that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to permit a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that BPPR was insured by the FDIC at the time of his crimes; (2) that Ayewoh had the requisite knowledge that he was defrauding BPPR (as opposed to the individual credit card owners); or (3) that he made misrepresentations to BPPR. We review sufficiency claims de novo, \"affirm[ing] the conviction if, after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the elements of the crime.\" <i>United States v. Wilder,</i> 526 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.2003)). We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Ayewoh first contends that the government failed to present sufficient evidence at trial to establish that BPPR was insured by the FDIC at the time of his crimes. The bank fraud statute at issue punishes the</p>\n<blockquote>knowing[] execut[ion] ... [of] a scheme or artifice(1) to defraud a financial institution; or (2) to obtain any of the moneys ... owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 1344. The term \"financial institution\" as used in Title 18 is defined in relevant part as \"an insured depository institution (as defined in section 3(c)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act).\" 18 U.S.C. § 20. Section 3(c)(2) in turn defines \"insured depository institution\" as \"any bank or savings association the deposits of which are insured by the [FDIC] pursuant to [the Federal Deposit Insurance Act].\" 12 U.S.C. § 1813(c)(2). Thus, under § 1344, the defrauded financial institution's federally-insured status is \"a jurisdictional prerequisite as well as a substantive element of the crime,\" and as such must be proven by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Key,</i> 76 F.3d 350, 353 (11th Cir.1996); <i>see </i><i>United States v. Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 424 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>The government presented two items of evidence at trial to establish BPPR's federally-insured status: (1) a certificate of FDIC insurance issued to BPPR on January 2, 1999; and (2) testimony by BPPR's record custodian regarding the certificate. The record custodian's testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Q I would like to show you government's identification number 1. ... Without discussing the substance, do you recognize that document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q What do you recognize that to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A <i>This is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation certificate issued to Banco Popular Puerto Rico on January 1999.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q How do you know it is the same one at Banco Popular?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A My initials are on the back.</blockquote>\n<p>Appellant's App. 131-32 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Ayewoh did not object to admission of the certificate or to the record custodian's testimony, and he did not cross examine the witness. Nonetheless, Ayewoh questioned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*918</span> in closing arguments whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that BPPR was federally insured during March and April of 2006, the time frame of his criminal acts, and he subsequently moved for dismissal on these grounds. The district court treated Ayewoh's argument as a motion for acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 and denied the motion. The court concluded that, while an FDIC certificate issued in 1999 might by itself be insufficient to permit the jury to find that BPPR was federally insured in 2006, the addition of the record custodian's unobjected \"present tense\" testimony that the certificate \"is\" BPPR's FDIC certificate rendered the evidence sufficient. <i>United States v. Ayewoh,</i> 587 F.Supp.2d 378, 381 (D.P.R.2008). That is, the court interpreted the record custodian's statement as \"oral testimony that the bank was insured at the time of trial,\" which, when coupled with an FDIC certificate that predated the offense, could permit a rational jury to infer that BPPR was insured at the time of Ayewoh's crimes. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The FDIC certificate presented in this case, which predated Ayewoh's offenses by seven years, states: \"[FDIC] Washington, D.C., Hereby certifies that the deposits of each depositor in Banco Popular de Puerto Rico ... are insured to the maximum amount provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\" It further includes the official seal of the FDIC, signatures from both the FDIC's Executive Secretary and Chairman of the Board, BPPR's unique FDIC certificate number, and the date of January 2, 1999. No expiration date is listed because FDIC insurance never expires, but rather continues indefinitely until terminated voluntarily or involuntarily under 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a) [hereinafter Section 8(a)].</p>\n<p>Voluntary termination is not permissible for most banks. 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a)(1). Even involuntary termination for failure to pay the annual assessments (premiums) required by 12 U.S.C. § 1817(b), or for any other reason, is not automatic; it requires notice to the bank and a pre-termination hearing. 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a)(2)(B), (a)(3). Furthermore, for any termination under Section 8(a)whether voluntary or involuntarybanks are required to give individual notice to each of their depositors, 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a)(6), 12 C.F.R. § 307.3(a), and all deposits on the date of termination will continue to be insured for at least six months and up to two years, 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a)(7). In 2006, the year of Ayewoh's crimes, there were 8,755 banks insured by the FDIC. In the ten years from 1997 through the end of 2006, only two banks had their FDIC insurance terminated under Section 8(a)one voluntarily and one involuntarily.<sup>[2]</sup> Clearly, termination of FDIC insurance is an exceedingly rare event in the banking industry.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, there is a serious question as to whether an FDIC certificate that predates the offense by seven years is alone sufficient evidence of federal insurance. The Fifth and Seventh Circuits have overturned convictions where the only evidence of federal insurance was a single FDIC certificate which predated the offense, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Platenburg,</i> 657 F.2d 797, 799 (5th Cir.1981) (overturning conviction where only evidence of federal insurance was an FDIC certificate predating the offense by seven years); <i>United States v. Shively,</i> 715 F.2d 260, 265 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*919</span> (7th Cir.1983) (where only evidence was an FDIC certificate which predated the offense by nine years), and the Ninth and Tenth circuits have indicated their support for this view, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Chapel,</i> 41 F.3d 1338, 1340-41 (9th Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Darrell,</i> 828 F.2d 644, 648 (10th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>We need not decide in this case whether the FDIC certificate would alone be sufficient proof of federal insurance, for here there was also the testimony of BPPR's record custodian who testified that the certificate offered into evidence \"is the [FDIC] certificate issued to [BPPR] on January 1999.\" Appellant's App. 132. Here, the time between the alleged offenses and this trial testimony was approximately two and a half years.</p>\n<p>Generally, courts have found that testimony that a bank is insured at the time of trial can alone permit a reasonable jury to infer that the bank was insured at the time of the crime. For example, when presented with a bank vice president's testimony that the bank's deposits \"`are' FDIC-insured,\" the Second Circuit held</p>\n<blockquote>that where ... the evidence is oral testimony that the bank is insured, and the interval between the crime and the trial is not great, it is reasonable to conclude that \"viewed in context, the jury could draw the inference that the bank was insured at the time of the [crime],\"in other words, that th[e] jury could take \"is\" to mean \"is and has been.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Sliker,</i> 751 F.2d 477, 484-85 (2d Cir.1984) (internal citation omitted). This approach is widely accepted by the circuits. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Ware,</i> 416 F.3d 1118, 1121-23 (9th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Lewis,</i> 260 F.3d 855, 855-56 (8th Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Knop,</i> 701 F.2d 670, 672-73 (7th Cir.1983); <i>United States v. Safley,</i> 408 F.2d 603, 605 (4th Cir.1969); <i>Cook v. United States,</i> 320 F.2d 258, 259 (5th Cir.1963). <i>But see </i><i>United States v. Ali,</i> 266 F.3d 1242, 1244 n. 3 (9th Cir.2001) (finding testimony insufficient where time between trial and crime was too lengthy). Furthermore, courts have tended to accept any bank employee's testimony as sufficient, regardless of whether that employee was in a managerial position. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Bindley,</i> 157 F.3d 1235, 1239 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>However, Ayewoh contends in this case that the district court erred in interpreting the testimony of BPPR's record custodian as \"oral testimony that the bank was insured at the time of trial.\" <i>Ayewoh,</i> 587 F.Supp.2d at 381. Rather, Ayewoh argues that the custodian's testimony that the certificate offered by the government \"is the [FDIC] certificate issued to [BPPR] on January 1999\" should be construed as nothing more than merely attesting to the document's authenticity.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the bank employee's testimony is ambiguous and that reasonable minds could differ as to its interpretation. On one hand, the testimony could be read as meaning \"This is the [current FDIC] certificate [which was] issued to [BPPR] on January 1999.\" Alternately, as Ayewoh contends, the statement could reasonably be interpreted as mere authentication testimonythat is, to mean \"This is the [FDIC] certificate [which was] issued to [BPPR] on January 1999.\"</p>\n<p>This Court has previously stated that, \"[i]n reviewing a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, the Court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the Government, deferring to the jury's verdict if the evidence can support <i>varying interpretations,</i> at least one of which is consistent with the defendant's guilt.\" <i>United States v. Neal,</i> 36 F.3d 1190, 1203 (1st Cir.1994) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*920</span> (emphasis added).<sup>[3]</sup> This analysis \"does not require a court to ask itself whether <i>it</i> believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\" but rather whether \"<i>any</i> rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> 443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Therefore, we \"ought not to disturb, on the ground of insufficient evidence, a jury verdict that is supported by a <i>plausible rendition of the record.</i>\" <i>Wilder,</i> 526 F.3d at 8 (quoting <i>Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d at 711) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Thus, when reviewing evidence for sufficiency and considering ambiguous testimony that is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, we must construe the testimony in the light most favorable to the prosecution.<sup>[4]</sup> We must therefore presume that the jury interpreted the record custodian's testimony as a statement that the FDIC certificate offered into evidence indicated BPPR's presently-insured status as of the date of trial.</p>\n<p>As such, the ultimate question with respect to sufficiency in this case is whether a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that BPPR was federally-insured during March and April of 2006 (the time frame of Ayewoh's crimes), given the evidence of: (1) an FDIC insurance certificate issued to BPPR in 1999; and (2) testimony by BPPR's record custodian which, interpreted in the light most favorable to the government, asserted that the certificate remained a valid symbol of BPPR's federally-insured status at the time of trial. We join the vast majority of circuits in holding that such evidence is sufficient proof of FDIC insurance. That is, with evidence of FDIC insurance both at a time predating the offense and at the time of trial, a reasonable jury could infer that, absent evidence to the contrary, the bank was insured on the date of the crime.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*921</span> Consequently, we reject Ayewoh's contention that the government failed to offer sufficient proof of FDIC insurance. This is not to say that we endorse the prosecutor's handling of the case. The prosecutor assuredly couldand shouldhave done better. Federally insured status is easily proved in a garden-variety bank fraud case, and it is not too much to expect that the government will take the need to do so seriously. That said, however, we find the proof in this case adequate, if barely, as to that element of the offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Ayewoh next contends that he lacked the requisite mens rea for the crime charged. Under the bank fraud statute, the alleged scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution must have been undertaken <i>knowingly</i> by the defendant. 18 U.S.C. § 1344; <i>see also </i><i>Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d at 424. Ayewoh argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to prove he had knowledge that his actions would defraud BPPR itself, as opposed to the individual credit card holders. We disagree that the evidence was insufficient.</p>\n<p>When interpreting § 1344 in this circuit, \"[i]t has been established that the government does not have to show the alleged scheme was directed <i>solely</i> toward a particular institution; it is sufficient to show that [the] defendant knowingly ... exposed a ... bank to a <i>risk</i> of loss.\" <i>Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d at 426 (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Moran,</i> 312 F.3d 480, 489 (1st Cir.2002). \"`Intent to harm' [a bank] is not required,\" <i>United States v. Kenrick,</i> 221 F.3d 19, 29 (1st Cir.2000) (en banc), so \"[e]ven proof of an extremely remote risk will suffice.\" <i>United States v. Barakett,</i> 994 F.2d 1107, 1111 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, it is unnecessary that a defendant know \"which particular bank will be victimized by his fraud,\" so long as he \"knows that <i>a</i> [bank] will be defrauded\"even a bank that is not federally insured. <i>Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d at 426. As this Court stated in <i>Brandon,</i></p>\n<blockquote>Congress intended to criminalize bank frauds that harm federally insured banks, not just bank frauds directed specifically toward federally insured banks. As other courts have noted, the legislative history supports a broad construction of the statutory language of the bank fraud statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Defendants [cannot] ... sanitize their fraud by interposing an intermediary or an additional victim between their fraud and the federally insured bank.... The fact that it should turn out that [a] financial institution actually defrauded was federally insured is a fortuitous stroke of bad luck for the defendants but does not make it any less of a federal crime.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Thus, if a defendant merely knows that his fraudulent actions will expose some bank (whether or not federally insured) to a risk of loss, the mens rea requirement of § 1344 is satisfied.</p>\n<p>Ayewoh claims he \"had no way of knowing that [BPPR] would be held responsible to the issuing banks for chargebacks\" resulting from his unauthorized credit card transactions. Appellant's Br. 27. \"[T]he target of the scheme was not [BPPR],\" he contends, \"but [was] rather the credit card holders....\" Appellant's Br. 22. This argument lacks merit. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*922</span> Whether Ayewoh specifically knew BPPR would be liable to the issuing banks for chargebacks is irrelevant, for all § 1344 requires is knowledge that his fraudulent actions would expose some bank to a risk of loss. It is common knowledge that cardholders may generally disavow unauthorized charges on their credit card statements and avoid personal losses from fraud, thereby placing the risk of loss on a bank. A reasonable jury therefore could have concluded that Ayewoh knew his fraudulent actions would expose at least some bankwhether BPPR or even the foreign issuing banksto a risk of loss. For mens rea, § 1344 requires nothing more. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to find that Ayewoh defrauded BPPR while possessing the requisite mental state under the bank fraud statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>Ayewoh urges that there was not sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that he violated § 1344 by knowingly executing a scheme to obtain money from the custody of BPPR \"by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1344. Ayewoh contends that the act of entering a credit card number into a POS device is not a \"representation\" of anything. We disagree. The majority of our sister circuits have broadly held that the misrepresentation element of § 1344 is fulfilled by any intentional act or statement by an individual that falsely indicates, explicitly or implicitly, that he has authority to withdraw money from a bank.<sup>[6]</sup> We find that, by running credit card numbers through his POS device, Ayewoh at least implicitly represented to BPPR that he had the cardholders' authorization to make the charges. Here, as in other contexts, we are reluctant to adopt a construction of the statute that would exclude \"new financial instruments.\" <i>United States v. Agne,</i> 214 F.3d 47, 54 (1st Cir.2000). Moreover, it makes no difference that the agent of the bank defrauded by Ayewoh's deceit was a computer as opposed to a human teller. Without the implied representation that he was authorized to charge the credit cards at issue, BPPR assuredly would not have paid money into OIPA's account. Consequently, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Ayewoh acquired funds from BPPR through fraudulent misrepresentations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We turn finally to Ayewoh's contention that the prosecutor violated his Fifth Amendment rights by referring during closing arguments to Ayewoh's decision not to testify. The closing argument is \"an especially delicate point in the trial process,\" and we scrutinize the prosecutor's comments accordingly. <i>United States v. Glover,</i> 558 F.3d 71, 77 (1st Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*923</span> 2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir.1995)). In <i>Griffin v. California,</i> 380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), the Supreme Court held that \"comment on the [defendant's] refusal to testify\" burdens the constitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination and is therefore prohibited. To decide whether Ayewoh is entitled to relief, we engage in a two-pronged analysis: First, we conduct a de novo review to determine whether the prosecutor's comments offended the Fifth Amendment by improperly insinuating that Ayewoh's failure to testify constituted evidence of guilt. <i>Gomes v. Brady,</i> 564 F.3d 532, 537 (1st Cir.2009). To that end, \"we consider `whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 538 (quoting <i>United States v. Glantz,</i> 810 F.2d 316, 322 (1st Cir.1987)). Second, if we determine the comments were improper and the objection was preserved, we review for harmless error. <i>Glover,</i> 558 F.3d at 76.</p>\n<p>At trial, Ayewoh's counsel urged that Ayewoh did not knowingly defraud anyone because he believed at the time that he had obtained the credit cards legitimately from a \"friend of a friend\" who sought to invest in his company OIPA, Inc. Under this theory, the unidentified \"friend of a friend\" was the real criminal who defrauded innocent Ayewoh by purporting to be a legitimate investor. Though Ayewoh did not testify at trial, he proffered this defense through the testimony of his wife. BPPR's investigator Mr. Ponce also testified that Ayewoh stated during an interview that he had received the credit cards from a \"friend of a friend\" who was an investor in Europe and that the transaction had been done entirely through his friend. Appellant's App. 211. Finally, in closing arguments, Ayewoh's counsel repeatedly asserted that the purported \"friend of a friend\" was entirely to blame and that Ayewoh was himself an innocent victim of fraud. For context, we quote the relevant portions of defense counsel's closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he money was invested in OIPA, Inc., by this <i>friend of a friend.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Mr. Ayewoh committed a mistake, but that mistake was not defrauding anybody. That mistake was trying to grow and seeing an opportunity and grabbing it without looking at what was behind it, because somebody who knew that he was in need offered him his dream, I'll give you the money, here, start charging here. And he did.</blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., Oct. 14, 2008, ECF No. 84, at 28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote>[Ayewoh] got somebody to invest in his company, the company that he, with his wife, was developing so that he could make a better living for himself and also pay back his investors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>But he was defrauded.... And you'll say, but look at all those things that the government showed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>The government doesn't know if [Ayewoh] called his friend to find out, hey, these [credit cards] are being rejected, what's going on[?] And his friend told him, Oh, I gave you the wrong number. Oh, I need to deposit. Oh, I need to do something.</i></blockquote>\n<p>We don't know that. The government doesn't know that.</p>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 29 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote>Ladies and gentlemen, the mistake Mr. Ayewoh made was that he believed the <i>friend of a friend.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*924</span> Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 35 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote>It is a pity that [Ayewoh] didn't have a contract with this gentleman that lent him the money. If he had sought his attorney's advice at the moment, he would have had one.</blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 38.</p>\n<blockquote>Everything that surrounds this case shows that somebody tried to defraud the bank....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>But that somebody is not Mr. Ayewoh. That somebody is the person, the <i>friend of the friend</i> that gave him the credit card numbers. <i>We don't know who he is.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 40 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Seeking to cast doubt on Ayewoh's defense theory, the government made several comments in closing regarding the lack of a known identity for Ayewoh's purported \"friend of a friend.\" Specifically, Ayewoh contends that the following three comments made during the government's rebuttal argument violated his Fifth Amendment rights by improperly commenting on his failure to testify as to the alleged investor's identity:</p>\n<blockquote>[1] Okay. Let's say the defendant says it is a mistake. Well, you have an instruction on willful blindness. Was he willfully blind that these credit cards were, in fact, stolen[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Well, let's look at the defendant's statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A friend of a friend. To this day, to this day, you have heard from government witnesses, you have even heard from the defendant's spouse. <i>We still don't know who this friend of a friend is.</i> ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You are going to have, you know, an individual make over $100,000 worth of investments in your company and then not know who the person is. Not do an investment contract?</blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 46-47 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote>[2] It makes absolutely no sense that this defendant got these numbers from a friend of a friend, over 16 credit cards, start[ed] essentially doing the manual POS transactions, multiple times, and not know who that individual is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>We still don't know who that individual is. Gentleman who lent the money, we have no idea. We have no name.</i></blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 47-48 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote>[3] But here, in looking at all the evidenceand, you know, the defendant has argued that, now, this was a mistake, that he believed a friend of a friend. That it was a mistake, in believing a friend of a friend, that what he wanted to do was to get a good life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Well, this is not believable. Use your common sense. Okay. Common sense doesn'tit doesn't make sense. It is not a mistake that you get 17 credit card numbers from a person that you don't know, have no idea and then do multiple transactions over a short period of time in order to figure out what the credit limits of the credit cards are. You just don't do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Because if you have a friend of a friend who is actually giving you these numbers and you know who that friend is, you call that friend and you tell the friend, \"Listen, the credit card isn't working, what's happening, [is it] being declined for insufficient funds?\" <i>But you haven't heard evidence of that.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 51-52 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Ayewoh's counsel timely objected to the first of these remarks by requesting to approach the bench, but the court denied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*925</span> the request. Ayewoh subsequently moved for a mistrial \"based on the comments made by the prosecution as to the defendant's silence,\" but the court denied the motion as well. Ayewoh now contends on appeal that the prosecutor's comments were improper because only Ayewoh could have provided the identity of the \"friend of a friend,\" so references to the lack of such evidence necessarily pointed to his failure to testify. We disagree.</p>\n<p>First, contrary to Ayewoh's contention that only he could provide the identity of the \"friend of a friend,\" Ayewoh himself was not the only person who could identify the alleged investor if he existed. For example, the \"friend\" who purportedly acted as an intermediary between Ayewoh and the mysterious \"friend of a friend\" might have testified as to the investor's identity and to their business arrangement. Moreover, in his interview with the bank representative, Ayewoh reportedly stated that he never knew the identity of the \"friend of a friend\" because the deal was all done through an immediate friend. Appellant's App. at 211. Thus, this case is distinguishable from cases in which \"[n]o one but [the] appellant ... could have [testified]\" regarding the issue, <i>see </i><i>Desmond v. United States,</i> 345 F.2d 225, 227 (1st Cir. 1965), because here it was \"apparent on the record that there was someone other than himself whom the defendant could have called.\" <i>Id.</i> As such, the prosecutor's comments regarding the lack of such evidence in the record did not \"naturally and necessarily\" point to Ayewoh's failure to testify. <i>Gomes,</i> 564 F.3d at 538 (quoting <i>Glantz,</i> 810 F.2d at 322); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Wilkerson,</i> 411 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.2005) (prosecutor's comments that \"there's no real evidence\" and \"pretty much nothing\" to support defendant's theory did not \"naturally and necessarily\" comment on his failure to testify because they likely \"referred to [defendant's] failure to produce other evidence supporting his theory,\" or were at most ambiguous).</p>\n<p>Second, even if the prosecutor's remarks could be read as commenting on Ayewoh's failure to testify, the comments were a \"fair response\" to claims by the defendant. In <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 485 U.S. 25, 34, 108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988), the Supreme Court carved out an exception to <i>Griffin</i> for prosecutors who refer to a defendant's failure to testify while \"fairly responding to an argument of the defendant.\" In that case, the defense counsel asserted in closing arguments that the government had not given the defendant a chance to tell his side of the story. <i>Id.</i> at 27, 108 S.Ct. 864. On rebuttal, the prosecutor responded by informing the jury that the defendant \"could have taken the stand and explained it to you.\" <i>Id.</i> at 28, 108 S.Ct. 864. Finding no Fifth Amendment violation, the Supreme Court reasoned that, \"[w]here the prosecutor on his own initiative asks the jury to draw an adverse inference from a defendant's silence, <i>Griffin</i> holds that the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination is violated,\" but where the prosecutor's reference to the defendant's failure to testify is a \"fair response to a claim made by defendant or his counsel,\" the Fifth Amendment is not offended. <i>Id.</i> at 31-32, 108 S.Ct. 864. The Court further explained that \"the Fifth Amendment should [not] be converted into a sword that cuts back on the area of legitimate comment by the prosecutor on the weaknesses in the defense['s] case.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Hasting,</i> 461 U.S. 499, 515, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p>Following the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Robinson,</i> this Court has applied the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*926</span> \"fair response\" doctrine in numerous cases.<sup>[7]</sup> Likewise, our sister circuits have invoked the \"fair response\" doctrine to reject Fifth Amendment claims on similar facts.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>We find that <i>Robinson</i> controls in this case and that, viewed in context, the prosecutor's challenged comments were part of a \"fair response\" to the arguments made by Ayewoh's counsel. The first two challenged comments, which emphasized the lack of evidence regarding the identity of the purported \"friend of a friend,\" were permissible attacks on the plausibility of Ayewoh's defense theory. \"Having put forth a theory in [his] defense,\" Ayewoh \"[could not] expect the government to refrain from commenting on its deficiencies\" and the lack of evidentiary support for his theorynamely, that the record did not even include the identity of the mysterious person whom Ayewoh claimed he mistakenly believed \"invested\" over $122,000 in his company. The prosecution was permitted to highlight such a glaring weakness in the defense's case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*927</span> Similarly, it is clear that the prosecutor's third challenged comment, viewed in context, was a \"fair response\" specifically to the defense counsels comment that \"[t]he government doesn't know if [Ayewoh] called his friend to find out\" why some of the credit cards weren't working. Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 29. On rebuttal, the prosecutor's third comment fairly responded to the defense counsel's statement by informing the jury that \"you haven't heard evidence\" that Ayewoh placed any such calls to his friend. Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 52.</p>\n<p>Thus, because all of the prosecutor's challenged comments were made in \"fair response\" to claims by the defense, Ayewoh's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Ayewoh's conviction and sentence on the bank fraud and forfeiture counts.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>THOMPSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I am happy to join my colleagues' opinion except as to Section II.A. I cannot agree with their characterization of the evidence offered to show that BPPR was insured by the FDIC when Ayewoh defrauded BPPRa central element of the conviction. The record, containing only a seven-year-old FDIC certificate and its authenticating testimony, is too flimsy to support the interpretation that the majority constructs upon it. Where, as here, the government has failed to prove every element of the crime of which the defendant was charged beyond a reasonable doubt, his conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p>For more than thirty years now, prosecutors have been on notice that they must be as diligent in proving the FDIC insurance element of crimes like bank fraud as they are in proving any other element. In 1980, the Fifth Circuit expressed \"difficulty comprehending why the [g]overnment repeatedly fails to prove this element more carefully since [its] burden is so simple and straightforward,\" and warned the government that it \"treads perilously close to reversal.\" <i>United States v. Maner,</i> 611 F.2d 107, 112 (5th Cir.1980). With increasing exasperation, our sister circuits have since continuously issued warnings to the government, imploring it to take this requirement more seriously.<sup>[9]</sup> Eventually, they began reversing convictions where the government's measly evidentiary proffer could not have persuaded a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the financial institution at issue was FDIC-insured as of the offense date.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Though the line between sufficiency and insufficiency is by no means bright, its broad contours are readily discernible. On one side is a single FDIC certificate pre-dating the offense, which our sister circuits have uniformly rejected as insufficient. <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 918-19 (collecting cases). On the other side is the testimony of a bank employee to the effect that the bank is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*928</span> insured at the time of the trial, which is usually adequate. <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 918-19 (collecting cases). The central question, then, is this: did the government introduce enough evidence in this case to push the proof of insurance across that line? It is here that I depart from my colleagues' analysis.</p>\n<p>The majority parses the evidence of insurance into two separate pieces: the FDIC certificate and the testimony of BPPR's record-keeper. The certificate itself, as in <i>Shively</i> and <i>Platenburg,</i> was issued about seven years before Ayewoh's fraud. Because a jury cannot reasonably conclude, without something more, that the bank's insurance status has remained in force throughout the intervening years, <i>see </i><i>Shively,</i> 715 F.2d at 265, the certificate is insufficient. That leaves the record-keeper's testimony, which the majority insists provides enough proof of insurance that, when combined with the certificate, it pushes the quantum of evidence across the line.</p>\n<p>As my colleagues recognize, the jury's verdict must be \"supported by a plausible rendition of the record,\" <i>United States v. Wilder,</i> 526 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2008) (internal quotations omitted), and although \"the jury is entitled to choose among varying interpretations of the evidence[,] ... the interpretation it chooses [must be] a reasonable one,\" <i>United States v. Martinez,</i> 922 F.2d 914, 923 (1st Cir.1991). The factfinder does not have unfettered discretion to rely on any conceivable interpretation of the evidence. True, appellate courts must \"view the facts in the light most favorable to the [g]overnment,\" <i>United States v. Neal,</i> 36 F.3d 1190, 1203 (1st Cir.1994), but the touchstones are plausibility and reasonableness.</p>\n<p>Here is the entirety of the record-keeper's testimony:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: I would like to show you government's identification number 1. Let the record reflect that it has been shown to the defendant[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Without discussing the substance, do you recognize that document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: What do you recognize that to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: This is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation certificate issued to Banco Popular [de] Puerto Rico on January 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: How do you know it is the same one at Banco Popular?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: My initials are on the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Q:] Your Honor, we ask that government's exhibit 1 be admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p>The majority asserts that this exchange is amenable to multiple reasonable interpretations, including one that relates to BPPR's insurance status at the time of trial. <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 919-20. I disagree. Rather, the record-keeper's testimony merely authenticated the paper she was shown as the 1999 certificate. Once the government succeeded in entering the certificate into the record, it elicited no further testimony explaining the significance of the certificate.<sup>[11]</sup> The testimonial context <span class=\"star-pagination\">*929</span> reinforces that this is the only plausible interpretation. The record-keeper gave the key statement relied upon by the majority after being asked to identify the document \"[w]ithout discussing [its] substance....\" Moreover, immediately after the key statement, the government asked how she knew the document before her was the same one on file at BPPR, and she responded, \"My initials are on the back.\" The colloquy thus dealt only with the witness's personal knowledge of the physical certificate and <i>explicitly</i> stopped short of discussing its content, legal effect, ormost importantlycontinuing validity.</p>\n<p>The majority disagrees, suggesting that the key passage in the colloquy above could be interpreted by a rational juror to mean, \"This is the [current FDIC] certificate [which was] issued to [BPPR] on January 1999.\" <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 919 (alterations in original). But this interpretation imports meaning that the testimony itself does not support: the word \"current\" cannot be inferred from or found anywhere in either the statement or its testimonial context. Indeed, the statement conveys no information other than that the certificate is authentic and was issued in 1999.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>The majority also discusses the relative infrequency with which FDIC certificates are revoked. <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 918. While this information, in concert with other evidence, might buttress a jury's conclusion that a certificate remains valid, it is irrelevant here because it is nowhere in the record. When considering sufficiency claims, we consider only the evidence available to the factfinder, <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 65 (1st Cir.2008), because it is ultimately the jury that must find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, not a reviewing court. Of course, juries may rely upon their common sense and upon any fact in common knowledge in reaching a verdict. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maroules v. Jumbo, Inc.,</i> 452 F.3d 639, 644-45 (7th Cir.2006). But because the jury in this case was not made aware of the procedural and statistical details relating to the revocation of FDIC certificates, they should not inform our consideration of the sufficiency the government's proof. Unlike the majority's reasonable suggestion that \"[i]t is common knowledge that cardholders may generally disavow unauthorized charges on their credit card statements,\" <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 922, for example, it is hardly common knowledge that FDIC certificates are rarely revoked. Since we cannot assume that the intricacies of FDIC insurance are widely known, we cannot say that there was sufficient evidence to support the proposition that BPPR was insured when Ayewoh carried out his schemes.</p>\n<p>The government's failure to prove an indispensable element of the charged offense appears against a backdrop of both decades of warnings urging it to be more careful and notice after trial of the possibility of reversal.<sup>[13]</sup> In situations such as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*930</span> these, as Judge Posner explained, \"either the government proved every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt or it did not. If it did not, we must reverse; if it did, it is no business of ours that it could have put on an even stronger case.\" <i>Knop,</i> 701 F.2d at 677 (Posner, J., dissenting). Here, the government's deliberate oversight compels the reversal of Ayewoh's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p>I do not come to this conclusion lightly. Ayewoh admits to intending to defraud innocent credit card owners. He stole more than one hundred thousand dollars, some tens of thousands of which were either never recovered by BPPR or borne unreported by the victimized cardholders. Nevertheless, we should not allow the centuries-old proposition that all elements of a crime must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, <i>see </i><i>In re Winship,</i> 397 U.S. 358, 361, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), to be eroded slowly for expediency's sake.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Ayewoh himself notes that,\n</p>\n<p>[i]n a manual transaction the card is not present. The merchant will key in an account number that a person has given him and the transaction will be deposited in the merchant's account.

Op.</i> at 917, Ayewoh did not have any reason to \"object to admission of the certificate or to the record custodian's testimony\" or to \"cross examine the witness.\" An objection to evidence that was clearly foundational and properly framed would have been unnecessary if not inappropriate. And Ayewoh had no duty to cross-examine the record-keeper, especially when the exercise could only have assisted the prosecution. Instead, counsel properly adhered to cross-examination expert Irving Younger's well-regarded advice by leaving insufficient testimony alonenot asking one question too many and holding the prosecution to its burden of proof.</p>\n<p>[12]  While no analogy is perfect, the following might serve to illuminate this point. Imagine that a prosecutor, pointing to a defendant, asked a witness, \"Without saying anything substantive about him, do you recognize that man?\" If the witness responded, \"Yes I do, that is John Doe,\" it would be unreasonable for a jury (or a court) to interpret that statement as \"Yes I do, that is [murderer] John Doe.\" Adding a single word can make a world of difference.</p>\n<p>[13]  Both Ayewoh and the district court alerted the government to the infirmity of the evidence it adduced to prove the insurance element. When Ayewoh filed his motion for acquittal, he pointed out the numerous exhortations from the courts of appeals not to treat cavalierly the necessity of providing such proof. At that point, had the government simply moved to reopen the case and provided any one of a myriad of other pieces of evidence to substantiate its claim, Ayewoh's conviction would be unassailable. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mojica-Baez,</i> 229 F.3d 292, 299-300 (1st Cir.2000) (approving that practice). For example, the government could have asked the record-keeper whether she had searched for any documents that superseded or rescinded the certificate. <i>See </i><i>Neal,</i> 36 F.3d at 1207 n. 22. It could have called BPPR's manager to ask whether the company was insured. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vachon,</i> 869 F.2d 653, 657 (1st Cir.1989). It could even have introduced into evidence \"the cancelled check for the [insurance premium for the] period of time covering\" the offense. <i>Maner,</i> 611 F.2d at 112 n. 2.

On appeal Ayewoh contends that the government provided insufficient evidence that the defrauded bank, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (\"BPPR\"), was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") at the time of the crimes; that Ayewoh knowingly defrauded BPPR; or that Ayewoh made misrepresentations to BPPR. Ayewoh further contends that the prosecutor violated his Fifth Amendment rights by referring to his decision not to testify. We reject these contentions and affirm Ayewoh's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>In 2005, Ayewoh established OIPA, Inc., as a for profit corporation in Puerto Rico to provide inspection services at public housing projects for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). Ayewoh was the President of the corporation, and his wife was the Secretary. In OIPA's name, Ayewoh acquired a credit card point-of-sale device (\"POS device\") and a merchant's account at BPPR. A POS device allows a merchant to accept credit card payments either electronically (by swiping a card's magnetic strip through the device) or manually (by entering a card's number with a keypad).<sup>[1]</sup> HUD's method of payment for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*916</span> OIPA's inspection services included providing Ayewoh with a credit card number and authorizing him to perform manual transactions. However, the government presented evidence at trial that Ayewoh used the POS device to execute numerous unauthorized manual transactions using other credit card numbers, many of which belonged to cards issued by foreign banks. The defense's theory was that Ayewoh innocently believed that the credit card charges made to the POS device were authorized by the cardholders as legitimate investments in a new real estate venture. In order to understand the respective theories, some understanding of industry practice and Ayewoh's own activities is required.</p>\n<p>When a credit card transaction executed on a POS device is accepted by the bank that issued the card (\"issuing bank\"), the payment is deposited directly into the merchant's bank account (at the \"acquiring bank\"). In the event that a cardholder disputes a transaction, contractual agreements with credit card providers such as Visa and MasterCard permit the issuing bank to initiate a \"chargeback\" whereby the acquiring bank is liable to the issuing bank for the full amount of the disputed charge. The acquiring bank, in turn, looks to the merchant for reimbursement.</p>\n<p>Ayewoh was the only person with access to OIPA's POS device. For several months, Ayewoh, using the POS device, processed relatively small charges, with monthly totals ranging from $1,045 in February 2006, to $9,135 in March 2006. However, in April 2006, OIPA's account received $113,070 in payments from at least sixteen different credit cards. BPPR's records showed numerous instances in which OIPA's POS device attempted to run a large transaction, which was declined, and then it immediately attempted several additional transactions with the same credit card for progressively smaller amounts. Upon detecting this suspicious activity, BPPR froze OIPA's account and sent investigators to question Ayewoh. When asked how he obtained the credit card numbers at issue, Ayewoh claimed he received a list of numbers from a \"friend of a friend\" in Europe who wanted to invest in a new housing development project Ayewoh had planned for OIPA. Though repeatedly asked, Ayewoh declined to provide information about the project and stated that he did not know the identity of the alleged investor.</p>\n<p>Soon thereafter the banks that issued the credit cards in question began notifying BPPR that Ayewoh's March and April charges were unauthorized. BPPR subsequently returned $122,104 in chargebacks to the issuing banks. Of this $122,104, BPPR was only able to recover about $100,000 from Ayewoh, who had withdrawn large amounts before his account was frozen. BPPR suffered a net loss of $19,644.</p>\n<p>Ayewoh was indicted by a grand jury in November 2007 on one count of bank fraud, charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344, and one forfeiture count, charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 981(a)(1)(C) and 982(a)(2). After a jury trial in October 2008, Ayewoh was convicted and sentenced to thirty months in prison to be followed by five years of supervised release. He was further ordered to pay restitution to BPPR in the amount of its losses. Ayewoh timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*917</span> II.</h2>\n<p>Ayewoh does not dispute that the evidence established that he made unauthorized charges to the credit cards at issue. However, Ayewoh contends on appeal that the government failed to prove all of the essential elements of the bank fraud offense. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1344. Specifically, he claims that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to permit a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that BPPR was insured by the FDIC at the time of his crimes; (2) that Ayewoh had the requisite knowledge that he was defrauding BPPR (as opposed to the individual credit card owners); or (3) that he made misrepresentations to BPPR. We review sufficiency claims de novo, \"affirm[ing] the conviction if, after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the elements of the crime.\" <i>United States v. Wilder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203285\"><a href=\"/opinion/203285/united-states-v-wilder/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7-8 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200598\"><a href=\"/opinion/200598/united-states-v-connolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2003)). We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Ayewoh first contends that the government failed to present sufficient evidence at trial to establish that BPPR was insured by the FDIC at the time of his crimes. The bank fraud statute at issue punishes the</p>\n<blockquote>knowing[] execut[ion] ... [of] a scheme or artifice(1) to defraud a financial institution; or (2) to obtain any of the moneys ... owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 1344. The term \"financial institution\" as used in Title 18 is defined in relevant part as \"an insured depository institution (as defined in section 3(c)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act).\" 18 U.S.C. § 20. Section 3(c)(2) in turn defines \"insured depository institution\" as \"any bank or savings association the deposits of which are insured by the [FDIC] pursuant to [the Federal Deposit Insurance Act].\" 12 U.S.C. § 1813(c)(2). Thus, under § 1344, the defrauded financial institution's federally-insured status is \"a jurisdictional prerequisite as well as a substantive element of the crime,\" and as such must be proven by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Key,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70665\"><a href=\"/opinion/70665/united-states-v-key/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 353 (11th Cir.1996); <i>see </i><i>United States v. Brandon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 424 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>The government presented two items of evidence at trial to establish BPPR's federally-insured status: (1) a certificate of FDIC insurance issued to BPPR on January 2, 1999; and (2) testimony by BPPR's record custodian regarding the certificate. The record custodian's testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Q I would like to show you government's identification number 1. ... Without discussing the substance, do you recognize that document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q What do you recognize that to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A <i>This is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation certificate issued to Banco Popular Puerto Rico on January 1999.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q How do you know it is the same one at Banco Popular?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A My initials are on the back.</blockquote>\n<p>Appellant's App. 131-32 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Ayewoh did not object to admission of the certificate or to the record custodian's testimony, and he did not cross examine the witness. Nonetheless, Ayewoh questioned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*918</span> in closing arguments whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that BPPR was federally insured during March and April of 2006, the time frame of his criminal acts, and he subsequently moved for dismissal on these grounds. The district court treated Ayewoh's argument as a motion for acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 and denied the motion. The court concluded that, while an FDIC certificate issued in 1999 might by itself be insufficient to permit the jury to find that BPPR was federally insured in 2006, the addition of the record custodian's unobjected \"present tense\" testimony that the certificate \"is\" BPPR's FDIC certificate rendered the evidence sufficient. <i>United States v. Ayewoh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521930\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521930/united-states-v-ayewoh/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span>, 381 (D.P.R.2008). That is, the court interpreted the record custodian's statement as \"oral testimony that the bank was insured at the time of trial,\" which, when coupled with an FDIC certificate that predated the offense, could permit a rational jury to infer that BPPR was insured at the time of Ayewoh's crimes. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The FDIC certificate presented in this case, which predated Ayewoh's offenses by seven years, states: \"[FDIC] Washington, D.C., Hereby certifies that the deposits of each depositor in Banco Popular de Puerto Rico ... are insured to the maximum amount provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\" It further includes the official seal of the FDIC, signatures from both the FDIC's Executive Secretary and Chairman of the Board, BPPR's unique FDIC certificate number, and the date of January 2, 1999. No expiration date is listed because FDIC insurance never expires, but rather continues indefinitely until terminated voluntarily or involuntarily under 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a) [hereinafter Section 8(a)].</p>\n<p>Voluntary termination is not permissible for most banks. 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a)(1). Even involuntary termination for failure to pay the annual assessments (premiums) required by 12 U.S.C. § 1817(b), or for any other reason, is not automatic; it requires notice to the bank and a pre-termination hearing. 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a)(2)(B), (a)(3). Furthermore, for any termination under Section 8(a)whether voluntary or involuntarybanks are required to give individual notice to each of their depositors, 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a)(6), 12 C.F.R. § 307.3(a), and all deposits on the date of termination will continue to be insured for at least six months and up to two years, 12 U.S.C. § 1818(a)(7). In 2006, the year of Ayewoh's crimes, there were 8,755 banks insured by the FDIC. In the ten years from 1997 through the end of 2006, only two banks had their FDIC insurance terminated under Section 8(a)one voluntarily and one involuntarily.<sup>[2]</sup> Clearly, termination of FDIC insurance is an exceedingly rare event in the banking industry.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, there is a serious question as to whether an FDIC certificate that predates the offense by seven years is alone sufficient evidence of federal insurance. The Fifth and Seventh Circuits have overturned convictions where the only evidence of federal insurance was a single FDIC certificate which predated the offense, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Platenburg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393719\"><a href=\"/opinion/393719/united-states-v-jake-p-platenburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span>, 799 (5th Cir.1981) (overturning conviction where only evidence of federal insurance was an FDIC certificate predating the offense by seven years); <i>United States v.

Here, the time between the alleged offenses and this trial testimony was approximately two and a half years.</p>\n<p>Generally, courts have found that testimony that a bank is insured at the time of trial can alone permit a reasonable jury to infer that the bank was insured at the time of the crime. For example, when presented with a bank vice president's testimony that the bank's deposits \"`are' FDIC-insured,\" the Second Circuit held</p>\n<blockquote>that where ... the evidence is oral testimony that the bank is insured, and the interval between the crime and the trial is not great, it is reasonable to conclude that \"viewed in context, the jury could draw the inference that the bank was insured at the time of the [crime],\"in other words, that th[e] jury could take \"is\" to mean \"is and has been.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v.

Furthermore, courts have tended to accept any bank employee's testimony as sufficient, regardless of whether that employee was in a managerial position. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Bindley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758534\"><a href=\"/opinion/758534/united-states-v-gary-joseph-bindley/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1235</span></a></span>, 1239 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>However, Ayewoh contends in this case that the district court erred in interpreting the testimony of BPPR's record custodian as \"oral testimony that the bank was insured at the time of trial.\" <i>Ayewoh,</i> 587 F.Supp.2d at 381. Rather, Ayewoh argues that the custodian's testimony that the certificate offered by the government \"is the [FDIC] certificate issued to [BPPR] on January 1999\" should be construed as nothing more than merely attesting to the document's authenticity.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the bank employee's testimony is ambiguous and that reasonable minds could differ as to its interpretation. On one hand, the testimony could be read as meaning \"This is the [current FDIC] certificate [which was] issued to [BPPR] on January 1999.\" Alternately, as Ayewoh contends, the statement could reasonably be interpreted as mere authentication testimonythat is, to mean \"This is the [FDIC] certificate [which was] issued to [BPPR] on January 1999.\"</p>\n<p>This Court has previously stated that, \"[i]n reviewing a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, the Court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the Government, deferring to the jury's verdict if the evidence can support <i>varying interpretations,</i> at least one of which is consistent with the defendant's guilt.\" <i>United States v.

Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 318-19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span> (1979) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Therefore, we \"ought not to disturb, on the ground of insufficient evidence, a jury verdict that is supported by a <i>plausible rendition of the record.</i>\" <i>Wilder,</i> 526 F.3d at 8 (quoting <i>Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d at 711) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Thus, when reviewing evidence for sufficiency and considering ambiguous testimony that is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, we must construe the testimony in the light most favorable to the prosecution.<sup>[4]</sup> We must therefore presume that the jury interpreted the record custodian's testimony as a statement that the FDIC certificate offered into evidence indicated BPPR's presently-insured status as of the date of trial.</p>\n<p>As such, the ultimate question with respect to sufficiency in this case is whether a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that BPPR was federally-insured during March and April of 2006 (the time frame of Ayewoh's crimes), given the evidence of: (1) an FDIC insurance certificate issued to BPPR in 1999; and (2) testimony by BPPR's record custodian which, interpreted in the light most favorable to the government, asserted that the certificate remained a valid symbol of BPPR's federally-insured status at the time of trial. We join the vast majority of circuits in holding that such evidence is sufficient proof of FDIC insurance. That is, with evidence of FDIC insurance both at a time predating the offense and at the time of trial, a reasonable jury could infer that, absent evidence to the contrary, the bank was insured on the date of the crime.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*921</span> Consequently, we reject Ayewoh's contention that the government failed to offer sufficient proof of FDIC insurance. This is not to say that we endorse the prosecutor's handling of the case. The prosecutor assuredly couldand shouldhave done better. Federally insured status is easily proved in a garden-variety bank fraud case, and it is not too much to expect that the government will take the need to do so seriously. That said, however, we find the proof in this case adequate, if barely, as to that element of the offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Ayewoh next contends that he lacked the requisite mens rea for the crime charged. Under the bank fraud statute, the alleged scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution must have been undertaken <i>knowingly</i> by the defendant. 18 U.S.C. § 1344; <i>see also </i><i>Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d at 424. Ayewoh argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to prove he had knowledge that his actions would defraud BPPR itself, as opposed to the individual credit card holders. We disagree that the evidence was insufficient.</p>\n<p>When interpreting § 1344 in this circuit, \"[i]t has been established that the government does not have to show the alleged scheme was directed <i>solely</i> toward a particular institution; it is sufficient to show that [the] defendant knowingly ... exposed a ... bank to a <i>risk</i> of loss.\" <i>Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d at 426 (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780048\"><a href=\"/opinion/780048/united-states-v-john-moran-and-nora-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 489 (1st Cir.2002). \"`Intent to harm' [a bank] is not required,\" <i>United States v. Kenrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199023\"><a href=\"/opinion/199023/united-states-v-kenrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2000) (en banc), so \"[e]ven proof of an extremely remote risk will suffice.\" <i>United States v. Barakett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608098\"><a href=\"/opinion/608098/united-states-v-alfred-fred-barakett-aka-robert-john-koch-and-john-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1107</span></a></span>, 1111 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, it is unnecessary that a defendant know \"which particular bank will be victimized by his fraud,\" so long as he \"knows that <i>a</i> [bank] will be defrauded\"even a bank that is not federally insured. <i>Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d at 426. As this Court stated in <i>Brandon,</i></p>\n<blockquote>Congress intended to criminalize bank frauds that harm federally insured banks, not just bank frauds directed specifically toward federally insured banks. As other courts have noted, the legislative history supports a broad construction of the statutory language of the bank fraud statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Defendants [cannot] ... sanitize their fraud by interposing an intermediary or an additional victim between their fraud and the federally insured bank.... The fact that it should turn out that [a] financial institution actually defrauded was federally insured is a fortuitous stroke of bad luck for the defendants but does not make it any less of a federal crime.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Thus, if a defendant merely knows that his fraudulent actions will expose some bank (whether or not federally insured) to a risk of loss, the mens rea requirement of § 1344 is satisfied.</p>\n<p>Ayewoh claims he \"had no way of knowing that [BPPR] would be held responsible to the issuing banks for chargebacks\" resulting from his unauthorized credit card transactions. Appellant's Br. 27. \"[T]he target of the scheme was not [BPPR],\" he contends, \"but [was] rather the credit card holders....\" Appellant's Br. 22. This argument lacks merit. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*922</span> Whether Ayewoh specifically knew BPPR would be liable to the issuing banks for chargebacks is irrelevant, for all § 1344 requires is knowledge that his fraudulent actions would expose some bank to a risk of loss. It is common knowledge that cardholders may generally disavow unauthorized charges on their credit card statements and avoid personal losses from fraud, thereby placing the risk of loss on a bank. A reasonable jury therefore could have concluded that Ayewoh knew his fraudulent actions would expose at least some bankwhether BPPR or even the foreign issuing banksto a risk of loss. For mens rea, § 1344 requires nothing more. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to find that Ayewoh defrauded BPPR while possessing the requisite mental state under the bank fraud statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>Ayewoh urges that there was not sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that he violated § 1344 by knowingly executing a scheme to obtain money from the custody of BPPR \"by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1344. Ayewoh contends that the act of entering a credit card number into a POS device is not a \"representation\" of anything. We disagree. The majority of our sister circuits have broadly held that the misrepresentation element of § 1344 is fulfilled by any intentional act or statement by an individual that falsely indicates, explicitly or implicitly, that he has authority to withdraw money from a bank.<sup>[6]</sup> We find that, by running credit card numbers through his POS device, Ayewoh at least implicitly represented to BPPR that he had the cardholders' authorization to make the charges. Here, as in other contexts, we are reluctant to adopt a construction of the statute that would exclude \"new financial instruments.\" <i>United States v. Agne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198949\"><a href=\"/opinion/198949/united-states-v-agne/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2000). Moreover, it makes no difference that the agent of the bank defrauded by Ayewoh's deceit was a computer as opposed to a human teller. Without the implied representation that he was authorized to charge the credit cards at issue, BPPR assuredly would not have paid money into OIPA's account. Consequently, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Ayewoh acquired funds from BPPR through fraudulent misrepresentations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We turn finally to Ayewoh's contention that the prosecutor violated his Fifth Amendment rights by referring during closing arguments to Ayewoh's decision not to testify. The closing argument is \"an especially delicate point in the trial process,\" and we scrutinize the prosecutor's comments accordingly. <i>United States v. Glover,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203740\"><a href=\"/opinion/203740/united-states-v-glover/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*923</span> 2009) (quoting <i>United States v.

To decide whether Ayewoh is entitled to relief, we engage in a two-pronged analysis: First, we conduct a de novo review to determine whether the prosecutor's comments offended the Fifth Amendment by improperly insinuating that Ayewoh's failure to testify constituted evidence of guilt. <i>Gomes v. Brady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203808\"><a href=\"/opinion/203808/gomes-v-brady/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 537 (1st Cir.2009). To that end, \"we consider `whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 538 (quoting <i>United States v. Glantz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482473\"><a href=\"/opinion/482473/united-states-v-ronald-h-glantz-and-anthony-j-bucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>, 322 (1st Cir.1987)). Second, if we determine the comments were improper and the objection was preserved, we review for harmless error. <i>Glover,</i> 558 F.3d at 76.</p>\n<p>At trial, Ayewoh's counsel urged that Ayewoh did not knowingly defraud anyone because he believed at the time that he had obtained the credit cards legitimately from a \"friend of a friend\" who sought to invest in his company OIPA, Inc. Under this theory, the unidentified \"friend of a friend\" was the real criminal who defrauded innocent Ayewoh by purporting to be a legitimate investor. Though Ayewoh did not testify at trial, he proffered this defense through the testimony of his wife. BPPR's investigator Mr. Ponce also testified that Ayewoh stated during an interview that he had received the credit cards from a \"friend of a friend\" who was an investor in Europe and that the transaction had been done entirely through his friend. Appellant's App. 211. Finally, in closing arguments, Ayewoh's counsel repeatedly asserted that the purported \"friend of a friend\" was entirely to blame and that Ayewoh was himself an innocent victim of fraud. For context, we quote the relevant portions of defense counsel's closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he money was invested in OIPA, Inc., by this <i>friend of a friend.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Mr. Ayewoh committed a mistake, but that mistake was not defrauding anybody. That mistake was trying to grow and seeing an opportunity and grabbing it without looking at what was behind it, because somebody who knew that he was in need offered him his dream, I'll give you the money, here, start charging here. And he did.</blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., Oct. 14, 2008, ECF No. 84, at 28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote>[Ayewoh] got somebody to invest in his company, the company that he, with his wife, was developing so that he could make a better living for himself and also pay back his investors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>But he was defrauded.... And you'll say, but look at all those things that the government showed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>The government doesn't know if [Ayewoh] called his friend to find out, hey, these [credit cards] are being rejected, what's going on[?] And his friend told him, Oh, I gave you the wrong number. Oh, I need to deposit. Oh, I need to do something.</i></blockquote>\n<p>We don't know that. The government doesn't know that.</p>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 29 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote>Ladies and gentlemen, the mistake Mr. Ayewoh made was that he believed the <i>friend of a friend.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*924</span> Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 35 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote>It is a pity that [Ayewoh] didn't have a contract with this gentleman that lent him the money. If he had sought his attorney's advice at the moment, he would have had one.</blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 38.</p>\n<blockquote>Everything that surrounds this case shows that somebody tried to defraud the bank....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>But that somebody is not Mr. Ayewoh. That somebody is the person, the <i>friend of the friend</i> that gave him the credit card numbers. <i>We don't know who he is.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 40 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Seeking to cast doubt on Ayewoh's defense theory, the government made several comments in closing regarding the lack of a known identity for Ayewoh's purported \"friend of a friend.\" Specifically, Ayewoh contends that the following three comments made during the government's rebuttal argument violated his Fifth Amendment rights by improperly commenting on his failure to testify as to the alleged investor's identity:</p>\n<blockquote>[1] Okay. Let's say the defendant says it is a mistake. Well, you have an instruction on willful blindness. Was he willfully blind that these credit cards were, in fact, stolen[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Well, let's look at the defendant's statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A friend of a friend. To this day, to this day, you have heard from government witnesses, you have even heard from the defendant's spouse. <i>We still don't know who this friend of a friend is.</i> ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You are going to have, you know, an individual make over $100,000 worth of investments in your company and then not know who the person is. Not do an investment contract?</blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 46-47 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote>[2] It makes absolutely no sense that this defendant got these numbers from a friend of a friend, over 16 credit cards, start[ed] essentially doing the manual POS transactions, multiple times, and not know who that individual is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>We still don't know who that individual is. Gentleman who lent the money, we have no idea. We have no name.</i></blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 47-48 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote>[3] But here, in looking at all the evidenceand, you know, the defendant has argued that, now, this was a mistake, that he believed a friend of a friend. That it was a mistake, in believing a friend of a friend, that what he wanted to do was to get a good life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Well, this is not believable. Use your common sense. Okay. Common sense doesn'tit doesn't make sense. It is not a mistake that you get 17 credit card numbers from a person that you don't know, have no idea and then do multiple transactions over a short period of time in order to figure out what the credit limits of the credit cards are. You just don't do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Because if you have a friend of a friend who is actually giving you these numbers and you know who that friend is, you call that friend and you tell the friend, \"Listen, the credit card isn't working, what's happening, [is it] being declined for insufficient funds?\" <i>But you haven't heard evidence of that.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 51-52 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Ayewoh's counsel timely objected to the first of these remarks by requesting to approach the bench, but the court denied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*925</span> the request. Ayewoh subsequently moved for a mistrial \"based on the comments made by the prosecution as to the defendant's silence,\" but the court denied the motion as well. Ayewoh now contends on appeal that the prosecutor's comments were improper because only Ayewoh could have provided the identity of the \"friend of a friend,\" so references to the lack of such evidence necessarily pointed to his failure to testify. We disagree.</p>\n<p>First, contrary to Ayewoh's contention that only he could provide the identity of the \"friend of a friend,\" Ayewoh himself was not the only person who could identify the alleged investor if he existed. For example, the \"friend\" who purportedly acted as an intermediary between Ayewoh and the mysterious \"friend of a friend\" might have testified as to the investor's identity and to their business arrangement. Moreover, in his interview with the bank representative, Ayewoh reportedly stated that he never knew the identity of the \"friend of a friend\" because the deal was all done through an immediate friend. Appellant's App. at 211. Thus, this case is distinguishable from cases in which \"[n]o one but [the] appellant ... could have [testified]\" regarding the issue, <i>see </i><i>Desmond v.

The first two challenged comments, which emphasized the lack of evidence regarding the identity of the purported \"friend of a friend,\" were permissible attacks on the plausibility of Ayewoh's defense theory. \"Having put forth a theory in [his] defense,\" Ayewoh \"[could not] expect the government to refrain from commenting on its deficiencies\" and the lack of evidentiary support for his theorynamely, that the record did not even include the identity of the mysterious person whom Ayewoh claimed he mistakenly believed \"invested\" over $122,000 in his company. The prosecution was permitted to highlight such a glaring weakness in the defense's case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*927</span> Similarly, it is clear that the prosecutor's third challenged comment, viewed in context, was a \"fair response\" specifically to the defense counsels comment that \"[t]he government doesn't know if [Ayewoh] called his friend to find out\" why some of the credit cards weren't working. Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 29. On rebuttal, the prosecutor's third comment fairly responded to the defense counsel's statement by informing the jury that \"you haven't heard evidence\" that Ayewoh placed any such calls to his friend. Trial Tr., ECF No. 84, at 52.</p>\n<p>Thus, because all of the prosecutor's challenged comments were made in \"fair response\" to claims by the defense, Ayewoh's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Ayewoh's conviction and sentence on the bank fraud and forfeiture counts.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>THOMPSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I am happy to join my colleagues' opinion except as to Section II.A. I cannot agree with their characterization of the evidence offered to show that BPPR was insured by the FDIC when Ayewoh defrauded BPPRa central element of the conviction. The record, containing only a seven-year-old FDIC certificate and its authenticating testimony, is too flimsy to support the interpretation that the majority constructs upon it. Where, as here, the government has failed to prove every element of the crime of which the defendant was charged beyond a reasonable doubt, his conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p>For more than thirty years now, prosecutors have been on notice that they must be as diligent in proving the FDIC insurance element of crimes like bank fraud as they are in proving any other element. In 1980, the Fifth Circuit expressed \"difficulty comprehending why the [g]overnment repeatedly fails to prove this element more carefully since [its] burden is so simple and straightforward,\" and warned the government that it \"treads perilously close to reversal.\" <i>United States v. Maner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"372585\"><a href=\"/opinion/372585/united-states-v-grady-james-maner/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 112 (5th Cir.1980). With increasing exasperation, our sister circuits have since continuously issued warnings to the government, imploring it to take this requirement more seriously.<sup>[9]</sup> Eventually, they began reversing convictions where the government's measly evidentiary proffer could not have persuaded a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the financial institution at issue was FDIC-insured as of the offense date.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Though the line between sufficiency and insufficiency is by no means bright, its broad contours are readily discernible. On one side is a single FDIC certificate pre-dating the offense, which our sister circuits have uniformly rejected as insufficient. <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 918-19 (collecting cases). On the other side is the testimony of a bank employee to the effect that the bank is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*928</span> insured at the time of the trial, which is usually adequate. <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 918-19 (collecting cases). The central question, then, is this: did the government introduce enough evidence in this case to push the proof of insurance across that line? It is here that I depart from my colleagues' analysis.</p>\n<p>The majority parses the evidence of insurance into two separate pieces: the FDIC certificate and the testimony of BPPR's record-keeper. The certificate itself, as in <i>Shively</i> and <i>Platenburg,</i> was issued about seven years before Ayewoh's fraud. Because a jury cannot reasonably conclude, without something more, that the bank's insurance status has remained in force throughout the intervening years, <i>see </i><i>Shively,</i> 715 F.2d at 265, the certificate is insufficient. That leaves the record-keeper's testimony, which the majority insists provides enough proof of insurance that, when combined with the certificate, it pushes the quantum of evidence across the line.</p>\n<p>As my colleagues recognize, the jury's verdict must be \"supported by a plausible rendition of the record,\" <i>United States v. Wilder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203285\"><a href=\"/opinion/203285/united-states-v-wilder/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2008) (internal quotations omitted), and although \"the jury is entitled to choose among varying interpretations of the evidence[,] ... the interpretation it chooses [must be] a reasonable one,\" <i>United States v. Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553838\"><a href=\"/opinion/553838/united-states-v-victor-martinez-united-states-of-america-v-hector-vidal/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 923 (1st Cir.1991). The factfinder does not have unfettered discretion to rely on any conceivable interpretation of the evidence. True, appellate courts must \"view the facts in the light most favorable to the [g]overnment,\" <i>United States v. Neal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679500\"><a href=\"/opinion/679500/united-states-v-gary-p-neal-united-states-v-william-f-kenney-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span>, 1203 (1st Cir.1994), but the touchstones are plausibility and reasonableness.</p>\n<p>Here is the entirety of the record-keeper's testimony:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: I would like to show you government's identification number 1. Let the record reflect that it has been shown to the defendant[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Without discussing the substance, do you recognize that document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: What do you recognize that to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: This is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation certificate issued to Banco Popular [de] Puerto Rico on January 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: How do you know it is the same one at Banco Popular?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: My initials are on the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Q:] Your Honor, we ask that government's exhibit 1 be admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p>The majority asserts that this exchange is amenable to multiple reasonable interpretations, including one that relates to BPPR's insurance status at the time of trial. <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 919-20. I disagree. Rather, the record-keeper's testimony merely authenticated the paper she was shown as the 1999 certificate. Once the government succeeded in entering the certificate into the record, it elicited no further testimony explaining the significance of the certificate.<sup>[11]</sup> The testimonial context <span class=\"star-pagination\">*929</span> reinforces that this is the only plausible interpretation. The record-keeper gave the key statement relied upon by the majority after being asked to identify the document \"[w]ithout discussing [its] substance....\" Moreover, immediately after the key statement, the government asked how she knew the document before her was the same one on file at BPPR, and she responded, \"My initials are on the back.\" The colloquy thus dealt only with the witness's personal knowledge of the physical certificate and <i>explicitly</i> stopped short of discussing its content, legal effect, ormost importantlycontinuing validity.</p>\n<p>The majority disagrees, suggesting that the key passage in the colloquy above could be interpreted by a rational juror to mean, \"This is the [current FDIC] certificate [which was] issued to [BPPR] on January 1999.\" <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 919 (alterations in original). But this interpretation imports meaning that the testimony itself does not support: the word \"current\" cannot be inferred from or found anywhere in either the statement or its testimonial context. Indeed, the statement conveys no information other than that the certificate is authentic and was issued in 1999.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>The majority also discusses the relative infrequency with which FDIC certificates are revoked. <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 918. While this information, in concert with other evidence, might buttress a jury's conclusion that a certificate remains valid, it is irrelevant here because it is nowhere in the record. When considering sufficiency claims, we consider only the evidence available to the factfinder, <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203344\"><a href=\"/opinion/203344/united-states-v-decologero/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2008), because it is ultimately the jury that must find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, not a reviewing court. Of course, juries may rely upon their common sense and upon any fact in common knowledge in reaching a verdict. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maroules v. Jumbo, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794763\"><a href=\"/opinion/794763/christine-maroules-v-jumbo-inc-and-james-e-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span>, 644-45 (7th Cir.2006). But because the jury in this case was not made aware of the procedural and statistical details relating to the revocation of FDIC certificates, they should not inform our consideration of the sufficiency the government's proof. Unlike the majority's reasonable suggestion that \"[i]t is common knowledge that cardholders may generally disavow unauthorized charges on their credit card statements,\" <i>Maj. Op.</i> at 922, for example, it is hardly common knowledge that FDIC certificates are rarely revoked. Since we cannot assume that the intricacies of FDIC insurance are widely known, we cannot say that there was sufficient evidence to support the proposition that BPPR was insured when Ayewoh carried out his schemes.</p>\n<p>The government's failure to prove an indispensable element of the charged offense appears against a backdrop of both decades of warnings urging it to be more careful and notice after trial of the possibility of reversal.<sup>[13]</sup> In situations such as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*930</span> these, as Judge Posner explained, \"either the government proved every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt or it did not. If it did not, we must reverse; if it did, it is no business of ours that it could have put on an even stronger case.\" <i>Knop,</i> 701 F.2d at 677 (Posner, J., dissenting). Here, the government's deliberate oversight compels the reversal of Ayewoh's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p>I do not come to this conclusion lightly.

Op.</i> at 917, Ayewoh did not have any reason to \"object to admission of the certificate or to the record custodian's testimony\" or to \"cross examine the witness.\" An objection to evidence that was clearly foundational and properly framed would have been unnecessary if not inappropriate. And Ayewoh had no duty to cross-examine the record-keeper, especially when the exercise could only have assisted the prosecution. Instead, counsel properly adhered to cross-examination expert Irving Younger's well-regarded advice by leaving insufficient testimony alonenot asking one question too many and holding the prosecution to its burden of proof.</p>\n<p>[12]  While no analogy is perfect, the following might serve to illuminate this point. Imagine that a prosecutor, pointing to a defendant, asked a witness, \"Without saying anything substantive about him, do you recognize that man?\" If the witness responded, \"Yes I do, that is John Doe,\" it would be unreasonable for a jury (or a court) to interpret that statement as \"Yes I do, that is [murderer] John Doe.\" Adding a single word can make a world of difference.</p>\n<p>[13]  Both Ayewoh and the district court alerted the government to the infirmity of the evidence it adduced to prove the insurance element. When Ayewoh filed his motion for acquittal, he pointed out the numerous exhortations from the courts of appeals not to treat cavalierly the necessity of providing such proof. At that point, had the government simply moved to reopen the case and provided any one of a myriad of other pieces of evidence to substantiate its claim, Ayewoh's conviction would be unassailable. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mojica-Baez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770724\"><a href=\"/opinion/770724/united-states-v-john-alexis-mojica-baez-united-states-of-america-v-josue/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 299-300 (1st Cir.2000) (approving that practice). For example, the government could have asked the record-keeper whether she had searched for any documents that superseded or rescinded the certificate. <i>See </i><i>Neal,</i> 36 F.3d at 1207 n. 22. It could have called BPPR's manager to ask whether the company was insured. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

It could even have introduced into evidence \"the cancelled check for the [insurance premium for the] period of time covering\" the offense. <i>Maner,</i> 611 F.2d at 112 n. 2.
