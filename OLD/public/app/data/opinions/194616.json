On October 12, 1989,\n          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.\n                                      \n\nUniversal  Transportation  Services,  Inc.,  entered  into  a\n\ncontract  with Paul Arpin Van Lines, Inc.  Arpin is primarily\n\nin the  business of  moving and  storing household  goods and\n\nfurniture.    Universal  is  in the  business  of  soliciting\n\ncustomers and accounts for moving and storage companies.  The\n\ncontract  had a  term of  three years,  with a  provision for\n\nyear-to-year  extensions   after  the  three-year   term  had\n\nexpired.  On November 8, 1990,  Arpin notified Universal that\n\nit  was terminating the contract.  After Universal refused to\n\naccede  to   pre-term cancellation,  Arpin, on  May 3,  1991,\n\nfiled a declaratory judgment action in the district court  of\n\nRhode Island, seeking a  judgment that:  (a) the  contract is\n\n\"canceled,  rescinded or . . . null and void for illegality\";\n\n(b)   that   the   contract   is   \"illegal,   unlawful   and\n\nunenforceable.\"\n\n          Universal duly answered, denying that there was any\n\nlegal basis for  terminating the contract.    Universal  also\n\nbrought a counterclaim  on its  own behalf and  on behalf  of\n\nMcGowan  Associates,  Inc.    The  counterclaim  states  that\n\nMichael J. McGowan is the principal shareholder and president\n\nof Universal  and McGowan Associates, Inc.   The counterclaim\n\nalleged three counts:  Count I sought damages of $300,000 for\n\nArpin's  attempt   to  cancel  the  contract   prior  to  its\n\n                             -2-\n\ntermination date; Count II alleged  violations of restrictive\n\ncovenants in  the contract  and claimed damages  of $300,000;\n\nCount III  alleged interference  by Arpin with  a contractual\n\nrelationship  between  another  moving  company,  Richard  J.\n\nCoriell  &amp;   Co.,  Inc.,  and  both   Universal  and  McGowan\n\nAssociates, Inc.; damages of $300,000 were claimed.\n\n          The  case  was   tried,  jury-waived,  before   the\n\nDistrict  Court of Rhode  Island.   The district  court found\n\nthat  McGowan and  the business  entities he  controlled were\n\n\"brokers\" and as  such were  required to be  licensed by  the\n\nInterstate  Commerce  Commission  pursuant  to  49  U.S.C.   \n\n10921.1   It is  undisputed that neither  McGowan, Universal,\n\nnor McGowan Associates were  licensed by the ICC.   The court\n\ntherefore  held that the contract was illegal.  It found that\n\nUniversal  was  not entitled  to  commissions  it might  have\n\nearned over the remaining two-year term of the contract.  The\n\ncourt, however,  held that Universal was  entitled to collect\n\nthe commissions  it had earned  during the time  the contract\n\nwas  in  effect.   It found  that  Universal was  entitled to\n\n\"$3,231.05  of   restitution   for  unreported   and   unpaid\n\ncommissions and  $7,891.27 of  restitution for  reported, but\n\nunpaid,\n      commissions.\"\n                  Thedistrictcourt\n                                 alsodismissed\n                                             thecounterclaim.\n\n                    \n\n1 49 U.S.C.   10921 provides in pertinent  part that a person\nmay be a broker for motor carriers, \"only if the person holds\nthe appropriate  certificate, permit or  license issued under\nthis chapter authorizing the transportation or service.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Appellants,   Universal  and   McGowan  Associates,\n\ndispute  the  district court's  holding  that  they were  not\n\nentitled to the  commissions they would have  earned over the\n\nunexpired term of the  contract.  They have not  appealed the\n\ndistrict court's computation of  the commissions due them for\n\nbusiness  generated  during  the  time the  contract  was  in\n\neffect.  The appellee,  Arpin, has not appealed the  award of\n\ncommissions.  The root issue on appeal, therefore, is whether\n\nappellants can  recover,  as damages,  the  commissions  they\n\nwould  have earned if the contract had remained in effect for\n\nits three-year term.  We hold they cannot.\n\n              The Enforceability of the Contract\n                                                \n\n          Appellants  argue first  that  the contract  should\n\nhave  been enforced  regardless  of whether  McGowan2 was  an\n\nunlicensed  broker.  We note first that the contract here was\n\nnot intrinsically  illegal; it was not  a criminal conspiracy\n\nor one  whose purpose directly violated the  prohibition of a\n\nstatute.     The   question  is   whether  the   contract  is\n\nunenforceable because McGowan did not have a broker's license\n\nfrom the ICC, as required by 49 U.S.C.   10921.   The general\n\nrule  is that an otherwise valid contract that results in the\n\nviolation  of a  public-protection statute  or  regulation is\n\nunenforceable.  Resolution Trust  Corp. v. Home Sav.  of Am.,\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n2   We  follow  the  lead   of  the  parties   and  refer  to\ndefendants appellants as McGowan. \n\n                             -4-\n\n946 F.2d 93, 96  (8th Cir. 1991); Securities  Industry Ass'n.\n                                                             \n\nv.

The Seventh\n\nCircuit  has pointed  out  that \"the  defense of  illegality,\n\nbeing in character  if not origins an equitable  and remedial\n\ndoctrine, is not automatic but requires . . . a comparison of\n\nthe  pros and  cons of enforcement.\"   Northern  Indiana Pub.\n                                                             \n\nServ.

In that case  the court held  the contract  was\n\nenforceable, id.; it also noted that the statute violated was\n                \n\n\"an  anachronism a regulatory  statute on  which the  sun set\n\nlong ago.\"    Id. at  274.   In  Resolution  Trust the  court\n                                                  \n\nobserved:  \n\n          Some  federal  courts  have applied  this\n          less-than-absolute rule  and have refused\n          to enforce illegal  contracts only if the\n          statute or regulation explicitly provides\n          that  contracts in violation are void, or\n          if  the  interest in  enforcement clearly\n          outweighs   the  public   policy  against\n          enforcement.  \n\n946  F.2d at  96-97 (footnote  and  citations omitted).   The\n\ncourt held that  the case before it was not  one in which the\n\n                             -5-\n\ninterest  in  contract  enforcement  clearly  outweighed  the\n\npublic  policy  against  enforcement  and  held the  contract\n\n\"illegal and therefore unenforceable.\"  Id.\n                                           \n\n          McGowan  relies  on  two  Supreme  Court  cases  in\n\narguing for enforcement  of the contract.   In Bruce's Juices\n                                                             \n\nv. American Can Co., 330 U.S. 743 (1947), the Court held that\n                   \n\nit was no defense to a suit for collection of  notes that the\n\nseller had engaged in price discriminations against the buyer\n\nviolating  the  Robinson-Patman  Act.    The  Act  prescribed\n\ncriminal  penalties and  entitled  injured persons  to treble\n\ndamages, but did not specifically render the sales, for which\n\nthe  notes   were  given,  illegal  or   the  purchase  price\n\nuncollectible.   During the course of its  opinion, the Court\n\nstated:\n\n          But when the  contract sued  upon is  not\n          intrinsically  illegal,   the  Court  has\n          refused  to allow property to be obtained\n          under   a   contract   of  sale   without\n          enforcing the duty to pay for it  because\n          of  violations of  the  Sherman  Act  not\n          inhering  in  the particular  contract in\n          suit  and  has  reaffirmed the  \"doctrine\n          that  'where  a  statute  creates  a  new\n          offense  and  denounces  the penalty,  or\n          gives  a  new  right  and   declares  the\n          remedy,  the punishment or the remedy can\n          be   only   that   which    the   statute\n          prescribes.'\"   D.R.  Wilder Mfg.  Co. v.\n                                                \n          Corn Products Refining Co., 236 U.S. 165,\n                                     \n          174-175;  Connolly  v.  Union Sewer  Pipe\n                                                   \n          Co., 184 U.S. 540.\n             \n\nId. at  755.  In  Kelly v. Kosuga,  358 U.S. 516  (1959), the\n                                 \n\nCourt upheld the right of a  seller to recover from the buyer\n\n                             -6-\n\nthe unpaid balance due on a lawful sale even  though the sale\n\nwas made pursuant to an  agreement which violated   1  of the\n\nSherman Act.  The Court noted:\n\n            As  a  defense to  an  action based  on\n          contract, the plea of illegality based on\n          violation of  the Sherman Act has not met\n          with much  favor in  this Court.   Id. at\n                                                \n          518 (footnote omitted).\n\n          We  think  that  the precedential  value  of  these\n\nholdings  has been  limited by  two subsequent  Supreme Court\n\ncases.   In United States v. Mississippi Valley Co., 364 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n520  (1961),  the  Court  held  that   the  activities  of  a\n\nconsultant  retained  by the  government  violated a  statute\n\nprohibiting one  retained by the government  from engaging in\n\nactivities constituting a conflict of interest.  It held that\n\nthis  alone  precluded  the  respondent  from  enforcing  his\n\nconsulting  contract with the government.   Id. at  525.  The\n                                               \n\nCourt noted  that  the conflict-of-interest  statute did  not\n\n\"specifically provide for the invalidation of contracts which\n\nare  made  in   violation  of  the   statutory  prohibition.\"\n\nNevertheless,  the Court  held that  the  consulting contract\n\ncould not be enforced.  It stated:\n\n          Were we to decree the enforcement of such\n          a  contract,  we  would be  affirmatively\n          sanctioning the type of  infected bargain\n          which the statute outlaws and we would be\n          depriving  the  public of  the protection\n          which Congress has conferred.  \n\nId. at  563.  In Kaiser  Steel Corp. v. Mullins,  455 U.S. 72\n                                               \n\n(1982), the issue was\n\n                             -7-\n\n          whether a coal producer, when  it is sued\n          on  its promise  to  contribute to  union\n          welfare  funds based on  its purchases of\n          coal  from  producers not  under contract\n          with the union, is entitled to plead  and\n          have  adjudicated  a  defense   that  the\n          promise  is  illegal under  the antitrust\n          and labor laws.\n\nId.  at 74.    The  Court held  that  the  coal producer  was\n   \n\nentitled to so plead.  At the start of its analysis the Court\n\nstated: \n\n            There is no  statutory code of  federal\n          contract  law,  but  our cases  leave  no\n          doubt  that illegal promises  will not be\n          enforced  in  cases  controlled   by  the\n          federal law.\n\nId. at 77.   The Court discussed  Kelly v. Kosuga, supra,  at\n                                                        \n\nlength and  found that Kosuga \"contemplated  that the defense\n                             \n\nof illegality would be  entertained in a case such  as this.\"\n\nId. at 82.  \n   \n\n          We hold  that  under the  facts  of this  case  the\n\ncontract  between the  parties  was unenforceable  as to  the\n\nremaining two-year term, during  which time McGowan performed\n\nno  services for Arpin.   As the district  court pointed out,\n\nthe ICC broker requirement was enacted to protect  the public\n\nfrom   fraud  and/or   incompetent  motor   carrier  brokers.\n\nAlthough  there  is no  indication  that  McGowan was  either\n\nfraudulent or  incompetent, his failure to  obtain a broker's\n\nlicense cannot be ignored or forgiven.  There is no point  in\n\nspeculating why McGowan did not obtain a license.  The record\n\nevinces  that he had worked in the field of transportation of\n\n                             -8-\n\nhousehold goods for many years.  It can, therefore, be fairly\n\ninferred  that McGowan  knew  of the  ICC broker's  licensing\n\nrequirement.   There was also  record evidence from  which it\n\ncould  be found that McGowan, in answer to a direct question,\n\nstated he had  an ICC broker's license.   This was  a knowing\n\nmisrepresentation, even  though it  was not made  directly to\n\nArpin.  Viewing  the facts  in light of  the applicable  case\n\nlaw,  we find  that  it would  subvert the  public-protection\n\npolicy  of  the  statute to  enforce  the  unexpired  and not\n\nperformed term of the contract.\n\n                       Broker or Agent\n                                      \n\n          The district court held  that McGowan was a broker,\n\nnot a household goods agent,  and as such had to  be licensed\n\nby the  ICC.  Appellants argue that this was error.  We agree\n\nwith the  district court.  The starting  point is 49 U.S.C.  \n\n10921 which provides:\n\n          Requirement  for certificate,  permit, or\n          license\n          Except as provided  in this subchapter or\n          another   law,   a  person   may  provide\n          transportation or service subject  to the\n          jurisdiction  of the  Interstate Commerce\n          Commission under subchapter  II, III,  or\n          IV  of chapter 105 of  this title or be a\n          broker for transportation subject  to the\n          jurisdiction  of   the  Commission  under\n          subchapter  II of  that chapter,  only if\n          the   person    holds   the   appropriate\n          certificate,  permit,  or license  issued\n          under  this  subchapter  authorizing  the\n          transportation or service.\n\nA broker is defined as a person,\n\n                             -9-\n\n          other than a motor carrier or employee or\n                                                   \n          agent  of a  motor  carrier,  that  as  a\n                                     \n          principal  or  agent  sells,  offers  for\n          sale, negotiates for, or holds itself out\n          by   solicitation,    advertisement,   or\n          otherwise   as   selling,  providing   or\n          arranging  for,  transportation by  motor\n          carrier for compensation.\n\n49  U.S.C.    10102(1)  (emphasis  added).   The  distinction\n\nbetween  agent and broker,  inherent in the  statute, is made\n\nexplicit in the regulations:\n\n          Broker   means   a   person    who,   for\n          compensation,  arranges,   or  offers  to\n          arrange,  the transportation  of property\n          by  an authorized  motor carrier.   Motor\n          carriers, or persons who are employees or\n          bona fide  agents  of carriers,  are  not\n          brokers  within  the   meaning  of   this\n          section    when    they    arrange    the\n          transportation  of  shipments which  they\n          are  authorized  to  transport and  which\n          they  have  accepted  and  legally  bound\n          themselves to transport.\n\n          Bona fide agents are persons who are part\n          of the  normal  organization of  a  motor\n          carrier  and  perform  duties  under  the\n          carrier's   directions   pursuant  to   a\n          preexisting agreement  which provides for\n          a continuing relationship, precluding the\n          exercise of discretion on the part of the\n          agent in allocating  traffic between  the\n          carrier and others.\n\n49 C.F.R.   1045.2 (a) and (b) (1991).\n\n          The  evidence establishes  beyond  much doubt  that\n\nMcGowan was a  broker and not an agent.   The first paragraph\n\nof the contract states:\n\n          1.  SERVICES PROVIDED\n\n          A.   The Sales  Corporation shall be\n                                              \n               a non-exclusive sales agent for\n                                              \n\n                             -10-\n\n               the company during the  term of\n                          \n               this  agreement.   Both parties\n               understand  and agree  that the\n                                              \n               Sales    Corporation    is   an\n                                              \n               independent   contractor  which\n                                       \n               provides  for  the Company  the\n               sales  service  of  generating,\n               soliciting,   and   maintaining\n               customers   and  accounts   and\n               consulting  with  the  officers\n               and employees of the Company to\n               expand  the moving  traffic and\n               storage   business   for    the\n               Company.  (Emphasis added.)\n\n          Although the  language carefully eschews the use of\n\nthe word \"broker,\"  a \"non-exclusive sales agent\"  who is \"an\n\nindependent contractor\"  can only be  a broker as  defined in\n\nthe  regulations.    McGowan  was  not  part  of  the  normal\n\norganization of Arpin, nor was he an employee.  His role  was\n\nto  arrange  for  \"the   transportation  of  property  by  an\n\nauthorized motor  carrier\"  Arpin.   Viewing the  language of\n\nthe  contract in the  light of the  regulatory definitions of\n\nbroker and agents, McGowan was a broker.\n\n          The trial  record also confirms the  district court\n\nfinding that McGowan acted as  a broker.  In addition  to its\n\ncontract with  Arpin, McGowan had contracts  with three other\n\nmoving companies:  Richard Coriell &amp; Company, its subsidiary,\n\nCentral Moving  Systems, Inc., and Pan-American.   During his\n\ntestimony, McGowan reaffirmed the following statement made at\n\nhis deposition.\n\n          I said I don't  care what concessions you\n          get  remember one  thing  these  are  the\n          accounts.    These  accounts are  covered\n\n                             -11-\n\n          under contract of McGowan Associates.  If\n          I  don't like  Paul Arpin's  service then\n          those  accounts aren't going  to be going\n          on their trucks.\n\nThe  district  court  was  clearly  correct  in  ruling  that\n\nMcGowan was  a broker under  the ICC statute  and regulations\n\nand, as such, was required to be licensed by the ICC.3\n\n                          Miscellany\n                                    \n\n          McGowan  argues  that the  district court  erred by\n\nbasing its decision on testimony not in evidence and refusing\n\nto admit the entire deposition transcript of Michael McGowan.\n\nMcGowan quotes the following  statement in the district court\n\nopinion for his claim that the opinion was based on testimony\n\nnot in evidence:\n\n          McGowan    exercised     discretion    in\n          allocating  business  between  the  three\n          haulers that he represented.  Although at\n          trial McGowan adamantly denied having any\n          such  control  or influence,  McGowan had\n          previously boasted that if he didn't like\n          the  service  that  Arpin was  providing,\n          that  he wouldn't send accounts to Arpin.\n          He also had  bragged that moves  would be\n          booked  through Arpin only  if he allowed\n          them to be.\n\n                    \n\n3  McGowan has devoted over 18  pages of his brief to arguing\nthat in  1980 Congress  exempted household goods  agents from\nregulation by the ICC and that McGowan did not need a license\nbecause he was a household goods agent.  McGowan may be right\nabout what Congress did in 1980, but since we have found that\nMcGowan  was  a  broker,  not  an   agent,  the  argument  is\npointless.\n  We also reject without discussion McGowan's contention that\nArpin should be estopped from avoiding the contract.\n\n                             -12-\n\nIt is  true that the  last sentence from  the excerpt  has no\n\nevidentiary  foundation.  This,  however, was harmless error.\n\nAs already  discussed, there was  sufficient evidence without\n\nthe \"bragging\" referenceto establish thatMcGowan was abroker.\n\n          We do  not think that  the district court  erred in\n\nrefusing to admit McGowan's  entire deposition into evidence.\n\nThe record shows the following colloquy between the attorneys\n\nand  the  court prior  to and  following  its exclusion.   In\n\nreading the excerpt,  it is  important to keep  in mind  that\n\nGalli  represented  Arpin  and  that  McGowan's  attorney was\n\nGorham.\n\n            MR.  GALLI:   Your  Honor, rather  than\n          going through a lot more questions I have\n          sections of Mr. McGowan's  deposition I'd\n          like to offer into evidence under Rule 32\n          as an exhibit.\n            THE COURT:  Are they marked?\n            MR. GALLI:  They are marked, your Honor.  \n          What I've done is  I've taken each of the\n          pages    and   I    haven't   obliterated\n          everything, I've  just put a  yellow mark\n          down the  lines that I  would offer  into\n          evidence on each page.   There's a yellow\n          mark  on the left showing that lines that\n          I'd ask to offer into evidence.\n            THE COURT:  Are there any objections?\n            MR. N. GORHAM:  I'd just like to know\n          what the deposition transcripts are being\n          offered for?\n            THE COURT:  As evidence.\n            MR. N. GORHAM:  I have no objection. \n          I  don't  see the  relevancy of  it, your\n          Honor.\n            THE COURT:  The relevance of what?  It's\n          evidence.  It's treated  just the same as\n          the witness's  oral testimony.   How many\n          pages have I got to read?\n            MR. GALLI:  Your Honor, there are 20,\n\n                             -13-\n\n          25 pages but some of them have only three\n          or four lines.\n            THE COURT:  Hand it up.\n            (DEPOSITION  TRANSCRIPT  HANDED  UP  TO\n          COURT)\n            MR.  N. GORHAM:   Your  Honor, might  I\n          make  a suggestion.  The whole deposition\n          should be put in evidence.\n            THE COURT:  I am  not going to read the\n          whole  deposition.   You're not  going to\n          take  my time up with that.  I have a lot\n          of other  things to do  tonight which  is\n          the only time I get to read these things.\n            MR.  B. GORHAM:   Your Honor,  could we\n          have a minute to review this?\n            THE COURT:  You  should have seen  this\n          before.  Did you  give this to them ahead\n          of time?\n            MR.  GALLI:    I  just  did  this  this\n          morning, your Honor.\n            THE COURT:  You  don't even give them a\n          chance to look at it.\n            MR. GALLI:  Well, I'm  sorry.  I did it\n          this morning.\n            THE COURT:   I kind of  get the feeling\n          that it's my fault.\n            MR. GALLI:  I'm sorry, your Honor.\n            THE  COURT:   You can go  without lunch\n          and read it then, okay.  Let's go.   What\n          else do you have?\n\n          In  the court's  final remarks,  he told  Gorham to\n\nread  the  marked  portions  of  the  deposition  during  the\n\nluncheon recess.   Implicit in  this admonition was  that the\n\ncourt would consider admitting any parts that Attorney Gorham\n\nthought  contradicted  the  parts  marked  by  his   opponent\n\nAttorney Galli.  The record is barren of any future reference\n\nto McGowan's  deposition.  Neither the  entire deposition nor\n\nany  portion of it was subsequently offered in evidence.  Nor\n\nwas it marked for identification.\n\n          Fed. Rule Civ. Procedure 32(a)(4) provides:\n\n                             -14-\n\n            If only part of a deposition is offered\n          in evidence  by a party, an adverse party\n          may require the offeror to  introduce any\n          other part which ought  in fairness to be\n          considered with the part  introduced, and\n          any party may introduce any other parts.\n\n                             -15-\n\n          Fed. Rule of Evid. 106 is to the same effect:\n\n          Rule 106.  Remainder of or Related\n                Writings or Recorded Statements\n            When a writing or recorded statement or\n          part thereof is introduced by a party, an\n          adverse    party    may    require    the\n          introduction  at that  time of  any other\n          part  or  any other  writing  or recorded\n          statement which  ought in fairness  to be\n          considered contemporaneously with it.\n\n          Attorney  Galli offered  marked parts  of McGowan's\n\ndeposition in evidence.  The court was ready to receive them.\n\nAt  that  point Attorney  Gorham  suggested  that \"the  whole\n\ndeposition  be put  in  evidence.\"   The court  rejected this\n\nsuggestion;  the judge  then suggested  that Gorham  read the\n\nparts of  the  deposition that  had  been marked  during  the\n\nluncheon recess.   Neither  attorney did anything  further in\n\nregard to the deposition.\n\n          We  do not  think that  a  district court  judge is\n\nobligated to  go through the  entire deposition of  a witness\n\nwho  had testified  at the  trial to  determine if  there are\n\nconflicts in  the deposition  testimony or if  the deposition\n\ncontradicts the  courtroom testimony  of the witness.   Under\n\nour adversary system,  that is the  work of the lawyers.   It\n\nwas not done here and the judge should not be blamed.\n\n                             -16-\n\n          Finally,  McGowan  argues that  the court  erred in\n\ndismissing  his counterclaim for  interference by  Arpin with\n\nhis 1987 contract with Richard Coriell &amp; Company.4\n\n          We  affirm for  the reasons  given by  the district\n\ncourt in ruling from the bench:\n\n            The evidence in the  case is that there\n\n          was an agreement entered into on December\n          23rd  of  1987  by  and  between  McGowan\n          Associates    Incorporated,   hereinafter\n          referred  to as the  sales corporation, a\n          duly  organized  New  Jersey  corporation\n          with  a place of  business located  at 20\n          Stonehouse Road,  Millington, New Jersey,\n          and    Richard   Coriell    and   Company\n          Incorporated, a duly organized New Jersey\n          corporation, with a place of  business at\n          the same address.  The contention is made\n          in  connection   with  the  counterclaim,\n          among other things, that the Plaintiff in\n          this action  intentionally and unlawfully\n          interfered     with     a     contractual\n          relationship   existing    between   UTS,\n          McGowan  and  Coriell.   The  evidence is\n          that  the  agreement,  as  indicated,  at\n          least insofar as  McGowan's interest  are\n          concerned, was between McGowan Associates\n          Incorporated and Coriell.   Since McGowan\n          Associates  Incorporated does  not appear\n          to be a party to this action it seems  to\n          me that  under no circumstances  could it\n          recover, under no circumstances could Mr.\n          McGowan  recover, that the only party who\n          could recover for interference  with this\n          contract are the parties to the contract,\n          and the party to the contract is  McGowan\n          Associates  Incorporated  which is  not a\n          party to this litigation.  \n\n                    \n\n4 The dismissal of  the other two counts of  the counterclaim\nhave not been appealed.\n\n                             -17-\n\n          We have examined  the counterclaim  carefully.   It\n\nspecifically    names    as    counter-claimants    Universal\n\nTransportation  Services, Inc.  and Michael  J. McGowan.   It\n\ndoes state that Michael McGowan is doing business as  McGowan\n\nAssociates,  Inc.   Individuals, however,  do not  usually do\n\nbusiness  in  the name  of an  incorporated  entity.   As the\n\ndistrict court pointed out,  the contract which was allegedly\n\ninterfered with by Arpin was between McGowan Associates, Inc.\n\nand  Coriell;  it  was  not  between  McGowan  d/b/a  McGowan\n\nAssociates  and  Coriell.   There  can  be  no question  that\n\nMcGowan Associates, Inc. is not a party to this litigation.  \n\n          McGowan argues, in effect, that we should disregard\n\nthe separate corporate entity and treat him as the real party\n\nin  interest.   We do  not think  that we  should pierce  the\n\ncorporate veil at the behest of the individual  who fashioned\n\nit  so as  to  further the  individual's personal  interests.\n\nThat would make a nullity of the purpose and use of corporate\n\nstructures.  Nor can  we ignore pleadings drawn by  those who\n\nknew or should  have known of  the specific corporate  entity\n\nthat  executed the  contract  in  issue.    To  do  so  would\n\nconstitute a  judicial amendment  to the pleadings  after the\n\ntrial was over.\n\n          The judgement of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                          \n\n          Costs on appeal awarded to Arpin.  \n          Costs on appeal awarded to Arpin.\n                                           \n\n                             -18-\n",

On October 12, 1989,\n          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.\n                                      \n\nUniversal  Transportation  Services,  Inc.,  entered  into  a\n\ncontract  with Paul Arpin Van Lines, Inc.  Arpin is primarily\n\nin the  business of  moving and  storing household  goods and\n\nfurniture.    Universal  is  in the  business  of  soliciting\n\ncustomers and accounts for moving and storage companies.  The\n\ncontract  had a  term of  three years,  with a  provision for\n\nyear-to-year  extensions   after  the  three-year   term  had\n\nexpired.  On November 8, 1990,  Arpin notified Universal that\n\nit  was terminating the contract.  After Universal refused to\n\naccede  to   pre-term cancellation,  Arpin, on  May 3,  1991,\n\nfiled a declaratory judgment action in the district court  of\n\nRhode Island, seeking a  judgment that:  (a) the  contract is\n\n\"canceled,  rescinded or . . . null and void for illegality\";\n\n(b)   that   the   contract   is   \"illegal,   unlawful   and\n\nunenforceable.\"\n\n          Universal duly answered, denying that there was any\n\nlegal basis for  terminating the contract.    Universal  also\n\nbrought a counterclaim  on its  own behalf and  on behalf  of\n\nMcGowan  Associates,  Inc.    The  counterclaim  states  that\n\nMichael J. McGowan is the principal shareholder and president\n\nof Universal  and McGowan Associates, Inc.   The counterclaim\n\nalleged three counts:  Count I sought damages of $300,000 for\n\nArpin's  attempt   to  cancel  the  contract   prior  to  its\n\n                             -2-\n\ntermination date; Count II alleged  violations of restrictive\n\ncovenants in  the contract  and claimed damages  of $300,000;\n\nCount III  alleged interference  by Arpin with  a contractual\n\nrelationship  between  another  moving  company,  Richard  J.\n\nCoriell  &amp;   Co.,  Inc.,  and  both   Universal  and  McGowan\n\nAssociates, Inc.; damages of $300,000 were claimed.\n\n          The  case  was   tried,  jury-waived,  before   the\n\nDistrict  Court of Rhode  Island.   The district  court found\n\nthat  McGowan and  the business  entities he  controlled were\n\n\"brokers\" and as  such were  required to be  licensed by  the\n\nInterstate  Commerce  Commission  pursuant  to  49  U.S.C.   \n\n10921.1   It is  undisputed that neither  McGowan, Universal,\n\nnor McGowan Associates were  licensed by the ICC.   The court\n\ntherefore  held that the contract was illegal.  It found that\n\nUniversal  was  not entitled  to  commissions  it might  have\n\nearned over the remaining two-year term of the contract.  The\n\ncourt, however,  held that Universal was  entitled to collect\n\nthe commissions  it had earned  during the time  the contract\n\nwas  in  effect.   It found  that  Universal was  entitled to\n\n\"$3,231.05  of   restitution   for  unreported   and   unpaid\n\ncommissions and  $7,891.27 of  restitution for  reported, but\n\nunpaid,\n      commissions.\"\n                  Thedistrictcourt\n                                 alsodismissed\n                                             thecounterclaim.\n\n                    \n\n1 49 U.S.C.   10921 provides in pertinent  part that a person\nmay be a broker for motor carriers, \"only if the person holds\nthe appropriate  certificate, permit or  license issued under\nthis chapter authorizing the transportation or service.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Appellants,   Universal  and   McGowan  Associates,\n\ndispute  the  district court's  holding  that  they were  not\n\nentitled to the  commissions they would have  earned over the\n\nunexpired term of the  contract.  They have not  appealed the\n\ndistrict court's computation of  the commissions due them for\n\nbusiness  generated  during  the  time the  contract  was  in\n\neffect.  The appellee,  Arpin, has not appealed the  award of\n\ncommissions.  The root issue on appeal, therefore, is whether\n\nappellants can  recover,  as damages,  the  commissions  they\n\nwould  have earned if the contract had remained in effect for\n\nits three-year term.  We hold they cannot.\n\n              The Enforceability of the Contract\n                                                \n\n          Appellants  argue first  that  the contract  should\n\nhave  been enforced  regardless  of whether  McGowan2 was  an\n\nunlicensed  broker.  We note first that the contract here was\n\nnot intrinsically  illegal; it was not  a criminal conspiracy\n\nor one  whose purpose directly violated the  prohibition of a\n\nstatute.     The   question  is   whether  the   contract  is\n\nunenforceable because McGowan did not have a broker's license\n\nfrom the ICC, as required by 49 U.S.C.   10921.   The general\n\nrule  is that an otherwise valid contract that results in the\n\nviolation  of a  public-protection statute  or  regulation is\n\nunenforceable.  Resolution Trust  Corp. v.

The  Court held  that  the  coal producer  was\n   \n\nentitled to so plead.  At the start of its analysis the Court\n\nstated: \n\n            There is no  statutory code of  federal\n          contract  law,  but  our cases  leave  no\n          doubt  that illegal promises  will not be\n          enforced  in  cases  controlled   by  the\n          federal law.\n\nId. at 77.   The Court discussed  Kelly v.

As the district  court pointed out,\n\nthe ICC broker requirement was enacted to protect  the public\n\nfrom   fraud  and/or   incompetent  motor   carrier  brokers.\n\nAlthough  there  is no  indication  that  McGowan was  either\n\nfraudulent or  incompetent, his failure to  obtain a broker's\n\nlicense cannot be ignored or forgiven.  There is no point  in\n\nspeculating why McGowan did not obtain a license.  The record\n\nevinces  that he had worked in the field of transportation of\n\n                             -8-\n\nhousehold goods for many years.  It can, therefore, be fairly\n\ninferred  that McGowan  knew  of the  ICC broker's  licensing\n\nrequirement.   There was also  record evidence from  which it\n\ncould  be found that McGowan, in answer to a direct question,\n\nstated he had  an ICC broker's license.   This was  a knowing\n\nmisrepresentation, even  though it  was not made  directly to\n\nArpin.  Viewing  the facts  in light of  the applicable  case\n\nlaw,  we find  that  it would  subvert the  public-protection\n\npolicy  of  the  statute to  enforce  the  unexpired  and not\n\nperformed term of the contract.\n\n                       Broker or Agent\n                                      \n\n          The district court held  that McGowan was a broker,\n\nnot a household goods agent,  and as such had to  be licensed\n\nby the  ICC.  Appellants argue that this was error.  We agree\n\nwith the  district court.  The starting  point is 49 U.S.C.  \n\n10921 which provides:\n\n          Requirement  for certificate,  permit, or\n          license\n          Except as provided  in this subchapter or\n          another   law,   a  person   may  provide\n          transportation or service subject  to the\n          jurisdiction  of the  Interstate Commerce\n          Commission under subchapter  II, III,  or\n          IV  of chapter 105 of  this title or be a\n          broker for transportation subject  to the\n          jurisdiction  of   the  Commission  under\n          subchapter  II of  that chapter,  only if\n          the   person    holds   the   appropriate\n          certificate,  permit,  or license  issued\n          under  this  subchapter  authorizing  the\n          transportation or service.\n\nA broker is defined as a person,\n\n                             -9-\n\n          other than a motor carrier or employee or\n                                                   \n          agent  of a  motor  carrier,  that  as  a\n                                     \n          principal  or  agent  sells,  offers  for\n          sale, negotiates for, or holds itself out\n          by   solicitation,    advertisement,   or\n          otherwise   as   selling,  providing   or\n          arranging  for,  transportation by  motor\n          carrier for compensation.\n\n49  U.S.C.    10102(1)  (emphasis  added).   The  distinction\n\nbetween  agent and broker,  inherent in the  statute, is made\n\nexplicit in the regulations:\n\n          Broker   means   a   person    who,   for\n          compensation,  arranges,   or  offers  to\n          arrange,  the transportation  of property\n          by  an authorized  motor carrier.   Motor\n          carriers, or persons who are employees or\n          bona fide  agents  of carriers,  are  not\n          brokers  within  the   meaning  of   this\n          section    when    they    arrange    the\n          transportation  of  shipments which  they\n          are  authorized  to  transport and  which\n          they  have  accepted  and  legally  bound\n          themselves to transport.\n\n          Bona fide agents are persons who are part\n          of the  normal  organization of  a  motor\n          carrier  and  perform  duties  under  the\n          carrier's   directions   pursuant  to   a\n          preexisting agreement  which provides for\n          a continuing relationship, precluding the\n          exercise of discretion on the part of the\n          agent in allocating  traffic between  the\n          carrier and others.\n\n49 C.F.R.   1045.2 (a) and (b) (1991).\n\n          The  evidence establishes  beyond  much doubt  that\n\nMcGowan was a  broker and not an agent.   The first paragraph\n\nof the contract states:\n\n          1.  SERVICES PROVIDED\n\n          A.   The Sales  Corporation shall be\n                                              \n               a non-exclusive sales agent for\n                                              \n\n                             -10-\n\n               the company during the  term of\n                          \n               this  agreement.   Both parties\n               understand  and agree  that the\n                                              \n               Sales    Corporation    is   an\n                                              \n               independent   contractor  which\n                                       \n               provides  for  the Company  the\n               sales  service  of  generating,\n               soliciting,   and   maintaining\n               customers   and  accounts   and\n               consulting  with  the  officers\n               and employees of the Company to\n               expand  the moving  traffic and\n               storage   business   for    the\n               Company.  (Emphasis added.)\n\n          Although the  language carefully eschews the use of\n\nthe word \"broker,\"  a \"non-exclusive sales agent\"  who is \"an\n\nindependent contractor\"  can only be  a broker as  defined in\n\nthe  regulations.    McGowan  was  not  part  of  the  normal\n\norganization of Arpin, nor was he an employee.  His role  was\n\nto  arrange  for  \"the   transportation  of  property  by  an\n\nauthorized motor  carrier\"  Arpin.   Viewing the  language of\n\nthe  contract in the  light of the  regulatory definitions of\n\nbroker and agents, McGowan was a broker.\n\n          The trial  record also confirms the  district court\n\nfinding that McGowan acted as  a broker.  In addition  to its\n\ncontract with  Arpin, McGowan had contracts  with three other\n\nmoving companies:  Richard Coriell &amp; Company, its subsidiary,\n\nCentral Moving  Systems, Inc., and Pan-American.   During his\n\ntestimony, McGowan reaffirmed the following statement made at\n\nhis deposition.\n\n          I said I don't  care what concessions you\n          get  remember one  thing  these  are  the\n          accounts.    These  accounts are  covered\n\n                             -11-\n\n          under contract of McGowan Associates.  If\n          I  don't like  Paul Arpin's  service then\n          those  accounts aren't going  to be going\n          on their trucks.\n\nThe  district  court  was  clearly  correct  in  ruling  that\n\nMcGowan was  a broker under  the ICC statute  and regulations\n\nand, as such, was required to be licensed by the ICC.3\n\n                          Miscellany\n                                    \n\n          McGowan  argues  that the  district court  erred by\n\nbasing its decision on testimony not in evidence and refusing\n\nto admit the entire deposition transcript of Michael McGowan.\n\nMcGowan quotes the following  statement in the district court\n\nopinion for his claim that the opinion was based on testimony\n\nnot in evidence:\n\n          McGowan    exercised     discretion    in\n          allocating  business  between  the  three\n          haulers that he represented.  Although at\n          trial McGowan adamantly denied having any\n          such  control  or influence,  McGowan had\n          previously boasted that if he didn't like\n          the  service  that  Arpin was  providing,\n          that  he wouldn't send accounts to Arpin.\n          He also had  bragged that moves  would be\n          booked  through Arpin only  if he allowed\n          them to be.\n\n                    \n\n3  McGowan has devoted over 18  pages of his brief to arguing\nthat in  1980 Congress  exempted household goods  agents from\nregulation by the ICC and that McGowan did not need a license\nbecause he was a household goods agent.  McGowan may be right\nabout what Congress did in 1980, but since we have found that\nMcGowan  was  a  broker,  not  an   agent,  the  argument  is\npointless.\n  We also reject without discussion McGowan's contention that\nArpin should be estopped from avoiding the contract.\n\n                             -12-\n\nIt is  true that the  last sentence from  the excerpt  has no\n\nevidentiary  foundation.  This,  however, was harmless error.\n\nAs already  discussed, there was  sufficient evidence without\n\nthe \"bragging\" referenceto establish thatMcGowan was abroker.\n\n          We do  not think that  the district court  erred in\n\nrefusing to admit McGowan's  entire deposition into evidence.\n\nThe record shows the following colloquy between the attorneys\n\nand  the  court prior  to and  following  its exclusion.   In\n\nreading the excerpt,  it is  important to keep  in mind  that\n\nGalli  represented  Arpin  and  that  McGowan's  attorney was\n\nGorham.\n\n            MR.  GALLI:   Your  Honor, rather  than\n          going through a lot more questions I have\n          sections of Mr. McGowan's  deposition I'd\n          like to offer into evidence under Rule 32\n          as an exhibit.\n            THE COURT:  Are they marked?\n            MR. GALLI:  They are marked, your Honor.  \n          What I've done is  I've taken each of the\n          pages    and   I    haven't   obliterated\n          everything, I've  just put a  yellow mark\n          down the  lines that I  would offer  into\n          evidence on each page.   There's a yellow\n          mark  on the left showing that lines that\n          I'd ask to offer into evidence.\n            THE COURT:  Are there any objections?\n            MR. N. GORHAM:  I'd just like to know\n          what the deposition transcripts are being\n          offered for?\n            THE COURT:  As evidence.\n            MR. N. GORHAM:  I have no objection. \n          I  don't  see the  relevancy of  it, your\n          Honor.\n            THE COURT:  The relevance of what?  It's\n          evidence.  It's treated  just the same as\n          the witness's  oral testimony.   How many\n          pages have I got to read?\n            MR. GALLI:  Your Honor, there are 20,\n\n                             -13-\n\n          25 pages but some of them have only three\n          or four lines.\n            THE COURT:  Hand it up.\n            (DEPOSITION  TRANSCRIPT  HANDED  UP  TO\n          COURT)\n            MR.  N. GORHAM:   Your  Honor, might  I\n          make  a suggestion.  The whole deposition\n          should be put in evidence.\n            THE COURT:  I am  not going to read the\n          whole  deposition.   You're not  going to\n          take  my time up with that.  I have a lot\n          of other  things to do  tonight which  is\n          the only time I get to read these things.\n            MR.  B. GORHAM:   Your Honor,  could we\n          have a minute to review this?\n            THE COURT:  You  should have seen  this\n          before.  Did you  give this to them ahead\n          of time?\n            MR.  GALLI:    I  just  did  this  this\n          morning, your Honor.\n            THE COURT:  You  don't even give them a\n          chance to look at it.\n            MR. GALLI:  Well, I'm  sorry.  I did it\n          this morning.\n            THE COURT:   I kind of  get the feeling\n          that it's my fault.\n            MR. GALLI:  I'm sorry, your Honor.\n            THE  COURT:   You can go  without lunch\n          and read it then, okay.  Let's go.   What\n          else do you have?\n\n          In  the court's  final remarks,  he told  Gorham to\n\nread  the  marked  portions  of  the  deposition  during  the\n\nluncheon recess.   Implicit in  this admonition was  that the\n\ncourt would consider admitting any parts that Attorney Gorham\n\nthought  contradicted  the  parts  marked  by  his   opponent\n\nAttorney Galli.  The record is barren of any future reference\n\nto McGowan's  deposition.  Neither the  entire deposition nor\n\nany  portion of it was subsequently offered in evidence.  Nor\n\nwas it marked for identification.\n\n          Fed. Rule Civ. Procedure 32(a)(4) provides:\n\n                             -14-\n\n            If only part of a deposition is offered\n          in evidence  by a party, an adverse party\n          may require the offeror to  introduce any\n          other part which ought  in fairness to be\n          considered with the part  introduced, and\n          any party may introduce any other parts.\n\n                             -15-\n\n          Fed. Rule of Evid. 106 is to the same effect:\n\n          Rule 106.  Remainder of or Related\n                Writings or Recorded Statements\n            When a writing or recorded statement or\n          part thereof is introduced by a party, an\n          adverse    party    may    require    the\n          introduction  at that  time of  any other\n          part  or  any other  writing  or recorded\n          statement which  ought in fairness  to be\n          considered contemporaneously with it.\n\n          Attorney  Galli offered  marked parts  of McGowan's\n\ndeposition in evidence.  The court was ready to receive them.\n\nAt  that  point Attorney  Gorham  suggested  that \"the  whole\n\ndeposition  be put  in  evidence.\"   The court  rejected this\n\nsuggestion;  the judge  then suggested  that Gorham  read the\n\nparts of  the  deposition that  had  been marked  during  the\n\nluncheon recess.   Neither  attorney did anything  further in\n\nregard to the deposition.\n\n          We  do not  think that  a  district court  judge is\n\nobligated to  go through the  entire deposition of  a witness\n\nwho  had testified  at the  trial to  determine if  there are\n\nconflicts in  the deposition  testimony or if  the deposition\n\ncontradicts the  courtroom testimony  of the witness.   Under\n\nour adversary system,  that is the  work of the lawyers.   It\n\nwas not done here and the judge should not be blamed.\n\n                             -16-\n\n          Finally,  McGowan  argues that  the court  erred in\n\ndismissing  his counterclaim for  interference by  Arpin with\n\nhis 1987 contract with Richard Coriell &amp; Company.4\n\n          We  affirm for  the reasons  given by  the district\n\ncourt in ruling from the bench:\n\n            The evidence in the  case is that there\n\n          was an agreement entered into on December\n          23rd  of  1987  by  and  between  McGowan\n          Associates    Incorporated,   hereinafter\n          referred  to as the  sales corporation, a\n          duly  organized  New  Jersey  corporation\n          with  a place of  business located  at 20\n          Stonehouse Road,  Millington, New Jersey,\n          and    Richard   Coriell    and   Company\n          Incorporated, a duly organized New Jersey\n          corporation, with a place of  business at\n          the same address.  The contention is made\n          in  connection   with  the  counterclaim,\n          among other things, that the Plaintiff in\n          this action  intentionally and unlawfully\n          interfered     with     a     contractual\n          relationship   existing    between   UTS,\n          McGowan  and  Coriell.   The  evidence is\n          that  the  agreement,  as  indicated,  at\n          least insofar as  McGowan's interest  are\n          concerned, was between McGowan Associates\n          Incorporated and Coriell.   Since McGowan\n          Associates  Incorporated does  not appear\n          to be a party to this action it seems  to\n          me that  under no circumstances  could it\n          recover, under no circumstances could Mr.\n          McGowan  recover, that the only party who\n          could recover for interference  with this\n          contract are the parties to the contract,\n          and the party to the contract is  McGowan\n          Associates  Incorporated  which is  not a\n          party to this litigation.  \n\n                    \n\n4 The dismissal of  the other two counts of  the counterclaim\nhave not been appealed.\n\n                             -17-\n\n          We have examined  the counterclaim  carefully.   It\n\nspecifically    names    as    counter-claimants    Universal\n\nTransportation  Services, Inc.  and Michael  J. McGowan.   It\n\ndoes state that Michael McGowan is doing business as  McGowan\n\nAssociates,  Inc.   Individuals, however,  do not  usually do\n\nbusiness  in  the name  of an  incorporated  entity.   As the\n\ndistrict court pointed out,  the contract which was allegedly\n\ninterfered with by Arpin was between McGowan Associates, Inc.\n\nand  Coriell;  it  was  not  between  McGowan  d/b/a  McGowan\n\nAssociates  and  Coriell.   There  can  be  no question  that\n\nMcGowan Associates, Inc. is not a party to this litigation.  \n\n          McGowan argues, in effect, that we should disregard\n\nthe separate corporate entity and treat him as the real party\n\nin  interest.   We do  not think  that we  should pierce  the\n\ncorporate veil at the behest of the individual  who fashioned\n\nit  so as  to  further the  individual's personal  interests.\n\nThat would make a nullity of the purpose and use of corporate\n\nstructures.  Nor can  we ignore pleadings drawn by  those who\n\nknew or should  have known of  the specific corporate  entity\n\nthat  executed the  contract  in  issue.    To  do  so  would\n\nconstitute a  judicial amendment  to the pleadings  after the\n\ntrial was over.\n\n          The judgement of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                          \n\n          Costs on appeal awarded to Arpin.  \n          Costs on appeal awarded to Arpin.\n                                           \n\n                             -18-\n</pre>",
