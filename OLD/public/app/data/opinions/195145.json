After reviewing the record, we affirm.\n\n                          I.  Background\n                                        \n\n     In  March 1992,  the United  States  initiated a  forfeiture\n\naction  against defendant property, One Urban Lot located at Road\n\n143 K.  36.1 Bauta  Abajo Ward, Orocovis,  Puerto Rico,  under 21\n\nU.S.C.    881(a)(6),  (a)(7) and 18 U.S.C.    981(a)(1)(A).1  The\n\ngovernment alleged that  this property had been  used by claimant\n\nTorres  Colon as  a  meeting  place to  discuss  an illegal  drug\n\ndistribution scheme and that he bought it with proceeds traceable\n\nto  his  drug  transactions  for the  purpose  of  laundering the\n\nmoney.2    Torres  Colon  subsequently  was  prosecuted  for  his\n\nalleged involvement in the drug distribution  scheme.  On January\n\n20, 1993, a jury acquitted him of all criminal charges.\n\n     Nine  days  later, a  bench  trial  was  held in  the  civil\n\nforfeiture action against the defendant property.  In this  case,\n\n                    \n\n     121  U.S.C.      881(a)(6)  and  (a)(7)   are  part  of  the\nComprehensive  Drug Abuse Control and Prevention Act, and provide\nfor  forfeiture  to  the government  of  property  connected with\nillegal drug transactions.   18 U.S.C.   981(a)(1)(A)  is part of\nthe  Money  Laundering   Control  Act,  and  also   provides  for\nforfeiture   of   property    traceable   to   money   laundering\ntransactions.\n\n     2Torres  Colon was  alleged to  have  participated in  three\nseparate  schemes with  one or  two partners  whereby one  of the\npartners  would order  controlled  substances through  legitimate\ndrug wholesalers in  Miami, Florida,  sometimes using  fraudulent\nregistration  certificates  from  the  federal  Drug  Enforcement\nAdministration, and Torres Colon would  resell these drugs in New\nJersey and Pennsylvania.  \n\n                               -2-\n\nthe district court found that between 1989 and 1991, Torres Colon\n\nwas  involved in  three illegal  drug  distribution schemes  that\n\nbrought in more  than one million dollars in  proceeds.  Although\n\nhe  reported no  income  between  1986 and  1988,  and less  than\n\n$24,000 total income for  1989 and 1990, he managed to  support a\n\nfamily with three small children,  and, in 1990, to buy defendant\n\nproperty for more than $25,000.  The court also found that during\n\nthis  period, Torres  Colon made  many bank  deposits of  several\n\nthousand dollars,  and that the  planning meeting for one  of the\n\ndrug  distribution  schemes  took place  at  defendant  property.\n\nBased on these  findings, the court ordered that  the property be\n\nforfeited to the government.\n\n     Torres  Colon contests this  judgment on three  grounds.  He\n\nargues   that  defendant   property  was  misidentified   in  the\n\ncomplaint,  thus  invalidating  the court's  judgment.    He also\n\nclaims that  the district  court erred in  refusing to  shift the\n\nburden of proof back to the government after his acquittal in the\n\nrelated  criminal  case.   Finally,  he  challenges  the district\n\ncourt's factual  findings  as unsupported,  particularly  to  the\n\nextent that they rely on government witnesses whose testimony, he\n\nclaims, was not credible.  We consider these arguments in turn.\n\n               II.  Identification of the Property\n                                                  \n\n     Torres Colon  has pointed out  for the first time  on appeal\n\nthat   the  government's   complaint  in   this  case   contained\n\ndescriptions of  two  different  pieces  of  property.    In  the\n\ncaption, the defendant  property is identified as  \"One Urban Lot\n\n                               -3-\n\nLocated at  Road 143 K.  36.1 Bauta Abajo Ward,  Orocovis, Puerto\n\nRico.\"  The description of  the property in subpart (A), however,\n\nrefers to an entirely different  property, in a different city in\n\nPuerto Rico.   Torres Colon argues that this  discrepancy made it\n\nimpossible  for  him  to  know  which  property  was  subject  to\n\nforfeiture, and thus invalidates the forfeiture action.\n\n     We first note that appellant waived this argument by failing\n\nto raise it  in the court below.   Poliquin v. Garden  Way, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n989 F.2d 527, 531  (1st Cir. 1993).  He may not  raise it for the\n\nfirst  time before  this court,  absent  a showing  that a  grave\n\nmiscarriage of  justice would result.   Id.; Johnston  v. Holiday\n                                                                 \n\nInns, Inc., 595  F.2d 890,  894 (1st  Cir. 1979).   He falls  far\n          \n\nshort of meeting this standard.  \n\n     Indeed,  even were  this claim  properly  before us,  Torres\n\nColon's contention  that the  government failed  to identify  the\n\nforfeited  property  with  sufficient particularity  would  fail.\n\nAdmiralty  Rule  C(2)  of  the  Supplemental  Rules  for  Certain\n\nAdmiralty  and  Maritime Claims,  applicable  to  both forfeiture\n\nstatutes, sets forth  the level of detail  required in describing\n\nthe  property subject  to forfeiture.3   21  U.S.C.    881(b); 18\n\nU.S.C.    981(b)(2);  United  States  v.  Approximately  2,538.85\n                                                                 \n\nShares of Stock, 988 F.2d 1281, 1283 (1st Cir. 1993).   This rule\n               \n\nprovides  that  a  complaint   \"shall  describe  with  reasonable\n\n                    \n\n     3The  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply to interstitial\nmatters or where Admiralty  Rules are silent.  In the  event of a\nconflict,  the Admiralty Rules  control.  384-390  West Broadway,\n                                                                \n964 F.2d at 1247 n.4.\n\n                               -4-\n\nparticularity the  property that is  the subject of  the action.\"\n\nThe complaint  should achieve a  \"meaningful level of  detail\" in\n\nits  description,  which is  sufficient  to put  the  claimant on\n\nnotice that his  property is at risk of forfeiture.  384-390 West\n                                                                 \n\nBroadway, 964 F.2d at 1248.\n        \n\n     Despite  the mismatch between the property identified in the\n\ncaption and the  description that appears in subpart  (A), we are\n\nconfident  that no significant confusion occurred.  The complaint\n\nconsistently refers to the defendant property as that located  at\n\nthe address in Orocovis, Puerto Rico, pointing to this particular\n\nproperty as that used to facilitate the commission  of particular\n\nviolations of the drug and money laundering laws, and bought with\n\nthe proceeds of  illegal drug trafficking activities.   Following\n\neach  complete description of the Orocovis address, the complaint\n\nrefers indirectly to the description in subpart (A) as \"Defendant\n\nA in caption.\"  Such  abbreviated reference does not override the\n\ngovernment's  clear focus  on the  Orocovis property.   It  seems\n\ninescapable  to us,  therefore, that Torres  Colon was  on notice\n\nthat this particular property was at risk of forfeiture.  \n\n     We  note, in  addition,  that  Torres  Colon's  own  actions\n\nsupport  this conclusion.   For  example,  in his  answer to  the\n\nforfeiture complaint, Torres Colon affirmed  that he had a  \"real\n\nand personal  property interest\" in  the property at Road  143 K.\n\n36.1 Bauta Abajo Ward,  Orocovis, Puerto Rico, and  had forfeited\n\nthe  contents  of the  residence  at  this  address.   Also,  the\n\n                               -5-\n\ngovernment successfully served  notice on both appellant  and the\n\ndefendant property at this address.  \n\n                               -6-\n\n                III.  Shift in the Burden of Proof\n                                                  \n\n     In forfeiture actions brought pursuant to 21 U.S.C.   881(a)\n\nand 18 U.S.C.    981, the  allocation of the parties'  burdens of\n\nproof is provided  by the customs laws.   See 21 U.S.C.    881(d)\n                                             \n\n(incorporating  procedures for customs  forfeitures); 18 U.S.C.  \n\n981(d) (same);  19 U.S.C.    1615  (codifying customs  forfeiture\n\nprocedures);  United States v. Parcels of Property Located at 255\n                                                                 \n\nBroadway, Hanover, No. 92-1776, slip op. at 2  (1st Cir. Nov. 24,\n                 \n\n1993).  Under these rules,  the government has the initial burden\n\nof demonstrating probable cause to  believe that the property was\n\nused for a specified illegal purpose.  Id. at  2-3; United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. A Certain Parcel of  Land, Moultonboro, 781 F. Supp.  830, 833\n                                         \n\n(D.N.H. 1992).   Once the  government has made this  showing, the\n\nburden shifts to the claimant to show, by a preponderance  of the\n\nevidence, \"that  the property  was not used  in violation  of the\n\nstatute or that it  was so used without the owners'  knowledge or\n\nconsent.\"    United States  v. Parcel of  Land &amp; Residence  at 28\n                                                                 \n\nEmery  Street,  914   F.2d  1,  3  (1st  Cir.   1990);  see  also\n                                                                 \n\nMoultonboro, 781 F. Supp. at 833.4      On December 28, 1992, the\n           \n\ndistrict court granted the government's pre-trial motion to shift\n\nthe  burden of  proof to  the  claimant to  defend his  property.\n\n                    \n\n     4The statutory  burden  shifting procedures  stack the  deck\nheavily in  favor of the government.   To show  probable cause to\nforfeit,  the  government  need  demonstrate  only  a \"reasonable\nground for belief of guilt[,]  supported by less than prima facie\nproof but more than mere  suspicion\" that the property is subject\nto forfeiture.   28 Emery Street,  914 F.2d at 3  (quoting United\n                                                                 \nStates v. $250,000  in United States Currency, 808  F.2d 895, 897\n                                             \n(1st Cir.  1987)).  The  claimant, by contrast, must  establish a\ndefense to forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence.  Id.\n                                                              \n\n                               -7-\n\nFollowing  his  later  acquittal in  the  related  criminal case,\n\nTorres Colon  asked the district  court to reshift the  burden of\n\nproof in the forfeiture trial back to the government.   He claims\n\nthat the court erred in refusing to do so.  While his argument is\n\nfacially appealing, it has no basis in law.\n\n     Torres Colon argues, in  essence, that his acquittal  in the\n\ncriminal case established a presumption that the property was not\n\nused to  facilitate a criminal  venture, and therefore,  that the\n\ndistrict court was  required to shift back to  the government the\n\nburden  of proving  that the  property was  used for  a specified\n\nillegal  purpose.  Section 881 and  981 forfeitures are, however,\n\ncivil  in nature,  and the burden  of proof differs  from that in\n\ncriminal trials.   An acquittal  in the criminal charge  at issue\n\nrepresents a determination that  the proof was not sufficient  to\n\novercome all reasonable doubt  against the accused, while  in the\n\ncivil case,  the government needs  only to meet the  much lighter\n\nprobable cause burden  prescribed by statute.   See United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. One Parcel  of Real Property Known  as Plat 20, Lot  17, Great\n                                                                 \n\nHarbor Neck, New  Shoreham, Rhode Island, 960 F.2d  200, 205 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1992) (noting government's \"relatively light burden\" to show\n\nprobable cause).   The  outcome of  related criminal  proceedings\n\nagainst Torres Colon therefore does not affect the probable cause\n\ndetermination,  or the burden  shifting, in the  civil forfeiture\n\ntrial.  See, e.g.,  United States v. Land and Bldg.  at 2 Burditt\n                                                                 \n\nStreet, 924 F.2d 383, 385-86 (1st Cir. 1991).\n      \n\n                               -8-\n\n            IV.  The District Court's Factual Findings\n                                                      \n\n     Torres Colon  also challenges  the district  court's factual\n\nfindings as unsupported  by credible evidence.  His primary claim\n\nis that the district court erred  in relying on the testimony  of\n\ngovernment  witnesses regarding his  participation in the alleged\n\ndrug diversion scheme, and the relationship of defendant property\n\nto  this  scheme.    Torres  Colon contends  that  much  of  this\n\ntestimony  was  not  believable, and  was  contradicted  by other\n\nwitnesses.\n\n     We review the district court's  findings of facts in a bench\n\ntrial  only for clear error. Fed.  R. Civ. P. 52(a); Dedham Water\n                                                                 \n\nCo. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                             \n\nUnder  this standard, we  must affirm the  district court unless,\n\nafter reviewing the  entire record, this court \"is  left with the\n\ndefinite and firm conviction that a  mistake has been committed.\"\n\nUnited  States v.  United States  Gypsum Co.,  333 U.S.  364, 395\n                                            \n\n(1948).     When   the  record   evidence  supports   conflicting\n\ninferences, the district court's choice from among them cannot be\n\nclearly   erroneous.    Cumberland   Farms,  972  F.2d   at  462.\n                                          \n\nFurthermore, when  factual findings are  based on  determinations\n\nregarding the credibility  of witnesses, Rule 52(a)  demands even\n\ngreater  deference to the  district court.   Rodriguez-Morales v.\n                                                              \n\nVeterans' Administration, 931 F.2d 980, 982 (1st Cir. 1991).  \n                        \n\n     Our  review  of  the  record  finds ample  support  for  the\n\ndistrict  court's factual  findings.    The  district  court  was\n\nentitled  to  believe  witness  testimony  that established  that\n\n                               -9-\n\nTorres Colon  participated in  illegal drug distribution  schemes\n\ninvolving  more  than  one  million  dollars  of  drugs; that  he\n\nreceived a substantial  portion of the proceeds from  the sale of\n\nthese drugs; and that he purchased defendant  property with cash.\n\nThe district court also was entitled to believe witness testimony\n\nthat  the  planning  meeting for  one  of  the drug  distribution\n\nschemes took  place at  defendant  property, notwithstanding  the\n\ncompeting testimony  of another  witness that  this meeting  took\n\nplace at a restaurant in another town.  \n\n     In addition, the evidence that Torres Colon bought defendant\n\nproperty  at a  time when  he  had three  dependent children  and\n\nlittle legitimate income, together with evidence that he received\n\nsubstantial  illegal drug  proceeds,  supports the  lower court's\n\nconclusion  that  it  was reasonable  to  believe  that defendant\n\nproperty was bought with profits from his drug transactions.  \n\n             V.  Torres Colon's Post-Argument Motion\n                                                    \n\n     Two weeks  after oral  argument in  this case,  Torres Colon\n\nfiled a pro se motion in which he  argued that he did not buy the\n\ndefendant property in February 1990, as the district court found,\n\nbut nine months later, on September 11, 1990.  He attached a copy\n\nof the deed as proof of this claim.  \n\n     At  trial, the  government  put  into  evidence  a  registry\n\ncertificate  which established a  February 7, 1990  purchase date\n\nfor  defendant property.    From  our review  of  the record,  it\n\nappears that that certificate applies to the property erroneously\n\ndescribed in subpart (A) of  the complaint.  It therefore appears\n\n                               -10-\n\nthat the  deed provided  by Torres  Colon with  his post-argument\n\nmotion  accurately   reflects  a  September  purchase   date  for\n\ndefendant property.\n\n     This discrepancy does not strengthen Torres Colon's position\n\non  appeal, however.   At  trial, both  parties proceeded  on the\n\nassumption  that   defendant  property,  and   not  the  property\n\ndescribed in  subpart  (A) of  the  complaint, was  the  property\n\nsubject to forfeiture.   Thus, neither the  incorrect description\n\nin subpart  (A), nor the  use of the wrong  registry certificate,\n\ncaused any significant confusion.   As noted above, in his answer\n\nto the forfeiture complaint, Torres  Colon affirmed that he had a\n\n\"real and personal property interest\" in the property at Road 143\n\nK.  36.1  Bauta  Abajo  Ward,  Orocovis,  Puerto  Rico,  and  had\n\nforfeited the contents of the residence at this address.  Nor did\n\nTorres Colon object at trial  that defendant property was not the\n\none purchased on February 7, 1990.  \n\n     In  addition,   the  evidence   at  trial   amply  supported\n\nforfeiture  of  defendant  property, regardless  of  when  it was\n\npurchased.   The  evidence  showed that  between  1989 and  1991,\n\nTorres Colon and his partners handled illegal drugs  whose street\n\nvalue was  more than one  million dollars, and that  Torres Colon\n\nreceived  a  disproportionately  large share  of  these proceeds.\n\nOther evidence revealed that Torres Colon's total reported income\n\nfor 1989  and 1990 was  less than  $24,000.  During  this period,\n\nwhile  also supporting a family with three small children, Torres\n\nColon bought  property for which  he paid more than  his reported\n\n                               -11-\n\nearnings.  This proof fully supports the district court's finding\n\nof  probable cause to believe that  defendant property was bought\n\nwith  the proceeds of Torres  Colon's illegal involvement in drug\n\ntrafficking.   Thus, even  though the  government introduced  the\n\nwrong registry  certificate at trial, no grave injustice was done\n\nin this case.   \n\n     The  decision of the  district court ordering  forfeiture to\n                                                                 \n\nthe government of defendant property is therefore affirmed.\n                                                           \n\n                               -12-\n",

After reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1992, the United States initiated a forfeiture action against defendant property, One Urban Lot located at Road 143 K. 36.1 Bauta Abajo Ward, Orocovis, Puerto Rico, under 21 U.S.C. Secs. 881(a)(6), (a)(7) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 981(a)(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The government alleged that this property had been used by claimant Torres Colon as a meeting place to discuss an illegal drug distribution scheme and that he bought it with proceeds traceable to his drug transactions for the purpose of laundering the money.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Torres Colon subsequently was prosecuted for his alleged involvement in the drug distribution scheme.  On January 20, 1993, a jury acquitted him of all criminal charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nine days later, a bench trial was held in the civil forfeiture action against the defendant property.  In this case, the district court found that between 1989 and 1991, Torres Colon was involved in three illegal drug distribution schemes that brought in more than one million dollars in proceeds.  Although he reported no income between 1986 and 1988, and less than $24,000 total income for 1989 and 1990, he managed to support a family with three small children, and, in 1990, to buy defendant property for more than $25,000.  The court also found that during this period, Torres Colon made many bank deposits of several thousand dollars, and that the planning meeting for one of the drug distribution schemes took place at defendant property.  Based on these findings, the court ordered that the property be forfeited to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres Colon contests this judgment on three grounds.  He argues that defendant property was misidentified in the complaint, thus invalidating the court's judgment.  He also claims that the district court erred in refusing to shift the burden of proof back to the government after his acquittal in the related criminal case.  Finally, he challenges the district court's factual findings as unsupported, particularly to the extent that they rely on government witnesses whose testimony, he claims, was not credible.  We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Identification of the Property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres Colon has pointed out for the first time on appeal that the government's complaint in this case contained descriptions of two different pieces of property.  In the caption, the defendant property is identified as \"One Urban Lot Located at Road 143 K. 36.1 Bauta Abajo Ward, Orocovis, Puerto Rico.\"  The description of the property in subpart (A), however, refers to an entirely different property, in a different city in Puerto Rico.  Torres Colon argues that this discrepancy made it impossible for him to know which property was subject to forfeiture, and thus invalidates the forfeiture action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first note that appellant waived this argument by failing to raise it in the court below.   Poliquin v. Garden Way, Inc., 989 F.2d 527, 531 (1st Cir. 1993).  He may not raise it for the first time before this court, absent a showing that a grave miscarriage of justice would result.  Id.; Johnston v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 595 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir. 1979).  He falls far short of meeting this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, even were this claim properly before us, Torres Colon's contention that the government failed to identify the forfeited property with sufficient particularity would fail.  Admiralty Rule C(2) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims, applicable to both forfeiture statutes, sets forth the level of detail required in describing the property subject to forfeiture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(b);  18 U.S.C. Sec. 981(b)(2);   United States v. Approximately 2,538.85 Shares of Stock, 988 F.2d 1281, 1283 (1st Cir. 1993).  This rule provides that a complaint \"shall describe with reasonable particularity the property that is the subject of the action.\"  The complaint should achieve a \"meaningful level of detail\" in its description, which is sufficient to put the claimant on notice that his property is at risk of forfeiture.  384-390 West Broadway, 964 F.2d at 1248.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the mismatch between the property identified in the caption and the description that appears in subpart (A), we are confident that no significant confusion occurred.  The complaint consistently refers to the defendant property as that located at the address in Orocovis, Puerto Rico, pointing to this particular property as that used to facilitate the commission of particular violations of the drug and money laundering laws, and bought with the proceeds of illegal drug trafficking activities.  Following each complete description of the Orocovis address, the complaint refers indirectly to the description in subpart (A) as \"Defendant A in caption.\"  Such abbreviated reference does not override the government's clear focus on the Orocovis property.  It seems inescapable to us, therefore, that Torres Colon was on notice that this particular property was at risk of forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, in addition, that Torres Colon's own actions support this conclusion.  For example, in his answer to the forfeiture complaint, Torres Colon affirmed that he had a \"real and personal property interest\" in the property at Road 143 K. 36.1 Bauta Abajo Ward, Orocovis, Puerto Rico, and had forfeited the contents of the residence at this address.  Also, the government successfully served notice on both appellant and the defendant property at this address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Shift in the Burden of Proof</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In forfeiture actions brought pursuant to 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(a) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 981, the allocation of the parties' burdens of proof is provided by the customs laws.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(d) (incorporating procedures for customs forfeitures);  18 U.S.C. Sec. 981(d) (same);  19 U.S.C. Sec. 1615 (codifying customs forfeiture procedures);  United States v. Parcels of Property Located at 255 Broadway, Hanover, No. 92-1776, slip op. at 2 (1st Cir.  Nov. 24, 1993).  Under these rules, the government has the initial burden of demonstrating probable cause to believe that the property was used for a specified illegal purpose.  Id. at 2-3;   United States v. A Certain Parcel of Land, Moultonboro, 781 F. Supp. 830, 833 (D.N.H. 1992).  Once the government has made this showing, the burden shifts to the claimant to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, \"that the property was not used in violation of the statute or that it was so used without the owners' knowledge or consent.\"   United States v. Parcel of Land &amp; Residence at 28 Emery Street, 914 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1990);   see also Moultonboro, 781 F. Supp. at 833.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 28, 1992, the district court granted the government's pre-trial motion to shift the burden of proof to the claimant to defend his property.  Following his later acquittal in the related criminal case, Torres Colon asked the district court to reshift the burden of proof in the forfeiture trial back to the government.  He claims that the court erred in refusing to do so.  While his argument is facially appealing, it has no basis in law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres Colon argues, in essence, that his acquittal in the criminal case established a presumption that the property was not used to facilitate a criminal venture, and therefore, that the district court was required to shift back to the government the burden of proving that the property was used for a specified illegal purpose.  Section 881 and 981 forfeitures are, however, civil in nature, and the burden of proof differs from that in criminal trials.  An acquittal in the criminal charge at issue represents a determination that the proof was not sufficient to overcome all reasonable doubt against the accused, while in the civil case, the government needs only to meet the much lighter probable cause burden prescribed by statute.   See United States v. One Parcel of Real Property Known as Plat 20, Lot 17, Great Harbor Neck, New Shoreham, Rhode Island, 960 F.2d 200, 205 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting government's \"relatively light burden\" to show probable cause).  The outcome of related criminal proceedings against Torres Colon therefore does not affect the probable cause determination, or the burden shifting, in the civil forfeiture trial.   See, e.g., United States v. Land and Bldg. at 2 Burditt Street, 924 F.2d 383, 385-86 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. The District Court's Factual Findings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres Colon also challenges the district court's factual findings as unsupported by credible evidence.  His primary claim is that the district court erred in relying on the testimony of government witnesses regarding his participation in the alleged drug diversion scheme, and the relationship of defendant property to this scheme.  Torres Colon contends that much of this testimony was not believable, and was contradicted by other witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's findings of facts in a bench trial only for clear error.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a);   Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992).  Under this standard, we must affirm the district court unless, after reviewing the entire record, this court \"is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"   United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948).  When the record evidence supports conflicting inferences, the district court's choice from among them cannot be clearly erroneous.   Cumberland Farms, 972 F.2d at 462.  Furthermore, when factual findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses, Rule 52(a) demands even greater deference to the district court.   Rodriguez-Morales v. Veterans' Administration, 931 F.2d 980, 982 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record finds ample support for the district court's factual findings.  The district court was entitled to believe witness testimony that established that Torres Colon participated in illegal drug distribution schemes involving more than one million dollars of drugs;  that he received a substantial portion of the proceeds from the sale of these drugs;  and that he purchased defendant property with cash.  The district court also was entitled to believe witness testimony that the planning meeting for one of the drug distribution schemes took place at defendant property, notwithstanding the competing testimony of another witness that this meeting took place at a restaurant in another town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the evidence that Torres Colon bought defendant property at a time when he had three dependent children and little legitimate income, together with evidence that he received substantial illegal drug proceeds, supports the lower court's conclusion that it was reasonable to believe that defendant property was bought with profits from his drug transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Torres Colon's Post-Argument Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks after oral argument in this case, Torres Colon filed a pro se motion in which he argued that he did not buy the defendant property in February 1990, as the district court found, but nine months later, on September 11, 1990.  He attached a copy of the deed as proof of this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government put into evidence a registry certificate which established a February 7, 1990 purchase date for defendant property.  From our review of the record, it appears that that certificate applies to the property erroneously described in subpart (A) of the complaint.  It therefore appears that the deed provided by Torres Colon with his post-argument motion accurately reflects a September purchase date for defendant property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This discrepancy does not strengthen Torres Colon's position on appeal, however.  At trial, both parties proceeded on the assumption that defendant property, and not the property described in subpart (A) of the complaint, was the property subject to forfeiture.  Thus, neither the incorrect description in subpart (A), nor the use of the wrong registry certificate, caused any significant confusion.  As noted above, in his answer to the forfeiture complaint, Torres Colon affirmed that he had a \"real and personal property interest\" in the property at Road 143 K. 36.1 Bauta Abajo Ward, Orocovis, Puerto Rico, and had forfeited the contents of the residence at this address.  Nor did Torres Colon object at trial that defendant property was not the one purchased on February 7, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the evidence at trial amply supported forfeiture of defendant property, regardless of when it was purchased.  The evidence showed that between 1989 and 1991, Torres Colon and his partners handled illegal drugs whose street value was more than one million dollars, and that Torres Colon received a disproportionately large share of these proceeds.  Other evidence revealed that Torres Colon's total reported income for 1989 and 1990 was less than $24,000.  During this period, while also supporting a family with three small children, Torres Colon bought property for which he paid more than his reported earnings.  This proof fully supports the district court's finding of probable cause to believe that defendant property was bought with the proceeds of Torres Colon's illegal involvement in drug trafficking.  Thus, even though the government introduced the wrong registry certificate at trial, no grave injustice was done in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court ordering forfeiture to the government of defendant property is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C.

Sec. 981(a)(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The government alleged that this property had been used by claimant Torres Colon as a meeting place to discuss an illegal drug distribution scheme and that he bought it with proceeds traceable to his drug transactions for the purpose of laundering the money.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Torres Colon subsequently was prosecuted for his alleged involvement in the drug distribution scheme.  On January 20, 1993, a jury acquitted him of all criminal charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nine days later, a bench trial was held in the civil forfeiture action against the defendant property.  In this case, the district court found that between 1989 and 1991, Torres Colon was involved in three illegal drug distribution schemes that brought in more than one million dollars in proceeds.  Although he reported no income between 1986 and 1988, and less than $24,000 total income for 1989 and 1990, he managed to support a family with three small children, and, in 1990, to buy defendant property for more than $25,000.  The court also found that during this period, Torres Colon made many bank deposits of several thousand dollars, and that the planning meeting for one of the drug distribution schemes took place at defendant property.  Based on these findings, the court ordered that the property be forfeited to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres Colon contests this judgment on three grounds.  He argues that defendant property was misidentified in the complaint, thus invalidating the court's judgment.  He also claims that the district court erred in refusing to shift the burden of proof back to the government after his acquittal in the related criminal case.  Finally, he challenges the district court's factual findings as unsupported, particularly to the extent that they rely on government witnesses whose testimony, he claims, was not credible.  We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Identification of the Property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres Colon has pointed out for the first time on appeal that the government's complaint in this case contained descriptions of two different pieces of property.  In the caption, the defendant property is identified as \"One Urban Lot Located at Road 143 K. 36.1 Bauta Abajo Ward, Orocovis, Puerto Rico.\"  The description of the property in subpart (A), however, refers to an entirely different property, in a different city in Puerto Rico.  Torres Colon argues that this discrepancy made it impossible for him to know which property was subject to forfeiture, and thus invalidates the forfeiture action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first note that appellant waived this argument by failing to raise it in the court below.   Poliquin v. Garden Way, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603502\"><a href=\"/opinion/603502/richard-and-anita-poliquin-v-garden-way-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 531 (1st Cir. 1993).  He may not raise it for the first time before this court, absent a showing that a grave miscarriage of justice would result.  Id.; Johnston v. Holiday Inns, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364881\"><a href=\"/opinion/364881/alfred-m-johnston-individually-alfred-m-johnston-trustee-and-daniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span>, 894 (1st Cir. 1979).  He falls far short of meeting this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, even were this claim properly before us, Torres Colon's contention that the government failed to identify the forfeited property with sufficient particularity would fail.  Admiralty Rule C(2) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims, applicable to both forfeiture statutes, sets forth the level of detail required in describing the property subject to forfeiture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(b);  18 U.S.C. Sec. 981(b)(2);   United States v. Approximately 2,538.85 Shares of Stock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602801\"><a href=\"/opinion/602801/united-states-v-approximately-two-thousand-five-hundred-thirty-eight/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1281</span></a></span>, 1283 (1st Cir. 1993).  This rule provides that a complaint \"shall describe with reasonable particularity the property that is the subject of the action.\"  The complaint should achieve a \"meaningful level of detail\" in its description, which is sufficient to put the claimant on notice that his property is at risk of forfeiture.  384-390 West Broadway, 964 F.2d at 1248.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the mismatch between the property identified in the caption and the description that appears in subpart (A), we are confident that no significant confusion occurred.  The complaint consistently refers to the defendant property as that located at the address in Orocovis, Puerto Rico, pointing to this particular property as that used to facilitate the commission of particular violations of the drug and money laundering laws, and bought with the proceeds of illegal drug trafficking activities.  Following each complete description of the Orocovis address, the complaint refers indirectly to the description in subpart (A) as \"Defendant A in caption.\"  Such abbreviated reference does not override the government's clear focus on the Orocovis property.  It seems inescapable to us, therefore, that Torres Colon was on notice that this particular property was at risk of forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, in addition, that Torres Colon's own actions support this conclusion.  For example, in his answer to the forfeiture complaint, Torres Colon affirmed that he had a \"real and personal property interest\" in the property at Road 143 K. 36.1 Bauta Abajo Ward, Orocovis, Puerto Rico, and had forfeited the contents of the residence at this address.  Also, the government successfully served notice on both appellant and the defendant property at this address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Shift in the Burden of Proof</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In forfeiture actions brought pursuant to 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(a) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 981, the allocation of the parties' burdens of proof is provided by the customs laws.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(d) (incorporating procedures for customs forfeitures);  18 U.S.C. Sec. 981(d) (same);  19 U.S.C. Sec. 1615 (codifying customs forfeiture procedures);  United States v. Parcels of Property Located at 255 Broadway, Hanover, No. 92-1776, slip op. at 2 (1st Cir.  Nov. 24, 1993).  Under these rules, the government has the initial burden of demonstrating probable cause to believe that the property was used for a specified illegal purpose.  Id. at 2-3;   United States v. A Certain Parcel of Land, Moultonboro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1411458\"><a href=\"/opinion/1411458/united-states-v-a-certain-parcel-of-land-moultonboro/\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span>, 833 (D.N.H. 1992).  Once the government has made this showing, the burden shifts to the claimant to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, \"that the property was not used in violation of the statute or that it was so used without the owners' knowledge or consent.\"   United States v. Parcel of Land &amp; Residence at 28 Emery Street, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547664\"><a href=\"/opinion/547664/united-states-v-parcel-of-land-and-residence-at-28-emery-street-merrimac/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 1990);   see also Moultonboro, 781 F. Supp. at 833.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 28, 1992, the district court granted the government's pre-trial motion to shift the burden of proof to the claimant to defend his property.  Following his later acquittal in the related criminal case, Torres Colon asked the district court to reshift the burden of proof in the forfeiture trial back to the government.  He claims that the court erred in refusing to do so.  While his argument is facially appealing, it has no basis in law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres Colon argues, in essence, that his acquittal in the criminal case established a presumption that the property was not used to facilitate a criminal venture, and therefore, that the district court was required to shift back to the government the burden of proving that the property was used for a specified illegal purpose.  Section 881 and 981 forfeitures are, however, civil in nature, and the burden of proof differs from that in criminal trials.  An acquittal in the criminal charge at issue represents a determination that the proof was not sufficient to overcome all reasonable doubt against the accused, while in the civil case, the government needs only to meet the much lighter probable cause burden prescribed by statute.   See United States v. One Parcel of Real Property Known as Plat 20, Lot 17, Great Harbor Neck, New Shoreham, Rhode Island, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580694\"><a href=\"/opinion/580694/nos-91-1681-91-1682/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting government's \"relatively light burden\" to show probable cause).  The outcome of related criminal proceedings against Torres Colon therefore does not affect the probable cause determination, or the burden shifting, in the civil forfeiture trial.   See, e.g., United States v. Land and Bldg. at 2 Burditt Street, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555050\"><a href=\"/opinion/555050/united-states-v-land-and-building-at-2-burditt-street-everett/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 385-86 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. The District Court's Factual Findings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres Colon also challenges the district court's factual findings as unsupported by credible evidence.  His primary claim is that the district court erred in relying on the testimony of government witnesses regarding his participation in the alleged drug diversion scheme, and the relationship of defendant property to this scheme.  Torres Colon contends that much of this testimony was not believable, and was contradicted by other witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's findings of facts in a bench trial only for clear error.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a);   Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588805\"><a href=\"/opinion/588805/dedham-water-co-inc-v-cumberland-farms-dairy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 457 (1st Cir. 1992).  Under this standard, we must affirm the district court unless, after reviewing the entire record, this court \"is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"   United States v. United States Gypsum Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104523\"><a href=\"/opinion/104523/united-states-v-united-states-gypsum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 395 (1948).  When the record evidence supports conflicting inferences, the district court's choice from among them cannot be clearly erroneous.   Cumberland Farms, 972 F.2d at 462.  Furthermore, when factual findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses, Rule 52(a) demands even greater deference to the district court.   Rodriguez-Morales v. Veterans' Administration, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560356\"><a href=\"/opinion/560356/55-fair-emplpraccas-1306-56-empl-prac-dec-p-40725-luz-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 982 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record finds ample support for the district court's factual findings.  The district court was entitled to believe witness testimony that established that Torres Colon participated in illegal drug distribution schemes involving more than one million dollars of drugs;  that he received a substantial portion of the proceeds from the sale of these drugs;  and that he purchased defendant property with cash.  The district court also was entitled to believe witness testimony that the planning meeting for one of the drug distribution schemes took place at defendant property, notwithstanding the competing testimony of another witness that this meeting took place at a restaurant in another town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the evidence that Torres Colon bought defendant property at a time when he had three dependent children and little legitimate income, together with evidence that he received substantial illegal drug proceeds, supports the lower court's conclusion that it was reasonable to believe that defendant property was bought with profits from his drug transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Torres Colon's Post-Argument Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks after oral argument in this case, Torres Colon filed a pro se motion in which he argued that he did not buy the defendant property in February 1990, as the district court found, but nine months later, on September 11, 1990.  He attached a copy of the deed as proof of this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government put into evidence a registry certificate which established a February 7, 1990 purchase date for defendant property.  From our review of the record, it appears that that certificate applies to the property erroneously described in subpart (A) of the complaint.  It therefore appears that the deed provided by Torres Colon with his post-argument motion accurately reflects a September purchase date for defendant property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This discrepancy does not strengthen Torres Colon's position on appeal, however.  At trial, both parties proceeded on the assumption that defendant property, and not the property described in subpart (A) of the complaint, was the property subject to forfeiture.  Thus, neither the incorrect description in subpart (A), nor the use of the wrong registry certificate, caused any significant confusion.  As noted above, in his answer to the forfeiture complaint, Torres Colon affirmed that he had a \"real and personal property interest\" in the property at Road 143 K. 36.1 Bauta Abajo Ward, Orocovis, Puerto Rico, and had forfeited the contents of the residence at this address.  Nor did Torres Colon object at trial that defendant property was not the one purchased on February 7, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the evidence at trial amply supported forfeiture of defendant property, regardless of when it was purchased.  The evidence showed that between 1989 and 1991, Torres Colon and his partners handled illegal drugs whose street value was more than one million dollars, and that Torres Colon received a disproportionately large share of these proceeds.  Other evidence revealed that Torres Colon's total reported income for 1989 and 1990 was less than $24,000.  During this period, while also supporting a family with three small children, Torres Colon bought property for which he paid more than his reported earnings.  This proof fully supports the district court's finding of probable cause to believe that defendant property was bought with the proceeds of Torres Colon's illegal involvement in drug trafficking.  Thus, even though the government introduced the wrong registry certificate at trial, no grave injustice was done in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court ordering forfeiture to the government of defendant property is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C. Secs. 881(a)(6) and (a)(7) are part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Control and Prevention Act, and provide for forfeiture to the government of property connected with illegal drug transactions.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 981(a)(1)(A) is part of the Money Laundering Control Act, and also provides for forfeiture of property traceable to money laundering transactions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Torres Colon was alleged to have participated in three separate schemes with one or two partners whereby one of the partners would order controlled substances through legitimate drug wholesalers in Miami, Florida, sometimes using fraudulent registration certificates from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, and Torres Colon would resell these drugs in New Jersey and Pennsylvania</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply to interstitial matters or where Admiralty Rules are silent.  In the event of a conflict, the Admiralty Rules control.  384-390 West Broadway, 964 F.2d at 1247 n. 4</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The statutory burden shifting procedures stack the deck heavily in favor of the government.  To show probable cause to forfeit, the government need demonstrate only a \"reasonable ground for belief of guilt[,] supported by less than prima facie proof but more than mere suspicion\" that the property is subject to forfeiture.   28 Emery Street, 914 F.2d at 3 ( quoting United States v. $250,000 in United States Currency, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481321\"><a href=\"/opinion/481321/united-states-v-250000-in-united-states-currency-two-cases-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span>, 897 (1st Cir. 1987)).
