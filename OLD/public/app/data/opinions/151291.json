Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n              Boudin, Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Nicolás Nogueras Cartagena, Julio C. Alejandro Serrano, and\nOffice of Nicolás Nogueras Cartagena on brief for appellants.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Appellate Chief, and Luke Cass, Assistant United States\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                           July 22, 2010\n\f              SELYA, Circuit Judge.     This appeal follows on the heels\n\nof the dismissal of a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) suit as time-\n\nbarred.       We reach the same conclusion as the district court,\n\nalthough we premise our decision on alternative holdings (one of\n\nwhich extends beyond the lower court’s rationale).\n\n              The facts are straightforward.         Upon returning from\n\nmilitary service in Vietnam, plaintiff-appellant Nelson Cortés-\n\nCastillo1      experienced    delusions       and   depression.          This\n\nsymptomatology led to a diagnosis of schizophrenia.           In August of\n\n1970, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) assigned Cortés-\n\nCastillo a 100% disability rating. This rating dictated the amount\n\nof disability benefits due to him.           See 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(a).\n\n              On July 16, 1975, the VA's regional office, responding to\n\na psychiatric reevaluation, lowered the plaintiff's disability\n\nrating to 70%.       The lowered rating resulted in a corresponding\n\ndecrease in disability benefits.\n\n              The VA notified the plaintiff of the reduction on July\n\n24,   1975,    effective   October    1,    1975.   The   plaintiff   sought\n\nadministrative review before the Board of Veterans Affairs (the\n\nBoard). In a decision dated November 2, 1976, the Board upheld the\n\n\n\n      1\n       There are actually three plaintiffs: Cortés-Castillo;             his\nwife, Francisca Román-Cancel; and their conjugal partnership.            For\nease in exposition, we refer to Cortés-Castillo as if he were            the\nsole plaintiff.     Because the other plaintiffs' claims                 are\nderivative,   the  resolution   of  Cortés-Castillo's   claim             is\ndeterminative of all the issues on appeal.\n\n                                      -2-\n\flowered   disability   rating   (and,    thus,   cemented   in   place   the\n\ncorresponding decrease in benefits).\n\n            The plaintiff subsequently sought to restore his 100%\n\ndisability rating.     On November 21, 1985, the Board denied his\n\npetition.    On April 30, 1986, the plaintiff served a notice of\n\ndisagreement in which he alleged that the VA had committed a clear\n\nand unmistakable error in reducing his disability rating.\n\n            For all practical purposes, the matter lay fallow until\n\nMay of 2001, when the plaintiff again charged, in a renewed filing\n\nwith the Board, that the lowered disability rating was the product\n\nof clear and unmistakable error.        This time, the Board upheld the\n\nplaintiff’s claim; on October 14, 2004, it returned his disability\n\nrating to 100%.   It also awarded him retroactive benefits totaling\n\n$33,905.11, dating back to 1975. The plaintiff received this award\n\nin a lump sum, paid on March 4, 2005.\n\n            This victory did not placate the plaintiff. Invoking the\n\nFTCA, he filed an administrative claim with the VA on August 16,\n\n2005, alleging negligent reduction of his disability benefits.            By\n\nlaw, the VA had six months within which to respond.              28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2675(a).    On December 22, 2005, the VA denied the claim.2             It\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       On October 7, 2005, the plaintiff filed a premature civil\naction in the district court.    The court dismissed this action\nwithout prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\nNeither the commencement nor the termination of this action is\nmaterial to the issues on appeal.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fexplained that the plaintiff's exclusive remedy was the award of\n\nretroactive benefits (already received).\n\n            The VA's response laid out the plaintiff's options for\n\nfurther review.     It informed him that he could either file for\n\nadministrative reconsideration or sue under the FTCA.              The letter\n\nspelled out the temporal limitations that applied to each of these\n\noptions.    The plaintiff did nothing within the time allotted (six\n\nmonths).\n\n            On   August    8,   2006,    the   plaintiff   filed    a   second\n\nadministrative claim with the VA, once again alleging negligent\n\nreduction of his benefits.       This second claim went unanswered.\n\n            On April 2 or 3, 2007 — the record is tenebrous, but the\n\nexact date makes no difference — the plaintiff sued the government\n\nin the United States District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico.   See 28 U.S.C. § 1346.     The plaintiff's complaint sounded the\n\nsame theme adumbrated in the two administrative claims, premising\n\nthe government’s liability on an allegedly negligent reduction of\n\nbenefits.   The government moved to dismiss, arguing that the court\n\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction because the suit had not been\n\nfiled within two years next following the accrual of the cause of\n\naction.    See id. § 2401(b); Skwira v. United States, 344 F.3d 64,\n\n71 (1st Cir. 2003).       The plaintiff opposed the motion.\n\n            The district court concluded that the plaintiff's cause\n\nof action had accrued in November of 1985 (when the Board denied\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fthe petition to restore the higher disability rating).                 Román-\n\nCancel v. United States, No. 07-1275, slip op. at 10 (D.P.R. July\n\n31, 2009) (unpublished).      This timely appeal followed.\n\n           We review the granting of a motion to dismiss for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction de novo.            See Fothergill v. United\n\nStates, 566 F.3d 248, 251 (1st Cir. 2009); González v. United\n\nStates, 284 F.3d 281, 287 (1st Cir. 2002).           We are not wedded to\n\nthe lower court's rationale, but may affirm the order of dismissal\n\non any ground made manifest by the record.                InterGen, N.V. v.\n\nGrina, 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           Generally speaking, the United States enjoys immunity\n\nfrom suit.   See McCloskey v. Mueller, 446 F.3d 262, 266 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); see also Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, 413 (1821).                 In\n\nthe FTCA, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671-2680, Congress waived the\n\ngovernment's   sovereign   immunity      with   respect    to   private   tort\n\nactions.     That   waiver,   however,     is   hedged    by    a   number   of\n\nrestrictions and conditions.      See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a)-(n);\n\nsee also Fothergill, 566 F.3d at 252. Congress further limited the\n\nwaiver by incorporating into the FTCA a series of fixed time\n\nlimits.    See Rakes v. United States, 442 F.3d 7, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    The limitations period prescribed in the FTCA constitutes\n\na condition of the immunity waiver, and its expiration extinguishes\n\nany potential governmental liability.           United States v. Kubrick,\n\n444 U.S. 111, 117-18 (1979).\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          The time limits for FTCA actions have more than one\n\ndimension.   A tort claim against the United States \"shall be\n\nforever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate\n\nfederal agency within two years after such claim accrues or unless\n\naction is begun within six months after the date of mailing . . .\n\nof notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it\n\nwas presented.\"    28 U.S.C. § 2401(b).   These temporal parameters\n\nare strictly construed in favor of the sovereign.     Patterson v.\n\nUnited States, 451 F.3d 268, 270 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          The case at hand deals with both of the FTCA's temporal\n\nlimitations. We begin with the six-month filing deadline following\n\nthe denial of an administrative claim.    The district court based\n\nits analysis on the two-year claim-filing deadline following the\n\naccrual of the claim.    It did not discuss the six-month filing\n\ndeadline, assuming that the second administrative claim, filed on\n\nAugust 8, 2006, was the operative filing.     The court's analysis\n\ntherefore proceeded on the assumption that the six-month window for\n\nthe commencement of suit opened on February 8, 2007 (the effective\n\ndenial date of the second administrative claim).     See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2675(a) (stating that the \"failure of an agency to make final\n\ndisposition of a claim within six months after it is filed shall\n\n. . . be deemed a final denial of the claim\").      Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court regarded the suit initiated in early April of 2007\n\nas timely filed.\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f                On appeal, the government argues that the plaintiff's\n\nfirst administrative claim was the operative filing for the purpose\n\nof measuring the six-month window.            Since the VA denied that claim\n\non December 22, 2005, the government posits, the window closed on\n\nJune 22, 2006. Thus, the plaintiff's suit, commenced in early April\n\nof 2007, overshot the deadline.\n\n                The plaintiff's riposte is twofold.      First, he says that\n\nthis argument is waived because the government did not advance it\n\nbelow.     Second, he maintains that the later administrative claim\n\ncomprises the correct point of reference.\n\n                The waiver argument is easily dismissed. Compliance with\n\nthe FTCA's temporal deadlines is both mandatory and jurisdictional.\n\nGonzález, 284 F.3d at 288; González-Bernal v. United States, 907\n\nF.2d 246, 248 (1st Cir.          1990).        It is a familiar rule that\n\nchallenges to a federal court's subject matter jurisdiction can be\n\nraised at any stage of the litigation.            See, e.g., ConnectU LLC v.\n\nZuckerberg, 522 F.3d 82, 86 n.2 (1st Cir. 2008); Am. Fiber &\n\nFinishing, Inc. v. Tyco Healthcare Group, LP, 362 F.3d 136, 138-39\n\n(1st     Cir.    2004).   That   rule    controls    here:   this   particular\n\njurisdictional question, although raised by the government for the\n\nfirst time on appeal, is properly before us.\n\n                The dilemma created by the duplicative administrative\n\nclaims is more apparent than real.            The papers in the case describe\n\nonly a single injury: the (allegedly negligent) reduction of the\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fplaintiff's disability benefits.          Even without the claim forms\n\n(which are not part of the record on appeal),3 the only inference\n\nthat can be drawn is that both claims relate to that injury.           See\n\n32 C.F.R. § 750.26(c) (\"A claim is a notice . . . of an incident\n\ngiving rise to Government liability . . . .\").                From a legal\n\nstandpoint, then, the second claim is the functional equivalent of\n\nthe first.\n\n             Where,   as   here,    a   party   has   filed    duplicative\n\nadministrative claims, an inquiring court can regard the second\n\nclaim in one of two ways: as either an attempt to re-file the\n\noriginal claim or an attempt to have the agency reconsider its\n\ndisposition of the original claim.        Either way, the second claim in\n\nthis case is a nullity.     We explain briefly.\n\n             If we view the second claim as an attempt to re-file, it\n\nwould not reconfigure the FTCA time line.          Nothing to change the\n\nsubstance of the claims occurred in the interval between the first\n\nand   second   filings.     Under   these    circumstances,    the   second\n\nadministrative claim served no legitimate purpose.\n\n             That conclusion divests the second claim of any legal\n\neffect.   After all, it would be pointless for a court to allow a\n\nclaimant an opportunity to reopen the FTCA's limitations window by\n\n\n\n      3\n       The plaintiff, as the party prosecuting the appeal, has the\nresponsibility to ensure that the record on appeal is complete.\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 11(a); Real v. Hogan, 828 F.2d 58, 60 (1st Cir.\n1987).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthe simple expedient of re-filing a claim to supplant an earlier,\n\nfunctionally equivalent claim on which the window had shut.                In the\n\nbargain, honoring a re-filed claim would frustrate the goal of the\n\nFTCA's     filing    deadlines.      See    Steven     W.     Feldman,    Federal\n\nAdministrative Practice § 445, at 167 (4th ed. 2002) (explaining\n\nthat decisions of the Board \"are final\").\n\n             The    point   is   obvious,   so   the   case    law   is   sparse.\n\nNevertheless, what few cases there are plausibly suggest that such\n\nrepetitive filings should not be given effect.              See, e.g., Matos v.\n\nSec'y of HEW, 581 F.2d 282, 286 (1st Cir. 1978) (holding denial of\n\nadministrative claim res judicata as to subsequent claim for the\n\nsame benefits on the same grounds).          That makes perfect sense: one\n\nbite at the apple is all that the FTCA's claim-filing scheme\n\nallows.4    Cf. Dynamic Image Techs., Inc. v. United States, 221 F.3d\n\n34, 39 (1st Cir. 2000) (reinforcing strict construction of FTCA\n\nrequirements).\n\n             Of course, there is another way in which one might view\n\nthe second administrative claim: as a request to reconsider the\n\ndenial of the original claim.        But even if assayed in that manner,\n\nthe second claim here would nonetheless be impuissant.\n\n             The FTCA sets out a six-month period following the denial\n\nof an administrative claim in which an FTCA action premised on that\n\n\n     4\n        This holding applies to claims that are essentially\nduplicative of one another. We take no view of the propriety of a\nsuccessive claim that is, in some meaningful sense, new.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fclaim may be brought. 28 U.S.C. § 2401(b). Prior to the expiration\n\nof that period, a claimant, as an alternative, also has six months\n\nto file a request with the agency for reconsideration of the\n\npreviously denied claim. 28 C.F.R. § 14.9(b). A timely request for\n\nreconsideration will toll the six-month period for filing suit for\n\nan additional six months (or such shorter period in which the agency\n\nactually responds to the request).      See Berti v. VA Hosp., 860 F.2d\n\n338, 340 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n           The time parameters for such requests for reconsideration\n\nare strictly enforced. See id. This means that an untimely request\n\ndoes not reopen an expired six-month window for the filing of suit.\n\nId.\n\n           The VA denied the first administrative claim by letter\n\ndated December 22, 2005.    The letter informed the appellant of his\n\noption to file a request for reconsideration within six months of\n\nthat date and provided helpful information for doing so. The letter\n\nalso made it clear that \"[t]o be timely filed, this request [for\n\nreconsideration] must be received by VA prior to the expiration of\n\n6 months from the date of the mailing of this final denial.\"\n\n           The plaintiff's second administrative claim was not filed\n\nuntil August 8, 2006 — beyond the six-month period allotted for\n\nreconsideration requests.    That was too late.    See Davis v. United\n\nStates, 589 F.3d 861, 865 (6th Cir. 2009) (finding administrative\n\nclaim exhausted if there is no timely request for reconsideration).\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f               The short of it is that, no matter how the second\n\nadministrative claim is characterized, it had no practical effect.\n\nConsequently, the first administrative claim is the relevant claim\n\nfor the purpose of determining the timeliness of the instant action.\n\n               There is no need to tarry.     The first administrative\n\nclaim was denied on December 22, 2005. The plaintiff had six months\n\nfrom that date within which to sue.5       See 28 U.S.C. § 2401(b).   The\n\nplaintiff commenced his suit on April 2 or 3, 2007.        This was one\n\nyear, three months, and ten or eleven days after the denial of the\n\nrelevant administrative claim.       Accordingly, this suit is untimely.\n\nSee Vélez-Díaz v. United States, 507 F.3d 717, 720 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n               The plaintiff's suit is untimely on a second ground as\n\nwell.       As the district court recognized, the plaintiff did not file\n\neither administrative claim with the VA within two years after his\n\ncause of action accrued.         This is a fatal flaw.    See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2401(b).\n\n               For FTCA purposes, a claim accrues upon the occurrence of\n\nthe underlying injury.        Callahan v. United States, 426 F.3d 444,\n\n450-51 (1st Cir. 2005).       This moment is pinpointed at the time the\n\ninjured party knows of the existence and the cause of his injury.\n\nId. at 451.       Something less than full knowledge suffices to start\n\nthe running of the FTCA limitations period. Skwira, 344 F.3d at 78.\n\n\n        5\n       The plaintiff does not argue that this six-month period was\nsomehow tolled.   Any such argument is, therefore, waived.     See\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 9 n.7 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fAccrual is triggered by the discovery of sufficient facts about the\n\ninjury and its cause to prompt a reasonable person to seek advice\n\nto decide if there is a basis for filing a claim.              Callahan, 426\n\nF.3d at 451; Skwira, 344 F.3d at 78.\n\n             The plaintiff contends that he had no knowledge of the\n\nexistence or cause of his injury until October of 2004, when the\n\nBoard agreed that the reduction of his disability rating was the\n\nresult of clear and unmistakable error.            Like the district court,\n\nwe find this argument unconvincing.            At bottom, it is an effort to\n\nredefine what constitutes accrual.          See, e.g., Callahan, 426 F.3d\n\nat 450-51.\n\n             The plaintiff knew all the pertinent facts about his\n\ninjury when he was first notified of the impending decrease in his\n\ndisability rating on July 24, 1975.            His repeated efforts to have\n\nhis rating increased highlight this knowledge.                 He also knew\n\ndefinitively of the causal connection between the VA's action and\n\nhis injury by November 21, 1985. It was on that date that the Board\n\ndenied his petition to restore his disability rating.               Thus, the\n\nplaintiff's claim, for FTCA purposes, accrued by November of 1985.\n\nHe had two years from that time in which to initiate the FTCA claim-\n\nfiling process.     He missed this deadline.\n\n             In   his   reply   brief,   the    plaintiff   makes   a   related\n\nassertion that it was the VA's acknowledgment of error and inept\n\nhandling over time, rather than the original incorrect decision to\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\freduce his disability rating, that triggered the running of the\n\ntwo-year limitations period.

This appeal follows on the heels\n\nof the dismissal of a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) suit as time-\n\nbarred.       We reach the same conclusion as the district court,\n\nalthough we premise our decision on alternative holdings (one of\n\nwhich extends beyond the lower court’s rationale).\n\n              The facts are straightforward.         Upon returning from\n\nmilitary service in Vietnam, plaintiff-appellant Nelson Cortés-\n\nCastillo1      experienced    delusions       and   depression.          This\n\nsymptomatology led to a diagnosis of schizophrenia.           In August of\n\n1970, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) assigned Cortés-\n\nCastillo a 100% disability rating. This rating dictated the amount\n\nof disability benefits due to him.           See 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(a).\n\n              On July 16, 1975, the VA's regional office, responding to\n\na psychiatric reevaluation, lowered the plaintiff's disability\n\nrating to 70%.       The lowered rating resulted in a corresponding\n\ndecrease in disability benefits.\n\n              The VA notified the plaintiff of the reduction on July\n\n24,   1975,    effective   October    1,    1975.   The   plaintiff   sought\n\nadministrative review before the Board of Veterans Affairs (the\n\nBoard). In a decision dated November 2, 1976, the Board upheld the\n\n\n\n      1\n       There are actually three plaintiffs: Cortés-Castillo;             his\nwife, Francisca Román-Cancel; and their conjugal partnership.            For\nease in exposition, we refer to Cortés-Castillo as if he were            the\nsole plaintiff.     Because the other plaintiffs' claims                 are\nderivative,   the  resolution   of  Cortés-Castillo's   claim             is\ndeterminative of all the issues on appeal.\n\n                                      -2-\n\flowered   disability   rating   (and,    thus,   cemented   in   place   the\n\ncorresponding decrease in benefits).\n\n            The plaintiff subsequently sought to restore his 100%\n\ndisability rating.     On November 21, 1985, the Board denied his\n\npetition.    On April 30, 1986, the plaintiff served a notice of\n\ndisagreement in which he alleged that the VA had committed a clear\n\nand unmistakable error in reducing his disability rating.\n\n            For all practical purposes, the matter lay fallow until\n\nMay of 2001, when the plaintiff again charged, in a renewed filing\n\nwith the Board, that the lowered disability rating was the product\n\nof clear and unmistakable error.        This time, the Board upheld the\n\nplaintiff’s claim; on October 14, 2004, it returned his disability\n\nrating to 100%.   It also awarded him retroactive benefits totaling\n\n$33,905.11, dating back to 1975. The plaintiff received this award\n\nin a lump sum, paid on March 4, 2005.\n\n            This victory did not placate the plaintiff. Invoking the\n\nFTCA, he filed an administrative claim with the VA on August 16,\n\n2005, alleging negligent reduction of his disability benefits.            By\n\nlaw, the VA had six months within which to respond.              28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2675(a).    On December 22, 2005, the VA denied the claim.2             It\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       On October 7, 2005, the plaintiff filed a premature civil\naction in the district court.    The court dismissed this action\nwithout prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\nNeither the commencement nor the termination of this action is\nmaterial to the issues on appeal.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fexplained that the plaintiff's exclusive remedy was the award of\n\nretroactive benefits (already received).\n\n            The VA's response laid out the plaintiff's options for\n\nfurther review.     It informed him that he could either file for\n\nadministrative reconsideration or sue under the FTCA.              The letter\n\nspelled out the temporal limitations that applied to each of these\n\noptions.    The plaintiff did nothing within the time allotted (six\n\nmonths).\n\n            On   August    8,   2006,    the   plaintiff   filed    a   second\n\nadministrative claim with the VA, once again alleging negligent\n\nreduction of his benefits.       This second claim went unanswered.\n\n            On April 2 or 3, 2007 — the record is tenebrous, but the\n\nexact date makes no difference — the plaintiff sued the government\n\nin the United States District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico.   See 28 U.S.C. § 1346.     The plaintiff's complaint sounded the\n\nsame theme adumbrated in the two administrative claims, premising\n\nthe government’s liability on an allegedly negligent reduction of\n\nbenefits.   The government moved to dismiss, arguing that the court\n\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction because the suit had not been\n\nfiled within two years next following the accrual of the cause of\n\naction.

In\n\nthe FTCA, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671-2680, Congress waived the\n\ngovernment's   sovereign   immunity      with   respect    to   private   tort\n\nactions.     That   waiver,   however,     is   hedged    by    a   number   of\n\nrestrictions and conditions.      See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a)-(n);\n\nsee also Fothergill, 566 F.3d at 252.

We begin with the six-month filing deadline following\n\nthe denial of an administrative claim.    The district court based\n\nits analysis on the two-year claim-filing deadline following the\n\naccrual of the claim.    It did not discuss the six-month filing\n\ndeadline, assuming that the second administrative claim, filed on\n\nAugust 8, 2006, was the operative filing.     The court's analysis\n\ntherefore proceeded on the assumption that the six-month window for\n\nthe commencement of suit opened on February 8, 2007 (the effective\n\ndenial date of the second administrative claim).     See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2675(a) (stating that the \"failure of an agency to make final\n\ndisposition of a claim within six months after it is filed shall\n\n. . . be deemed a final denial of the claim\").      Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court regarded the suit initiated in early April of 2007\n\nas timely filed.\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f                On appeal, the government argues that the plaintiff's\n\nfirst administrative claim was the operative filing for the purpose\n\nof measuring the six-month window.            Since the VA denied that claim\n\non December 22, 2005, the government posits, the window closed on\n\nJune 22, 2006. Thus, the plaintiff's suit, commenced in early April\n\nof 2007, overshot the deadline.\n\n                The plaintiff's riposte is twofold.      First, he says that\n\nthis argument is waived because the government did not advance it\n\nbelow.     Second, he maintains that the later administrative claim\n\ncomprises the correct point of reference.\n\n                The waiver argument is easily dismissed. Compliance with\n\nthe FTCA's temporal deadlines is both mandatory and jurisdictional.\n\nGonzález, 284 F.3d at 288; González-Bernal v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544228\"><a href=\"/opinion/544228/carmen-delia-gonzalez-bernal-etc-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1st Cir.          1990).        It is a familiar rule that\n\nchallenges to a federal court's subject matter jurisdiction can be\n\nraised at any stage of the litigation.            See, e.g., ConnectU LLC v.\n\nZuckerberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203264\"><a href=\"/opinion/203264/connectu-llc-v-zuckerberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86 n.2 (1st Cir. 2008); Am.

That   rule    controls    here:   this   particular\n\njurisdictional question, although raised by the government for the\n\nfirst time on appeal, is properly before us.\n\n                The dilemma created by the duplicative administrative\n\nclaims is more apparent than real.            The papers in the case describe\n\nonly a single injury: the (allegedly negligent) reduction of the\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fplaintiff's disability benefits.          Even without the claim forms\n\n(which are not part of the record on appeal),3 the only inference\n\nthat can be drawn is that both claims relate to that injury.           See\n\n32 C.F.R. § 750.26(c) (\"A claim is a notice . . . of an incident\n\ngiving rise to Government liability . . . .\").                From a legal\n\nstandpoint, then, the second claim is the functional equivalent of\n\nthe first.\n\n             Where,   as   here,    a   party   has   filed    duplicative\n\nadministrative claims, an inquiring court can regard the second\n\nclaim in one of two ways: as either an attempt to re-file the\n\noriginal claim or an attempt to have the agency reconsider its\n\ndisposition of the original claim.        Either way, the second claim in\n\nthis case is a nullity.     We explain briefly.\n\n             If we view the second claim as an attempt to re-file, it\n\nwould not reconfigure the FTCA time line.          Nothing to change the\n\nsubstance of the claims occurred in the interval between the first\n\nand   second   filings.     Under   these    circumstances,    the   second\n\nadministrative claim served no legitimate purpose.\n\n             That conclusion divests the second claim of any legal\n\neffect.   After all, it would be pointless for a court to allow a\n\nclaimant an opportunity to reopen the FTCA's limitations window by\n\n\n\n      3\n       The plaintiff, as the party prosecuting the appeal, has the\nresponsibility to ensure that the record on appeal is complete.\nSee Fed.

The first administrative\n\nclaim was denied on December 22, 2005. The plaintiff had six months\n\nfrom that date within which to sue.5       See 28 U.S.C. § 2401(b).   The\n\nplaintiff commenced his suit on April 2 or 3, 2007.        This was one\n\nyear, three months, and ten or eleven days after the denial of the\n\nrelevant administrative claim.       Accordingly, this suit is untimely.\n\nSee Vélez-Díaz v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n               The plaintiff's suit is untimely on a second ground as\n\nwell.       As the district court recognized, the plaintiff did not file\n\neither administrative claim with the VA within two years after his\n\ncause of action accrued.         This is a fatal flaw.    See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2401(b).\n\n               For FTCA purposes, a claim accrues upon the occurrence of\n\nthe underlying injury.        Callahan v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201862\"><a href=\"/opinion/201862/callahan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n450-51 (1st Cir. 2005).       This moment is pinpointed at the time the\n\ninjured party knows of the existence and the cause of his injury.\n\nId. at 451.       Something less than full knowledge suffices to start\n\nthe running of the FTCA limitations period. Skwira, 344 F.3d at 78.\n\n\n        5\n       The plaintiff does not argue that this six-month period was\nsomehow tolled.   Any such argument is, therefore, waived.     See\nUnited States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 n.7 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fAccrual is triggered by the discovery of sufficient facts about the\n\ninjury and its cause to prompt a reasonable person to seek advice\n\nto decide if there is a basis for filing a claim.              Callahan, 426\n\nF.3d at 451; Skwira, 344 F.3d at 78.\n\n             The plaintiff contends that he had no knowledge of the\n\nexistence or cause of his injury until October of 2004, when the\n\nBoard agreed that the reduction of his disability rating was the\n\nresult of clear and unmistakable error.            Like the district court,\n\nwe find this argument unconvincing.            At bottom, it is an effort to\n\nredefine what constitutes accrual.          See, e.g., Callahan, 426 F.3d\n\nat 450-51.\n\n             The plaintiff knew all the pertinent facts about his\n\ninjury when he was first notified of the impending decrease in his\n\ndisability rating on July 24, 1975.            His repeated efforts to have\n\nhis rating increased highlight this knowledge.                 He also knew\n\ndefinitively of the causal connection between the VA's action and\n\nhis injury by November 21, 1985. It was on that date that the Board\n\ndenied his petition to restore his disability rating.               Thus, the\n\nplaintiff's claim, for FTCA purposes, accrued by November of 1985.\n\nHe had two years from that time in which to initiate the FTCA claim-\n\nfiling process.     He missed this deadline.\n\n             In   his   reply   brief,   the    plaintiff   makes   a   related\n\nassertion that it was the VA's acknowledgment of error and inept\n\nhandling over time, rather than the original incorrect decision to\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\freduce his disability rating, that triggered the running of the\n\ntwo-year limitations period. Whether or not that would be a viable\n\nclaim had the plaintiff made it — a matter on which we take no view\n\n— his complaint belies that depiction of the claim.   It alleges at\n\nthe outset that the harm was the erroneous reduction of his\n\ndisability rating, simpliciter.   It is too late in the day for the\n\nplaintiff to switch his theory of the case.       See B&T Masonry\n\nConstr. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Mut. Ins.
