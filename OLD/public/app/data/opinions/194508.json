Appellant  Frank  Thorpe sued\n                            \n\nMutual  of Omaha  Insurance Company  (\"Mutual of  Omaha\") for\n\nalleged  emotional distress  and violation  of Mass.  Gen. L.\n\nchs.  93A  and 176D.    The claims  were  based on  Mutual of\n\nOmaha's surveillance  of Thorpe  in connection with  Thorpe's\n\nreceipt  of disability  benefits under  an insurance  policy.\n\nThorpe appeals  from rulings below granting  summary judgment\n\nin  favor  of Mutual  of Omaha  on  the statutory  claims and\n\ndirecting  judgment  for Mutual  of  Omaha  on the  emotional\n\ndistress claim.  We affirm both rulings. \n\n     Thorpe is a former  police officer who sustained serious\n\ninjuries,  including   a  contusion  to  the   heart,  in  an\n\nemployment-related automobile accident in 1975.  As a result,\n\nThorpe  retired from  the police  force and  began collecting\n\nmonthly total disability benefits  under a policy with Mutual\n\nof Omaha.  In order to verify Thorpe's continued eligibility,\n\nMutual of  Omaha representatives regularly  visited Thorpe at\n\nhis home and inquired into his daily activities and prospects\n\nfor rehabilitation.\n\n     Beginning in  1982, personal contact with  Thorpe became\n\nincreasingly difficult;  on several occasions,  Thorpe either\n\nwas  not at home  or did not  come to the  door.  The problem\n\nreached a head in early 1983, when Mutual of Omaha was unable\n\nto  contact   Thorpe  at  home   despite  repeated  attempts.\n\nSuspecting  that  Thorpe might  be  working  during the  day,\n\n                             -2-\n\nMutual of Omaha began  surveillance of Thorpe in  April 1983.\n\nOn the  second day  of surveillance, Thorpe  was driving  his\n\nformer  wife  to  work when  he  noticed  that  he was  being\n\nfollowed by  another car.    Thorpe took  evasive action  and\n\neventually ended up behind the tailing car, then being driven\n\nby the insurance company's agent, Michael Boyd.  According to\n\nThorpe and his former wife, Thorpe pulled up alongside Boyd's\n\ncar,  at which  point  Boyd tried  to  ram his  vehicle  into\n\nThorpe's  car before  driving  off, an  allegation denied  by\n\nBoyd.  As Thorpe  was driving home, he  experienced temporary\n\nchest pains. \n\n     Undeterred, Mutual  of Omaha resumed its surveillance of\n\nThorpe one  month later,  this time employing  a professional\n\nPinkerton agent.   Thorpe  again realized  that he  was being\n\nfollowed and, as with Boyd, claimed that the  Pinkerton agent\n\ntried  to hit his vehicle.  The Pinkerton agent denied trying\n\nto hit Thorpe's car.  The insurance company never established\n\nthat Thorpe was  working and,  to this day,  he continues  to\n\nreceive monthly disability payments.\n\n     On April  18, 1986,  Thorpe brought this  action against\n\nMutual of Omaha  in the Superior Court  of Massachusetts, the\n\ncase  being  then  removed  to  federal  court  on  diversity\n\ngrounds.     Thorpe  asserted   claims  for  intentional  and\n\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress and for  violation\n\nof Mass.  Gen. L. chs. 93A  and 176D.  After  some discovery,\n\n                             -3-\n\nMutual of Omaha  moved for summary  judgement on all  counts.\n\nThe  district  judge granted  summary  judgment  only on  the\n\nstatutory claims,  ruling that the  \"demand letter\"  required\n\nunder  chapter 93A  did not  sufficiently specify  the injury\n\nsuffered and damages claimed by Thorpe. \n\n     The remaining tort counts were tried before a jury and a\n\ndifferent judge in November  1991.  At  the close of all  the\n\nevidence,   Thorpe  voluntarily   dismissed  his   claim  for\n\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress, leaving  only the\n\nintentional  infliction  claim to  be  decided  by the  jury.\n\nShortly after  the  jury  began  deliberations,  the  foreman\n\nnotified  the  trial  judge  in writing  that  the  jury  was\n\ndeadlocked  five  to  one.    Two  more  notes  followed, one\n\ndescribing the hold-out juror as possessing \"deep ideological\n\nbeliefs that will not  be changed by any arguments,\"  and the\n\nother saying that  the hold-out \"developed a bias\" toward one\n\nof  the  parties  \"during  the   course  of  the  trial   and\n\ndeliberations . . . .\"  \n\n     At this  point, the  trial judge considered  declaring a\n\nmistrial but, before doing  so, posed the following questions\n\nto the jury over the objections of Thorpe's counsel:\n\n     1.   Did Mr. Boyd attempt to ram plaintiff's car?\n\n     2.   Did Mr.  Doucher (the  Pinkerton agent) .  . .\n          attempt to ram plaintiff's car?\n\nThe jury  promptly answered  both questions in  the negative.\n\nHaving obtained these findings, the court discharged the jury\n\n                             -4-\n\nand  directed \"judgment  as a  matter of  law\" for  Mutual of\n\nOmaha,  the rubric  that has  replaced directed  verdicts and\n\njudgments  n.o.v.   See  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  50.   This  appeal\n                       \n\nensued.\n\n     Thorpe's statutory  claim rests  upon Mass. Gen.  L. ch.\n\n93A, prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the\n\nconduct  of trade or commerce.1   As a  prerequisite to suit,\n\nchapter  93A  requires  the  submission of  a  demand  letter\n\n\"reasonably  describing  the  unfair  or  deceptive   act  or\n\npractice relied upon and the injury suffered.\"  Mass. Gen. L.\n\nch. 93A    9(3).  The twin reasons for the demand letter are,\n\nfirst, to encourage negotiation  and settlement and,  second,\n\nto  control   the  amount  of  damages   recoverable  by  the\n\nplaintiff.   Slaney v.  Westwood Auto,  Inc., 366  Mass. 688,\n                                            \n\n704,  322 N.E.2d 768, 779 (1975).  If a reasonable settlement\n\noffer is rejected  by the plaintiff, recovery will be limited\n\nto the amount of the offer. Id.\n                              \n\n     The  district court  in  this case  found that  Thorpe's\n\ndemand letter was specific about neither the alleged physical\n\nharm  sustained nor the  damages requested.   The letter from\n\nThorpe's  lawyer, dated  February 3,  1984, asserts  that the\n\n                    \n\n     1Thorpe also invoked chapter 176D prohibiting unfair and\ndeceptive insurance practices, but  that statute provides  no\nprivate  cause  of  action and  is  enforceable  only by  the\ncommissioner of insurance.  See Dodd v. Commercial Union Ins.\n                                                             \nCo., 373  Mass.  72,  365  N.E.2d  802  (1977)  (chapter  93A\n   \nencompasses unfair and deceptive insurance practices).\n\n                             -5-\n\ninsurance   company's   \"surveillance   technics  [sic]   and\n\nextensive  harassment\" inflicted on  Thorpe \"severe emotional\n\ndistress, as well as  physical injuries, great pain   of body\n\nand  mind, and  mental  anguish.\"    There was,  however,  no\n\nidentification of  any physical injuries and,  when Mutual of\n\nOmaha wrote  back inviting Thorpe's attorney  to identify and\n\nprovide  evidence of  \"any specific  injury or  harm  to your\n\nclient,\" its  letter went  unanswered.  Thorpe's  letter also\n\ndid not contain any damage figure which might have given some\n\ndimension to his claims.\n\n     We agree  with the  district court that  Thorpe's letter\n\ndid not satisfy  the statute.  The  Massachusetts courts have\n\nsaid  that  \"[i]t is  . .  .  essential that  the complainant\n\ndefine  the injury  suffered  and the  relief  demanded in  a\n\nmanner  that  provides  the  prospective defendant  with  `an\n\nopportunity to review the  facts and the law involved  to see\n\nif the  requested  relief should  be granted  or denied'  and\n\nenables him  to make  `a reasonable tender  of settlement.'\"2\n\nGiven the failure to  specify at least the  physical injuries\n\nclaimed, Thorpe's  letter provided no adequate  basis for the\n\ninsurance company to appraise the value of the claim or frame\n\na settlement offer.      Thorpe's second  ground for reversal\n\ncenters on the  trial court's submission of  questions to the\n\n                    \n\n     2Spring  v. Geriatric  Authority of  Holyoke, 394  Mass.\n                                                 \n274, 288,  475 N.E.2d  727, 736 (1985)  (quoting Slaney,  366\n                                                       \nMass. at 704-05, 322 N.E.2d at 779).\n\n                             -6-\n\njury on the  issue of  attempted \"ramming\"  of Thorpe's  car.\n\nFederal  Rule of Civil  Procedure 49(a) permits  the court to\n\nrequire from  the jury \"a  special verdict  in the form  of a\n\nspecific written finding  upon each issue  of fact.\"   Thorpe\n\nclaims  that the  procedure was  inappropriate in  this case,\n\narguing  that the jury did not return a general verdict, that\n\nRule 49 does  not provide  for submission of  questions to  a\n\ndeadlocked  jury, and that one  of the jurors  was biased and\n\ntherefore incapable of answering the questions impartially.\n\n     The  first   two  contentions  were   not  made   below.\n\nArguments not made to  the district court in civil  cases are\n\nforeclosed on  appeal unless their inclusion would \"virtually\n\n. . . insure appellant's success\" and exclusion would  result\n\nin  a \"gross  miscarriage  of justice.\"    Jones v.  City  of\n                                                             \n\nSomerville, 735  F.2d 5,  7  (1st Cir.  1984).    Rule  49(a)\n          \n\nexplicitly  permits  special  verdicts  in  lieu  of  general\n\nverdicts, compare  Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 49(b)  (providing for  a\n                 \n\ngeneral verdict with interrogatories), and while Rule 49 does\n\nnot  specifically address  the submission  of questions  to a\n\njury  after a  deadlock, neither  does it  expressly preclude\n\nthis practice.  Patently, there was no clear violation of the\n\nFederal Rules or any miscarriage of justice.\n\n     Thorpe's third  argument,  properly made  at  trial  and\n\npreserved  for  appeal,  is  that  it  was  error  to  submit\n\nquestions to the jury  because one of the jurors  was biased.\n\n                             -7-\n\nThe short answer is that the jury foreman's statements do not\n\nestablish  or even  strongly  suggest bias  in the  technical\n\nsense that would require  removal of the hold-out juror  or a\n\nmistrial.   Compare, e.g., United States v.  Heller, 785 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1524 (11th Cir. 1986) (racial  and religious slurs uttered by\n\njury members).  For all that appears, the hold-out juror came\n\nto  a  firm conviction  based on  the  evidence at  trial and\n\nrefused  to budge.   What were  \"ideological beliefs\"  to the\n\nforeman  may be \"personal values\"  to the hold-out.   At most\n\nThorpe  might have been entitled to a voir dire inquiry; none\n\nwas sought; and  the situation certainly did not  require the\n\ntrial judge to order one sua sponte.\n                                   \n\n     Lastly, Thorpe challenges the  district court's entry of\n\njudgment  for Mutual  of Omaha  on the  claim of  intentional\n\ninfliction of  emotional distress.  In  directing judgment on\n\nthis  count,   the   trial  court   properly  excluded   from\n\nconsideration testimony  on the subject of  \"car ramming,\" as\n\nthis  issue was resolved  by the jury  in favor of  Mutual of\n\nOmaha.   Still, Thorpe  contends that the  remaining evidence\n\nelicited  at trial was sufficient  to submit to  the jury his\n\nclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n     Thorpe  first  points out  that  a  different judge  had\n\nearlier denied Mutual of  Omaha's motion for summary judgment\n\non this claim, suggesting \"reasonable minds could differ\" and\n\nthe jury should therefore decide the matter.  Cf. Anderson v.\n                                                          \n\n                             -8-\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477  U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986).   A denial\n                  \n\nof summary judgment  does not preclude a directed  verdict on\n\nthe same  claim.  See, e.g.,  see Voutour v. Vitale  761 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n812, 822-23  (1st Cir.  1985),  cert. denied,  474 U.S.  1100\n                                            \n\n(1986).  Evidence adduced at  trial will almost always differ\n\nin  degree, force,  and  quantity from  that  submitted on  a\n\nmotion  for summary judgment.   The earlier denial of summary\n\njudgment  standing  alone  in  no  way  impeaches  the  later\n\ndirected verdict.\n\n     Turning to the evidence  at trial, we note first  that a\n\nplaintiff  claiming  intentional   infliction  of   emotional\n\ndistress  under  Massachusetts  law must  establish  that the\n\nactor  intended  to inflict  emotional  distress  or knew  or\n\nshould  have known  that  emotional distress  was the  likely\n\nresult  of his  conduct;  that the  conduct was  \"extreme and\n\noutrageous,\" \"was beyond all possible bounds of decency,\" and\n\nwas \"utterly intolerable in  a civilized community;\" that the\n\nactions were  the cause of the plaintiff's distress; and that\n\nthe  emotional   distress  sustained  by  the  plaintiff  was\n\n\"severe\"  and of a nature that no reasonable person \"could be\n\nexpected to endure.\"   Agis v. Massachusetts,  377 Mass. 140,\n                                            \n\n144-45,  355 N.E.2d  315, 318-19  (1976).   In our  view, the\n\nsurveillance  did not  even  arguably rise  to  the level  of\n\n\"extreme and outrageous conduct,\"  and the issue was properly\n\n                             -9-\n\nwithdrawn from the jury.3   Once the claims of  attempted car\n\nramming are removed from  dispute, the behavior complained of\n\namounts to not much more  than an insurance company's efforts\n\nto determine the  activities of a  claimant whose receipt  of\n\nbenefits   was   conditioned   on   his   total   disability.\n\nInvestigations  of  this  sort  are  commonplace  and  to  be\n\nexpected where disability  claims are involved,  particularly\n\nwhere, as here, the claimant was from all outward appearances\n\noften away from home during the day.  However distasteful the\n\nnotion of surveillance, Mutual of Omaha's conduct in relation\n\nto  Thorpe  was  not  \"extreme  or  outrageous\"  or  \"utterly\n\nintolerable in a civilized society.\"\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                    \n\n     3Although the issue is  one which a jury is  well suited\nto  decide,  the  judge  is   still  expected  to  apply  the\ntraditional test--could a reasonable jury find the conduct to\nviolate the tort standard--in  deciding whether to submit the\nissue to the  jury.

The claims  were  based on  Mutual of\n\nOmaha's surveillance  of Thorpe  in connection with  Thorpe's\n\nreceipt  of disability  benefits under  an insurance  policy.\n\nThorpe appeals  from rulings below granting  summary judgment\n\nin  favor  of Mutual  of Omaha  on  the statutory  claims and\n\ndirecting  judgment  for Mutual  of  Omaha  on the  emotional\n\ndistress claim.  We affirm both rulings. \n\n     Thorpe is a former  police officer who sustained serious\n\ninjuries,  including   a  contusion  to  the   heart,  in  an\n\nemployment-related automobile accident in 1975.  As a result,\n\nThorpe  retired from  the police  force and  began collecting\n\nmonthly total disability benefits  under a policy with Mutual\n\nof Omaha.  In order to verify Thorpe's continued eligibility,\n\nMutual of  Omaha representatives regularly  visited Thorpe at\n\nhis home and inquired into his daily activities and prospects\n\nfor rehabilitation.\n\n     Beginning in  1982, personal contact with  Thorpe became\n\nincreasingly difficult;  on several occasions,  Thorpe either\n\nwas  not at home  or did not  come to the  door.  The problem\n\nreached a head in early 1983, when Mutual of Omaha was unable\n\nto  contact   Thorpe  at  home   despite  repeated  attempts.\n\nSuspecting  that  Thorpe might  be  working  during the  day,\n\n                             -2-\n\nMutual of Omaha began  surveillance of Thorpe in  April 1983.\n\nOn the  second day  of surveillance, Thorpe  was driving  his\n\nformer  wife  to  work when  he  noticed  that  he was  being\n\nfollowed by  another car.    Thorpe took  evasive action  and\n\neventually ended up behind the tailing car, then being driven\n\nby the insurance company's agent, Michael Boyd.  According to\n\nThorpe and his former wife, Thorpe pulled up alongside Boyd's\n\ncar,  at which  point  Boyd tried  to  ram his  vehicle  into\n\nThorpe's  car before  driving  off, an  allegation denied  by\n\nBoyd.  As Thorpe  was driving home, he  experienced temporary\n\nchest pains. \n\n     Undeterred, Mutual  of Omaha resumed its surveillance of\n\nThorpe one  month later,  this time employing  a professional\n\nPinkerton agent.   Thorpe  again realized  that he  was being\n\nfollowed and, as with Boyd, claimed that the  Pinkerton agent\n\ntried  to hit his vehicle.  The Pinkerton agent denied trying\n\nto hit Thorpe's car.  The insurance company never established\n\nthat Thorpe was  working and,  to this day,  he continues  to\n\nreceive monthly disability payments.\n\n     On April  18, 1986,  Thorpe brought this  action against\n\nMutual of Omaha  in the Superior Court  of Massachusetts, the\n\ncase  being  then  removed  to  federal  court  on  diversity\n\ngrounds.     Thorpe  asserted   claims  for  intentional  and\n\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress and for  violation\n\nof Mass.  Gen. L. chs. 93A  and 176D.  After  some discovery,\n\n                             -3-\n\nMutual of Omaha  moved for summary  judgement on all  counts.\n\nThe  district  judge granted  summary  judgment  only on  the\n\nstatutory claims,  ruling that the  \"demand letter\"  required\n\nunder  chapter 93A  did not  sufficiently specify  the injury\n\nsuffered and damages claimed by Thorpe. \n\n     The remaining tort counts were tried before a jury and a\n\ndifferent judge in November  1991.  At  the close of all  the\n\nevidence,   Thorpe  voluntarily   dismissed  his   claim  for\n\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress, leaving  only the\n\nintentional  infliction  claim to  be  decided  by the  jury.\n\nShortly after  the  jury  began  deliberations,  the  foreman\n\nnotified  the  trial  judge  in writing  that  the  jury  was\n\ndeadlocked  five  to  one.    Two  more  notes  followed, one\n\ndescribing the hold-out juror as possessing \"deep ideological\n\nbeliefs that will not  be changed by any arguments,\"  and the\n\nother saying that  the hold-out \"developed a bias\" toward one\n\nof  the  parties  \"during  the   course  of  the  trial   and\n\ndeliberations . . . .\"  \n\n     At this  point, the  trial judge considered  declaring a\n\nmistrial but, before doing  so, posed the following questions\n\nto the jury over the objections of Thorpe's counsel:\n\n     1.   Did Mr. Boyd attempt to ram plaintiff's car?\n\n     2.   Did Mr.  Doucher (the  Pinkerton agent) .  . .\n          attempt to ram plaintiff's car?\n\nThe jury  promptly answered  both questions in  the negative.\n\nHaving obtained these findings, the court discharged the jury\n\n                             -4-\n\nand  directed \"judgment  as a  matter of  law\" for  Mutual of\n\nOmaha,  the rubric  that has  replaced directed  verdicts and\n\njudgments  n.o.v.   See  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  50.   This  appeal\n                       \n\nensued.\n\n     Thorpe's statutory  claim rests  upon Mass. Gen.  L. ch.\n\n93A, prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the\n\nconduct  of trade or commerce.1   As a  prerequisite to suit,\n\nchapter  93A  requires  the  submission of  a  demand  letter\n\n\"reasonably  describing  the  unfair  or  deceptive   act  or\n\npractice relied upon and the injury suffered.\"  Mass. Gen. L.\n\nch. 93A    9(3).  The twin reasons for the demand letter are,\n\nfirst, to encourage negotiation  and settlement and,  second,\n\nto  control   the  amount  of  damages   recoverable  by  the\n\nplaintiff.

Thorpe's  letter also\n\ndid not contain any damage figure which might have given some\n\ndimension to his claims.\n\n     We agree  with the  district court that  Thorpe's letter\n\ndid not satisfy  the statute.  The  Massachusetts courts have\n\nsaid  that  \"[i]t is  . .  .  essential that  the complainant\n\ndefine  the injury  suffered  and the  relief  demanded in  a\n\nmanner  that  provides  the  prospective defendant  with  `an\n\nopportunity to review the  facts and the law involved  to see\n\nif the  requested  relief should  be granted  or denied'  and\n\nenables him  to make  `a reasonable tender  of settlement.'\"2\n\nGiven the failure to  specify at least the  physical injuries\n\nclaimed, Thorpe's  letter provided no adequate  basis for the\n\ninsurance company to appraise the value of the claim or frame\n\na settlement offer.

Patently, there was no clear violation of the\n\nFederal Rules or any miscarriage of justice.\n\n     Thorpe's third  argument,  properly made  at  trial  and\n\npreserved  for  appeal,  is  that  it  was  error  to  submit\n\nquestions to the jury  because one of the jurors  was biased.\n\n                             -7-\n\nThe short answer is that the jury foreman's statements do not\n\nestablish  or even  strongly  suggest bias  in the  technical\n\nsense that would require  removal of the hold-out juror  or a\n\nmistrial.   Compare, e.g., United States v.  Heller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466332\"><a href=\"/opinion/466332/united-states-v-daniel-neal-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                   \n\n<span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1986) (racial  and religious slurs uttered by\n\njury members).  For all that appears, the hold-out juror came\n\nto  a  firm conviction  based on  the  evidence at  trial and\n\nrefused  to budge.   What were  \"ideological beliefs\"  to the\n\nforeman  may be \"personal values\"  to the hold-out.   At most\n\nThorpe  might have been entitled to a voir dire inquiry; none\n\nwas sought; and  the situation certainly did not  require the\n\ntrial judge to order one sua sponte.\n                                   \n\n     Lastly, Thorpe challenges the  district court's entry of\n\njudgment  for Mutual  of Omaha  on the  claim of  intentional\n\ninfliction of  emotional distress.  In  directing judgment on\n\nthis  count,   the   trial  court   properly  excluded   from\n\nconsideration testimony  on the subject of  \"car ramming,\" as\n\nthis  issue was resolved  by the jury  in favor of  Mutual of\n\nOmaha.   Still, Thorpe  contends that the  remaining evidence\n\nelicited  at trial was sufficient  to submit to  the jury his\n\nclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n     Thorpe  first  points out  that  a  different judge  had\n\nearlier denied Mutual of  Omaha's motion for summary judgment\n\non this claim, suggesting \"reasonable minds could differ\" and\n\nthe jury should therefore decide the matter.  Cf.

However distasteful the\n\nnotion of surveillance, Mutual of Omaha's conduct in relation\n\nto  Thorpe  was  not  \"extreme  or  outrageous\"  or  \"utterly\n\nintolerable in a civilized society.\"\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                    \n\n     3Although the issue is  one which a jury is  well suited\nto  decide,  the  judge  is   still  expected  to  apply  the\ntraditional test--could a reasonable jury find the conduct to\nviolate the tort standard--in  deciding whether to submit the\nissue to the  jury.
