Robert  Lyons, Attorneys, Tax\n                                               \nDivision, Department of Justice, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per  Curiam.     Rahmat  A.  Niazmand  is appealing\n                     \n\ncertain  adverse rulings  by the  Tax Court,  rendered in  an\n\nopinion which had otherwise found in his favor (i.e., that he\n\ndid not owe income taxes for certain tax years).  We affirm.\n\n          In 1991, the Internal Revenue Service sent Niazmand\n\na notice of deficiency stating  that he owed income taxes and\n\nadditions  to tax for  the years  1979-83 and  1985-86, which\n\nwere years  in which Niazmand  had neither filed  tax returns\n\nnor paid any  income tax.   Niazmand filed a petition  in Tax\n\nCourt, challenging the IRS's determination and  claiming that\n\nthe IRS owed  him a refund since  he had overpaid his  income\n\ntax in 1978.   He later amended his  petition to seek refunds\n\nfor previous  years because  of losses  incurred in  1978 and\n\n1979, which he sought to have carried back  to years in which\n\nhe had paid  income taxes.  Thereafter, Niazmand  and the IRS\n\nentered into  a  stipulation that  Niazmand did  not owe  any\n\nincome tax  for the years  1979-83 and 1985-86 as  claimed in\n\nthe   deficiency   notice.      Niazmand,   however,   sought\n\nadjudication of two other issues:  whether he was entitled to\n\nrefunds for  the 1975-78 tax  years, and what the  amount and\n\nnature was of  a loss he had  incurred in 1979.   Evidence on\n\nthose issues was presented at trial.  In addition, with court\n\napproval,  Niazmand  introduced evidence   to  substantiate a\n\nclaim he intended  to make for  litigation costs,   although,\n\nunder Tax  Court Rule 231,  Niazmand could not file  a motion\n\n                             -2-\n\nfor litigation  costs until  after the court  had served  its\n\nwritten opinion.   Soon  after the  trial, however,  Niazmand\n\nfiled  a motion  seeking  permission  to  file a  motion  for\n\nlitigation costs early,  which the Tax Court  denied the same\n\nday as it served its written opinion.  \n\n          The  Tax Court found  that Niazmand owed  no income\n\ntax or  additions to tax  for the years 1979-83  and 1985-86.\n\nIt  also  found  that it  had  no  jurisdiction  to determine\n\nwhether  Niazmand  had made  overpayments (and  thus deserved\n\nrefunds) for the taxable years 1975-78, since the IRS had not\n\ndetermined that there  were any deficiencies in  tax paid for\n\nthose  years.  Concerning  Niazmand's claims relating  to the\n\n1979 loss, the court essentially  said that the only question\n\nproperly  before it  was  whether Niazmand  owed the  IRS any\n\nincome  tax for the years 1979-83 and 1985-86, as the IRS had\n\noriginally claimed.  Since Niazmand had not filed any returns\n\nor paid any  taxes for those years, however,  the question of\n\noverpayments  by Niazmand  for  those years  (which  included\n\n1979) did  not arise.   Moreover, since Niazmand did  not owe\n\nany income  tax for 1979, the court  concluded that it had no\n\nneed to decide  whether Niazmand had suffered a  loss in 1979\n\ngreater  than  the amount  conceded  by  the IRS,  i.e.,  the\n\nconceded amount sufficed to show that Niazmand owed no income\n\ntax for 1979.   (In a  footnote, the court  said that it  was\n\n\"most unlikely\" that Niazmand's alleged losses could  qualify\n\n                             -3-\n\nfor   ordinary  loss  treatment  under  26  U.S.C.     1244.)\n\nFinally, the  court concluded that  it would be  premature to\n\ndecide whether to  award Niazmand his litigation  costs since\n\nTax Court Rule 231 required  a motion for litigation costs to\n\nbe  filed  after  service  of  the written  opinion.    In  a\n\nfootnote, the court  indicated that Niazmand was  unlikely to\n\nprevail on any such motion in any event.  \n\n          On  appeal,  Niazmand  argues that  the  Tax  Court\n\nshould have determined whether the  IRS owed him a refund for\n\npre-1979 tax  years and what  the precise amount of  his loss\n\nfor 1979 was, but he cites no supporting authority.  Niazmand\n\nalso says that the Tax Court ignored an alleged concession by\n\nthe IRS at  trial that Niazmand's litigation  costs should be\n\nawarded to  him,  and that  he  had had  to file  his  motion\n\nseeking leave to  file an early  motion for litigation  costs\n\nbecause  a  family medical  emergency required  his departure\n\nfrom this country.   For the following reasons,  we find that\n\nhis arguments are not persuasive.  \n\n          First,  it is well  settled that the  Tax Court has\n\njurisdiction to  determine a  deficiency or overpayment  only\n\nfor tax  years for  which the  IRS has  sent  the taxpayer  a\n\nnotice of  deficiency, and  that it  may consider  facts from\n\nother  tax years only  as necessary to  correctly redetermine\n\nthe  taxpayer's liability for the  years for which the notice\n\nof deficiency  was  sent.   See  Harris v.  Commissioner,  29\n                                                        \n\n                             -4-\n\nT.C.M.  (CCH) 1510, 1511 (1970), aff'd, 73-1 U.S.T.C. (CCH)  \n                                      \n\n9205 (9th  Cir. 1972);  Crawford v.  Commissioner, 28  T.C.M.\n                                                 \n\n(CCH) 909, 910-11 (1969); see  also 26 U.S.C.   6214(b) (\"The\n                                   \n\nTax Court in redetermining a deficiency of income tax for any\n\ntaxable year . . . shall consider such facts with relation to\n\nthe  taxes for  other years  or calendar  quarters as  may be\n\nnecessary  correctly  to  redetermine   the  amount  of  such\n\ndeficiency,  but in  so doing  shall have no  jurisdiction to\n\ndetermine  whether or  not  the  tax for  any  other year  or\n\ncalendar   quarter  has   been   overpaid  or   underpaid.\").\n\nTherefore, the  Tax Court  had no  jurisdiction to  determine\n\nthat the IRS owed Niazmand  a refund for pre-1979 years since\n\nthe IRS  had not  determined that  Niazmand's income  tax was\n\ndeficient in those years.  \n\n          Second, if Niazmand  had paid income tax in 1979, a\n\nyear for which the IRS originally asserted a deficiency, then\n\nit might have been important to determine the exact amount of\n\nNiazmand's  loss  in  that year  in  order  to determine  his\n\ntaxable income and  the extent of his alleged  overpayment of\n\ntaxes.  But Niazmand did not  pay income tax in 1979, and  so\n\nhe could not  have overpaid his taxes  in that year,  and the\n\nTax Court  correctly found that  it had no need  to determine\n\nthe  precise amount of  Niazmand's losses.   Furthermore, the\n\nIRS had  conceded  that  there was  no  deficiency  in  1979,\n\nNiazmand had stipulated to the zero deficiency for that year,\n\n                             -5-\n\nand  the Tax  Court had  accepted  the parties'  stipulation.\n\nAccordingly, the Tax Court's determination that Niazmand owed\n\nno income  tax vindicated Niazmand fully with  respect to his\n\ntax position  in 1979, and  its determination would  not have\n\nbeen further aided  by fixing the precise amount  of the 1979\n\noperating   loss.     At  trial,   Niazmand   suggested  that\n\ncalculating  the operating  loss  was  important because  the\n\namount of the  loss could affect his tax  treatment in future\n\ntax  years.    The  court's   refusal  to  do  so  under  the\n\ncircumstances was  completely  appropriate.   Had  the  court\n\nfixed the  amount of  the operating  loss, its  determination\n\nwould  not have  affected issues then  before the  court, but\n\nwould essentially  have been an \"advisory opinion declarative\n\nof the deduction petitioner may be able to use in some future\n\nyears.\"   See  LTV Corporation  v.  Commissioner of  Internal\n                                                             \n\nRevenue, 64 T.C. 589, 593-96  (1975) (the Tax Court  declined\n       \n\nto determine  the precise amount of an alleged operating loss\n\nin part because  the IRS  had conceded  sufficient losses  to\n\noffset  any deficiencies in  petitioner's income tax  for the\n\ntax years  before the  court and  the alleged  operating loss\n\nwould  at  most  affect  tax  years  not  before  the court).\n\nNiazmand remains free to raise  the question of the amount of\n\nthe 1979 operating  loss in litigation concerning  future tax\n\nyears if necessary.  See Chevron Corporation v. Commissioner,\n                                                            \n\n98  T.C.  590,  592-93  (1992)  (the  Tax Court  declined  to\n\n                             -6-\n\nreclassify  petitioners'  income  where doing  so  would  not\n\naffect the taxable years in question and the doctrines of res\n\njudicata  and collateral estoppel  would not  bar petitioners\n\nfrom raising  questions about the  correct classification  of\n\nthe income in future litigation).1\n\n          Finally,  the IRS  agreed  to  permit  Niazmand  to\n\ntestify at trial  as to his alleged litigation  costs only in\n\norder to  establish a record on  which he could base  a later\n\nfiled motion  for litigation costs.  The  IRS did not say, as\n\nNiazmand now  contends, that  an award of  costs to  Niazmand\n\nshould  be  made.    Furthermore, at  trial  the  court  told\n\nNiazmand  explicitly that Tax Court Rule 231 required motions\n\nfor  litigation costs  to  be filed  only  during the  30-day\n\nperiod beginning on the date the Tax Court's  written opinion\n\n                    \n\n1.  On appeal, Niazmand claims that his pre-1980 losses would\naffect the amount  of losses for the years  1980-83 and 1985-\n86,  which  were  before  the   court.    His  contention  is\nunavailing  under the  circumstances  present  here.   Before\ntrial,  Niazmand   entered  into  a   stipulation  with   the\ngovernment  in which he  agreed that he  had negative taxable\nincome for the years in question, in the specific amounts set\nout  in the  stipulation.   He and  the government  submitted\ntheir stipulation as evidence to  be considered by the  court\nin arriving at its decision.  Niazmand's contention on appeal\namounts to an attempt to  retract that stipulation, and so we\nreject it.   For the same reason, we  deny Niazmand's request\nto consider his 1986 tax return on appeal (which the clerk of\nthis court treated as a  letter motion to expand the record).\nThe return was prepared and filed more than a year  after the\ntrial in this case, and shows a negative taxable income in an\namount  different than the amount originally stipulated to by\nNiazmand.\n\n                             -7-\n\nis  served, and  Niazmand indicated  that  he understood  the\n\nrequirements of the rule.  \n\n          Niazmand  has not shown that the Tax Court's denial\n\nof his motion  to file a motion  for costs in advance  of the\n\ndate  the  written  opinion  was  served  was  an   abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.   See, e.g.,  Estate of  Shafer v.  Commissioner,\n                                                            \n\n749 F.2d 1216, 1218 (6th Cir. 1984) (holding that Tax Court's\n\napplication of its procedural rules are reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion).  The  Tax Court routinely requires  taxpayers to\n\nconform to  the time  requirements of Rule  231.   See, e.g.,\n                                                             \n\nGroetzinger  v.

Niazmand is appealing certain adverse rulings by the Tax Court, rendered in an opinion which had otherwise found in his favor (i.e., that he did not owe income taxes for certain tax years).  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, the Internal Revenue Service sent Niazmand a notice of deficiency stating that he owed income taxes and additions to tax for the years 1979-83 and 1985-86, which were years in which Niazmand had neither filed tax returns nor paid any income tax.  Niazmand filed a petition in Tax Court, challenging the IRS's determination and claiming that the IRS owed him a refund since he had overpaid his income tax in 1978.  He later amended his petition to seek refunds for previous years because of losses incurred in 1978 and 1979, which he sought to have carried back to years in which he had paid income taxes.  Thereafter, Niazmand and the IRS entered into a stipulation that Niazmand did not owe any income tax for the years 1979-83 and 1985-86 as claimed in the deficiency notice.  Niazmand, however, sought adjudication of two other issues:  whether he was entitled to refunds for the 1975-78 tax years, and what the amount and nature was of a loss he had incurred in 1979.  Evidence on those issues was presented at trial.  In addition, with court approval, Niazmand introduced evidence to substantiate a claim he intended to make for litigation costs, although, under Tax Court Rule 231, Niazmand could not file a motion for litigation costs until after the court had served its written opinion.  Soon after the trial, however, Niazmand filed a motion seeking permission to file a motion for litigation costs early, which the Tax Court denied the same day as it served its written opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court found that Niazmand owed no income tax or additions to tax for the years 1979-83 and 1985-86.  It also found that it had no jurisdiction to determine whether Niazmand had made overpayments (and thus deserved refunds) for the taxable years 1975-78, since the IRS had not determined that there were any deficiencies in tax paid for those years.  Concerning Niazmand's claims relating to the 1979 loss, the court essentially said that the only question properly before it was whether Niazmand owed the IRS any income tax for the years 1979-83 and 1985-86, as the IRS had originally claimed.  Since Niazmand had not filed any returns or paid any taxes for those years, however, the question of overpayments by Niazmand for those years (which included 1979) did not arise.  Moreover, since Niazmand did not owe any income tax for 1979, the court concluded that it had no need to decide whether Niazmand had suffered a loss in 1979 greater than the amount conceded by the IRS, i.e., the conceded amount sufficed to show that Niazmand owed no income tax for 1979.  (In a footnote, the court said that it was \"most unlikely\" that Niazmand's alleged losses could qualify for ordinary loss treatment under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1244.)  Finally, the court concluded that it would be premature to decide whether to award Niazmand his litigation costs since Tax Court Rule 231 required a motion for litigation costs to be filed after service of the written opinion.  In a footnote, the court indicated that Niazmand was unlikely to prevail on any such motion in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Niazmand argues that the Tax Court should have determined whether the IRS owed him a refund for pre-1979 tax years and what the precise amount of his loss for 1979 was, but he cites no supporting authority.  Niazmand also says that the Tax Court ignored an alleged concession by the IRS at trial that Niazmand's litigation costs should be awarded to him, and that he had had to file his motion seeking leave to file an early motion for litigation costs because a family medical emergency required his departure from this country.  For the following reasons, we find that his arguments are not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is well settled that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to determine a deficiency or overpayment only for tax years for which the IRS has sent the taxpayer a notice of deficiency, and that it may consider facts from other tax years only as necessary to correctly redetermine the taxpayer's liability for the years for which the notice of deficiency was sent.

Sec. 6214(b) (\"The Tax Court in redetermining a deficiency of income tax for any taxable year ... shall consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other years or calendar quarters as may be necessary correctly to redetermine the amount of such deficiency, but in so doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for any other year or calendar quarter has been overpaid or underpaid.\").  Therefore, the Tax Court had no jurisdiction to determine that the IRS owed Niazmand a refund for pre-1979 years since the IRS had not determined that Niazmand's income tax was deficient in those years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if Niazmand had paid income tax in 1979, a year for which the IRS originally asserted a deficiency, then it might have been important to determine the exact amount of Niazmand's loss in that year in order to determine his taxable income and the extent of his alleged overpayment of taxes.  But Niazmand did not pay income tax in 1979, and so he could not have overpaid his taxes in that year, and the Tax Court correctly found that it had no need to determine the precise amount of Niazmand's losses.  Furthermore, the IRS had conceded that there was no deficiency in 1979, Niazmand had stipulated to the zero deficiency for that year, and the Tax Court had accepted the parties' stipulation.  Accordingly, the Tax Court's determination that Niazmand owed no income tax vindicated Niazmand fully with respect to his tax position in 1979, and its determination would not have been further aided by fixing the precise amount of the 1979 operating loss.  At trial, Niazmand suggested that calculating the operating loss was important because the amount of the loss could affect his tax treatment in future tax years.  The court's refusal to do so under the circumstances was completely appropriate.  Had the court fixed the amount of the operating loss, its determination would not have affected issues then before the court, but would essentially have been an \"advisory opinion declarative of the deduction petitioner may be able to use in some future years.\"   See LTV Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 64 T.C. 589, 593-96 (1975) (the Tax Court declined to determine the precise amount of an alleged operating loss in part because the IRS had conceded sufficient losses to offset any deficiencies in petitioner's income tax for the tax years before the court and the alleged operating loss would at most affect tax years not before the court).  Niazmand remains free to raise the question of the amount of the 1979 operating loss in litigation concerning future tax years if necessary.   See Chevron Corporation v. Commissioner, 98 T.C. 590, 592-93 (1992) (the Tax Court declined to reclassify petitioners' income where doing so would not affect the taxable years in question and the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel would not bar petitioners from raising questions about the correct classification of the income in future litigation).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the IRS agreed to permit Niazmand to testify at trial as to his alleged litigation costs only in order to establish a record on which he could base a later filed motion for litigation costs.  The IRS did not say, as Niazmand now contends, that an award of costs to Niazmand should be made.  Furthermore, at trial the court told Niazmand explicitly that Tax Court Rule 231 required motions for litigation costs to be filed only during the 30-day period beginning on the date the Tax Court's written opinion is served, and Niazmand indicated that he understood the requirements of the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Niazmand has not shown that the Tax Court's denial of his motion to file a motion for costs in advance of the date the written opinion was served was an abuse of discretion.

The Tax Court routinely requires taxpayers to conform to the time requirements of Rule 231.   See, e.g., Groetzinger v.

Niazmand is appealing certain adverse rulings by the Tax Court, rendered in an opinion which had otherwise found in his favor (i.e., that he did not owe income taxes for certain tax years).  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, the Internal Revenue Service sent Niazmand a notice of deficiency stating that he owed income taxes and additions to tax for the years 1979-83 and 1985-86, which were years in which Niazmand had neither filed tax returns nor paid any income tax.  Niazmand filed a petition in Tax Court, challenging the IRS's determination and claiming that the IRS owed him a refund since he had overpaid his income tax in 1978.  He later amended his petition to seek refunds for previous years because of losses incurred in 1978 and 1979, which he sought to have carried back to years in which he had paid income taxes.  Thereafter, Niazmand and the IRS entered into a stipulation that Niazmand did not owe any income tax for the years 1979-83 and 1985-86 as claimed in the deficiency notice.  Niazmand, however, sought adjudication of two other issues:  whether he was entitled to refunds for the 1975-78 tax years, and what the amount and nature was of a loss he had incurred in 1979.  Evidence on those issues was presented at trial.  In addition, with court approval, Niazmand introduced evidence to substantiate a claim he intended to make for litigation costs, although, under Tax Court Rule 231, Niazmand could not file a motion for litigation costs until after the court had served its written opinion.  Soon after the trial, however, Niazmand filed a motion seeking permission to file a motion for litigation costs early, which the Tax Court denied the same day as it served its written opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court found that Niazmand owed no income tax or additions to tax for the years 1979-83 and 1985-86.  It also found that it had no jurisdiction to determine whether Niazmand had made overpayments (and thus deserved refunds) for the taxable years 1975-78, since the IRS had not determined that there were any deficiencies in tax paid for those years.  Concerning Niazmand's claims relating to the 1979 loss, the court essentially said that the only question properly before it was whether Niazmand owed the IRS any income tax for the years 1979-83 and 1985-86, as the IRS had originally claimed.  Since Niazmand had not filed any returns or paid any taxes for those years, however, the question of overpayments by Niazmand for those years (which included 1979) did not arise.  Moreover, since Niazmand did not owe any income tax for 1979, the court concluded that it had no need to decide whether Niazmand had suffered a loss in 1979 greater than the amount conceded by the IRS, i.e., the conceded amount sufficed to show that Niazmand owed no income tax for 1979.  (In a footnote, the court said that it was \"most unlikely\" that Niazmand's alleged losses could qualify for ordinary loss treatment under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1244.)  Finally, the court concluded that it would be premature to decide whether to award Niazmand his litigation costs since Tax Court Rule 231 required a motion for litigation costs to be filed after service of the written opinion.  In a footnote, the court indicated that Niazmand was unlikely to prevail on any such motion in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Niazmand argues that the Tax Court should have determined whether the IRS owed him a refund for pre-1979 tax years and what the precise amount of his loss for 1979 was, but he cites no supporting authority.  Niazmand also says that the Tax Court ignored an alleged concession by the IRS at trial that Niazmand's litigation costs should be awarded to him, and that he had had to file his motion seeking leave to file an early motion for litigation costs because a family medical emergency required his departure from this country.  For the following reasons, we find that his arguments are not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is well settled that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to determine a deficiency or overpayment only for tax years for which the IRS has sent the taxpayer a notice of deficiency, and that it may consider facts from other tax years only as necessary to correctly redetermine the taxpayer's liability for the years for which the notice of deficiency was sent.  See Harris v. Commissioner, 29</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">T.C.M. (CCH) 1510, 1511 (1970), aff'd, 73-1 U.S.T.C.  (CCH) p 9205 (9th Cir. 1972);   Crawford v. Commissioner, 28 T.C.M.  (CCH) 909, 910-11 (1969);  see also 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6214(b) (\"The Tax Court in redetermining a deficiency of income tax for any taxable year ... shall consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other years or calendar quarters as may be necessary correctly to redetermine the amount of such deficiency, but in so doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for any other year or calendar quarter has been overpaid or underpaid.\").  Therefore, the Tax Court had no jurisdiction to determine that the IRS owed Niazmand a refund for pre-1979 years since the IRS had not determined that Niazmand's income tax was deficient in those years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if Niazmand had paid income tax in 1979, a year for which the IRS originally asserted a deficiency, then it might have been important to determine the exact amount of Niazmand's loss in that year in order to determine his taxable income and the extent of his alleged overpayment of taxes.  But Niazmand did not pay income tax in 1979, and so he could not have overpaid his taxes in that year, and the Tax Court correctly found that it had no need to determine the precise amount of Niazmand's losses.  Furthermore, the IRS had conceded that there was no deficiency in 1979, Niazmand had stipulated to the zero deficiency for that year, and the Tax Court had accepted the parties' stipulation.  Accordingly, the Tax Court's determination that Niazmand owed no income tax vindicated Niazmand fully with respect to his tax position in 1979, and its determination would not have been further aided by fixing the precise amount of the 1979 operating loss.  At trial, Niazmand suggested that calculating the operating loss was important because the amount of the loss could affect his tax treatment in future tax years.  The court's refusal to do so under the circumstances was completely appropriate.  Had the court fixed the amount of the operating loss, its determination would not have affected issues then before the court, but would essentially have been an \"advisory opinion declarative of the deduction petitioner may be able to use in some future years.\"   See LTV Corporation v.
