William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Howard, Circuit Judge,\n                    Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                 and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Joseph D.

On September 10, 1998,\n\nAndra Kelly (\"Andra\"), the chairman of the board of Appellee\n\nMcLaughlin Research Corporation (\"MRC\"), fired Appellants Harold J.\n\nMaturi (\"Harold\") and Henry G. Maturi (\"Henry\"), who had been MRC's\n\npresident    and   vice-president,      respectively,   since   1991.\n\nThereafter, Harold and Henry (collectively, \"Appellants\") filed\n\nthis action against MRC in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island.   In their complaint, Appellants asserted\n\na claim under the whistle-blower provision of the False Claims Act\n\n(\"FCA\"), 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h), as well as a claim under the Rhode\n\nIsland Whistle-Blowers' Protection Act (\"RIWPA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws §\n\n28-50-1 et seq.      The FCA and RIWPA claims were premised on\n\nAppellants' belief that they were wrongfully fired for, among other\n\nthings, complaining about the allegedly fraudulent receipt of dual\n\nsalaries and benefits by Conn Kelly (\"Conn\"), Andra's son and the\n\ndirector of marketing of MRC.      Following the close of discovery,\n\nMRC filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court\n\nallowed.    Appellants now seek review of the dismissal of their\n\nclaims as they relate to Conn's allegedly fraudulent receipt of\n\ndual salaries and benefits.      We affirm.\n\n                            I.   Background\n\n            We recount the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nAppellants, the individuals opposing summary judgment. See McAdams\n\nv. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 391 F.3d 287, 290 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fA.         MRC and Related Businesses\n\n           MRC is a contractor that provides engineering services to\n\nthe government of the United States.       At all relevant times, MRC's\n\nprincipal shareholders were members of the McLaughlin family:\n\nAndra, the daughter of MRC's founder; Bruce and Douglas McLaughlin,\n\nAndra's   brothers;   and   Brandy    McLaughlin-Wall,   Andra's   niece.\n\nAndra's son, Conn, and another niece, Morgan McLaughlin, also held\n\nshares in MRC, although they held far fewer shares than the\n\naforementioned family members.1\n\n           Prior to Appellants' termination, the above individuals,\n\nwith the exception of Conn2 and the addition of Harold, comprised\n\nMRC's board of directors (the \"board\").3      Andra was chairman of the\n\nboard; Harold, in addition to being a board member, was MRC's\n\npresident and chief operating officer4; and Henry was the company's\n\n\n     1\n      It appears that Conn owns less than one percent of MRC's\nstock.\n     2\n      It is not clear whether Bruce McLaughlin was a member of the\nboard, but the issue has no relevance to this appeal.\n     3\n      Appellants, in their opening brief to this court, assert that\nConn was a member of MRC's board, but they do not include a\ncitation to the record to support their assertion.       The record\nindicates that Conn was the board's secretary and that he attended\nboard meetings only to take notes; it does not indicate that he was\na board member.\n     4\n      There is a dispute as to whether Harold was also MRC's chief\nexecutive officer (\"CEO\"); Appellants claim that Andra, not Harold,\nheld this position. Nevertheless, this dispute is not material,\nbecause, regardless of whether Harold was officially designated as\nMRC's CEO, it is clear from the record that he was responsible for\nthe daily management of the company.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fexecutive vice-president.      Henry reported to Harold, and Harold\n\nreported directly to Andra.\n\n          Besides MRC, the McLaughlin family owned and operated\n\nseveral other businesses.     One of those businesses was McLaughlin\n\nPartners (\"Partners\"), a company created to provide services (for\n\na fee) to the other McLaughlin businesses, including MRC.\n\n          As a government contractor, MRC had to follow a set\n\nprocedure in order to receive payment from the government.          Before\n\nthe beginning of each fiscal year, MRC had to submit a provisional\n\nbudget to the government.     The budget, which was based largely on\n\na projection of MRC's yearly expenses, would list the payments that\n\nMRC was to receive from the government during the year.          MRC could\n\nadjust the budget at any time over the course of the year if its\n\nactual expenses differed from its projections.          At the end of the\n\nyear, a final accounting would determine whether the government\n\nowed MRC money or vice versa.\n\n          From   1991   to   1998,    MRC's   annual   revenue   fell   from\n\napproximately $30 million to $12 million.5              As a result, MRC\n\nreduced its workforce by more than half.               Moreover, in 1998,\n\nAppellants' salaries were reduced by ten percent,6 and they were\n\n\n     5\n      Appellants contend that the decline in revenue was the result\nof a reduction in government spending and not their management.\nFurther, Appellants point out that, despite the decline in revenue,\nMRC remained profitable.\n     6\n      It appears that Andra's salary was also cut by ten percent.\nIn any event, Henry viewed the reduction in salary as an adverse\n\n                                     -4-\n\fnot awarded performance-related bonuses for the first time since\n\n1991. In his deposition, Harold testified that by 1998, \"there was\n\nan undertone of anxiety amongst all [MRC] employees, including\n\nmyself, . . . about the possibility of being laid off.\"7\n\nB.        Harold and Henry's Responsibilities\n\n          As president, Harold was responsible for the \"day-to-day\"\n\nmanagement, including the financial management, of MRC. Harold had\n\nultimate responsibility over the budget and its adjustment over the\n\ncourse of a given year.   In other words, Harold had authority over\n\ngovernment billings and payments.     In adjusting the budget, Harold\n\ncould make any expense unallowable, meaning that it would not be\n\ncharged to the government.      When Harold had a question about\n\nwhether an expense could be charged to the government, he sought\n\nthe advice of a government auditor from the Defense Contract\n\nAuditing Agency (\"DCAA\").\n\n          Harold was also responsible for reporting \"items of\n\nconcern\" to Andra and the board. He \"fulfilled that responsibility\n\n. . . by [regularly] sending memos to Andra.\"    Over the years, when\n\nHarold discovered what he thought might be a fraudulent practice or\n\na wrongful charge to the government, he reported it to Andra in a\n\nmemo.\n\n\n\naction against him.\n     7\n      Unless it is otherwise indicated, all quotations that appear\nin this section were taken from Harold's deposition testimony.\n\n                                -5-\n\f             Although     Harold    was    ultimately    responsible    for    the\n\nbudget, it was Henry who prepared the budget; Henry would submit a\n\ndraft budget to Harold for approval.              Henry, like Harold, had the\n\nauthority to revise the budget during a given year and make any\n\nexpense unallowable.        Henry felt that he had a duty to report any\n\nproblems he encountered to Harold, who would then report them to\n\nAndra and the board.        Indeed, in his deposition, Henry testified:\n\n\"[I]f somebody [in] the [McLaughlin] family were conducting fraud\n\n. . . [, m]y responsibility would be to discuss it with [Harold],\n\n. . . [and h]e would have to take it from . . . there.\"\n\nC.           Events Pertaining to the Litigation\n\n             In    June   1998,    MRC    hired   Conn   as   its   director   of\n\nmarketing.8       Before starting at MRC, Conn worked for Partners.             A\n\nshort time after Conn's arrival at MRC, Harold and Henry learned\n\nthat he had been collecting a salary and benefits from both MRC and\n\nPartners.9    Appellants then met with Conn on more than one occasion\n\n\n\n     8\n      Andra informed Harold that Conn was to be employed at MRC,\nbut it was Harold who assigned Conn to the position of director of\nmarketing. When Conn was hired, he had no business training or\nexperience.\n     9\n      The parties agree that Conn received dual salaries and\nbenefits and that Conn's Partners' salary and benefits were charged\nto the government. But, MRC insists that Conn's MRC salary and\nbenefits were not charged to the government at any point during\n1998 or in the final, end-of-the-year accounting and, thus, that\nhis receipt of dual salaries and benefits could not have resulted\nin a fraud on the government. For purposes of this opinion, we\nassume that Conn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits was\nfraudulent.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fto discuss the issue.         During one meeting, Harold informed Conn\n\nthat his actions were \"fraudulent\" and that he could be sent to\n\nprison.     Conn told Harold that the issue was \"[n]one of [his]\n\nbusiness.\"    Harold then threatened to discuss the issue with DCAA\n\nauditors.    In response, Conn allegedly said:           \"'If you go to DCAA,\n\nI'll have you fired' or 'you'll be fired.'\"              Conn never mentioned\n\nthe details of his conversations with Appellants to Andra.10\n\n            During     this    period,     Andra     hired      James     Waddell\n\n(\"Waddell\"),    a     management   consultant      and   her    son-in-law,    to\n\nevaluate MRC's senior management--Harold and Henry. As part of his\n\nevaluation,    Waddell     interviewed    a    number    of    MRC's    mid-level\n\nmanagers.      Conn    arranged    for   the   interviews      to   occur   while\n\nAppellants were on vacation.         In August 1998, Waddell submitted to\n\nAndra a report that was critical of Appellants' management style.11\n\n             On August 24, 1998, Harold drafted a letter to Andra\n\nconcerning the Conn issue.         It stated, in relevant part:\n\n             Recently it . . . has been brought to my\n             attention . . . that Conn has been receiving\n\n\n     10\n      According to the record, Conn told Andra that he had a heated\ndiscussion with Appellants but did not discuss the details of that\ndiscussion.\n     11\n      Appellants insist that Waddell was not qualified for the task\nfor which he was hired and that his interview notes did not support\nthe conclusions he reached in the report. Regardless of whether\nWaddell was qualified to evaluate Appellants' management style, his\ninterview notes certainly contain comments critical of Appellants.\nAnd, for purposes of this opinion, the information pertaining to\nAppellants that was communicated to Andra is significant; the\nveracity of that information is not.\n\n                               -7-\n\f            two salaries. . . . In that we are subject to\n            DCAA [a]udits there could be a potential\n            problem should [DCAA auditors] uncover this .\n            . . . In that I recognize that this could be\n            a potential problem . . . , I am first\n            bring[ing this] to your attention. I tried to\n            discuss this with Conn . . . , but he . . .\n            wouldn't recognize the problem. I am looking\n            to you . . . to help me resolve this\n            situation.\n\nAndra did not respond to the letter.     Neither Harold nor Henry took\n\nany further action with respect to the Conn issue while employed by\n\nMRC. And, they did not discuss the issue with the government until\n\nMay 31, 2000, almost two years after they were fired and subsequent\n\nto the initiation of this litigation.\n\n            On September 10, 1998, Andra met with Harold.           At the\n\nmeeting,   Andra   allegedly   said   that   she    felt   \"threatened\"   by\n\nHarold's letter of August 24, 1998 and referred to it as \"the last\n\nstraw.\"    She then terminated the employment of Harold and Henry.12\n\n            On December 17, 1999, Appellants initiated this action.\n\nIn their complaint, Appellants asserted claims against MRC under\n\nthe whistle-blower provisions of the FCA, 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h), and\n\nthe RIWPA, R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-50-1 et seq.           Appellants asserted\n\nthat they were fired for, inter alia, complaining about Conn's\n\nreceipt of dual salaries and benefits.             Following the close of\n\ndiscovery, MRC filed a motion for summary judgment, which was\n\n\n     12\n      The day before, Andra and Waddell had a conversation over the\ntelephone. Waddell's notes from the call state, \"Letter re Conn is\nfocal point.\" Although Appellants contend that Conn participated\nin the call, there is no support for this contention in the record.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fallowed. Appellants now appeal that ruling, but only as it relates\n\nto Conn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits.\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n            We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de\n\nnovo.     GTE Wireless, Inc. v. Cellexis Int'l, Inc., 341 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).      Summary judgment is appropriate only if the\n\nrecord reveals \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).     We may affirm a grant of\n\nsummary judgment on any ground supported by the record. See Geffon\n\nv. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nA.          False Claims Act Claim\n\n            The FCA prohibits the knowing submission of false or\n\nfraudulent claims13 to the federal government. 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a);\n\nsee United States ex rel. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp., 360\n\nF.3d 220, 224-25 (1st Cir. 2004).           The statute's \"'qui tam'\n\nprovisions[, see 31 U.S.C. § 3730,] authorize[] private individuals\n\nto sue on behalf of the federal government and were intended to aid\n\nthe government in discovering fraud and abuse by unleashing a posse\n\nof ad hoc deputies to uncover and prosecute frauds against the\n\n\n\n\n     13\n      A claim is defined as \"any request or demand . . . for money\nor property which is made . . . if the United States Government\nprovides [or will reimburse] any portion of the money or property\nwhich is requested or demanded.\" 31 U.S.C. § 3729(c).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fgovernment.\"    Karvelas, 360 F.3d at 224 (internal quotation marks\n\nand footnote omitted).\n\n          To encourage the filing of qui tam actions and protect\n\nwhistle-blowers--persons who expose false or fraudulent claims, the\n\nFCA imposes liability on employers who retaliate against employees\n\nwho pursue, investigate, or contribute to an action exposing fraud\n\nagainst the government.     See 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h).    The statute\n\nprovides, in relevant part:\n\n          Any employee who is discharged . . . or in any\n          . . . manner discriminated against in the\n          terms and conditions of employment by his or\n          her employer because of lawful acts done by\n          the employee on behalf of the employee or\n          others in furtherance of an action under this\n          section,    including    investigation    for,\n          initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in\n          an action filed or to be filed under this\n          section, shall be entitled to all relief\n          necessary to make the employee whole.\n\nId. Thus, to prevail on an FCA retaliation claim, a plaintiff must\n\nshow that:     he engaged in conduct protected under the FCA; the\n\nemployer knew that he was engaged in such conduct14; and the\n\nemployer discharged or discriminated against him because of his\n\nprotected conduct.15     Karvelas, 360 F.3d at 235.    An employee's\n\n\n     14\n      \"The requirement that employers have knowledge that an\nemployee is engaged in 'protected conduct' ensures that § 3730(h)\nsuits are only prosecuted where there has been actual retaliation.\"\nHutchins v. Wilentz, Goldman & Spitzer, 253 F.3d 176, 186 n.7 (3d\nCir. 2001).\n     15\n      If the plaintiff satisfies his burden, \"the burden shifts to\nthe employer to prove that the employee would have been terminated\nor subjected to other adverse action even if he or she had not\n\n                                 -10-\n\fconduct is protected where it involves \"acts done . . . in\n\nfurtherance of\" an FCA action.    31 U.S.C. § 3730(h).\n\n          Appellants cannot satisfy the above standard, and as a\n\nresult, their FCA claim was properly dismissed.     Even if we assume\n\nthat Appellants were engaged in protected conduct in connection\n\nwith the Conn issue, and we are skeptical that they were,16 the\n\nrecord does not establish that their superior at MRC knew that they\n\nwere engaged in such conduct.\n\n          Ordinarily, an employer is charged with knowledge that an\n\nemployee is engaged in protected conduct when the employer is put\n\non notice that the employee is taking action that reasonably could\n\nlead to an FCA case.   See Karvelas, 360 F.3d at 238.    But, a number\n\nof our sister circuits have held that where an employee oversees\n\ngovernment billings or payments as a part of his regular job\n\nresponsibilities, he must make it clear that his actions go beyond\n\nhis regular duties to establish that his employer was on notice\n\nthat he was engaged in protected conduct.        See Yuhasz v. Brush\n\n\n\nengaged in the protected conduct.\"      Karvelas, 360 F.3d at 235.\n     16\n      It does not appear that any of Appellants' actions in\nconnection with the Conn issue were undertaken \"in furtherance of\"\nan FCA action. 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h). Rather, it appears as though\nAppellants acted entirely in accordance with their employment\nduties when they investigated and pursued the Conn issue and that\nthey sought to resolve the issue in-house and without any thought\nof initiating an FCA action.      See Hutchins, 253 F.3d at 191\n(\"[W]here an employee's job duties involve investigating and\nreporting fraud, the employee's burden of proving he engaged in\n'protected conduct' . . . is heightened.\").\n\n                                 -11-\n\fWellman, Inc., 341 F.3d 559, 567-68 (6th Cir. 2003); Hutchins, 253\n\nF.3d at 191; Eberhardt v. Integrated Design & Constr., Inc., 167\n\nF.3d 861, 868 (4th Cir. 1999); United States ex rel. Ramseyer v.\n\nCentury Healthcare Corp., 90 F.3d 1514, 1523 (10th Cir. 1996);\n\nRobertson v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., 32 F.3d 948, 951-52\n\n(5th Cir. 1994).     Placing a heightened burden on such employees\n\nensures that employers will be disciplined for taking adverse\n\naction against their employees only when they are aware that the\n\nemployees were engaged in protected conduct, that is, only when a\n\nnexus   exists   between   the   adverse   employment   action   and   the\n\nprotected conduct.    See Ramseyer, 90 F.3d at 1523 n.7 (Employees\n\nsubject to the heightened burden \"must make clear their intentions\n\nof bringing or assisting in an FCA action in order to overcome the\n\npresumption that they are merely acting in accordance with their\n\nemployment obligations.\").\n\n           We agree that where an employee's job responsibilities\n\ninvolve overseeing government billings or payments, his burden of\n\nproving that his employer was on notice that he was engaged in\n\nprotected conduct should be heightened.       Yet, such an employee can\n\nput his employer on notice by \"any action which . . . [, regardless\n\nof his job duties,] would put the employer on notice that [FCA]\n\nlitigation is a reasonable possibility.\"        Eberhardt, 167 F.3d at\n\n868.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f          Here, both Harold and Henry had authority over government\n\nbillings and payments,17 and consequently, they have to establish\n\nthat, despite their job duties, Andra was on notice that FCA\n\nlitigation was a reasonable possibility when she fired them.\n\nNeither Appellant can meet this heightened burden.\n\n          1.     Harold\n\n          Harold's August 24, 1998 letter to Andra was his only\n\ncommunication with his superior18 about Conn's receipt of dual\n\nsalaries and benefits. In the letter, Harold raised the Conn issue\n\nas a \"potential problem\" if discovered by DCAA auditors and asked\n\nAndra to help him \"resolve th[e] situation.\" Harold did not accuse\n\nAndra or MRC of engaging in fraudulent behavior or express a desire\n\nto involve any other individual or entity in the Conn issue.   See\n\nid. (stating that an employee whose job duties include overseeing\n\ngovernment billings or payments can put his employer on notice by\n\n\"characterizing the employer's conduct as illegal or fraudulent or\n\nrecommending that legal counsel become involved\").       Given the\n\n\n\n     17\n      Appellants may have delegated tasks associated with\ngovernment billings and payments to other MRC employees, but that\ndoes not change the fact that they were still responsible for\noverseeing such billings and payments.\n     18\n      Harold insists that Conn was also his superior. There is no\nquestion that Harold felt that he needed to give Conn and those at\nMRC related to Andra special consideration because of their\nrelationship with Andra and that Conn, in particular, did not\nalways act towards Harold in a way in which a typical subordinate\nwould ordinarily act towards a superior. Still, the record does\nnot support the view that Conn was Harold's superior.\n\n                               -13-\n\fcontent of the letter, the fact that Harold oversaw government\n\nbillings, and that he had raised similar issues in letters to Andra\n\nin the past, the letter could not reasonably have put Andra on\n\nnotice that FCA litigation was a realistic possibility.19\n\n            Moreover, despite Harold's insistence to the contrary, it\n\nis of no consequence that Harold told Conn that Conn's actions were\n\nfraudulent; Harold told Conn that he intended to discuss Conn's\n\nreceipt of dual salaries and benefits with DCAA auditors; and Conn\n\ntold Harold that he would be fired if he did so.   First, the record\n\nshows that Conn was subordinate to Harold; Conn was not Harold’s\n\nsuperior.    Second, it was Andra, and not Conn, who fired Harold.\n\nAnd, third, Conn never mentioned the details of his confrontations\n\nwith Harold to Andra.     Harold's interactions with Conn could not\n\n\n\n\n     19\n      Appellants claim that immediately before their firing, Andra\nreferred to the letter as a \"threat\" and \"the last straw.\" But, it\nwould not be reasonable (indeed, it would be overly speculative) to\ninterpret these statements (even assuming they were made in the\nfirst place) as proof that Andra viewed the letter as a precursor\nto FCA litigation.     Given the content of the letter, it is\nreasonable to assume that Andra characterized it as a threat\nbecause it could have jeopardized her control over MRC--it could\nhave led MRC's other board members to question her decision to hire\nConn and, quite possibly, her overall leadership of the company,\nparticularly in light of the fact that MRC's revenues had been on\nthe decline. And, Andra's \"last straw\" comment does not appear\nparticularly retaliatory when one considers that she viewed the\nletter as raising a non-issue; a report had recently been compiled\nthat was critical of Appellants' management style; a short time\nbefore, Appellants' salaries had been reduced and they had not been\nawarded performance-related bonuses; and MRC's revenues (and\nworkforce) had been declining for a number of years.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fhave put Andra, his superior, on notice that FCA litigation was a\n\ndistinct possibility.20\n\n          2.     Henry\n\n          Turning now to Henry, there is nothing in the record\n\nindicating that Andra was or should have been on notice of Henry's\n\nactions in connection with the Conn issue.   Henry never discussed\n\nwith Andra his concerns with respect to Conn.21    In fact, at his\n\ndeposition, Henry stated that he would report problems that he\n\nencountered to Harold and that Harold would \"take it from . . .\n\nthere.\"   And, there was nothing in Harold's sole communication to\n\nAndra about the Conn issue that would have put Andra on notice that\n\nthere was a realistic possibility of FCA litigation, much less FCA\n\nlitigation initiated by Henry.\n\nB.         Rhode Island Whistle-Blowers' Protection Act Claim\n\n          Having determined that the district court did not err in\n\ndismissing Appellants' federal whistle-blower claim, we now address\n\nwhether it erred in dismissing their state law claim.   In order to\n\n\n\n     20\n      We note that, given the factual circumstances of this case,\na threat of disclosing the Conn issue to DCAA auditors, even if\ncommunicated to Andra, would not have been sufficient to satisfy\nthe notice obligation. Whenever Harold was unsure of whether an\nexpense could be properly charged to the government, he consulted\nDCAA auditors. Thus, threatening to disclose the Conn issue to\nDCAA auditors is not akin to threatening, for example, to disclose\nthe issue to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or file a whistle-\nblower action.\n     21\n      Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Conn\ncommunicated Henry's concerns to Andra.\n\n                                 -15-\n\frecover under the RIWPA, a plaintiff must \"show by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that he . . . or a person acting on his . . .\n\nbehalf was about to report to a public body . . . a violation,\n\nwhich the employee knew or reasonably believed had occurred or was\n\nabout to occur, of a [state or federal] law.\"     R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-\n\n50-4(d).    Appellants' state law claim must fail, because neither\n\nHarold nor Henry was \"about to report\" Conn's receipt of dual\n\nsalaries and benefits to \"a public body.\"       Id.   Henry was content\n\nto let Harold handle the Conn issue, and in the letter of August\n\n24, 1998, Harold made it clear that he hoped that he and Andra\n\nwould be able to handle the issue in-house.22    We note that the fact\n\nthat Appellants did not report the issue to the government until\n\nMay 31, 2000, almost two years after their firing, goes against any\n\nargument that they were \"about to report\" it to the government in\n\nSeptember 1998.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     22\n      Although the DCAA arguably constitutes \"a public body\" under\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 28-50-2(4) (\"'Public body' means . . . (vii) [a]ny\nfederal agency.\"), and Harold told Conn that he intended to discuss\nConn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits with DCAA auditors,\nHarold's subsequent letter establishes that he was not \"about to\nreport\" the Conn issue to the DCAA. Therefore, we need not address\nwhether, under the facts of this case, the DCAA constitutes \"a\npublic body.\" Cf. supra note 20.\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

Thereafter, Harold and Henry (collectively, \"Appellants\") filed this action against MRC in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. In their complaint, Appellants asserted a claim under the whistle-blower provision of the False Claims Act (\"FCA\"), 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h), as well as a claim under the Rhode Island Whistle-Blowers' Protection Act (\"RIWPA\"), R.I.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts in the light most favorable to Appellants, the individuals opposing summary judgment. <i>See McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 391 F.3d 287, 290 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>MRC and Related Businesses</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MRC is a contractor that provides engineering services to the government of the United States. At all relevant times, MRC's principal shareholders were members of the McLaughlin family: Andra, the daughter of MRC's founder; Bruce and Douglas McLaughlin, Andra's brothers; and Brandy McLaughlin-Wall, Andra's niece. Andra's son, Conn, and another niece, Morgan McLaughlin, also held shares in MRC, although they held far fewer shares than the aforementioned family members.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to Appellants' termination, the above individuals, with the exception of Conn<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the addition of Harold, comprised MRC's board of directors (the \"board\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Andra was chairman of the board; Harold, in addition to being a board member, was MRC's president and chief operating officer<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>; and Henry was the company's executive vice-president. Henry reported to Harold, and Harold reported directly to Andra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides MRC, the McLaughlin family owned and operated several other businesses. One of those businesses was McLaughlin Partners (\"Partners\"), a company created to provide services (for a fee) to the other McLaughlin businesses, including MRC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a government contractor, MRC had to follow a set procedure in order to receive payment from the government. Before the beginning of each fiscal year, MRC had to submit a provisional budget to the government. The budget, which was based largely on a projection of MRC's yearly expenses, would list the payments that MRC was to receive from the government during the year. MRC could adjust the budget at any time over the course of the year if its actual expenses differed from its projections. At the end of the year, a final accounting would determine whether the government owed MRC money or vice versa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1991 to 1998, MRC's annual revenue fell from approximately $30 million to $12 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As a result, MRC reduced its workforce by more than half. Moreover, in 1998, Appellants' salaries were reduced by ten percent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and they were not awarded performance-related bonuses for the first time since 1991. In his deposition, Harold testified that by 1998, \"there was an undertone of anxiety amongst all [MRC] employees, including myself, ... about the possibility of being laid off.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Harold and Henry's Responsibilities</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As president, Harold was responsible for the \"day-to-day\" management, including the financial management, of MRC. Harold had ultimate responsibility over the budget and its adjustment over the course of a given year. In other words, Harold had authority over government billings and payments. In adjusting the budget, Harold could make any expense unallowable, meaning that it would not be charged to the government. When Harold had a question about whether an expense could be charged to the government, he sought the advice of a government auditor from the Defense Contract Auditing Agency (\"DCAA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harold was also responsible for reporting \"items of concern\" to Andra and the board. He \"fulfilled that responsibility... by [regularly] sending memos to Andra.\" Over the years, when Harold discovered what he thought might be a fraudulent practice or a wrongful charge to the government, he reported it to Andra in a memo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Harold was ultimately responsible for the budget, it was Henry who prepared the budget; Henry would submit a draft budget to Harold for approval. Henry, like Harold, had the authority to revise the budget during a given year and make any expense unallowable. Henry felt that he had a duty to report any problems he encountered to Harold, who would then report them to Andra and the board. Indeed, in his deposition, Henry testified: \"[I]f somebody [in] the [McLaughlin] family were conducting fraud ... [, m]y responsibility would be to discuss it with [Harold], ... [and h]e would have to take it from ... there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Events Pertaining to the Litigation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1998, MRC hired Conn as its director of marketing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Before starting at MRC, Conn worked for Partners. A short time after Conn's arrival at MRC, Harold and Henry learned that he had been collecting a salary and benefits from both MRC and Partners.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Appellants then met with Conn on more than one occasion to discuss the issue. During one meeting, Harold informed Conn that his actions were \"fraudulent\" and that he could be sent to prison. Conn told Harold that the issue was \"[n]one of [his] business.\" Harold then threatened to discuss the issue with DCAA auditors. In response, Conn allegedly said: \"`If you go to DCAA, I'll have you fired' or `you'll be fired.'\" Conn never mentioned the details of his conversations with Appellants to Andra.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period, Andra hired James Waddell (\"Waddell\"), a management consultant and her son-in-law, to evaluate MRC's senior management&#8212;Harold and Henry. As part of his evaluation, Waddell interviewed a number of MRC's mid-level managers. Conn arranged for the interviews to occur while Appellants were on vacation. In August 1998, Waddell submitted to Andra a report that was critical of Appellants' management style.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 24, 1998, Harold drafted a letter to Andra concerning the Conn issue. It stated, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recently it ... has been brought to my attention ... that Conn has been receiving two salaries.... In that we are subject to DCAA [a]udits there could be a potential problem should [DCAA auditors] uncover this .... In that I recognize that this could be a potential problem..., I am first bring[ing this] to your attention. I tried to discuss this with Conn ..., but he ... wouldn't recognize the problem. I am looking to you... to help me resolve this situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andra did not respond to the letter. Neither Harold nor Henry took any further action with respect to the Conn issue while employed by MRC. And, they did not discuss the issue with the government until May 31, 2000, almost two years after they were fired and subsequent to the initiation of this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1998, Andra met with Harold. At the meeting, Andra allegedly said that she felt \"threatened\" by Harold's letter of August 24, 1998 and referred to it as \"the last straw.\" She then terminated the employment of Harold and Henry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1999, Appellants initiated this action. In their complaint, Appellants asserted claims against MRC under the whistle-blower provisions of the FCA, 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h), and the RIWPA, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 28-50-1 <i>et seq.</i> Appellants asserted that they were fired for, <i>inter alia,</i> complaining about Conn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits. Following the close of discovery, MRC filed a motion for summary judgment, which was allowed. Appellants now appeal that ruling, but only as it relates to Conn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment <i>de novo. GTE Wireless, Inc. v. Cellexis Int'l, Inc.,</i> 341 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate only if the record reveals \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record. <i>See Geffon v.

The statute's \"`qui tam' provisions[, <i>see</i> 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730,] authorize[] private individuals to sue on behalf of the federal government and were intended to aid the government in discovering fraud and abuse by unleashing a posse of <i>ad hoc</i> deputies to uncover and prosecute frauds against the government.\" <i>Karvelas,</i> 360 F.3d at 224 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To encourage the filing of qui tam actions and protect whistle-blowers&#8212; persons who expose false or fraudulent claims, the FCA imposes liability on employers who retaliate against employees who pursue, investigate, or contribute to an action exposing fraud against the government. <i>See</i> 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h). The statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any employee who is discharged ... or in any ... manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Thus, to prevail on an FCA retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that: he engaged in conduct protected under the FCA; the employer knew that he was engaged in such conduct<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>; and the employer discharged or discriminated against him because of his protected conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>Karvelas,</i> 360 F.3d at 235.

Even if we assume that Appellants were engaged in protected conduct in connection with the Conn issue, and we are skeptical that they were,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> the record does not establish that their superior at MRC knew that they were engaged in such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, an employer is charged with knowledge that an employee is engaged in protected conduct when the employer is put on notice that the employee is taking action that reasonably could lead to an FCA case. <i>See Karvelas,</i> 360 F.3d at 238. But, a number of our sister circuits have held that where an employee oversees government billings or payments as a part of his regular job responsibilities, he must make it clear that his actions go beyond his regular duties to establish that his employer was on notice that he was engaged in protected conduct. <i>See Yuhasz v. Brush Wellman, Inc.,</i> 341 F.3d 559, 567-68 (6th Cir.2003); <i>Hutchins,</i> 253 F.3d at 191; <i>Eberhardt v. Integrated Design &amp; Constr., Inc.,</i> 167 F.3d 861, 868 (4th Cir. 1999); <i>United States ex rel. Ramseyer v. Century Healthcare Corp.,</i> 90 F.3d 1514, 1523 (10th Cir.1996); <i>Robertson v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.,</i> 32 F.3d 948, 951-52 (5th Cir.1994). Placing a heightened burden on such employees ensures that employers will be disciplined for taking adverse action against their employees only when they are aware that the employees were engaged in protected conduct, that is, only when a nexus exists between the adverse employment action and the protected conduct. <i>See Ramseyer,</i> 90 F.3d at 1523 n. 7 (Employees subject to the heightened burden \"must make clear their intentions of bringing or assisting in an FCA action in order to overcome the presumption that they are merely acting in accordance with their employment obligations.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that where an employee's job responsibilities involve overseeing government billings or payments, his burden of proving that his employer was on notice that he was engaged in protected conduct should be heightened. Yet, such an employee can put his employer on notice by \"any action which ... [, regardless of his job duties,] would put the employer on notice that [FCA] litigation is a reasonable possibility.\" <i>Eberhardt,</i> 167 F.3d at 868.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, both Harold and Henry had authority over government billings and payments,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> and consequently, they have to establish that, despite their job duties, Andra was on notice that FCA litigation was a reasonable possibility when she fired them. Neither Appellant can meet this heightened burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Harold</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harold's August 24, 1998 letter to Andra was his only communication with his superior<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> about Conn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits. In the letter, Harold raised the Conn issue as a \"potential problem\" if discovered by DCAA auditors and asked Andra to help him \"resolve th[e] situation.\" Harold did not accuse Andra or MRC of engaging in fraudulent behavior or express a desire to involve any other individual or entity in the Conn issue. <i>See id.</i> (stating that an employee whose job duties include overseeing government billings or payments can put his employer on notice by \"characterizing the employer's conduct as illegal or fraudulent or recommending that legal counsel become involved\"). Given the content of the letter, the fact that Harold oversaw government billings, and that he had raised similar issues in letters to Andra in the past, the letter could not reasonably have put Andra on notice that FCA litigation was a realistic possibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, despite Harold's insistence to the contrary, it is of no consequence that Harold told Conn that Conn's actions were fraudulent; Harold told Conn that he intended to discuss Conn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits with DCAA auditors; and Conn told Harold that he would be fired if he did so. First, the record shows that Conn was subordinate to Harold; Conn was not Harold's superior. Second, it was Andra, and not Conn, who fired Harold. And, third, Conn never mentioned the details of his confrontations with Harold to Andra.

There is no question that Harold felt that he needed to give Conn and those at MRC related to Andra special consideration because of their relationship with Andra and that Conn, in particular, did not always act towards Harold in a way in which a typical subordinate would ordinarily act towards a superior. Still, the record does not support the view that Conn was Harold's superior</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Appellants claim that immediately before their firing, Andra referred to the letter as a \"threat\" and \"the last straw.\" But, it would not be reasonable (indeed, it would be overly speculative) to interpret these statements (even assuming they were made in the first place) as proof that Andra viewed the letter as a precursor to FCA litigation. Given the content of the letter, it is reasonable to assume that Andra characterized it as a threat because it could have jeopardized her control over MRC&#8212;it could have led MRC's other board members to question her decision to hire Conn and, quite possibly, her overall leadership of the company, particularly in light of the fact that MRC's revenues had been on the decline. And, Andra's \"last straw\" comment does not appear particularly retaliatory when one considers that she viewed the letter as raising a non-issue; a report had recently been compiled that was critical of Appellants' management style; a short time before, Appellants' salaries had been reduced and they had not been awarded performance-related bonuses; and MRC's revenues (and workforce) had been declining for a number of years</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> We note that, given the factual circumstances of this case, a threat of disclosing the Conn issue to DCAA auditors, even if communicated to Andra, would not have been sufficient to satisfy the notice obligation. Whenever Harold was unsure of whether an expense could be properly charged to the government, he consulted DCAA auditors. Thus, threatening to disclose the Conn issue to DCAA auditors is not akin to threatening, for example, to disclose the issue to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or file a whistle-blower action</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Conn communicated Henry's concerns to Andra</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Although the DCAA arguably constitutes \"a public body\" under R.I.

At all relevant times, MRC's principal shareholders were members of the McLaughlin family: Andra, the daughter of MRC's founder; Bruce and Douglas McLaughlin, Andra's brothers; and Brandy McLaughlin-Wall, Andra's niece. Andra's son, Conn, and another niece, Morgan McLaughlin, also held shares in MRC, although they held far fewer shares than the aforementioned family members.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to Appellants' termination, the above individuals, with the exception of Conn<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the addition of Harold, comprised MRC's board of directors (the \"board\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Andra was chairman of the board; Harold, in addition to being a board member, was MRC's president and chief operating officer<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>; and Henry was the company's executive vice-president. Henry reported to Harold, and Harold reported directly to Andra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides MRC, the McLaughlin family owned and operated several other businesses. One of those businesses was McLaughlin Partners (\"Partners\"), a company created to provide services (for a fee) to the other McLaughlin businesses, including MRC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a government contractor, MRC had to follow a set procedure in order to receive payment from the government. Before the beginning of each fiscal year, MRC had to submit a provisional budget to the government. The budget, which was based largely on a projection of MRC's yearly expenses, would list the payments that MRC was to receive from the government during the year. MRC could adjust the budget at any time over the course of the year if its actual expenses differed from its projections. At the end of the year, a final accounting would determine whether the government owed MRC money or vice versa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1991 to 1998, MRC's annual revenue fell from approximately $30 million to $12 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As a result, MRC reduced its workforce by more than half. Moreover, in 1998, Appellants' salaries were reduced by ten percent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and they were not awarded performance-related bonuses for the first time since 1991. In his deposition, Harold testified that by 1998, \"there was an undertone of anxiety amongst all [MRC] employees, including myself, ... about the possibility of being laid off.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Harold and Henry's Responsibilities</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As president, Harold was responsible for the \"day-to-day\" management, including the financial management, of MRC. Harold had ultimate responsibility over the budget and its adjustment over the course of a given year. In other words, Harold had authority over government billings and payments. In adjusting the budget, Harold could make any expense unallowable, meaning that it would not be charged to the government. When Harold had a question about whether an expense could be charged to the government, he sought the advice of a government auditor from the Defense Contract Auditing Agency (\"DCAA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harold was also responsible for reporting \"items of concern\" to Andra and the board. He \"fulfilled that responsibility... by [regularly] sending memos to Andra.\" Over the years, when Harold discovered what he thought might be a fraudulent practice or a wrongful charge to the government, he reported it to Andra in a memo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Harold was ultimately responsible for the budget, it was Henry who prepared the budget; Henry would submit a draft budget to Harold for approval. Henry, like Harold, had the authority to revise the budget during a given year and make any expense unallowable. Henry felt that he had a duty to report any problems he encountered to Harold, who would then report them to Andra and the board. Indeed, in his deposition, Henry testified: \"[I]f somebody [in] the [McLaughlin] family were conducting fraud ... [, m]y responsibility would be to discuss it with [Harold], ... [and h]e would have to take it from ... there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Events Pertaining to the Litigation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1998, MRC hired Conn as its director of marketing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Before starting at MRC, Conn worked for Partners. A short time after Conn's arrival at MRC, Harold and Henry learned that he had been collecting a salary and benefits from both MRC and Partners.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Appellants then met with Conn on more than one occasion to discuss the issue. During one meeting, Harold informed Conn that his actions were \"fraudulent\" and that he could be sent to prison. Conn told Harold that the issue was \"[n]one of [his] business.\" Harold then threatened to discuss the issue with DCAA auditors. In response, Conn allegedly said: \"`If you go to DCAA, I'll have you fired' or `you'll be fired.'\" Conn never mentioned the details of his conversations with Appellants to Andra.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period, Andra hired James Waddell (\"Waddell\"), a management consultant and her son-in-law, to evaluate MRC's senior management&#8212;Harold and Henry. As part of his evaluation, Waddell interviewed a number of MRC's mid-level managers. Conn arranged for the interviews to occur while Appellants were on vacation. In August 1998, Waddell submitted to Andra a report that was critical of Appellants' management style.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 24, 1998, Harold drafted a letter to Andra concerning the Conn issue. It stated, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recently it ... has been brought to my attention ... that Conn has been receiving two salaries.... In that we are subject to DCAA [a]udits there could be a potential problem should [DCAA auditors] uncover this .... In that I recognize that this could be a potential problem..., I am first bring[ing this] to your attention. I tried to discuss this with Conn ..., but he ... wouldn't recognize the problem. I am looking to you... to help me resolve this situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andra did not respond to the letter. Neither Harold nor Henry took any further action with respect to the Conn issue while employed by MRC. And, they did not discuss the issue with the government until May 31, 2000, almost two years after they were fired and subsequent to the initiation of this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1998, Andra met with Harold. At the meeting, Andra allegedly said that she felt \"threatened\" by Harold's letter of August 24, 1998 and referred to it as \"the last straw.\" She then terminated the employment of Harold and Henry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1999, Appellants initiated this action. In their complaint, Appellants asserted claims against MRC under the whistle-blower provisions of the FCA, 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h), and the RIWPA, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 28-50-1 <i>et seq.</i> Appellants asserted that they were fired for, <i>inter alia,</i> complaining about Conn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits.

But, a number of our sister circuits have held that where an employee oversees government billings or payments as a part of his regular job responsibilities, he must make it clear that his actions go beyond his regular duties to establish that his employer was on notice that he was engaged in protected conduct. <i>See Yuhasz v.

Placing a heightened burden on such employees ensures that employers will be disciplined for taking adverse action against their employees only when they are aware that the employees were engaged in protected conduct, that is, only when a nexus exists between the adverse employment action and the protected conduct. <i>See Ramseyer,</i> 90 F.3d at 1523 n. 7 (Employees subject to the heightened burden \"must make clear their intentions of bringing or assisting in an FCA action in order to overcome the presumption that they are merely acting in accordance with their employment obligations.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that where an employee's job responsibilities involve overseeing government billings or payments, his burden of proving that his employer was on notice that he was engaged in protected conduct should be heightened. Yet, such an employee can put his employer on notice by \"any action which ...

Neither Appellant can meet this heightened burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Harold</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harold's August 24, 1998 letter to Andra was his only communication with his superior<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> about Conn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits. In the letter, Harold raised the Conn issue as a \"potential problem\" if discovered by DCAA auditors and asked Andra to help him \"resolve th[e] situation.\" Harold did not accuse Andra or MRC of engaging in fraudulent behavior or express a desire to involve any other individual or entity in the Conn issue. <i>See id.</i> (stating that an employee whose job duties include overseeing government billings or payments can put his employer on notice by \"characterizing the employer's conduct as illegal or fraudulent or recommending that legal counsel become involved\"). Given the content of the letter, the fact that Harold oversaw government billings, and that he had raised similar issues in letters to Andra in the past, the letter could not reasonably have put Andra on notice that FCA litigation was a realistic possibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, despite Harold's insistence to the contrary, it is of no consequence that Harold told Conn that Conn's actions were fraudulent; Harold told Conn that he intended to discuss Conn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits with DCAA auditors; and Conn told Harold that he would be fired if he did so. First, the record shows that Conn was subordinate to Harold; Conn was not Harold's superior. Second, it was Andra, and not Conn, who fired Harold. And, third, Conn never mentioned the details of his confrontations with Harold to Andra. Harold's interactions with Conn could not have put Andra, his superior, on notice that FCA litigation was a distinct possibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Henry</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning now to Henry, there is nothing in the record indicating that Andra was or should have been on notice of Henry's actions in connection with the Conn issue. Henry never discussed with Andra his concerns with respect to Conn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> In fact, at his deposition, Henry stated that he would report problems that he encountered to Harold and that Harold would \"take it from ... there.\" And, there was nothing in Harold's sole communication to Andra about the Conn issue that would have put Andra on notice that there was a realistic possibility of FCA litigation, much less FCA litigation initiated by Henry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Rhode Island Whistle-Blowers' Protection Act Claim</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the district court did not err in dismissing Appellants' federal whistle-blower claim, we now address whether it erred in dismissing their state law claim.

Gen. Laws &#167; 28-50-4(d). Appellants' state law claim must fail, because neither Harold nor Henry was \"about to report\" Conn's receipt of dual salaries and benefits to \"a public body.\" <i>Id.</i> Henry was content to let Harold handle the Conn issue, and in the letter of August 24, 1998, Harold made it clear that he hoped that he and Andra would be able to handle the issue in-house.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> We note that the fact that Appellants did not report the issue to the government until May 31, 2000, almost two years after their firing, goes against any argument that they were \"about to report\" it to the government in September 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> It appears that Conn owns less than one percent of MRC's stock</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It is not clear whether Bruce McLaughlin was a member of the board, but the issue has no relevance to this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Appellants, in their opening brief to this court, assert that Conn was a member of MRC's board, but they do not include a citation to the record to support their assertion.

There is no question that Harold felt that he needed to give Conn and those at MRC related to Andra special consideration because of their relationship with Andra and that Conn, in particular, did not always act towards Harold in a way in which a typical subordinate would ordinarily act towards a superior. Still, the record does not support the view that Conn was Harold's superior</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Appellants claim that immediately before their firing, Andra referred to the letter as a \"threat\" and \"the last straw.\" But, it would not be reasonable (indeed, it would be overly speculative) to interpret these statements (even assuming they were made in the first place) as proof that Andra viewed the letter as a precursor to FCA litigation. Given the content of the letter, it is reasonable to assume that Andra characterized it as a threat because it could have jeopardized her control over MRC&#8212;it could have led MRC's other board members to question her decision to hire Conn and, quite possibly, her overall leadership of the company, particularly in light of the fact that MRC's revenues had been on the decline. And, Andra's \"last straw\" comment does not appear particularly retaliatory when one considers that she viewed the letter as raising a non-issue; a report had recently been compiled that was critical of Appellants' management style; a short time before, Appellants' salaries had been reduced and they had not been awarded performance-related bonuses; and MRC's revenues (and workforce) had been declining for a number of years</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> We note that, given the factual circumstances of this case, a threat of disclosing the Conn issue to DCAA auditors, even if communicated to Andra, would not have been sufficient to satisfy the notice obligation. Whenever Harold was unsure of whether an expense could be properly charged to the government, he consulted DCAA auditors.
