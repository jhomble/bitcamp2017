Domingo Diaz,  a  retired\n                              \n\nseaman,   brought  this   lawsuit   against  the   Seafarers\n\nInternational Union  and the Union's Pension Plan.   He says\n\nthat the  Plan should have  provided him a pension  of about\n\n$450  per month,  rather than  about  $200 per  month.   The\n\nPlan's  failure  to do  so,  in Diaz's  view,  represents an\n\nerroneous application of  the Plan's own pension-calculation\n\nrules  and thereby  violates  federal  law.    See  Employee\n                                                  \n\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974  (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.  \n\n1104(a)(1)(D)  (\"[Plan  trustees]  shall  discharge  [their]\n\nduties  .  .   .  in  accordance  with   the  documents  and\n\ninstruments  governing the  plan .  . .  .\").   The district\n\ncourt found  that the  Plan, through  its trustees,  did not\n\nimproperly apply the Plan's rules.   We agree, and we affirm\n\nthe district court's judgment.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          A. Basic Facts.   The following key facts  are not\n                        \n\ncontested:\n\n          1.   From  1943 to 1960 Diaz worked on ships whose\n               employees were  represented by  the Seafarers\n               International  Union  (SIU).     During  that\n               period, the SIU had no pension plan.\n\n          2.   In  1960 Diaz  quit.   Soon  after, he  began\n               working   on  ships   whose  employees   were\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\n               represented  by the  National Maritime  Union\n               (NMU).\n\n          3.   In 1961 the  SIU developed a pension  plan --\n               the  Seafarers   Pension  Plan   --  covering\n               seafarers who work on SIU-represented ships.\n\n          4.   In  1968  Diaz,  then  still  working  on NMU\n               ships, was  injured and stopped working  as a\n               seaman altogether.\n\n          5.   In 1975  Diaz recovered  from his injury  and\n               began to work again as a seaman, this time on\n               SIU ships.\n\n          6.   In 1988 Diaz retired, at age 65, having spent\n               the previous 13 years on SIU ships.\n\n          B.  The  Seafarers  Pension Plan.    The Seafarers\n                                          \n\nPension Plan provides pensions based upon time worked on SIU\n\nships,  but not  on  other  ships.   It  normally permits  a\n\nseafarer  to include, in the pension level calculation, time\n\nthat  he  worked  even  before  the  plan  first  came  into\n\nexistence  in  1961   --  even  though  employers   did  not\n\ncontribute before 1961  and the relevant pension  funds must\n\ntherefore come  from contributions  (and related  investment\n\nearnings) made in  respect to work  performed later, and  by\n\nothers.\n\n          Despite the  ordinary practice  of crediting  pre-\n\n1961 work,  the trustees  gave Diaz credit  only for  the 13\n\nyears he  worked on  SIU ships after  he recovered  from his\n\ninjury  in 1975 and  returned to SIU work.   They denied him\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\ncredit  for the 17  years he worked  on SIU  ships before he\n\nleft  SIU employment  in 1961  (and before  the SIU  had any\n\npension plan)  because they  concluded that,  in respect  to\n\nthat  work, Diaz  suffered a  \"break in  service\" under  the\n\nplan's \"break in service\" rule.  The rule prohibits counting\n\nwork prior  to a \"break  in service,\" defined as  failure to\n\nperform  90  or more  days  of SIU  work  in  each of  three\n\nconsecutive calendar years between 1968 and 1975 (when ERISA\n\ntook effect).  The rule states specifically:\n\n          If  during the  period  from January  1,\n          1968 to December  31, 1975, an  employee\n          received credit for less than 90 days of\n          Service in each of three (3) consecutive\n          calendar years, a Break of Service shall\n          occur.\n\n          If such  a Break of Service occurs, said\n          employee  shall  lose   all  credit  for\n          Service  prior  to  and  including  said\n          three (3) year period . . . . \n\nSeafarers Pension Regulations, Article 2, Section D(1).\n\n          The  upshot is  that Diaz  received  a pension  of\n\nabout $200 per  month (and without certain  health benefits)\n\ninstead of the $450 per  month (plus such benefits) to which\n\nhe believed himself entitled.\n\n          C.  Procedure.    Diaz  brought  this  lawsuit  in\n                       \n\nfederal   district   court   under   ERISA,   29   U.S.C.   \n\n1132(a)(1)(B),  which  authorizes  an  employee  action  \"to\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nrecover benefits  due to him  under the terms of  his plan.\"\n\nERISA requires trustees to follow their own rules, see id.  \n                                                          \n\n1104(a)(1)(D), and Diaz argues that the trustees have failed\n\nto do  so by  misinterpreting the break  in service  rule in\n\napplying  it to  his  situation.   The district  court found\n\nagainst Diaz.\n\n                             II\n\n                     Standard of Review\n                                       \n\n          Ordinarily,   a    court   will    give   trustees\n\nconsiderable leeway to  interpret and to apply  pension plan\n\nrules,  setting aside those  trustee decisions only  if they\n\nare arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g.,  Lockhart v.  United  Mine  Workers  of  America  1974\n                                                            \n\nPension Trust, 5 F.3d 74, 78  n.6 (4th Cir. 1993); Gordon v.\n                                                         \n\nILWU-PMA  Benefit Funds, 616 F.2d  433, 439 (9th Cir. 1980).\n                       \n\nDiaz  points out, however,  that the Supreme  Court has said\n\nthat this deferential standard of review is appropriate only\n\nwhere the \"benefit plan\" itself gives the trustees\n\n          discretionary  authority   to  determine\n          eligibility for benefits  or to construe\n          the terms of the plan.\n\nFirestone  Tire &amp;  Rubber Co.  v. Bruch,  489 U.S.  101, 115\n                                       \n\n(1989); see also Allen v.  Adage, Inc., 967 F.2d 695, 697-98\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir. 1992).  Diaz says that the  version of the benefit\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nplan in effect when he applied for a pension did not provide\n\nthe trustees with the \"discretionary authority\" to determine\n\neligibility or  construe the terms  of the plan.   Hence, we\n\nmust review trustee decisions de novo.\n                                     \n\n          Diaz's   argument   is    unconvincing,   however.\n\nFirestone  concerned  certain  terms   (\"reduction  in  work\n         \n\nforce\")  set forth  in what  was in  effect the  basic trust\n\ninstrument, which  terms the trustees  had construed against\n\nthe employees.   The argument in the case  before us focuses\n\non  the application  (and implicit  interpretation),  not of\n\nterms contained in the basic  trust instrument, but of rules\n                                                            \n\npromulgated  by the trustees pursuant to powers delegated by\n                                                            \n\nthat instrument.  And, the distinction is important.\n               \n\n          The Firestone  opinion turned  on the  traditional\n                       \n\nlegal doctrine that trustee powers are \n\n          determined  by the rules of law that are\n          applicable to the situation . . . and by\n                                                  \n          the  terms of the trust as the court may\n                                                  \n          interpret  them, and not  as they may be\n                         \n          interpreted by the trustee himself . . .\n          .\n\n3  W. Fratcher,  Scott on  Trusts    201,  at 221  (emphasis\n\nadded); see  Firestone, 489 U.S.  at 112.   That is  to say,\n                      \n\ncourts  ordinarily  interpret  (independently)  the  trust's\n\nterms.  The Firestone Court concluded that, since\n                     \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n          there  is no  evidence  that under  [the\n          benefit plan] the  administrator has the\n          power to construe uncertain terms [i.e.,\n          terms of the  trust] or that eligibility\n                             \n          determinations   are    to   be    given\n          deference,\n\nthe proper standard of review is de novo.  489 U.S. at 111.\n                                        \n\n          Traditional trust  law, however, does  not suggest\n\nthat  courts   normally  should,  or  do,  substitute  their\n\njudgment for reasonable  trustee interpretations of  trustee\n\nrules  promulgated   pursuant  to  powers  that   the  trust\n\ninstrument  grants to those trustees.   To the contrary, one\n\nwould ordinarily assume  that a trust instrument's  grant of\n\npower to make  rules and to apply rules carries  with it (to\n\navoid  unnecessary  administrative  complexity)  an  implied\n\npower to interpret those  rules reasonably and  consistently\n\nwith  the  instrument and  other  provisions  of  law.   Cf.\n                                                            \n\nLockhart  v. United  Mine Workers  of  America 1974  Pension\n                                                            \n\nTrust, 5 F.3d 74,  78 n.6 (4th Cir.  1993) (\"Given that  the\n     \n\nTrustees  have  the  authority to  formulate  the  rules and\n                                            \n\nregulations  that implement  the  Plan .  .  . ,  it  is not\n\nsubject  to  question that  the  Trustees  have  the .  .  .\n\ndiscretion  to interpret these  rules and regulations  . . .\n                        \n\n.\") (citations omitted) (emphasis added).  And, courts would\n\npresumably  review  any  such exercise  of  delegated  rule-\n\ninterpretive  power  as  they would  any  other  exercise of\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\ndelegated  power, i.e., with a degree of interpretive leeway\n\nthat reflects the  trustees' likely better  understanding of\n\nhow they intended their own rules to apply.

The\n\ndocument specifically said:\n\n          The  Trustees  shall  without limitation\n                                                  \n          have  the  power  .   .  .  to  .   .  .\n          [f]ormulate and adopt  a pension program\n          . . . and promulgate and establish rules\n          . .  . for .  . .

It added a general\n\nclause stating:\n\n          The [T]rustees  are empowered to  do all\n                                                  \n          acts whether or not expressly authorized\n                                                  \n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\n          herein,  which the  [T]rustees may  deem\n          necessary  to  accomplish   the  general\n          purposes of the Trust.\n\nId. Section 5 (emphasis added).  \n   \n\n          This language demonstrates broad trustee authority\n\nto determine the content of  the rules they promulgate.  The\n\ndocument  provides  no reason  for  finding  any significant\n\ndifference   between   1)    determining   content   through\n\npromulgating  new  rules,  and  2)  determining  content  by\n\ninterpreting   old  ones.     Hence,  consistent   with  our\n\ndiscussion above,  we interpret the document's explicit, and\n\nbroad,  power to  create  \"rules\"  governing \"conditions  of\n\neligibility\" as carrying  with it a similarly  broad implied\n\npower to interpret those rules.

Not surprisingly, we think this amendment merely made\n\nexpress  a power  that,  for  reasons  already  stated,  was\n\nplainly implied  all along.   (Why  the trustees  decided to\n\nclarify the plan's language in  this way is not explained in\n\nthe record; perhaps they  wanted to play it safe in light of\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nFirestone  and the possibility that lower courts would later\n         \n\nmisread it.)\n\n          The   end  result  is  that  we  shall  apply  the\n\n\"arbitrary and capricious\" standard of review.\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n                            III\n\n                    Review of the Merits\n                                        \n\n          Diaz  concedes that  his absence  from  work after\n\nbeing  injured counted  as a  \"break in  service\" under  the\n\nplan's \"break in service\" rule as literally interpreted.  He\n                                                       \n\ndid not  perform three months of  SIU work in each  of three\n\nconsecutive years between 1968 and  1975.  But, Diaz  argues\n\nthat the trustees  should not interpret the  rule literally.\n\nHe says that  they should not  count an involuntary  absence\n                                                   \n\nfrom work --  a break caused, for example,  by an on-the-job\n\ninjury -- as a \"break in  service\" under the rule.  And,  he\n\npoints  to  several  circuit  court  cases  that  have  held\n\ntrustees' refusals to treat involuntary absences this way to\n\nbe  arbitrary and  capricious.   See,  e.g.,  Van Fossan  v.\n                                                            \n\nInternational  Bhd. of Teamsters Union Local No. 710 Pension\n                                                            \n\nFund,  649 F.2d 1243,  1248-49 (7th  Cir. 1981)  (finding it\n    \n\narbitrary and capricious to apply \"break in service\" rule to\n\nworker  who  leaves fund-covered  employment  involuntarily,\n\nsuch  as because  of a  permanent  shoulder disability,  and\n\nciting other circuit cases on point).\n\n          The  problem for  Diaz is  that  the trustees  are\n\nwilling  to  assume (for  purposes  of  this case)  that  an\n\ninvoluntary  absence does not count as  a \"break in service\"\n                             \n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nunder  the  rule.    But,  that  willingness  is  still  not\n\nsufficient  to win  Diaz  his augmented  pension.   That  is\n\nbecause the trustees say that any such \"involuntary absence\"\n\nexception  must  involve  an involuntary  absence  from  SIU\n                                                            \n\nservice, not  from some other  kind of service.   After all,\n\none who left SIU service well before 1968 and works steadily\n\nthereafter  in  a  totally  different  industry cannot,  and\n\nshould not be able to,  overcome the \"break in service\" rule\n\nsimply because an  injury caused him  to be absent  (between\n\n1968 and 1975) from that totally different job.\n                                          \n\n          The trustees  also recognize  that Diaz's  case is\n\nnot quite that simple.  He did, indeed, leave SIU employment\n\nwell before  1968 and  he did not  return to  SIU employment\n\nuntil after 1975, and he was employed on NMU, not SIU, ships\n\nin the interval.  But, when he did return to shipping, after\n\nrecovering from his injury in 1975, he returned to work, not\n\non NMU, but on SIU, ships.  In light of this fact,  it is at\n                  \n\nleast possible, as  the trustees rightly suggest,  that \"but\n\nfor his injury in 1968, he would have left the NMU ships and\n\nresumed  shipping with  the SIU\"  in  time not  to suffer  a\n\n\"break  in service\"  under the  rule --  in which  case, the\n\ntrustees  further suggest,  they  would have  ignored Diaz's\n\npost-injury absence.   But, they  add, the single  fact that\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nDiaz  returned to  SIU shipping  after  recovering from  his\n                                      \n\ninjury is not enough to show that he would have left the NMU\n\n(and  returned to  the SIU)  without the  injury.   In their\n                                    \n\nview, in the absence of an injury, it is more likely  that a\n\nseaman would  continue in,  rather than  leave, his  current\n\njob.\n\n          We  cannot quarrel with  the reasonableness of the\n\ntrustees'  interpretation of  their rule,  at  least on  the\n\nassumptions  they  are  willing to  make.    They assume  an\n\nexception  for  an  involuntary   break  in  service;   they\n\nunderstand the  special situation  of one  who has  left SIU\n\nemployment before, but  returns after, an injury;  and, they\n\nimpose a minimal  factual SIU-connection,  namely a  showing\n\nthat, without  the injury, the  seaman would have  worked on\n\nSIU  ships.   But, whether  or not  Diaz made  the requisite\n\nfactual  showing  --   dependent  as  the  question   is  on\n\ngeneralizations about  how seafarers ordinarily behave -- is\n\nprecisely the kind of matter that courts should leave in the\n\nhands of the trustees, who,  after all, often must draw upon\n\ntheir  knowledge of  the industry  in deciding  how best  to\n\nshare a limited amount of money among different plan members\n\nwith varying claims,  of varying strength.

The Plan's failure to do so, in Diaz's view, represents an erroneous application of the Plan's own pension-calculation rules and thereby violates federal law.  See Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104(a)(1)(D) (\"[Plan trustees] shall discharge [their] duties ... in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan....\").

From 1943 to 1960 Diaz worked on ships whose employees were represented by the Seafarers International Union (SIU).  During that period, the SIU had no pension plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. In 1960 Diaz quit.

In 1975 Diaz recovered from his injury and began to work again as a seaman, this time on SIU ships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. In 1988 Diaz retired, at age 65, having spent the previous 13 years on SIU ships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Seafarers Pension Plan.   The Seafarers Pension Plan provides pensions based upon time worked on SIU ships, but not on other ships.  It normally permits a seafarer to include, in the pension level calculation, time that he worked even before the plan first came into existence in 1961--even though employers did not contribute before 1961 and the relevant pension funds must therefore come from contributions (and related investment earnings) made in respect to work performed later, and by others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the ordinary practice of crediting pre-1961 work, the trustees gave Diaz credit only for the 13 years he worked on SIU ships after he recovered from his injury in 1975 and returned to SIU work.  They denied him credit for the 17 years he worked on SIU ships before he left SIU employment in 1961 (and before the SIU had any pension plan) because they concluded that, in respect to that work, Diaz suffered a \"break in service\" under the plan's \"break in service\" rule.  The rule prohibits counting work prior to a \"break in service,\" defined as failure to perform 90 or more days of SIU work in each of three consecutive calendar years between 1968 and 1975 (when ERISA took effect).  The rule states specifically:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>If during the period from January 1, 1968 to December 31, 1975, an employee received credit for less than 90 days of Service in each of three (3) consecutive calendar years, a Break of Service shall occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>If such a Break of Service occurs, said employee shall lose all credit for Service prior to and including said three (3) year period....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seafarers Pension Regulations, Article 2, Section D(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot is that Diaz received a pension of about $200 per month (and without certain health benefits) instead of the $450 per month (plus such benefits) to which he believed himself entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Procedure.   Diaz brought this lawsuit in federal district court under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a)(1)(B), which authorizes an employee action \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.\"   ERISA requires trustees to follow their own rules, see id. Sec. 1104(a)(1)(D), and Diaz argues that the trustees have failed to do so by misinterpreting the break in service rule in applying it to his situation.  The district court found against Diaz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, a court will give trustees considerable leeway to interpret and to apply pension plan rules, setting aside those trustee decisions only if they are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.   See, e.g., Lockhart v. United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Trust, 5 F.3d 74, 78 n. 6 (4th Cir.1993);   Gordon v. ILWU-PMA Benefit Funds, 616 F.2d 433, 439 (9th Cir.1980).  Diaz points out, however, that the Supreme Court has said that this deferential standard of review is appropriate only where the \"benefit plan\" itself gives the trustees</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 956-57, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989);  see also Allen v. Adage, Inc., 967 F.2d 695, 697-98 (1st Cir.1992).  Diaz says that the version of the benefit plan in effect when he applied for a pension did not provide the trustees with the \"discretionary authority\" to determine eligibility or construe the terms of the plan.  Hence, we must review trustee decisions de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz's argument is unconvincing, however.  Firestone concerned certain terms (\"reduction in work force\") set forth in what was in effect the basic trust instrument, which terms the trustees had construed against the employees.  The argument in the case before us focuses on the application (and implicit interpretation), not of terms contained in the basic trust instrument, but of rules promulgated by the trustees pursuant to powers delegated by that instrument.   And, the distinction is important.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Firestone opinion turned on the traditional legal doctrine that trustee powers are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>determined by the rules of law that are applicable to the situation ... and by the terms of the trust as the court may interpret them, and not as they may be interpreted by the trustee himself....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3 W. Fratcher, Scott on Trusts Sec. 201, at 221 (emphasis added);  see Firestone, 489 U.S. at 112, 109 S.Ct. at 955.   That is to say, courts ordinarily interpret (independently) the trust's terms.  The Firestone Court concluded that, since</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>there is no evidence that under [the benefit plan] the administrator has the power to construe uncertain terms [i.e., terms of the trust ] or that eligibility determinations are to be given deference,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the proper standard of review is de novo.  489 U.S. at 111, 109 S.Ct. at 955.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditional trust law, however, does not suggest that courts normally should, or do, substitute their judgment for reasonable trustee interpretations of trustee rules promulgated pursuant to powers that the trust instrument grants to those trustees.  To the contrary, one would ordinarily assume that a trust instrument's grant of power to make rules and to apply rules carries with it (to avoid unnecessary administrative complexity) an implied power to interpret those rules reasonably and consistently with the instrument and other provisions of law.  Cf. Lockhart v. United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Trust, 5 F.3d 74, 78 n. 6 (4th Cir.1993) (\"Given that the Trustees have the authority to formulate the rules and regulations that implement the Plan ..., it is not subject to question that the Trustees have the ... discretion to interpret these rules and regulations....\") (citations omitted) (emphasis added).  And, courts would presumably review any such exercise of delegated rule-interpretive power as they would any other exercise of delegated power, i.e., with a degree of interpretive leeway that reflects the trustees' likely better understanding of how they intended their own rules to apply.  Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts Sec. 187 (\"Where discretion is conferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a power, its exercise is not subject to control by the court, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discretion.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the terms of the trust itself are not in issue.  The trust document, at the time of Diaz's application, gave the trustees broad, discretionary, authority to make, and to apply, rules governing eligibility for pensions.

The document provides no reason for finding any significant difference between 1) determining content through promulgating new rules, and 2) determining content by interpreting old ones.  Hence, consistent with our discussion above, we interpret the document's explicit, and broad, power to create \"rules\" governing \"conditions of eligibility\" as carrying with it a similarly broad implied power to interpret those rules.  And, the existence of such a delegated power seems to be what Firestone had in mind when it called for \"evidence\" of a grant of discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits.  Firestone, 489 U.S. at 111, 109 S.Ct. at 954;  cf. Curtis v. Noel, 877 F.2d 159, 161 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that plan language giving plan administrator power to determine \"which Employees are eligible to participate in the Plan\" and \"provid[ing] all parties dealing with the Plan an interpretation of Plan provisions on request\" indicates deferential standard of review of trustee eligibility decisions);  Jett v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama, Inc., 890 F.2d 1137, 1138-39 (11th Cir.1989) (same for plan language giving \"Claims Administrator\" power to make \"final and conclusive\" determinations \"in the administration of the [plan],\" so long as such determinations are \"reasonable\");  but cf. Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis v. SwedishAmerican Group Health Benefit Trust, 901 F.2d 1369, 1371 (7th Cir.1990) (explaining that circuit courts appear split over the degree of plan language specificity required to trigger deferential review of trustee determinations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Diaz argues that the trustees, in effect, confessed that the SIU plan does not meet Firestone 's requirements for deferential review, for, after Firestone (and after Diaz had applied for his pension), the trustees sought and obtained an amendment to the plan document giving them the \"absolute and exclusive authority to ... interpret Plan Rules\" and \"sole discretion to ... apply\" them.  Not surprisingly, we think this amendment merely made express a power that, for reasons already stated, was plainly implied all along.  (Why the trustees decided to clarify the plan's language in this way is not explained in the record;  perhaps they wanted to play it safe in light of Firestone and the possibility that lower courts would later misread it.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The end result is that we shall apply the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Review of the Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz concedes that his absence from work after being injured counted as a \"break in service\" under the plan's \"break in service\" rule as literally interpreted.   He did not perform three months of SIU work in each of three consecutive years between 1968 and 1975.  But, Diaz argues that the trustees should not interpret the rule literally.  He says that they should not count an involuntary absence from work--a break caused, for example, by an on-the-job injury--as a \"break in service\" under the rule.  And, he points to several circuit court cases that have held trustees' refusals to treat involuntary absences this way to be arbitrary and capricious.  See, e.g., Van Fossan v. International Bhd. of Teamsters Union Local No. 710 Pension Fund, 649 F.2d 1243, 1248-49 (7th Cir.1981) (finding it arbitrary and capricious to apply \"break in service\" rule to worker who leaves fund-covered employment involuntarily, such as because of a permanent shoulder disability, and citing other circuit cases on point).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem for Diaz is that the trustees are willing to assume (for purposes of this case) that an involuntary absence does not count as a \"break in service\" under the rule.  But, that willingness is still not sufficient to win Diaz his augmented pension.  That is because the trustees say that any such \"involuntary absence\" exception must involve an involuntary absence from SIU service, not from some other kind of service.  After all, one who left SIU service well before 1968 and works steadily thereafter in a totally different industry cannot, and should not be able to, overcome the \"break in service\" rule simply because an injury caused him to be absent (between 1968 and 1975) from that totally different job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustees also recognize that Diaz's case is not quite that simple.  He did, indeed, leave SIU employment well before 1968 and he did not return to SIU employment until after 1975, and he was employed on NMU, not SIU, ships in the interval.  But, when he did return to shipping, after recovering from his injury in 1975, he returned to work, not on NMU, but on SIU, ships.  In light of this fact, it is at least possible, as the trustees rightly suggest, that \"but for his injury in 1968, he would have left the NMU ships and resumed shipping with the SIU\" in time not to suffer a \"break in service\" under the rule--in which case, the trustees further suggest, they would have ignored Diaz's post-injury absence.  But, they add, the single fact that Diaz returned to SIU shipping after recovering from his injury is not enough to show that he would have left the NMU (and returned to the SIU) without the injury.  In their view, in the absence of an injury, it is more likely that a seaman would continue in, rather than leave, his current job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot quarrel with the reasonableness of the trustees' interpretation of their rule, at least on the assumptions they are willing to make.  They assume an exception for an involuntary break in service;  they understand the special situation of one who has left SIU employment before, but returns after, an injury;  and, they impose a minimal factual SIU-connection, namely a showing that, without the injury, the seaman would have worked on SIU ships.  But, whether or not Diaz made the requisite factual showing--dependent as the question is on generalizations about how seafarers ordinarily behave--is precisely the kind of matter that courts should leave in the hands of the trustees, who, after all, often must draw upon their knowledge of the industry in deciding how best to share a limited amount of money among different plan members with varying claims, of varying strength.  See Richards v. United Mine Workers of Am.  Health &amp; Retirement Funds, 851 F.2d 122, 123 (4th Cir.1988) (\"[W]e may not substitute our judgment of the facts in this case for that of the Trustees, for it is the Trustees whose expertise in this area arises from daily and continual experience.\")  (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, and against the backdrop that the payment at stake here is for pre-1961 service (a time when no pension fund existed and no one made contributions on behalf of Diaz's work), we cannot say that the trustees' interpretation or application of their rule was arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The Plan's failure to do so, in Diaz's view, represents an erroneous application of the Plan's own pension-calculation rules and thereby violates federal law.  See Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104(a)(1)(D) (\"[Plan trustees] shall discharge [their] duties ... in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan....\").

From 1943 to 1960 Diaz worked on ships whose employees were represented by the Seafarers International Union (SIU).  During that period, the SIU had no pension plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. In 1960 Diaz quit.

In 1961 the SIU developed a pension plan--the Seafarers Pension Plan--covering seafarers who work on SIU-represented ships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. In 1968 Diaz, then still working on NMU ships, was injured and stopped working as a seaman altogether.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. In 1975 Diaz recovered from his injury and began to work again as a seaman, this time on SIU ships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. In 1988 Diaz retired, at age 65, having spent the previous 13 years on SIU ships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Seafarers Pension Plan.   The Seafarers Pension Plan provides pensions based upon time worked on SIU ships, but not on other ships.  It normally permits a seafarer to include, in the pension level calculation, time that he worked even before the plan first came into existence in 1961--even though employers did not contribute before 1961 and the relevant pension funds must therefore come from contributions (and related investment earnings) made in respect to work performed later, and by others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the ordinary practice of crediting pre-1961 work, the trustees gave Diaz credit only for the 13 years he worked on SIU ships after he recovered from his injury in 1975 and returned to SIU work.  They denied him credit for the 17 years he worked on SIU ships before he left SIU employment in 1961 (and before the SIU had any pension plan) because they concluded that, in respect to that work, Diaz suffered a \"break in service\" under the plan's \"break in service\" rule.  The rule prohibits counting work prior to a \"break in service,\" defined as failure to perform 90 or more days of SIU work in each of three consecutive calendar years between 1968 and 1975 (when ERISA took effect).  The rule states specifically:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>If during the period from January 1, 1968 to December 31, 1975, an employee received credit for less than 90 days of Service in each of three (3) consecutive calendar years, a Break of Service shall occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>If such a Break of Service occurs, said employee shall lose all credit for Service prior to and including said three (3) year period....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seafarers Pension Regulations, Article 2, Section D(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot is that Diaz received a pension of about $200 per month (and without certain health benefits) instead of the $450 per month (plus such benefits) to which he believed himself entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Procedure.   Diaz brought this lawsuit in federal district court under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a)(1)(B), which authorizes an employee action \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.\"   ERISA requires trustees to follow their own rules, see id. Sec. 1104(a)(1)(D), and Diaz argues that the trustees have failed to do so by misinterpreting the break in service rule in applying it to his situation.  The district court found against Diaz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, a court will give trustees considerable leeway to interpret and to apply pension plan rules, setting aside those trustee decisions only if they are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.   See, e.g., Lockhart v. United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Trust, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652929\"><a href=\"/opinion/652929/clarence-e-lockhart-v-united-mine-workers-of-america-1974-pension-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 78 n. 6 (4th Cir.1993);   Gordon v.

Diaz says that the version of the benefit plan in effect when he applied for a pension did not provide the trustees with the \"discretionary authority\" to determine eligibility or construe the terms of the plan.  Hence, we must review trustee decisions de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz's argument is unconvincing, however.  Firestone concerned certain terms (\"reduction in work force\") set forth in what was in effect the basic trust instrument, which terms the trustees had construed against the employees.  The argument in the case before us focuses on the application (and implicit interpretation), not of terms contained in the basic trust instrument, but of rules promulgated by the trustees pursuant to powers delegated by that instrument.   And, the distinction is important.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Firestone opinion turned on the traditional legal doctrine that trustee powers are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>determined by the rules of law that are applicable to the situation ... and by the terms of the trust as the court may interpret them, and not as they may be interpreted by the trustee himself....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3 W. Fratcher, Scott on Trusts Sec. 201, at 221 (emphasis added);  see Firestone, 489 U.S. at 112, 109 S.Ct. at 955.   That is to say, courts ordinarily interpret (independently) the trust's terms.  The Firestone Court concluded that, since</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>there is no evidence that under [the benefit plan] the administrator has the power to construe uncertain terms [i.e., terms of the trust ] or that eligibility determinations are to be given deference,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the proper standard of review is de novo.  489 U.S. at 111, 109 S.Ct. at 955.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditional trust law, however, does not suggest that courts normally should, or do, substitute their judgment for reasonable trustee interpretations of trustee rules promulgated pursuant to powers that the trust instrument grants to those trustees.  To the contrary, one would ordinarily assume that a trust instrument's grant of power to make rules and to apply rules carries with it (to avoid unnecessary administrative complexity) an implied power to interpret those rules reasonably and consistently with the instrument and other provisions of law.  Cf. Lockhart v. United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Trust, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652929\"><a href=\"/opinion/652929/clarence-e-lockhart-v-united-mine-workers-of-america-1974-pension-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 78 n. 6 (4th Cir.1993) (\"Given that the Trustees have the authority to formulate the rules and regulations that implement the Plan ..., it is not subject to question that the Trustees have the ... discretion to interpret these rules and regulations....\") (citations omitted) (emphasis added).  And, courts would presumably review any such exercise of delegated rule-interpretive power as they would any other exercise of delegated power, i.e., with a degree of interpretive leeway that reflects the trustees' likely better understanding of how they intended their own rules to apply.  Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts Sec. 187 (\"Where discretion is conferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a power, its exercise is not subject to control by the court, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discretion.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the terms of the trust itself are not in issue.  The trust document, at the time of Diaz's application, gave the trustees broad, discretionary, authority to make, and to apply, rules governing eligibility for pensions.  The document specifically said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>The Trustees shall without limitation have the power ... to ...

The document provides no reason for finding any significant difference between 1) determining content through promulgating new rules, and 2) determining content by interpreting old ones.  Hence, consistent with our discussion above, we interpret the document's explicit, and broad, power to create \"rules\" governing \"conditions of eligibility\" as carrying with it a similarly broad implied power to interpret those rules.  And, the existence of such a delegated power seems to be what Firestone had in mind when it called for \"evidence\" of a grant of discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits.

SwedishAmerican Group Health Benefit Trust, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540365\"><a href=\"/opinion/540365/sisters-of-the-third-order-of-st-francis-doing-business-as-saint-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1369</span></a></span>, 1371 (7th Cir.1990) (explaining that circuit courts appear split over the degree of plan language specificity required to trigger deferential review of trustee determinations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Diaz argues that the trustees, in effect, confessed that the SIU plan does not meet Firestone 's requirements for deferential review, for, after Firestone (and after Diaz had applied for his pension), the trustees sought and obtained an amendment to the plan document giving them the \"absolute and exclusive authority to ... interpret Plan Rules\" and \"sole discretion to ... apply\" them.  Not surprisingly, we think this amendment merely made express a power that, for reasons already stated, was plainly implied all along.  (Why the trustees decided to clarify the plan's language in this way is not explained in the record;  perhaps they wanted to play it safe in light of Firestone and the possibility that lower courts would later misread it.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The end result is that we shall apply the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Review of the Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz concedes that his absence from work after being injured counted as a \"break in service\" under the plan's \"break in service\" rule as literally interpreted.   He did not perform three months of SIU work in each of three consecutive years between 1968 and 1975.  But, Diaz argues that the trustees should not interpret the rule literally.  He says that they should not count an involuntary absence from work--a break caused, for example, by an on-the-job injury--as a \"break in service\" under the rule.  And, he points to several circuit court cases that have held trustees' refusals to treat involuntary absences this way to be arbitrary and capricious.  See, e.g., Van Fossan v. International Bhd. of Teamsters Union Local No. 710 Pension Fund, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390881\"><a href=\"/opinion/390881/milton-van-fossan-v-international-brotherhood-of-teamsters-union-local-no/\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span>, 1248-49 (7th Cir.1981) (finding it arbitrary and capricious to apply \"break in service\" rule to worker who leaves fund-covered employment involuntarily, such as because of a permanent shoulder disability, and citing other circuit cases on point).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem for Diaz is that the trustees are willing to assume (for purposes of this case) that an involuntary absence does not count as a \"break in service\" under the rule.  But, that willingness is still not sufficient to win Diaz his augmented pension.  That is because the trustees say that any such \"involuntary absence\" exception must involve an involuntary absence from SIU service, not from some other kind of service.  After all, one who left SIU service well before 1968 and works steadily thereafter in a totally different industry cannot, and should not be able to, overcome the \"break in service\" rule simply because an injury caused him to be absent (between 1968 and 1975) from that totally different job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustees also recognize that Diaz's case is not quite that simple.  He did, indeed, leave SIU employment well before 1968 and he did not return to SIU employment until after 1975, and he was employed on NMU, not SIU, ships in the interval.  But, when he did return to shipping, after recovering from his injury in 1975, he returned to work, not on NMU, but on SIU, ships.  In light of this fact, it is at least possible, as the trustees rightly suggest, that \"but for his injury in 1968, he would have left the NMU ships and resumed shipping with the SIU\" in time not to suffer a \"break in service\" under the rule--in which case, the trustees further suggest, they would have ignored Diaz's post-injury absence.  But, they add, the single fact that Diaz returned to SIU shipping after recovering from his injury is not enough to show that he would have left the NMU (and returned to the SIU) without the injury.  In their view, in the absence of an injury, it is more likely that a seaman would continue in, rather than leave, his current job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot quarrel with the reasonableness of the trustees' interpretation of their rule, at least on the assumptions they are willing to make.  They assume an exception for an involuntary break in service;  they understand the special situation of one who has left SIU employment before, but returns after, an injury;  and, they impose a minimal factual SIU-connection, namely a showing that, without the injury, the seaman would have worked on SIU ships.  But, whether or not Diaz made the requisite factual showing--dependent as the question is on generalizations about how seafarers ordinarily behave--is precisely the kind of matter that courts should leave in the hands of the trustees, who, after all, often must draw upon their knowledge of the industry in deciding how best to share a limited amount of money among different plan members with varying claims, of varying strength.

Health &amp; Retirement Funds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508532\"><a href=\"/opinion/508532/homer-richards-and-anna-mae-richards-v-united-mine-workers-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span>, 123 (4th Cir.1988) (\"[W]e may not substitute our judgment of the facts in this case for that of the Trustees, for it is the Trustees whose expertise in this area arises from daily and continual experience.\")  (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, and against the backdrop that the payment at stake here is for pre-1961 service (a time when no pension fund existed and no one made contributions on behalf of Diaz's work), we cannot say that the trustees' interpretation or application of their rule was arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
