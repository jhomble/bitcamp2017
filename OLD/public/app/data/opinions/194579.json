The arbitrator\n\nrequired appellees to  honor pre-existing labor  agreements, with\n\nseveral  exceptions.  On review, the  ICC upheld the arbitrator's\n\ndecision and held that this relief would not apply retroactively.\n\nIt also determined that the  affected employees were entitled  to\n\ncertain limited benefits.

This  time,\n\nhowever, they  requested  damages arising  out  of  \"unauthorized\n\nactions,\" in  contrast  to the  original  action arising  out  of\n\nactions  authorized by the ICC.  The district court dismissed the\n\nclaim, apparently relying on  res judicata and a lack  of subject\n                                          \n\nmatter jurisdiction.        DISCUSSION\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nI.  Res Judicata\n\n          It  is  unclear whether  the district  court determined\n\nthat RLEA I precluded this  case in its entirety or if  it simply\n           \n\nfound that RLEA I barred appellants from relitigating that case's\n                 \n\nfinding  on  the  scope of  the    11341  exemption.3   Thus,  we\n\naddress both issues.  \n\n          A.  Claim preclusion\n\n          The  res  judicata  doctrine  provides  that  \"a  final\n                            \n\njudgment  on the merits bars a  subsequent suit on the same cause\n\nof action by the same parties and their privies.\"  Walsh v. Int'l\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n3   The court stated,  \"RLEA I  dismissed the RLA  claims on  the\n                              \ngrounds that the   11341 exemption 'relieves the participants [in\nthe  exempted transaction]  from any  legal obstacles  that would\n                                    \nimpede the transaction. . . .'   That ruling is res  judicata and\n                                                             \napplies  in all respects here.\"  Appellants assert that the court\ndecided that RLEA I precluded them from relitigating the scope of\n                   \nthe    11341 exemption, while appellees argue that the court held\nthat RLEA I precludes appellants' entire claim.\n           \n\n   Technically,  res judicata represents  claim preclusion, while\n                             \ncollateral estoppel refers to issue preclusion.   As evidenced by\n                   \nthis  appeal, much  confusion  arises when  courts use  the terms\ninterchangeably.  \n\n                               -4-\n\nLongshoremen's Ass'n, 630 F.2d 864, 870 (1st Cir. 1980).  \n                    \n\n          Superficially,  the present  case seems  to fit  within\n\nthis test.    RLEA I  involved the  same parties  as the  present\n                    \n\naction.   In addition, as the court  in RLEA I dismissed the case\n                                              \n\nfor  a lack of subject  matter jurisdiction, it  rendered a final\n\njudgment on the  merits.  Id. (stating that once  a court finds a\n                            \n\nlack   of  subject   matter  jurisdiction,   res   judicata  bars\n                                                           \n\nrelitigation of that issue).  However, the present case  does not\n\ninvolve the same cause of action as RLEA I.   Although appellants\n                                          \n\nattack the same lease  transactions that were in dispute  in RLEA\n                                                                 \n\nI,  they could  not have  asserted their  present claims  in that\n \n\naction, and thus cannot be precluded by res judicata.\n                                                    \n\n          In  RLEA  I, appellants  asked  the  district court  to\n                     \n\nprevent  actions by appellees that the ICC had authorized; in the\n\npresent  case, they  seek relief  based on  actions that  the ICC\n\nnever authorized.  When appellees implemented the leases, the ICC\n\ninformed them that it would impose labor protective conditions on\n\nthe leases in a separate decision.  ICC Finance Docket No. 30967,\n\nMEC-Lease, Notice  of Exemption at 5-6, served  January 23, 1987.\n\nThe ICC specifically warned that  if appellees proceeded with the\n\nleases and only minimal  levels of protection,4 they would  do so\n\nat their own risk.

Appellees  continued  implementing  the  leases  and\n\nprovided only minimal protections, allegedly violating the RLA in\n\nthe process.   It was not until February 19,  1988, almost a year\n\nafter  RLEA I, that the  ICC decided to  require additional labor\n             \n\nprotections.   Delaware  &amp; Hudson  Ry. Co.  - Lease  and Trackage\n                                                                 \n\nRights Exemption  - Springfield Terminal Ry.

As appellees  did  not  provide these  additional\n\nprotections until the ICC explicitly required them, their initial\n\nactions were  unauthorized.  Essentially, appellees  gambled that\n\nthey  would  convince  the  ICC  that  their  actions  should  be\n\nauthorized, and they were unsuccessful.  \n\n          Appellants could  not have asserted  their claims based\n\non the lack of  authorization of certain actions by  appellees in\n\nRLEA I because  they did  not know during  that litigation  which\n      \n\nactions  the ICC authorized.   Thus, they are  not precluded from\n\nasserting these claims  now.   Car Carriers, Inc.  v. Ford  Motor\n                                                                 \n\nCo.,  789 F.2d 589, 593 (7th  Cir. 1986) (although mere change in\n   \n\nlegal theory  does not create a new cause of action, res judicata\n                                                                 \n\nwill not bar parties from raising issues that they could not have\n\nraised  in first  litigation);  see also  United  States v.

Issue Preclusion\n\n          Appellants  do  not  challenge  the   district  court's\n\nfinding  of res  judicata  provided that,  by  res judicata,  the\n                                                           \n\ndistrict court meant issue  preclusion with respect to  the scope\n\nof the    11341 exemption.  As the parties agree on this point of\n\n                               -6-\n\nlaw, we need not analyze it further.       \n\nII.  Relationship with the ICC decision\n\n          Having determined  that res judicata does  not bar this\n                                              \n\nclaim,  we now  decide whether  appellants properly  brought suit\n\nbefore the district court.  \n\n          Disputes concerning the  interpretation or  enforcement\n\nof  the  ICC's labor  protective  decisions must  be  resolved by\n\narbitration  or the ICC.  Augspurger v. Brotherhood of Locomotive\n                                                                 \n\nEng'rs, 510 F.2d 853, 860 (8th Cir. 1975).  \n      \n\n          In the  present case, the ICC and  two arbitrators have\n\nthoroughly  examined  appellees'  actions  in   implementing  the\n\nleases.  As  a result, the ICC determined  that employees of rail\n\ncarriers who were adversely affected by the transactions were not\n\nentitled  to retroactive  relief,  but were  entitled to  certain\n\nbenefits.  These benefits included a maximum of seventy five days\n\nof make-whole benefits and  up to six years of  protective period\n\nbenefits  beginning at  the later  of the  effective date  of the\n\nimplementing  agreement imposing the  required conditions and the\n\ndate when the  adverse effect  began.  Finance  Docket No.  30965\n\n(Sub-Nos. 1 &amp;  2), Delaware &amp;  Hudson Ry. Co. Lease  and Trackage\n\nRights  Exemption -Springfield  Terminal  Ry. Co.  at 15,  served\n\nApril 2, 1992.   Appellants were unable to persuade the  ICC that\n\nfurther labor  protection could be reconciled  with the essential\n\npurposes  of the  leases.   If appellants  disagree with  the ICC\n\ndeterminations, their recourse is  through appeal.  Indeed, their\n\nappeal  of the ruling is currently pending before another circuit\n\n                               -7-\n\ncourt.  \n\n          By  asking  the  district  court  to  make  independent\n\nfindings regarding  the extent of  labor protection which  can be\n\nreconciled  with  the disputed  leases,  they  are initiating  an\n\nimpermissible  collateral attack  upon  the ICC's  decisions, see\n                                                                 \n\nBoston   &amp;  Maine  Corp.,  788  F.2d  at  799,  and  risking  the\n                        \n\npossibility of inconsistent judgments  between this court and the\n\nCourt  of  Appeals  for the  District  of  Columbia.   We  cannot\n\ncountenance  such a  situation.   Thus,  we  affirm the  district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the claim albeit on different grounds.5  \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n5    The district  court apparently  based  its dismissal  on the\nground  that the  ICC, not the  district court,  should determine\nwhether  an exemption from the RLA is  necessary to carry out the\nlease transactions as required  by   11341.  Since we  affirm the\ndistrict court's dismissal on  the ground that the claim  posed a\ncollateral attack on an ICC determination, we need not reach this\nissue.  \n\n                               -8-\n",

The arbitrator\n\nrequired appellees to  honor pre-existing labor  agreements, with\n\nseveral  exceptions.  On review, the  ICC upheld the arbitrator's\n\ndecision and held that this relief would not apply retroactively.\n\nIt also determined that the  affected employees were entitled  to\n\ncertain limited benefits.

This  time,\n\nhowever, they  requested  damages arising  out  of  \"unauthorized\n\nactions,\" in  contrast  to the  original  action arising  out  of\n\nactions  authorized by the ICC.  The district court dismissed the\n\nclaim, apparently relying on  res judicata and a lack  of subject\n                                          \n\nmatter jurisdiction.

Claim preclusion\n\n          The  res  judicata  doctrine  provides  that  \"a  final\n                            \n\njudgment  on the merits bars a  subsequent suit on the same cause\n\nof action by the same parties and their privies.\"  Walsh v.

That ruling is res  judicata and\n                                                             \napplies  in all respects here.\"  Appellants assert that the court\ndecided that RLEA I precluded them from relitigating the scope of\n                   \nthe    11341 exemption, while appellees argue that the court held\nthat RLEA I precludes appellants' entire claim.\n           \n\n   Technically,  res judicata represents  claim preclusion, while\n                             \ncollateral estoppel refers to issue preclusion.   As evidenced by\n                   \nthis  appeal, much  confusion  arises when  courts use  the terms\ninterchangeably.  \n\n                               -4-\n\nLongshoremen's Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382190\"><a href=\"/opinion/382190/michael-f-walsh-etc-v-international-longshoremens-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 870 (1st Cir. 1980).  \n                    \n\n          Superficially,  the present  case seems  to fit  within\n\nthis test.    RLEA I  involved the  same parties  as the  present\n                    \n\naction.   In addition, as the court  in RLEA I dismissed the case\n                                              \n\nfor  a lack of subject  matter jurisdiction, it  rendered a final\n\njudgment on the  merits.

When appellees implemented the leases, the ICC\n\ninformed them that it would impose labor protective conditions on\n\nthe leases in a separate decision.  ICC Finance Docket No. 30967,\n\nMEC-Lease, Notice  of Exemption at 5-6, served  January 23, 1987.\n\nThe ICC specifically warned that  if appellees proceeded with the\n\nleases and only minimal  levels of protection,4 they would  do so\n\nat their own risk.

Appellees  continued  implementing  the  leases  and\n\nprovided only minimal protections, allegedly violating the RLA in\n\nthe process.   It was not until February 19,  1988, almost a year\n\nafter  RLEA I, that the  ICC decided to  require additional labor\n             \n\nprotections.   Delaware  &amp; Hudson  Ry.

As appellees  did  not  provide these  additional\n\nprotections until the ICC explicitly required them, their initial\n\nactions were  unauthorized.  Essentially, appellees  gambled that\n\nthey  would  convince  the  ICC  that  their  actions  should  be\n\nauthorized, and they were unsuccessful.  \n\n          Appellants could  not have asserted  their claims based\n\non the lack of  authorization of certain actions by  appellees in\n\nRLEA I because  they did  not know during  that litigation  which\n      \n\nactions  the ICC authorized.

These benefits included a maximum of seventy five days\n\nof make-whole benefits and  up to six years of  protective period\n\nbenefits  beginning at  the later  of the  effective date  of the\n\nimplementing  agreement imposing the  required conditions and the\n\ndate when the  adverse effect  began.

Indeed, their\n\nappeal  of the ruling is currently pending before another circuit\n\n                               -7-\n\ncourt.  \n\n          By  asking  the  district  court  to  make  independent\n\nfindings regarding  the extent of  labor protection which  can be\n\nreconciled  with  the disputed  leases,  they  are initiating  an\n\nimpermissible  collateral attack  upon  the ICC's  decisions, see\n                                                                 \n\nBoston   &amp;  Maine  Corp.,  788  F.2d  at  799,  and  risking  the\n                        \n\npossibility of inconsistent judgments  between this court and the\n\nCourt  of  Appeals  for the  District  of  Columbia.   We  cannot\n\ncountenance  such a  situation.   Thus,  we  affirm the  district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the claim albeit on different grounds.5  \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n5    The district  court apparently  based  its dismissal  on the\nground  that the  ICC, not the  district court,  should determine\nwhether  an exemption from the RLA is  necessary to carry out the\nlease transactions as required  by   11341.  Since we  affirm the\ndistrict court's dismissal on  the ground that the claim  posed a\ncollateral attack on an ICC determination, we need not reach this\nissue.  \n\n                               -8-\n</pre>",
