Gale,  United  States Attorney,  and Kenneth  P. Madden,\r                                                                             \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \r\n\n          Per  Curiam.   Defendant-appellant Ramon  Abreu was\r                                 \n\nconvicted  on July  5, 1990  of thirteen  counts of  drug and\n\nfirearms offenses,  and was sentenced  to twenty-eight  years\n\nimprisonment.    On  January  3, 1992,  this  court  affirmed\n\nAbreu's  conviction,  with  the  exception  that  this  court\n\nvacated  his  conviction  on   one  count  of  conspiracy  to\n\ndistribute cocaine.   United States v.  Abreu, 952 F.2d  1458\r                                                         \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1695 (1992).\r                                    \n\n          On April 12, 1993,  Abreu filed a pro se  motion to\n\nvacate sentence under 28  U.S.C.   2255, raising a  number of\n\ngrounds.   On  May 24,  1993, he  filed an  amendment to  his\n\nmotion,  raising additional  grounds.    The  district  court\n\ndenied Abreu's motion on June 7, 1993.  We affirm.\n\n          Prosecutorial misconduct in the grand jury\r                                                                \n\n          Abreu    alleges    that    a   Drug    Enforcement\n\nAdministration agent, Robert Botelho, gave perjured testimony\n\nto the grand jury that indicted Abreu.  Specifically, Botelho\n\ntestified  to the grand jury that Abreu had stated that Abreu\n\nhad ten  people working for  him.  Botelho  further testified\n\nthat in searching an apartment in Woonsocket, R.I. from which\n\na  handgun and $ 26,000 in U.S. currency were seized, federal\n\nagents  also  seized  utility  bills  and  correspondence  in\n\nAbreu's name.  In contrast, other federal agents testified at\r\n\ntrial  that Abreu had stated that  he had six or seven people\n\nworking  for  him; that  a  video  card,  insurance cards,  a\n\nreceipt for an insurance payment, and money transfer receipts\n\nin  Abreu's name were seized from the apartment; and that the\n\nmoney  transfer receipts  listed  the  apartment  as  Abreu's\n\naddress.   \n\n          We  agree  with  the   district  court  that  Agent\n\nBotelho's  misstatements to  the  grand jury  could not  have\n\nprejudiced Abreu.  The  precise number of people working  for\n\nAbreu was relevant  only to his  conviction for conducting  a\n\ncontinuing criminal  enterprise in  violation of 21  U.S.C.  \n\n848.  That section  requires acting \"in concert with  five or\r                                                                         \n\nmore other persons with respect to whom such person  occupies\r                \n\na position of organizer, a supervisory position, or any other\n\nposition of management.\"   21 U.S.C.   848(c)(2)(A) (emphasis\n\nadded).   It  was therefore  of no  importance  whether Abreu\n\nsupervised six people or  ten, as long as he  supervised five\n\nor more.  \n\n          Similarly,  the documents bearing Abreu's name that\n\nwere  seized at the  apartment were relevant  only to connect\n\nAbreu to that apartment, where  evidence of drug and firearms\n\noffenses had been found.   The particular documents testified\n\nto at trial -- especially the money transfer receipts listing\n\nthe  apartment   as  Abreu's  address   --  established  that\n\n                             -3-\r\n\nconnection at least as  strongly as Agent Botelho's erroneous\n\ntestimony had.\n\n          Abreu  has  said  nothing  to  suggest  that  Agent\n\nBotelho's  misstatements  were  intentional  and  perjurious.\n\nIndeed,   given   the   relative   insignificance   of  these\n\nmisstatements and  the lack of resulting  prejudice to Abreu,\n\nAbreu's allegation of perjury strains credulity.\n\n          A  showing  of   prejudice  to  the  defendant   is\n\nnecessary before  an indictment  may be dismissed  because of\n\nerrors in grand jury proceedings.  United States v. Valencia-\r                                                                         \n\nLucena, 925 F.2d  506, 511 (1st Cir. 1991).   Where, as here,\r                  \n\nthe defendant  already has been convicted,  an indictment may\n\nbe  dismissed  only  on account  of  egregious  prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct.  United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073,\r                                                         \n\n1088  (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  492 U.S. 910  (1989).  Since\r                                          \n\nthere  was  no   prejudice  here,  and  no  evidence  of  any\n\nprosecutorial  misconduct  at  all,  there was  no  basis  to\n\ndismiss the indictment, in whole or in part.\n\n          Sufficiency of the evidence of firearms offenses \r                                                                      \n\n          In his May 24, 1993 amendment to his   2255 motion,\n\nAbreu argued  that the  evidence was insufficient  to convict\n\nhim  on Counts  XIII and XIV  of the indictment.   Count XIII\n\ncharged him with using a firearm  during and in relation to a\n\n                             -4-\r\n\ndrug trafficking crime; Count XIV charged him with possession\n\nof  an unregistered shotgun.   In his brief  on appeal, Abreu\n\nobjects  that  the district  court  failed  to address  these\n\nclaims in its dismissal order.\n\n          Both of these sufficiency-of-the-evidence arguments\n\nwere raised by Abreu  and squarely rejected by this  court in\n\nAbreu's direct appeal from his conviction.  Abreu, supra, 952\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  at 1466 (Count XIII),  1469 (Count XIV).   Abreu cannot\n\nrelitigate them  collaterally in  a    2255  motion.   United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Michaud, 901 F.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir. 1990).  \r                             \n\n          In  light  of our  rulings  on  direct appeal,  any\n\nfailure by  the district court  to consider these  claims was\n\ninconsequential.  We  note, in any  event, that the  district\n\ncourt  did state  in its  dismissal order  that it  would not\n\nconsider  claims already  rejected  by this  court on  direct\n\nappeal.\n\n          Abreu also  objects that whereas he  was charged in\n\nCounts XIII  and XIV with  offenses involving a  shotgun with\n\nserial  number  145266,  the government  submitted  a written\n\nstatement  of a police officer  to the effect  that a shotgun\n\nbearing serial number 48084 had been test fired and was found\n\nto  be in  operating  condition.    Abreu contends  that  the\n\ngovernment   should  have  been   required  to  explain  this\n\nadditional  shotgun,  and  that  the  discrepancy  in  serial\n\n                             -5-\r\n\nnumbers  requires  that his  conviction  on  those counts  be\n\nvacated.\n\n          We agree  with the government that  in essence this\n\nis merely another, precluded attack on the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence  to  convict on  Counts XIII  and  XIV.   The police\n\nofficer's statement,  moreover, only concerned  the shotgun's\n\noperability.  Any discrepancy  as to serial numbers therefore\n\ndid  not  detract from  the  government's  evidence regarding\n\nAbreu's possession or use of the shotgun numbered 145266.  In\n\nany event, the government  points out in its brief  on appeal\n\nthat before  trial the  government  provided Abreu's  counsel\n\nwith  a  corrected  statement  by the  same  police  officer,\n\ntestifying to the operability of shotgun number 145266.\n\n          Ineffective assistance of counsel\r                                                       \n\n          Abreu's final challenge is to the district  court's\n\ndismissal of  his claim of ineffective  assistance of counsel\n\nat  trial.  In his   2255  motion, Abreu claimed that counsel\n\nwas  ineffective  for  opposing Abreu's  desire  to  testify;\n\nfailing to  pursue an evidentiary hearing;  failing to inform\n\nAbreu  of the  evidence against him;  and failing  to provide\n\nAbreu  with copies of documents, such as grand jury notes and\n\ntranscripts  and  exculpatory  materials the  government  was\n\n                             -6-\r\n\nrequired to provide to  the defense under Brady  v. Maryland,\r                                                                        \n\n373 U.S. 83 (1963).   \n\n          To succeed on an ineffective assistance of  counsel\n\nclaim, a  defendant must show (1)  that counsel's performance\n\nwas  deficient,   falling  below  an  objective  standard  of\n\nreasonableness, and (2)  that counsel's deficient performance\n\nprejudiced the defense because, but for counsel's errors, the\n\nresult of the trial would have been different.  Strickland v.\r                                                                      \n\nWashington,  466 U.S.  668, 687-88  (1984); Murchu  v. United\r                                                                         \n\nStates, 926 F.2d 50,  58 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  112 S.Ct.\r                                                             \n\n99 (1991).\n\n          With regard to counsel's failure to permit Abreu to\n\ntestify  --  the point  upon  which Abreu  puts  the greatest\n\nemphasis  --  Abreu has  said  nothing  to suggest  that  his\n\nfailure to testify prejudiced his defense in any way.  He has\n\nnever  specified what  he would  have said  that  he believes\n\nwould have turned the tide in his favor.  Indeed, as both the\n\ndistrict court  and the  government note, Abreu  alleged that\n\nwhen  Abreu  asked  his  counsel  about  testifying,  counsel\n\nresponded, \"What are you going to say?\"  Apparently Abreu did\n\nnot  inform counsel then, and he has shed no further light on\n\nthe question since.\n\n          In addition,  Abreu  has offered  nothing  to  cast\n\ndoubt on the district court's finding that Abreu's failure to\n\ntestify  was  a tactical  decision.   \"[T]actical  decisions,\n\n                             -7-\r\n\nwhether wise or  unwise, successful  or unsuccessful,  cannot\n\nordinarily  form   the  basis  of  a   claim  of  ineffective\n\nassistance.\"   United States v. Ortiz Oliveras, 717 F.2d 1, 3\r                                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1983).  Furthermore, given the apparent strength of\n\nthe government's  evidence, we  have no  reason to  doubt the\n\ndistrict court's judgment that, whatever the eventual outcome\n\nof the trial, this tactical decision was a wise one.\n\n          With regard to the other allegations of ineffective\n\nassistance raised  briefly in Abreu's    2255 motion  -- that\n\ncounsel  failed to  provide Abreu  with copies  of documents,\n\nincluding  grand  jury   notes  and  transcripts   and  Brady\r                                                                         \n\nmaterials;  failed to  pursue  an  evidentiary  hearing;  and\n\nfailed to inform Abreu  of the evidence against him  -- Abreu\n\nsimilarly does not explain how  these alleged errors, if they\n\noccurred,  prejudiced his defense.  He  does argue that these\n\nerrors prevented  him from  raising at  trial -- rather  than\n\nlater --  the matters  of Agent Botelho's  allegedly perjured\n\ntestimony before  the grand jury  and the discrepancy  in the\n\nshotgun's serial number on the original  report of the police\n\noperability test.   As  we have already  ruled, however,  any\n\nsuch challenges would have been meritless.  \n\n          In his brief  on appeal, Abreu  raises a number  of\n\nadditional  allegations of  ineffective assistance  that were\n\nnot  contained in  his    2255  motion  or in  the  amendment\n\nthereto.  He  alleges that  counsel failed to  object to  the\n\n                             -8-\r\n\ndistrict   court's  participation   in  the   examination  of\n\nwitnesses;  failed  to object  to  the  admission of  certain\n\ncocaine evidence; failed to  object to jury instructions; and\n\nfailed to object to the prosecutor's closing argument.\n\n          Having failed  to present these allegations, in the\n\ncontext  of a claim of ineffective  assistance of counsel, to\n\nthe district court  in the first instance, Abreu is precluded\n\nfrom raising them for  the first time on appeal.  Dziurgot v.\r                                                                      \n\nLuther, 897 F.2d 1222, 1224 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                  \n\n          In  any  event,  each  of the  practices  to  which\n\nAbreu's  counsel failed to object was cited in Abreu's direct\n\nappeal, and  this court affirmed  the district court  on each\n\npoint.  Abreu, supra, 952  F.2d at 1470-72.  Although  we did\r                                \n\nmake clear in  Abreu that, in the  absence of contemporaneous\r                                \n\nobjections, our  review was only  for plain  error, id.,  our\r                                                                  \n\ndiscussion  there suggested that  these were  not troublesome\n\nissues.   In light of that discussion, Abreu has said nothing\n\nto suggest that counsel's  failure to object on any  of these\n\npoints may have affected  the outcome of either his  trial or\n\nhis appeal.\n\n                         Conclusion \r                                               \n\n          We  have  considered   each  of  Abreu's  remaining\n\narguments and find them meritless.\n\n                             -9-\r\n\n          The district court's dismissal of Abreu's motion to\n\nvacate sentence under 28 U.S.C.   2255 is affirmed.\r                                                              \n\n                             -10-\r\n",
