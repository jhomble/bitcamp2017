The plaintiff consulting company, as\n\npart of its services to domestic and international clients, uses\n\ncopyrighted training materials of several hundred pages geared\n\ntoward     teaching   techniques      for    effective    communication     and\n\nnegotiation within the workplace. It sued a competitor saying that\n\nthe competitor had copied and used training materials substantially\n\nsimilar to plaintiff's in violation of the copyright laws.\n\n            This    case   concerns    the    proper     application   of   two\n\ndefinitional criteria for what subject matter is eligible for\n\ncopyright protection.       The first is the originality requirement,\n\nsee 17 U.S.C. § 102(a) (\"Copyright protection subsists . . . in\n\noriginal works of authorship . . . .\"), which is a constitutional\n\nprerequisite for copyright protection.          See Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v.\n\nRural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 351 (1991).             The second is the\n\nstatutory codification of the exclusion from copyright protection\n\nfor processes and systems.         See 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) (\"In no case\n\ndoes copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend\n\nto any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation,\n\nconcept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which\n\nit is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such\n\nwork.\").      Indeed, the statutory restriction in § 102(b) is a\n\ncodification of \"[t]he most fundamental axiom of copyright law\n\n. . . that '[n]o author may copyright his ideas or the facts he\n\nnarrates.'\"        Feist, 499 U.S. at 344-45 (second alteration in\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\foriginal) (quoting Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.,\n\n471 U.S. 539, 556 (1985)).\n\n           Here, the district court considered the plaintiff's works\n\n\"largely noncopyrightable because they are devoted to describing a\n\nprocess or because they are not original.\" Situation Mgmt. Sys. v.\n\nASP Consulting Group, 535 F. Supp. 2d 231, 240 (D. Mass. 2008).              To\n\nreach this conclusion, the district court treated the originality\n\nrequirement as functionally equivalent to a novelty standard.\n\nE.g., id. at 243 (finding that the plaintiff's work \"does not\n\nconstitute original expression because it is merely a summary of\n\ncommon-sense     communication   skills\").        It   read   the   statutory\n\nexclusion of processes and systems from copyright protection as\n\nbarring protection for descriptions of processes and systems.\n\nE.g., id. at 240 (finding the plaintiff's works largely unprotected\n\nby   copyright    because   \"they    focus   on   concepts    and    teach   a\n\nnoncopyrightable process\").      The court also found the plaintiff's\n\nworks noncopyrightable based upon its own subjective assessment of\n\nthe works' creative worth.          E.g., id. at 239 (describing SMS's\n\nworks as \"fodder for sardonic workplace humor\" and as \"aggressively\n\nvapid\").\n\n           A brief from amici, an industry association along with\n\nanother company that produces corporate training materials, argues\n\nthat the district court's conclusions have implications far beyond\n\nthe dispute between the parties to this case and put at risk the\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\flegitimate copyright expectations of the more than $100 billion\n\nmanagement training industry.          Indeed, amici argue that under the\n\ndistrict court's approach, those in the training industry would\n\nhave difficulty obtaining effective copyright protection for their\n\nworks.    We vacate the district court's finding of noninfringement\n\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           For     more     than   thirty    years,    plaintiff   Situation\n\nManagement Systems, Inc. (\"SMS\") has provided consulting services\n\naimed at improving employee communication and negotiation skills\n\nwithin the workplace.        As part of its services, SMS has developed\n\na series of training materials focused on teaching effective\n\ncommunication and negotiation techniques.              Companies buy these\n\nmaterials from SMS and use them in employee training workshops.\n\nSMS typically charges its clients $200 to $250 per participant for\n\nthe use of its materials.          SMS's clients include Anheuser-Busch,\n\nGeneral   Mills,    NASA,    Pfizer,    Procter   &   Gamble,   Verizon,   and\n\ncompanies abroad.\n\n           A number of SMS employees, including Dane Harwood and\n\nAlexander Moore, left SMS after Sharon Malouf acquired the company\n\nthrough bankruptcy proceedings in 2001.               Following the end of\n\nHarwood's noncompete period, Harwood and Moore, along with an\n\nexecutive from a former European sublicensee of SMS, Alon Shklarek,\n\nfounded defendant ASP. Consulting LLC (\"ASP\") in 2003.             ASP offers\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\ftraining programs similar to SMS's, and the two compete for the\n\nsame customers.       ASP also has a series of training materials that\n\nfocus on the same subject matter and teach similar communication\n\nand negotiation strategies as SMS's.\n\n            SMS claims ASP infringed its copyright in three of SMS's\n\ntraining workbooks: Positive Power & Influence (\"PPI\"), Positive\n\nNegotiation       Program   (\"PNP\"),    and    Promoting      and   Implementing\n\nInnovation (\"PII\").         PPI was first published in 1976 and is\n\ncurrently    in    its   fourth   edition.      PPI    is   SMS's   most   widely\n\ncirculated work and generates approximately seventy-five percent of\n\nSMS's revenues.       More than a quarter million people have taken the\n\nPPI course.       PNP, now in its third edition, was first published in\n\n1978 and accounts for approximately fifteen percent of SMS's\n\nrevenues.     PII was first published in 1993 and is a much smaller\n\npart of SMS's business than the other two works at issue.                   SMS's\n\nworks   contain      hundreds     of   pages   of     text,   flowcharts,     and\n\nillustrations teaching techniques for communication and negotiation\n\nwithin the workplace.\n\n            This suit claims infringement by three of defendant ASP's\n\nworkbooks:     Communicating       2    Influence      (\"C2I\"),      Negotiating\n\nSuccessful Agreements (\"NSA\"), and Championing Ideas (\"CI\").                 SMS\n\nclaims that ASP's C2I infringes its copyright to PPI, that NSA\n\ninfringes PNP, and that CI infringes PII.             ASP's works address the\n\nsame topics as SMS's.        Considering the circumstances under which\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fASP developed its materials, the district court found that this\n\nsimilarity was no coincidence. Situation Mgmt., 535 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n235.   In particular, Harwood, Moore, and Shklarek each had access\n\nto SMS's works prior to forming ASP; Harwood even kept copies of\n\nSMS's works in the attic of his home after he left SMS.                     And\n\nHarwood and Moore were intimately familiar with SMS's works, having\n\nauthored several editions of PPI, PNP, and PII while working at\n\nSMS.   Moreover, Harwood and Moore together authored each of the\n\nallegedly infringing works relatively quickly after forming ASP.\n\nFor example, they prepared a version of C2I over a period of six to\n\nthirty-four days.\n\n           On September 24, 2003, one of SMS's European licensees\n\ncontacted Malouf to tell her that ASP's new C2I program was the\n\nsame as SMS's PPI.    Malouf then visited ASP's website and read a\n\nbrief description of C2I, which she found strikingly similar to the\n\nPPI program.    Malouf contacted ASP and asked to see ASP's written\n\nmaterials so that she could assess whether SMS had a claim against\n\nASP for copyright infringement.      SMS and ASP were unable to reach\n\nan agreement regarding the conditions under which Malouf could\n\ninspect ASP's works, and Malouf did not view ASP's works before\n\nfiling suit.\n\n           On   December   28,   2005,    based   upon   the   tip   from   the\n\nEuropean licensee and the information on ASP's website, Malouf\n\nbelieved that SMS had a viable claim of copyright infringement and\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fsued ASP in federal district court in New Hampshire, where SMS has\n\nits    principal    place     of   business.         That    suit   was   ultimately\n\ndismissed on August 15, 2006 for lack of personal jurisdiction over\n\nASP.\n\n            SMS then sued ASP in the District of Massachusetts on\n\nSeptember 1, 2006.        The district court denied the parties cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment, and the parties agreed to treat the\n\nmatter as a case stated.              The district court held a hearing on\n\nASP's liability for copyright infringement on November 7, 2007. At\n\nthe hearing, SMS stated that it would seek statutory damages, not\n\nits actual damages.           SMS had sued ASP before it had incurred any\n\nsubstantial      actual       damages     as    a   result     of   ASP's    alleged\n\ninfringement.      In its post-hearing briefing, SMS explained that it\n\nwas seeking statutory damages of $75,000 for each infringing work,\n\ninstead of actual damages, because ASP's \"sales were apparently\n\nlimited    (to     just   a     few     customers)    but     [its]   conduct    was\n\ndeliberate.\"\n\n            The district court found that ASP had copied SMS's works.\n\nIt recognized that \"[i]t is undisputed that Harwood and Moore had\n\nintimate familiarity with SMS's programs because they helped write\n\nthem\" and that \"Harwood, Moore, and at least one other ASP employee\n\nhad access to SMS's works during the period when they generated the\n\naccused works.\"       Situation Mgmt., 535 F. Supp. 2d at 235.                  This\n\nlevel of access to and familiarity with SMS's works, coupled with\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f\"[t]he fact that ASP's works address the same topics as SMS's\" and\n\nthe speed with which ASP produced its own works, indicated \"that\n\nthe creators of ASP's programs used SMS's materials in creating\n\ntheir own.\"     Id.\n\n           The    district   court,    however,    determined     that    ASP's\n\ncopying   was    not   actionable     because     ASP's   works    were    not\n\nsubstantially similar to the copyright protected aspects of SMS's\n\nworks.    It found that \"the works at issue are so dominated by\n\nnonprotectable material that it is impossible to reduce the work to\n\na copyrightable essence or structure.\"          Id. at 240.     Accordingly,\n\nit held that the copyright protection for SMS's works \"is limited\n\nto little more than [their] original text and formatting.\"               Id. at\n\n241.\n\n           Having narrowly defined the scope of SMS's copyright\n\nprotection and excluded from consideration a great deal of SMS's\n\nmaterials, the district court then evaluated the similarities\n\nbetween the limited universe of SMS's and ASP's works it thought\n\nwas subject to copyright protection. The district court recognized\n\na \"few minor incidents of verbatim repetition\" between C2I and PPI.\n\nId. at 244.      But after excising from consideration \"much of the\n\nsubstance\" of PPI as \"simply not copyrightable,\" id. at 242, it\n\nfound that C2I and PPI \"as a whole are not substantially similar,\"\n\nid. at 244.       Likewise, it held that CI \"successfully avoided\n\ninfringement\" of PII because \"[t]here is no verbatim replication of\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fwords or phrases, and the graphical depictions are quite distinct.\"\n\nId. at 246.    Finally, it found \"no structural similarity\" between\n\nNSA and PNP, dismissing instances of verbatim copying as \"few and\n\nfar between\" and \"of minimal importance.\"        Id. at 248.   Finding no\n\nsubstantial similarity between the aspects of SMS's and ASP's works\n\nthat it considered protectable, the district court entered a\n\njudgment of noninfringement.      Id. at 249.\n\n            SMS   timely   appealed.     The   Association   of   Learning\n\nProviders, an industry association serving training companies, and\n\nBlanchard Training and Development, Inc., who like SMS and ASP\n\nsells corporate training materials, filed a brief as amici curiae\n\nin support of reversal.\n\n            The district court denied ASP's request for attorneys'\n\nfees as the prevailing party in a copyright suit under 17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 505.    ASP cross-appeals that decision, arguing that SMS brought\n\nthis \"expensive, unmeritorious litigation\" to drive ASP out of\n\nbusiness.     The cost of defending this suit, ASP represents, has\n\nrendered it insolvent.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            \"In a case stated, the parties waive trial and present\n\nthe case to the court on the undisputed facts in the pre-trial\n\nrecord.   The court is then entitled to 'engage in a certain amount\n\nof factfinding, including the drawing of inferences.'\" TLT Constr.\n\nCorp. v. RI, Inc., 484 F.3d 130, 135 n.6 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fUnited Paperworkers Int'l Union, Local 14 v. Int'l Paper Co., 64\n\nF.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1995)).                   We review the district court's\n\nfactual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\n\nBunch v. W.R. Grace & Co., 555 F.3d 1, 3 n.4 (1st Cir. 2009).                        Of\n\ncourse,      a    district    court's     use    of    incorrect     relevant     legal\n\nstandards will lead to reversal unless that use had no prejudicial\n\neffects.\n\n                 To establish copyright infringement, the plaintiff must\n\nprove two elements: \"(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2)\n\ncopying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\"\n\nFeist, 499 U.S. at 361; accord Mag Jewelry Co. v. Cherokee, Inc.,\n\n496 F.3d 108, 114 (1st Cir. 2007).                ASP does not dispute that SMS\n\nowns    a     valid    copyright     interest         in   its    works,   and    SMS's\n\ncertificates of copyright are prima facie evidence of its ownership\n\nof valid copyright interests in its works, see Johnson v. Gordon,\n\n409 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                 Our analysis, therefore, focuses entirely on whether the\n\ndistrict court properly applied the second element of the Feist\n\ntest.       That prong \"itself involves two steps: the plaintiff must\n\nshow (a) that the defendant actually copied the work as a factual\n\nmatter, . . . and (b) that the defendant's 'copying                              of the\n\ncopyrighted        material    was   so    extensive       that    it   rendered    the\n\ninfringing and copyrighted works \"substantially similar.\"'\" T-Peg,\n\nInc. v. Vt. Timber Works, Inc., 459 F.3d 97, 108 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f(citations omitted) (quoting Johnson, 409 F.3d at 18).                        On appeal,\n\nASP wisely does not contest the district court's finding of actual\n\ncopying,    so   our     analysis       centers     on       the    district      court's\n\napplication of the test for substantial similarity.\n\n            The burden is on the plaintiff to prove substantial\n\nsimilarity between the plaintiff's and defendant's works.                          T-Peg,\n\n459 F.3d at 108.        Substantial similarity exists \"if a reasonable,\n\nordinary    observer,       upon     examination       of    the    two   works,    would\n\n'conclude    that       the     defendant       unlawfully          appropriated        the\n\nplaintiff's protectable expression.'\" Id. at 112 (quoting Johnson,\n\n409 F.3d at 18).\n\n            At   oral    argument,       counsel       for    ASP    argued      that   the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion should best be understood as being that\n\nthe amount of copying done was so small as to be de minimis.                            See\n\nSituation    Mgmt.,     535     F.    Supp.    2d   at      244    (\"Such   de    minimis\n\nduplication does not amount to infringement.\").                     Even if that were\n\naccurate, it not sufficient to salvage the district court's finding\n\nof noninfringement, however, for it ignores the fact that the court\n\nfirst excluded from consideration of the works copied the bulk of\n\nSMS's   materials      on     the    grounds    that     it   was    not    subject      to\n\nprotection at all.          If the court erred in that exclusion, then it\n\nused the wrong measure for substantial similarity.\n\n            Further, the de minimis copying doctrine in copyright\n\ndoes not operate as broadly as ASP suggests.                  The extent of copying\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\ffrom the plaintiff's work is, of course, relevant to the analysis\n\nof   substantial   similarity.        If     such   a   small   amount    of   the\n\nplaintiff's work is copied that the two works cannot be said to be\n\nsubstantially similar, then no infringement results.1 See 2 Nimmer\n\n& Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright, § 8.01[G], at 8-26 (2008) (\"[F]or\n\nsimilarity to be substantial, and hence actionable, it must apply\n\nto more than simply a de minimis fragment.\").                    \"Used in this\n\nfashion, 'de minimis copying' represents simply the converse of\n\nsubstantial similarity.\"        Id.\n\n           This statement should not be misunderstood.                   That the\n\ncopying involved only a small portion of the plaintiff's work does\n\nnot by itself make the copying permissible.              Indeed, \"even if the\n\nsimilar material is quantitatively small, if it is qualitatively\n\nimportant,   the   trier   of    fact      may   properly   find    substantial\n\nsimilarity.\"   4 id. § 13.03[A][2][a], at 13-55.                As a result, de\n\nminimis copying is best viewed not as a separate defense to\n\ncopyright infringement but rather as a statement regarding the\n\nstrength of the plaintiff's proof of substantial similarity.2\n\n\n      1\n          The extent of copying is also relevant to the fair use\ndefense, where one factor that determines the applicability of the\ndefense is \"the amount and substantiality of the portion used in\nrelation to the copyrighted work as a whole.\" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3).\nASP has not raised a fair use defense in this case.\n      2\n          Further, commentators have viewed the de minimis copying\ndoctrine as relating to instances of fragmented literal similarity,\napplicable only where \"no more than a line, or a paragraph, or a\npage or chapter of the copyrighted work has been appropriated.\" 4\nNimmer & Nimmer, supra, § 13.03[A][2], at 13-53; see also id.\n\n                                      -12-\n\fWhere substantial similarity exists and the fair use doctrine, as\n\nhere,   is    inapplicable,       \"the    overwhelming     thrust       of    authority\n\nupholds liability even under circumstances in which the use of the\n\ncopyrighted work is of minimal consequence.\"                   2 Nimmer & Nimmer,\n\nsupra, § 8.01[G], at 8-26.\n\n              Here, the district court correctly recognized that the de\n\nminimis nature of the copying could lead to a finding of no\n\nsubstantial similarity.           See Situation Mgmt., 535 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n244.    But its finding that the ASP's copying was not actionable\n\nbecause     of   its    de   minimis     nature    was   based    on    its    improper\n\nexclusion from consideration of large portions of SMS's works.\n\n              The district court also correctly stated the test for\n\nsubstantial      similarity,      but    then     misapplied     it.     Substantial\n\nsimilarity \"focuses not on every aspect of the copyrighted work,\n\nbut    on    those     'aspects   of     the     plaintiff's     work    [that]     are\n\nprotectible under copyright laws and whether whatever copying took\n\nplace appropriated those [protected] elements.'\"                   T-Peg, 459 F.3d\n\nat 112 (alterations in original) (quoting Johnson, 409 F.3d at 19).\n\nAfter identifying the aspects of the plaintiff's work that are\n\nprotected by copyright, substantial similarity is assessed by\n\n\n§ 13.03[A][1][e], at 13-52 to -53 (discussing substantial\nsimilarity under the heading \"Similarity of Limited Segments\"). On\nthe facts of this case, however, where SMS has identified hundreds\nof instances of verbatim copying and rough paraphrasing in ASP's\nworks and has also alleged infringement through the overall\nstructure and arrangement of ASP's works, that aspect of the de\nminimis doctrine simply does not arise.\n\n                                          -13-\n\fcomparing the protected elements of the plaintiff's work as a whole\n\nagainst the defendant's work.             Johnson, 409 F.3d at 18.              In\n\nperforming the substantial similarity analysis, a court should be\n\ncareful not to over-dissect the plaintiff's work, causing it to\n\nignore the plaintiff's protectable expression.           See CMM Cable Rep,\n\nInc. v. Ocean Coast Props., Inc., 97 F.3d 1504, 1515 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (recognizing \"the potential 'danger . . . that courts . . .\n\nwill so \"dissect\" the work as to classify all its elements as\n\nunprotectable    .    .   .   [thereby   possibly]   blind[ing    it]    to    the\n\nexpressiveness       of   their   ensemble'\"   (alterations      in   original)\n\n(quoting J.C. Ginsburg, Four Reasons and a Paradox: The Manifest\n\nSuperiority of Copyright over Sui Generis Protection of Computer\n\nSoftware, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 2259, 2561 (1994))).\n\n            Here, the district court erred in determining which\n\naspects of SMS's works were subject to copyright protection.                  This\n\nerror prevented it from meaningfully analyzing the similarities\n\nbetween SMS's and ASP's works, caused prejudice, and requires\n\nreversal.    We explain.\n\nA.          The Originality Requirement\n\n            The originality requirement for copyright protection is\n\nnot particularly rigorous.           \"Original, as the term is used in\n\ncopyright, means only that the work was independently created by\n\nthe author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it\n\npossesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.\"                Feist, 499\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fU.S. at 345.   \"[T]he requisite level of creativity is extremely\n\nlow; even a slight amount will suffice.\"    Id.\n\n          Originality under copyright -- unlike the intellectual\n\nproperty protection provided under patent law, see 35 U.S.C.\n\n§ 102 -- \"does not signify novelty,\" Feist, 499 U.S. at 345.    It\n\nmerely means that the author did not himself copy his work from\n\nanother source.   Indeed, even a work that is identical to another\n\nis original for purposes of copyright protection so long as the\n\nauthor created it independently.    Id. at 345-46.\n\n          Similarly, a work's entitlement to copyright protection\n\ndoes not depend in any way upon the court's subjective assessment\n\nof its creative worth.   See Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing\n\nCo., 188 U.S. 239, 251 (1903) (\"It would be a dangerous undertaking\n\nfor persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final\n\njudges of the worth of pictorial illustrations . . . .\"); see also\n\nFeist, 499 U.S. at 345 (recognizing that the \"vast majority of\n\nworks\" possess the requisite \"creative spark\" for originality, \"'no\n\nmatter how crude, humble, or obvious' it might be\" (quoting 1\n\nNimmer & Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 1.08[C][1] (1990))).\n\n          Here, the district court stated the correct standard for\n\noriginality under copyright law, see Situation Mgmt., 535 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 238, but misapplied it.       The district court erroneously\n\ntreated copyright law's originality requirement as functionally\n\nequivalent to a novelty standard.   For example, the district court\n\n\n                               -15-\n\ffound SMS's works unoriginal because, in its view, they are \"filled\n\nwith generalizations, platitudes, and observations of the obvious,\"\n\nid. at 239, contain \"not-so-stunning revelation[s],\" id. at 240,\n\nand   teach,     \"[a]t   their    creative      zenith,   .   .    .   common-sense\n\ncommunication skills,\" id. at 241.\n\n            Moreover, the district court's originality analysis was\n\nobviously tainted by its own subjective assessment of the works'\n\ncreative worth.      Its assessment of originality displayed nothing\n\nbut pejorative disdain for the value of SMS's works.                    E.g., id. at\n\n239   (\"[The     plaintiff's     works]   are    dominated    by       unprotectable\n\nmaterial.      These works exemplify the sorts of training programs\n\nthat serve as fodder for sardonic workplace humor that has given\n\nrise to the popular television show The Office and the movie Office\n\nSpace.    They are aggressively vapid -- hundreds of pages filled\n\nwith generalizations, platitudes, and observations of the obvious.\"\n\n(footnote omitted)).       Yet neither the works' absolute novelty nor\n\ntheir creative value determines whether they are original for\n\npurposes of copyright protection.\n\n            On the record evidence and applying the correct standard,\n\nSMS's    works    easily   satisfy    the       originality       requirement   for\n\ncopyright protection.          ASP never argued that SMS had copied its\n\nworks from another source, making them unoriginal to SMS.                       And\n\nSMS's works, which include text, flowcharts, and illustrations\n\nexplaining techniques for communication and negotiation, certainly\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fdemonstrate the requisite \"minimal degree of creativity,\" Feist,\n\n499 U.S. at 345, for copyright protection.            Thus, the district\n\ncourt erroneously excluded large portions of SMS's works from\n\nconsideration under its substantial similarity analysis based upon\n\nits misapplication of the originality requirement.           This mistake\n\nmattered to the outcome of the case.               We hold that SMS has\n\nsatisfied the originality requirement for the three works in\n\nquestion.\n\nB.          The Statutory Exclusion for Processes and Systems\n\n            The   copyright   statute   excludes    from   protection   the\n\nprocesses and systems described in a work.         See 17 U.S.C. § 102(b).\n\nWhen Congress revised the copyright code in 1976, it recognized\n\nthat \"[§] 102(b) in no way enlarges or contracts the scope of\n\ncopyright protection under the present law. Its purpose is to\n\nrestate, in the context of the new single Federal system of\n\ncopyright, that the basic dichotomy between expression and idea\n\nremains unchanged.\"      H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, reprinted in 1976\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5670 (1976).\n\n            That idea/expression dichotomy is the \"most fundamental\n\naxiom of copyright law,\" Feist, 499 U.S. at 344, and \"assures\n\nauthors the right to their original expression, but encourages\n\nothers to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by\n\na work,\" id. at 349-50.       That is, descriptions of a process or\n\nsystem are copyrightable, but the underlying process or system\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fitself is not.      See Matthews v. Freedman, 157 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (\"[C]opyright protects the original expressions of ideas but\n\nnot the ideas expressed.\").             At least one circuit court has\n\nrejected     as    \"absurd\"   the    argument     that   management    training\n\nmaterials contain no protectable expression because they teach a\n\nnoncopyrightable process.           See Kepner-Tregoe, Inc. v. Leadership\n\nSoftware, Inc., 12 F.3d 527, 534 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\n            Thus, to the extent that SMS's works teach a process or\n\nsystem for effective communication and negotiation, others may\n\nfreely describe that process or system by using their own original\n\nexpression.       But others may not appropriate SMS's expression when\n\ndescribing that process or system.\n\n            Here, the district court improperly denied copyright\n\nprotection to large portions of SMS's works because it, in an error\n\nof law, found \"they focus on concepts and teach a noncopyrightable\n\nprocess.\"    Situation Mgmt., 535 F. Supp. 2d at 240; see also id. at\n\n241 (finding that \"the structure or essence of SMS's works is not\n\ncopyrightable\" because, unlike a work of fiction that has a plot\n\nand characters, they merely discuss processes and ideas). The fact\n\nthat SMS's works describe processes or systems does not make their\n\nexpression    noncopyrightable.         See     Feist,   499   U.S.   at   350-51\n\n(holding that a factual compilation may be entitled to copyright\n\nprotection if it features an original selection or arrangement of\n\nfacts   even       though     the    underlying     facts      themselves    are\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fnoncopyrightable).        SMS's creative choices in describing those\n\nprocesses and systems, including the works' overall arrangement and\n\nstructure,     are    subject    to   copyright      protection.    See     id.\n\n(recognizing    that    the     original   selection    and   arrangement    of\n\nnoncopyrightable elements is entitled to copyright protection).\n\nThe district court's analysis did what we cautioned against in CMM\n\nCable, 97 F.3d at 1515: it lost sight of the expressiveness of the\n\nworks as a whole by focusing too closely on their noncopyrightable\n\nelements.\n\n            Because    the    original     selection    and   arrangement   of\n\nnoncopyrightable elements is itself copyrightable, the district\n\ncourt also erred in limiting the narrow copyright protection it\n\nallowed for SMS's works \"to little more than [their] original text\n\nand formatting.\"      Situtation Mgmt., 535 F. Supp. 2d at 241.           There\n\nare numerous ways to teach the concepts and processes disclosed in\n\nSMS's works and so SMS need not show \"'near identity' between the\n\nworks at issue\" to prove copyright infringement.              Concrete Mach.\n\nCo. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., 843 F.2d 600, 606 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (quoting Sid & Marty Krofft Television Prods., Inc. v.\n\nMcDonald's Corp., 562 F.2d 1157, 1167 (9th Cir. 1977)).              This is\n\nnot a situation where the idea and expression have merged because\n\n\"there is essentially only one way to express an idea,\" making\n\ncopying of the expression permissible.            Id.   Because of its legal\n\nerror,   the    court's      resulting     factual    conclusions   regarding\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fsubstantial similarity are clearly erroneous. These determinations\n\nare vacated and may be determined at a new trial.\n\n                                  III.\n\n           The district court's analysis of substantial similarity\n\nimproperly excluded from consideration large portions of SMS's\n\nworks under the mistaken belief that they are unoriginal or a\n\nnoncopyrightable   process   or   system,   making   its   assessment   of\n\nsubstantial similarity clearly erroneous. We leave undisturbed the\n\ndistrict court's finding of actual copying and hold, as a matter of\n\nlaw, that SMS's works both satisfy the originality requirement for\n\ncopyright protection and are entitled to protection beyond the\n\ntextual level even though they describe processes and systems.          We\n\nleave the analysis of the question of substantial similarity\n\nbetween SMS's and ASP's works within the framework we have outlined\n\nto be addressed on remand.\n\n           We vacate the district court's finding of noninfringement\n\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nBecause we vacate the district court's finding of noninfringement,\n\nwe need not address the substance of the attorneys' fees issue\n\nraised by ASP's cross-appeal.      See 17 U.S.C. § 505 (allowing the\n\naward of fees to the prevailing party in a copyright infringement\n\nsuit).   Each party will bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\f",

It sued a competitor saying that the competitor had copied and used training materials substantially similar to plaintiff's in violation of the copyright laws.</p>\n<p>This case concerns the proper application of two definitional criteria for what subject matter is eligible for copyright protection. The first is the originality requirement, <i>see</i> 17 U.S.C. § 102(a) (\"Copyright protection subsists ... in original works of authorship ....\"), which is a constitutional prerequisite for copyright protection. <i>See </i><i>Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.,</i> 499 U.S. 340, 351, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991). The second is the statutory codification of the exclusion from copyright protection for processes and systems. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) (\"In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\"). Indeed, the statutory restriction in § 102(b) is a codification of \"[t]he most fundamental axiom of copyright law ... that `[n]o author may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates.'\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 344-45, 111 S.Ct. 1282 (second alteration in original) (quoting <i>Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.,</i> 471 U.S. 539, 556, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985)).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court considered the plaintiff's works \"largely noncopyrightable because they are devoted to describing a process or because they are not original.\" <i>Situation Mgmt. Sys. v. ASP Consulting Group,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d 231, 240 (D.Mass. 2008). To reach this conclusion, the district court treated the originality requirement as functionally equivalent to a novelty standard. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 243 (finding that the plaintiff's work \"does not constitute original expression because it is merely a summary of common-sense communication skills\"). It read the statutory exclusion of processes and systems from copyright protection as barring protection for <i>descriptions</i> of processes and systems. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 240 (finding the plaintiff's works largely unprotected by copyright because \"they focus on concepts and teach a noncopyrightable process\"). The court also found the plaintiff's works noncopyrightable based upon its own subjective assessment of the works' creative worth. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 239 (describing SMS's works as \"fodder for sardonic workplace humor\" and as \"aggressively vapid\").</p>\n<p>A brief from amici, an industry association along with another company that produces corporate training materials, argues that the district court's conclusions have implications far beyond the dispute between the parties to this case and put at risk the legitimate copyright expectations of the more than $100 billion management training industry. Indeed, amici argue that under the district court's approach, those in the training industry would have difficulty obtaining effective copyright protection for their works. We vacate the district court's finding of noninfringement and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>For more than thirty years, plaintiff Situation Management Systems, Inc. (\"SMS\") has provided consulting services aimed at improving employee communication and negotiation skills within the workplace. As part of its services, SMS has developed a series of training materials focused on teaching effective communication and negotiation techniques. Companies buy these materials from SMS and use them in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> employee training workshops. SMS typically charges its clients $200 to $250 per participant for the use of its materials. SMS's clients include Anheuser-Busch, General Mills, NASA, Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble, Verizon, and companies abroad.</p>\n<p>A number of SMS employees, including Dane Harwood and Alexander Moore, left SMS after Sharon Malouf acquired the company through bankruptcy proceedings in 2001. Following the end of Harwood's noncompete period, Harwood and Moore, along with an executive from a former European sublicensee of SMS, Alon Shklarek, founded defendant ASP. Consulting LLC (\"ASP\") in 2003. ASP offers training programs similar to SMS's, and the two compete for the same customers. ASP also has a series of training materials that focus on the same subject matter and teach similar communication and negotiation strategies as SMS's.</p>\n<p>SMS claims ASP infringed its copyright in three of SMS's training workbooks: <i>Positive Power &amp; Influence</i> (<i>\"PPI\"</i>), <i>Positive Negotiation Program</i> (<i>\"PNP\"</i>), and <i>Promoting and Implementing Innovation</i> (<i>\"PII\"</i>). <i>PPI</i> was first published in 1976 and is currently in its fourth edition. <i>PPI</i> is SMS's most widely circulated work and generates approximately seventy-five percent of SMS's revenues. More than a quarter million people have taken the <i>PPI</i> course. <i>PNP,</i> now in its third edition, was first published in 1978 and accounts for approximately fifteen percent of SMS's revenues. <i>PII</i> was first published in 1993 and is a much smaller part of SMS's business than the other two works at issue. SMS's works contain hundreds of pages of text, flowcharts, and illustrations teaching techniques for communication and negotiation within the workplace.</p>\n<p>This suit claims infringement by three of defendant ASP's workbooks: <i>Communicating 2 Influence</i> (<i>\"C2I\"</i>), <i>Negotiating Successful Agreements</i> (<i>\"NSA\"</i>), and <i>Championing Ideas</i> (<i>\"CI\"</i>). SMS claims that ASP's <i>C2I</i> infringes its copyright to <i>PPI,</i> that <i>NSA</i> infringes <i>PNP,</i> and that <i>CI</i> infringes <i>PII.</i> ASP's works address the same topics as SMS's. Considering the circumstances under which ASP developed its materials, the district court found that this similarity was no coincidence. <i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 235. In particular, Harwood, Moore, and Shklarek each had access to SMS's works prior to forming ASP; Harwood even kept copies of SMS's works in the attic of his home after he left SMS. And Harwood and Moore were intimately familiar with SMS's works, having authored several editions of <i>PPI, PNP,</i> and <i>PII</i> while working at SMS. Moreover, Harwood and Moore together authored each of the allegedly infringing works relatively quickly after forming ASP. For example, they prepared a version of <i>C2I</i> over a period of six to thirty-four days.</p>\n<p>On September 24, 2003, one of SMS's European licensees contacted Malouf to tell her that ASP's new <i>C2I</i> program was the same as SMS's <i>PPI.</i> Malouf then visited ASP's website and read a brief description of <i>C2I,</i> which she found strikingly similar to the <i>PPI</i> program. Malouf contacted ASP and asked to see ASP's written materials so that she could assess whether SMS had a claim against ASP for copyright infringement. SMS and ASP were unable to reach an agreement regarding the conditions under which Malouf could inspect ASP's works, and Malouf did not view ASP's works before filing suit.</p>\n<p>On December 28, 2005, based upon the tip from the European licensee and the information on ASP's website, Malouf believed that SMS had a viable claim of copyright infringement and sued ASP in federal district court in New Hampshire, where SMS has its principal place of business. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> That suit was ultimately dismissed on August 15, 2006 for lack of personal jurisdiction over ASP.</p>\n<p>SMS then sued ASP in the District of Massachusetts on September 1, 2006. The district court denied the parties cross-motions for summary judgment, and the parties agreed to treat the matter as a case stated. The district court held a hearing on ASP's liability for copyright infringement on November 7, 2007. At the hearing, SMS stated that it would seek statutory damages, not its actual damages. SMS had sued ASP before it had incurred any substantial actual damages as a result of ASP's alleged infringement. In its post-hearing briefing, SMS explained that it was seeking statutory damages of $75,000 for each infringing work, instead of actual damages, because ASP's \"sales were apparently limited (to just a few customers) but [its] conduct was deliberate.\"</p>\n<p>The district court found that ASP had copied SMS's works. It recognized that \"[i]t is undisputed that Harwood and Moore had intimate familiarity with SMS's programs because they helped write them\" and that \"Harwood, Moore, and at least one other ASP employee had access to SMS's works during the period when they generated the accused works.\" <i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 235. This level of access to and familiarity with SMS's works, coupled with \"[t]he fact that ASP's works address the same topics as SMS's\" and the speed with which ASP produced its own works, indicated \"that the creators of ASP's programs used SMS's materials in creating their own.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The district court, however, determined that ASP's copying was not actionable because ASP's works were not substantially similar to the copyright protected aspects of SMS's works. It found that \"the works at issue are so dominated by nonprotectable material that it is impossible to reduce the work to a copyrightable essence or structure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 240. Accordingly, it held that the copyright protection for SMS's works \"is limited to little more than [their] original text and formatting.\" <i>Id.</i> at 241.</p>\n<p>Having narrowly defined the scope of SMS's copyright protection and excluded from consideration a great deal of SMS's materials, the district court then evaluated the similarities between the limited universe of SMS's and ASP's works it thought was subject to copyright protection. The district court recognized a \"few minor incidents of verbatim repetition\" between <i>C2I</i> and <i>PPI. Id.</i> at 244. But after excising from consideration \"much of the substance\" of <i>PPI</i> as \"simply not copyrightable,\" <i>id.</i> at 242, it found that <i>C2I</i> and <i>PPI</i> \"as a whole are not substantially similar,\" <i>id.</i> at 244. Likewise, it held that <i>CI</i> \"successfully avoided infringement\" of <i>PII</i> because \"[t]here is no verbatim replication of words or phrases, and the graphical depictions are quite distinct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 246. Finally, it found \"no structural similarity\" between <i>NSA</i> and <i>PNP,</i> dismissing instances of verbatim copying as \"few and far between\" and \"of minimal importance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 248. Finding no substantial similarity between the aspects of SMS's and ASP's works that it considered protectable, the district court entered a judgment of noninfringement. <i>Id.</i> at 249.</p>\n<p>SMS timely appealed. The Association of Learning Providers, an industry association serving training companies, and Blanchard Training and Development, Inc., who like SMS and ASP sells corporate training materials, filed a brief as amici curiae in support of reversal.</p>\n<p>The district court denied ASP's request for attorneys' fees as the prevailing party in a copyright suit under 17 U.S.C. § 505. ASP cross-appeals that decision, arguing that SMS brought this \"expensive, unmeritorious <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> litigation\" to drive ASP out of business. The cost of defending this suit, ASP represents, has rendered it insolvent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>\"In a case stated, the parties waive trial and present the case to the court on the undisputed facts in the pretrial record. The court is then entitled to `engage in a certain amount of factfinding, including the drawing of inferences.'\" <i>TLT Constr. Corp. v. RI, Inc.,</i> 484 F.3d 130, 135 n. 6 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United Paperworkers Int'l Union, Local 14 v. Int'l Paper Co.,</i> 64 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1995)). We review the district court's factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <i>Bunch v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co.,</i> 555 F.3d 1, 3 n. 4 (1st Cir.2009). Of course, a district court's use of incorrect relevant legal standards will lead to reversal unless that use had no prejudicial effects.</p>\n<p>To establish copyright infringement, the plaintiff must prove two elements: \"(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282; <i>accord </i><i>Mag Jewelry Co. v. Cherokee, Inc.,</i> 496 F.3d 108, 114 (1st Cir.2007). ASP does not dispute that SMS owns a valid copyright interest in its works, and SMS's certificates of copyright are prima facie evidence of its ownership of valid copyright interests in its works, <i>see </i><i>Johnson v. Gordon,</i> 409 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Our analysis, therefore, focuses entirely on whether the district court properly applied the second element of the <i>Feist</i> test. That prong \"itself involves two steps: the plaintiff must show (a) that the defendant actually copied the work as a factual matter, ... and (b) that the defendant's `copying of the copyrighted material was so extensive that it rendered the infringing and copyrighted works \"substantially similar.'\"'\" <i>T-Peg, Inc. v. Vt. Timber Works, Inc.,</i> 459 F.3d 97, 108 (1st Cir.2006) (citations omitted) (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18). On appeal, ASP wisely does not contest the district court's finding of actual copying, so our analysis centers on the district court's application of the test for substantial similarity.</p>\n<p>The burden is on the plaintiff to prove substantial similarity between the plaintiff's and defendant's works. <i>T-Peg,</i> 459 F.3d at 108. Substantial similarity exists \"if a reasonable, ordinary observer, upon examination of the two works, would `conclude that the defendant unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff's protectable expression.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 112 (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18).</p>\n<p>At oral argument, counsel for ASP argued that the district court's conclusion should best be understood as being that the amount of copying done was so small as to be de minimis. <i>See </i><i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 244 (\"Such de minimis duplication does not amount to infringement.\"). Even if that were accurate, it not sufficient to salvage the district court's finding of noninfringement, however, for it ignores the fact that the court first excluded from consideration of the works copied the bulk of SMS's materials on the grounds that it was not subject to protection at all. If the court erred in that exclusion, then it used the wrong measure for substantial similarity.</p>\n<p>Further, the de minimis copying doctrine in copyright does not operate as broadly as ASP suggests. The extent of copying from the plaintiff's work is, of course, relevant to the analysis of substantial similarity. If such a small amount of the plaintiff's work is copied that the two works cannot be said to be substantially <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> similar, then no infringement results.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See</i> 2 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright,</i> § 8.01[G], at 8-26 (2008) (\"[F]or similarity to be substantial, and hence actionable, it must apply to more than simply a <i>de minimis</i> fragment.\"). \"Used in this fashion, `<i>de minimis</i> copying' represents simply the converse of substantial similarity.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This statement should not be misunderstood. That the copying involved only a small portion of the plaintiff's work does not by itself make the copying permissible. Indeed, \"even if the similar material is quantitatively small, if it is qualitatively important, the trier of fact may properly find substantial similarity.\" 4 <i>id.</i> § 13.03[A][2][a], at 13-55. As a result, de minimis copying is best viewed not as a separate defense to copyright infringement but rather as a statement regarding the strength of the plaintiff's proof of substantial similarity.<sup>[2]</sup> Where substantial similarity exists and the fair use doctrine, as here, is inapplicable, \"the overwhelming thrust of authority upholds liability even under circumstances in which the use of the copyrighted work is of minimal consequence.\" 2 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> § 8.01[G], at 8-26.</p>\n<p>Here, the district court correctly recognized that the de minimis nature of the copying could lead to a finding of no substantial similarity. <i>See </i><i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 244. But its finding that the ASP's copying was not actionable because of its de minimis nature was based on its improper exclusion from consideration of large portions of SMS's works.</p>\n<p>The district court also correctly stated the test for substantial similarity, but then misapplied it. Substantial similarity \"focuses not on every aspect of the copyrighted work, but on those `aspects of the plaintiff's work [that] are protectible under copyright laws and whether whatever copying took place appropriated those [protected] elements.'\" <i>T-Peg,</i> 459 F.3d at 112 (alterations in original) (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 19). After identifying the aspects of the plaintiff's work that are protected by copyright, substantial similarity is assessed by comparing the protected elements of the plaintiff's work as a whole against the defendant's work. <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18. In performing the substantial similarity analysis, a court should be careful not to over-dissect the plaintiff's work, causing it to ignore the plaintiff's protectable expression. <i>See </i><i>CMM Cable Rep, Inc. v. Ocean Coast Props., Inc.,</i> 97 F.3d 1504, 1515 (1st Cir. 1996) (recognizing \"the potential `danger... that courts ... will so \"dissect\" the work as to classify all its elements as unprotectable ... [thereby possibly] blind[ing it] to the expressiveness of their ensemble'\" (alterations in original) (quoting J.C. Ginsburg, <i>Four Reasons and a</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> <i>Paradox: The Manifest Superiority of Copyright over Sui Generis Protection of Computer Software,</i> 94 Colum. L.Rev. 2259, 2561 (1994))).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court erred in determining which aspects of SMS's works were subject to copyright protection. This error prevented it from meaningfully analyzing the similarities between SMS's and ASP's works, caused prejudice, and requires reversal. We explain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Originality Requirement</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The originality requirement for copyright protection is not particularly rigorous. \"Original, as the term is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282. \"[T]he requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Originality under copyright  unlike the intellectual property protection provided under patent law, <i>see</i> 35 U.S.C. § 102  \"does not signify novelty,\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282. It merely means that the author did not himself copy his work from another source. Indeed, even a work that is identical to another is original for purposes of copyright protection so long as the author created it independently. <i>Id.</i> at 345-46, 111 S.Ct. 1282.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a work's entitlement to copyright protection does not depend in any way upon the court's subjective assessment of its creative worth. <i>See </i><i>Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.,</i> 188 U.S. 239, 251, 23 S.Ct. 298, 47 L.Ed. 460 (1903) (\"It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations ....\"); <i>see also </i><i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282 (recognizing that the \"vast majority of works\" possess the requisite \"creative spark\" for originality, \"`no matter how crude, humble, or obvious' it might be\" (quoting 1 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 1.08[C][1] (1990))).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court stated the correct standard for originality under copyright law, <i>see </i><i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 238, but misapplied it. The district court erroneously treated copyright law's originality requirement as functionally equivalent to a novelty standard. For example, the district court found SMS's works unoriginal because, in its view, they are \"filled with generalizations, platitudes, and observations of the obvious,\" <i>id.</i> at 239, contain \"not-so-stunning revelation[s],\" <i>id.</i> at 240, and teach, \"[a]t their creative zenith, ... common-sense communication skills,\" <i>id.</i> at 241.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the district court's originality analysis was obviously tainted by its own subjective assessment of the works' creative worth. Its assessment of originality displayed nothing but pejorative disdain for the value of SMS's works. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 239 (\"[The plaintiff's works] are dominated by unprotectable material. These works exemplify the sorts of training programs that serve as fodder for sardonic workplace humor that has given rise to the popular television show <i>The Office</i> and the movie <i>Office Space.</i> They are aggressively vapid  hundreds of pages filled with generalizations, platitudes, and observations of the obvious.\" (footnote omitted)). Yet neither the works' absolute novelty nor their creative value determines whether they are original for purposes of copyright protection.</p>\n<p>On the record evidence and applying the correct standard, SMS's works easily satisfy the originality requirement for copyright protection. ASP never argued that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> SMS had copied its works from another source, making them unoriginal to SMS. And SMS's works, which include text, flowcharts, and illustrations explaining techniques for communication and negotiation, certainly demonstrate the requisite \"minimal degree of creativity,\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282, for copyright protection. Thus, the district court erroneously excluded large portions of SMS's works from consideration under its substantial similarity analysis based upon its misapplication of the originality requirement. This mistake mattered to the outcome of the case. We hold that SMS has satisfied the originality requirement for the three works in question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Statutory Exclusion for Processes and Systems</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The copyright statute excludes from protection the processes and systems described in a work. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 102(b). When Congress revised the copyright code in 1976, it recognized that \"[§ ] 102(b) in no way enlarges or contracts the scope of copyright protection under the present law. Its purpose is to restate, in the context of the new single Federal system of copyright, that the basic dichotomy between expression and idea remains unchanged.\" H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5670 (1976).</p>\n<p>That idea/expression dichotomy is the \"most fundamental axiom of copyright law,\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 344, 111 S.Ct. 1282, and \"assures authors the right to their original expression, but encourages others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work,\" <i>id.</i> at 349-50, 111 S.Ct. 1282. That is, <i>descriptions</i> of a process or system are copyrightable, but the underlying process or system itself is not. <i>See </i><i>Matthews v. Freedman,</i> 157 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[C]opyright protects the original expressions of ideas but not the ideas expressed.\"). At least one circuit court has rejected as \"absurd\" the argument that management training materials contain no protectable expression because they teach a noncopyrightable process. <i>See </i><i>Kepner-Tregoe, Inc. v. Leadership Software, Inc.,</i> 12 F.3d 527, 534 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p>Thus, to the extent that SMS's works teach a process or system for effective communication and negotiation, others may freely describe that process or system by using their own original expression. But others may not appropriate SMS's expression when describing that process or system.</p>\n<p>Here, the district court improperly denied copyright protection to large portions of SMS's works because it, in an error of law, found \"they focus on concepts and teach a noncopyrightable process.\" <i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 240; <i>see also id.</i> at 241 (finding that \"the structure or essence of SMS's works is not copyrightable\" because, unlike a work of fiction that has a plot and characters, they merely discuss processes and ideas). The fact that SMS's works describe processes or systems does not make their <i>expression</i> noncopyrightable. <i>See </i><i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 350-51, 111 S.Ct. 1282 (holding that a factual compilation may be entitled to copyright protection if it features an original selection or arrangement of facts even though the underlying facts themselves are noncopyrightable). SMS's creative choices in describing those processes and systems, including the works' overall arrangement and structure, are subject to copyright protection. <i>See id.</i> (recognizing that the original selection and arrangement of noncopyrightable elements is entitled to copyright protection). The district court's analysis did what we cautioned against in <i>CMM Cable,</i> 97 F.3d at 1515: it lost sight of the expressiveness of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> works as a whole by focusing too closely on their noncopyrightable elements.</p>\n<p>Because the original selection and arrangement of noncopyrightable elements is itself copyrightable, the district court also erred in limiting the narrow copyright protection it allowed for SMS's works \"to little more than [their] original text and formatting.\" <i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 241. There are numerous ways to teach the concepts and processes disclosed in SMS's works and so SMS need not show \"`near identity' between the works at issue\" to prove copyright infringement. <i>Concrete Mach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc.,</i> 843 F.2d 600, 606 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting <i>Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Prods., Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.,</i> 562 F.2d 1157, 1167 (9th Cir.1977)). This is not a situation where the idea and expression have merged because \"there is essentially only one way to express an idea,\" making copying of the expression permissible. <i>Id.</i> Because of its legal error, the court's resulting factual conclusions regarding substantial similarity are clearly erroneous. These determinations are vacated and may be determined at a new trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The district court's analysis of substantial similarity improperly excluded from consideration large portions of SMS's works under the mistaken belief that they are unoriginal or a noncopyrightable process or system, making its assessment of substantial similarity clearly erroneous. We leave undisturbed the district court's finding of actual copying and hold, as a matter of law, that SMS's works both satisfy the originality requirement for copyright protection and are entitled to protection beyond the textual level even though they describe processes and systems. We leave the analysis of the question of substantial similarity between SMS's and ASP's works within the framework we have outlined to be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p>We <i>vacate</i> the district court's finding of noninfringement and <i>remand</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Because we vacate the district court's finding of noninfringement, we need not address the substance of the attorneys' fees issue raised by ASP's cross-appeal. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 505 (allowing the award of fees to the prevailing party in a copyright infringement suit). Each party will bear its own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The extent of copying is also relevant to the fair use defense, where one factor that determines the applicability of the defense is \"the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.\" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). ASP has not raised a fair use defense in this case.</p>\n<p>[2]  Further, commentators have viewed the de minimis copying doctrine as relating to instances of fragmented literal similarity, applicable only where \"no more than a line, or a paragraph, or a page or chapter of the copyrighted work has been appropriated.\" 4 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> § 13.03[A][2], at 13-53; <i>see also id.</i> § 13.03[A][1][e], at 13-52 to -53 (discussing substantial similarity under the heading \"Similarity of Limited Segments\"). On the facts of this case, however, where SMS has identified hundreds of instances of verbatim copying and rough paraphrasing in ASP's works and has also alleged infringement through the overall structure and arrangement of ASP's works, that aspect of the de minimis doctrine simply does not arise.</p>\n\n</div>",

It sued a competitor saying that the competitor had copied and used training materials substantially similar to plaintiff's in violation of the copyright laws.</p>\n<p>This case concerns the proper application of two definitional criteria for what subject matter is eligible for copyright protection. The first is the originality requirement, <i>see</i> 17 U.S.C. § 102(a) (\"Copyright protection subsists ... in original works of authorship ....\"), which is a constitutional prerequisite for copyright protection. <i>See </i><i>Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>, 351, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span> (1991). The second is the statutory codification of the exclusion from copyright protection for processes and systems. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) (\"In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\"). Indeed, the statutory restriction in § 102(b) is a codification of \"[t]he most fundamental axiom of copyright law ... that `[n]o author may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates.'\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 344-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span> (1985)).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court considered the plaintiff's works \"largely noncopyrightable because they are devoted to describing a process or because they are not original.\" <i>Situation Mgmt. Sys. v. ASP Consulting Group,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1737362\"><a href=\"/opinion/1737362/situation-mgt-systems-v-asp-consulting-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

To reach this conclusion, the district court treated the originality requirement as functionally equivalent to a novelty standard. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 243 (finding that the plaintiff's work \"does not constitute original expression because it is merely a summary of common-sense communication skills\"). It read the statutory exclusion of processes and systems from copyright protection as barring protection for <i>descriptions</i> of processes and systems. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 240 (finding the plaintiff's works largely unprotected by copyright because \"they focus on concepts and teach a noncopyrightable process\"). The court also found the plaintiff's works noncopyrightable based upon its own subjective assessment of the works' creative worth. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 239 (describing SMS's works as \"fodder for sardonic workplace humor\" and as \"aggressively vapid\").</p>\n<p>A brief from amici, an industry association along with another company that produces corporate training materials, argues that the district court's conclusions have implications far beyond the dispute between the parties to this case and put at risk the legitimate copyright expectations of the more than $100 billion management training industry. Indeed, amici argue that under the district court's approach, those in the training industry would have difficulty obtaining effective copyright protection for their works. We vacate the district court's finding of noninfringement and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>For more than thirty years, plaintiff Situation Management Systems, Inc. (\"SMS\") has provided consulting services aimed at improving employee communication and negotiation skills within the workplace. As part of its services, SMS has developed a series of training materials focused on teaching effective communication and negotiation techniques. Companies buy these materials from SMS and use them in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> employee training workshops. SMS typically charges its clients $200 to $250 per participant for the use of its materials. SMS's clients include Anheuser-Busch, General Mills, NASA, Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble, Verizon, and companies abroad.</p>\n<p>A number of SMS employees, including Dane Harwood and Alexander Moore, left SMS after Sharon Malouf acquired the company through bankruptcy proceedings in 2001. Following the end of Harwood's noncompete period, Harwood and Moore, along with an executive from a former European sublicensee of SMS, Alon Shklarek, founded defendant ASP. Consulting LLC (\"ASP\") in 2003. ASP offers training programs similar to SMS's, and the two compete for the same customers. ASP also has a series of training materials that focus on the same subject matter and teach similar communication and negotiation strategies as SMS's.</p>\n<p>SMS claims ASP infringed its copyright in three of SMS's training workbooks: <i>Positive Power &amp; Influence</i> (<i>\"PPI\"</i>), <i>Positive Negotiation Program</i> (<i>\"PNP\"</i>), and <i>Promoting and Implementing Innovation</i> (<i>\"PII\"</i>). <i>PPI</i> was first published in 1976 and is currently in its fourth edition. <i>PPI</i> is SMS's most widely circulated work and generates approximately seventy-five percent of SMS's revenues. More than a quarter million people have taken the <i>PPI</i> course. <i>PNP,</i> now in its third edition, was first published in 1978 and accounts for approximately fifteen percent of SMS's revenues. <i>PII</i> was first published in 1993 and is a much smaller part of SMS's business than the other two works at issue. SMS's works contain hundreds of pages of text, flowcharts, and illustrations teaching techniques for communication and negotiation within the workplace.</p>\n<p>This suit claims infringement by three of defendant ASP's workbooks: <i>Communicating 2 Influence</i> (<i>\"C2I\"</i>), <i>Negotiating Successful Agreements</i> (<i>\"NSA\"</i>), and <i>Championing Ideas</i> (<i>\"CI\"</i>). SMS claims that ASP's <i>C2I</i> infringes its copyright to <i>PPI,</i> that <i>NSA</i> infringes <i>PNP,</i> and that <i>CI</i> infringes <i>PII.</i> ASP's works address the same topics as SMS's. Considering the circumstances under which ASP developed its materials, the district court found that this similarity was no coincidence. <i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 235. In particular, Harwood, Moore, and Shklarek each had access to SMS's works prior to forming ASP; Harwood even kept copies of SMS's works in the attic of his home after he left SMS. And Harwood and Moore were intimately familiar with SMS's works, having authored several editions of <i>PPI, PNP,</i> and <i>PII</i> while working at SMS. Moreover, Harwood and Moore together authored each of the allegedly infringing works relatively quickly after forming ASP. For example, they prepared a version of <i>C2I</i> over a period of six to thirty-four days.</p>\n<p>On September 24, 2003, one of SMS's European licensees contacted Malouf to tell her that ASP's new <i>C2I</i> program was the same as SMS's <i>PPI.</i> Malouf then visited ASP's website and read a brief description of <i>C2I,</i> which she found strikingly similar to the <i>PPI</i> program. Malouf contacted ASP and asked to see ASP's written materials so that she could assess whether SMS had a claim against ASP for copyright infringement. SMS and ASP were unable to reach an agreement regarding the conditions under which Malouf could inspect ASP's works, and Malouf did not view ASP's works before filing suit.</p>\n<p>On December 28, 2005, based upon the tip from the European licensee and the information on ASP's website, Malouf believed that SMS had a viable claim of copyright infringement and sued ASP in federal district court in New Hampshire, where SMS has its principal place of business. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> That suit was ultimately dismissed on August 15, 2006 for lack of personal jurisdiction over ASP.</p>\n<p>SMS then sued ASP in the District of Massachusetts on September 1, 2006. The district court denied the parties cross-motions for summary judgment, and the parties agreed to treat the matter as a case stated. The district court held a hearing on ASP's liability for copyright infringement on November 7, 2007. At the hearing, SMS stated that it would seek statutory damages, not its actual damages. SMS had sued ASP before it had incurred any substantial actual damages as a result of ASP's alleged infringement. In its post-hearing briefing, SMS explained that it was seeking statutory damages of $75,000 for each infringing work, instead of actual damages, because ASP's \"sales were apparently limited (to just a few customers) but [its] conduct was deliberate.\"</p>\n<p>The district court found that ASP had copied SMS's works. It recognized that \"[i]t is undisputed that Harwood and Moore had intimate familiarity with SMS's programs because they helped write them\" and that \"Harwood, Moore, and at least one other ASP employee had access to SMS's works during the period when they generated the accused works.\" <i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 235. This level of access to and familiarity with SMS's works, coupled with \"[t]he fact that ASP's works address the same topics as SMS's\" and the speed with which ASP produced its own works, indicated \"that the creators of ASP's programs used SMS's materials in creating their own.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The district court, however, determined that ASP's copying was not actionable because ASP's works were not substantially similar to the copyright protected aspects of SMS's works. It found that \"the works at issue are so dominated by nonprotectable material that it is impossible to reduce the work to a copyrightable essence or structure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 240. Accordingly, it held that the copyright protection for SMS's works \"is limited to little more than [their] original text and formatting.\" <i>Id.</i> at 241.</p>\n<p>Having narrowly defined the scope of SMS's copyright protection and excluded from consideration a great deal of SMS's materials, the district court then evaluated the similarities between the limited universe of SMS's and ASP's works it thought was subject to copyright protection. The district court recognized a \"few minor incidents of verbatim repetition\" between <i>C2I</i> and <i>PPI. Id.</i> at 244. But after excising from consideration \"much of the substance\" of <i>PPI</i> as \"simply not copyrightable,\" <i>id.</i> at 242, it found that <i>C2I</i> and <i>PPI</i> \"as a whole are not substantially similar,\" <i>id.</i> at 244. Likewise, it held that <i>CI</i> \"successfully avoided infringement\" of <i>PII</i> because \"[t]here is no verbatim replication of words or phrases, and the graphical depictions are quite distinct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 246. Finally, it found \"no structural similarity\" between <i>NSA</i> and <i>PNP,</i> dismissing instances of verbatim copying as \"few and far between\" and \"of minimal importance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 248. Finding no substantial similarity between the aspects of SMS's and ASP's works that it considered protectable, the district court entered a judgment of noninfringement. <i>Id.</i> at 249.</p>\n<p>SMS timely appealed. The Association of Learning Providers, an industry association serving training companies, and Blanchard Training and Development, Inc., who like SMS and ASP sells corporate training materials, filed a brief as amici curiae in support of reversal.</p>\n<p>The district court denied ASP's request for attorneys' fees as the prevailing party in a copyright suit under 17 U.S.C. § 505. ASP cross-appeals that decision, arguing that SMS brought this \"expensive, unmeritorious <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> litigation\" to drive ASP out of business. The cost of defending this suit, ASP represents, has rendered it insolvent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>\"In a case stated, the parties waive trial and present the case to the court on the undisputed facts in the pretrial record.

Of course, a district court's use of incorrect relevant legal standards will lead to reversal unless that use had no prejudicial effects.</p>\n<p>To establish copyright infringement, the plaintiff must prove two elements: \"(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 361, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

ASP does not dispute that SMS owns a valid copyright interest in its works, and SMS's certificates of copyright are prima facie evidence of its ownership of valid copyright interests in its works, <i>see </i><i>Johnson v. Gordon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201613\"><a href=\"/opinion/201613/johnson-v-gordon/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Our analysis, therefore, focuses entirely on whether the district court properly applied the second element of the <i>Feist</i> test. That prong \"itself involves two steps: the plaintiff must show (a) that the defendant actually copied the work as a factual matter, ... and (b) that the defendant's `copying of the copyrighted material was so extensive that it rendered the infringing and copyrighted works \"substantially similar.'\"'\" <i>T-Peg, Inc. v. Vt. Timber Works, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202362\"><a href=\"/opinion/202362/t-peg-inc-v-vermont-timber/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 108 (1st Cir.2006) (citations omitted) (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18). On appeal, ASP wisely does not contest the district court's finding of actual copying, so our analysis centers on the district court's application of the test for substantial similarity.</p>\n<p>The burden is on the plaintiff to prove substantial similarity between the plaintiff's and defendant's works. <i>T-Peg,</i> 459 F.3d at 108. Substantial similarity exists \"if a reasonable, ordinary observer, upon examination of the two works, would `conclude that the defendant unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff's protectable expression.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 112 (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18).</p>\n<p>At oral argument, counsel for ASP argued that the district court's conclusion should best be understood as being that the amount of copying done was so small as to be de minimis. <i>See </i><i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 244 (\"Such de minimis duplication does not amount to infringement.\"). Even if that were accurate, it not sufficient to salvage the district court's finding of noninfringement, however, for it ignores the fact that the court first excluded from consideration of the works copied the bulk of SMS's materials on the grounds that it was not subject to protection at all. If the court erred in that exclusion, then it used the wrong measure for substantial similarity.</p>\n<p>Further, the de minimis copying doctrine in copyright does not operate as broadly as ASP suggests. The extent of copying from the plaintiff's work is, of course, relevant to the analysis of substantial similarity. If such a small amount of the plaintiff's work is copied that the two works cannot be said to be substantially <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> similar, then no infringement results.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See</i> 2 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright,</i> § 8.01[G], at 8-26 (2008) (\"[F]or similarity to be substantial, and hence actionable, it must apply to more than simply a <i>de minimis</i> fragment.\"). \"Used in this fashion, `<i>de minimis</i> copying' represents simply the converse of substantial similarity.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This statement should not be misunderstood. That the copying involved only a small portion of the plaintiff's work does not by itself make the copying permissible. Indeed, \"even if the similar material is quantitatively small, if it is qualitatively important, the trier of fact may properly find substantial similarity.\" 4 <i>id.</i> § 13.03[A][2][a], at 13-55. As a result, de minimis copying is best viewed not as a separate defense to copyright infringement but rather as a statement regarding the strength of the plaintiff's proof of substantial similarity.<sup>[2]</sup> Where substantial similarity exists and the fair use doctrine, as here, is inapplicable, \"the overwhelming thrust of authority upholds liability even under circumstances in which the use of the copyrighted work is of minimal consequence.\" 2 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> § 8.01[G], at 8-26.</p>\n<p>Here, the district court correctly recognized that the de minimis nature of the copying could lead to a finding of no substantial similarity. <i>See </i><i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 244. But its finding that the ASP's copying was not actionable because of its de minimis nature was based on its improper exclusion from consideration of large portions of SMS's works.</p>\n<p>The district court also correctly stated the test for substantial similarity, but then misapplied it. Substantial similarity \"focuses not on every aspect of the copyrighted work, but on those `aspects of the plaintiff's work [that] are protectible under copyright laws and whether whatever copying took place appropriated those [protected] elements.'\" <i>T-Peg,</i> 459 F.3d at 112 (alterations in original) (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 19). After identifying the aspects of the plaintiff's work that are protected by copyright, substantial similarity is assessed by comparing the protected elements of the plaintiff's work as a whole against the defendant's work. <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18. In performing the substantial similarity analysis, a court should be careful not to over-dissect the plaintiff's work, causing it to ignore the plaintiff's protectable expression. <i>See </i><i>CMM Cable Rep, Inc. v. Ocean Coast Props., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727991\"><a href=\"/opinion/727991/cmm-cable-rep-inc-dba-creative-media-management-inc-v-ocean-coast/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1504</span></a></span>, 1515 (1st Cir. 1996) (recognizing \"the potential `danger... that courts ... will so \"dissect\" the work as to classify all its elements as unprotectable ... [thereby possibly] blind[ing it] to the expressiveness of their ensemble'\" (alterations in original) (quoting J.C. Ginsburg, <i>Four Reasons and a</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> <i>Paradox: The Manifest Superiority of Copyright over Sui Generis Protection of Computer Software,</i> 94 Colum. L.Rev. 2259, 2561 (1994))).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court erred in determining which aspects of SMS's works were subject to copyright protection. This error prevented it from meaningfully analyzing the similarities between SMS's and ASP's works, caused prejudice, and requires reversal. We explain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Originality Requirement</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The originality requirement for copyright protection is not particularly rigorous. \"Original, as the term is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 345, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span>. \"[T]he requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Originality under copyright  unlike the intellectual property protection provided under patent law, <i>see</i> 35 U.S.C. § 102  \"does not signify novelty,\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 345, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span>. It merely means that the author did not himself copy his work from another source. Indeed, even a work that is identical to another is original for purposes of copyright protection so long as the author created it independently. <i>Id.</i> at 345-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a work's entitlement to copyright protection does not depend in any way upon the court's subjective assessment of its creative worth. <i>See </i><i>Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95780\"><a href=\"/opinion/95780/bleistein-v-donaldson-lithographing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, 251, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></span> (1903) (\"It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations ....\"); <i>see also </i><i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 345, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span> (recognizing that the \"vast majority of works\" possess the requisite \"creative spark\" for originality, \"`no matter how crude, humble, or obvious' it might be\" (quoting 1 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 1.08[C][1] (1990))).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court stated the correct standard for originality under copyright law, <i>see </i><i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 238, but misapplied it. The district court erroneously treated copyright law's originality requirement as functionally equivalent to a novelty standard. For example, the district court found SMS's works unoriginal because, in its view, they are \"filled with generalizations, platitudes, and observations of the obvious,\" <i>id.</i> at 239, contain \"not-so-stunning revelation[s],\" <i>id.</i> at 240, and teach, \"[a]t their creative zenith, ... common-sense communication skills,\" <i>id.</i> at 241.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the district court's originality analysis was obviously tainted by its own subjective assessment of the works' creative worth. Its assessment of originality displayed nothing but pejorative disdain for the value of SMS's works. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 239 (\"[The plaintiff's works] are dominated by unprotectable material. These works exemplify the sorts of training programs that serve as fodder for sardonic workplace humor that has given rise to the popular television show <i>The Office</i> and the movie <i>Office Space.</i> They are aggressively vapid  hundreds of pages filled with generalizations, platitudes, and observations of the obvious.\" (footnote omitted)). Yet neither the works' absolute novelty nor their creative value determines whether they are original for purposes of copyright protection.</p>\n<p>On the record evidence and applying the correct standard, SMS's works easily satisfy the originality requirement for copyright protection. ASP never argued that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> SMS had copied its works from another source, making them unoriginal to SMS. And SMS's works, which include text, flowcharts, and illustrations explaining techniques for communication and negotiation, certainly demonstrate the requisite \"minimal degree of creativity,\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 345, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span>, for copyright protection. Thus, the district court erroneously excluded large portions of SMS's works from consideration under its substantial similarity analysis based upon its misapplication of the originality requirement. This mistake mattered to the outcome of the case. We hold that SMS has satisfied the originality requirement for the three works in question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Statutory Exclusion for Processes and Systems</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The copyright statute excludes from protection the processes and systems described in a work. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 102(b). When Congress revised the copyright code in 1976, it recognized that \"[§ ] 102(b) in no way enlarges or contracts the scope of copyright protection under the present law. Its purpose is to restate, in the context of the new single Federal system of copyright, that the basic dichotomy between expression and idea remains unchanged.\" H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5670 (1976).</p>\n<p>That idea/expression dichotomy is the \"most fundamental axiom of copyright law,\" <i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 344, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span>, and \"assures authors the right to their original expression, but encourages others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work,\" <i>id.</i> at 349-50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span>. That is, <i>descriptions</i> of a process or system are copyrightable, but the underlying process or system itself is not. <i>See </i><i>Matthews v. Freedman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198159\"><a href=\"/opinion/198159/matthews-v-freedman/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[C]opyright protects the original expressions of ideas but not the ideas expressed.\"). At least one circuit court has rejected as \"absurd\" the argument that management training materials contain no protectable expression because they teach a noncopyrightable process. <i>See </i><i>Kepner-Tregoe, Inc. v. Leadership Software, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659340\"><a href=\"/opinion/659340/kepner-tregoe-inc-v-leadership-software-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 534 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p>Thus, to the extent that SMS's works teach a process or system for effective communication and negotiation, others may freely describe that process or system by using their own original expression. But others may not appropriate SMS's expression when describing that process or system.</p>\n<p>Here, the district court improperly denied copyright protection to large portions of SMS's works because it, in an error of law, found \"they focus on concepts and teach a noncopyrightable process.\" <i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 240; <i>see also id.</i> at 241 (finding that \"the structure or essence of SMS's works is not copyrightable\" because, unlike a work of fiction that has a plot and characters, they merely discuss processes and ideas). The fact that SMS's works describe processes or systems does not make their <i>expression</i> noncopyrightable. <i>See </i><i>Feist,</i> 499 U.S. at 350-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span> (holding that a factual compilation may be entitled to copyright protection if it features an original selection or arrangement of facts even though the underlying facts themselves are noncopyrightable). SMS's creative choices in describing those processes and systems, including the works' overall arrangement and structure, are subject to copyright protection. <i>See id.</i> (recognizing that the original selection and arrangement of noncopyrightable elements is entitled to copyright protection). The district court's analysis did what we cautioned against in <i>CMM Cable,</i> 97 F.3d at 1515: it lost sight of the expressiveness of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> works as a whole by focusing too closely on their noncopyrightable elements.</p>\n<p>Because the original selection and arrangement of noncopyrightable elements is itself copyrightable, the district court also erred in limiting the narrow copyright protection it allowed for SMS's works \"to little more than [their] original text and formatting.\" <i>Situation Mgmt.,</i> 535 F.Supp.2d at 241. There are numerous ways to teach the concepts and processes disclosed in SMS's works and so SMS need not show \"`near identity' between the works at issue\" to prove copyright infringement. <i>Concrete Mach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503998\"><a href=\"/opinion/503998/concrete-machinery-company-inc-v-classic-lawn-ornaments-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting <i>Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Prods., Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349388\"><a href=\"/opinion/349388/sid-marty-krofft-television-productions-inc-and-sid-marty-krofft/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span>, 1167 (9th Cir.1977)). This is not a situation where the idea and expression have merged because \"there is essentially only one way to express an idea,\" making copying of the expression permissible. <i>Id.</i> Because of its legal error, the court's resulting factual conclusions regarding substantial similarity are clearly erroneous. These determinations are vacated and may be determined at a new trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The district court's analysis of substantial similarity improperly excluded from consideration large portions of SMS's works under the mistaken belief that they are unoriginal or a noncopyrightable process or system, making its assessment of substantial similarity clearly erroneous. We leave undisturbed the district court's finding of actual copying and hold, as a matter of law, that SMS's works both satisfy the originality requirement for copyright protection and are entitled to protection beyond the textual level even though they describe processes and systems. We leave the analysis of the question of substantial similarity between SMS's and ASP's works within the framework we have outlined to be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p>We <i>vacate</i> the district court's finding of noninfringement and <i>remand</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Because we vacate the district court's finding of noninfringement, we need not address the substance of the attorneys' fees issue raised by ASP's cross-appeal. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 505 (allowing the award of fees to the prevailing party in a copyright infringement suit). Each party will bear its own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The extent of copying is also relevant to the fair use defense, where one factor that determines the applicability of the defense is \"the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.\" 17 U.S.C. § 107(3). ASP has not raised a fair use defense in this case.</p>\n<p>[2]  Further, commentators have viewed the de minimis copying doctrine as relating to instances of fragmented literal similarity, applicable only where \"no more than a line, or a paragraph, or a page or chapter of the copyrighted work has been appropriated.\" 4 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> § 13.03[A][2], at 13-53; <i>see also id.</i> § 13.03[A][1][e], at 13-52 to -53 (discussing substantial similarity under the heading \"Similarity of Limited Segments\"). On the facts of this case, however, where SMS has identified hundreds of instances of verbatim copying and rough paraphrasing in ASP's works and has also alleged infringement through the overall structure and arrangement of ASP's works, that aspect of the de minimis doctrine simply does not arise.</p>\n\n</div>",
