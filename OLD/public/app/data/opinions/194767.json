In 1988  Ciba  Corning  Diagnostics\n                     \n\nCorporation  (\"Ciba\")  placed  an  advertisement  seeking   a\n\n\"manufacturing engineer-mechanical.\"   Priya K. Das  applied,\n\nbut was not hired, or, for that matter, granted an interview.\n\nHe  sued Ciba alleging,  under various legal  theories,1 that\n\nhe  was denied  employment because  of his  age  and national\n\norigin.   After  some discovery,  a hearing  was held  on the\n\nparties'  cross motions for  summary judgment.   The district\n\ncourt  granted  summary  judgment in  Ciba's  favor  and also\n\nallowed its  motion  for sanctions,  fining  Das $250.    Das\n\nappeals both rulings.  Finding no error, we affirm. \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          The facts are essentially undisputed and we recount\n\nthem in a light favorable to the plaintiff.\n\n          The advertisement that gave rise to this litigation\n\ndescribed  Ciba as a  company engaged in  medical diagnostics\n\nand biomedical research.  The  ad stated: \"We are looking for\n\nan individual  to provide mechanical  engineering support  to\n\nthe medical  instrument assembly  and test areas.  . .  . The\n\nideal  candidate will have  a B.S. in  Mechanical Engineering\n\n                    \n\n1.   Das' suit alleged violations  of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.   \n2000e  et  seq.;  the Age  Discrimination  in  Employment Act\n               \n(\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C.    621 et seq.; and the  Civil Rights Act\n                                  \nof 1866,  42 U.S.C.    1981.   \"[T]he standards  of liability\nunder all [of  these statutes] are substantially  identical,\"\nVillanueva  v. Wellesley College, 930  F.2d 124, 126 n.2 (1st\n                                \nCir.), cert. denied, 112 S.  Ct. 181 (1991), and the district\n                   \ncourt, accordingly, analyzed Das' claims collectively.   \n\n                             -2-\n\nand  3-5 years of experience in a manufacturing environment.\"\n\nOf 57  applicants, Das  and 53  others were  not interviewed.\n\nBorn and educated  in India, Das was  46 years of age  at the\n\ntime.   Ciba hired  a younger  candidate who  possessed, like\n\nDas, a  B.S. in mechanical  engineering, but  had only  three\n\nyears  of  work  experience.   Dissatisfied  with  the hiring\n\ndecision, Das wrote to Ciba  for an explanation.  The company\n\nresponded that Das'  25 years of experience were  not a \"good\n\nfit\"  with  the criteria  set  for the  entry  level position\n\nadvertised.  This suit ensued.\n\n          In an  affidavit supporting its  motion for summary\n\njudgment  Ciba averred  that Das' application  was eliminated\n\nbecause (1) the company was  not interested in candidates who\n\nchanged jobs every  two years: \"Das' excessive  `job hopping'\n\nmade him a very unattractive candidate,\" and (2) none of Das'\n\nexperience  related to the  medical or biomedical  field.  It\n\nwas  attested that the  hired candidate's hands-on experience\n\nin plastics was the deciding factor in making a job offer due\n\nto the  increased use of plastic  parts in the industry.   As\n\nsuch,  the hiree possessed  more relevant experience  for the\n\nadvertised position under the hiring criteria then in place.\n\n          In   opposition,  Das   pointed  to   his  superior\n\neducation   and   experience  which,   he   declared   in  an\n\naccompanying affidavit, fully qualified him for the job.  The\n\ndenial  of employment because  of his 25  years of experience\n\n                             -3-\n\nshows,  he  asserted,  that   Ciba's  selection  process  was\n\ngrounded  in age bias.  And, Das  claimed, the fact that Ciba\n\nlater  changed its story  and offered a  different rationale,\n\ni.e., that he  was a job-hopper, signified a  cover-up of the\n\ntrue reason for  the hiring decision.  According  to Das, his\n\njob changes were  either for career advancement or the result\n\nof   layoffs,  plant  closings,  and  the  like,  all  common\n\noccurrences in  manufacturing industries.   Accordingly,  the\n\njob-hopper label was  untrue, and  merely a  pretext for  the\n\nreal reason: age discrimination.\n\n          Following a hearing, the district court ruled  from\n\nthe  bench that  Das, in  attacking  the person  hired as  an\n\nunqualified  candidate,  had  failed  to  offer  sufficiently\n\nprobative evidence from which  a fact-finder could reasonably\n\ninfer that defendant's  hiring reasons were a pretext for age\n\nor  national  origin  discrimination.    Accordingly,  Ciba's\n\nmotion  for summary  judgment was  allowed,  and Das'  cross-\n\nmotion for summary judgment was denied.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n          This suit  is virtually  identical to  three others\n\nbrought  by Das  after he  was  not hired  for an  advertised\n\nengineer  position  solely  because of  the  contents  of his\n\nresume.   See Das  v. Cri-Tech, Inc.,  No. 90-1769,  slip op.\n                                    \n\n(1st Cir. Jun. 12, 1991)  (Das I);  Das v. Bowmar/Ali,  Inc.,\n                                                            \n\n                             -4-\n\nNo. 90-2096, slip op. (1st Cir. Jun. 21, 1991) (Das II),  and\n                                                       \n\nDas v. A.W.  Chesterton Co., No. 91-1159, slip  op. (1st Cir.\n                           \n\nSept. 24, 1991) (Das  III).  Each prior appeal -  - also from\n                         \n\nan adverse  summary judgment  - - was  affirmed on  the basis\n\nthat  Das  had  failed  to  present  any  probative  evidence\n\npermitting an  inference that  the hiring  decision masked  a\n\ndiscriminatory motive or  was otherwise incredible.   In this\n\nappeal,   we   focus,   as  does   appellant,   on   the  age\n\ndiscrimination claim.\n\n          In Das  I and  Das II, we  described the  standards\n                               \n\napplicable  to summary  judgment  in the  disparate treatment\n\nemployment discrimination context,  and do not  restate them.\n\nSee  also Goldman  v. First  Nat'l Bank  of Boston,  985 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1113, 1116-18 &amp; n.4 (1st  Cir. 1993).  The Supreme Court  has\n\nrecently  clarified the  standards  for  liability under  the\n\nADEA.   Hazen Paper Co. v.  Biggins, 113 S. Ct.  1701 (1993).\n                                   \n\nThe Court  explained that  \"there is  no disparate  treatment\n\nunder the ADEA  when the  factor motivating  the employer  is\n\nsome feature other than the  employee's age,\" id. at 1705; \"a\n                                                 \n\ndisparate   treatment  claim   cannot   succeed  unless   the\n\nemployee's protected  trait actually  played a  role in  [the\n\nemployer's  decisionmaking] process  and had  a determinative\n\ninfluence on the outcome.\"  Id. at 1706.\n                               \n\n          We  assume, as  did the  district  court, that  Das\n\nsatisfied the  prima facie rubric  for hiring  discrimination\n\n                             -5-\n\nclaims.  Keyes v. Secretary of the Navy, 853 F.2d 1016,  1023\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1988).   Ciba clearly and  sufficiently articulated\n\npermissible   non-discriminatory  reasons   for  its   hiring\n\ndecision, requiring Das to show that explanation \"unworthy of\n\ncredence,\"  that is, \"not the true  reason for the employment\n\ndecision.\"  Texas  Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 248, 256 (1981).\n\n          We conclude, relying on the analysis set out in Das\n                                                             \n\nII, that  plaintiff failed  to undercut  the plausibility  of\n  \n\nCiba's  proffered  rationale  with  specific  facts (and  not\n\nmerely  subjective conclusions) that  would enable a  jury to\n\nfind that age  was an undisclosed,  motivating factor in  the\n\nhiring decision.   In so  deciding, we note, first,  that Das\n\nhas  not attempted  to counter  Ciba's  explanation that  his\n\nresume  indicated  no  experience  in the  medical/biomedical\n\nfields.  Second, regarding Das' claim that  Ciba \"changed its\n\nstory\" and  later offered a  different reason for  not hiring\n\nhim, Das  has failed  to show that  those later  reasons were\n\npremised  upon  discriminatory  motive.   As  we  have stated\n\nbefore:  \"Since an  employer's nondiscriminatory  motivations\n\nfor adverse  employment decisions  are irrelevant  in an  age\n\ndiscrimination  case, a  `mere  showing  that the  employer's\n\narticulated    reason    may   shield    another    (possibly\n\nnondiscriminatory)  reason  does  not  create  a  dispute  of\n\nmaterial  fact' sufficient  to  withstand summary  judgment.\"\n\n                             -6-\n\nGoldman,   985  F.2d  at  1118  n.4  (quoting  Villanueva  v.\n                                                         \n\nWellesley  College, 930  F.2d  124,  128  (1st  Cir.),  cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 112 S. Ct. 181 (1991)).\n      \n\n          Finally,  Das stresses the role that his many years\n\nin the  field may have played  in hurting his chances  to get\n\nthe job.   He argues that hiring criteria which impermissibly\n\nfavor a minimum number of years of work experience make age a\n\ndetermining  factor in the selection process and, because age\n\nand experience  are directly  related, effectively  eliminate\n\nall applicants over 40 years of age.  The Biggins decision is\n                                                 \n\ninstructive  on this  point.   In deciding  that a  dismissal\n\nbased   solely  on  pension  status  was  not  discriminatory\n\ntreatment on  the basis of  age for ADEA purposes,  the Court\n\nemphasized  that  \"[b]ecause  age and  years  of  service are\n\nanalytically  distinct, an employer  can take account  of one\n\nwhile ignoring  the other,  and thus it  is incorrect  to say\n\nthat a  decision based  on years  of  service is  necessarily\n\n`age-based'.\"  Biggins,  113 S. Ct.  at 1707.   Consequently,\n                      \n\nthe ADEA  is  not violated  when  the factor  motivating  the\n\nemployment decision merely correlates  with age, i.e.,  gives\n\nrise to a  permissive and not a necessary inference.  By like\n\ntoken, having failed to show  that age actually played a role\n\nin the decision not to hire him, Das may not, under  Biggins,\n                                                            \n\nask  us to  presume that  the employer's  decision to  hire a\n\ncandidate   with  significantly   less  work   experience  is\n\n                             -7-\n\nautomatically age-based.  As Biggins makes plain, even if, as\n                                    \n\nDas speculates, older  workers are likely to  have more years\n\nof work experience, Ciba's decision to hire an engineer  with\n\nthree  years of  desired experience  does  not, without  more\n\nevidence  than is offered here, implicate the prohibitions of\n\nthe ADEA.2\n\n                              II\n                                \n\n          We turn to  the issue of sanctions.  In  Das II, we\n                                                         \n\nupheld a $1420 award of attorneys' fees and costs against Das\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 11.  Here, Ciba contended that  Das had\n\nviolated  Rule 11  by  irresponsibly maintaining  this action\n\nafter  three  similar  (and  similarly meritless)  complaints\n\nagainst  other corporate defendants had been dismissed.  Ciba\n\nsought attorneys' fees  and costs in excess of  $12,000.  The\n\ndistrict court found that Das' claims, filed in October 1989,\n\nwere  brought in good  faith and were  objectively reasonable\n\nuntil the filing of his cross motion for summary judgment one\n\nyear  later.    By that  time,  Das  I and  Das  II  had been\n                                                   \n\ndismissed in the  district court, and Das had  reason to know\n\nthat his  cross motion was  neither well founded in  fact nor\n\nwarranted in existing  law.  Taking into account  Das' pro se\n                                                             \n\nstatus,   the  court  concluded  that  a  $250  sanction  was\n\n                    \n\n2.  Nor  do we  read Das'  complaint  to state  a claim  that\nCiba's  facially  neutral hiring  practices impact  older job\napplicants  more harshly.   The  Court has  not  recognized a\n\"disparate  impact\"  theory  of  liability  under  the  ADEA.\nBiggins, 113 S. Ct. at 1706.\n       \n\n                             -8-\n\nappropriate.    We  find  no  abuse  of  discretion  in  this\n\ncarefully  considered determination.    Anderson v.

Ct. 181 (1991), and the district\n                   \ncourt, accordingly, analyzed Das' claims collectively.   \n\n                             -2-\n\nand  3-5 years of experience in a manufacturing environment.\"\n\nOf 57  applicants, Das  and 53  others were  not interviewed.\n\nBorn and educated  in India, Das was  46 years of age  at the\n\ntime.   Ciba hired  a younger  candidate who  possessed, like\n\nDas, a  B.S. in mechanical  engineering, but  had only  three\n\nyears  of  work  experience.   Dissatisfied  with  the hiring\n\ndecision, Das wrote to Ciba  for an explanation.  The company\n\nresponded that Das'  25 years of experience were  not a \"good\n\nfit\"  with  the criteria  set  for the  entry  level position\n\nadvertised.  This suit ensued.\n\n          In an  affidavit supporting its  motion for summary\n\njudgment  Ciba averred  that Das' application  was eliminated\n\nbecause (1) the company was  not interested in candidates who\n\nchanged jobs every  two years: \"Das' excessive  `job hopping'\n\nmade him a very unattractive candidate,\" and (2) none of Das'\n\nexperience  related to the  medical or biomedical  field.  It\n\nwas  attested that the  hired candidate's hands-on experience\n\nin plastics was the deciding factor in making a job offer due\n\nto the  increased use of plastic  parts in the industry.   As\n\nsuch,  the hiree possessed  more relevant experience  for the\n\nadvertised position under the hiring criteria then in place.\n\n          In   opposition,  Das   pointed  to   his  superior\n\neducation   and   experience  which,   he   declared   in  an\n\naccompanying affidavit, fully qualified him for the job.  The\n\ndenial  of employment because  of his 25  years of experience\n\n                             -3-\n\nshows,  he  asserted,  that   Ciba's  selection  process  was\n\ngrounded  in age bias.  And, Das  claimed, the fact that Ciba\n\nlater  changed its story  and offered a  different rationale,\n\ni.e., that he  was a job-hopper, signified a  cover-up of the\n\ntrue reason for  the hiring decision.  According  to Das, his\n\njob changes were  either for career advancement or the result\n\nof   layoffs,  plant  closings,  and  the  like,  all  common\n\noccurrences in  manufacturing industries.   Accordingly,  the\n\njob-hopper label was  untrue, and  merely a  pretext for  the\n\nreal reason: age discrimination.\n\n          Following a hearing, the district court ruled  from\n\nthe  bench that  Das, in  attacking  the person  hired as  an\n\nunqualified  candidate,  had  failed  to  offer  sufficiently\n\nprobative evidence from which  a fact-finder could reasonably\n\ninfer that defendant's  hiring reasons were a pretext for age\n\nor  national  origin  discrimination.    Accordingly,  Ciba's\n\nmotion  for summary  judgment was  allowed,  and Das'  cross-\n\nmotion for summary judgment was denied.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n          This suit  is virtually  identical to  three others\n\nbrought  by Das  after he  was  not hired  for an  advertised\n\nengineer  position  solely  because of  the  contents  of his\n\nresume.   See Das  v. Cri-Tech, Inc.,  No. 90-1769,  slip op.\n                                    \n\n(1st Cir. Jun. 12, 1991)  (Das I);  Das v.

In so  deciding, we note, first,  that Das\n\nhas  not attempted  to counter  Ciba's  explanation that  his\n\nresume  indicated  no  experience  in the  medical/biomedical\n\nfields.  Second, regarding Das' claim that  Ciba \"changed its\n\nstory\" and  later offered a  different reason for  not hiring\n\nhim, Das  has failed  to show that  those later  reasons were\n\npremised  upon  discriminatory  motive.   As  we  have stated\n\nbefore:  \"Since an  employer's nondiscriminatory  motivations\n\nfor adverse  employment decisions  are irrelevant  in an  age\n\ndiscrimination  case, a  `mere  showing  that the  employer's\n\narticulated    reason    may   shield    another    (possibly\n\nnondiscriminatory)  reason  does  not  create  a  dispute  of\n\nmaterial  fact' sufficient  to  withstand summary  judgment.\"\n\n                             -6-\n\nGoldman,   985  F.2d  at  1118  n.4  (quoting  Villanueva  v.\n                                                         \n\nWellesley  College, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558945\"><a href=\"/opinion/558945/tino-villanueva-v-wellesley-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  128  (1st  Cir.),  cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He argues that hiring criteria which impermissibly\n\nfavor a minimum number of years of work experience make age a\n\ndetermining  factor in the selection process and, because age\n\nand experience  are directly  related, effectively  eliminate\n\nall applicants over 40 years of age.  The Biggins decision is\n                                                 \n\ninstructive  on this  point.   In deciding  that a  dismissal\n\nbased   solely  on  pension  status  was  not  discriminatory\n\ntreatment on  the basis of  age for ADEA purposes,  the Court\n\nemphasized  that  \"[b]ecause  age and  years  of  service are\n\nanalytically  distinct, an employer  can take account  of one\n\nwhile ignoring  the other,  and thus it  is incorrect  to say\n\nthat a  decision based  on years  of  service is  necessarily\n\n`age-based'.\"  Biggins,  113 S. Ct.  at 1707.   Consequently,\n                      \n\nthe ADEA  is  not violated  when  the factor  motivating  the\n\nemployment decision merely correlates  with age, i.e.,  gives\n\nrise to a  permissive and not a necessary inference.  By like\n\ntoken, having failed to show  that age actually played a role\n\nin the decision not to hire him, Das may not, under  Biggins,\n                                                            \n\nask  us to  presume that  the employer's  decision to  hire a\n\ncandidate   with  significantly   less  work   experience  is\n\n                             -7-\n\nautomatically age-based.  As Biggins makes plain, even if, as\n                                    \n\nDas speculates, older  workers are likely to  have more years\n\nof work experience, Ciba's decision to hire an engineer  with\n\nthree  years of  desired experience  does  not, without  more\n\nevidence  than is offered here, implicate the prohibitions of\n\nthe ADEA.2\n\n                              II\n                                \n\n          We turn to  the issue of sanctions.  In  Das II, we\n                                                         \n\nupheld a $1420 award of attorneys' fees and costs against Das\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 11.  Here, Ciba contended that  Das had\n\nviolated  Rule 11  by  irresponsibly maintaining  this action\n\nafter  three  similar  (and  similarly meritless)  complaints\n\nagainst  other corporate defendants had been dismissed.  Ciba\n\nsought attorneys' fees  and costs in excess of  $12,000.  The\n\ndistrict court found that Das' claims, filed in October 1989,\n\nwere  brought in good  faith and were  objectively reasonable\n\nuntil the filing of his cross motion for summary judgment one\n\nyear  later.    By that  time,  Das  I and  Das  II  had been\n                                                   \n\ndismissed in the  district court, and Das had  reason to know\n\nthat his  cross motion was  neither well founded in  fact nor\n\nwarranted in existing  law.  Taking into account  Das' pro se\n                                                             \n\nstatus,   the  court  concluded  that  a  $250  sanction  was\n\n                    \n\n2.  Nor  do we  read Das'  complaint  to state  a claim  that\nCiba's  facially  neutral hiring  practices impact  older job\napplicants  more harshly.   The  Court has  not  recognized a\n\"disparate  impact\"  theory  of  liability  under  the  ADEA.\nBiggins, 113 S. Ct. at 1706.\n       \n\n                             -8-\n\nappropriate.
