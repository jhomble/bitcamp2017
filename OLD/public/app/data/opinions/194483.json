Smith on Motion for Stay, for petitioner.\n                      \n     Joseph A. Conte  on Response in  Opposition to  Petitioner's\n                    \nMotion for Stay, for respondents.\n\n                                          \n\n                                          \n\n          Per  Curiam.   Petitioner  moves  for  a stay,  pending\n                     \n\nreview,  of an order issued by the National Transportation Safety\n\nBoard [\"NTSB\"] affirming revocation  of his air transport pilot's\n\ncertificate.     We  conclude  that  petitioner   has  not  shown\n\nsufficient reason for  such extraordinary relief, and  so we deny\n\nthe stay.\n\n       Petitioner's  certificate was  initially  revoked  by  the\n\nFederal  Aviation Administration  [\"the Administrator\"]  in June,\n\n1989, following an incident in which an aircraft he was piloting,\n\ncarrying  a  number  of high  school  athletes  and their  coach,\n\nexperienced severe control difficulty and was forced to return to\n\nits take-off point in Hyannis.   The Administrator attributed the\n\nincident   to  petitioner's   misfeasance  and   recklessness  in\n\noperating an  unairworthy aircraft  in violation  of a  number of\n\nregulations.    The  Administrator  claimed that  the  plane  was\n\nimproperly loaded beyond  its weight and center of gravity limits\n\nwhen, shortly before take-off, the plane's tail fell back and hit\n\nthe ground  sharply, causing  damage to  the  tail and  controls.\n\nAllegedly petitioner was present when this  occurred, but he then\n\ntook  the  plane into  the air  without  testing the  controls or\n\ncorrecting its out-of-balance condition. \n\n        Petitioner denied the charges.  He appealed to the  NTSB,\n\nthus gaining an automatic  stay of the revocation order  under 49\n\nU.S.C. app.   1429(a).  An evidentiary hearing was held before an\n\nadministrative  law judge  [\"ALJ\"], who credited  the passengers'\n\ntestimony over petitioner's version, finding sufficient proof for\n\nall  but  one  of  the  violations  charged.  1  Petitioner  then\n\nappealed to  the  full  Board,  which  reviewed  the  record  and\n\naffirmed in an opinion issued August 10, 1992.  The Board ordered\n\nrevocation of  petitioner's certificate  to begin within  30 days\n\nfrom the date of service of its order.\n\n       The NTSB also denied  petitioner's subsequent motion for a\n\nfurther  stay of  the revocation  order pending  this  appeal, in\n\naccordance with the agency's long-standing practice in revocation\n\ncases.   As explained by the NTSB, revocation, unlike suspension,\n\n\"is  based  on  the  conclusion  that  the  airman's  conduct  is\n\nsufficiently  egregious   as  to   demonstrate  a  lack   of  the\n\nqualifications required  of a certificate holder.\"  Administrator\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Hite,  N.T.S.B.  Order  EA-3701,  (Oct.  23,  1992)  (quoting\n        \n\nAdministrator  v. Balestra,  N.T.S.B.  Order  EA-3065, 1990  NTSB\n                          \n\nLEXIS 3  (Jan. 9,  1990)).   Denial of  a stay  in such  cases is\n\npremised  on  the belief  that  \"aviation safety  and  the public\n\ninterest would  be compromised by permitting  an individual whose\n\nconduct demonstrates  that he lacks the  necessary care, judgment\n\nand  responsibility to  continue,  pending  judicial  review,  to\n\nexercise  the privileges of a certificate he has been found unfit\n\nto hold.\"   Administrator v.

On this motion we have not been provided with a copy  of the\nhearing transcript nor  the ALJ's opinion, and so we  rely on the\ndescription of the record in the Board's affirming decision.  The\none charge  which the  ALJ did  not find to  be supported  by the\nevidence  was  that  petitioner  had not  promptly  reported  the\nincident. \n\n                               -3-\n\nNTSB  LEXIS  117  (July  16,  1991); see  also  Administrator  v.\n                                                             \n\nPalmersheim,  N.T.S.B. Order  EA-3421,  1991 NTSB  204 (Oct.  22,\n           \n\n1991); Administrator v. Damsky, 3 N.T.S.B. 557 (1977).\n                              \n\n       Petitioner urges  that (1) under the  Federal Aviation Act\n\n(the \"Act\") he is entitled to an automatic stay of the NTSB order\n\nduring the pendency  of his appeal in this court,  and (2) in the\n\nalternative,  this court  should  exercise  its equitable  powers\n\nunder Fed. R. App. P. 18, to grant a stay.\n\n       (1) Argument for an Automatic Stay \n                                         \n\n       Under   609 of the Act, 49 U.S.C. app.   1429(a), when the\n\nAdministrator  issues an order amending, modifying, suspending or\n\nrevoking a  certificate,2 the  certificate holder is  entitled to\n\nnotice, an opportunity to answer, be heard, and a right to review\n\nby  the NTSB.3  During  these proceedings, there  is an automatic\n\nstay  of the  effectiveness  of the  Administrator's  order.   An\n\nexception   to  the  automatic  stay   is  allowed  only  if  the\n\nAdministrator  advises the NTSB  that an \"emergency\"  exists.  In\n\nthat event  the Administrator's order is  given immediate effect,\n\nand  the  NTSB's review  is  expedited, requiring  the  agency to\n\nfinally dispose of the case within sixty days. \n\n                    \n\n2.   Section 1429 is directed to the Secretary of Transportation,\nbut under  49 U.S.C.     106(g), all  duties  and powers  of  the\nSecretary  relating to aviation safety are carried out by the FAA\nAdministrator. \n\n3.    The  NTSB treats  the initial  FAA  order much  as a  civil\ncomplaint.   After  the  preliminaries, there  is an  evidentiary\nhearing before an ALJ, and a right to review by the full Board.\n\n                               -4-\n\n       Petitioner perceives in the  design of   1429(a)  a unique\n\nprocedure extending to appeals to this court.  He argues that the\n\nstay of the Administrator's  order, automatically imposed in most\n\ncases pending an evidentiary hearing and review by the NTSB, also\n\nautomatically stays any final NTSB  order appealed to this court.\n\nPetitioner gleans support for this reading of the Act in the lack\n\nof  any direct statutory statement  as to how  the automatic stay\n\nterminates, combined with the last  sentence of   1429(a),  which\n\nallows for  judicial review of NTSB orders, \"under the provisions\n\nof    1486.\"4  According to  petitioner, this  means that  at the\n\nagency level,    1429(a)  vests \"exclusive power\"  to \"deny\"  any\n\nstay of the NTSB's  final orders in the Administrator,  who makes\n\nthe decision by declaring an \"emergency\" before the NTSB hearing.\n\n     Petitioner   has   pointed   to   no  authority   for   this\n\ninterpretation, nor any direct evidence of Congressional purpose.\n\nHe  simply infers from the  absence of any  explicit statement to\n\nthe  contrary that the  NTSB has no  power to effectuate  its own\n\norders, even to  protect the public  interest and safety,  during\n\noft-times protracted appeals.  \n\n                    \n\n4.   Title 49  U.S.C. app.   1486 shifts to  this court exclusive\npower  over  the orders  of the  NTSB  and Administrator  once an\nappeal  is  filed. After  notice  to  the agency,  \"interlocutory\nrelief  may be granted by  a stay\" or  other appropriate mandate.\nThe procedure envisioned by  this section also seems inconsistent\nwith the  assumptions underlying petitioner's  argument about the\nmeaning of   1429(a). \n\n                               -5-\n\n       We  reject petitioner's  counter-intuitive interpretation.\n\nWe read the statute, instead, as embracing traditional and common\n\nunderstandings.    By imposing  an  automatic  stay during  fact-\n\nfinding,  the statute  preserves the  normal balance  between the\n\nindividual's due process  rights and the public  interest in most\n\ncases, subject to the Administrator's \"emergency\" declaration and\n\nan expedited hearing in exceptional circumstances.  Cf. Gallagher\n                                                                 \n\nv. NTSB, 953 F.2d  1214, 1224-25 (10th Cir. 1992) (  1429 creates\n       \n\nan extraordinary  class of  emergency order petitioners  who lose\n\nthe  usual procedural rights during the 60-day period in order to\n\nprotect the  public safety).  We  have no reason to  believe that\n\nCongress  intended to denude the  NTSB of the  ability to protect\n\nthe public  interest in the larger number of cases, once the full\n\npanoply of  procedural rights had  been accorded.   Other courts,\n\ntoo, have assumed the NTSB's role in protecting the public.   Cf.\n                                                                 \n\nGrant  v.  NTSB,  959 F.2d  1483,  1485  (9th  Cir. 1992)  (since\n               \n\npredominant  purpose of     1429 is  to  promote air  safety,  in\n\nemergency  cases  ways  must  be  sought  by  NTSB  to  vindicate\n\nindividual's right to fair  decisional process without  impairing\n\nstatute's mandate). \n\n       In accordance with usual  practice, the NTSB's final order\n\nof   revocation,   following    a   fact-finding   hearing    and\n\nadministrative review is fully  effective on appeal unless stayed\n\nby  that agency or this court.  See Administrative Procedure Act,\n                                   \n\n5 U.S.C.   705  (agency has authority to postpone  effective date\n\n                               -6-\n\nof its own order when \"justice so requires\"); Fed. R.  App. P. 18\n\n(application for  a stay of agency  action must be  made in first\n\ninstance to agency).   \n\n       Petitioner's  related argument  that he  is entitled  to a\n\nstay  because the  NTSB did  not publish  a rule  in the  Code of\n\nFederal Regulations  stating the  agency's authority to  stay its\n\nown  orders,  is also  specious.    Publication  in  the  Federal\n\nRegister  is  not  required  where  the  practice,  as  here,  is\n\ntraditional,  longstanding,  and  follows  the  course of  events\n\nclearly contemplated in the  Administrative Procedure Act and the\n\nFederal Aviation  Act.  See  Rochna v.  NTSB, 929 F.2d  13, 15-16\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 305 (1991).   Petitioner had\n                        \n\nactual  notice  of  the  policy  and  full  opportunity  to  take\n\nadvantage  of it,  which he  in fact  did, by  moving for  a stay\n\nbefore the  NTSB.  Thus there is  no plausible due process claim.\n\nRochna, 929 F.2d at 16. 5  \n      \n\n       (2) Argument for a Stay under Fed. R. App. P. 18\n                                                       \n\n       Petitioner also  fails to make an adequate showing for the\n\nextraordinary  remedy of a stay pending appeal under Fed. R. App.\n\nP.  18.6  Motions for  a stay of an  agency order are governed by\n\n                    \n\n5.      This  is  the  same  argument  we  addressed  in  Rochna.\n                                                                 \nPetitioner's counsel here also represented the petitioner in that\ncase, and in other cases cited therein, where the courts rejected\nthe same argument in identical fashion.   \n\n6.   Petitioner does not urge upon us the  authority of 49 U.S.C.\napp.   1486, although it expressly provides parallel authority to\nthis court  to stay NTSB orders  for \"good cause shown\".   As the\nfactors considered would  be the same as  under Rule 18,  in this\n\n                               -7-\n\nthe  same considerations  as motions  for an  injunction pendente\n\nlite.  9 James  W.

The relative\n                               \n\nweight assigned to  each factor necessarily  varies from case  to\n\ncase.  Cuomo, 772 F.2d at 974. \n            \n\n       The public's  interest in  air safety  is  of obvious  and\n\nparamount importance in this  case.  Petitioner ingenuously urges\n\nthat safety is not in issue, however, because the Administrator's\n\n                    \n\ncase there appears  to be no practical reason  to prefer one over\nthe other.  See Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Civil Aeronautics Bd.,\n                                                                \n261 F.2d 830 (2d  Cir. 1958) (citing factors, denying  stay under\npredecessor  version of  Act,); Air  Line Pilots  Ass'n Int'l  v.\n                                                             \nCivil  Aeronautics  Bd., 215  F.2d  122 (2d  Cir.  1954) (denying\n                       \ninterlocutory stay of implementation of special air regulation). \n\n                               -8-\n\nchoice not to  use his  emergency power  to suspend  petitioner's\n\ncertificate  in advance of the NTSB review \"certified\" that there\n\nwas  no risk  to  the public.    This reasoning  exaggerates  and\n\ndistorts  the  meaning of  the  Administrator's early  processing\n\ndecision.  Especially in a case  where the facts are in  dispute,\n\nif  any   relevant  inference  can   later  be  drawn   from  the\n\nAdministrator's   processing  choice,   it  is   only  that   the\n\nAdministrator  chose not to  implement his order  until the facts\n\nhad been fully aired before the NTSB.  \n\n       Aside from  the public safety  issue, petitioner's  claims\n\nunder  the  remaining   factors  are  not  convincing.     As  to\n\nirreparable  harm to  petitioner and  harm to  others, petitioner\n\nrelies solely  upon his  counsel's affidavit, which  advises that\n\npetitioner's only  source of support is  a \"one-man, one-aircraft\n\non-demand air-taxi  service.\"  This service,  counsel states, was\n\nput together by a  \"small group of businessmen, who  require air-\n\ntransportation  from time to  time, with the  specific purpose of\n\nhaving  [petitioner] as their pilot.\"  Even giving full credit to\n\nthis  recitation   as  an   accurate  depiction  of   the  facts,\n\nnevertheless we do not understand how denial of a stay will cause\n\npetitioner  or  his  unnamed  business  associates  \"irreparable\"\n\ninjury. \"The key word in this consideration is irreparable.

Cir. 1958)). \n\n       We do  not doubt  that economic dislocation  may accompany\n\nrevocation of petitioner's certificate, perhaps necessitating the\n\nhiring of a substitute  pilot.  And we can  imagine circumstances\n\nin which some  of the loss will not be  readily compensable.  But\n\nthis   is  not  the  type  of  injury  which  would  justify  the\n\nextraordinary appellate intervention  requested here,  especially\n\nin  the absence of  any showing  of a  high probability  of later\n\nsuccess  on  the  merits  of  this appeal.

Instead, the initial  FAA order recites  that because of\n\nthe listed  safety violations  the Administrator  \"has determined\n\nthat safety in air  commerce ... and the public  interest require\n\nthe revocation.\"  And the NTSB expressly held  that denial of the\n\nrequested stay was predicated on the conclusion that petitioner's\n\nconduct  demonstrated \"a lack of the qualifications required of a\n\ncertificate holder.\" \n\n                    \n\n7.

Petitioner  moves  for  a stay,  pending\n                     \n\nreview,  of an order issued by the National Transportation Safety\n\nBoard [\"NTSB\"] affirming revocation  of his air transport pilot's\n\ncertificate.     We  conclude  that  petitioner   has  not  shown\n\nsufficient reason for  such extraordinary relief, and  so we deny\n\nthe stay.\n\n       Petitioner's  certificate was  initially  revoked  by  the\n\nFederal  Aviation Administration  [\"the Administrator\"]  in June,\n\n1989, following an incident in which an aircraft he was piloting,\n\ncarrying  a  number  of high  school  athletes  and their  coach,\n\nexperienced severe control difficulty and was forced to return to\n\nits take-off point in Hyannis.   The Administrator attributed the\n\nincident   to  petitioner's   misfeasance  and   recklessness  in\n\noperating an  unairworthy aircraft  in violation  of a  number of\n\nregulations.    The  Administrator  claimed that  the  plane  was\n\nimproperly loaded beyond  its weight and center of gravity limits\n\nwhen, shortly before take-off, the plane's tail fell back and hit\n\nthe ground  sharply, causing  damage to  the  tail and  controls.\n\nAllegedly petitioner was present when this  occurred, but he then\n\ntook  the  plane into  the air  without  testing the  controls or\n\ncorrecting its out-of-balance condition. \n\n        Petitioner denied the charges.  He appealed to the  NTSB,\n\nthus gaining an automatic  stay of the revocation order  under 49\n\nU.S.C. app.   1429(a).  An evidentiary hearing was held before an\n\nadministrative  law judge  [\"ALJ\"], who credited  the passengers'\n\ntestimony over petitioner's version, finding sufficient proof for\n\nall  but  one  of  the  violations  charged.  1  Petitioner  then\n\nappealed to  the  full  Board,  which  reviewed  the  record  and\n\naffirmed in an opinion issued August 10, 1992.  The Board ordered\n\nrevocation of  petitioner's certificate  to begin within  30 days\n\nfrom the date of service of its order.\n\n       The NTSB also denied  petitioner's subsequent motion for a\n\nfurther  stay of  the revocation  order pending  this  appeal, in\n\naccordance with the agency's long-standing practice in revocation\n\ncases.   As explained by the NTSB, revocation, unlike suspension,\n\n\"is  based  on  the  conclusion  that  the  airman's  conduct  is\n\nsufficiently  egregious   as  to   demonstrate  a  lack   of  the\n\nqualifications required  of a certificate holder.\"  Administrator\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Denial of  a stay  in such  cases is\n\npremised  on  the belief  that  \"aviation safety  and  the public\n\ninterest would  be compromised by permitting  an individual whose\n\nconduct demonstrates  that he lacks the  necessary care, judgment\n\nand  responsibility to  continue,  pending  judicial  review,  to\n\nexercise  the privileges of a certificate he has been found unfit\n\nto hold.\"   Administrator v.

R. App. P. 18, to grant a stay.\n\n       (1) Argument for an Automatic Stay \n                                         \n\n       Under   609 of the Act, 49 U.S.C. app.   1429(a), when the\n\nAdministrator  issues an order amending, modifying, suspending or\n\nrevoking a  certificate,2 the  certificate holder is  entitled to\n\nnotice, an opportunity to answer, be heard, and a right to review\n\nby  the NTSB.3  During  these proceedings, there  is an automatic\n\nstay  of the  effectiveness  of the  Administrator's  order.   An\n\nexception   to  the  automatic  stay   is  allowed  only  if  the\n\nAdministrator  advises the NTSB  that an \"emergency\"  exists.  In\n\nthat event  the Administrator's order is  given immediate effect,\n\nand  the  NTSB's review  is  expedited, requiring  the  agency to\n\nfinally dispose of the case within sixty days. \n\n                    \n\n2.   Section 1429 is directed to the Secretary of Transportation,\nbut under  49 U.S.C.     106(g), all  duties  and powers  of  the\nSecretary  relating to aviation safety are carried out by the FAA\nAdministrator. \n\n3.    The  NTSB treats  the initial  FAA  order much  as a  civil\ncomplaint.   After  the  preliminaries, there  is an  evidentiary\nhearing before an ALJ, and a right to review by the full Board.\n\n                               -4-\n\n       Petitioner perceives in the  design of   1429(a)  a unique\n\nprocedure extending to appeals to this court.  He argues that the\n\nstay of the Administrator's  order, automatically imposed in most\n\ncases pending an evidentiary hearing and review by the NTSB, also\n\nautomatically stays any final NTSB  order appealed to this court.\n\nPetitioner gleans support for this reading of the Act in the lack\n\nof  any direct statutory statement  as to how  the automatic stay\n\nterminates, combined with the last  sentence of   1429(a),  which\n\nallows for  judicial review of NTSB orders, \"under the provisions\n\nof    1486.\"4  According to  petitioner, this  means that  at the\n\nagency level,    1429(a)  vests \"exclusive power\"  to \"deny\"  any\n\nstay of the NTSB's  final orders in the Administrator,  who makes\n\nthe decision by declaring an \"emergency\" before the NTSB hearing.\n\n     Petitioner   has   pointed   to   no  authority   for   this\n\ninterpretation, nor any direct evidence of Congressional purpose.\n\nHe  simply infers from the  absence of any  explicit statement to\n\nthe  contrary that the  NTSB has no  power to effectuate  its own\n\norders, even to  protect the public  interest and safety,  during\n\noft-times protracted appeals.  \n\n                    \n\n4.   Title 49  U.S.C. app.   1486 shifts to  this court exclusive\npower  over  the orders  of the  NTSB  and Administrator  once an\nappeal  is  filed. After  notice  to  the agency,  \"interlocutory\nrelief  may be granted by  a stay\" or  other appropriate mandate.\nThe procedure envisioned by  this section also seems inconsistent\nwith the  assumptions underlying petitioner's  argument about the\nmeaning of   1429(a). \n\n                               -5-\n\n       We  reject petitioner's  counter-intuitive interpretation.\n\nWe read the statute, instead, as embracing traditional and common\n\nunderstandings.    By imposing  an  automatic  stay during  fact-\n\nfinding,  the statute  preserves the  normal balance  between the\n\nindividual's due process  rights and the public  interest in most\n\ncases, subject to the Administrator's \"emergency\" declaration and\n\nan expedited hearing in exceptional circumstances.

But\n\nthis   is  not  the  type  of  injury  which  would  justify  the\n\nextraordinary appellate intervention  requested here,  especially\n\nin  the absence of  any showing  of a  high probability  of later\n\nsuccess  on  the  merits  of  this appeal.
