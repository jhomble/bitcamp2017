Therefore, we   examine the\n\nInformation as  a whole to determine  whether it sufficiently\n\ncharges the offense proscribed by the conspiracy statute.\n\n                             II.\n\n                       The Information\n                                      \n\n        To  begin, we  summarize the  key allegations  of the\n\nInformation.    The government's  allegations  concerning the\n\ndefendants' conspiracy to defraud  the United States focus on\n\nthe  MBE  programs  of  several federal  agencies,  the  U.S.\n\nDepartment   of  Transportation  (DOT),    the  Environmental\n\nProtection   Agency   (EPA),   and   the   General   Services\n\nAdministration (GSA).    These federal  agencies intended the\n\nMBE   programs   to     \"support[]   the   fullest   possible\n\nparticipation of firms owned and controlled by certain racial\n\nminorities and women in  the construction programs funded and\n\nassisted by these departments  and agencies.\"  Information at\n\n  6.   To that end, the MBE programs required that recipients\n\nof funds from federal agencies establish goals or set aside a\n\npercentage  of  federal  funds   received  for  contracts  to\n\ncertified MBE businesses.  Information at   7.  \n\n                             -4-\n\n        Federal agencies with  MBE programs  rely upon  state\n\nand local  governments  to certify  applicants  as  qualified\n\nminority businesses.  Information at   9.  To qualify for MBE\n\ncertification, at least fifty-one percent of the ownership of\n\nthe enterprise  must be by  certain minority groups,  and the\n\nminority owners must also control the daily operations of the\n\nbusiness.   Information at   6. To implement the MBE program,\n\nthe  entity  receiving federal  agency funding  hires general\n\ncontractors  to   perform  the   work,  who  in   turn  award\n\nsubcontracts to  certified MBEs  to meet the  percentage goal\n\nfor the project.   For  subcontract work to  qualify for  MBE\n\ngoals or  set aside  contracts, the  MBE certified  firm must\n\nperform a  \"commercially useful function in  the execution of\n\nthe project by actually  performing, managing and supervising\n\nthe work involved.\"  Information at   10.  For  materials and\n\nsupplies  to qualify,  the  MBE certified  firm must  \"either\n\nproduce the  goods from raw materials  or substantially alter\n\nthe goods before reselling them.\"  Information at   10.\n\n        The  Information alleges  that  from  about  October,\n\n1982,  until  at  least  July,  1986,  Barker  Steel  Company\n\n(Barker)   and   its   president,   director   and   majority\n\nstockholder, Robert B.  Brack (Brack), conspired with  others\n\nto use Rusco Steel Company (Rusco) as a front  company to win\n\nMBE set aside  contracts for  Barker.  Information  at    13.\n\nBarker   was  a  Massachusetts  corporation  which  furnished\n\n                             -5-\n\nfabricated  steel  reinforcing   bars  (re-bars)  and   other\n\nproducts to the construction industry throughout New England.\n\nBarker was never  a certified MBE.  Information at     1, 11.\n\nRusco,  located in Rhode Island, had been certified as an MBE\n\nin  several  states before  the  scheme  with the  defendants\n\nbegan.  Information at    3, 15.\n\n        The  steel  re-bar  industry  includes  two  distinct\n\nfunctions:  fabricators and erectors.  Firms which operate as\n\nfabricators   \"cut  and   bend  the   re-bars  to   meet  the\n\nspecifications of a particular construction project and  then\n\ndeliver the  re-bars to the construction  site.\"  Information\n\nat   5.   The industry term for the  work done by fabricators\n\nis \"furnish\" work.  Id.   Firms known as erectors  \"place the\n                       \n\nfabricated re-bars within  the forms, at the  job site, prior\n\nto  the  pouring  of the  concrete.\"    Information  at    5.\n\nErector firms do \"erection\" work.  Id. \n                                      \n\n        In  October,  1982,  Barker  agreed  with  Rusco that\n\nBarker  would finance  a new  division of Rusco  for erecting\n\nsteel re-bar, \"erection\" work.   Information at    5, 16.  In\n\nexchange,  Rusco  would  allow  Barker to  market  its  steel\n\nproducts through Rusco for re-bar \"furnish\" contracts to take\n\nadvantage of  Rusco's MBE  certification.  Information  at   \n\n13,  16.  Prior  to 1982, Rusco  had operated as  a broker of\n\nsteel re-bar but had not fabricated re-bar or erected re-bar.\n\nInformation at    15.   Beginning  in 1982, Barker  employees\n\n                             -6-\n\nmanaged all aspects of the fabrication, sales and shipping of\n\nsteel  re-bar and  other  products in  its  own name  and  in\n\nRusco's  name  when  contracts  required  MBE  certification.\n\nInformation at     16, 19,  20.  Barker  employees and  Brack\n\nexercised  substantial  control  over  Rusco  throughout this\n\nperiod.  Information at     22, 25.  In 1985,  the defendants\n\nmerged a subsidiary  company into Rusco, to deceive state MBE\n\ncertifying   agencies  about  Rusco's   eligibility  for  MBE\n\ncertification.  Information at    25, 43.\n\n        As part of the scheme, Rusco submitted  documentation\n\nto  various  state and  local  agencies  for  the purpose  of\n\nobtaining   or   maintaining   certification   as   an   MBE.\n\nInformation at    32, 26, 41, 47.  The documents submitted by\n\nRusco  contained false, misleading  and fraudulent statements\n\nas well as material omissions. Id.  The Information concludes\n                                  \n\nthat as a result of the  conspiracy, more than $5 million  in\n\nfederally   funded   and   federally  assisted   construction\n\ncontracts were improperly credited  toward MBE goals when the\n\ncontracts actually  benefitted Barker,  which was not  an MBE\n\nfirm.  Information at   15.  The conspiracy, according to the\n\nInformation, impeded,  impaired, obstructed and  defeated the\n\nimplementation,  execution  and  administration  of  the  MBE\n\nprograms of DOT, EPA and GSA.  Information at   12.\n\n                             III.\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n                             -7-\n\n        The district court  dismissed the Information on  the\n\ngrounds  that:   (1) it failed  to allege a  violation by the\n\ndefendants  of any  MBE  program statute;    (2) it  did  not\n\nclearly state a violation by the defendants of a duty owed to\n\nthe federal  government, and (3)  it failed to  allege direct\n\ncontact with  federal agencies.  The  defendants contend that\n\nbecause the MBE program does not impose criminal penalties or\n\nany obligations upon them, they  were not fairly warned  that\n\nthe  conduct alleged  in the  Information could give  rise to\n\ncriminal charges.  In further support of the dismissal of the\n\nInformation,  the defendants  add that their  alleged conduct\n\nwas  not  fraud  because  it  did  not  deprive  the  federal\n\ngovernment of any money or property.  The government counters\n\nthat the  Information properly and sufficiently  alleged that\n\nthe defendants conspired to defraud the federal government in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   371.\n\n           A.  Legal Sufficiency of the Information\n                                                   \n\n        The Information charges that the defendants conspired\n\nwith others to defraud  the United States in violation  of 18\n\nU.S.C.   371.   The pertinent  language of   371  provides as\n\nfollows:\n\n            If two or  more persons conspire either\n          to commit any offense against  the United\n          States,  or to defraud the United States,\n          or any  agency thereof in  any manner  or\n          for any purpose, and  one or more of such\n          persons do any  act to effect  the object\n          of the conspiracy each shall be fined not\n\n                             -8-\n\n          more  than $10,000 or imprisoned not more\n          than five years, or both.\n\n18  U.S.C.    371.   To sufficiently  charge a  conspiracy to\n\ndefraud,  the Information  must  allege  the three  essential\n\nelements  of  section  371:    \"an  agreement,  the  unlawful\n\nobjective of the agreement,  and an overt act  in furtherance\n\nof the  agreement.\"  United  States v.

The\n\nInformation also  includes  detailed factual  allegations  to\n\nsubstantiate   the  cursory   statutory  allegations.     The\n\ndefendants conspired with Rusco and others to establish Rusco\n\nas  a front company which  the defendants used  to obtain MBE\n\nset   aside  contracts   for  furnishing   steel  re-bar   on\n\nconstruction  projects funded  in part  by federal  agencies.\n\nThe  defendant corporation, Barker,  was not an  MBE and was,\n\ntherefore, not entitled to MBE contracts.  Although Rusco may\n\nhave  been a properly certified  MBE at one  time, during the\n\nrelevant period of the  defendants' scheme, they financed and\n\ncontrolled Rusco,  thereby destroying  its eligibility as  an\n\nMBE.   Rusco  maintained its  MBE certification  by supplying\n\nfalse  and misleading  documentation to  certifying agencies.\n\nWe  continue   our  analysis   of  the  sufficiency   of  the\n\nInformation to determine whether    371 provided fair warning\n\nto the  defendants that  their conduct, as  alleged, violated\n\nthe statute.\n\n       B.  Sufficiency of the Allegations of Conspiracy\n                                                       \n\n        The defendants  do not contend  that the  Information\n\nfailed  to allege a conspiracy, nor did the district court so\n\nfind, and we find no deficiency.   \"The gist of conspiracy is\n\nan agreement to  disobey or  to disregard the  law.\"   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.

Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14,  19 (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n                             -10-\n\n1991);  Penagaricano-Soler, 911 F.2d at 840.  The Information\n                          \n\nalleges that the defendants  conspired with others, known and\n\nunknown,  to defraud  the government  and goes  on to  allege\n\nconduct by the defendants, their employees, Rusco, and others\n\nin furtherance of the conspiracy.    Information at   12  and\n\npassim.\n      \n\n        The defendants argue, however, that because Rusco was\n\nnot named or charged as a co-conspirator  in the Information,\n\nactions  by Rusco  cannot be  alleged to support  the charges\n\nagainst the defendants.   There  is no  requirement that  co-\n\nconspirators  be identified in an information, nor is there a\n\nrequirement  that co-conspirators  be charged  with  the same\n\noffense  to sustain  the  conviction  of one  co-conspirator.\n\nPenagaricano-Soler,  911 F.2d  at 840  n.5; United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nSachs, 801 F.2d 839, 845 (6th Cir. 1986).  Although  Rusco is\n     \n\nnot  charged or  named as  a co-conspirator,  the Information\n\nalleges action which includes Rusco as a participant with the\n\ndefendants  in  the scheme  to defraud  the  MBE programs.   \n\nInformation  at     13,  16.   The reasonable  inference from\n\nthose  allegations  is that  Rusco  was  operating  as a  co-\n\nconspirator.   Further, the Bill of  Particulars specifically\n\nidentifies Rusco as  a co-conspirator.3   It is well  settled\n\n                    \n\n3  While  a  bill  of particulars  cannot  cure  a  defective\nindictment, it can provide  notice of detail missing  from an\ninformation.     See  Fed.  R. Crim.  P.  7(e); 1  Charles A.\n                    \nWright,  Federal Practice  and  Procedure Criminal 2d     129\n(1982);   United States v.

Pinkerton v.  United States,  328 U.S.  640, 646-47\n                                     \n\n(1945);  United States v.

Therefore, actions by Rusco to obtain or maintain MBE\n\ncertification  are  properly  alleged   as  elements  of  the\n\nconspiracy.  \n\n         C.  Sufficiency of the Allegations of Fraud\n                                                    \n\n        The  conspiracy  statute  proscribes   two  different\n\nconspiracies:  one to commit a specific offense, the \"offense\n\nclause,\" and the other  to defraud the United States  \"in any\n\nmanner or  for any purpose,\"  the \"defraud clause.\"   Hurley,\n                                                            \n\n957  F.2d  at  3.   The  defendants  were  charged under  the\n\n\"defraud clause\" of   371.  \n\n        At the start of our analysis, we acknowledge that the\n\ndefraud clause of    371 has been criticized for  its general\n\nlanguage  and  potentially broad  sweep.    Dennis v.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 384 U.S. 855, 860 (1966).  Further, because there are\n      \n\nno  common law  crimes  against the  United  States, we  must\n\ndetermine   whether  the   defendants'  alleged   conduct  is\n\n\"'plainly  and unmistakably' within  the province of [ 371].\"\n\n                    \n\nCir.  1989)   (observing  that  an  information,   unlike  an\nindictment,  may  be  easily  amended  absent  prejudice   to\ndefendants).\n\n                             -12-\n\nUnited States v.  Gradwell, 243  U.S. 476, 485  (1917).   We,\n                          \n\ntherefore, scrutinize the Information carefully  to determine\n\nwhether it sufficiently and properly alleges criminal conduct\n\nin violation of   371.  \n\n        The defendants  contend that they lacked fair warning\n\nthat the conduct alleged in the Information would violate the\n\ndefraud clause of    371.  The fair warning  doctrine invokes\n\ndue  process rights  under the  Fifth Amendment  and requires\n\nthat the  criminal statute at issue  be sufficiently definite\n\nto  notify   persons  of reasonable  intelligence that  their\n\nplanned conduct is  criminal.  United States v.  Harriss, 347\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  612,  617  (1953) (\"The  constitutional  requirement of\n\ndefiniteness is violated by a criminal statute that fails  to\n\ngive a person  of ordinary intelligence fair  notice that his\n\ncontemplated conduct is  forbidden by the statute.\");  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.  National Dairy  Corp.,  372 U.S.  29,  31 (1963);\n                                 \n\nUnited States v. Anzalone, 766 F.2d 676, 678 (1st Cir. 1985).\n                         \n\nWe  examine the statute,  as we must,  in the context  of the\n\nfacts of this case.   United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544,\n                                              \n\n550 (1975);  United States  v. Angiulo, 897  F.2d 1169,  1179\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir. 1990).  \n\n        The defendants assert that   371 did not provide fair\n\nwarning that their alleged actions defrauded the MBE programs\n\nof federal  government agencies because the  MBE programs did\n\nnot impose any duties on them.  The district court found that\n\n                             -13-\n\nthe  MBE  programs  did  not  impose  criminal  sanctions  or\n\npenalties, or any obligations  on subcontractors, such as the\n\ndefendants,  and held  that  because the  defendants had  not\n\nviolated any duty imposed upon them by the MBE programs, they\n\ncould not have violated   371.  The defendants primarily rely\n\non  United States v. Murphy,  809 F.2d 1427  (9th Cir. 1987);\n                           \n\nUnited  States v. Anzalone, 766 F.2d 676 (1st Cir. 1985), and\n                          \n\nUnited  States v. Porter, 591 F.2d 1048  (5th Cir. 1979).  We\n                        \n\nfind them inapposite to this case.  \n\n        In United States v. Anzalone, 766  F.2d 676 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1985), we addressed the problem of criminal prosecution of an\n\nindividual for alleged violations  of the currency  reporting\n\nrequirements before  the applicable statutes were  amended to\n\ninclude such transactions.  Anzalone  did not involve   371.4\n                                    \n\nThe government  claimed that  the defendant failed  to notify\n\nthe bank that  his deposits were part  of the same  event and\n\nshould have been reported as a \"structured\" transaction.  The\n\nessence of the government's charges was \"that the appellant's\n\nfailure  to inform the Bank of the 'structured' nature of his\n\ntransfers constituted an illegal scheme to avoid detection of\n\nthese payments by causing     the Bank to fail in its duty to\n\nreport them.\"  Id. at 679.  We held that  the defendant could\n                  \n\n                    \n\n4 The defendant was not charged under   371 and   371 was not\ndiscussed  in  the  case.    The  defendant  was charged  and\nconvicted  of violating 18 U.S.C.    2, 1001 and 31 U.S.C.   \n5313, 5322.\n\n                             -14-\n\nnot be held  criminally liable under  the crimes charged  for\n\nfailing  to report the transaction when the Reporting Act did\n\nnot impose a duty on him to do so.\n\n               Our   analysis   in    Anzalone   is    easily\n                                              \n\ndistinguishable from this case.  In addition to the fact that\n\nAnzalone does  not address    371, the defendant  was charged\n        \n\nwith a crime  for failure to  act.  As  we held in  Anzalone,\n                                                            \n\nomission can only  constitute a  crime if the  accused had  a\n\nduty  to  act.   In this  case,  however, the  defendants are\n\ncharged with defrauding the  government by their actions, not\n\nby failure to act, and therefore, the analysis in Anzalone is\n                                                          \n\ninapplicable. \n\n          Similarly, in  United  States  v. Murphy,  809 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1427 (9th  Cir. 1987),  the defendants' alleged  crimes arose\n\nfrom  their failure to act.  The defendants were charged with\n\nviolating   371 because they failed to disclose the source of\n\nthe  funds  they  deposited  which  the  government   alleged\n\nconstituted  a  conspiracy  to  impair the  function  of  the\n\nInternal Revenue Service  in the  collection of  taxes.   The\n\ncourt found  that the defendants had  honestly and accurately\n\ncompleted  the  currency   transactions  reports  which  were\n\nrequired, had no  duty to inform anyone of the  source of the\n\ndeposited money, and therefore  had not committed any illegal\n\nactivity.   The court, in dicta, suggested that violations of\n\n  371 require violation  of other criminal statutes.   Id. at\n                                                          \n\n                             -15-\n\n1432.  Moreover, the Ninth Circuit  has explained and limited\n\nits decision in Murphy:\n                      \n\n          Dicta  in  Murphy  can  be  construed  to\n                           \n          require  that  a conspiracy  charge under\n          section  371 be  based upon  conduct that\n          has   \"been    proscribed   by   criminal\n          statute.\"   Id.  Any such construction is\n                        \n          incorrect  in light of  Dennis.   We read\n                                        \n          Murphy  and  Varbel  [United   States  v.\n                                               \n          Varbel, 780  F.2d  758 (9th  Cir.  1986)]\n                \n          only   to   mean  that   a   section  371\n          conviction  may  not   be  based  upon  a\n          failure to volunteer information  that is\n          not   required  to  be  provided  to  the\n          government,  or  upon  the furnishing  of\n          correct  information;  such  acts do  not\n          sufficiently  impair  the functioning  of\n          the  government  to  support  a  criminal\n          conviction.\n\nUnited States v. Tuohey,  867 F.2d 534, 538 (9th  Cir. 1989).\n                       \n\nIn Tuohey, the  court held that  the government had  properly\n         \n\ncharged the defendants under   371 because the defendants had\n\nfailed to report currency  transactions as they were required\n\nto do by statute.\n\n          In   United States  v. Porter,  591 F.2d  1048 (5th\n                                       \n\nCir. 1979), the government  charged a group of doctors  and a\n\nlaboratory  operator with  Medicare fraud  and  conspiracy to\n\ndefraud the government  under    371.  On  appeal, the  court\n\nreversed  the  convictions   and  dismissed  the  indictments\n\nfinding  that  the government  had  not  properly charged  or\n\nproved a conspiracy to defraud the government under  371.  In\n\nsummary, the  government alleged that  the doctor  defendants\n\nhad  sent lab  work  to the  laboratory operator  defendant's\n\n                             -16-\n\nmanual laboratories because they received a payment for doing\n\nso, rather  than to  automated laboratories which  might have\n\nprocessed the work  more quickly and more  cheaply.  Although\n\nthe  facts relating  to the  practice which  provided payment\n\nback to the doctors are  complex, the effect was obvious--the\n\ndoctors  sent  their  lab  work  to  the  laboratories  which\n\nprovided the payments and  not to the automated laboratories.\n\nThe charges to Medicare, however,  were not increased by  the\n\npractice and were within  the guidelines for lab work  in the\n\narea, and the quality of the work was not an issue.  Further,\n\nthe  defendants   did  not   violate   any  Medicare   rules,\n\nregulations   or   other   requirements   by   using   manual\n\nlaboratories.   The  government  charged  that the  practice,\n\nnevertheless,  violated     371   because  it  defrauded  the\n\ngovernment's \"right to  have the  Medicare program  conducted\n\nhonestly  and  fairly.\"   Id.  at  1056.    The  government's\n                             \n\nallegations established that the defendants failed to use the\n\nmost cost effective laboratories, the automated laboratories,\n\nbut did not show  that the defendants were required to do so,\n\nand the allegations also  showed that the defendants complied\n\nwith the applicable  rules and regulations of  Medicare.  The\n\ncourt  found that  the  government  did  not prove  that  the\n\ndefendants  had  interfered  with  lawful  functions  of  the\n\nMedicare program  as required for criminal  liability under  \n\n371.\n\n                             -17-\n\n          None  of the  cases relied  upon by  the defendants\n\ninvolve  the  situation  before  us:    affirmative  acts  of\n\nmisrepresentation  and deceit  to  thwart the  operation  and\n\npurpose of a  government program.   Conspiracy to thwart  the\n\noperation and purpose of  a government program through deceit\n\nand trickery is prohibited by   371.  Hammerschmidt v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 265 U.S. 182, 188 (1924); United States v.

The essence of the  defendants' theory is that if no\n\nother federal law  or regulation proscribes alleged  conduct,\n\nthen the  defendants  cannot be  held criminally  responsible\n\npursuant to   371  because they  owe no duty  to the  federal\n\ngovernment.5       The   defendants'   theory    reflects   a\n\n                    \n\n5  This  theory  is  distinguishable from  United  States  v.\n                                                         \nMinarik, 875 F.2d 1186 (6th Cir. 1989),  where the defendants\n       \nwere  charged and convicted under the defraud clause of   371\nalthough  a specific  provision  of the  Tax Code  proscribed\ntheir  conduct.     In  Minarik  the   court  overturned  the\n                               \nconvictions on the  grounds that  the case  should have  been\nbrought  under the offense clause of   371 to avoid confusion\nto  the defendants  concerning  what conduct  was  considered\nillegal.\n\n                             -18-\n\nmisunderstanding  of  the function  of the  two clauses  of  \n\n371.6     If the  second clause  were interpreted  to require\n\ncommission  of a  specific offense,  it would  have the  same\n\nmeaning as the first clause thus rendering the second  clause\n\nredundant.    Whenever  possible,  we will  not  interpret  a\n\nstatute in such  a way  as to  cause redundancy.

The\n\ndefendants in  Hurley argued that the  indictment was invalid\n                     \n\nfor failing to charge them under the  offense clause of   371\n\nwith  specific  tax code  violations.    The defendants  also\n\nargued  that because  there  were no  laws prohibiting  their\n\nparticular money  laundering activities, they had  no duty to\n\nthe government under   371 not to engage in money laundering.\n\nWe found  that the defendants had engaged  in a long-standing\n\n                    \n\n6  The defendants'  theory   does not  raise the  due process\nproblems presented in  United States v.  Haga, 821 F.2d  1036\n                                             \n(5th Cir. 1987), where the defendants were charged  under the\noffense clause of   371 but were convicted, apparently, under\nthe defraud clause.\n\n                             -19-\n\nand  complex  conspiracy to  deceive  the IRS  rather  than a\n\nlimited  scheme proscribed  by a  single  section of  the tax\n\ncode.  We held  that the defraud clause was  properly charged\n\nbecause it can best address a conspiracy which encompasses  a\n\nbroad range of conduct for  the unlawful purpose of impairing\n\nthe function of the  IRS.  See also Dennis v.  United States,\n                                                            \n\n384 U.S. at 860  (holding that the  true nature of the  crime\n\nwas the entire conspiracy to falsely obtain benefits from the\n\nN.L.R.B., in violation  of    371, and not  merely the  false\n\nstatements  made in  furtherance  of the  conspiracy); United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Bucey, 876  F.2d at 1312-13  (holding  that actions\n               \n\nwhich  are  themselves  legal   may  constitute  a   criminal\n\nconspiracy in  violation of     371 if  they  are part  of  a\n\nconspiracy  to  obstruct by  deceit,  craft  or trickery  the\n\nlawful function of a government agency).\n\n        In the present case,  the government alleges that the\n\ndefendants concocted  an elaborate  scheme with Rusco  to use\n\nRusco as a front  company to procure MBE set  aside contracts\n\nfor steel re-bar furnish  work  which would actually  be done\n\nby the defendants.  The scheme, as alleged, began in 1982 and\n\ncontinued into  1986.   Although Rusco  was indicted  for the\n\nspecific offense  of filing false statements  in violation of\n\n18  U.S.C.    1001,  the defendants'  conspiracy  aimed at  a\n\nbroader goal,  impeding the purpose  and function of  the MBE\n\nprograms.   The  defendants' scheme  is the  kind  of complex\n\n                             -20-\n\nconspiracy which the defraud clause is intended to proscribe,\n\nand which  might not  be prosecuted adequately  by addressing\n\nseparate occurrences of illegal conduct.7  \n\n        The defendants  in Hurley fared no  better with their\n                                 \n\nsecond  argument.     They argued  that  because their  money\n\nlaundering  activities   were  not  prohibited   by  specific\n\nstatutes,   they  lacked  fair warning  that  they  could  be\n\nprosecuted  under the defraud clause  of   371.   We rejected\n\ntheir  argument and  held that  if the  \"defendants knowingly\n\nparticipated   in   laundering   drug  proceeds,   inevitably\n\nhindering the  IRS in  its ability  to collect  . .  . taxes,\n\ntheir   convictions   under    371's   defraud   clause   are\n\nunassailable.\"  Id.  at 4; accord  United States v.  Cambara,\n                                                            \n\n902 F.2d  144, 147 (1st  Cir. 1990) (\"The  conspiracy statute\n\ndoes not require that  unlawful means be used to  achieve the\n\nunlawful goal of the conspiracy.\").  \n\n                    \n\n7 In  Dennis, 384  U.S. 855, the defendants argued that  they\n            \nshould have been charged, if at all, under the offense clause\nof     371  for  the  substantive  offense  of  making  false\nstatements  but   for  the  time   bar  of  the   statute  of\nlimitations.   The Court  held, however, that  the charge  of\nconspiracy  to defraud  the  government  properly stated  the\nnature  of the defendants' offense and was not \"an attempt by\nprosecutorial sleight of hand  to overcome a time bar.\"   Id.\n                                                             \nat 863.  In this  case, we also reject the  defendants' claim\nthat  the government  resorted  to    371  to circumvent  the\nstatute of limitations barring a charge pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n   1001.  As in Dennis, while  it is true that the defendants\n                      \nmay  have violated   1001 in  perpetration of the conspiracy,\nthe gravamen of the  charge is the scheme to  defraud the MBE\nprogram and not merely the making of false statements.\n\n                             -21-\n\n        Taken as  a whole,  the Information charges  that the\n\nMBE re-bar \"furnish\" contracts  obtained in Rusco's name were\n\nmerely passing through  Rusco, as  a front, to  Barker.   The\n\ndefendants used  Rusco to win MBE contracts  to \"furnish\" re-\n\nbar  because the  defendants  could not  have obtained  those\n\ncontracts  directly.  The result  was that a  non-MBE got the\n\nbenefit  of  contracts which  the  MBE  program intended  for\n\nminority businesses.   Both  the defendants and  the district\n\ncourt below rely on the  fact that Rusco was a certified  MBE\n\nduring  the  existence  of  the  conspiracy,  implying   that\n\ncontracts  which went to Rusco were proper under the affected\n\nMBE programs.  \n\n        A  scheme to  use  a  minority  business as  a  front\n\ncompany was addressed in United  States v. Anderson, 879 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n369  (8th  Cir. 1989).   The  court  found that  the minority\n\nbusiness  certification  requirements of  the  Small Business\n\nAdministration were  intended to insure  that front companies\n\ndid not usurp program benefits:\n\n            To  become  certified   for  the   [SBA\n          minority  business]  program, a  business\n          must establish  that  it is  socially  or\n          economically disadvantaged, is owned by a\n          minority person and not  a mere front for\n          a  non-[minority certified]  business, is\n          actually controlled by a minority person,\n          and  will  be   performing  at  least  15\n          percent of the government contract.\n\nId.  at  372.    The  Anderson  defendants  used a  certified\n                              \n\nminority  business  as  a  front  to  obtain  SBA  set  aside\n\n                             -22-\n\ncontracts when the  contract work was actually  subcontracted\n\nto other, non-minority, businesses.  Compare United States v.\n                                                          \n\nPorter, 591 F.2d 1948 (5th Cir. 1979) (affirming dismissal of\n      \n\nan indictment  which charged doctors and  a laboratory worker\n\nwith  a kickback scheme to defraud Medicare in violation of  \n\n371 because there was no Medicare policy or  regulation which\n\nprohibited  doctors from  taking such  payments and  Medicare\n\ncosts were not increased).\n\n        It is reasonable to  infer that the MBE certification\n\nrequirements  for  the  agencies  alleged in  this  case  are\n\nintended to prevent non-MBEs from taking advantage of MBE set\n\naside contracts.8   The MBE certification requirements impose\n\nduties upon  the defendants  and  others not  to subvert  the\n\nsystem established  to benefit minority businesses.   Because\n\nRusco did not do  the re-bar \"furnish\" work specified  in the\n\ncontracts, Rusco was  operating as a  front for Barker  which\n\n                    \n\n8  The  Information  summarized,   rather  than  citing,  the\nregulations which control  the MBE programs  of the DOT,  EPA\nand  GSA  which  provides  sufficient  understanding  of  the\nfunction  of  the  programs.    Nevertheless,  the  pertinent\nlanguage of the regulation for MBE  certification for the DOT\nis instructive:\n\n          To  ensure that  this part  benefits only\n          MBEs  which are  owned and  controlled in\n          both form  and substance  by one  or more\n          minorities or women, DOT recipients shall\n          use Schedules  A and B  . . .  to certify\n          firms who  wish to participate as MBEs in\n          DOT under this part.\n49 C.F.R.   23.51.\n\n                             -23-\n\ndid the  \"furnish\" work  and received the  contract payments.\n\nAs  the government alleges, MBE contracts can only be awarded\n\nto  MBEs  who  actually  do  the  work,  and  therefore,  the\n\ndefendants' use of  Rusco was  a fraud on  the MBE  programs.\n\nJust because the  defendants used Rusco, a  certified MBE, to\n\nsubvert the MBE requirements does not make their actions less\n\nreprehensible.\n\n        The Information also alleges that  Rusco fraudulently\n\nmaintained its MBE certification  after 1982.  The defendants\n\ncounter that the Information cannot properly charge them with\n\ndefrauding  the  government  based  upon  false documentation\n\nsubmitted by Rusco to various MBE certifying agencies because\n\nthere is  no allegation  that  the agencies  relied upon  the\n\nfalse documentation to certify  Rusco.  In  Dennis,  384 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n855, the Supreme Court found that an indictment which charged\n\nmembers  of  a  mine   workers'  union  who  submitted  false\n\naffidavits, stating  that they were not  Communists, in order\n\nto  procure  the services  of  the  National Labor  Relations\n\nBoard,     properly  stated  a  conspiracy   to  defraud  the\n\ngovernment pursuant to    371.  The defendants  objected that\n\nthe affidavits did not  defraud the Board because it  did not\n\nrely  on the  veracity of  the non-Communist  affidavits, but\n\ninstead relied  only on the fact  that they were filed.    In\n\nresponse, the Court held as follows:\n\n            The   facts   are,  according   to  the\n          indictment,  that  petitioners and  their\n\n                             -24-\n\n          co-conspirators  could not  have obtained\n          the   Board's  services   and  facilities\n          without filing  non-Communist affidavits;\n          that  the  affidavits  were submitted  as\n          part of  a scheme to induce  the Board to\n          act; that  the  Board acted  in  reliance\n          upon the fact that affidavits were filed;\n          and  that  these  affidavits were  false.\n          Within the  meaning of   371, this was  a\n          conspiracy to defraud  the United  States\n          or an agency thereof.\n\nDennis at 862.   The effect of  the conspiracy and the  false\n      \n\naffidavits was  that the  defendants' trade union  gained the\n\nbenefit of  the Board's  services and facilities  despite the\n\nfact that the  union was  not qualified because  some of  its\n\nofficers were Communists.  The Court held that the conspiracy\n\ndefrauded  the government  by  impeding the  function of  the\n\nBoard  to  implement  its   policy  to  exclude  unions  with\n\nCommunist officers.      Similarly, in this case, Rusco could\n\nnot  have  maintained its  certification  as  an MBE  without\n\nfiling  the required documentation.   Because  the defendants\n\nhad taken control of Rusco, the documentation  filed by Rusco\n\ncontained  false  and  misleading  information  and  material\n\nomissions which directly affected  Rusco's eligibility as  an\n\nMBE.   Unless  Rusco  maintained its  MBE certification,  the\n\ndefendants' scheme  to obtain  MBE set aside  contracts would\n\nhave failed.  The state and local MBE certification  agencies\n\ngranted  MBE certification  to Rusco  in response  to Rusco's\n\nfraudulent documentation.  Therefore, Rusco's filings for MBE\n\ncertification were at the  core of the defendants' conspiracy\n\n                             -25-\n\nand may be considered as a part of the fraudulent activity in\n\nfurtherance  of the  conspiracy.   Even if  Rusco had  been a\n\nproperly certified MBE, however,   \"[a] method that makes use\n\nof innocent  individuals or  businesses to reach  and defraud\n\nthe United States  is not for that reason beyond the scope of\n\n  371.\"  Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 129 (1986).  \n                                \n\n        This court has considered  the meaning of the defraud\n\nclause in    371 and its  substantially similar predecessors,\n\nand  found  actions which  defrauded the  United States  in a\n\nvariety of circumstances.

The  Supreme  Court\n\ndefined  \"defraud\" in  a  substantially  similar  predecessor\n\nstatute to   371 as follows:\n\n            To  conspire  to  defraud   the  United\n          States  means  primarily  to   cheat  the\n          government  out of property or money, but\n          it  also  means   to  interfere  with  or\n          obstruct one of  its lawful  governmental\n          functions by deceit,  craft or  trickery,\n          or at  least by means that are dishonest.\n          It  is not necessary  that the government\n          shall   be   subjected  to   property  or\n          pecuniary  loss by  the  fraud, but  only\n          that its legitimate  official action  and\n          purpose    shall     be    defeated    by\n          misrepresentation,   chicane,    or   the\n          overreaching   of   those  charged   with\n          carrying out the governmental intention.\n\nHammerschmidt  v.

The  Court  held  that\n\nalthough the  defendants' conduct was aimed  at impairing the\n\nfunction  of  the  Selective  Service,  a  lawful  government\n\nfunction, it  was open  defiance and  not a  scheme involving\n\ndeceit  or  trickery, and  therefore,  could  not be  charged\n\nwithin the meaning of defrauding the government.\n\n                             -27-\n\n        The  allegations  in  this  case  do  not  present  a\n\nsituation  where defendants conspired  to do something which,\n\nin itself, was innocent, but  which had the unintended effect\n\nof  thwarting  the MBE  programs.   Nor  were  the defendants\n\nengaging  in  open  defiance   or  protest  against  the  MBE\n\nprograms.   The  defendants'  actions,  as alleged,  involved\n\ndeceit and trickery  to benefit the defendants by hampering a\n\nlawful  government function.   A conspiracy of  this kind has\n\nlong been recognized to defraud the government.    \n\n        The  Information alleges  that  \"[p]ursuant  to  this\n\nunlawful  conspiracy in excess  of $5 million  in federal and\n\nfederally  assisted  construction  contracts were  improperly\n\ncredited towards the MBE goals of the various departments and\n\nagencies  of  the United  States.\"9    Information at     14.\n\nWhile this allegation could be more forcefully stated, taking\n\nthe   Information  as   a  whole   and  with   all  necessary\n\nimplications, the meaning is clear:  the defendants conspired\n\nwith others to defraud the DOT, EPA and GSA, agencies of  the\n\nUnited States, in the implementation of their MBE programs by\n\nusing  Rusco  to  win  MBE  set  aside  contracts  which  the\n\ndefendants would not otherwise have been eligible to receive.\n\n                    \n\n9 The defendants  do not  challenge the validity  of the  MBE\nprogram. It is  uncontroverted, in  this case,  that the  MBE\nprogram  is  a  lawful  function  of  government.    And  see\n                                                             \nFullilove  v.

Taken as  a\n\nwhole,  the  Information   sufficiently  alleges   fraudulent\n\nconduct  by  the  defendants  and  their  co-conspirators  to\n\nimpair, defeat, or obstruct the  function of the MBE programs\n\ninvolved in this  case.

The procurement manager for Seminole conspired with\n\nhis friend  to get  contracts for  the project  with kickback\n\npayments to the manager.   \n\n        The defendants argued on  appeal that the evidence at\n\ntrial showed that the target  of the conspiracy was  Seminole\n\nand  not the  federal government.   The  government responded\n\nthat,  because  Seminole's   construction  project   received\n\nfederal  financial assistance and some federal supervision, a\n\nconspiracy to defraud  Seminole was the same  as a conspiracy\n\nto  defraud   the  government.     The  Court   rejected  the\n\ngovernment's explanation and held:\n\n          The  conspiracies  criminalized by    371\n          are defined not only by the nature of the\n          injury  intended  by the  conspiracy, and\n          the   method   used  to   effectuate  the\n          conspiracy,     but     also and     most\n          importantly by   the    target   of   the\n                                        \n          conspiracy.\n\nTanner  at  130.      The  Court  also  held,  however,  that\n      \n\nconspiracies  to  defraud  the   federal  government  may  be\n\naccomplished through intermediaries, innocent  third parties,\n\nand the  Court remanded  the  case to  determine whether  the\n\ndefendants    conspired   to    cause   Seminole    to   make\n\nmisrepresentations to the REA.  Tanner at 132.  \n                                      \n\n                             -30-\n\n        In  this case,  the government  alleged that  the MBE\n\nprograms  of the involved federal agencies were the target of\n\nthe defendants' conspiracy to defraud.   Information at   12.\n\nThe  Information supports the general allegation in statutory\n\nlanguage  with detail of the workings of the MBE programs and\n\nthe actions by the defendants which harmed the  MBE programs.\n\nThe Information  alleges that  the defendants'  scheme caused\n\n\"in  excess of $5  million in federal  and federally assisted\n\nconstruction  contracts [to  be] improperly  credited towards\n\nthe  MBE goals of the various departments and agencies of the\n\nUnited  States.\"  Because the purpose of the MBE programs, as\n\nalleged,  is to insure that  at least ten  percent of federal\n\nand  federally assisted  construction  project  contracts  be\n\nawarded to  MBE companies,  the defendants' scheme  to divert\n\nMBE contracts through Rusco to  benefit themselves obstructed\n\nthe proper  function of  the MBE  programs.  The  Information\n\ntaken  as  a whole  clearly alleges  that  the target  of the\n\ndefendants' conspiracy was  $5 million worth of MBE set aside\n\ncontracts  which  should  have   been  awarded  to   minority\n\nbusinesses. \n\n        The  Information  does  not allege  that  either  the\n\ngeneral contractors or  the state  agencies implementing  MBE\n\ncertification were  operating  as federal  agencies based  on\n\ntheir  receipt of federal and federally  assisted funds.  The\n\nmisrepresentations and fraud  to general contractors  and MBE\n\n                             -31-\n\ncertifying  agencies  by the  defendants  and co-conspirators\n\nwere  the means to the  end, using innocent  third parties to\n\neffect their scheme.   The Information sufficiently alleges a\n\nconspiracy   which  targeted  a  federal  function,  the  MBE\n\nprograms of  the DOT,  EPA and  GSA, and  therefore, properly\n\ncharges a conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\n E.  Sufficiency of Allegations of Harm to the United States\n                                                            \n\n        The  defendants argue that  the Information  fails to\n\nallege  a crime under    371 because it  does not allege that\n\nthe defendants  defrauded the federal government  of money or\n\nproperty.   There is no  basis for the  defendants' argument.\n\nThe language of the statute itself is broad:  \"If two or more\n\npersons conspire .  . . to defraud the United  States, or any\n\nagency thereof  in any manner  or for any  purpose. . .\"   18\n                                                  \n\nU.S.C.    371 (emphasis  added).    At  least  since Haas  v.\n                                                         \n\nHenkel, 216 U.S. 462 (1910), the Supreme Court has recognized\n      \n\nthat   371 (and  its substantially similar predecessors) were\n\nnot limited  to conspiracies which defraud  the government of\n\nmoney  or property: \"The statute is broad enough in its terms\n\nto  include  any conspiracy  for  the  purpose of  impairing,\n\nobstructing  or  defeating   the  lawful   function  of   any\n\ndepartment of Government.\"  Id. at 479.   \n                               \n\n        Although the  Supreme Court has limited  the scope of\n\nmail fraud, 18 U.S.C.    1341, to the protection  of property\n\n                             -32-\n\nrights,  that  limitation is  restricted  to  the mail  fraud\n\nstatute.

The  history  of  interpretation  of     371\n\ndemonstrates  that the statute  proscribes conspiracies, such\n\nas  the defendants' conspiracy, which target federal programs\n\nand which intend to  deceitfully secure the benefit  of those\n\nprograms.   In other words, the defendants had a duty imposed\n\npursuant  to    371  not to  divert  the benefit  of  the MBE\n\nprograms   from  their  intended  recipients,  qualified  and\n\ncertified  minority businesses, to  themselves.   The statute\n\nitself  provides fair  warning  that the  defendants' alleged\n\nconspiracy  may   be  charged   as  criminal  under      371.\n\n                             -33-\n\nTherefore, we reverse  the decision  of the  lower court  and\n\nremand for trial.\n\n                             -34-\n",

Therefore, we   examine the\n\nInformation as  a whole to determine  whether it sufficiently\n\ncharges the offense proscribed by the conspiracy statute.\n\n                             II.\n\n                       The Information\n                                      \n\n        To  begin, we  summarize the  key allegations  of the\n\nInformation.    The government's  allegations  concerning the\n\ndefendants' conspiracy to defraud  the United States focus on\n\nthe  MBE  programs  of  several federal  agencies,  the  U.S.\n\nDepartment   of  Transportation  (DOT),    the  Environmental\n\nProtection   Agency   (EPA),   and   the   General   Services\n\nAdministration (GSA).    These federal  agencies intended the\n\nMBE   programs   to     \"support[]   the   fullest   possible\n\nparticipation of firms owned and controlled by certain racial\n\nminorities and women in  the construction programs funded and\n\nassisted by these departments  and agencies.\"  Information at\n\n  6.   To that end, the MBE programs required that recipients\n\nof funds from federal agencies establish goals or set aside a\n\npercentage  of  federal  funds   received  for  contracts  to\n\ncertified MBE businesses.  Information at   7.  \n\n                             -4-\n\n        Federal agencies with  MBE programs  rely upon  state\n\nand local  governments  to certify  applicants  as  qualified\n\nminority businesses.  Information at   9.  To qualify for MBE\n\ncertification, at least fifty-one percent of the ownership of\n\nthe enterprise  must be by  certain minority groups,  and the\n\nminority owners must also control the daily operations of the\n\nbusiness.   Information at   6. To implement the MBE program,\n\nthe  entity  receiving federal  agency funding  hires general\n\ncontractors  to   perform  the   work,  who  in   turn  award\n\nsubcontracts to  certified MBEs  to meet the  percentage goal\n\nfor the project.   For  subcontract work to  qualify for  MBE\n\ngoals or  set aside  contracts, the  MBE certified  firm must\n\nperform a  \"commercially useful function in  the execution of\n\nthe project by actually  performing, managing and supervising\n\nthe work involved.\"  Information at   10.  For  materials and\n\nsupplies  to qualify,  the  MBE certified  firm must  \"either\n\nproduce the  goods from raw materials  or substantially alter\n\nthe goods before reselling them.\"  Information at   10.\n\n        The  Information alleges  that  from  about  October,\n\n1982,  until  at  least  July,  1986,  Barker  Steel  Company\n\n(Barker)   and   its   president,   director   and   majority\n\nstockholder, Robert B.  Brack (Brack), conspired with  others\n\nto use Rusco Steel Company (Rusco) as a front  company to win\n\nMBE set aside  contracts for  Barker.  Information  at    13.\n\nBarker   was  a  Massachusetts  corporation  which  furnished\n\n                             -5-\n\nfabricated  steel  reinforcing   bars  (re-bars)  and   other\n\nproducts to the construction industry throughout New England.\n\nBarker was never  a certified MBE.  Information at     1, 11.\n\nRusco,  located in Rhode Island, had been certified as an MBE\n\nin  several  states before  the  scheme  with the  defendants\n\nbegan.  Information at    3, 15.\n\n        The  steel  re-bar  industry  includes  two  distinct\n\nfunctions:  fabricators and erectors.  Firms which operate as\n\nfabricators   \"cut  and   bend  the   re-bars  to   meet  the\n\nspecifications of a particular construction project and  then\n\ndeliver the  re-bars to the construction  site.\"  Information\n\nat   5.   The industry term for the  work done by fabricators\n\nis \"furnish\" work.  Id.

Id. \n                                      \n\n        In  October,  1982,  Barker  agreed  with  Rusco that\n\nBarker  would finance  a new  division of Rusco  for erecting\n\nsteel re-bar, \"erection\" work.   Information at    5, 16.  In\n\nexchange,  Rusco  would  allow  Barker to  market  its  steel\n\nproducts through Rusco for re-bar \"furnish\" contracts to take\n\nadvantage of  Rusco's MBE  certification.  Information  at   \n\n13,  16.  Prior  to 1982, Rusco  had operated as  a broker of\n\nsteel re-bar but had not fabricated re-bar or erected re-bar.\n\nInformation at    15.   Beginning  in 1982, Barker  employees\n\n                             -6-\n\nmanaged all aspects of the fabrication, sales and shipping of\n\nsteel  re-bar and  other  products in  its  own name  and  in\n\nRusco's  name  when  contracts  required  MBE  certification.\n\nInformation at     16, 19,  20.  Barker  employees and  Brack\n\nexercised  substantial  control  over  Rusco  throughout this\n\nperiod.  Information at     22, 25.  In 1985,  the defendants\n\nmerged a subsidiary  company into Rusco, to deceive state MBE\n\ncertifying   agencies  about  Rusco's   eligibility  for  MBE\n\ncertification.  Information at    25, 43.\n\n        As part of the scheme, Rusco submitted  documentation\n\nto  various  state and  local  agencies  for  the purpose  of\n\nobtaining   or   maintaining   certification   as   an   MBE.\n\nInformation at    32, 26, 41, 47.  The documents submitted by\n\nRusco  contained false, misleading  and fraudulent statements\n\nas well as material omissions. Id.  The Information concludes\n                                  \n\nthat as a result of the  conspiracy, more than $5 million  in\n\nfederally   funded   and   federally  assisted   construction\n\ncontracts were improperly credited  toward MBE goals when the\n\ncontracts actually  benefitted Barker,  which was not  an MBE\n\nfirm.  Information at   15.  The conspiracy, according to the\n\nInformation, impeded,  impaired, obstructed and  defeated the\n\nimplementation,  execution  and  administration  of  the  MBE\n\nprograms of DOT, EPA and GSA.  Information at   12.\n\n                             III.\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n                             -7-\n\n        The district court  dismissed the Information on  the\n\ngrounds  that:   (1) it failed  to allege a  violation by the\n\ndefendants  of any  MBE  program statute;    (2) it  did  not\n\nclearly state a violation by the defendants of a duty owed to\n\nthe federal  government, and (3)  it failed to  allege direct\n\ncontact with  federal agencies.  The  defendants contend that\n\nbecause the MBE program does not impose criminal penalties or\n\nany obligations upon them, they  were not fairly warned  that\n\nthe  conduct alleged  in the  Information could give  rise to\n\ncriminal charges.  In further support of the dismissal of the\n\nInformation,  the defendants  add that their  alleged conduct\n\nwas  not  fraud  because  it  did  not  deprive  the  federal\n\ngovernment of any money or property.  The government counters\n\nthat the  Information properly and sufficiently  alleged that\n\nthe defendants conspired to defraud the federal government in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   371.\n\n           A.

The pertinent  language of   371  provides as\n\nfollows:\n\n            If two or  more persons conspire either\n          to commit any offense against  the United\n          States,  or to defraud the United States,\n          or any  agency thereof in  any manner  or\n          for any purpose, and  one or more of such\n          persons do any  act to effect  the object\n          of the conspiracy each shall be fined not\n\n                             -8-\n\n          more  than $10,000 or imprisoned not more\n          than five years, or both.\n\n18  U.S.C.    371.   To sufficiently  charge a  conspiracy to\n\ndefraud,  the Information  must  allege  the three  essential\n\nelements  of  section  371:    \"an  agreement,  the  unlawful\n\nobjective of the agreement,  and an overt act  in furtherance\n\nof the  agreement.\"  United  States v.

Although Rusco may\n\nhave  been a properly certified  MBE at one  time, during the\n\nrelevant period of the  defendants' scheme, they financed and\n\ncontrolled Rusco,  thereby destroying  its eligibility as  an\n\nMBE.

The\n\nessence of the government's charges was \"that the appellant's\n\nfailure  to inform the Bank of the 'structured' nature of his\n\ntransfers constituted an illegal scheme to avoid detection of\n\nthese payments by causing     the Bank to fail in its duty to\n\nreport them.\"  Id. at 679.

On  appeal, the  court\n\nreversed  the  convictions   and  dismissed  the  indictments\n\nfinding  that  the government  had  not  properly charged  or\n\nproved a conspiracy to defraud the government under  371.  In\n\nsummary, the  government alleged that  the doctor  defendants\n\nhad  sent lab  work  to the  laboratory operator  defendant's\n\n                             -16-\n\nmanual laboratories because they received a payment for doing\n\nso, rather  than to  automated laboratories which  might have\n\nprocessed the work  more quickly and more  cheaply.  Although\n\nthe  facts relating  to the  practice which  provided payment\n\nback to the doctors are  complex, the effect was obvious--the\n\ndoctors  sent  their  lab  work  to  the  laboratories  which\n\nprovided the payments and  not to the automated laboratories.\n\nThe charges to Medicare, however,  were not increased by  the\n\npractice and were within  the guidelines for lab work  in the\n\narea, and the quality of the work was not an issue.  Further,\n\nthe  defendants   did  not   violate   any  Medicare   rules,\n\nregulations   or   other   requirements   by   using   manual\n\nlaboratories.   The  government  charged  that the  practice,\n\nnevertheless,  violated     371   because  it  defrauded  the\n\ngovernment's \"right to  have the  Medicare program  conducted\n\nhonestly  and  fairly.\"   Id.  at  1056.

The defendants  objected that\n\nthe affidavits did not  defraud the Board because it  did not\n\nrely  on the  veracity of  the non-Communist  affidavits, but\n\ninstead relied  only on the fact  that they were filed.    In\n\nresponse, the Court held as follows:\n\n            The   facts   are,  according   to  the\n          indictment,  that  petitioners and  their\n\n                             -24-\n\n          co-conspirators  could not  have obtained\n          the   Board's  services   and  facilities\n          without filing  non-Communist affidavits;\n          that  the  affidavits  were submitted  as\n          part of  a scheme to induce  the Board to\n          act; that  the  Board acted  in  reliance\n          upon the fact that affidavits were filed;\n          and  that  these  affidavits were  false.\n          Within the  meaning of   371, this was  a\n          conspiracy to defraud  the United  States\n          or an agency thereof.\n\nDennis at 862.   The effect of  the conspiracy and the  false\n      \n\naffidavits was  that the  defendants' trade union  gained the\n\nbenefit of  the Board's  services and facilities  despite the\n\nfact that the  union was  not qualified because  some of  its\n\nofficers were Communists.  The Court held that the conspiracy\n\ndefrauded  the government  by  impeding the  function of  the\n\nBoard  to  implement  its   policy  to  exclude  unions  with\n\nCommunist officers.      Similarly, in this case, Rusco could\n\nnot  have  maintained its  certification  as  an MBE  without\n\nfiling  the required documentation.   Because  the defendants\n\nhad taken control of Rusco, the documentation  filed by Rusco\n\ncontained  false  and  misleading  information  and  material\n\nomissions which directly affected  Rusco's eligibility as  an\n\nMBE.   Unless  Rusco  maintained its  MBE certification,  the\n\ndefendants' scheme  to obtain  MBE set aside  contracts would\n\nhave failed.  The state and local MBE certification  agencies\n\ngranted  MBE certification  to Rusco  in response  to Rusco's\n\nfraudulent documentation.  Therefore, Rusco's filings for MBE\n\ncertification were at the  core of the defendants' conspiracy\n\n                             -25-\n\nand may be considered as a part of the fraudulent activity in\n\nfurtherance  of the  conspiracy.

The  history  of  interpretation  of     371\n\ndemonstrates  that the statute  proscribes conspiracies, such\n\nas  the defendants' conspiracy, which target federal programs\n\nand which intend to  deceitfully secure the benefit  of those\n\nprograms.   In other words, the defendants had a duty imposed\n\npursuant  to    371  not to  divert  the benefit  of  the MBE\n\nprograms   from  their  intended  recipients,  qualified  and\n\ncertified  minority businesses, to  themselves.   The statute\n\nitself  provides fair  warning  that the  defendants' alleged\n\nconspiracy  may   be  charged   as  criminal  under      371.\n\n                             -33-\n\nTherefore, we reverse  the decision  of the  lower court  and\n\nremand for trial.\n\n                             -34-\n</pre>",
