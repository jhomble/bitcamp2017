P. 11  for filing a groundless complaint against defendants-\n\nappellees.   After careful  review, we affirm  the district court\n\nsanction order in all respects.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          In the fall of 1985, the City of East Providence, Rhode\n\nIsland,  announced that  an  independent  testing  service  would\n\nadminister a competitive examination for the position of Chief of\n\nPolice.   A city ordinance empowered the City Manager, defendant-\n\nappellee  Peter Witschen, to fill the position from among the top\n\nthree performers on the examination.  See Civil Service Ordinance\n                                         \n\nof  East Providence, R.I.    11-66(c),(d).  It was no secret that\n\nsome  members of the City Council, including defendants-appellees\n\nin  this action,  favored  the appointment  of defendant  Anthony\n\nDeCastro.   DeCastro achieved the highest  examination score and,\n\nin January 1986, was appointed by the City Manager.\n\n          Following the appointment,  a rift arose between  Chief\n\nDeCastro and the  Fraternal Order of Police Union (Union).   At a\n\npublic  session of the City Council years later, it was disclosed\n\nthat  several defendants  had discussed beforehand  with DeCastro\n\nthe likelihood  that a competitive examination  would be adminis-\n\ntered and that DeCastro's test-taking skills were weak.  Finally,\n\nit was also disclosed  at the City Council meeting  that DeCastro\n\n                                2\n\nhad attended  a preparatory course in  \"executive development\" on\n\nhis own  time, for  which he  was reimbursed  pursuant to a  City\n\npolicy permitting reimbursement for \"in-service training.\"\n\n          Present at the City Council meeting were several of the\n\nplaintiffs,  all disappointed  applicants  for the  position, and\n\nappellant Linder, counsel to  the Union.  Shortly after  the City\n\nCouncil meeting, two of  the plaintiffs met  briefly  with Linder\n\nand discussed  factual grounds  for a possible  lawsuit in  their\n\nbehalf.   Thereafter, Linder  conducted limited  discussions with\n\nother plaintiffs along similar lines.\n\n          On January 3, 1990, Linder initiated the present action\n\nunder  42 U.S.C.   1983 in  the United States  District Court for\n\nthe District of Rhode Island, charging deprivations of plaintiff-\n\ns' due process right to a fair and impartial promotional examina-\n\ntion as provided by  the City ordinance, and of  an alleged right\n\nof  \"equal protection\" to compete for the position.  Although the\n\ncomplaint pleaded relevant circumstances which the district court\n\nlater  characterized as    \"suspicious,\" see  supra  pp. 2-3,  it\n                                                   \n\nneither alleged     nor asserted facts  sufficient to support  an\n\ninference     that the examination  was either \"rigged\"  to favor\n\nDeCastro or administered or graded unfairly.\n\n          Prior  to  filing the  complaint,  Linder  made a  copy\n\navailable to the City  Solicitor, who advised Linder that  it was\n\n\"unjustified,\" and  warned that  the City  was  likely to  demand\n\nattorney fees for defending against it.  Linder was not deterred.\n\n          Ultimately, the district court entered summary judgment\n\n                                3\n\nfor  all defendants  on the  ground that  \"the complaint  made no\n\nallegations of 'exam  rigging,'\" which was the  essence of plain-\n\ntiffs' claim.  Silva v. Witschen,  745 F. Supp. 798, 803 (D. R.I.\n                                \n\n1990).1    The  defendants  thereafter  requested attorney  fees,\n\neither under 42 U.S.C.   1988 or as a sanction under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 11.\n\n          In due  course, the district court  conducted a lengthy\n\nhearing to determine whether the fee request should be allowed on\n                            \n\neither ground.   The amount of  any fee award was  not before the\n\ncourt  at the hearing.   Following the hearing,  the court denied\n\nthe request for an  award under section 1988, on the  ground that\n\nthe plaintiffs  had not  acted in bad  faith.   The court  found,\n\nhowever,  that Linder was subject  to sanction under  Rule 11 for\n\nfiling a  groundless complaint.   The defendants  later requested\n\nfees and costs totalling almost $250,000, which the court reduced\n\nto $75,349.96,  approximately two-thirds of which  was attributed\n\nto  the merits phase and one-third  to the sanctions phase of the\n\ndistrict court litigation.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          All  aspects  of the  Rule  11  sanctions decision  are\n\nreviewed  for abuse  of discretion.

Eastern\n                                                                 \n\nMass.

As the  party  challenging the  sanctions award,  Linder\n\nbears the formidable burden  of establishing abuse of discretion.\n\nSee  Navarro-Ayala v.

Section 2074(a)  of  Title 28  states  that \"the\nSupreme Court shall not require the application of such [amended]\nrule to further proceedings  then pending to the extent  that, in\n                                                                 \nthe opinion of the  court in which such proceedings  are pending,\n                                                                \nthe application of  such rule  in such proceedings  would not  be\nfeasible  or would work injustice, in which event the former rule\napplies.\"  28 U.S.C.   2074(a)  (emphasis added).\n\n                                7\n\n(declining to  apply 1993  amended rule where  sanctioned conduct\n\noccurred prior  to Dec. 1,  1993 and pre-amendment  standards had\n\nbeen  applied at sanctions hearing).4   This is particularly true\n\nsince  Linder's sanctionable conduct  was solely  responsible for\n\nthe satellite proceedings relating to  Rule 11 sanctions.   More-\n\nover,  it would  be  impracticable, not  only  to undo  the  harm\n\nactually occasioned defendants, but  to review the district court\n\norder  under the  altered standards  established by  amended Rule\n\n                    \n\n     4Linder argues that he would not  have been sanctioned under\nthe  amended rule, because he would  have withdrawn the complaint\nas allowed under the 21-day \"safe harbor\" provision.  See Fed. R.\n                                                         \nCiv.  P. 11(c)(1)(A) (Dec. 1, 1993); supra note 2.  Linder cannot\n                                          \nhave it both ways, however.  His argument is based on the assump-\ntion  that he  would  have availed  himself  of a  \"safe  harbor\"\nprovision had  he received notice of  the particular deficiencies\n                                                    \nin  the  complaint.   This  retrospective  appraisal ignores  the\nreality that Linder flatly disregarded a substantially equivalent\nwarning from the  City Solicitor  before the  complaint was  ever\nfiled.  See supra p. 3-4.  Thus, Linder's argument cannot prevail\n                 \nunless appellees  failed to point out  particular deficiencies in\nthe complaint.   However, appellees' statement  of relevant facts\non appeal represents,  and Linder  does not deny,  that the  City\nSolicitor \"informed [Linder] of the pleading deficiencies, and of\n                                                         \nthe  City's probable  attempt  to collect  sanctions, before  the\npleading  was even  filed.\"   (Appellees'  Br.  at 16)  (emphasis\nadded).   Since  Linder neither denies  appellees' representation\nnor included the relevant  portions of the hearing  transcript to\nwhich  appellees' statement of facts  cites, see Fed.  R. App. P.\n                                                \n10(b), 11(a) (appellant bears  burden of including material items\nin appellate  record), we  will not  indulge an assumption  fore-\nclosed by the record before us.  It would be unjust to permit yet\na second \"safe harbor\" refuge for Linder to escape responsibility\n        \nfor the expense occasioned an innocent party which forewarned him\nthat  the complaint  was unjustified.   Furthermore, even  if the\ncost and expense occasioned by Linder's sanctionable conduct were\nto be disregarded, it  would be unjust to permit  these satellite\nproceedings  to be further extended by  remanding to the district\ncourt to afford Linder the opportunity to \"withdraw\" a groundless\ncomplaint previously dismissed on the merits.\n\n                                8\n\n11.5   See Hashemi, 784  F.2d at 1583-84  (rejecting claim, under\n                  \n\nvirtually identical 1983 promulgation order, that amended Rule 11\n\nstandards should apply \"because the case was pending on appeal by\n\nthe plaintiff  at  the  time the  Rule  became  effective\");  cf.\n                                                                 \n\nFreund, 956 F.2d  at 363  (refusing to apply  amended rule  which\n      \n\nwould work  \"manifest injustice\").

Appropriateness of Rule 11 Sanctions\n                                         \n\n          Prior to December 1,  1993, Rule 11 mandated  sanctions\n\nfor  interposing a filing either for an improper purpose or under\n                                                           \n\n                    \n\n     5For example,  deterrence was the primary  purpose served by\nRule 11 sanctions prior to December 1, 1983.  See  Cooter &amp; Gell,\n                                                                \n496 U.S. at 393.  Yet \"courts . . . ha[d] noted that compensatory\nand punitive purposes also [we]re  served by sanctions [under old\nRule  11].\"  Charles A. Wright &amp;  Arthur Miller, 5A Federal Prac-\n                                                                 \ntice and  Procedure   1336 at 100-101 (1990);  Anderson, 900 F.2d\n                                                       \nat 394-95.  Under amended Rule 11, however, \"the purpose of . . .\nsanctions is to deter rather than to compensate . . . .\"  Fed. R.\n                            \nCiv.

Thus,\nunder amended Rule  11, \"if  a monetary sanction  is imposed,  it\nshould ordinarily be paid  into court as a penalty,\"  id., though\n                                                         \nthe court may  award monetary  sanctions to a  party in  \"unusual\ncircumstances,\" id.

Ct.  2510, 2516-17 (1993) (general rule of\n\nretroactivity in  civil  cases), Linder  contends that  sanctions\n\nwere improperly imposed.  This argument is a red herring.\n\n          The  district court order neither mentioned nor applied\n\na  heightened  pleading standard,  nor did  it  cite to  any case\n\ninvolving  a heightened pleading requirement.   See Silva, 745 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp.  at 801.

Ct. at\n1162-63.\n\n                                10\n\nlegal basis whatever  for Linder's reliance  on a federally  pro-\n\ntected property  interest, in  principal part  because plaintiffs\n\nmade no allegation of \"exam-rigging.\"  See Burns v.

Ill. 1980) (complaint alleging exam-rigging\n\nstates   1983 claim in  circumstances where unwavering custom and\n\npolicy is  to promote  applicant achieving highest  score).   The\n\ncourt  concluded that  the  only protected  property interest  at\n\nissue was plaintiffs' due process right to compete fairly for the\n\nposition  of  Chief of  Police,8 and  since  they had  alleged no\n\nfacts evidencing such a deprivation the action was  groundless as\n\na matter of law.  Silva, 745 F. Supp. at 805.  Neither before the\n                       \n\ndistrict court, nor on appeal, has Linder raised  doubt as to the\n\nsoundness of  the district court ruling that the complaint failed\n\nto state a cause of action.\n\n                    \n\n     7As the district court observed:\n\n     Like the  City Manager in Burns,  City Manager Witschen\n                                    \n     had discretion to make  an appointment \"after interview\n     and investigation,\" from among  \"the names of the three\n     persons  standing highest  on  the  appropriate  list.\"\n     Since the City Manager could appoint any one of the top\n     three  certified candidates,  none of  these candidates\n     had a clearly defined property interest in promotion to\n     Chief of Police.\n\nSilva, 745 F.

Improper Purpose\n                          \n\n          The district court further  found that Linder attempted\n\n   by bringing the present action    to intimidate \"the City into\n\nterminating DeCastro . . . . [thus] using this case to further an\n\nimproper objective.\"  Silva v. Witschen, C.A.  No. 90-0005L, slip\n                                       \n\nop. at 18-19 (D.  R.I. Nov. 5, 1992) (order imposing  sanctions).\n\nAlthough Linder admits to a \"dual motive,\" he argues that Rule 11\n\nsanctions  may not  be imposed  for commencing  an action  for an\n\n\"improper purpose\" if  there was  also a proper  motive, in  this\n\ncase vindicating  plaintiffs' rights.   The district  court found\n\nthat    \n\n          Linder,  who was  also  the attorney  for the\n          Union, was  wearing two hats here.   Although\n          he purported to  represent the plaintiffs  in\n          this case, all his actions were calculated to\n                                                       \n          achieve the goal of  the Union, the ouster of\n                                        \n          DeCastro.  While plaintiffs honestly believed\n          in their  cause of  action, Linder  was using\n          their lawsuit  as a bargaining  chip to pres-\n          sure the City on behalf of  the Union to ter-\n          minate DeCastro as Chief of Police.\n\nId. at 19 (emphasis added).\n   \n\n          Linder's contention that his  conduct is not sanctiona-\n\nble because  he intended to  protect plaintiffs' legal  rights is\n\nyet  another red herring.  We are  aware of no authority or other\n\nbasis  for the  view  that an  attorney  who files  a  groundless\n\ncomplaint, for an improper  purpose and without reasonable inqui-\n\nry, see  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, is exonerated from sanctions because\n       \n\nhe was  simply asserting  groundless nonexistent legal  claims in\n\nbehalf of his  clients.  Cf.  Lieb v. Topstone Indus.,  Inc., 788\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 151, 157 (3d Cir. 1986) (\"[P]leader may not escape liability\n\n                                12\n\nbecause  he did  not intend  to bring  about additional  delay or\n\nexpense.   If  reasonable  preparatory steps  would have  avoided\n\nthose consequences,  sanctions are appropriate.\").   Accordingly,\n\nwe uphold the district court finding of improper motive.  Cf.

See  also Fed.  R. Civ.

He argues that there  was no reason to conduct a Rule\n\n11 hearing once the court found no legal basis for the complaint,\n\nsee  Silva, 745 F. Supp.  at 803, since  sanctions were mandatory\n          \n\nunder  the pre-amendment version of Rule 11, Jensen v.

The grant of summary judgment against plaintiffs did not\n\npreordain the imposition  of any Rule 11 sanction against Linder.\n\n                                13\n\nRather, the hearing was necessary to determine whether Linder had\n                                                      \n\nviolated  Rule 11 and, if  so, to determine  an appropriate sanc-\n        \n\ntion.   Additionally,  defendants requested  a fee  award against\n\nplaintiffs under 42 U.S.C.   1988 as well, which the court consi-\n\ndered at the same hearing  and later denied.  The claim  that the\n\ndistrict court abused its  discretion by conducting a hearing  to\n\nresolve defendants' fee requests  under Rule 11 and  section 1988\n\nis frivolous.\n\n          Linder  has fallen far short  of a showing  of abuse of\n\ndiscretion.9   Rule  11  contemplates \"giv[ing]  effect to  [its]\n\ncentral  goal of  deterrence,\" Cooter  &amp; Gell,  496 U.S.  at 405,\n                                             \n\nwhile  avoiding  unnecessary  satellite  litigation;  the  proper\n\nbalance is left to the reasoned discretion of the district court,\n\nid.   Cf. Fashion House, 892  F.2d at 1082 (district  court is in\n                       \n\nbest position  to determine appropriate remedy).

Reasonableness of Sanctions\n                                     \n\n          Linder's remaining claim is that the attorney fee award\n\nis  excessive.

The appellate  record provided by\nLinder, see supra note 9, does not indicate which issue was first\n                 \ndecided, why the hearing  proceeded to the second issue,  or even\nwhether  Linder preserved  this claim by  asserting it  in timely\nfashion  below.  Moreover, the further inquiries as to the appro-\npriateness and  severity of Rule 11  sanctions were significantly\ninformed  by  the  court's determination  that  not  one but  two\ngrounds existed  for sanctioning  Linder.  See  Unanue-Casal, 898\n                                                            \nF.2d  at 841-42 (Rule  11 sanctions against  counsel warranted by\nboth prongs of rule).\n\n                                15\n\nreasonable in amount.11   Navarro-Ayala, 968  F.2d at 1427  (cit-\n                                       \n\ning cases).\n\n          a.   Merits Phase\n                           \n\n          The  district court  awarded the  City12 $53,528.81  in\n\nattorney fees and costs  incurred during the merits phase  of the\n\nlitigation  by  all  defendants,  representing  approximately 487\n\nhours devoted to legal services by counsel appearing for the five\n\nindividual defendants, and by the City Solicitor in behalf of the\n\nCity  and the same  five individual defendants  in their official\n\ncapacities.   Linder does not challenge the individual fee appli-\n\ncations, but asserts that the aggregate hours were not reasonably\n\nrequired  because  defendants did  not  take  proper measures  to\n\nmitigate  fees by  delegating jointly-required  in-court services\n\nand  submitting unitary filings  to avoid unnecessary duplication\n\nof services.

We agree that it was\n                  \n\nreasonable for  the five defendants, in  their individual capaci-\n                                                                 \n\nties, to  obtain representation  by their  own counsel  while the\n    \n\nmerits  of  plaintiffs'  claims  remained  in  litigation,  since\n\ncounsel  to the  City  represented the  individual defendants  in\n\ntheir official  capacities only.   Linder points to  no authority\n                          \n\nfor  the implicit  assumption that reasonable  mitigation efforts\n\nrequire that  the  private interests  of  parties sued  in  their\n\nindividual capacities  must go  unrepresented.  Cf.  Mariani, 983\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at 8  n.5.

Thus,  Linder failed  to  demonstrate an  abuse  of\ndiscretion.

The court also  disallowed all fees  for\n\nlegal services,  except those  services directly rendered  to the\n\nCity,  after the  point  in time  when  it became  clear  that no\n\nconflicts of interest precluded the individual defendants'  joint\n\nrepresentation  by counsel to the City.   See Brandt, 960 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n649  (no failure  to mitigate  where sanctioned  attorney's broad\n\ncomplaint necessitated  investment of extensive attorney  time in\n\ndefense  and district  court carefully  monitored procedure).

Our review of the record  discloses no basis for supposing\n\nthat  the district  court  abused its  discretion  by allowing  a\n\n$53,528.81 reimbursement to the  City for legal services rendered\n\nduring the merits  phase.   See Navarro-Ayala, 968  F.2d at  1426\n                                             \n\n(\"When the  district court settles  upon a monetary  sanction and\n\nfixes a dollar amount, a reviewing  tribunal should defer, within\n\nbroad  limits, to the  district court's exercise  of its informed\n\ndiscretion.  Nevertheless,  the court of appeals  must be careful\n\nnot  merely  to  'rubber-stamp  the  decisions  of  the  district\n\ncourt.'\") (citation omitted).\n\n          b.   Sanctions Phase\n                              \n\n          The  district court  disallowed  all fees  requested in\n\nrelation to  the sanctions  phase  of the  litigation except  for\n\n                                18\n\nthose incurred by the  City.14  The  court found that counsel  to\n\nthe individual defendants  had been notified in  advance that the\n\nCity no  longer believed there  existed any conflict  of interest\n\nprecluding   joint representation.   Thus, the court allowed only\n\n$21,821.15 in total fees and costs for 188 out of over 1500 hours\n\nexpended  by  all  counsel  representing  defendants  during  the\n\nsanctions phase.  Linder does not challenge the reasonableness of\n\nthe fees incurred by the City in the sanctions phase.15\n\n          We therefore affirm the district court judgement.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     14The  district court  adjusted for  the additional  hearing\ntime required on  the section  1988 motion by  allowing fees  for\nonly 50% of the total time expended by defendants' counsel at the\nsanctions hearing, a finding not challenged on appeal.\n\n     15Linder  argues, however,  apparently for  the  first time,\nthat  the district court abused its discretion by failing to take\ninto account his financial  ability to respond to the  fee award.\nEven assuming this claim has  been preserved, Linder presented no\nevidence concerning  his financial condition, nor  has he alleged\nfinancial  inability to satisfy the sanction.  Thus, there was no\nabuse  of discretion.  See  White v. General  Motors Corp., Inc.,\n                                                                \n908 F.2d 675, 685 (10th Cir. 1990) (\"[i]nability to pay what  the\ncourt would otherwise regard as an appropriate sanction should be\ntreated  as reasonably akin  to an affirmative  defense, with the\nburden  upon the  parties being sanctioned  to come  forward with\nevidence of their financial status\"), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1069\n                                                  \n(1991).\n     We likewise reject Linder's claim that attorney fees reason-\nably incurred in  the sanctions phase may not be made the subject\nof  a  Rule 11  sanction.   See Brandt,  960  F.2d at  651 (costs\n                                      \nincurred in litigating  request for Rule 11 sanctions in district\ncourt  recoverable as part of Rule 11 sanction); Robinson v.

A city ordinance empowered the City Manager, defendant-\n\nappellee  Peter Witschen, to fill the position from among the top\n\nthree performers on the examination.  See Civil Service Ordinance\n                                         \n\nof  East Providence, R.I.    11-66(c),(d).  It was no secret that\n\nsome  members of the City Council, including defendants-appellees\n\nin  this action,  favored  the appointment  of defendant  Anthony\n\nDeCastro.   DeCastro achieved the highest  examination score and,\n\nin January 1986, was appointed by the City Manager.\n\n          Following the appointment,  a rift arose between  Chief\n\nDeCastro and the  Fraternal Order of Police Union (Union).   At a\n\npublic  session of the City Council years later, it was disclosed\n\nthat  several defendants  had discussed beforehand  with DeCastro\n\nthe likelihood  that a competitive examination  would be adminis-\n\ntered and that DeCastro's test-taking skills were weak.  Finally,\n\nit was also disclosed  at the City Council meeting  that DeCastro\n\n                                2\n\nhad attended  a preparatory course in  \"executive development\" on\n\nhis own  time, for  which he  was reimbursed  pursuant to a  City\n\npolicy permitting reimbursement for \"in-service training.\"\n\n          Present at the City Council meeting were several of the\n\nplaintiffs,  all disappointed  applicants  for the  position, and\n\nappellant Linder, counsel to  the Union.  Shortly after  the City\n\nCouncil meeting, two of  the plaintiffs met  briefly  with Linder\n\nand discussed  factual grounds  for a possible  lawsuit in  their\n\nbehalf.   Thereafter, Linder  conducted limited  discussions with\n\nother plaintiffs along similar lines.\n\n          On January 3, 1990, Linder initiated the present action\n\nunder  42 U.S.C.   1983 in  the United States  District Court for\n\nthe District of Rhode Island, charging deprivations of plaintiff-\n\ns' due process right to a fair and impartial promotional examina-\n\ntion as provided by  the City ordinance, and of  an alleged right\n\nof  \"equal protection\" to compete for the position.  Although the\n\ncomplaint pleaded relevant circumstances which the district court\n\nlater  characterized as    \"suspicious,\" see  supra  pp. 2-3,  it\n                                                   \n\nneither alleged     nor asserted facts  sufficient to support  an\n\ninference     that the examination  was either \"rigged\"  to favor\n\nDeCastro or administered or graded unfairly.\n\n          Prior  to  filing the  complaint,  Linder  made a  copy\n\navailable to the City  Solicitor, who advised Linder that  it was\n\n\"unjustified,\" and  warned that  the City  was  likely to  demand\n\nattorney fees for defending against it.  Linder was not deterred.\n\n          Ultimately, the district court entered summary judgment\n\n                                3\n\nfor  all defendants  on the  ground that  \"the complaint  made no\n\nallegations of 'exam  rigging,'\" which was the  essence of plain-\n\ntiffs' claim.

Civ.\n\nP. 11.\n\n          In due  course, the district court  conducted a lengthy\n\nhearing to determine whether the fee request should be allowed on\n                            \n\neither ground.   The amount of  any fee award was  not before the\n\ncourt  at the hearing.   Following the hearing,  the court denied\n\nthe request for an  award under section 1988, on the  ground that\n\nthe plaintiffs  had not  acted in bad  faith.   The court  found,\n\nhowever,  that Linder was subject  to sanction under  Rule 11 for\n\nfiling a  groundless complaint.   The defendants  later requested\n\nfees and costs totalling almost $250,000, which the court reduced\n\nto $75,349.96,  approximately two-thirds of which  was attributed\n\nto  the merits phase and one-third  to the sanctions phase of the\n\ndistrict court litigation.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          All  aspects  of the  Rule  11  sanctions decision  are\n\nreviewed  for abuse  of discretion.

More-\n\nover,  it would  be  impracticable, not  only  to undo  the  harm\n\nactually occasioned defendants, but  to review the district court\n\norder  under the  altered standards  established by  amended Rule\n\n                    \n\n     4Linder argues that he would not  have been sanctioned under\nthe  amended rule, because he would  have withdrawn the complaint\nas allowed under the 21-day \"safe harbor\" provision.  See Fed. R.\n                                                         \nCiv.  P. 11(c)(1)(A) (Dec. 1, 1993); supra note 2.  Linder cannot\n                                          \nhave it both ways, however.  His argument is based on the assump-\ntion  that he  would  have availed  himself  of a  \"safe  harbor\"\nprovision had  he received notice of  the particular deficiencies\n                                                    \nin  the  complaint.   This  retrospective  appraisal ignores  the\nreality that Linder flatly disregarded a substantially equivalent\nwarning from the  City Solicitor  before the  complaint was  ever\nfiled.  See supra p. 3-4.  Thus, Linder's argument cannot prevail\n                 \nunless appellees  failed to point out  particular deficiencies in\nthe complaint.   However, appellees' statement  of relevant facts\non appeal represents,  and Linder  does not deny,  that the  City\nSolicitor \"informed [Linder] of the pleading deficiencies, and of\n                                                         \nthe  City's probable  attempt  to collect  sanctions, before  the\npleading  was even  filed.\"   (Appellees'  Br.  at 16)  (emphasis\nadded).   Since  Linder neither denies  appellees' representation\nnor included the relevant  portions of the hearing  transcript to\nwhich  appellees' statement of facts  cites, see Fed.  R.

It would be unjust to permit yet\na second \"safe harbor\" refuge for Linder to escape responsibility\n        \nfor the expense occasioned an innocent party which forewarned him\nthat  the complaint  was unjustified.   Furthermore, even  if the\ncost and expense occasioned by Linder's sanctionable conduct were\nto be disregarded, it  would be unjust to permit  these satellite\nproceedings  to be further extended by  remanding to the district\ncourt to afford Linder the opportunity to \"withdraw\" a groundless\ncomplaint previously dismissed on the merits.\n\n                                8\n\n11.5   See Hashemi, 784  F.2d at 1583-84  (rejecting claim, under\n                  \n\nvirtually identical 1983 promulgation order, that amended Rule 11\n\nstandards should apply \"because the case was pending on appeal by\n\nthe plaintiff  at  the  time the  Rule  became  effective\");  cf.\n                                                                 \n\nFreund, 956 F.2d  at 363  (refusing to apply  amended rule  which\n      \n\nwould work  \"manifest injustice\").

The district  court found\n\nthat    \n\n          Linder,  who was  also  the attorney  for the\n          Union, was  wearing two hats here.   Although\n          he purported to  represent the plaintiffs  in\n          this case, all his actions were calculated to\n                                                       \n          achieve the goal of  the Union, the ouster of\n                                        \n          DeCastro.

Additionally,  defendants requested  a fee  award against\n\nplaintiffs under 42 U.S.C.   1988 as well, which the court consi-\n\ndered at the same hearing  and later denied.  The claim  that the\n\ndistrict court abused its  discretion by conducting a hearing  to\n\nresolve defendants' fee requests  under Rule 11 and  section 1988\n\nis frivolous.\n\n          Linder  has fallen far short  of a showing  of abuse of\n\ndiscretion.9   Rule  11  contemplates \"giv[ing]  effect to  [its]\n\ncentral  goal of  deterrence,\" Cooter  &amp; Gell,  496 U.S.  at 405,\n                                             \n\nwhile  avoiding  unnecessary  satellite  litigation;  the  proper\n\nbalance is left to the reasoned discretion of the district court,\n\nid.

The appellate  record provided by\nLinder, see supra note 9, does not indicate which issue was first\n                 \ndecided, why the hearing  proceeded to the second issue,  or even\nwhether  Linder preserved  this claim by  asserting it  in timely\nfashion  below.  Moreover, the further inquiries as to the appro-\npriateness and  severity of Rule 11  sanctions were significantly\ninformed  by  the  court's determination  that  not  one but  two\ngrounds existed  for sanctioning  Linder.

Linder does not challenge the individual fee appli-\n\ncations, but asserts that the aggregate hours were not reasonably\n\nrequired  because  defendants did  not  take  proper measures  to\n\nmitigate  fees by  delegating jointly-required  in-court services\n\nand  submitting unitary filings  to avoid unnecessary duplication\n\nof services.

We agree that it was\n                  \n\nreasonable for  the five defendants, in  their individual capaci-\n                                                                 \n\nties, to  obtain representation  by their  own counsel  while the\n    \n\nmerits  of  plaintiffs'  claims  remained  in  litigation,  since\n\ncounsel  to the  City  represented the  individual defendants  in\n\ntheir official  capacities only.   Linder points to  no authority\n                          \n\nfor  the implicit  assumption that reasonable  mitigation efforts\n\nrequire that  the  private interests  of  parties sued  in  their\n\nindividual capacities  must go  unrepresented.  Cf.  Mariani, 983\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at 8  n.5.  Nor  has he  shown that  the respective private\n\ninterests of these individual  defendants during the merits phase\n\ndid  not conflict  to the  point that  mutual representation  was\n\nprecluded.13        Cf. Brandt v.

Thus,  Linder failed  to  demonstrate an  abuse  of\ndiscretion.  See Navarro-Ayala, 968 F.2d at 1425.\n                              \n\n                                17\n\neach attorney on the merits was not excessive.\"  Silva, slip  op.\n                                                      \n\nat 13 (Nov. 5,  1992).   The court also  disallowed all fees  for\n\nlegal services,  except those  services directly rendered  to the\n\nCity,  after the  point  in time  when  it became  clear  that no\n\nconflicts of interest precluded the individual defendants'  joint\n\nrepresentation  by counsel to the City.   See Brandt, 960 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n649  (no failure  to mitigate  where sanctioned  attorney's broad\n\ncomplaint necessitated  investment of extensive attorney  time in\n\ndefense  and district  court carefully  monitored procedure).   A\n\nparty is required to mitigate expenses only insofar as is reason-\n\nable.  Our review of the record  discloses no basis for supposing\n\nthat  the district  court  abused its  discretion  by allowing  a\n\n$53,528.81 reimbursement to the  City for legal services rendered\n\nduring the merits  phase.   See Navarro-Ayala, 968  F.2d at  1426\n                                             \n\n(\"When the  district court settles  upon a monetary  sanction and\n\nfixes a dollar amount, a reviewing  tribunal should defer, within\n\nbroad  limits, to the  district court's exercise  of its informed\n\ndiscretion.  Nevertheless,  the court of appeals  must be careful\n\nnot  merely  to  'rubber-stamp  the  decisions  of  the  district\n\ncourt.'\") (citation omitted).\n\n          b.   Sanctions Phase\n                              \n\n          The  district court  disallowed  all fees  requested in\n\nrelation to  the sanctions  phase  of the  litigation except  for\n\n                                18\n\nthose incurred by the  City.14  The  court found that counsel  to\n\nthe individual defendants  had been notified in  advance that the\n\nCity no  longer believed there  existed any conflict  of interest\n\nprecluding   joint representation.   Thus, the court allowed only\n\n$21,821.15 in total fees and costs for 188 out of over 1500 hours\n\nexpended  by  all  counsel  representing  defendants  during  the\n\nsanctions phase.  Linder does not challenge the reasonableness of\n\nthe fees incurred by the City in the sanctions phase.15\n\n          We therefore affirm the district court judgement.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     14The  district court  adjusted for  the additional  hearing\ntime required on  the section  1988 motion by  allowing fees  for\nonly 50% of the total time expended by defendants' counsel at the\nsanctions hearing, a finding not challenged on appeal.\n\n     15Linder  argues, however,  apparently for  the  first time,\nthat  the district court abused its discretion by failing to take\ninto account his financial  ability to respond to the  fee award.\nEven assuming this claim has  been preserved, Linder presented no\nevidence concerning  his financial condition, nor  has he alleged\nfinancial  inability to satisfy the sanction.  Thus, there was no\nabuse  of discretion.  See  White v.
