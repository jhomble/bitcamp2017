George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jennifer Appleyard for appellant.\n     Kelly Lawrence, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        August 11, 2009\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. After a jury trial, appellant Paul\n\nHicks was convicted of being a felon in possession of ammunition in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and of possession with intent to\n\ndistribute crack and powder cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a)(1). He now appeals his conviction and sentence, requiring\n\nus to consider, among other things: whether a warrant for the\n\nsearch of his residence was supported by probable cause, whether\n\nthe district court wrongfully denied appellant a Franks hearing to\n\nestablish the veracity of the affidavit supporting the search\n\nwarrant, and whether it was error to admit evidence of appellant's\n\nthree prior drug convictions and other bad acts.                         We reject\n\nappellant's claims of error and affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           On January 20, 2005, agents of the Massachusetts State\n\nPolice   conducted   a   search       of   15   Cabot    Street    in    Brockton,\n\nMassachusetts   pursuant   to     a    \"no-knock\"       search    warrant   issued\n\nearlier that day by a magistrate judge.                      Massachusetts State\n\nTrooper James Long, who had been investigating appellant for weeks\n\nprior to the search, had executed an affidavit in support of the\n\nsearch warrant.\n\n           Long's    affidavit    stated        that    in    December    2004,   a\n\nconfidential informant (CI) told him that he or she had been\n\npurchasing crack cocaine from a man known as \"Pudgie.\"                      The CI\n\nidentified appellant as \"Pudgie\" in a photograph.                  The affidavit\n\n                                       -2-\n\fstated that the CI then participated in two controlled purchases of\n\ncrack cocaine from appellant.   The first transaction occurred \"on\n\nor about\" January 7, 2005 and the second \"on or about\" January 16,\n\n2005. The affidavit explained that Long and other officers working\n\nthe case were familiar with 15 Cabot Street from a previous\n\nnarcotics investigation that had resulted in a search of the\n\nresidence in January 2004.   Officer Long averred in the affidavit\n\nthat he believed that 15 Cabot Street was a location maintained by\n\nHicks to prepare and distribute drugs.\n\n            The search was executed by a team of law enforcement\n\nofficers.    They found appellant in a bedroom, sitting on the edge\n\nof a bed and wearing nothing but a towel.    He was the only adult in\n\nthe house.   In the drawer of a night stand and within arm's reach\n\nof where appellant had been sitting on the bed, the officers\n\ndiscovered a cellular telephone, a box of ammunition, a weapon\n\nholster, a men's watch, a key, and cash.    They also found $2,090 in\n\ncash in the pocket of a leather jacket hanging in the closet.     In\n\nthe basement of the home, the officers found a digital scale,\n\nplastic baggies, baking soda, and, inside the hollow legs of a\n\nweight bench, 20.89 grams of crack cocaine and 125.51 grams of\n\npowder cocaine.     In the kitchen, the officers found two more\n\ndigital scales.   Hicks was arrested and subsequently charged with\n\nbeing a felon in possession of ammunition and possession with\n\nintent to distribute crack and powder cocaine.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          In March 2006, appellant moved in the district court to\n\nsuppress the evidence seized during the search of 15 Cabot Street,\n\nclaiming that the search warrant had been defective. Specifically,\n\nhe argued that Trooper Long's affidavit did not establish probable\n\ncause to believe that evidence of narcotics dealing would be found\n\nat 15 Cabot Street.    He claimed that Long's affidavit did not\n\nconnect the CI's controlled purchases to 15 Cabot Street or show\n\nthat appellant was himself connected to the residence.\n\n          The district court denied the motion to suppress, finding\n\nthat the warrant affidavit had established probable cause.     The\n\ncourt further found that even if there had not been probable cause\n\nto issue the warrant, the search was justified by the rule of\n\nUnited States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984), because a reasonable\n\nofficer could have thought that the affidavit had established\n\nprobable cause.\n\n          Shortly before trial, appellant requested a hearing under\n\nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), (a \"Franks hearing\") to\n\ncontest allegedly false statements in the search warrant affidavit.\n\nThe district court denied the motion, finding that defendant had\n\nfailed to make the preliminary showing necessary to warrant a\n\nFranks hearing.\n\n          A jury trial commenced on October 16, 2006 and lasted\n\nfour days.   The government presented the testimony of several law\n\nenforcement agents, including that of Trooper Long and others who\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fhad participated in the investigation and eventual search of 15\n\nCabot Street.      The government's final witness was Massachusetts\n\nState   Police   Officer   Dean     Levangie.      Officer    Levangie   had\n\nparticipated in well over 300 crack cocaine investigations, an\n\nestimated seventy percent of which had occurred in Brockton, and\n\ntestified as an expert in Brockton narcotics investigations.\n\n           After   the   district    court's    rejection    of   appellant's\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 29, appellant presented the testimony of his\n\nmother, Rosemarie Hicks.      The thrust of appellant's defense was\n\nthat he lived with his parents and was only an occasional guest at\n\n15 Cabot Street, that the drugs and paraphernalia found at the\n\nresidence did not belong to him, and that he had no intent to\n\nexercise control over or distribute the drugs.              At the close of\n\nevidence, he did not renew his Rule 29 motion.         The jury found him\n\nguilty of all three counts.       He was subsequently sentenced to 360\n\nmonths of imprisonment for each of the three counts, to be served\n\nconcurrently, followed by an eight-year term of supervised release.\n\nAppellant filed this timely appeal.\n\n                                    II.\n\n           Appellant argues that the district court erroneously\n\ndenied his motion to suppress the evidence seized in the search of\n\n15 Cabot Street because the application in support of the search\n\nwarrant failed to establish probable cause. We employ a two-tiered\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fstandard of review to analyze such claims.            Questions of law,\n\nincluding the question of whether a given set of facts gives rise\n\nto probable cause, are reviewed de novo, United States v. Woodbury,\n\n511 F.3d 93, 96 (1st Cir. 2007), while factual findings are\n\nreviewed for clear error, United States v. Ribeiro, 397 F.3d 43, 48\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).    We \"give significant deference to the magistrate\n\njudge's   initial   evaluation,\"    and   reverse   \"only   if   we   see   no\n\n'substantial basis' for concluding that probable cause existed.\"\n\nId. (quoting United States v. Feliz, 182 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.\n\n1999)).\n\n           A search warrant application must demonstrate probable\n\ncause to believe that: 1) a crime has been committed, and 2)\n\n\"enumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place to\n\nbe searched -- the so-called 'nexus' element.\" Id. In considering\n\nwhether   a   warrant   affidavit    establishes     probable     cause,     a\n\nmagistrate judge's task is \"'to make a practical, common-sense\n\ndecision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the\n\naffidavit before him . . . there is a fair probability that\n\ncontraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular\n\nplace.'\" Feliz, 182 F.3d at 86 (modification in original) (quoting\n\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983)).\n\n           Appellant argues that the warrant affidavit was faulty\n\nbecause it failed to establish probable cause to believe that there\n\nwas a nexus between the controlled purchases and 15 Cabot Street,\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fand that the evidence found at the home should therefore have been\n\nsuppressed. We disagree. Trooper Long's warrant affidavit supplied\n\na host of evidence to establish a \"fair probability\" that evidence\n\nof the narcotics trade would be found at 15 Cabot Street.\n\n              According to the affidavit, the CI gave Officer Long the\n\ncrack cocaine after each controlled purchase and stated that it had\n\nbeen purchased from \"Pudgie.\" The affidavit also described reliable\n\ninformation provided by the CI in earlier investigations and stated\n\nthat Long knew \"Pudgie\" to be the nickname of appellant, who had\n\nseveral prior convictions for drug distribution offenses.                     The\n\naffidavit stated that officers followed a black Mazda van directly\n\nto 15 Cabot Street after its driver, reported by the CI to be\n\n\"Pudgie,\" had used the van to deliver drugs during a controlled\n\npurchase. Officers later observed the van parked at the home during\n\nthe late evening and early morning hours.            Utilities at 15 Cabot\n\nStreet were in appellant's name.\n\n              Trooper Long and other officers' knowledge and experience\n\nwith 15 Cabot Street also linked appellant to the residence.                  The\n\ncell phone number dialed by the CI to reach \"Pudgie\" was registered\n\nto Edward Robinson, who had previously sold crack cocaine to law\n\nenforcement     officers    and   had    been   arrested   after   an     earlier\n\ninvestigation and search of 15 Cabot Street. Robinson was connected\n\nto appellant because during the earlier investigation he had used\n\na   vehicle    registered   to    appellant's    father    to   deliver    drugs.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fFurthermore, 15 Cabot Street was owned by Renee Yarrell, who was\n\nknown by officers to be appellant's girlfriend and who had also sold\n\ndrugs to undercover officers during the earlier investigation of 15\n\nCabot Street.          Finally, the search warrant affidavit detailed\n\nTrooper Long's experience and training in narcotics investigations\n\nand his belief that 15 Cabot Street would contain evidence of\n\nappellant's preparation and distribution of narcotics.\n\n            In Ribeiro, 397 F.3d at 49-50, we found that the nexus\n\nelement was satisfied when police officers conducting surveillance\n\nhad seen the defendant leaving his home shortly before participating\n\nin a controlled narcotics purchase.               Analyzing whether there was\n\nprobable cause to establish the nexus requirement, we found it\n\n\"compelling\" that the defendant had been able to quickly respond to\n\nthe undercover officer's requests for narcotics, which indicated\n\nthat he kept a readily accessible supply of narcotics.               Id. at 50.\n\nThe nexus requirement was also supported by information obtained\n\nthrough surveillance and by the affiant officer's averment that he\n\nknew drug traffickers frequently stored drugs, cash, and other\n\nevidence of the drug trade in their homes.             Id. at 51-52.\n\n            As    in    Ribeiro,   the     circumstances   set    forth   in   the\n\naffidavit    --        which   included     the    surveillance    information,\n\nappellant's prior convictions and his connections to known drug\n\ndealers who operated out of 15 Cabot Street, and observations drawn\n\nfrom Trooper Long's training and experience -- established a fair\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fprobability that appellant lived at 15 Cabot Street and that\n\nevidence of his drug dealing would be found there. Because we agree\n\nwith the magistrate judge's determination that probable cause\n\nexisted to search 15 Cabot Street, we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of appellant's motion to suppress the fruits of the search.1\n\n                                       III.\n\n              Appellant argues that the district court erroneously\n\ndenied      his   motion   for   a   hearing   to   contest   the   veracity   of\n\nstatements made by Trooper Long in the warrant affidavit.                 Under\n\nFranks, 438 U.S. at 155, a defendant may request an evidentiary\n\nhearing to challenge the truthfulness of statements made by law\n\nenforcement agents in a search warrant affidavit.                   To obtain a\n\nFranks hearing, a defendant must make \"a substantial preliminary\n\nshowing\" that: 1) the warrant affidavit contains a false statement\n\nmade \"knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for\n\nthe truth,\" id. at 155-56,             and 2) that \"the allegedly false\n\nstatement was necessary to the finding of probable cause.\"               Id. at\n\n156.       We review the denial of a Franks hearing for clear error,\n\nUnited States v. Materas, 483 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2007), which\n\nexists only when we are \"'left with the definite and firm conviction\n\n\n\n       1\n        The government argues, alternatively, that even if there\nwere no probable cause for the search warrant, the evidence should\nnot have been suppressed because of the good-faith exception of\nLeon, 468 U.S. at 913.      Because we find that probable cause\nexisted, we need not reach that alternative argument. See Ribeiro,\n397 F.3d at 52 n.7.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fthat a mistake has been committed.'\" United States v. Castillo, 287\n\nF.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Anderson v.   City of Bessemer,\n\n470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985)).\n\n          In his motion for a Franks hearing, appellant challenged\n\nthe veracity of Trooper Long's statement that the second controlled\n\npurchase happened \"on or about\" January 16, 2005.       The district\n\ncourt denied the motion, finding that appellant had failed to make\n\nthe necessary preliminary showing that the warrant contained a false\n\nstatement made knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth,\n\nand that, even if the challenged statement were false, it was not\n\nnecessary to the finding of probable cause.\n\n          Appellant emphasizes on appeal, as he did in the district\n\ncourt, that the warrant states that the second controlled purchase\n\noccurred \"on or about\" January 16, 2005, while Trooper Long's work\n\nrecords show that he did not work January 15, 16, or 17.   Appellant\n\nfinds this possible discrepancy a sufficient showing that Trooper\n\nlong knowingly included a falsehood in the affidavit.\n\n          As the government points out, the use of the phrase \"on\n\nor about\" when describing the time frame of a controlled drug\n\npurchase is a common police practice, used to protect the identity\n\nof a confidential informant.   In United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d\n\n1005, 1007 (1st Cir. 1992), we found that there was \"nothing\n\ninherently contradictory or incredible\" in the affiant's assertion\n\nthat a controlled purchase had occurred \"within the past few days\"\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fof a warrant's execution, when the purchase had actually occurred\n\nthe day of the execution.         Id. at 1008.        We remarked that the\n\ndescription's vagueness was due to the common police practice of not\n\nstating precisely the time of the buy in order to protect the\n\nconfidentiality of the informant.            Id.; see also United States v.\n\nDavis, 1996 WL 521202, at *6 (1st Cir. Sept. 16, 1996) (\"While\n\nfurther detail about the controlled buy might have been desirable,\n\nthe lack of specificity about the date of the buy or the quantity\n\ninvolved is not necessarily probative of falsity.              The concern for\n\nkeeping   the   buyer's    identify     confidential    is     a   more   likely\n\nexplanation for the lack of those details.\").               As in Carty, there\n\nis \"nothing inherently contradictory\" in Trooper Long's description\n\nof the date of the controlled purchase: the fact that the buy may\n\nnot have occurred within one day of the date referenced in Trooper\n\nLong's affidavit simply does not mean that it did not occur \"about\"\n\nthat date.\n\n            Further, even if appellant could show that Trooper Long\n\nmade a knowingly false         statement, he has not shown that the\n\nchallenged statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause.\n\n\"[T]o determine the sufficiency of the affidavit, excluding the\n\ncontested    sentence,    we   look   to   'whether   the    totality     of   the\n\ncircumstances stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable cause\n\nto search either the premises or the person.'\"               United States v.\n\nBarnes, 492 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v.\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fKhounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir. 1997)).          Even if the exact\n\ndates had not been set forth in the affidavit at all, the \"totality\n\nof the circumstances\" stated in the warrant affidavit was more than\n\nsufficient to establish probable cause to believe that evidence of\n\na crime would be found at 15 Cabot Street.\n\n           Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of\n\ndefendant's motion for a Franks hearing.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n           Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting the jury's verdict and the district court's denial of his\n\nRule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts.2                  We\n\nnormally review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and\n\nthe denial of Rule 29 motions by asking whether, taking the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, a rational jury\n\ncould have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnited States v. Thompson, 449 F.3d 267, 275 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\nUnited   States   v.   Morillo,   158   F.3d   18,   22   (1st   Cir.   1998)\n\n(challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and Rule 29 motions\n\n\n\n     2\n         In parts V and VI of this opinion, we address the\nadmissibility of certain evidence.      Often, in criminal cases\ninvolving challenges to both the admissibility of certain evidence\nand the sufficiency of the evidence to support convictions, we will\naddress the admissibility issues first to determine which evidence\nis appropriately considered in the sufficiency of the evidence\nanalysis. See, e.g., United States v. Avilés-Colón, 536 F.3d 1, 13\n(1st Cir. 2008). We choose a different sequence here because the\nsufficiency of the evidence analysis helps to illuminate the\ndiscussion of the admissibility issues in parts V and VI.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fpresent a single issue for review).     Because appellant failed to\n\nrenew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence,\n\nhowever, we will reverse his convictions \"only if the verdict\n\nthreatens to work a clear and gross injustice.\"    United States v.\n\nGobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nA. The Cocaine Charges\n\n          We begin with the drug charges.     21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)\n\nmakes it illegal to distribute or possess with intent to distribute\n\na controlled substance.      Because appellant did not possess the\n\ncocaine on his person at the time of the search, the government\n\nrelied on a theory of constructive possession, which \"'exists when\n\na person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to\n\nexercise dominion and control over an object either directly or\n\nthrough others.'\"   United States v. García-Carrasquillo, 483 F.3d\n\n124, 130 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. McClean, 409 F.3d\n\n492, 501 (1st Cir. 2005)).   Such possession \"can be joint, does not\n\nrequire actual ownership . . . and can be established through\n\ncircumstantial evidence, though 'mere presence or association with\n\nanother who possessed the contraband is insufficient.'\"      United\n\nStates v. DeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 67 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Wight, 968 F.3d 1393, 1397 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n          Defendant argues, in the main, that he was only at 15\n\nCabot Street on the day of the search because he was babysitting\n\nYarrell's children and that he was not involved with the narcotics\n\n\n                                -13-\n\ftrade being run out of the home.         He points out that he was not\n\nlinked to the drugs through physical possession or evidence such as\n\nfingerprints.     That is true.   Nevertheless, other circumstantial\n\nevidence permitted a reasonable jury to conclude that appellant\n\nlived at 15 Cabot Street, knew of the drugs' existence, had the\n\npower and intention to exercise control over them, and had the\n\nintention to distribute them.\n\n          Cable, electricity, and telephone bills for service at 15\n\nCabot Street were in appellant's name.       Inside the home, officers\n\nfound a personal letter addressed to appellant at 15 Cabot Street\n\nas well as his student loan statement.      Moreover, when the officers\n\nexecuting the warrant entered the home, they saw appellant sitting\n\non the edge of the bed in the master bedroom, wrapped in a damp\n\ntowel as if he had just showered.           Inside the bedroom was a\n\nphotograph of appellant and his girlfriend, Yarrell, who owned the\n\nhouse.   Men's clothes were on the bedroom floor and inside the\n\nbedroom closet.    In the drawer of the night stand there was a cell\n\nphone registered to appellant, a men's watch, and cash.\n\n          Evidence of the drug trade -- such as digital scales,\n\nplastic baggies, baking soda, and large amounts of cash -- was\n\nscattered throughout the home.     There was evidence of appellant's\n\nprior involvement with the distribution of cocaine, indicating his\n\nfamiliarity with these items.     Officer Levangie testified that, in\n\naddition to drugs themselves, plastic bags, scales, and money were\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\famong the items he had frequently seen and seized during drug\n\nsearches in Brockton, and that he had seen baking soda used by\n\nBrockton drug dealers as a cutting agent.               The government also\n\nintroduced into evidence a recording of a collect call appellant\n\nhad   made   to   Yarrell   while   he   was   in   a   Massachusetts   jail\n\napproximately one year prior to the search. On the call, appellant\n\ntold Yarrell how to package and sell cocaine at 15 Cabot Street.\n\nThis evidence directly contradicted appellant's theory that he was\n\nan innocent bystander to the drug trade happening within Yarrell's\n\nhome.\n\n             Further, $2,090 in cash was found in the pocket of a\n\nmen's jacket inside the bedroom where appellant was sitting at the\n\ninception of the search.     Officer Levangie testified that Brockton\n\ndrug dealers tend to keep large amounts of cash on hand and readily\n\navailable; appellant was the nearest person to the cash and the\n\nonly adult in the home.     Officer Levangie also testified that drug\n\ndealers often change their telephone numbers and make frequent\n\nphone calls.      The cell phone found in the drawer was registered to\n\nappellant, had been activated just two days before, and had already\n\nbeen used to make 161 phone calls.             Finally, Officer Levangie\n\nopined that the cocaine seized from 15 Cabot Street had a street\n\nvalue in excess of $12,000, a quantity consistent with narcotics\n\ndealing rather than personal use.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            Taking this evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\njury's verdict, we find that a reasonable jury could convict\n\nappellant   for     possession   with   intent    to    distribute    cocaine.\n\nFailing to meet our regular standard of review for Rule 29 and\n\nevidentiary sufficiency challenges, appellant necessarily also\n\nfails to meet the more stringent \"clear and gross injustice\"\n\nstandard.    See Gobbi, 471 F.3d at 309.\n\nB. The Ammunition Charge\n\n            18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) makes it illegal for \"any person --\n\nwho has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by\n\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . to possess in or\n\naffecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition . . . .\"                    Such\n\npossession may be constructive.         DeCologero, 530 F.3d at 67.          The\n\ngovernment introduced uncontroverted evidence that the appellant is\n\na convicted felon and that the ammunition found in the night stand\n\nhad traveled through interstate commerce.               It also introduced\n\nevidence sufficient to establish constructive possession of the\n\nbullets.      The   ammunition    was   located    in    a   drawer   next    to\n\nappellant's cellular telephone, a men's watch, a key, and cash, and\n\nwas within arm's reach of appellant when the officers entered the\n\nbedroom.    Furthermore, the cellular telephone lying next to the\n\nbullets had been used to make a phone call thirty minutes before\n\nthe search.       Finally, Officer Levangie testified that it was\n\n\"common practice\" for Brockton drug dealers to hide weapons or pass\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthem   off   to     \"co-workers,\"      providing    an    explanation     for    why\n\nappellant would possess ammunition although he was not found to be\n\nin possession of a gun.            A rational jury could have found that\n\nappellant had the requisite \"power and intention . . . to exercise\n\ndominion and control\" over the items in the drawer, including the\n\nammunition.       McClean, 409 F.3d at 501.\n\n             As with the drug charges, we find no \"clear and gross\n\ninjustice\" in the district court's denial of appellant's Rule 29\n\nmotion on the weapons charge.\n\n                                        V.\n\n             Appellant objects to the admission of certain \"prior act\"\n\nevidence at trial. Before trial, the government notified the court\n\nand defense counsel that it intended to introduce evidence that the\n\ndefendant     had     three    prior     cocaine-related           convictions       in\n\nMassachusetts state court: two for possession with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine and one for distribution of cocaine.                    It also\n\nsought   permission     to    admit    into    evidence      the   recording    of    a\n\ntelephone    call     made    by   appellant     from    a    Massachusetts      jail\n\napproximately one year before the incidents leading to Trooper\n\nLong's search of 15 Cabot Street.             On the collect phone call, which\n\nappellant    was     warned    would    be    recorded,      appellant   gave     his\n\ngirlfriend, Yarrell, instructions on how to package and sell\n\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fcocaine stashed at 15 Cabot Street and inquired about the finances\n\nof his narcotics operation.3\n\n               The government argued that the prior convictions and the\n\ntelephone call were relevant to show the defendant's knowledge of\n\nthe cocaine in the home and his intent to distribute the cocaine\n\nand, as such, should not be excluded by Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n404(b)'s prohibition against prior bad act evidence.4 The district\n\ncourt       agreed,    admitting   the    convictions   as   relevant   to   the\n\ndefendant's knowledge and intent.5              The court reserved its ruling\n\non the phone call, but at trial determined that it was also\n\nadmissible.           We review a district court's determination about\n\nwhether to exclude evidence under Rule 404(b) or 403 for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.       United States v. Tse, 375 F.3d 148, 155 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n\n        3\n        The statements in the telephone calls were not hearsay\nbecause they were \"admission[s] by a party-opponent.\"      Fed. R.\nEvid. 801(d)(2); see id. (admissions are, inter alia, statements\noffered against a party that are \"the party's own statement\"); 2\nKenneth S. Brown, McCormick on Evidence § 254 (6th ed. 2006)\n(\"Admissions are simply words or actions inconsistent with the\nparty's position at trial, relevant to the substantive issues in\nthe case, and offered against the party.\"). Because the statements\ndescribed appellant's own prior bad acts, Rule 404(b) was\nimplicated and the appropriateness of admitting the testimony was\nevaluated under that rule.\n        4\n        The government did not seek to admit the convictions for\nthe purpose of impeaching the defendant, who did not testify. See\nFed. R. Evid. 609(a).\n     5\n        The district court also noted that evidence of one prior\nfelony conviction was necessary to establish the felon element of\nthe § 922(g)(1) charge.\n\n                                         -18-\n\f               Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), evidence of prior\n\nbad acts is not admissible to show the actor's bad character or\n\npropensity to commit crime.              United States v. Arias-Montoya, 967\n\nF.2d    708,    709   (1st    Cir.     1992).      \"While      logically      relevant,\n\n'propensity' or 'bad character' evidence is deemed to carry an\n\nunacceptable risk that the jury will convict the defendant for\n\ncrimes other than those charged,\" id., or simply because \"a bad\n\nperson deserves punishment,\" United States v. Moccia, 681 F.2d 61,\n\n63 (1st Cir. 1982). Prior act evidence, however, is admissible for\n\nany other relevant purpose, such as to show \"motive, opportunity,\n\nintent, preparation, [or] plan . . .\"                Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).\n\n               This circuit imposes a two-part test to determine whether\n\nprior act evidence is admissible.                United States v. Whitney, 524\n\nF.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 2008).            First, a court must ask whether the\n\nproffered      evidence      has   a    \"special\"    relevance,        i.e.,     a   non-\n\npropensity relevance.         Id.      Next, the court must determine whether\n\nthe evidence should be excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403,\n\nwhich allows courts to exclude relevant evidence \"if its probative\n\nvalue    is     substantially       outweighed      by   the    danger     of    unfair\n\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\n\nconsiderations        of   undue       delay,    waste   of    time,     or     needless\n\npresentation of cumulative evidence.\"                Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n               Here, the challenged evidence passed the first prong of\n\nthe test because of its \"special\" relevance to appellant's defense\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fthat he was innocently in the home to babysit the children at the\n\ntime of the search.          A person with previous convictions for\n\npossession with intent to distribute crack and powder cocaine would\n\nhave been more likely to recognize the drug trade paraphernalia\n\nthat was scattered about the home, such as baking powder, plastic\n\nbaggies, digital scales, and cash.            See Moccia, 681 F.2d at 63\n\n(prior marijuana conviction admissible to support the government's\n\ntheory that \"one who lives on a farm with marijuana in the freezer\n\nroom   and   under   the   chicken   coop    and   has   a   prior   possession\n\nconviction is more likely to know about the presence of marijuana\n\nthan one who lives on such a farm and does not have a past\n\npossession conviction.\"). The prior convictions were also relevant\n\nto the issue of appellant's intent to exercise control over the\n\ndrugs in the home.     The recorded phone call was similarly relevant\n\nto appellant's knowledge of the accouterments of the drug trade in\n\nthe home and his intent to exercise control over the drugs.\n\n             Because the prior act evidence had special relevance, we\n\nmust next ask whether the evidence should have been excluded under\n\nRule 403 because its probative value was \"substantially outweighed\"\n\nby its danger of unfair prejudice.          Fed. R. Evid. 403; Whitney, 524\n\nF.3d at 141.     Even though the writer of this opinion is concerned\n\nabout the \"piling on\" of multiple criminal convictions when a\n\nlesser number might suffice to establish the proposition of concern\n\nto the government, a majority of the panel does not believe that\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fthe district judge abused his discretion in this instance, taking\n\nthe view as well that the piling on argument was not even properly\n\nmade in the district court or advanced in this form on appeal.6\n\n          We   review   non-constitutional   evidentiary   errors   for\n\nharmlessness; an error is harmless if it is \"highly probable that\n\nthe error did not influence the verdict.\"          United States v.\n\nRoberson, 459 F.3d 39, 49 (1st Cir. 2006) (quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).   Even if there was an error in the admission of\n\nthe three prior felony convictions (and a majority of the panel\n\ndoes not suggest that there was), that error was harmless in light\n\n\n     6\n       Unlike my colleagues, I conclude that there was an abuse of\ndiscretion in the district court's admission of appellant's three\nprior felony convictions and that the issue was properly raised\nbelow and on appeal. Therefore, I would have preferred to address\nthe admissibility issue directly and thereby give some content to\nour oft-stated but unhelpful caution that the government and the\ndistrict court should \"be careful as to the admission of extrinsic\nact evidence under Rule 404(b).\" Arias-Montoya, 967 F.2d at 713\n(quotations and modifications omitted); see also United States v.\nGarcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d 209, 221 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v.\nFlores-Pérez, 849 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1988).   Here, the admission\nof the telephone recording and one of the prior convictions was\nappropriate, given appellant's claim that he was innocently at 15\nCabot Street.    However, the probative value of the other two\ncocaine convictions was \"substantially outweighed by the danger of\nunfair prejudice . . . [and the] needless presentation of\ncumulative evidence.\"    Fed. R. Evid. 403. The evidence of the\nphone call, which was powerfully inculpatory, and a single prior\ndrug conviction would have allowed the government to challenge\nappellant's claim of innocence without incurring the risk at the\nheart of Rule 404 -- the danger that \"a jury will convict for\ncrimes other than those charged -- or that, uncertain of guilt, it\nwill   convict    anyway   because    a   bad    person   deserves\npunishment . . . .\" Moccia, 681 F.2d at 63. Here the government\nincurred that risk by pressing for the admission of all three\nconvictions.    Fortunately for the government, however, the\nresulting error was harmless.\n\n                                -21-\n\fof   the   other    overwhelming     evidence     against     appellant,    which\n\nincluded the copious drug paraphernalia in the home where he\n\nresided, the cell phone records that fit the pattern of a drug\n\ndealer, and the ammunition and cash found in his possession.                   See\n\nsupra Part IV.\n\n                                       VI.\n\n            Appellant challenges the admission of the jail call to\n\nYarrell on a different ground, arguing that the admission of\n\nYarrell's recorded statements violated his Sixth Amendment rights\n\nas articulated by the Supreme Court in Crawford v. Washington, 541\n\nU.S. 36 (2004).      Under Crawford, \"a declarant's 'testimonial' out-\n\nof-court statement is not admissible under the Confrontation Clause\n\nunless (1) the declarant testifies, or (2) the defendant had a\n\nprior   opportunity     for   cross-examination        and   the   declarant    is\n\nunavailable, or (3) the evidence is admitted for purposes other\n\nthan establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\" United States\n\nv. Maher, 454 F.3d 13, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2006) (citations omitted).\n\n            Yarrell's statements were not admitted to prove the truth\n\nof   the   matter     asserted   but    rather    to    provide    context     for\n\nappellants' statements, and thus did not violate the Confrontation\n\nClause.    See United States v. Walter, 434 F.3d 30, 33-34 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (recorded statements of a non-testifying informant were\n\nadmissible    to    show   context     of    defendant's     conversation    with\n\ninformant).        During the phone conversation, appellant inquired\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fabout the status of money and drugs left with Yarrell.         For\n\nexample, the following exchanges were recorded:\n\n          Hicks: I left you with three two-and-a-halfs,\n          I mean, two-and-a-quarter, whatever, and I\n          left you with three two-and-a-quarters. There\n          was three sets of dimes. Am I right?\n\n          Yarrell: Yup.\n\n          Hicks: That's almost $17,000 worth of shit,\n          $16,000 . . . Now, plus I left you with almost\n          seven Gs in cash, if I'm not mistaken, like\n          65, we'll say 65 even though it was more than\n          65. It was --\n\n          Yarrell: No. It was 66.\n\n          Hicks: All right, 6,600, so almost seven Gs in\n          cash. Now, you're telling me you got like two\n          Gs worth of stuff left and the other powder\n          stuff.\n          . . .\n          Hicks: I know for a fact I left you with\n          almost eight things.\n\n          Yarrell: with what?\n\n          Hicks: Well, six. Let's say six things, not\n          including the raw food because the raw food is\n          like two things alone so let's say six . . .\n          What . . . you been doing with my money?\n\nThe statements made by Yarrell, little more than brief responses to\n\nHicks's much more detailed statements, were unquestionably admitted\n\nto provide context for the statements of appellant.   Because they\n\nwere not entered for the truth of the matter asserted, they did not\n\nimplicate the Confrontation Clause.\n\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f                                       VII.\n\n             Appellant argues that the trial court improperly admitted\n\nOfficer Levangie's expert testimony about the use of firearms by\n\nBrockton drug dealers.        We review this challenge to the admission\n\nof expert testimony for abuse of discretion.                  United States v.\n\nGiambro,      544      F.3d      26,      32      (1st       Cir.     2008).\n\n             Characterizing       Officer       Levangie's      testimony       as\n\n\"profiling\" testimony, appellant argues that it was improper expert\n\ntestimony that invaded the fact-finding function of the jury.\n\nSpecifically, he objects to Officer Levangie's testimony that\n\nweapons are prevalent among drug dealers in Brockton and that it is\n\n\"common practice\" for weapons to be hidden or passed off between\n\ndealers and \"co-workers\" who sell drugs for them.\n\n             This   testimony    was   directly    relevant     to   appellant's\n\nargument,    suggested   during    cross       examination    and    repeated   in\n\nclosing argument, that he was not linked to the bullets because he\n\nwas not found in possession of a gun.             Officer Levangie, who has\n\nextensive experience investigating narcotics dealers in Brockton,\n\nwas   well   qualified   to     explain   why    appellant     was    found   with\n\nammunition and not a firearm.          That was a proper subject of expert\n\ntestimony because it \"assist[ed] the trier of fact to understand\n\nthe evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"            Fed. R. Evid. 702.7\n\n\n\n      7\n        Appellant   does  not   object             to    Officer      Levangie's\nqualification as an expert witness.\n\n                                       -24-\n\fThe average juror might not understand the fluid exchange of\n\nweapons among drug dealers in Brockton and thus might find it odd\n\nthat a drug dealer would possess ammunition but no weapon.\n\n            In United States v. Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d 1, 14-15 (1st\n\nCir.    2002),    we   explained   that    expert    testimony   was    properly\n\nadmitted to explain how Puerto Rican drug dealers use Global\n\nPositioning Systems to facilitate air drops and cellular telephones\n\nto     enable    communication     among     boats   --   subjects     similarly\n\nunfamiliar to the average juror.           We find no abuse of discretion in\n\nthe district court's admission of Officer Levangie's testimony\n\nabout the prevalence and use of firearms among drug dealers in\n\nBrockton.\n\n                                     VIII.\n\n            Finally, appellant objects to his sentence, claiming that\n\nhis Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated because the\n\nprior convictions that made him eligible to be sentenced as an\n\narmed career criminal, 18 U.S.C. § 924, and a career offender,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.    The Supreme Court has stated that the question of whether\n\na defendant has a predicate conviction \"is exempt from the general\n\nrule that a jury must find any fact that raises a sentence above\n\nthe statutorily-prescribed maximum.\"            United States v. Duval, 496\n\nF.3d 64, 80 (1st Cir. 2007) (describing Almendarez-Torres v. United\n\n\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fStates, 523 U.S. 224, 247 (1998)).   Bound by this precedent, we\n\nreject appellant's Sixth Amendment challenge to his sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -26-\n\f",

Massachusetts State Trooper James Long, who had been investigating appellant for weeks prior to the search, had executed an affidavit in support of the search warrant.</p>\n<p>Long's affidavit stated that in December 2004, a confidential informant (CI) told him that he or she had been purchasing crack cocaine from a man known as \"Pudgie.\" The CI identified appellant as \"Pudgie\" in a photograph. The affidavit stated that the CI then participated in two controlled purchases of crack cocaine from appellant. The first transaction occurred \"on or about\" January 7, 2005 and the second \"on or about\" January 16, 2005. The affidavit explained that Long and other officers working the case were familiar with 15 Cabot Street from a previous narcotics investigation that had resulted in a search of the residence in January 2004. Officer Long averred in the affidavit that he believed that 15 Cabot Street was a location maintained by Hicks to prepare and distribute drugs.</p>\n<p>The search was executed by a team of law enforcement officers. They found appellant in a bedroom, sitting on the edge of a bed and wearing nothing but a towel. He was the only adult in the house. In the drawer of a night stand and within arm's reach of where appellant had been sitting on the bed, the officers discovered a cellular telephone, a box of ammunition, a weapon holster, a men's watch, a key, and cash. They also found $2,090 in cash in the pocket of a leather jacket hanging in the closet. In the basement of the home, the officers found a digital scale, plastic baggies, baking soda, and, inside the hollow legs of a weight bench, 20.89 grams of crack cocaine and 125.51 grams of powder cocaine. In the kitchen, the officers found two more digital scales. Hicks was arrested and subsequently charged with being a felon in possession of ammunition and possession with intent to distribute crack and powder cocaine.</p>\n<p>In March 2006, appellant moved in the district court to suppress the evidence seized during the search of 15 Cabot Street, claiming that the search warrant had been defective. Specifically, he argued that Trooper Long's affidavit did not establish probable cause to believe that evidence of narcotics dealing would be found at 15 Cabot Street. He claimed that Long's affidavit did not connect the CI's controlled purchases to 15 Cabot Street or show that appellant was himself connected to the residence.</p>\n<p>The district court denied the motion to suppress, finding that the warrant affidavit had established probable cause. The court further found that even if there had not been probable cause to issue the warrant, the search was justified by the rule of <i>United States v. Leon,</i> 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), because a reasonable officer could have thought that the affidavit had established probable cause.</p>\n<p>Shortly before trial, appellant requested a hearing under <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> (1978), (a \"<i>Franks</i> hearing\") to contest allegedly false statements in the search warrant affidavit. The district court denied the motion, finding that defendant had failed to make the preliminary showing necessary to warrant a <i>Franks</i> hearing.</p>\n<p>A jury trial commenced on October 16, 2006 and lasted four days. The government presented the testimony of several law enforcement agents, including that of Trooper Long and others who had participated in the investigation and eventual search of 15 Cabot Street. The government's final witness was Massachusetts State Police Officer Dean Levangie. Officer Levangie had participated in well over 300 crack cocaine investigations, an estimated seventy percent of which had occurred in Brockton, and testified as an expert in Brockton narcotics investigations.</p>\n<p>After the district court's rejection of appellant's motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, appellant presented the testimony of his mother, Rosemarie Hicks. The thrust of appellant's defense was that he lived with his parents and was only an occasional guest at 15 Cabot Street, that the drugs and paraphernalia found at the residence did not belong to him, and that he had no intent to exercise control over or distribute the drugs. At the close of evidence, he did not renew his Rule 29 motion. The jury found him guilty of all three counts. He was subsequently sentenced to 360 months of imprisonment for each of the three counts, to be served concurrently, followed by an eight-year term of supervised release. Appellant filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized in the search of 15 Cabot Street because the application in support of the search warrant failed to establish probable cause. We employ a two-tiered standard of review to analyze such claims. Questions of law, including the question of whether a given set of facts gives rise to probable cause, are reviewed de novo, <i>United States v. Woodbury,</i> 511 F.3d 93, 96 (1st Cir.2007), while factual findings are reviewed for clear error, <i>United States v. Ribeiro,</i> 397 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.2005). We \"give significant deference to the magistrate judge's initial evaluation,\" and reverse \"only if we see no `substantial basis' for concluding that probable cause existed.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p>A search warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to believe that: 1) a crime has been committed, and 2) \"enumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place to be searched the so-called `nexus' element.\" <i>Id.</i> In considering whether a warrant affidavit establishes probable cause, a magistrate judge's task is \"`to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him ... there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.'\" <i>Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d at 86 (modification in original) (quoting <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)).</p>\n<p>Appellant argues that the warrant affidavit was faulty because it failed to establish probable cause to believe that there was a nexus between the controlled purchases and 15 Cabot Street, and that the evidence found at the home should therefore have been suppressed. We disagree. Trooper Long's warrant affidavit supplied a host of evidence to establish a \"fair probability\" that evidence of the narcotics <span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> trade would be found at 15 Cabot Street.</p>\n<p>According to the affidavit, the CI gave Officer Long the crack cocaine after each controlled purchase and stated that it had been purchased from \"Pudgie.\" The affidavit also described reliable information provided by the CI in earlier investigations and stated that Long knew \"Pudgie\" to be the nickname of appellant, who had several prior convictions for drug distribution offenses. The affidavit stated that officers followed a black Mazda van directly to 15 Cabot Street after its driver, reported by the CI to be \"Pudgie,\" had used the van to deliver drugs during a controlled purchase. Officers later observed the van parked at the home during the late evening and early morning hours. Utilities at 15 Cabot Street were in appellant's name.</p>\n<p>Trooper Long and other officers' knowledge and experience with 15 Cabot Street also linked appellant to the residence. The cell phone number dialed by the CI to reach \"Pudgie\" was registered to Edward Robinson, who had previously sold crack cocaine to law enforcement officers and had been arrested after an earlier investigation and search of 15 Cabot Street. Robinson was connected to appellant because during the earlier investigation he had used a vehicle registered to appellant's father to deliver drugs. Furthermore, 15 Cabot Street was owned by Renee Yarrell, who was known by officers to be appellant's girlfriend and who had also sold drugs to undercover officers during the earlier investigation of 15 Cabot Street. Finally, the search warrant affidavit detailed Trooper Long's experience and training in narcotics investigations and his belief that 15 Cabot Street would contain evidence of appellant's preparation and distribution of narcotics.</p>\n<p>In <i>Ribeiro,</i> 397 F.3d at 49-50, we found that the nexus element was satisfied when police officers conducting surveillance had seen the defendant leaving his home shortly before participating in a controlled narcotics purchase. Analyzing whether there was probable cause to establish the nexus requirement, we found it \"compelling\" that the defendant had been able to quickly respond to the undercover officer's requests for narcotics, which indicated that he kept a readily accessible supply of narcotics. <i>Id.</i> at 50. The nexus requirement was also supported by information obtained through surveillance and by the affiant officer's averment that he knew drug traffickers frequently stored drugs, cash, and other evidence of the drug trade in their homes. <i>Id.</i> at 51-52.</p>\n<p>As in <i>Ribeiro,</i> the circumstances set forth in the affidavitwhich included the surveillance information, appellant's prior convictions and his connections to known drug dealers who operated out of 15 Cabot Street, and observations drawn from Trooper Long's training and experience established a fair probability that appellant lived at 15 Cabot Street and that evidence of his drug dealing would be found there. Because we agree with the magistrate judge's determination that probable cause existed to search 15 Cabot Street, we affirm the district court's denial of appellant's motion to suppress the fruits of the search.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> hearing to contest the veracity of statements made by Trooper Long in the warrant affidavit. Under <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 155, 98 S.Ct. 2674, a defendant may request an evidentiary hearing to challenge the truthfulness of statements made by law enforcement agents in a search warrant affidavit. To obtain a <i>Franks</i> hearing, a defendant must make \"a substantial preliminary showing\" that: 1) the warrant affidavit contains a false statement made \"knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth,\" <i>id.</i> at 155-56, and 2) that \"the allegedly false statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause.\" <i>Id.</i> at 156, 98 S.Ct. 2674. We review the denial of a <i>Franks</i> hearing for clear error, <i>United States v. Materas,</i> 483 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2007), which exists only when we are \"`left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.'\" <i>United States v. Castillo,</i> 287 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Anderson v. City of Bessemer,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n<p>In his motion for a <i>Franks</i> hearing, appellant challenged the veracity of Trooper Long's statement that the second controlled purchase happened \"on or about\" January 16, 2005. The district court denied the motion, finding that appellant had failed to make the necessary preliminary showing that the warrant contained a false statement made knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth, and that, even if the challenged statement were false, it was not necessary to the finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p>Appellant emphasizes on appeal, as he did in the district court, that the warrant states that the second controlled purchase occurred \"on or about\" January 16, 2005, while Trooper Long's work records show that he did not work January 15, 16, or 17. Appellant finds this possible discrepancy a sufficient showing that Trooper long knowingly included a falsehood in the affidavit.</p>\n<p>As the government points out, the use of the phrase \"on or about\" when describing the time frame of a controlled drug purchase is a common police practice, used to protect the identity of a confidential informant. In <i>United States v. Carty,</i> 993 F.2d 1005, 1007 (1st Cir.1992), we found that there was \"nothing inherently contradictory or incredible\" in the affiant's assertion that a controlled purchase had occurred \"within the past few days\" of a warrant's execution, when the purchase had actually occurred the day of the execution. <i>Id.</i> at 1008. We remarked that the description's vagueness was due to the common police practice of not stating precisely the time of the buy in order to protect the confidentiality of the informant. <i>Id.; see also United States v. Davis,</i> 1996 WL 521202, at *6 (1st Cir. Sept.16, 1996) (\"While further detail about the controlled buy might have been desirable, the lack of specificity about the date of the buy or the quantity involved is not necessarily probative of falsity. The concern for keeping the buyer's identify confidential is a more likely explanation for the lack of those details.\"). As in <i>Carty,</i> there is \"nothing inherently contradictory\" in Trooper Long's description of the date of the controlled purchase: the fact that the buy may not have occurred within one day of the date referenced in Trooper Long's affidavit simply does not mean that it did not occur \"about\" that date.</p>\n<p>Further, even if appellant could show that Trooper Long made a knowingly false statement, he has not shown that the challenged statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause. \"[T]o determine the sufficiency of the affidavit, excluding the contested sentence, we look to `whether the totality of the circumstances stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> cause to search either the premises or the person.'\" <i>United States v. Barnes,</i> 492 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir.1997)). Even if the exact dates had not been set forth in the affidavit at all, the \"totality of the circumstances\" stated in the warrant affidavit was more than sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found at 15 Cabot Street.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of defendant's motion for a <i>Franks</i> hearing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's verdict and the district court's denial of his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts.<sup>[2]</sup> We normally review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the denial of Rule 29 motions by asking whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Thompson,</i> 449 F.3d 267, 275 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.1998) (challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and Rule 29 motions present a single issue for review). Because appellant failed to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence, however, we will reverse his convictions \"only if the verdict threatens to work a clear and gross injustice.\" <i>United States v. Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d 302, 309 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Cocaine Charges</h2>\n<p>We begin with the drug charges. 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) makes it illegal to distribute or possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Because appellant did not possess the cocaine on his person at the time of the search, the government relied on a theory of constructive possession, which \"`exists when a person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object either directly or through others.'\" <i>United States v. García-Carrasquillo,</i> 483 F.3d 124, 130 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 501 (1st Cir.2005)). Such possession \"can be joint, does not require actual ownership ... and can be established through circumstantial evidence, though `mere presence or association with another who possessed the contraband is insufficient.'\" <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 67 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Wight,</i> 968 F.2d 1393, 1397 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p>Defendant argues, in the main, that he was only at 15 Cabot Street on the day of the search because he was babysitting Yarrell's children and that he was not involved with the narcotics trade being run out of the home. He points out that he was not linked to the drugs through physical possession or evidence such as fingerprints. That is true. Nevertheless, other circumstantial evidence permitted a reasonable jury to conclude that appellant lived at 15 Cabot Street, knew of the drugs' existence, had the power and intention <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> to exercise control over them, and had the intention to distribute them.</p>\n<p>Cable, electricity, and telephone bills for service at 15 Cabot Street were in appellant's name. Inside the home, officers found a personal letter addressed to appellant at 15 Cabot Street as well as his student loan statement. Moreover, when the officers executing the warrant entered the home, they saw appellant sitting on the edge of the bed in the master bedroom, wrapped in a damp towel as if he had just showered. Inside the bedroom was a photograph of appellant and his girlfriend, Yarrell, who owned the house. Men's clothes were on the bedroom floor and inside the bedroom closet. In the drawer of the night stand there was a cell phone registered to appellant, a men's watch, and cash.</p>\n<p>Evidence of the drug tradesuch as digital scales, plastic baggies, baking soda, and large amounts of cashwas scattered throughout the home. There was evidence of appellant's prior involvement with the distribution of cocaine, indicating his familiarity with these items. Officer Levangie testified that, in addition to drugs themselves, plastic bags, scales, and money were among the items he had frequently seen and seized during drug searches in Brockton, and that he had seen baking soda used by Brockton drug dealers as a cutting agent. The government also introduced into evidence a recording of a collect call appellant had made to Yarrell while he was in a Massachusetts jail approximately one year prior to the search. On the call, appellant told Yarrell how to package and sell cocaine at 15 Cabot Street. This evidence directly contradicted appellant's theory that he was an innocent bystander to the drug trade happening within Yarrell's home.</p>\n<p>Further, $2,090 in cash was found in the pocket of a men's jacket inside the bedroom where appellant was sitting at the inception of the search. Officer Levangie testified that Brockton drug dealers tend to keep large amounts of cash on hand and readily available; appellant was the nearest person to the cash and the only adult in the home. Officer Levangie also testified that drug dealers often change their telephone numbers and make frequent phone calls. The cell phone found in the drawer was registered to appellant, had been activated just two days before, and had already been used to make 161 phone calls. Finally, Officer Levangie opined that the cocaine seized from 15 Cabot Street had a street value in excess of $12,000, a quantity consistent with narcotics dealing rather than personal use.</p>\n<p>Taking this evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, we find that a reasonable jury could convict appellant for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Failing to meet our regular standard of review for Rule 29 and evidentiary sufficiency challenges, appellant necessarily also fails to meet the more stringent \"clear and gross injustice\" standard. <i>See </i><i>Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d at 309.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Ammunition Charge</h2>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) makes it illegal for \"any personwho has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition....\" Such possession may be constructive. <i>DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d at 67. The government introduced uncontroverted evidence that the appellant is a convicted felon and that the ammunition found in the night stand had traveled through interstate commerce. It also introduced evidence sufficient to establish constructive possession of the bullets. The ammunition was located in a drawer next to appellant's cellular telephone, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> a men's watch, a key, and cash, and was within arm's reach of appellant when the officers entered the bedroom. Furthermore, the cellular telephone lying next to the bullets had been used to make a phone call thirty minutes before the search. Finally, Officer Levangie testified that it was \"common practice\" for Brockton drug dealers to hide weapons or pass them off to \"co-workers,\" providing an explanation for why appellant would possess ammunition although he was not found to be in possession of a gun. A rational jury could have found that appellant had the requisite \"power and intention ... to exercise dominion and control\" over the items in the drawer, including the ammunition. <i>McLean,</i> 409 F.3d at 501.</p>\n<p>As with the drug charges, we find no \"clear and gross injustice\" in the district court's denial of appellant's Rule 29 motion on the weapons charge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>Appellant objects to the admission of certain \"prior act\" evidence at trial. Before trial, the government notified the court and defense counsel that it intended to introduce evidence that the defendant had three prior cocaine-related convictions in Massachusetts state court: two for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and one for distribution of cocaine. It also sought permission to admit into evidence the recording of a telephone call made by appellant from a Massachusetts jail approximately one year before the incidents leading to Trooper Long's search of 15 Cabot Street. On the collect phone call, which appellant was warned would be recorded, appellant gave his girlfriend, Yarrell, instructions on how to package and sell cocaine stashed at 15 Cabot Street and inquired about the finances of his narcotics operation.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The government argued that the prior convictions and the telephone call were relevant to show the defendant's knowledge of the cocaine in the home and his intent to distribute the cocaine and, as such, should not be excluded by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)'s prohibition against prior bad act evidence.<sup>[4]</sup> The district court agreed, admitting the convictions as relevant to the defendant's knowledge and intent.<sup>[5]</sup> The court reserved its ruling on the phone call, but at trial determined that it was also admissible. We review a district court's determination about whether to exclude evidence under Rule 404(b) or 403 for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Tse,</i> 375 F.3d 148, 155 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), evidence of prior bad acts is not admissible to show the actor's bad character or propensity to commit crime. <i>United States v. Arias-Montoya,</i> 967 F.2d 708, 709 (1st Cir.1992). \"While logically relevant, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> `propensity' or `bad character' evidence is deemed to carry an unacceptable risk that the jury will convict the defendant for crimes other than those charged,\" <i>id.,</i> or simply because \"a bad person deserves punishment,\" <i>United States v. Moccia,</i> 681 F.2d 61, 63 (1st Cir.1982). Prior act evidence, however, is admissible for any other relevant purpose, such as to show \"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, [or] plan ...\" Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).</p>\n<p>This circuit imposes a two-part test to determine whether prior act evidence is admissible. <i>United States v. Whitney,</i> 524 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir.2008). First, a court must ask whether the proffered evidence has a \"special\" relevance, i.e., a non-propensity relevance. <i>Id.</i> Next, the court must determine whether the evidence should be excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, which allows courts to exclude relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p>Here, the challenged evidence passed the first prong of the test because of its \"special\" relevance to appellant's defense that he was innocently in the home to babysit the children at the time of the search. A person with previous convictions for possession with intent to distribute crack and powder cocaine would have been more likely to recognize the drug trade paraphernalia that was scattered about the home, such as baking powder, plastic baggies, digital scales, and cash. <i>See </i><i>Moccia,</i> 681 F.2d at 63 (prior marijuana conviction admissible to support the government's theory that \"one who lives on a farm with marijuana in the freezer room and under the chicken coop and has a prior possession conviction is more likely to know about the presence of marijuana than one who lives on such a farm and does not have a past possession conviction.\"). The prior convictions were also relevant to the issue of appellant's intent to exercise control over the drugs in the home. The recorded phone call was similarly relevant to appellant's knowledge of the accouterments of the drug trade in the home and his intent to exercise control over the drugs.</p>\n<p>Because the prior act evidence had special relevance, we must next ask whether the evidence should have been excluded under Rule 403 because its probative value was \"substantially outweighed\" by its danger of unfair prejudice. Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>Whitney,</i> 524 F.3d at 141. Even though the writer of this opinion is concerned about the \"piling on\" of multiple criminal convictions when a lesser number might suffice to establish the proposition of concern to the government, a majority of the panel does not believe that the district judge abused his discretion in this instance, taking the view as well that the piling on argument was not even properly made in the district court or advanced in this form on appeal.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*143</span> We review non-constitutional evidentiary errors for harmlessness; an error is harmless if it is \"highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Roberson,</i> 459 F.3d 39, 49 (1st Cir.2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Even if there was an error in the admission of the three prior felony convictions (and a majority of the panel does not suggest that there was), that error was harmless in light of the other overwhelming evidence against appellant, which included the copious drug paraphernalia in the home where he resided, the cell phone records that fit the pattern of a drug dealer, and the ammunition and cash found in his possession. <i>See supra</i> Part IV.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI.</h2>\n<p>Appellant challenges the admission of the jail call to Yarrell on a different ground, arguing that the admission of Yarrell's recorded statements violated his Sixth Amendment rights as articulated by the Supreme Court in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Under <i>Crawford,</i> \"a declarant's `testimonial' out-of-court statement is not admissible under the Confrontation Clause unless (1) the declarant testifies, or (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination and the declarant is unavailable, or (3) the evidence is admitted for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\" <i>United States v. Maher,</i> 454 F.3d 13, 19-20 (1st Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Yarrell's statements were not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted but rather to provide context for appellants' statements, and thus did not violate the Confrontation Clause. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Walter,</i> 434 F.3d 30, 33-34 (1st Cir.2006) (recorded statements of a non-testifying informant were admissible to show context of defendant's conversation with informant). During the phone conversation, appellant inquired about the status of money and drugs left with Yarrell. For example, the following exchanges were recorded:</p>\n<blockquote>Hicks: I left you with three two-and-a-halfs, I mean, two-and-a-quarter, whatever, and I left you with three two-and-a-quarters. There was three sets of dimes. Am I right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Yarrell: Yup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Hicks: That's almost $17,000 worth of shit, $16,000 ... Now, plus I left you with almost seven Gs in cash, if I'm not mistaken, like 65, we'll say 65 even though it was more than 65. It was</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Yarrell: No. It was 66.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Hicks: All right, 6,600, so almost seven Gs in cash. Now, you're telling me you got like two Gs worth of stuff left and the other powder stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Hicks: I know for a fact I left you with almost eight things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> Yarrell: with what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Hicks: Well, six. Let's say six things, not including the raw food because the raw food is like two things alone so let's say six ... What ... you been doing with my money?</blockquote>\n<p>The statements made by Yarrell, little more than brief responses to Hicks's much more detailed statements, were unquestionably admitted to provide context for the statements of appellant. Because they were not entered for the truth of the matter asserted, they did not implicate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII.</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the trial court improperly admitted Officer Levangie's expert testimony about the use of firearms by Brockton drug dealers. We review this challenge to the admission of expert testimony for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Giambro,</i> 544 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Characterizing Officer Levangie's testimony as \"profiling\" testimony, appellant argues that it was improper expert testimony that invaded the fact-finding function of the jury. Specifically, he objects to Officer Levangie's testimony that weapons are prevalent among drug dealers in Brockton and that it is \"common practice\" for weapons to be hidden or passed off between dealers and \"co-workers\" who sell drugs for them.</p>\n<p>This testimony was directly relevant to appellant's argument, suggested during cross examination and repeated in closing argument, that he was not linked to the bullets because he was not found in possession of a gun. Officer Levangie, who has extensive experience investigating narcotics dealers in Brockton, was well qualified to explain why appellant was found with ammunition and not a firearm. That was a proper subject of expert testimony because it \"assist[ed] the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Fed.R.Evid. 702.<sup>[7]</sup> The average juror might not understand the fluid exchange of weapons among drug dealers in Brockton and thus might find it odd that a drug dealer would possess ammunition but no weapon.</p>\n<p>In <i>United States v.

We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's admission of Officer Levangie's testimony about the prevalence and use of firearms among drug dealers in Brockton.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VIII.</h2>\n<p>Finally, appellant objects to his sentence, claiming that his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated because the prior convictions that made him eligible to be sentenced as an armed career criminal, 18 U.S.C. § 924, and a career offender, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court has stated that the question of whether a defendant has a predicate conviction \"is exempt from the general rule that a jury must find any fact that raises a sentence above the statutorily-prescribed maximum.\" <i>United States v. Duval,</i> 496 F.3d 64, 80 (1st Cir. 2007) (describing <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)). Bound by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> this precedent, we reject appellant's Sixth Amendment challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The government argues, alternatively, that even if there were no probable cause for the search warrant, the evidence should not have been suppressed because of the good-faith exception of <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 913, 104 S.Ct. 3405. Because we find that probable cause existed, we need not reach that alternative argument. <i>See </i><i>Ribeiro,</i> 397 F.3d at 52 n. 7.</p>\n<p>[2]  In parts V and VI of this opinion, we address the admissibility of certain evidence. Often, in criminal cases involving challenges to both the admissibility of certain evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence to support convictions, we will address the admissibility issues first to determine which evidence is appropriately considered in the sufficiency of the evidence analysis. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Avilés-Colón,</i> 536 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2008). We choose a different sequence here because the sufficiency of the evidence analysis helps to illuminate the discussion of the admissibility issues in parts V and VI.</p>\n<p>[3]  The statements in the telephone calls were not hearsay because they were \"admission[s] by a party-opponent.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2); <i>see id.</i> (admissions are, <i>inter alia,</i> statements offered against a party that are \"the party's own statement\"); 2 Kenneth S. Brown, <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 254 (6th ed. 2006) (\"Admissions are simply words or actions inconsistent with the party's position at trial, relevant to the substantive issues in the case, and offered against the party.\"). Because the statements described appellant's own prior bad acts, Rule 404(b) was implicated and the appropriateness of admitting the testimony was evaluated under that rule.</p>\n<p>[4]  The government did not seek to admit the convictions for the purpose of impeaching the defendant, who did not testify. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 609(a).</p>\n<p>[5]  The district court also noted that evidence of one prior felony conviction was necessary to establish the felon element of the § 922(g)(1) charge.</p>\n<p>[6]  Unlike my colleagues, I conclude that there was an abuse of discretion in the district court's admission of appellant's three prior felony convictions and that the issue was properly raised below and on appeal. Therefore, I would have preferred to address the admissibility issue directly and thereby give some content to our oft-stated but unhelpful caution that the government and the district court should \"be careful as to the admission of extrinsic act evidence under Rule 404(b).\" <i>Arias-Montoya,</i> 967 F.2d at 713 (quotations and modifications omitted); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

Here, the admission of the telephone recording and one of the prior convictions was appropriate, given appellant's claim that he was innocently at 15 Cabot Street. However, the probative value of the other two cocaine convictions was \"substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice ... [and the] needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Fed. R.Evid. 403. The evidence of the phone call, which was powerfully inculpatory, and a single prior drug conviction would have allowed the government to challenge appellant's claim of innocence without incurring the risk at the heart of Rule 404the danger that \"a jury will convict for crimes other than those chargedor that, uncertain of guilt, it will convict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment....\" <i>Moccia,</i> 681 F.2d at 63. Here the government incurred that risk by pressing for the admission of all three convictions.

We reject appellant's claims of error and affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On January 20, 2005, agents of the Massachusetts State Police conducted a search of 15 Cabot Street in Brockton, Massachusetts pursuant to a \"no-knock\" search warrant issued earlier that day by a magistrate judge. Massachusetts State Trooper James Long, who had been investigating appellant for weeks prior to the search, had executed an affidavit in support of the search warrant.</p>\n<p>Long's affidavit stated that in December 2004, a confidential informant (CI) told him that he or she had been purchasing crack cocaine from a man known as \"Pudgie.\" The CI identified appellant as \"Pudgie\" in a photograph. The affidavit stated that the CI then participated in two controlled purchases of crack cocaine from appellant. The first transaction occurred \"on or about\" January 7, 2005 and the second \"on or about\" January 16, 2005. The affidavit explained that Long and other officers working the case were familiar with 15 Cabot Street from a previous narcotics investigation that had resulted in a search of the residence in January 2004. Officer Long averred in the affidavit that he believed that 15 Cabot Street was a location maintained by Hicks to prepare and distribute drugs.</p>\n<p>The search was executed by a team of law enforcement officers. They found appellant in a bedroom, sitting on the edge of a bed and wearing nothing but a towel. He was the only adult in the house. In the drawer of a night stand and within arm's reach of where appellant had been sitting on the bed, the officers discovered a cellular telephone, a box of ammunition, a weapon holster, a men's watch, a key, and cash. They also found $2,090 in cash in the pocket of a leather jacket hanging in the closet. In the basement of the home, the officers found a digital scale, plastic baggies, baking soda, and, inside the hollow legs of a weight bench, 20.89 grams of crack cocaine and 125.51 grams of powder cocaine. In the kitchen, the officers found two more digital scales. Hicks was arrested and subsequently charged with being a felon in possession of ammunition and possession with intent to distribute crack and powder cocaine.</p>\n<p>In March 2006, appellant moved in the district court to suppress the evidence seized during the search of 15 Cabot Street, claiming that the search warrant had been defective. Specifically, he argued that Trooper Long's affidavit did not establish probable cause to believe that evidence of narcotics dealing would be found at 15 Cabot Street. He claimed that Long's affidavit did not connect the CI's controlled purchases to 15 Cabot Street or show that appellant was himself connected to the residence.</p>\n<p>The district court denied the motion to suppress, finding that the warrant affidavit had established probable cause. The court further found that even if there had not been probable cause to issue the warrant, the search was justified by the rule of <i>United States v. Leon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span> (1984), because a reasonable officer could have thought that the affidavit had established probable cause.</p>\n<p>Shortly before trial, appellant requested a hearing under <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court denied the motion, finding that defendant had failed to make the preliminary showing necessary to warrant a <i>Franks</i> hearing.</p>\n<p>A jury trial commenced on October 16, 2006 and lasted four days. The government presented the testimony of several law enforcement agents, including that of Trooper Long and others who had participated in the investigation and eventual search of 15 Cabot Street. The government's final witness was Massachusetts State Police Officer Dean Levangie. Officer Levangie had participated in well over 300 crack cocaine investigations, an estimated seventy percent of which had occurred in Brockton, and testified as an expert in Brockton narcotics investigations.</p>\n<p>After the district court's rejection of appellant's motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, appellant presented the testimony of his mother, Rosemarie Hicks. The thrust of appellant's defense was that he lived with his parents and was only an occasional guest at 15 Cabot Street, that the drugs and paraphernalia found at the residence did not belong to him, and that he had no intent to exercise control over or distribute the drugs. At the close of evidence, he did not renew his Rule 29 motion. The jury found him guilty of all three counts. He was subsequently sentenced to 360 months of imprisonment for each of the three counts, to be served concurrently, followed by an eight-year term of supervised release. Appellant filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized in the search of 15 Cabot Street because the application in support of the search warrant failed to establish probable cause. We employ a two-tiered standard of review to analyze such claims. Questions of law, including the question of whether a given set of facts gives rise to probable cause, are reviewed de novo, <i>United States v. Woodbury,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203089\"><a href=\"/opinion/203089/united-states-v-woodbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 96 (1st Cir.2007), while factual findings are reviewed for clear error, <i>United States v.

We \"give significant deference to the magistrate judge's initial evaluation,\" and reverse \"only if we see no `substantial basis' for concluding that probable cause existed.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Feliz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764988\"><a href=\"/opinion/764988/united-states-v-yanokura-f-eliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p>A search warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to believe that: 1) a crime has been committed, and 2) \"enumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place to be searched the so-called `nexus' element.\" <i>Id.</i> In considering whether a warrant affidavit establishes probable cause, a magistrate judge's task is \"`to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him ... there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.'\" <i>Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d at 86 (modification in original) (quoting <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 238, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span> (1983)).</p>\n<p>Appellant argues that the warrant affidavit was faulty because it failed to establish probable cause to believe that there was a nexus between the controlled purchases and 15 Cabot Street, and that the evidence found at the home should therefore have been suppressed. We disagree. Trooper Long's warrant affidavit supplied a host of evidence to establish a \"fair probability\" that evidence of the narcotics <span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> trade would be found at 15 Cabot Street.</p>\n<p>According to the affidavit, the CI gave Officer Long the crack cocaine after each controlled purchase and stated that it had been purchased from \"Pudgie.\" The affidavit also described reliable information provided by the CI in earlier investigations and stated that Long knew \"Pudgie\" to be the nickname of appellant, who had several prior convictions for drug distribution offenses. The affidavit stated that officers followed a black Mazda van directly to 15 Cabot Street after its driver, reported by the CI to be \"Pudgie,\" had used the van to deliver drugs during a controlled purchase. Officers later observed the van parked at the home during the late evening and early morning hours. Utilities at 15 Cabot Street were in appellant's name.</p>\n<p>Trooper Long and other officers' knowledge and experience with 15 Cabot Street also linked appellant to the residence. The cell phone number dialed by the CI to reach \"Pudgie\" was registered to Edward Robinson, who had previously sold crack cocaine to law enforcement officers and had been arrested after an earlier investigation and search of 15 Cabot Street. Robinson was connected to appellant because during the earlier investigation he had used a vehicle registered to appellant's father to deliver drugs. Furthermore, 15 Cabot Street was owned by Renee Yarrell, who was known by officers to be appellant's girlfriend and who had also sold drugs to undercover officers during the earlier investigation of 15 Cabot Street. Finally, the search warrant affidavit detailed Trooper Long's experience and training in narcotics investigations and his belief that 15 Cabot Street would contain evidence of appellant's preparation and distribution of narcotics.</p>\n<p>In <i>Ribeiro,</i> 397 F.3d at 49-50, we found that the nexus element was satisfied when police officers conducting surveillance had seen the defendant leaving his home shortly before participating in a controlled narcotics purchase. Analyzing whether there was probable cause to establish the nexus requirement, we found it \"compelling\" that the defendant had been able to quickly respond to the undercover officer's requests for narcotics, which indicated that he kept a readily accessible supply of narcotics. <i>Id.</i> at 50. The nexus requirement was also supported by information obtained through surveillance and by the affiant officer's averment that he knew drug traffickers frequently stored drugs, cash, and other evidence of the drug trade in their homes. <i>Id.</i> at 51-52.</p>\n<p>As in <i>Ribeiro,</i> the circumstances set forth in the affidavitwhich included the surveillance information, appellant's prior convictions and his connections to known drug dealers who operated out of 15 Cabot Street, and observations drawn from Trooper Long's training and experience established a fair probability that appellant lived at 15 Cabot Street and that evidence of his drug dealing would be found there. Because we agree with the magistrate judge's determination that probable cause existed to search 15 Cabot Street, we affirm the district court's denial of appellant's motion to suppress the fruits of the search.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> hearing to contest the veracity of statements made by Trooper Long in the warrant affidavit. Under <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 155, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2674</span></a></span>, a defendant may request an evidentiary hearing to challenge the truthfulness of statements made by law enforcement agents in a search warrant affidavit. To obtain a <i>Franks</i> hearing, a defendant must make \"a substantial preliminary showing\" that: 1) the warrant affidavit contains a false statement made \"knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth,\" <i>id.</i> at 155-56, and 2) that \"the allegedly false statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause.\" <i>Id.</i> at 156, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court denied the motion, finding that appellant had failed to make the necessary preliminary showing that the warrant contained a false statement made knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth, and that, even if the challenged statement were false, it was not necessary to the finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p>Appellant emphasizes on appeal, as he did in the district court, that the warrant states that the second controlled purchase occurred \"on or about\" January 16, 2005, while Trooper Long's work records show that he did not work January 15, 16, or 17. Appellant finds this possible discrepancy a sufficient showing that Trooper long knowingly included a falsehood in the affidavit.</p>\n<p>As the government points out, the use of the phrase \"on or about\" when describing the time frame of a controlled drug purchase is a common police practice, used to protect the identity of a confidential informant. In <i>United States v. Carty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607110\"><a href=\"/opinion/607110/united-states-v-ralph-h-carty/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span>, 1007 (1st Cir.1992), we found that there was \"nothing inherently contradictory or incredible\" in the affiant's assertion that a controlled purchase had occurred \"within the past few days\" of a warrant's execution, when the purchase had actually occurred the day of the execution. <i>Id.</i> at 1008. We remarked that the description's vagueness was due to the common police practice of not stating precisely the time of the buy in order to protect the confidentiality of the informant. <i>Id.; see also United States v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">521202</span></span>, at *6 (1st Cir. Sept.16, 1996) (\"While further detail about the controlled buy might have been desirable, the lack of specificity about the date of the buy or the quantity involved is not necessarily probative of falsity. The concern for keeping the buyer's identify confidential is a more likely explanation for the lack of those details.\"). As in <i>Carty,</i> there is \"nothing inherently contradictory\" in Trooper Long's description of the date of the controlled purchase: the fact that the buy may not have occurred within one day of the date referenced in Trooper Long's affidavit simply does not mean that it did not occur \"about\" that date.</p>\n<p>Further, even if appellant could show that Trooper Long made a knowingly false statement, he has not shown that the challenged statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause. \"[T]o determine the sufficiency of the affidavit, excluding the contested sentence, we look to `whether the totality of the circumstances stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> cause to search either the premises or the person.'\" <i>United States v.

Even if the exact dates had not been set forth in the affidavit at all, the \"totality of the circumstances\" stated in the warrant affidavit was more than sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found at 15 Cabot Street.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of defendant's motion for a <i>Franks</i> hearing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's verdict and the district court's denial of his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts.<sup>[2]</sup> We normally review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the denial of Rule 29 motions by asking whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v.

The Cocaine Charges</h2>\n<p>We begin with the drug charges. 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) makes it illegal to distribute or possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Because appellant did not possess the cocaine on his person at the time of the search, the government relied on a theory of constructive possession, which \"`exists when a person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object either directly or through others.'\" <i>United States v.

DeCologero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203344\"><a href=\"/opinion/203344/united-states-v-decologero/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Wight,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586812\"><a href=\"/opinion/586812/united-states-v-phillip-a-wight/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1393</span></a></span>, 1397 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p>Defendant argues, in the main, that he was only at 15 Cabot Street on the day of the search because he was babysitting Yarrell's children and that he was not involved with the narcotics trade being run out of the home. He points out that he was not linked to the drugs through physical possession or evidence such as fingerprints. That is true. Nevertheless, other circumstantial evidence permitted a reasonable jury to conclude that appellant lived at 15 Cabot Street, knew of the drugs' existence, had the power and intention <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> to exercise control over them, and had the intention to distribute them.</p>\n<p>Cable, electricity, and telephone bills for service at 15 Cabot Street were in appellant's name. Inside the home, officers found a personal letter addressed to appellant at 15 Cabot Street as well as his student loan statement. Moreover, when the officers executing the warrant entered the home, they saw appellant sitting on the edge of the bed in the master bedroom, wrapped in a damp towel as if he had just showered. Inside the bedroom was a photograph of appellant and his girlfriend, Yarrell, who owned the house. Men's clothes were on the bedroom floor and inside the bedroom closet. In the drawer of the night stand there was a cell phone registered to appellant, a men's watch, and cash.</p>\n<p>Evidence of the drug tradesuch as digital scales, plastic baggies, baking soda, and large amounts of cashwas scattered throughout the home. There was evidence of appellant's prior involvement with the distribution of cocaine, indicating his familiarity with these items. Officer Levangie testified that, in addition to drugs themselves, plastic bags, scales, and money were among the items he had frequently seen and seized during drug searches in Brockton, and that he had seen baking soda used by Brockton drug dealers as a cutting agent. The government also introduced into evidence a recording of a collect call appellant had made to Yarrell while he was in a Massachusetts jail approximately one year prior to the search. On the call, appellant told Yarrell how to package and sell cocaine at 15 Cabot Street. This evidence directly contradicted appellant's theory that he was an innocent bystander to the drug trade happening within Yarrell's home.</p>\n<p>Further, $2,090 in cash was found in the pocket of a men's jacket inside the bedroom where appellant was sitting at the inception of the search. Officer Levangie testified that Brockton drug dealers tend to keep large amounts of cash on hand and readily available; appellant was the nearest person to the cash and the only adult in the home. Officer Levangie also testified that drug dealers often change their telephone numbers and make frequent phone calls. The cell phone found in the drawer was registered to appellant, had been activated just two days before, and had already been used to make 161 phone calls. Finally, Officer Levangie opined that the cocaine seized from 15 Cabot Street had a street value in excess of $12,000, a quantity consistent with narcotics dealing rather than personal use.</p>\n<p>Taking this evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, we find that a reasonable jury could convict appellant for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Failing to meet our regular standard of review for Rule 29 and evidentiary sufficiency challenges, appellant necessarily also fails to meet the more stringent \"clear and gross injustice\" standard. <i>See </i><i>Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d at 309.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Ammunition Charge</h2>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) makes it illegal for \"any personwho has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition....\" Such possession may be constructive. <i>DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d at 67. The government introduced uncontroverted evidence that the appellant is a convicted felon and that the ammunition found in the night stand had traveled through interstate commerce. It also introduced evidence sufficient to establish constructive possession of the bullets. The ammunition was located in a drawer next to appellant's cellular telephone, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> a men's watch, a key, and cash, and was within arm's reach of appellant when the officers entered the bedroom. Furthermore, the cellular telephone lying next to the bullets had been used to make a phone call thirty minutes before the search. Finally, Officer Levangie testified that it was \"common practice\" for Brockton drug dealers to hide weapons or pass them off to \"co-workers,\" providing an explanation for why appellant would possess ammunition although he was not found to be in possession of a gun. A rational jury could have found that appellant had the requisite \"power and intention ... to exercise dominion and control\" over the items in the drawer, including the ammunition. <i>McLean,</i> 409 F.3d at 501.</p>\n<p>As with the drug charges, we find no \"clear and gross injustice\" in the district court's denial of appellant's Rule 29 motion on the weapons charge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>Appellant objects to the admission of certain \"prior act\" evidence at trial. Before trial, the government notified the court and defense counsel that it intended to introduce evidence that the defendant had three prior cocaine-related convictions in Massachusetts state court: two for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and one for distribution of cocaine. It also sought permission to admit into evidence the recording of a telephone call made by appellant from a Massachusetts jail approximately one year before the incidents leading to Trooper Long's search of 15 Cabot Street. On the collect phone call, which appellant was warned would be recorded, appellant gave his girlfriend, Yarrell, instructions on how to package and sell cocaine stashed at 15 Cabot Street and inquired about the finances of his narcotics operation.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The government argued that the prior convictions and the telephone call were relevant to show the defendant's knowledge of the cocaine in the home and his intent to distribute the cocaine and, as such, should not be excluded by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)'s prohibition against prior bad act evidence.<sup>[4]</sup> The district court agreed, admitting the convictions as relevant to the defendant's knowledge and intent.<sup>[5]</sup> The court reserved its ruling on the phone call, but at trial determined that it was also admissible. We review a district court's determination about whether to exclude evidence under Rule 404(b) or 403 for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Tse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201143\"><a href=\"/opinion/201143/united-states-v-tse/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 155 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), evidence of prior bad acts is not admissible to show the actor's bad character or propensity to commit crime. <i>United States v. Arias-Montoya,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585782\"><a href=\"/opinion/585782/united-states-v-victor-arias-montoya/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 709 (1st Cir.1992). \"While logically relevant, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> `propensity' or `bad character' evidence is deemed to carry an unacceptable risk that the jury will convict the defendant for crimes other than those charged,\" <i>id.,</i> or simply because \"a bad person deserves punishment,\" <i>United States v. Moccia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405332\"><a href=\"/opinion/405332/united-states-v-nicholas-anthony-moccia/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.1982). Prior act evidence, however, is admissible for any other relevant purpose, such as to show \"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, [or] plan ...\" Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).</p>\n<p>This circuit imposes a two-part test to determine whether prior act evidence is admissible. <i>United States v. Whitney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203268\"><a href=\"/opinion/203268/united-states-v-whitney/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 141 (1st Cir.2008). First, a court must ask whether the proffered evidence has a \"special\" relevance, i.e., a non-propensity relevance. <i>Id.</i> Next, the court must determine whether the evidence should be excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, which allows courts to exclude relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p>Here, the challenged evidence passed the first prong of the test because of its \"special\" relevance to appellant's defense that he was innocently in the home to babysit the children at the time of the search. A person with previous convictions for possession with intent to distribute crack and powder cocaine would have been more likely to recognize the drug trade paraphernalia that was scattered about the home, such as baking powder, plastic baggies, digital scales, and cash. <i>See </i><i>Moccia,</i> 681 F.2d at 63 (prior marijuana conviction admissible to support the government's theory that \"one who lives on a farm with marijuana in the freezer room and under the chicken coop and has a prior possession conviction is more likely to know about the presence of marijuana than one who lives on such a farm and does not have a past possession conviction.\"). The prior convictions were also relevant to the issue of appellant's intent to exercise control over the drugs in the home. The recorded phone call was similarly relevant to appellant's knowledge of the accouterments of the drug trade in the home and his intent to exercise control over the drugs.</p>\n<p>Because the prior act evidence had special relevance, we must next ask whether the evidence should have been excluded under Rule 403 because its probative value was \"substantially outweighed\" by its danger of unfair prejudice. Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>Whitney,</i> 524 F.3d at 141. Even though the writer of this opinion is concerned about the \"piling on\" of multiple criminal convictions when a lesser number might suffice to establish the proposition of concern to the government, a majority of the panel does not believe that the district judge abused his discretion in this instance, taking the view as well that the piling on argument was not even properly made in the district court or advanced in this form on appeal.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*143</span> We review non-constitutional evidentiary errors for harmlessness; an error is harmless if it is \"highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Roberson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202345\"><a href=\"/opinion/202345/united-states-v-roberson/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Even if there was an error in the admission of the three prior felony convictions (and a majority of the panel does not suggest that there was), that error was harmless in light of the other overwhelming evidence against appellant, which included the copious drug paraphernalia in the home where he resided, the cell phone records that fit the pattern of a drug dealer, and the ammunition and cash found in his possession. <i>See supra</i> Part IV.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI.</h2>\n<p>Appellant challenges the admission of the jail call to Yarrell on a different ground, arguing that the admission of Yarrell's recorded statements violated his Sixth Amendment rights as articulated by the Supreme Court in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span> (2004). Under <i>Crawford,</i> \"a declarant's `testimonial' out-of-court statement is not admissible under the Confrontation Clause unless (1) the declarant testifies, or (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination and the declarant is unavailable, or (3) the evidence is admitted for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\" <i>United States v. Maher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202307\"><a href=\"/opinion/202307/united-states-v-maher/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1st Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Yarrell's statements were not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted but rather to provide context for appellants' statements, and thus did not violate the Confrontation Clause. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Walter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202006\"><a href=\"/opinion/202006/united-states-v-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 33-34 (1st Cir.2006) (recorded statements of a non-testifying informant were admissible to show context of defendant's conversation with informant). During the phone conversation, appellant inquired about the status of money and drugs left with Yarrell. For example, the following exchanges were recorded:</p>\n<blockquote>Hicks: I left you with three two-and-a-halfs, I mean, two-and-a-quarter, whatever, and I left you with three two-and-a-quarters. There was three sets of dimes. Am I right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Yarrell: Yup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Hicks: That's almost $17,000 worth of shit, $16,000 ... Now, plus I left you with almost seven Gs in cash, if I'm not mistaken, like 65, we'll say 65 even though it was more than 65. It was</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Yarrell: No. It was 66.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Hicks: All right, 6,600, so almost seven Gs in cash. Now, you're telling me you got like two Gs worth of stuff left and the other powder stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Hicks: I know for a fact I left you with almost eight things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> Yarrell: with what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Hicks: Well, six. Let's say six things, not including the raw food because the raw food is like two things alone so let's say six ... What ... you been doing with my money?</blockquote>\n<p>The statements made by Yarrell, little more than brief responses to Hicks's much more detailed statements, were unquestionably admitted to provide context for the statements of appellant. Because they were not entered for the truth of the matter asserted, they did not implicate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII.</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the trial court improperly admitted Officer Levangie's expert testimony about the use of firearms by Brockton drug dealers. We review this challenge to the admission of expert testimony for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Giambro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203507\"><a href=\"/opinion/203507/united-states-v-giambro/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Characterizing Officer Levangie's testimony as \"profiling\" testimony, appellant argues that it was improper expert testimony that invaded the fact-finding function of the jury. Specifically, he objects to Officer Levangie's testimony that weapons are prevalent among drug dealers in Brockton and that it is \"common practice\" for weapons to be hidden or passed off between dealers and \"co-workers\" who sell drugs for them.</p>\n<p>This testimony was directly relevant to appellant's argument, suggested during cross examination and repeated in closing argument, that he was not linked to the bullets because he was not found in possession of a gun. Officer Levangie, who has extensive experience investigating narcotics dealers in Brockton, was well qualified to explain why appellant was found with ammunition and not a firearm. That was a proper subject of expert testimony because it \"assist[ed] the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Fed.R.Evid. 702.<sup>[7]</sup> The average juror might not understand the fluid exchange of weapons among drug dealers in Brockton and thus might find it odd that a drug dealer would possess ammunition but no weapon.</p>\n<p>In <i>United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199833\"><a href=\"/opinion/199833/united-states-v-lopez-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14-15 (1st Cir.2002), we explained that expert testimony was properly admitted to explain how Puerto Rican drug dealers use Global Positioning Systems to facilitate air drops and cellular telephones to enable communication among boatssubjects similarly unfamiliar to the average juror. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's admission of Officer Levangie's testimony about the prevalence and use of firearms among drug dealers in Brockton.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VIII.</h2>\n<p>Finally, appellant objects to his sentence, claiming that his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated because the prior convictions that made him eligible to be sentenced as an armed career criminal, 18 U.S.C. § 924, and a career offender, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court has stated that the question of whether a defendant has a predicate conviction \"is exempt from the general rule that a jury must find any fact that raises a sentence above the statutorily-prescribed maximum.\" <i>United States v. Duval,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202877\"><a href=\"/opinion/202877/united-states-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir. 2007) (describing <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 247, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span> (1998)). Bound by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> this precedent, we reject appellant's Sixth Amendment challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The government argues, alternatively, that even if there were no probable cause for the search warrant, the evidence should not have been suppressed because of the good-faith exception of <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 913, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3405</span></a></span>. Because we find that probable cause existed, we need not reach that alternative argument. <i>See </i><i>Ribeiro,</i> 397 F.3d at 52 n. 7.</p>\n<p>[2]  In parts V and VI of this opinion, we address the admissibility of certain evidence. Often, in criminal cases involving challenges to both the admissibility of certain evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence to support convictions, we will address the admissibility issues first to determine which evidence is appropriately considered in the sufficiency of the evidence analysis. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Avilés-Colón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203414\"><a href=\"/opinion/203414/united-states-v-aviles-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2008). We choose a different sequence here because the sufficiency of the evidence analysis helps to illuminate the discussion of the admissibility issues in parts V and VI.</p>\n<p>[3]  The statements in the telephone calls were not hearsay because they were \"admission[s] by a party-opponent.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2); <i>see id.</i> (admissions are, <i>inter alia,</i> statements offered against a party that are \"the party's own statement\"); 2 Kenneth S. Brown, <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 254 (6th ed. 2006) (\"Admissions are simply words or actions inconsistent with the party's position at trial, relevant to the substantive issues in the case, and offered against the party.\"). Because the statements described appellant's own prior bad acts, Rule 404(b) was implicated and the appropriateness of admitting the testimony was evaluated under that rule.</p>\n<p>[4]  The government did not seek to admit the convictions for the purpose of impeaching the defendant, who did not testify. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 609(a).</p>\n<p>[5]  The district court also noted that evidence of one prior felony conviction was necessary to establish the felon element of the § 922(g)(1) charge.</p>\n<p>[6]  Unlike my colleagues, I conclude that there was an abuse of discretion in the district court's admission of appellant's three prior felony convictions and that the issue was properly raised below and on appeal. Therefore, I would have preferred to address the admissibility issue directly and thereby give some content to our oft-stated but unhelpful caution that the government and the district court should \"be careful as to the admission of extrinsic act evidence under Rule 404(b).\" <i>Arias-Montoya,</i> 967 F.2d at 713 (quotations and modifications omitted); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Garcia-Rosa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524260\"><a href=\"/opinion/524260/united-states-v-blanca-garcia-rosa-united-states-of-america-v-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, 221 (1st Cir.1989); <i>United States v. Flores Pérez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507350\"><a href=\"/opinion/507350/united-states-v-francisco-flores-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1988). Here, the admission of the telephone recording and one of the prior convictions was appropriate, given appellant's claim that he was innocently at 15 Cabot Street. However, the probative value of the other two cocaine convictions was \"substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice ... [and the] needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Fed. R.Evid. 403. The evidence of the phone call, which was powerfully inculpatory, and a single prior drug conviction would have allowed the government to challenge appellant's claim of innocence without incurring the risk at the heart of Rule 404the danger that \"a jury will convict for crimes other than those chargedor that, uncertain of guilt, it will convict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment....\" <i>Moccia,</i> 681 F.2d at 63. Here the government incurred that risk by pressing for the admission of all three convictions. Fortunately for the government, however, the resulting error was harmless.</p>\n<p>[7]  Appellant does not object to Officer Levangie's qualification as an expert witness.</p>\n\n</div>",
