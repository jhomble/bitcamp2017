This diversity case involves a\n\ndispute between Riso, Inc.--a distributor of digital duplicating\n\nmachines and related parts and supplies--and its insurer GAIC,1 as\n\nto whether GAIC had duties to defend and indemnify Riso in an\n\nantitrust suit filed against Riso by several California school\n\ndistricts, Modesto City Schs. v. Riso Kagaku Corp., No. Civ. S-99-\n\n2214 (E.D. Cal., filed Nov. 5, 1999).   The factual background is\n\neasy to recount; the legal issue is more difficult.\n\n          The Modesto complaint alleged that Riso had engaged in\n\nunlawful restraint of trade to ensure that owners of Riso machines-\n\n-such as the school districts--would use only Riso supplies and\n\nservice providers. The means included refusing to sell replacement\n\nparts to independent service providers, territorial restraints on\n\nits own dealers, tying machine sales to use of Riso parts, and\n\ndisparaging competitors in the supplies market as \"supply pirates\"\n\nwhose products could \"cause serious damage\"–-not covered by Riso's\n\nwarranty--to the machine.\n\n          Riso was protected during the period pertinent to the\n\nModesto suit by primary and umbrella commercial general liability\n\npolicies issued to it by GAIC between 1991 and 2000.   The policies\n\nprovided that GAIC would \"pay those sums that [Riso] becomes\n\n\n\n     1\n      We use \"GAIC\" to refer collectively to Great American\nInsurance Company, Great American Insurance Company of New York,\nGreat American Assurance Company, and Great American Alliance\nInsurance Company.\n\n                                 -2-\n\flegally obligated to pay as damages because of 'personal injury'\n\n. . . to which this insurance applies\" and that GAIC had \"the right\n\nand duty to defend [Riso] against any 'suit' seeking those damages\n\nfor 'personal injury.'\"\n\n              When the Modesto complaint was filed, Riso gave notice of\n\nthe suit to GAIC, asserting coverage under these policies.                It\n\nrelied   on    the   allegations   of    disparagement   in   the   antitrust\n\ncomplaint as triggering the \"personal injury\" coverage of its GAIC\n\npolicies. The policies defined \"personal injury\" as \"injury, other\n\nthan 'bodily injury,' arising out of one or more of the following\n\noffenses,\" namely, malicious prosecution, false arrest, wrongful\n\neviction, invasion of privacy, and--pertinent here--\n\n                     d. [O]ral or written publication         of\n              material that slanders or libels a person       or\n              organization or disparages a person's           or\n              organization's     goods,    products           or\n              services . . . .\n\n              GAIC refused to defend and the Modesto suit settled in\n\nNovember 2003. In October 2004, Riso sought a declaratory judgment\n\nin Massachusetts state court that GAIC had been obligated to defend\n\nand indemnify Riso in connection with the Modesto suit.                 GAIC\n\ncountered with a declaratory judgment action in federal court and\n\nremoved Riso's suit.       The parties cross-moved, Riso for partial\n\nsummary judgment that GAIC had a duty to defend, and GAIC for\n\nsummary judgment that it had no duty to defend or indemnify.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            In March 2006, the district court denied Riso's motion\n\nand granted GAIC's motion.         The court reasoned that the policy\n\ncovered only suits alleging the tort of product disparagement, and\n\nthat   GAIC    therefore   had   no   duty    to    defend   suits   alleging\n\ndisparagement of parties other than the underlying plaintiffs.\n\nAlternatively it said that the Modesto plaintiffs' injuries did not\n\n\"arise   out   of\"   Riso's   disparagement    of    competitors'    products\n\nbecause the disparagement did not \"materially contribute\" to those\n\ninjuries.\n\n            This appeal followed and our review on summary judgment\n\nis de novo.    OneBeacon Ins. Co. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 474 F.3d\n\n6, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).         Massachusetts law, which governs in this\n\ncase, provides that an insurer's duty to defend against a third-\n\nparty suit is broader than its duty to indemnify, taking account of\n\nthe uncertainty as to what may be proved.           In determining whether\n\nthe duty to defend has been triggered, the complaint is to be\n\nconstrued broadly:\n\n            It is settled in this jurisdiction . . . that\n            the question of the initial duty of a liability\n            insurer to defend third-party actions against\n            the insured is decided by matching the third-\n            party complaint with the policy provisions: if\n            the allegations of the complaint are 'reasonably\n            susceptible' of an interpretation that they\n            state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy\n            terms, the insurer must undertake the defense.\n            Otherwise stated, the process is one of\n            envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as\n            lying within the range of the allegations of the\n            complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            fits the expectation of protective insurance\n            reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.2\n\n            By contrast, the duty to indemnify is triggered only\n\n\"when a judgment within the policy coverage is rendered against\n\n[the] insured.\"     Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. v. Commercial\n\nUnion Ins. Co., 545 N.E.2d 1156, 1158 (Mass. 1989) (\"BSO\").                      In\n\nresolving both duty questions, we focus (as the parties have done)\n\non the duty to defend.         As to it, the Modesto complaint is\n\nreasonably straightforward and there is little doubt that it\n\nalleged disparagement as one of the acts directed by Riso against\n\nits competitors.\n\n            Nevertheless,    the   allegations         made    by    the   Modesto\n\ncomplaint seem at first blush to fall outside the ambit of the\n\npolicies' express coverage. The pertinent policy language requires\n\nthat the injury in the underlying case \"aris[e] out of\" one of \"the\n\n[listed] offenses\"--and the pertinent listed offenses appear to be\n\nthe torts of libel, slander, and commercial disparagement.                      The\n\nModesto suit, a garden-variety antitrust suit, fits none of these\n\n\"offense\" categories.\n\n            Specifically, the Modesto complaint does not allege that\n\neither   the   Modesto    plaintiffs   or      their    \"goods,      products    or\n\nservices\"   were   ever   disparaged      by    Riso.         Thus   the   Modesto\n\n\n     2\n      Sterilite Corp. v. Cont'l Cas. Co., 458 N.E.2d 338, 340-41\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1983) (Kaplan, J.) (internal citations omitted);\nsee also Cont'l Cas. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co., 461 N.E.2d 209, 212\n(Mass. 1984).\n\n                                    -5-\n\fplaintiffs could not themselves maintain a defamation or commercial\n\ndisaragement action under California law; defamatory or disparaging\n\nstatements must be \"of and concerning\" the plaintiff.       Blatty v.\n\nNew York Times Co., 728 P.2d 1177, 1186-87 (Cal. 1986), cert.\n\ndenied, 485 U.S. 934 (1988).     A number of courts have therefore\n\ndismissed policy-coverage claims quite similar to that asserted by\n\nRiso in the present case.3\n\n            But the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\")\n\nchose a different path in BSO.         There the SJC found that the\n\ninsurer had a duty to defend the BSO in a breach of contract suit\n\nbrought by Vanessa Redgrave following the BSO's cancellation of her\n\nscheduled    performances.     Redgrave   alleged   that   the   BSO's\n\ncancellation had \"led others to refrain from hiring [her] for\n\nprofessional engagements\" by damaging her reputation, and sought\n\nconsequential damages \"analogous to damages for defamation.\"     BSO,\n\n545 N.E.2d at 1158 & n.4.\n\n            The policy language in BSO covered inter alia injuries\n\narising from \"offenses\" including \"the publication or utterance\n\n. . . of other defamatory [or] disparaging material.\"      545 N.E.2d\n\nat 1158-59.    Although Redgrave's complaint did not describe an\n\n\n\n     3\n      See, e.g., Microsoft Corp. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 2001 WL\n765871, at *6 (W.D. Wash. 2001) (applying Washington law); QSP,\nInc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 773 A.2d 906, 916, 918 (Conn. 2001)\n(applying Connecticut law); Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Nat'l Dairy\nHerd Improvement Ass'n, Inc., 750 N.E.2d 1169, 1175 (Ohio Ct. App.\n2001) (applying Ohio insurance law).\n\n                                 -6-\n\f\"offense\" of libel or slander or commercial disparagement, the SJC\n\nnonetheless held that the insurer had a duty to defend.               Noting\n\nthat ambiguities in the policy should be resolved against the\n\ninsurer, the SJC (id. at 1159) gave \"disparagement\" its ordinary\n\nmeaning--\"to speak slightingly of\"--and reasoned that\n\n           [t]he essence of Redgrave's claim . . . was\n           that the BSO's breach of contract somehow\n           spoke slightingly about her and damaged her\n           reputation.\n\n           Riso argues that BSO governs in this case because the\n\nModesto   complaint     charged    disparagement   in    the   lay   sense--\n\nspecifically,    by    Riso   of   its   competitors'   products--and   the\n\nunderlying plaintiffs' injuries allegedly \"arose out of\" this\n\ndisparagement.        That other wrongs were also alleged does not\n\nmatter, since the duty to defend is normally triggered where any of\n\nthe plaintiff's allegations invoke coverage.            1 B. Ostrager & T.\n\nNewman, Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes § 5.02[a](11th ed.\n\n2002).    GAIC responds that BSO should not be extended to an\n\nantitrust claim so fundamentally remote from its defamation and\n\ndisparagement policy coverage.\n\n           The language of Riso's policy differs from BSO's policy\n\nand perhaps more strongly suggests an intent to limit coverage to\n\nthe torts of libel, slander, and commercial disparagement.4             But,\n\n\n     4\n      Riso's policy covers injuries resulting from \"material that\n. . . disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or\nservices\"; by contrast, BSO's policy referred simply to \"other\n. . . disparaging material.\" While both phrases extend coverage to\n\n                                     -7-\n\fgiven the \"construe against\" canon relied upon in BSO, 545 N.E.2d\n\nat 1159, possibly the SJC would reject such a literal reading of\n\nthe Riso policy, just as it did in BSO itself.          But even if the SJC\n\ntreated the policies as similar, the complaints in the two cases\n\nare quite different.\n\n             The complaint in the BSO case, generously construed,\n\ncould   be   viewed     as    something   closely   related    to   a     classic\n\ndefamation claim. Although formally one for breach of contract, it\n\narguably     involved        representations   (implied       by    the     BSO's\n\ncancellation of the contract) damaging to the character of the\n\nplaintiff, directly impacting the plaintiff's reputation as an\n\nactress and causing damage to the plaintiff's earning capacity.\n\nId. at 1158.     The suit could be seen, by a stretch, as one for\n\ndefamation sailing under a foreign flag.\n\n             It would be hard to say the same about the Modesto\n\nantitrust complaint. Riso did not even arguably defame the Modesto\n\nplaintiffs or their educational services; the disparagement, if it\n\noccurred, was directed toward other commercial entities competing\n\nwith Riso; and the damages to the Modesto plaintiffs, if any\n\noccurred, were due to the higher costs caused by Riso's higher\n\nprices, rather than any injury to the plaintiffs' reputations.\n\n\n\n\ninjuries beyond those resulting from common law libel or slander,\nthe scope of Riso's coverage is narrower and focused on the\nelements of commercial disparagement.\n\n                                      -8-\n\f               BSO can be read modestly or for all it could be worth.\n\nWe think that the right course is the modest reading, which\n\ncertainly excludes coverage for an antitrust complaint like this\n\none.       BSO itself is a step beyond where most courts have gone; and,\n\nmechanically read, it could be extended indefinitely.         Imagine a\n\nsecurities fraud action in which the false boosting of the seller's\n\nstock involved (or implied) disparagement of a competing stock that\n\nthe buyer was considering.\n\n               Admittedly, one federal court in another circuit has\n\nfollowed BSO's logic into new territory.5         But we think it more\n\ntelling that the Massachusetts Appeals Court has declined to read\n\nBSO expansively.       New England Tea & Coffee Co. v. Fireman's Fund\n\nIns. Co., 763 N.E.2d 103, 104 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002).      The complaint\n\nin BSO was arguably close to classic defamation-–a view reflected\n\nin the BSO decision's own language.        545 N.E.2d at 1158 n.4, 1159.\n\nIf BSO is to be extended, it should by done by the SJC.\n\n               Riso argues that the policy language refers to \"material\n\n. . . that disparages a person's or organization's goods, products\n\nor services\" (emphasis added).        The indefinite article \"a,\" says\n\nRiso, indicates that the disparaged party need not be the same as\n\nthe underlying plaintiff, so long as the latter's injuries are\n\n\n\n       5\n      Knoll Pharm. Co. v. Auto. Ins. Co. of Hartford, 152 F. Supp.\n2d 1026, 1034 (N.D. Ill. 2001). But see QSP, 773 A.2d at 925-30;\nPurdue Frederick Co. v. Steadfast Ins. Co., 801 N.Y.S.2d 781 (N.Y.\nSup. Ct. 2005) (table), 2005 WL 1662028 at *7.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fcausally connected to covered conduct.    Cf. Knoll, 152 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 1034.   And, Riso reminds us, ambiguities in policy language are\n\nto be construed against the insurer.     BSO, 545 N.E.2d at 1159.\n\n           The ambiguities canon applies only where the policy can\n\nreasonably be read two ways, and the touchstone of coverage is\n\n\"expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the\n\nterms of the policy,\" Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins.\n\nCo., 788 N.E.2d 522, 531 (Mass. 2003) (quoting Sterilite, 458\n\nN.E.2d at 340-41).     Whatever the explanation for using \"a,\" the\n\nrelevant core coverage in Riso policies is for defamation and\n\ncommercial disparagement, and we think it unlikely in the extreme\n\nthat the policy drafter or purchaser intended coverage for the\n\nantitrust offense framed in the complaint.\n\n           We hold that the district court correctly ruled that the\n\ninsurer did not have a duty to defend Riso against the antitrust\n\ncomplaint--a complaint brought by plaintiffs who never themselves\n\nsuffered   any   reputational   injury   and   whose   allegations   of\n\ndisparagement instead concerned anticompetitive conduct directed\n\nagainst others not party to the suit.     On the present facts, this\n\nconclusion also negates any apparent basis for a duty to indemnify.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

Thus the <i>Modesto</i> plaintiffs could not themselves maintain a defamation or commercial disaragement action under California law; defamatory or disparaging statements must be \"of and concerning\" the plaintiff. <i>Blatty v. New York Times Co.,</i> 42 Cal.3d 1033, 232 Cal.Rptr. 542, 728 P.2d 1177, 1186-87 (1986), <i>cert. denied,</i> 485 U.S. 934, 108 S.Ct. 1107, 99 L.Ed.2d 268 (1988). A number of courts have therefore dismissed policy-coverage claims quite similar to that asserted by Riso in the present case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") chose a different path in <i>BSO.</i> There the SJC found that the insurer had a duty to defend the BSO in a breach of contract suit brought by Vanessa Redgrave following the BSO's cancellation of her scheduled performances. Redgrave alleged that the BSO's cancellation had \"led others to refrain from hiring [her] for professional engagements\" by damaging her reputation, and sought consequential damages \"analogous to damages for defamation.\" <i>BSO,</i> 545 N.E.2d at 1158 &amp; n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy language in <i>BSO</i> covered <i>inter alia</i> injuries arising from \"offenses\" including \"the publication or utterance . . . of other defamatory [or] disparaging material.\" 545 N.E.2d at 1158-59. Although Redgrave's complaint did not describe an \"offense\" of libel or slander or commercial disparagement, the SJC nonetheless held that the insurer had a duty to defend. Noting that ambiguities in the policy should be resolved against the insurer, the SJC (<i>id.</i> at 1159) gave \"disparagement\" its ordinary meaning&#8212;\"to speak slightingly of\"&#8212;and reasoned that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he essence of Redgrave's claim . . . was that the BSO's breach of contract somehow spoke slightingly about her and damaged her reputation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riso argues that <i>BSO</i> governs in this case because the <i>Modesto</i> complaint charged disparagement in the lay sense&#8212; specifically, by Riso of its competitors' products&#8212;and the underlying plaintiffs' injuries allegedly \"arose out of\" this disparagement. That other wrongs were also alleged does not matter, since the duty to defend is normally triggered where any of the plaintiff's allegations invoke coverage. 1 B. Ostrager &amp; T. Newman, <i>Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes</i> &#167; 5.02[a](11th ed.2002). GAIC responds that <i>BSO</i> should not be extended to an antitrust claim so fundamentally remote from its defamation and disparagement policy coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of Riso's policy differs from BSO's policy and perhaps more strongly suggests an intent to limit coverage to the torts of libel, slander, and commercial disparagement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> But, given the \"construe against\" canon relied upon in <i>BSO,</i> 545 N.E.2d at 1159, possibly the SJC would reject such a literal reading of the Riso policy, just as it did in <i>BSO</i> itself. But even if the SJC treated the policies as similar, the complaints in the two cases are quite different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint in the <i>BSO</i> case, generously construed, could be viewed as something closely related to a classic defamation claim. Although formally one for breach of contract, it arguably involved representations (implied by the BSO's cancellation of the contract) damaging to the character of the plaintiff, directly impacting the plaintiff's reputation as an actress and causing damage to the plaintiff's earning capacity. <i>Id.</i> at 1158. The suit could be seen, by a stretch, as one for defamation sailing under a foreign flag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be hard to say the same about the <i>Modesto</i> antitrust complaint. Riso did not even arguably defame the <i>Modesto</i> plaintiffs or their educational services; the disparagement, if it occurred, was directed toward other commercial entities competing with Riso; and the damages to the <i>Modesto</i> plaintiffs, if any occurred, were due to the higher costs caused by Riso's higher prices, rather than any injury to the plaintiffs' reputations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>BSO</i> can be read modestly or for all it could be worth. We think that the right course is the modest reading, which certainly excludes coverage for an antitrust complaint like this one. <i>BSO</i> itself is a step beyond where most courts have gone; and, mechanically read, it could be extended indefinitely. Imagine a securities fraud action in which the false boosting of the seller's stock involved (or implied) disparagement of a competing stock that the buyer was considering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, one federal court in another circuit has followed <i>BSO</i>'s logic into new territory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> But we think it more telling that the Massachusetts Appeals Court has declined to read <i>BSO</i> expansively. <i>New England Tea &amp; Coffee Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co.,</i> 54 Mass.App.Ct. 903, 763 N.E.2d 103, 104 (2002). The complaint in <i>BSO</i> was arguably close to classic defamation&#8212;a view reflected in the <i>BSO</i> decision's own language. 545 N.E.2d at 1158 n. 4, 1159. If <i>BSO</i> is to be extended, it should by done by the SJC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riso argues that the policy language refers to \"material . . . that disparages <i>a person's or organization's</i> goods, products or services\" (emphasis added). The indefinite article \"<i>a,</i>\" says Riso, indicates that the disparaged party need not be the same as the underlying plaintiff, so long as the latter's injuries are causally connected to covered conduct. <i>Cf. Knoll,</i> 152 F.Supp.2d at 1034. And, Riso reminds us, ambiguities in policy language are to be construed against the insurer. <i>BSO,</i> 545 N.E.2d at 1159.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ambiguities canon applies only where the policy can <i>reasonably</i> be read two ways, and the touchstone of coverage is \"expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy,\" <i>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 439 Mass. 387, 788 N.E.2d 522, 531 (2003) (quoting <i>Sterilite,</i> 458 N.E.2d at 340-41). Whatever the explanation for using \"a,\" the relevant core coverage in Riso policies is for defamation and commercial disparagement, and we think it unlikely in the extreme that the policy drafter or purchaser intended coverage for the antitrust offense framed in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the district court correctly ruled that the insurer did not have a duty to defend Riso against the antitrust complaint-a complaint brought by plaintiffs who never themselves suffered any reputational injury and whose allegations of disparagement instead concerned anticompetitive conduct directed against others not party to the suit. On the present facts, this conclusion also negates any apparent basis for a duty to indemnify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We use \"GAIC\" to refer collectively to Great American Insurance Company, Great American Insurance Company of New York, Great American Assurance Company, and Great American Alliance Insurance Company</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> <i>Sterilite Corp. v.

The means included refusing to sell replacement parts to independent service providers, territorial restraints on its own dealers, tying machine sales to use of Riso parts, and disparaging competitors in the supplies market as \"supply pirates\" whose products could \"cause serious damage\"&#8212;not covered by Riso's warranty&#8212;to the machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riso was protected during the period pertinent to the <i>Modesto</i> suit by primary and umbrella commercial general liability policies issued to it by GAIC between 1991 and 2000. The policies provided that GAIC would \"pay those sums that [Riso] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of `personal injury' . . . to which this insurance applies\" and that GAIC had \"the right and duty to defend [Riso] against any `suit' seeking those damages for `personal injury.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the <i>Modesto</i> complaint was filed, Riso gave notice of the suit to GAIC, asserting coverage under these policies. It relied on the allegations of disparagement in the antitrust complaint as triggering the \"personal injury\" coverage of its GAIC policies. The policies defined \"personal injury\" as \"injury, other than `bodily injury,' arising out of one or more of the following offenses,\" namely, malicious prosecution, false arrest, wrongful eviction, invasion of privacy, and&#8212;pertinent here&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d.

Redgrave alleged that the BSO's cancellation had \"led others to refrain from hiring [her] for professional engagements\" by damaging her reputation, and sought consequential damages \"analogous to damages for defamation.\" <i>BSO,</i> 545 N.E.2d at 1158 &amp; n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy language in <i>BSO</i> covered <i>inter alia</i> injuries arising from \"offenses\" including \"the publication or utterance . . . of other defamatory [or] disparaging material.\" 545 N.E.2d at 1158-59. Although Redgrave's complaint did not describe an \"offense\" of libel or slander or commercial disparagement, the SJC nonetheless held that the insurer had a duty to defend. Noting that ambiguities in the policy should be resolved against the insurer, the SJC (<i>id.</i> at 1159) gave \"disparagement\" its ordinary meaning&#8212;\"to speak slightingly of\"&#8212;and reasoned that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he essence of Redgrave's claim . . . was that the BSO's breach of contract somehow spoke slightingly about her and damaged her reputation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riso argues that <i>BSO</i> governs in this case because the <i>Modesto</i> complaint charged disparagement in the lay sense&#8212; specifically, by Riso of its competitors' products&#8212;and the underlying plaintiffs' injuries allegedly \"arose out of\" this disparagement. That other wrongs were also alleged does not matter, since the duty to defend is normally triggered where any of the plaintiff's allegations invoke coverage. 1 B. Ostrager &amp; T. Newman, <i>Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes</i> &#167; 5.02[a](11th ed.2002). GAIC responds that <i>BSO</i> should not be extended to an antitrust claim so fundamentally remote from its defamation and disparagement policy coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of Riso's policy differs from BSO's policy and perhaps more strongly suggests an intent to limit coverage to the torts of libel, slander, and commercial disparagement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> But, given the \"construe against\" canon relied upon in <i>BSO,</i> 545 N.E.2d at 1159, possibly the SJC would reject such a literal reading of the Riso policy, just as it did in <i>BSO</i> itself. But even if the SJC treated the policies as similar, the complaints in the two cases are quite different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint in the <i>BSO</i> case, generously construed, could be viewed as something closely related to a classic defamation claim. Although formally one for breach of contract, it arguably involved representations (implied by the BSO's cancellation of the contract) damaging to the character of the plaintiff, directly impacting the plaintiff's reputation as an actress and causing damage to the plaintiff's earning capacity. <i>Id.</i> at 1158. The suit could be seen, by a stretch, as one for defamation sailing under a foreign flag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be hard to say the same about the <i>Modesto</i> antitrust complaint. Riso did not even arguably defame the <i>Modesto</i> plaintiffs or their educational services; the disparagement, if it occurred, was directed toward other commercial entities competing with Riso; and the damages to the <i>Modesto</i> plaintiffs, if any occurred, were due to the higher costs caused by Riso's higher prices, rather than any injury to the plaintiffs' reputations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>BSO</i> can be read modestly or for all it could be worth. We think that the right course is the modest reading, which certainly excludes coverage for an antitrust complaint like this one. <i>BSO</i> itself is a step beyond where most courts have gone; and, mechanically read, it could be extended indefinitely. Imagine a securities fraud action in which the false boosting of the seller's stock involved (or implied) disparagement of a competing stock that the buyer was considering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, one federal court in another circuit has followed <i>BSO</i>'s logic into new territory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> But we think it more telling that the Massachusetts Appeals Court has declined to read <i>BSO</i> expansively. <i>New England Tea &amp; Coffee Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co.,</i> 54 Mass.App.Ct. 903, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span>, 104 (2002). The complaint in <i>BSO</i> was arguably close to classic defamation&#8212;a view reflected in the <i>BSO</i> decision's own language. 545 N.E.2d at 1158 n. 4, 1159. If <i>BSO</i> is to be extended, it should by done by the SJC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riso argues that the policy language refers to \"material . . . that disparages <i>a person's or organization's</i> goods, products or services\" (emphasis added). The indefinite article \"<i>a,</i>\" says Riso, indicates that the disparaged party need not be the same as the underlying plaintiff, so long as the latter's injuries are causally connected to covered conduct. <i>Cf. Knoll,</i> 152 F.Supp.2d at 1034. And, Riso reminds us, ambiguities in policy language are to be construed against the insurer. <i>BSO,</i> 545 N.E.2d at 1159.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ambiguities canon applies only where the policy can <i>reasonably</i> be read two ways, and the touchstone of coverage is \"expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy,\" <i>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></span>, 531 (2003) (quoting <i>Sterilite,</i> 458 N.E.2d at 340-41). Whatever the explanation for using \"a,\" the relevant core coverage in Riso policies is for defamation and commercial disparagement, and we think it unlikely in the extreme that the policy drafter or purchaser intended coverage for the antitrust offense framed in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the district court correctly ruled that the insurer did not have a duty to defend Riso against the antitrust complaint-a complaint brought by plaintiffs who never themselves suffered any reputational injury and whose allegations of disparagement instead concerned anticompetitive conduct directed against others not party to the suit. On the present facts, this conclusion also negates any apparent basis for a duty to indemnify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We use \"GAIC\" to refer collectively to Great American Insurance Company, Great American Insurance Company of New York, Great American Assurance Company, and Great American Alliance Insurance Company</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> <i>Sterilite Corp. v.
