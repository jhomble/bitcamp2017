Because  we\n\nagree with  the district court's finding  that plaintiff's 42\n\nU.S.C   1983 action is time-barred, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          The following facts are uncontested.  In July 1982,\n\nplaintiff  was hired  to work  at the  Sports Complex  at the\n\nstate-run   University  of   Puerto  Rico,   Mayaguez  Campus\n\n(\"University\").   From 1983 to present,  plaintiff has served\n\nas  the Sports  Complex's  \"Executive Official  I,\" a  career\n\nposition  roughly equivalent  to the  more familiar  title of\n\nDirector.1  Plaintiff  is also  an active member  of the  New\n\nProgressive Party (\"NPP\"), whose gubernatorial candidate lost\n\nthe general election in November 1984.   \n\n          In  August  1990, Ruiz,  an  active  member of  the\n\nPopular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"), was appointed Chancellor of\n\nthe University.  Three months after assuming office, Ruiz met\n\n                    \n\n1.  Under Puerto Rico law, employees with career status enjoy\nproperty rights  in their continued employment.   See Rivera-\n                                                             \nRuiz  v. Gonzalez-Rivera, 983 F.2d 332,  334 (1st Cir. 1993);\n                        \nKauffman  v. Puerto Rico Tel.  Co., 841 F.2d  1169, 1173 (1st\n                                  \nCir. 1988).\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nwith  the  University's Administrative  Board2  to  propose a\n\nreorganization  plan.   Under the  plan, the  Sports Complex,\n\nwhich had always operated  as an independent department under\n\nthe direct control of  the Chancellor, was to be  merged with\n\nthe Physical  Education Department  at the University's  Arts\n\nand Sciences College.   \n\n          On  November 15,  1990,  the  Administrative  Board\n\nunanimously approved the proposal to be effective December 1,\n\n1990,  and subject to review at the conclusion of the 1990-91\n\nacademic year.3   On or  about November  30, 1990,  plaintiff\n\nmet  with  Ruiz and  Hernandez, Dean  of  the Faculty  of the\n\nCollege of Arts and  Sciences, to discuss the reorganization.\n\nAt that meeting, Ruiz informed plaintiff that, under the  new\n\nstructure, plaintiff  would report  to Soto, Director  of the\n\nUniversity's  Physical  Education   Department  and,  in  her\n\nabsence,   to   Carrero,  Associate   Director   of  Physical\n\nEducation.  Ruiz also gave plaintiff a  letter dated November\n\n30, 1990, which formally detailed the new arrangement.\n\n          Between December  1, 1990,  and February 20,  1991,\n\nplaintiff missed forty-seven  days of work.  In  his absence,\n\nSoto    and    Hernandez    temporarily   took    over    his\n\nresponsibilities, including the  review of mail addressed  to\n\n                    \n\n2.  Both Ruiz and Hernandez are members of the Administrative\nBoard.  \n\n3.  The second semester ended in May 1991.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nplaintiff.    On  April 12,  1991,  plaintiff  wrote to  Soto\n\nstating  that although he returned to work as of February 20,\n\n1991, he had  not been  assigned any tasks.   Plaintiff  also\n\ncomplained  that the  duties  he  used  to perform  were  now\n\ndischarged by Soto and Carrero.  Five days later, in a letter\n\ndated April 17, 1991, Soto provided plaintiff with a detailed\n\ndescription of his responsibilities  under the new structure.\n\nIn  that letter, Soto  remarked that  the duties  as outlined\n\n\"follow  the provisions  of the  [personnel form]  you signed\n\nwith the Campus.\"   Thereafter,  on May  1, 1991,  plaintiff,\n\nSoto  and Carrero met  to clarify the  functions described in\n\nthe April 17 letter.  In his final relevant correspondence, a\n\nMay  9, 1991, letter to Soto, plaintiff wrote:  \"After having\n\nevaluated the duties assigned  to me it is easy  to interpret\n\nthat I have been demoted from my position and functions.\"  In\n\nclosing, plaintiff  noted that  he would continue  to perform\n\nhis duties  as assigned.  Thereafter,  plaintiff continued to\n\nserve as  Executive Director I, occupying his same office and\n\nsuffering no reduction in salary.\n\n          On June 26, 1992, plaintiff filed a complaint under\n\n42 U.S.C.   1983, charging  Ruiz, Hernandez, Soto and Carrero\n\nwith  political  discrimination in  violation  of plaintiff's\n\nFirst, Fifth  and  Fourteenth Amendment  rights.    Plaintiff\n\ncharged,  inter alia,  that  he was  the  victim of  \"illegal\n                    \n\nactivity\"  since November 1984, such activity intensifying in\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nAugust 1990  when the four defendants,  all allegedly members\n\nof the then-ruling  PDP or some unspecified party  other than\n\nthe  NPP,  plotted  to  effect  the  reorganization,  thereby\n\nattempting  to  demote   plaintiff  solely  because   of  his\n\nmembership  in the  NPP.   Plaintiff's complaint  sought both\n\nmonetary damages and injunctive relief.  \n\n          On February 25, 1993, defendants filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment arguing, inter alia, that the    1983 action\n                                    \n\nwas  time-barred.      Plaintiff  filed   an  opposition   to\n\ndefendants'  motion on  April 21,  1993.   In an  opinion and\n\norder  dated  May  24,   1993,  the  district  court  granted\n\ndefendants'  motion,  finding  among other  things,  that the\n\npurported discrimination  occurred outside of the  statute of\n\nlimitations period.   The  district court further  found that\n\nplaintiff  had not  alleged sufficient  facts to  suspend the\n\nlimitations  period under  a \"continuing  violations\" theory.\n\nIt is from these rulings that plaintiff appeals.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n                                        \n\n          Summary judgment  is  appropriate when  the  record\n\nreflects \"no genuine issue as to  any material fact and . . .\n\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ.  P. 56(c).   \"In this  context, `genuine'  means\n\nthat the  evidence  is  such  that a  reasonable  jury  could\n\nresolve  the   point  in  favor  of   the  nonmoving  party.\"\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nRodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982  F.2d 34, 38 (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1993)  (internal  quotations  and  citations  omitted).    As\n\nalways,  we  review  grants  of  summary  judgment  de  novo,\n                                                            \n\nindulging all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant's favor.\n\nSee  Levy v.  FDIC,  7  F.3d  1054,  1056  (1st  Cir.  1993).\n                  \n\nNonetheless,  the nonmovant  may not  rely upon  \"unsupported\n\nallegations; rather, [s/]he must set forth specific facts, in\n\nsuitable  evidentiary  form,   in  order  to  establish   the\n\nexistence of  a genuine issue for trial.\"  Rivera-Muriente v.\n                                                          \n\nAgosto-Alicia, 959 F.2d 349,  352 (1st Cir. 1992).   \"A party\n             \n\nopposing  a summary  judgment  motion must  inform the  trial\n\njudge of the reasons, legal  or factual, why summary judgment\n\nshould not be  entered.

In essence, he\n\nargues that the  Administrative Board did not  have the power\n\nto  effect  the  reorganization,  that  his  \"demotion\"   was\n\ntherefore   invalid,  and  that  any  and  all  repercussions\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nstemming  from this  \"illegal demotion\"  constituted separate\n\nand   actionable   \"continuing  violations\"   of  plaintiff's\n\nconstitutional rights, each restarting the limitations clock.\n\nWe do not agree.\n\nA.  Statute of Limitations\n                          \n\n          \"Under 42  U.S.C.    1983, an  aggrieved individual\n\nmay sue persons who, acting under color of state law, abridge\n\nrights, immunities, or privileges created by the Constitution\n\nor laws of  the United  States.\"  Johnson  v. Rodriguez,  943\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 104, 108 (1st  Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112  S. Ct. 948\n                                            \n\n(1992). Whereas the personal injury statute of limitations of\n\nthe forum state governs in   1983 actions, see, e.g. Owens v.\n                                                          \n\nOkure, 488 U.S. 235,  236 (1989), the date of  accrual, i.e.,\n     \n\nthe  date on which the  limitations clock begins  to tick, is\n\ndetermined by reference to federal law.  Rivera-Muriente, 959\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at  352.   Puerto Rico's  applicable statute, P.R.  Laws\n\nAnn.  tit.   31,      5298  (1991),  prescribes   a  one-year\n\nlimitations  period beginning  on the  date of accrual.   Id.\n                                                             \n\nUnder federal law, the  limitations \"period in a    1983 case\n\nordinarily  starts when the plaintiff knows, or has reason to\n\nknow, of  the harm on which the action is based.\"  Id. at 353\n                                                      \n\n(collecting cases).\n\n          We  begin  by  noting  that  if  any  civil  rights\n\nviolation  occurred here,  it occurred  on December  1, 1990,\n\nwhen   the    Administrative-Board-approved   merger   became\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\neffective.  Plaintiff, by his own testimony, knew of the full\n\nimpact of  the transfer, at the very latest, in May 1991 when\n\nplaintiff wrote to Soto  that he would perform his  duties as\n\nassigned  even  though  he  believed  he  had  been  demoted.\n\nTherefore, plaintiff's one-year limitations  period commenced\n\nat the very latest in May  1991 and terminated in May 1992, a\n\nfull  month  before  the  filing  of  plaintiff's  complaint.\n\nMoreover, as  the district court found,  plaintiff has failed\n\nto allege sufficient facts  to suspend the limitations period\n\nunder a continuing violation theory.\n\nB.  \"Continuing Violation\" Theory\n                                 \n\n          To  establish  a  continuing  violation,  plaintiff\n\n\"`must allege that  a discriminatory act  occurred or that  a\n\ndiscriminatory  policy existed' within  the period prescribed\n\nby the statute.\"  Johnson v. General Elec., 840 F.2d 132, 137\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1988)  (quoting Velazquez v. Chardon, 736 F.2d 831,\n                                              \n\n833  (1st Cir. 1984)).  There are two varieties of continuing\n\nviolations:  serial and systemic.  Kassaye v. Bryant College,\n                                                            \n\n999 F.2d 603,  606 (1st  Cir. 1993).   Serial violations  are\n\n\"composed of  a number of discriminatory  acts emanating from\n\nthe  same  discriminatory  animus, each  act  constituting  a\n\nseparate [actionable] wrong.\"  Jenson v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517,\n                                              \n\n522  (1st  Cir.  1990).     Plaintiff  bears  the  burden  of\n\ndemonstrating that  at least one  discriminatory act occurred\n\nwithin the limitations period.   See id.; Mack v.  Great Atl.\n                                                             \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nand  Pac.

It is not enough  to show that\n         \n\nplaintiff  is  merely feeling  the  effects  of some  earlier\n\ndiscriminatory action.  In other words, there is a  \"critical\n\ndistinction between a continuing act  and a singular act that\n\nbrings continuing consequences in its roiled wake.\"  Johnson,\n                                                            \n\n943 F.2d at  108 (internal citations omitted); see also Mack,\n                                                            \n\n871 F.2d at 182 (\"In any such analysis, it is imperative that\n\nwe distinguish between the occurrence of a discriminatory act\n\nand  the  later effects  of  that act.\");  Goldman  v. Sears,\n                                                             \n\nRoebuck  &amp; Co.,  607  F.2d 1014,  1018  (1st Cir.  1979)  (\"A\n              \n\ncontinuing violation is  not stated if all  that appears from\n\nthe complaint is that the plaintiff continues to suffer  from\n\nthe ongoing  effects of  some past act  of discrimination.\"),\n\ncert.  denied, 445 U.S. 929 (1980).   Systemic violations, on\n             \n\nthe other  hand, \"need  not involve an  identifiable discrete\n\nact  of  discrimination  transpiring  within  the  limitation\n\nperiod.\"  Jenson, 912 F.2d at 523.  Rather what must be shown\n                \n\nis that plaintiff  has been  harmed by the  application of  a\n\ndiscriminatory  policy  or  practice  and  that  such  policy\n                                    \n\ncontinues into the limitations period.  Id.\n                                           \n\n          First, plaintiff has failed to show that any of the\n\nactions that allegedly occurred within  the year prior to the\n\nfiling of the complaint, i.e. Soto's (1) refusal, purportedly\n\nfor  reasons  of building  security,  to  give plaintiff  new\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nmaster  keys  to  the Sports  Complex,  (2)  opening of  mail\n\naddressed  to  plaintiff,  (3)  hiring of  a  Sports  Complex\n\nemployee, and  (4) representations that she  was the Director\n\nof the Sports Complex,  constituted separate and actionable  \n\n1983 violations.4   Rather,  these incidents are  natural and\n\nforeseeable consequences of the  1990 merger (which made Soto\n\nresponsible  for  the  overall   management  of  the  Sport's\n\nComplex),  and  plaintiff's  subsequent  47-day  absence from\n\nwork.    See  generally Kassaye,  999  F.2d  at  603 (private\n                               \n\ncollege's request that professor vacate his office was merely\n\nan  effect and not an independent incarnation of past alleged\n\ndiscriminatory refusal to grant tenure  on basis of race); De\n                                                             \n\nLeon  Ortero v.

Plaintiff  has failed  to  refute any  of the  statements\nproffered by  defendants in defense  of their  actions.   For\nexample,   plaintiff  has   not  contradicted   Soto's  sworn\nstatement that she denied  plaintiff (and others) master keys\nto the Sports  Complex for security reasons,  that she opened\nplaintiff's mail because he was absent from work, or that her\nassignment of plaintiff's duties mirrored his job description\nas set  forth in  his personnel  form.   Moreover,  plaintiff\nalleged that  Soto represented  herself as the  \"Director\" of\nthe  Sports Complex on letters dated December 4, 1991 and May\n28, 1992.   A review of  the letters shows  that Soto  signed\n\"Dr. Soto, Director.\"  At the time Soto signed these letters,\nshe was the Director of the Physical Education Department.  \n       \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          Secondly,  because plaintiff has failed to identify\n\nany discriminatory  policy or  practice in effect  during the\n\nstatutory  period,  he fares  no  better  under the  systemic\n\nviolation theory.   Instead of \"alleg[ing]  facts which would\n\nenable  a  jury  to  conclude that  [he]  had  suffered  from\n\npolitical discrimination in the year before [he] filed suit,\"\n\nVelazquez, 736 F.2d at 834, plaintiff has simply alleged that\n         \n\nevery time Soto carried out  her position as supervisor,  she\n\nresurrected  a general political  plot designed by defendants\n\nto  harm  and  humiliate plaintiff.    This  is not  enough.5\n\nPlaintiff  has failed  to proffer  any  evidence that  he was\n\ntreated differentlythan members ofparties other thanthe NPP.6\n\n                    \n\n5.  Plaintiff's evidence of discriminatory animus consists of\nthe following:\n\n          Close to the date  in which Carlos Romero\n          Barcelo  lost   the  elections  [November\n          1984],  Dr.  Karen Soto  came  to  me and\n          asked me what  was I going to do now that\n          the New Progressive Party had lost.\n\nPlaintiff  has   neglected  to   show  how  this   dated  and\ninconclusive statement  evidences a policy  of discrimination\nwhich continued into the limitations  period, or how it could\nsupport \"a finding  that [plaintiff was] treated  differently\nthan [he]  would  have  been  treated had  [he]  belonged  to\n[defendants'] political part[ies].\"  Id. at 836.  \n                                        \n\n6.  Plaintiff  further  contends  that because  the  original\nreorganization  was  illegal,  any fallout  from  the  merger\nconstituted  an  independent act  of  demotion.   We  are not\npersuaded.    Under  plaintiff's  novel theory,  any  demoted\nemployee  with a  potential  cause of  action  could wait  an\nindefinite period of  time before  bringing a    1983  action\nbecause every day s/he went to work, s/he was affected.  This\nis absurd.  Statute of limitations are designed to keep stale\nclaims out of court.  See Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455\n                                                        \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n          Because \"`the proper focus [in continuing violation\n\nanalysis] is on the  time of the discriminatory act,  not the\n                                                   \n\npoint at which the consequences  of the act become painful,'\"\n                               \n\nMack  871 F.2d at 182 (quoting Chardon v.

Because we agree with the district court's finding that plaintiff's 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 action is time-barred, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are uncontested.  In July 1982, plaintiff was hired to work at the Sports Complex at the state-run University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus (\"University\").  From 1983 to present, plaintiff has served as the Sports Complex's \"Executive Official I,\" a career position roughly equivalent to the more familiar title of Director.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Plaintiff is also an active member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), whose gubernatorial candidate lost the general election in November 1984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1990, Ruiz, an active member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"), was appointed Chancellor of the University.  Three months after assuming office, Ruiz met with the University's Administrative Board<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to propose a reorganization plan.  Under the plan, the Sports Complex, which had always operated as an independent department under the direct control of the Chancellor, was to be merged with the Physical Education Department at the University's Arts and Sciences College.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 1990, the Administrative Board unanimously approved the proposal to be effective December 1, 1990, and subject to review at the conclusion of the 1990-91 academic year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  On or about November 30, 1990, plaintiff met with Ruiz and Hernandez, Dean of the Faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences, to discuss the reorganization.  At that meeting, Ruiz informed plaintiff that, under the new structure, plaintiff would report to Soto, Director of the University's Physical Education Department and, in her absence, to Carrero, Associate Director of Physical Education.  Ruiz also gave plaintiff a letter dated November 30, 1990, which formally detailed the new arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between December 1, 1990, and February 20, 1991, plaintiff missed forty-seven days of work.  In his absence, Soto and Hernandez temporarily took over his responsibilities, including the review of mail addressed to plaintiff.  On April 12, 1991, plaintiff wrote to Soto stating that although he returned to work as of February 20, 1991, he had not been assigned any tasks.  Plaintiff also complained that the duties he used to perform were now discharged by Soto and Carrero.  Five days later, in a letter dated April 17, 1991, Soto provided plaintiff with a detailed description of his responsibilities under the new structure.  In that letter, Soto remarked that the duties as outlined \"follow the provisions of the [personnel form] you signed with the Campus.\"   Thereafter, on May 1, 1991, plaintiff, Soto and Carrero met to clarify the functions described in the April 17 letter.  In his final relevant correspondence, a May 9, 1991, letter to Soto, plaintiff wrote:  \"After having evaluated the duties assigned to me it is easy to interpret that I have been demoted from my position and functions.\"   In closing, plaintiff noted that he would continue to perform his duties as assigned.  Thereafter, plaintiff continued to serve as Executive Director I, occupying his same office and suffering no reduction in salary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 1992, plaintiff filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, charging Ruiz, Hernandez, Soto and Carrero with political discrimination in violation of plaintiff's First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Plaintiff charged, inter alia, that he was the victim of \"illegal activity\" since November 1984, such activity intensifying in August 1990 when the four defendants, all allegedly members of the then-ruling PDP or some unspecified party other than the NPP, plotted to effect the reorganization, thereby attempting to demote plaintiff solely because of his membership in the NPP.  Plaintiff's complaint sought both monetary damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 1993, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment arguing, inter alia, that the Sec. 1983 action was time-barred.  Plaintiff filed an opposition to defendants' motion on April 21, 1993.  In an opinion and order dated May 24, 1993, the district court granted defendants' motion, finding among other things, that the purported discrimination occurred outside of the statute of limitations period, 826 F.Supp. 591.   The district court further found that plaintiff had not alleged sufficient facts to suspend the limitations period under a \"continuing violations\" theory.  It is from these rulings that plaintiff appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when the record reflects \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  \"In this context, 'genuine' means that the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party.\"  Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982 F.2d 34, 38 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  As always, we review grants of summary judgment de novo, indulging all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant's favor.  See Levy v. FDIC, 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir.1993).  Nonetheless, the nonmovant may not rely upon \"unsupported allegations;  rather, [s/]he must set forth specific facts, in suitable evidentiary form, in order to establish the existence of a genuine issue for trial.\"  Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 352 (1st Cir.1992).  \"A party opposing a summary judgment motion must inform the trial judge of the reasons, legal or factual, why summary judgment should not be entered.  If it does not do so, and loses the motion, it cannot raise such reasons on appeal.\"  Rodriguez-Pinto, 982 F.2d at 41 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Finally, \"Rule 56 may be used to determine the applicability of a statutory time bar to a particular set of facts.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff argues that the district court erred in finding that his complaint was time-barred.  In essence, he argues that the Administrative Board did not have the power to effect the reorganization, that his \"demotion\" was therefore invalid, and that any and all repercussions stemming from this \"illegal demotion\" constituted separate and actionable \"continuing violations\" of plaintiff's constitutional rights, each restarting the limitations clock.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, an aggrieved individual may sue persons who, acting under color of state law, abridge rights, immunities, or privileges created by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"  Johnson v. Rodriguez, 943 F.2d 104, 108 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 948, 117 L.Ed.2d 117 (1992).  Whereas the personal injury statute of limitations of the forum state governs in Sec. 1983 actions, see, e.g. Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 236, 109 S.Ct. 573, 574, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989), the date of accrual, i.e., the date on which the limitations clock begins to tick, is determined by reference to federal law.  Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 352.   Puerto Rico's applicable statute, P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5298 (1991), prescribes a one-year limitations period beginning on the date of accrual.  Id.  Under federal law, the limitations \"period in a Sec. 1983 case ordinarily starts when the plaintiff knows, or has reason to know, of the harm on which the action is based.\"  Id. at 353 (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that if any civil rights violation occurred here, it occurred on December 1, 1990, when the Administrative-Board-approved merger became effective.  Plaintiff, by his own testimony, knew of the full impact of the transfer, at the very latest, in May 1991 when plaintiff wrote to Soto that he would perform his duties as assigned even though he believed he had been demoted.  Therefore, plaintiff's one-year limitations period commenced at the very latest in May 1991 and terminated in May 1992, a full month before the filing of plaintiff's complaint.  Moreover, as the district court found, plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to suspend the limitations period under a continuing violation theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. \"Continuing Violation\" Theory</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a continuing violation, plaintiff \" 'must allege that a discriminatory act occurred or that a discriminatory policy existed' within the period prescribed by the statute.\"  Johnson v. General Elec., 840 F.2d 132, 137 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting Velazquez v. Chardon, 736 F.2d 831, 833 (1st Cir.1984)).  There are two varieties of continuing violations:  serial and systemic.  Kassaye v. Bryant College, 999 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir.1993).  Serial violations are \"composed of a number of discriminatory acts emanating from the same discriminatory animus, each act constituting a separate [actionable] wrong.\"  Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 522 (1st Cir.1990).  Plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that at least one discriminatory act occurred within the limitations period.  See id.;  Mack v. Great Atl. and Pac.  Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 183 (1st Cir.1989);  Velazquez, 736 F.2d at 833.   It is not enough to show that plaintiff is merely feeling the effects of some earlier discriminatory action.  In other words, there is a \"critical distinction between a continuing act and a singular act that brings continuing consequences in its roiled wake.\"  Johnson, 943 F.2d at 108 (internal citations omitted);  see also Mack, 871 F.2d at 182 (\"In any such analysis, it is imperative that we distinguish between the occurrence of a discriminatory act and the later effects of that act.\");  Goldman v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 607 F.2d 1014, 1018 (1st Cir.1979) (\"A continuing violation is not stated if all that appears from the complaint is that the plaintiff continues to suffer from the ongoing effects of some past act of discrimination.\"), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 929, 100 S.Ct. 1317, 63 L.Ed.2d 762 (1980).  Systemic violations, on the other hand, \"need not involve an identifiable discrete act of discrimination transpiring within the limitation period.\"  Jensen, 912 F.2d at 523.   Rather what must be shown is that plaintiff has been harmed by the application of a discriminatory policy or practice and that such policy continues into the limitations period.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, plaintiff has failed to show that any of the actions that allegedly occurred within the year prior to the filing of the complaint, i.e. Soto's (1) refusal, purportedly for reasons of building security, to give plaintiff new master keys to the Sports Complex, (2) opening of mail addressed to plaintiff, (3) hiring of a Sports Complex employee, and (4) representations that she was the Director of the Sports Complex, constituted separate and actionable Sec. 1983 violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Rather, these incidents are natural and foreseeable consequences of the 1990 merger (which made Soto responsible for the overall management of the Sport's Complex), and plaintiff's subsequent 47-day absence from work.  See generally Kassaye, 999 F.2d at 603 (private college's request that professor vacate his office was merely an effect and not an independent incarnation of past alleged discriminatory refusal to grant tenure on basis of race);  De Leon Otero v. Rubero, 820 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir.1987) (defendants' refusal to reinstate plaintiff \"was not a separate act of discrimination, but rather a consequence of his initial demotion\");  Velazquez, 736 F.2d at 833 (demotion followed by defendant's repeated refusals to reinstate plaintiff did not constitute a continuing violation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, because plaintiff has failed to identify any discriminatory policy or practice in effect during the statutory period, he fares no better under the systemic violation theory.  Instead of \"alleg[ing] facts which would enable a jury to conclude that [he] had suffered from political discrimination in the year before [he] filed suit,\" Velazquez, 736 F.2d at 834, plaintiff has simply alleged that every time Soto carried out her position as supervisor, she resurrected a general political plot designed by defendants to harm and humiliate plaintiff.  This is not enough.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Plaintiff has failed to proffer any evidence that he was treated differently than members of parties other than the NPP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because \" 'the proper focus [in continuing violation analysis] is on the time of the discriminatory act, not the point at which the consequences of the act become painful,' \" Mack 871 F.2d at 182 (quoting Chardon v.

For example, plaintiff has not contradicted Soto's sworn statement that she denied plaintiff (and others) master keys to the Sports Complex for security reasons, that she opened plaintiff's mail because he was absent from work, or that her assignment of plaintiff's duties mirrored his job description as set forth in his personnel form.  Moreover, plaintiff alleged that Soto represented herself as the \"Director\" of the Sports Complex on letters dated December 4, 1991 and May 28, 1992.  A review of the letters shows that Soto signed \"Dr. Soto, Director.\"   At the time Soto signed these letters, she was the Director of the Physical Education Department</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff's evidence of discriminatory animus consists of the following:</p>\n        <p>Close to the date in which Carlos Romero Barcelo lost the elections [November 1984], Dr. Karen Soto came to me and asked me what was I going to do now that the New Progressive Party had lost.</p>\n        <p>Plaintiff has neglected to show how this dated and inconclusive statement evidences a policy of discrimination which continued into the limitations period, or how it could support \"a finding that [plaintiff was] treated differently than [he] would have been treated had [he] belonged to [defendants'] political part[ies].\"  Id. at 836.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff further contends that because the original reorganization was illegal, any fallout from the merger constituted an independent act of demotion.

Because we agree with the district court's finding that plaintiff's 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 action is time-barred, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are uncontested.  In July 1982, plaintiff was hired to work at the Sports Complex at the state-run University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus (\"University\").  From 1983 to present, plaintiff has served as the Sports Complex's \"Executive Official I,\" a career position roughly equivalent to the more familiar title of Director.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Plaintiff is also an active member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), whose gubernatorial candidate lost the general election in November 1984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1990, Ruiz, an active member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"), was appointed Chancellor of the University.  Three months after assuming office, Ruiz met with the University's Administrative Board<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to propose a reorganization plan.  Under the plan, the Sports Complex, which had always operated as an independent department under the direct control of the Chancellor, was to be merged with the Physical Education Department at the University's Arts and Sciences College.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 1990, the Administrative Board unanimously approved the proposal to be effective December 1, 1990, and subject to review at the conclusion of the 1990-91 academic year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  On or about November 30, 1990, plaintiff met with Ruiz and Hernandez, Dean of the Faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences, to discuss the reorganization.  At that meeting, Ruiz informed plaintiff that, under the new structure, plaintiff would report to Soto, Director of the University's Physical Education Department and, in her absence, to Carrero, Associate Director of Physical Education.  Ruiz also gave plaintiff a letter dated November 30, 1990, which formally detailed the new arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between December 1, 1990, and February 20, 1991, plaintiff missed forty-seven days of work.  In his absence, Soto and Hernandez temporarily took over his responsibilities, including the review of mail addressed to plaintiff.  On April 12, 1991, plaintiff wrote to Soto stating that although he returned to work as of February 20, 1991, he had not been assigned any tasks.  Plaintiff also complained that the duties he used to perform were now discharged by Soto and Carrero.  Five days later, in a letter dated April 17, 1991, Soto provided plaintiff with a detailed description of his responsibilities under the new structure.  In that letter, Soto remarked that the duties as outlined \"follow the provisions of the [personnel form] you signed with the Campus.\"   Thereafter, on May 1, 1991, plaintiff, Soto and Carrero met to clarify the functions described in the April 17 letter.  In his final relevant correspondence, a May 9, 1991, letter to Soto, plaintiff wrote:  \"After having evaluated the duties assigned to me it is easy to interpret that I have been demoted from my position and functions.\"   In closing, plaintiff noted that he would continue to perform his duties as assigned.  Thereafter, plaintiff continued to serve as Executive Director I, occupying his same office and suffering no reduction in salary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 1992, plaintiff filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, charging Ruiz, Hernandez, Soto and Carrero with political discrimination in violation of plaintiff's First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Plaintiff charged, inter alia, that he was the victim of \"illegal activity\" since November 1984, such activity intensifying in August 1990 when the four defendants, all allegedly members of the then-ruling PDP or some unspecified party other than the NPP, plotted to effect the reorganization, thereby attempting to demote plaintiff solely because of his membership in the NPP.  Plaintiff's complaint sought both monetary damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 1993, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment arguing, inter alia, that the Sec. 1983 action was time-barred.  Plaintiff filed an opposition to defendants' motion on April 21, 1993.  In an opinion and order dated May 24, 1993, the district court granted defendants' motion, finding among other things, that the purported discrimination occurred outside of the statute of limitations period, 826 F.Supp. 591.   The district court further found that plaintiff had not alleged sufficient facts to suspend the limitations period under a \"continuing violations\" theory.  It is from these rulings that plaintiff appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when the record reflects \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  \"In this context, 'genuine' means that the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party.\"  Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597138\"><a href=\"/opinion/597138/pedro-l-rodriguez-pinto-v-cirilo-tirado-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  As always, we review grants of summary judgment de novo, indulging all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant's favor.  See Levy v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194983\"><a href=\"/opinion/194983/levy-v-weinhold/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span>, 1056 (1st Cir.1993).  Nonetheless, the nonmovant may not rely upon \"unsupported allegations;  rather, [s/]he must set forth specific facts, in suitable evidentiary form, in order to establish the existence of a genuine issue for trial.\"  Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 352 (1st Cir.1992).  \"A party opposing a summary judgment motion must inform the trial judge of the reasons, legal or factual, why summary judgment should not be entered.  If it does not do so, and loses the motion, it cannot raise such reasons on appeal.\"  Rodriguez-Pinto, 982 F.2d at 41 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Finally, \"Rule 56 may be used to determine the applicability of a statutory time bar to a particular set of facts.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff argues that the district court erred in finding that his complaint was time-barred.  In essence, he argues that the Administrative Board did not have the power to effect the reorganization, that his \"demotion\" was therefore invalid, and that any and all repercussions stemming from this \"illegal demotion\" constituted separate and actionable \"continuing violations\" of plaintiff's constitutional rights, each restarting the limitations clock.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, an aggrieved individual may sue persons who, acting under color of state law, abridge rights, immunities, or privileges created by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"  Johnson v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567585\"><a href=\"/opinion/567585/leroy-h-johnson-jr-v-alex-rodriguez-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 108 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></span> (1992).  Whereas the personal injury statute of limitations of the forum state governs in Sec. 1983 actions, see, e.g. Owens v. Okure, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112166\"><a href=\"/opinion/112166/owens-v-okure/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span>, 236, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112166\"><a href=\"/opinion/112166/owens-v-okure/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 574, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112166\"><a href=\"/opinion/112166/owens-v-okure/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span> (1989), the date of accrual, i.e., the date on which the limitations clock begins to tick, is determined by reference to federal law.  Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 352.   Puerto Rico's applicable statute, P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5298 (1991), prescribes a one-year limitations period beginning on the date of accrual.  Id.  Under federal law, the limitations \"period in a Sec. 1983 case ordinarily starts when the plaintiff knows, or has reason to know, of the harm on which the action is based.\"  Id. at 353 (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that if any civil rights violation occurred here, it occurred on December 1, 1990, when the Administrative-Board-approved merger became effective.  Plaintiff, by his own testimony, knew of the full impact of the transfer, at the very latest, in May 1991 when plaintiff wrote to Soto that he would perform his duties as assigned even though he believed he had been demoted.  Therefore, plaintiff's one-year limitations period commenced at the very latest in May 1991 and terminated in May 1992, a full month before the filing of plaintiff's complaint.  Moreover, as the district court found, plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to suspend the limitations period under a continuing violation theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. \"Continuing Violation\" Theory</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a continuing violation, plaintiff \" 'must allege that a discriminatory act occurred or that a discriminatory policy existed' within the period prescribed by the statute.\"  Johnson v. General Elec., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502255\"><a href=\"/opinion/502255/earl-johnson-v-general-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span>, 137 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting Velazquez v. Chardon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437233\"><a href=\"/opinion/437233/juan-a-valles-velazquez-v-carlos-e-chardon-etc-agustin-lao-colon-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span>, 833 (1st Cir.1984)).  There are two varieties of continuing violations:  serial and systemic.  Kassaye v. Bryant College, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"612080\"><a href=\"/opinion/612080/wandwossen-kassaye-v-bryant-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir.1993).  Serial violations are \"composed of a number of discriminatory acts emanating from the same discriminatory animus, each act constituting a separate [actionable] wrong.\"  Jensen v. Frank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547202\"><a href=\"/opinion/547202/53-fair-emplpraccas-1450-54-empl-prac-dec-p-40191-donald-a-jensen/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 522 (1st Cir.1990).  Plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that at least one discriminatory act occurred within the limitations period.  See id.;  Mack v. Great Atl. and Pac.  Tea Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520577\"><a href=\"/opinion/520577/thomasina-mack-v-the-great-atlantic-and-pacific-tea-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 183 (1st Cir.1989);  Velazquez, 736 F.2d at 833.   It is not enough to show that plaintiff is merely feeling the effects of some earlier discriminatory action.  In other words, there is a \"critical distinction between a continuing act and a singular act that brings continuing consequences in its roiled wake.\"  Johnson, 943 F.2d at 108 (internal citations omitted);  see also Mack, 871 F.2d at 182 (\"In any such analysis, it is imperative that we distinguish between the occurrence of a discriminatory act and the later effects of that act.\");  Goldman v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></span> (1980).  Systemic violations, on the other hand, \"need not involve an identifiable discrete act of discrimination transpiring within the limitation period.\"  Jensen, 912 F.2d at 523.   Rather what must be shown is that plaintiff has been harmed by the application of a discriminatory policy or practice and that such policy continues into the limitations period.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, plaintiff has failed to show that any of the actions that allegedly occurred within the year prior to the filing of the complaint, i.e. Soto's (1) refusal, purportedly for reasons of building security, to give plaintiff new master keys to the Sports Complex, (2) opening of mail addressed to plaintiff, (3) hiring of a Sports Complex employee, and (4) representations that she was the Director of the Sports Complex, constituted separate and actionable Sec. 1983 violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Rather, these incidents are natural and foreseeable consequences of the 1990 merger (which made Soto responsible for the overall management of the Sport's Complex), and plaintiff's subsequent 47-day absence from work.  See generally Kassaye, 999 F.2d at 603 (private college's request that professor vacate his office was merely an effect and not an independent incarnation of past alleged discriminatory refusal to grant tenure on basis of race);  De Leon Otero v. Rubero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489325\"><a href=\"/opinion/489325/angel-r-de-leon-otero-v-maria-l-rubero/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.1987) (defendants' refusal to reinstate plaintiff \"was not a separate act of discrimination, but rather a consequence of his initial demotion\");  Velazquez, 736 F.2d at 833 (demotion followed by defendant's repeated refusals to reinstate plaintiff did not constitute a continuing violation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, because plaintiff has failed to identify any discriminatory policy or practice in effect during the statutory period, he fares no better under the systemic violation theory.  Instead of \"alleg[ing] facts which would enable a jury to conclude that [he] had suffered from political discrimination in the year before [he] filed suit,\" Velazquez, 736 F.2d at 834, plaintiff has simply alleged that every time Soto carried out her position as supervisor, she resurrected a general political plot designed by defendants to harm and humiliate plaintiff.  This is not enough.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Plaintiff has failed to proffer any evidence that he was treated differently than members of parties other than the NPP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because \" 'the proper focus [in continuing violation analysis] is on the time of the discriminatory act, not the point at which the consequences of the act become painful,' \" Mack 871 F.2d at 182 (quoting Chardon v.

For example, plaintiff has not contradicted Soto's sworn statement that she denied plaintiff (and others) master keys to the Sports Complex for security reasons, that she opened plaintiff's mail because he was absent from work, or that her assignment of plaintiff's duties mirrored his job description as set forth in his personnel form.  Moreover, plaintiff alleged that Soto represented herself as the \"Director\" of the Sports Complex on letters dated December 4, 1991 and May 28, 1992.  A review of the letters shows that Soto signed \"Dr. Soto, Director.\"   At the time Soto signed these letters, she was the Director of the Physical Education Department</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff's evidence of discriminatory animus consists of the following:</p>\n        <p>Close to the date in which Carlos Romero Barcelo lost the elections [November 1984], Dr. Karen Soto came to me and asked me what was I going to do now that the New Progressive Party had lost.</p>\n        <p>Plaintiff has neglected to show how this dated and inconclusive statement evidences a policy of discrimination which continued into the limitations period, or how it could support \"a finding that [plaintiff was] treated differently than [he] would have been treated had [he] belonged to [defendants'] political part[ies].\"  Id. at 836.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff further contends that because the original reorganization was illegal, any fallout from the merger constituted an independent act of demotion.  We are not persuaded.  Under plaintiff's novel theory, any demoted employee with a potential cause of action could wait an indefinite period of time before bringing a Sec. 1983 action because every day s/he went to work, s/he was affected.  This is absurd.  Statute of limitations are designed to keep stale claims out of court.  See Havens Realty Corp. v.
