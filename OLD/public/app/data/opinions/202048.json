This multi-issue appeal arose out\n\nof what ought to have been a straightforward contract dispute\n\nbrought in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\n\n                Plaintiffs Paul Platten, Thomas Flannery, and Bruce Pfau,\n\nwho are former partners of HG (Bermuda) Exempted Partnership\n\n(\"Partnership\"),          allege   that     the   Partnership   illegitimately\n\nwithheld termination distributions the three men believed they were\n\nowed       by   falsely   claiming   that    they   had   violated   their   non-\n\ncompetition obligations.             In seeking redress for this alleged\n\nwrong, plaintiffs could have brought their contract claims against\n\nthe Partnership's successor-in-interest, HG (Bermuda) Limited (\"HG\n\nLimited\"),1 in Bermuda, where HG Limited was organized and has its\n\nusual place of business and in accordance with whose laws the\n\nparties agreed to settle their contract disputes.                Instead, they\n\nsought to reach HG Limited in Massachusetts.              To do so, they had to\n\nbring in a number of other defendants -- who were not parties to\n\nthe agreement -- under close to a dozen tenuous legal theories.               As\n\na result, we discuss the Massachusetts law of breach of contract,\n\ncivil conspiracy, and negligent misrepresentation, as well as seven\n\nother state and federal claims.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          The Partnership dissolved and was reconstituted in 2000\nas HG Limited, which plaintiffs incorrectly identify in their\ncomplaint as \"HG Bermuda Exempted Limited.\" The parties agree that\nthe Partnership no longer exists, so we treat it as the same entity\nas HG Limited for the purpose of this litigation.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f          The    district      court    dismissed    plaintiffs'    action   on\n\nvarious grounds: for some claims, failure to establish personal\n\njurisdiction, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), and for others, failure\n\nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted, see Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(b)(6).    We affirm, concluding that plaintiffs have stated no\n\nclaims against the corporate parties as to whom there may be\n\npersonal jurisdiction in Massachusetts. As to the one other entity\n\nagainst which plaintiffs do state claims, plaintiffs did not meet\n\ntheir burden of proving that there is personal jurisdiction over\n\nthe relevant defendant in Massachusetts, as there would have been\n\nin Bermuda.\n\n                                        I.\n\n          We    recite   the    facts    as   they   appear   in   plaintiffs'\n\noriginal verified complaint and in their subsequent affidavits that\n\nwere admitted into the record by the district court.               See Daynard\n\nv. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson & Poole, P.A., 290 F.3d 42,\n\n45 (1st Cir. 2002); Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar\n\nAss'n, 142 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir. 1998).          We also describe briefly,\n\nwhere relevant, defendants' competing factual allegations, but rely\n\non them only to the extent that they are uncontradicted.                 Mass.\n\nSch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 34.\n\nA.        Background\n\n          Plaintiffs     Platten,       Flannery,    and   Pfau    are   former\n\nemployees of Hay Group Inc. (\"HGI\"), an international consulting\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fbusiness incorporated in Pennsylvania.2                 HGI is a wholly owned\n\nsubsidiary of Hay Acquisition Company I, Inc. (\"Hay Acquisition\"),\n\na Delaware corporation. In turn, Hay Acquisition is a wholly owned\n\nsubsidiary of Hay Group Investment Holding B.V. (\"Hay BV\"), a\n\nNetherlands corporation, which itself is a wholly owned subsidiary\n\nof HG Limited, a Bermudan corporation.\n\n           Plaintiffs allege that the five corporations, together\n\nwith Chris Matthews, operated as an \"association-in-fact\" known as\n\nthe \"Hay Group,\" in which the operations of the corporations and\n\nthe Partnership were intermingled and controlled by Matthews.\n\nMatthews was the Chief Executive Partner of the Partnership and\n\nbecame   the    Chief   Executive     Officer      of    HG   Limited    when   the\n\nPartnership was reconstituted as such in 2000.                    At all times\n\nrelevant to the litigation, Matthews was also the sole stockholder\n\nof Hay BV, the Chairman of the Board and President of HGI, and the\n\nChairman   of    the    Board   and   Chief     Executive      Officer    of    Hay\n\nAcquisition.\n\n           Platten      was   hired   in    1989    as    a   Senior    Executive\n\nCompensation Consultant in HGI's Boston office. He was promoted in\n\n1990 to Manager of that office and in 1998 to East Operations\n\nDirector, a position that he held until it was eliminated, and his\n\nemployment with HGI terminated, in 1999.                 In 1997, Platten also\n\nbecame a member of the Partnership Management Committee.                   During\n\n     2\n          Defendants Hay Acquisition and HGI allege that HGI is\nactually a Delaware corporation.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe entirety of his tenure at HGI, Platten worked out of the Boston\n\noffice, where he received, often by phone and at least twice in\n\nperson, directions from Matthews about both HGI and Partnership\n\nbusiness.\n\n            Co-plaintiff Flannery was hired in 1981 as an Associate\n\nin the Chicago office of HGI. He subsequently transferred to other\n\nHGI   offices,   including       those   in    Kansas    City,    St.   Louis,    and\n\nSingapore, where he served in various capacities, including as\n\nGeneral Manager.     He was based in HGI's Dallas office at the time\n\nhe left the consulting practice voluntarily in 1999.\n\n            The third plaintiff, Pfau, was hired in 1990 as a Senior\n\nConsultant in HGI's New York office and was eventually promoted to\n\nManaging Director of the Research for Management division.                        His\n\nemployment with HGI, which was based solely in New York, terminated\n\nvoluntarily by agreement in 1999.\n\n            During   the     course      of    their    employment        with    HGI,\n\nplaintiffs were each required to enter into a partnership agreement\n\n(\"Agreement\")    with      the    Partnership.          Neither     HGI     nor   Hay\n\nAcquisition was a party to the Agreement; the Agreement itself says\n\nthat it was made \"by and among\" the initial and continuing partners\n\nof the Partnership.         The Agreement specifies that Bermuda law\n\ngoverns its interpretation and enforcement.\n\n            By the terms of the Agreement, all partners, including\n\nthe   plaintiffs,     were       required      to      make   periodic       capital\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fcontributions to the Partnership.          Upon termination of employment\n\nand absent some other agreement between the parties, a partner was\n\nentitled,     on   the   third   anniversary     of    withdrawal   from   the\n\nPartnership, to a termination distribution comprised of the sum of\n\nthe partner's capital contributions and his share of Partnership\n\nassets. The distribution did not have to be paid in full, however,\n\nif Matthews and the Partnership Management Committee determined\n\nthat the partner had been terminated for cause or (most relevant\n\nhere) that the partner's termination was \"accompanied by\" the\n\nviolation of the Agreement's non-competition clause.                 In that\n\nevent, the partner's termination distribution could be reduced to\n\nthe amount of his capital contributions and paid out over a five-\n\nyear period from the date of termination.             It is this provision of\n\nthe Agreement that is at the center of this dispute.\n\n             After leaving HGI, plaintiffs accepted employment with\n\nother consulting groups -- Platten with the Boston office of\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, and then with the Boston office of\n\nWatson Wyatt & Company; Flannery with the Boston office of Arthur\n\nAnderson, LLP; and Pfau with the New York office of Watson Wyatt &\n\nCompany.     Each plaintiff maintains that his actions after leaving\n\nHGI   were     consistent    with    the    Agreement's      non-competition\n\nobligations.\n\n             In 2002, each plaintiff made written inquiries to HG\n\nLimited,     the   Partnership's    successor,    about     his   termination\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdistribution.     In turn, each received, among other correspondence\n\nfrom HG Limited, a September 4, 2002 letter signed by Matthews.\n\nThe letter stated that a former partner's termination distribution\n\nwas tethered to his non-competition obligations and asked each\n\nrecipient   to    prove     that   he   was    not    in   violation   of   those\n\nobligations.     Each plaintiff responded by letter that he had not\n\nbroken the non-competition clause.            On September 26, 2002, counsel\n\nfor HG Limited informed each plaintiff in writing that he was not\n\nentitled to the immediate and full payment of his termination\n\ndistribution because he had failed to respect the non-competition\n\nclause.\n\n            Plaintiffs allege that except with regard to termination\n\ndistributions, merely working for another consulting group was\n\ngenerally not considered by the \"Hay Group\" to be a violation of a\n\npartner's non-competition agreement.                 They further allege that\n\naccusing them of violating their non-competition obligations was\n\nmerely a tactic the Partnership used to wrongfully deny them their\n\ntermination distributions.         Matthews, they maintain, orchestrated\n\nthis   scheme    to   the   benefit     of    the    existing   partners,   whose\n\npartnership bonuses would increase as less money was being paid out\n\nto their former colleagues.           Plaintiffs allege that the benefits\n\nwould also trickle down to the \"Hay Group\" entities, including HGI\n\nand Hay Acquisition, which would have more available cash and a\n\nreduced need for borrowing to fund their operations.\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fB.          Relevant Procedural History\n\n            Plaintiffs brought suit in the Superior Court for Suffolk\n\nCounty, Massachusetts, on June 19, 2003.              In addition to the\n\nPartnership and its successor-in-interest, HG Limited, plaintiffs\n\nnamed three other corporate defendants -- Hay BV, Hay Acquisition,\n\nand HGI -- and one individual defendant, Chris Matthews.\n\n            Plaintiffs asserted a total of eleven counts in their\n\ncomplaint.    Against all defendants, plaintiffs claimed breach of\n\ncontract,    breach   of   implied   covenant   of   good   faith   and   fair\n\ndealing, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of\n\nfiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, unfair and deceptive practices,\n\ncivil conspiracy, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and\n\nCorrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-68. Plaintiffs\n\nalso asserted a claim of interference with contractual relations\n\nagainst Hay BV, Hay Acquisition, and HGI.\n\n            Along with their verified complaint, plaintiffs filed an\n\nex parte motion for an attachment on trustee process of the goods,\n\neffects, or credits of the defendants in the amount of $843,329,\n\nthe sum of the termination distributions that plaintiffs claimed\n\nwere due. Finding \"a reasonable lik[e]lihood that the plaintiff[s]\n\nwill recover judgment,\" the superior court granted the motion and\n\nissued an ex parte order of attachment.          Plaintiffs subsequently\n\nmoved for a preliminary injunction, requesting an additional double\n\nof that amount because of the mandatory treble damages provided\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\funder the RICO statute.           This motion was denied by the court on\n\nJune 25, 2003.\n\n           The defendants removed the action on July 15, 2003 to the\n\nMassachusetts federal district court on the basis of complete\n\ndiversity of the parties and, as to the RICO Act claim, federal\n\nquestion jurisdiction.         On August 8, 2003, Hay Acquisition and HGI\n\n(\"Domestic Defendants\") filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).       The district court on June 16, 2004 granted\n\nthe   motion    with    respect    to   all    claims   against      the   Domestic\n\nDefendants except for three: breach of contract, breach of implied\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. On\n\nthe first two claims, the court held that, because of the choice of\n\nlaw provision in the partnership Agreement, the Domestic Defendants\n\nneeded to have shown that the claims would have been meritless\n\nunder Bermuda, not Massachusetts, law.\n\n           On    June    25,   2004,    plaintiffs      moved   to    amend   their\n\ncomplaint, seeking to restore the dismissed counts by adding\n\nallegations of fraudulent inducement that they argued would cure\n\nthe defects in their claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation,\n\nand RICO Act violation.        Their amended complaint further sought to\n\nclarify that the claims for interference with contractual relations\n\nand conspiracy were pleadings in the alternative, to be considered\n\nonly in the event that Hay Acquisition and HGI were found to be\n\nseparate entities from the Partnership.            This motion was denied as\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\ffutile by the district court on November 23, 2004.                    Plaintiffs\n\nmoved for reconsideration, which was denied on January 14, 2005.\n\n              On July 8, 2004, the Domestic Defendants moved for the\n\ncourt to reconsider its denial of the motion to dismiss with\n\nrespect to the remaining three contract claims against them.                     On\n\nDecember 21, 2004, the district court, holding that Massachusetts\n\nlaw applied after all, granted the motion for reconsideration and\n\ndismissed the breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment claims against\n\nHay Acquisition and HGI.             On December 29, 2004, the plaintiffs\n\nfiled    a    motion    for   reconsideration       of   the   dismissal   of   the\n\ncontractual relations, negligence, and civil conspiracy claims\n\nagainst Hay Acquisition and HGI, which the court denied on January\n\n13, 2005.         This left plaintiffs with no surviving claims against\n\nthe Domestic Defendants.\n\n              Meanwhile,      on    August   21,   2003,   the   Partnership, HG\n\nLimited, and Hay B.V. (\"Offshore Defendants\") filed a separate\n\nmotion       to    dismiss    for    lack    of    personal    jurisdiction     and\n\ninsufficient service of process.               See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2),\n\n(5). Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion on October 6,\n\n2003, and, after defendants filed their reply, plaintiffs moved on\n\nDecember 10, 2003 for leave to file a response and a second\n\naffidavit of Platten (\"Platten Affidavit II\").                 The district court\n\ndenied plaintiffs' motion on December 23, 2003.                   On January 23,\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f2004, plaintiffs moved for the court to reconsider its denial of\n\ntheir motion to file Platten Affidavit II; the court denied that\n\nmotion on February 18, 2004.\n\n            The    district   court   granted   the    Offshore    Defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on June 15, 2004.                  In\n\nresponse, plaintiffs moved on June 25, 2004 for the court to\n\nreconsider its dismissal of HG Limited or, in the alternative, to\n\ndefer ruling pending jurisdictional discovery.3              That motion was\n\ndenied on November 18, 2004.\n\n            On April 28, 2005, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed, with\n\nprejudice, all of their claims against Chris Matthews, the sole\n\nindividual defendant.\n\n            Plaintiffs then initiated this appeal.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            Plaintiffs challenge a number of district court rulings,\n\nincluding    the    following:   (1)    its   dismissal      of   ten   of   the\n\nplaintiffs' claims against the Domestic Defendants, Hay Acquisition\n\nand HGI, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\n\ngranted;4 (2) its refusal to admit into evidence Platten Affidavit\n\nII; (3) its dismissal of the claims against HG Limited for lack of\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          Plaintiffs did not seek reconsideration of the court's\ndismissal of Hay B.V. for lack of jurisdiction.\n     4\n          Plaintiffs do not challenge                 the   district    court's\ndismissal of their negligence claim.\n\n                                      -12-\n\fpersonal jurisdiction; and (4) its denial of plaintiffs' request\n\nfor jurisdictional discovery.\n\nA.         Rulings Pertaining to the Dismissal of Claims Against HGI\n           and Hay Acquisition\n\n           Plaintiffs first claim error in the district court's\n\ndismissal of their claims against the Domestic Defendants pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).     The crux of all the claims is that HG\n\nLimited wrongfully failed to pay plaintiffs the full amount of\n\ntheir termination distributions and that, as a result, liability\n\ncan be imposed upon Hay Acquisition and HGI, which are its third-\n\nand fourth-tier subsidiaries, respectively.\n\n           We review de novo and may affirm on any ground supported\n\nby the record.     See Diva's Inc. v. City of Bangor, 411 F.3d 30, 40,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 2005).       We accept as true all well-pleaded facts\n\nalleged by plaintiffs in their complaint and draw in their favor\n\nall   reasonable    inferences   fitting   their   stated   theories   of\n\nliability.   See Morales-Villalobos v. Garcia-Llorens, 316 F.3d 51,\n\n52-53 (1st Cir. 2003).     \"[T]he threshold [for stating a claim] may\n\nbe low, but it is real.\"     Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513,\n\n514 (1st Cir. 1988).     Thus, plaintiffs are obliged to set forth in\n\ntheir complaint \"factual allegations, either direct or inferential,\n\nregarding each material element necessary to sustain recovery under\n\nsome actionable legal theory.\"      Id. at 515.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f              1.

They allege, however, that\n\nOffshore Defendant HG Limited, as the Partnership's successor, is\n\nbound by the Agreement; that the Domestic and Offshore Defendants\n\ncomprise a single enterprise, known as the \"Hay Group\"; that all\n\nthe organizations in the enterprise have intermingled operations\n\nand    finances;      and    that   the   entire   enterprise    is   pervasively\n\ncontrolled by Chris Matthews and the Partnership.                They thus argue\n\nthat the corporate form should be disregarded so as to allow them\n\nto hold the Domestic Defendants liable for the Partnership's, now\n\nHG Limited's, alleged misdeeds.\n\n              We apply, as did the district court and the parties,\n\nMassachusetts law.5          \"Under Massachusetts common law, disregarding\n\n       5\n          The district court initially denied the Domestic\nDefendants' motion to dismiss the breach of contract and breach of\nimplied covenant claims, on the ground that defendants neglected to\nshow that plaintiffs failed to state a claim under Bermuda law.

They further allege:\n\n          All managerial decisions, even extending to\n          the local level, were made by Matthews and the\n          Partnership Management Committee. From time\n          to time, at least twice, Matthews came to the\n          Boston office to review local financial\n\n                                    -16-\n\f          performance and to review progress on product\n          development.      He   frequently   supervised\n          performance and profitability of the Boston\n          office and other local offices acting as head\n          of U.S. operations. Matthews also regularly\n          placed telephone calls to Platten in Boston\n          wherein he would give [Platten] instructions\n          on management matters relating to the Boston\n          office and they would discuss the Boston\n          office's monthly performance, staffing issues\n          and collection efforts. The Boston office had\n          at least 100 clients located in Massachusetts.\n\nTaken as true, these allegations do not meet the standard for\n\ndisregarding the corporate form.6\n\n          The circumstances here closely track those in Birbara, 99\n\nF.3d 1233, in which we vacated a jury verdict on the ground that\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to justify piercing the corporate\n\nveil.   Here, as in Birbara, there is insufficient showing of\n\nconfused intermingling or pervasive control.          That Matthews (and\n\nPlatten) sometimes acted on behalf of the Partnership and other\n\ntimes on behalf of its subsidiaries \"is to be expected when\n\nindividuals    serve   as   directors    for   both   a   parent   and   its\n\nsubsidiary.\"    Id. at 1239-40.    Plaintiffs themselves acknowledge\n\nthat Matthews was \"acting as head of U.S. operations\" when he\n\nsupervised the Boston office's performance.           \"It is also to be\n\n\n     6    Plaintiffs make a few other allegations that go to\nMatthews' \"pervasive control\" of the \"Hay Group.\"      But, as the\ndistrict court stated, \"plaintiffs' insistence upon referring to\neach and all of the corporate defendants by the broad collective\nterm 'Hay Group' . . . makes it difficult . . . to decipher who did\nwhat and how, for the purpose of determining whether there is a\nrelationship of control, and not simply of cooperation, among the\nHay entities.\"\n\n                                  -17-\n\fexpected      that     when   a   subsidiary     company     profits,    the   parent\n\ncompany\" -- in this case, the Partnership and its partners -- \"will\n\nas well.\"          Id. at 1240.\n\n               Despite their allegations of intermingling, plaintiffs\n\nhave never alleged that they were confused about the identity of\n\nthe legal entity with which they were contracting.7                      Indeed, the\n\nallegations are insufficient to show any \"fraudulent or injurious\n\nconsequence of the intercorporate relationship.\"                        Id. at 1238\n\n(quoting My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at 752).                  \"Plaintiffs were never\n\nmisled about which corporate entity . . . was obligated to them or\n\nwas dealing with them.\"            Id. at 1240.    They acknowledged that their\n\nAgreement was with the Partnership and clearly understood that the\n\nPartnership was responsible for the payment of the distributions.\n\nIn fact, Platten was once a member of the Partnership Management\n\nCommittee that oversaw the distribution payment scheme.\n\n               Ultimately,        plaintiffs      do   not     allege,     and   the\n\ncircumstances do not lead to an inference of, any gross inequity\n\nthat       would    argue   in    favor   of   overriding    the   presumption     of\n\n\n       7\n          Defendants argue that Massachusetts courts do not pierce\nthe corporate veil in contract cases, \"because the parties to\ncontractual relationships choose with whom to deal and can protect\nthemselves through bargaining.\"    See Birbara, 99 F.3d at 1238\n(noting that \"[w]e have found no Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\nCourt case applying the veil piercing doctrine in a contract case\"\nand that some courts and commentators have declined to apply the\ncorporate disregard doctrine in contract cases, but declining\nultimately to resolve the issue). To resolve this case, we need\nnot decide the availability of the corporate disregard doctrine in\nMassachusetts contract cases.\n\n                                          -18-\n\fcorporate separateness.    See Commonwealth v. Beneficial Fin. Co.,\n\n275 N.E.2d 33, 91 (Mass. 1971) (courts will only look through the\n\ncorporate veil to \"accomplish . . . essential justice\"); My Bread,\n\n233 N.E.2d at 752 (limiting the application of the corporate\n\ndisregard doctrine only to \"rare particular situations in order to\n\nprevent   gross   inequity\");   see   also     Birbara,   99   F.3d    at   1239\n\n(collecting sources).      Plaintiffs would not have been in the\n\nposition they are in now if they had sought relief directly from HG\n\nLimited by suing it in Bermuda.       Mere inconvenience is simply not\n\na sufficient ground for disregarding the corporate form.\n\n           Since Hay Acquisition and HGI are entities separate from\n\nHG Limited and are not parties to the Agreement, they cannot be\n\nheld liable for breach of contract.8           \"Having concluded that no\n\ncontract exists, there can be no derivative implied covenant of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing applicable to these parties.\"                   Mass.\n\nEye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., 412 F.3d 215,\n\n229 (1st Cir. 2005).       Also, because the allegations are not\n\nsufficient to show that they were beneficiaries to the contract,\n\nthe   Domestic    Defendants    cannot    be    held   liable    for    unjust\n\n      8\n           Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in\nfailing to follow the law of the case as established by the\nMassachusetts Superior Court, which had determined, in granting\nplaintiffs' ex parte order of attachment, that there was \"a\nreasonable lik[e]lihood that the plaintiff[s] will recover\njudgment\" on their breach of contract claim. The law of the case\ndoctrine, however, does not apply to tentative or preliminary\nrulings. See Harlow v. Children's Hosp., 432 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.\n2005) (noting that interlocutory orders do not constitute law of\nthe case).\n\n                                   -19-\n\fenrichment.       In    any   event,   Massachusetts       law   does    not   allow\n\nlitigants   to    override     an   express     contract    by   arguing       unjust\n\nenrichment.      See, e.g., Zarum v. Brass Mill Materials Corp., 134\n\nN.E.2d 141, 143 (Mass. 1956) (\"The law will not imply a contract\n\nwhere there is an existing express contract covering the same\n\nsubject matter.\").        We affirm the district court's dismissal of\n\nthese three claims against the Domestic Defendants.\n\n            2.         Dismissal   of  Interference   with   Contractual\n                       Relations and Civil Conspiracy Claims\n\n            Plaintiffs next contest the district court's dismissal of\n\ntheir claims against HGI and Hay Acquisition for interference with\n\ncontractual relations and civil conspiracy.\n\n            We dispose first of plaintiffs' tortious interference\n\nclaim.   Under    Massachusetts        common   law,   \"[i]n     an     action   for\n\nintentional interference with contractual relations, the plaintiff\n\nmust prove that: (1) he had a contract with a third party; (2) the\n\ndefendant knowingly induced the third party to break that contract;\n\n(3) the defendant's interference, in addition to being intentional,\n\nwas improper in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed\n\nby the defendant's actions.\"              G.S. Enters., Inc. v. Falmouth\n\nMarine, Inc., 571 N.E.2d 1363, 1369-70 (Mass. 1991) (citing United\n\nTruck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman, 551 N.E.2d 20, 21 (Mass. 1990)).\n\n            Plaintiffs' principal argument on appeal is that the\n\nDomestic Defendants, \"by and through Matthews, took actions which\n\ninduced the Partnership to break the Agreement.\"                  In support of\n\n                                       -20-\n\fthis theory, they rely on nothing more than conclusory allegations\n\nthat Matthews controlled the various \"Hay Group\" entities, that he\n\nacted with improper motives to retain income for himself and the\n\n\"Hay Group,\" and that he knew, or should have known, that the\n\nplaintiffs'   termination   distributions   could   not   be   rightfully\n\nwithheld.     Taking these allegations as true, plaintiffs still\n\ncannot make out a claim for interference of contract against the\n\nDomestic Defendants based on their theory of liability.\n\n            Under Massachusetts law, in evaluating \"whether the acts\n\nand intent of natural persons, be they officers, directors or\n\nemployees, can be treated as the acts and intent of the corporation\n\nitself,\" Beneficial Fin., 275 N.E.2d at 77, a court must examine\n\nwhether those natural persons have \"been vested with the authority\n\nto act on behalf of the corporation in the sphere of corporate\n\nbusiness in which he commits the [alleged wrongful] act,\" id. at 80\n\n(applying this test to a question of criminal liability, but\n\nderiving the test from civil and criminal cases). The record lacks\n\nany allegation or fact by which a reasonable inference can be drawn\n\nthat Matthews was acting in the capacity and within the authority\n\nof his positions at Hay Acquisition and HGI when he allegedly\n\n\"interfered\" with the Partnership's contractual relationship with\n\nthe plaintiffs.    See, e.g., Stoneman v. Fox Film Corp., 4 N.E.2d\n\n63, 66 (Mass. 1936) (noting that the president of a corporation\n\n\"has not unlimited power but is restricted to doing those things\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fwhich are usual and necessary in the ordinary course of the\n\ncorporate         business,\"      and    holding      that,    where   the    president\n\ncommitted wrongs while acting beyond the scope of his authority,\n\nthe corporation is not civilly liable for resulting injuries).\n\nMoreover, as the district court intimated, plaintiffs essentially\n\nwere hoisted by their own petard: crediting their allegation that\n\nall the \"Hay Group\" entities constituted one enterprise, \"it seems\n\nthat       the   plaintiffs      seek    to    hold   the     defendants     liable   for\n\ninterfering with their own contract\"; \"[t]here is no such tort.\"9\n\n                 Similar problems beleaguer plaintiffs' civil conspiracy\n\nclaim.       They allege that Matthews \"organized and orchestrated\" a\n\nscheme by which employees of HGI would be invited to join the\n\nPartnership, required to make substantial capital contributions\n\nwith       promises     of     payment    of    termination      distributions,       and\n\nsubsequently          denied     their    distributions        by   false    claims    of\n\nviolations of the non-competition obligations.\n\n                 \"For liability to attach on this basis, there must be,\n\nfirst, a common design or an agreement, although not necessarily\n\nexpress, between two or more persons to do a wrongful act and,\n\n\n       9\n          Plaintiffs argue that the court cannot decide that the\ndefendants constitute one entity in dismissing plaintiffs'\ninterference and conspiracy claims, while refusing to treat them as\none entity in dismissing plaintiffs' contract claims. But there is\nnothing inconsistent about the court's reasoning: the court\nevaluated the pleading requirements particular to each claim,\nincluding the heightened pleading requirements attendant to the\ncorporate disregard doctrine, and concluded that plaintiffs failed\nto meet them.\n\n                                              -22-\n\fsecond,   proof    of   some   tortious    act   in   furtherance    of   the\n\nagreement.\"     Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. v. P & B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546,\n\n1564 (1st Cir. 1994).          Plaintiffs make no factual allegations\n\nsupporting the conclusion that the Domestic Defendants engaged in\n\na common design or agreement with the Partnership to do a wrongful\n\nact; to the contrary, plaintiffs' allegation is that all the\n\ndefendants comprise a single corporate enterprise.                  No civil\n\nconspiracy claim can lie under plaintiffs' theory because an entity\n\ncannot conspire with itself.       There is also a risk in plaintiffs'\n\nargument of confusing a family relationship among corporations with\n\na conspiracy; all that is shown here is a family relationship, and\n\nthat is insufficient on its own to support a conspiracy claim.            Cf.\n\nGilbuilt Homes, Inc. v. Cont'l Homes of New Eng., 667 F.2d 209, 210\n\n(1st Cir. 1981) (holding that \"a vague reference to 'inter-family\n\nrelationships'\" was not enough to state a claim for conspiracy\n\nunder Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1).          The district\n\ncourt properly dismissed the civil conspiracy claim.\n\n           3.       Dismissal of Fraud, Negligent Misrepresentation,\n                    and RICO Act Claims\n\n           Plaintiffs contest the district court's dismissal of\n\ntheir fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and civil RICO Act claims\n\nagainst the Domestic Defendants.\n\n           The district court dismissed the three claims on the\n\nground that plaintiffs failed to allege that they relied on the\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation or that their injuries stemmed from\n\n                                    -23-\n\fsuch reliance.    On appeal, plaintiffs essentially concede that at\n\nthe time the district court considered the claims, they had not\n\nmade allegations sufficient to support them.     They suggest that\n\ntheir success on appeal turns on the outcome of our review of the\n\ndistrict court's November 23, 2004 denial of plaintiffs' motion to\n\namend their complaint to cure acknowledged deficiencies in their\n\noriginal pleadings.    Plaintiffs attached a copy of their proposed\n\namended complaint to that motion; the court determined the motion\n\nwas futile.\n\n          We review the denial of a motion to amend for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.      See Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth, & Their\n\nFamilies, 274 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2001).    Within that standard,\n\npure questions of law are reviewed de novo.        Since denial of\n\nplaintiffs' motion as futile would be appropriate if the amended\n\ncomplaint still failed to state a claim sufficient to survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss, our review in this instance is, for practical\n\npurposes, identical to review of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal based on\n\nthe allegations in the amended complaint.    See id.\n\n          Under Massachusetts law, to make out a claim for fraud,\n\nplaintiffs must show that the Domestic Defendants made a false\n\nrepresentation of a material fact with knowledge of its falsity for\n\npurposes of inducing the plaintiff to act thereon, and that the\n\nplaintiff actually relied on the representation.       See Slaney v.\n\nWestwood Auto, Inc., 322 N.E.2d 768, 779 (Mass. 1975).   For a claim\n\n\n                                -24-\n\ffor   misrepresentation,    plaintiffs    must   demonstrate    that    the\n\nDomestic Defendants (1) made false statements of material fact (2)\n\nto induce plaintiffs to enter into the Agreement, and (3) that they\n\nreasonably relied on those statements to their detriment.               See\n\nRodowicz v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 192 F.3d 162, 175 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (citing Zimmerman v. Kent, 575 N.E.2d 70, 74 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1991)).   Both causes of action, then, require plaintiffs' reliance\n\non defendants' representations.\n\n           In their proposed amended complaint, plaintiffs alleged\n\nthat they were \"induced to enter into the Agreement by [certain]\n\nrepresentations made in the Agreement,\" and that two individuals,\n\nKen Martin and Jim Williams -- each of whom was a partner in the\n\nPartnership -- made \"representations\" in person or by phone as to\n\nthe meaning of the non-competition provision of the Agreement.\n\n           These allegations do not suffice to hold Hay Acquisition\n\nand HGI liable for the fraud and misrepresentation claims.            After\n\nall, plaintiffs did not allege any justified reliance on the\n\nmisrepresentations.    In fact, they stated that they entered into\n\nthe Agreement because it was \"a condition of employment with the\n\nHay   Group.\"   And,   as   the   district   court   pointed   out,    their\n\ncomplaint states that they continued to demand their termination\n\ndistributions even after some of the alleged misrepresentations\n\nwere made.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f          As      to   the   civil    RICO     Act    claim,    it   fails    because\n\nplaintiffs    never     alleged      proximate       cause    between   defendants'\n\nwrongful conduct and plaintiffs' injuries.                   As the district court\n\nobserved, even if the Domestic Defendants can be held responsible\n\nfor misrepresentations by mail or wire, plaintiffs did not rely on\n\nthose misrepresentations.            Therefore, their injuries, if proven,\n\ncome not from those misrepresentations, but from HG Limited's\n\nalleged breach of the Agreement by failing to pay the three men\n\ntheir termination distributions.

Subaru of New Eng., Inc., 393 F.3d 36, 51 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(\"Section 1964(c) of [18 U.S.C.] requires that the defendant's\n\nspecified acts of racketeering were the proximate cause of the\n\nplaintiffs' injuries.\").\n\n          Because the allegations in plaintiffs' proposed amended\n\ncomplaint would have been insufficient to make out fraud, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation,       and   RICO     Act    claims    against     the     Domestic\n\nDefendants, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying the motion to amend the complaint as futile.                    Nor did the\n\ndistrict court err in dismissing the underlying substantive claims\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n             4.    Dismissal of Plaintiffs' Remaining Claims Against\n                   the Domestic Defendants\n\n          The remainder of plaintiffs' claims against the Domestic\n\nDefendants are plainly meritless, and we quickly dispose of them.\n\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\f            Plaintiffs     argue    that        the    district      court   erred     in\n\ndismissing the plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claims against\n\nthe Domestic Defendants.            They suggest that the Partnership's\n\nfiduciary duty should be extended to HGI and Hay Acquisition, \"on\n\nwhose behalf Matthews acted.\"             This agency theory fails for the\n\nreasons articulated above. The district court correctly determined\n\nthat    \"plaintiffs     have    alleged     no    [independent]          source   of    a\n\nfiduciary duty as to these defendants\" and the claim thus fails as\n\na matter of pleading.\n\n            Plaintiffs also contest the district court's dismissal of\n\ntheir claim under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 11, which provides for\n\na cause of action against any \"unfair method of competition or\n\n. . . unfair or deceptive act or practice\" in the conduct of \"any\n\ntrade or commerce.\"      The theory of liability for this claim is the\n\nsame as that underlying plaintiffs' misrepresentation claim, and\n\nthe theory fails for the same reason the misrepresentation claim\n\nfails.    Additionally, as the district court concluded, the alleged\n\nmisrepresentations made by defendants did not arise out of any\n\n\"trade or commerce\" and thus do not fall within the purview of the\n\nstatute.     See Linkage Corp. v. Trs. of Boston Univ., 679 N.E.2d\n\n191, 207 n.33 (Mass. 1997) (noting that the statute does not extend\n\nto     \"intra-enterprise       disputes,\"        such     as     \"disputes    between\n\nindividual    members    of    a   partnership         arising    from    partnership\n\nbusiness,\"    \"because     they    are    more        similar   to   purely   private\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fdisputes and are not 'commercial transaction[s]'\" (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Szalla v. Locke, 657 N.E.2d 1267, 1269 (Mass.\n\n1995))).\n\nB.         Rulings Relating to Lack of Personal Jurisdiction over HG\n           Limited\n\n           We also affirm the court's rulings with respect to HG\n\nLimited, the sole Offshore Defendant remaining in the case.\n\n           1.      Exclusion of Platten Affidavit II\n\n           Plaintiffs    argue   that     the   district   court   erred    in\n\nrefusing   to   admit   into   evidence    Platten   Affidavit     II.     The\n\nplaintiffs had argued to the court that Platten Affidavit II, which\n\nsupplemented Platten's initial affidavit, should be admitted to\n\ncounter certain \"misrepresentations of fact\" purportedly made by\n\nthe Offshore Defendants in their motion to dismiss for lack of\n\npersonal jurisdiction.\n\n           We review district court rulings pertaining to motions\n\nfor reconsideration for abuse of discretion, see United States v.\n\nOne Lot of U.S. Currency ($36,634), 103 F.3d 1048, 1050 (1st Cir.\n\n1997), and find none here. Plaintiffs sought leave to file Platten\n\nAffidavit II on December 10, 2003, nearly two months after they\n\nfiled their opposition to the Offshore Defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction.         By that time, they had already\n\nasked for leave to submit a second affidavit of Bruce Pfau, which\n\nthe district court subsequently granted.           The court was under no\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\fobligation to continue to allow plaintiffs to make piecemeal\n\ncorrections to their pleadings.\n\n          Plaintiffs   argue   that,    in   light   of   an   intervening\n\nIllinois decision, see Joy v. Hay Group, Inc., No. 02-C-4989, 2003\n\nWL 22118930 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 11, 2003), which they claim is\n\nfavorable to them, the district court should have given them the\n\nopportunity, through the affidavit, to revise their pleadings to\n\ninclude additional factual allegations.        But they admit that the\n\nfacts they sought to add were in existence at the time they filed\n\ntheir original opposition.     That they did not see the need for a\n\nfuller factual presentation when they were required to respond does\n\nnot rescue their case.   The district court was more than fair in\n\nits handling of the case.10\n\n          2.     Lack of Personal Jurisdiction over HG Limited\n\n          Plaintiffs also claim error in the district court's\n\ndismissal of HG Limited, the Partnership's successor-in-interest,\n\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\n\n     10\n          Plaintiffs eventually submitted to the district court, in\nconjunction with their June 25, 2004 motion for reconsideration of\nthe court's dismissal of HG Limited for want of personal\njurisdiction, a third, and more comprehensive, Platten affidavit\n(\"Platten Affidavit III\"). This affidavit was belatedly filed, and\nit was the district court's prerogative whether to consider it.\nThe district court made no reference to it when it summarily denied\nthe motion for reconsideration. Given the court's silence and its\nearlier refusal to consider Platten Affidavit II, we believe the\ncourt did not allow Platten's third affidavit. See One Lot of U.S.\nCurrency, 103 F.3d at 1050. Plaintiffs concede as much in their\nreply brief. We do not consider it.\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\f           Plaintiffs   assert   two   bases   for    exercising    personal\n\njurisdiction over HG Limited.      Their first argument is that the\n\ncourt may exercise specific jurisdiction based on HG Limited's\n\nassumption of the Partnership's obligations under the Agreement.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that specific jurisdiction over HG Limited exists\n\nunder subsections (a), (c), and (d) of the Massachusetts long-arm\n\nstatute.   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, § 3.             The state long-arm\n\nstatute states, in relevant part:\n\n           A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a\n           person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a\n           cause of action in law or equity arising from the\n           person's\n\n                (a)   transacting   any  business in  this\n                commonwealth;\n                . . . .\n                (c) causing tortious injury by an act or\n                omission in this commonwealth;\n                (d)   causing   tortious   injury in  this\n                commonwealth by an act or omission outside\n                this commonwealth if he regularly does or\n                solicits business, or engages in any other\n                persistent course of conduct, or derives\n                substantial revenue from goods used or\n                consumed or services rendered, in this\n                commonwealth . . . .\n\nId.   Plaintiffs'   second   argument    is    that    there   is    general\n\njurisdiction over HG Limited by virtue of its relationship with\n\nHGI, which itself has sufficient contacts in Massachusetts to be\n\nhailed into federal court in this state.\n\n           The district court found that neither jurisdictional\n\ntheory had sufficient factual support to carry the day.             We review\n\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\fthose conclusions of law de novo, see Harlow v. Children's Hosp.,\n\n432 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. 2005), and affirm.\n\n             The district court analyzed plaintiffs' jurisdictional\n\nclaim under the prima facie standard of Boit v. Gar-Tec Products,\n\nInc., 967 F.2d 671 (1st Cir. 1992).                See id. at 675. Under that\n\nstandard, \"plaintiff[s] ultimately bear[] the burden of persuading\n\nthe court that jurisdiction exists.\"               Mass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d\n\nat 34.      \"[P]laintiffs may not rely on unsupported allegations in\n\ntheir pleadings,\" Boit, 967 F.2d at 675, but are \"obliged to adduce\n\nevidence of specific facts,\" Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &\n\nWilcox Can., 46 F.3d 138, 145 (1st Cir. 1995).                   We, in turn, take\n\nthose \"specific facts affirmatively alleged by the plaintiff[s] as\n\ntrue . . . and construe them in the light most congenial to the\n\nplaintiff[s'] jurisdictional claim.\"               Mass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d\n\nat    34.    We   also    \"add    to   the   mix   facts   put    forward   by    the\n\ndefendants, to the extent that they are uncontradicted.\"                    Id.\n\n             To establish personal jurisdiction, plaintiffs must show\n\nthat jurisdiction is both statutorily authorized and consistent\n\nwith the Constitution.           See Daynard, 290 F.3d at 52.         The Supreme\n\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts has interpreted the state's long-\n\narm    statute    as     coextensive     with      the   outer    limits    of    the\n\nConstitution, id. (citing \"Automatic\" Sprinkler Corp. of Am. v.\n\nSeneca Foods Corp., 280 N.E. 2d 423, 424 (Mass. 1972)); thus, the\n\nonly inquiry that remains is the constitutional one, see Sawtelle\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fv. Farrell, 70 F.3d 1381, 1388 (1st Cir. 1995).           Specifically, the\n\nquestion here is whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment allows Massachusetts to exercise personal jurisdiction\n\nover HG Limited.\n\n            For the answer to this question to be yes, a defendant\n\nmust have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state \"such\n\nthat maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions\n\nof   fair   play   and   substantial     justice.'\"     Int'l   Shoe   Co.    v.\n\nWashington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer,\n\n311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)).        The \"minimum contacts\" standard has\n\nthree requirements:\n\n            For specific jurisdiction, the plaintiff's\n            claim must be related to the defendant's\n            contacts. For general jurisdiction, in which\n            the cause of action may be unrelated to the\n            defendant's contacts, the defendant must have\n            continuous and systematic contacts with the\n            state.   Second,    for   either    type   of\n            jurisdiction, the defendant's contacts with\n            the state must be purposeful. And third, the\n            exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable\n            under the circumstances.\n\nHarlow, 432 F.3d at 57; see also Cambridge Literary Props. Ltd. v.\n\nW. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. & Co. Kg., 295 F.3d 59, 63 (1st\n\nCir. 2002); Noonan v. Winston Co., 135 F.3d 85, 89 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                    a.     Plaintiffs' Claims of Specific Jurisdiction\n\n            Plaintiffs    argue   that    specific    jurisdiction     over   HG\n\nLimited exists with respect to both their contract and tort claims.\n\n            \"For specific jurisdiction, this circuit divides the\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\fconstitutional         analysis      into        three     categories:      relatedness,\n\npurposeful availment, and reasonableness.\"                     Daynard, 290 F.3d at\n\n60.     \"For its contract claim[s], . . .

Bacardi & Co., 298 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(quoting    Daynard,         290   F.3d     at    52).      \"For     its    tort   claims,\n\n[plaintiffs] must show a sufficient 'causal nexus' between [HG\n\nLimited's] contacts with [Massachusetts] and [plaintiffs'] causes\n\nof action.\"      Id. (quoting Phillips Exeter Acad. v. Howard Phillips\n\nFund, 196 F.3d 284, 289 (1st Cir.1999)).\n\n                        i.     Specific Jurisdiction over Contract Claims\n\n               Plaintiffs' primary theory of specific jurisdiction is\n\nthat their breach of contract claim arises from HG Limited's\n\nassumption of the Partnership's obligations under the Agreement,\n\nwhich    one    of    the    plaintiffs          entered    into    in     Massachusetts.\n\nSpecifically, plaintiffs contend that there is sufficient evidence\n\nin the record to support the propositions that the Partnership\n\nsolicited Platten to become a partner in Massachusetts, that the\n\nAgreement      was    executed       in    Massachusetts,          and   that    Platten's\n\nperformance          under     the        Agreement        occurred        primarily    in\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -33-\n\f            HG Limited, in turn, counters that it has its principal\n\nplace of business in Bermuda; maintains its books, records, and\n\naccounts in Bermuda; and pays taxes in Bermuda.               Moreover, it\n\nmaintains    that   it   has   never   attempted   to   solicit   or   service\n\ncustomers in Massachusetts or to derive substantial revenue from\n\nservices rendered in the state. As a holding company, it exercises\n\nonly limited control over HGI, \"a fourth-tier subsidiary,\" which\n\nhas an office in, among other places, Massachusetts.\n\n            We assume for present purposes that HG Limited fully\n\nassumed     the   Partnership's    obligations     under    the   Agreement.\n\nNonetheless, we hold, as did the district court, that the record\n\nlacks support for plaintiffs' allegations that the Partnership\n\nestablished sufficient minimum contacts in Massachusetts to be\n\nsubject to suit by plaintiffs in this state.             Our inquiry begins\n\nand ends with the first prong of the constitutional inquiry, that\n\nof relatedness.\n\n            In support of specific jurisdiction over their contract\n\nclaims, plaintiffs rely almost solely on the affidavits of Paul\n\nPlatten.     The first of those affidavits, and the only Platten\n\naffidavit admitted into the record, makes the following relevant\n\nallegations:\n\n            2. In February, 1989, I was hired by the\n            defendant [HGI] with the Boston Office . . . .\n\n            7. As a condition of employment with the Hay\n            Group, I was required to become a partner in\n            the Partnership and, in or about 1992, in\n\n                                       -34-\n\f            Massachusetts, I entered into an Agreement\n            . . . with the Partnership . . . .\n\n            Aside    from    these       allegations,      plaintiffs      provide   no\n\nadditional     details       about        the     place    and     circumstances     of\n\ncontracting.        Flannery and Pfau's affidavits are silent with\n\nrespect to the place of contracting, and neither of the two has\n\never claimed that their agreements with the Partnership were signed\n\nor executed in Massachusetts.\n\n            The Supreme Court has held that \"parties who 'reach out\n\nbeyond   one    state       and        create    continuing      relationships       and\n\nobligations    with     citizens         of     another   state'    are    subject    to\n\nregulation and sanctions in the other [s]tate for the consequences\n\nof their activities.\"         Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S.\n\n462, 473 (1985) (quoting Travelers Health Ass'n v. Virginia, 339\n\nU.S. 643, 647 (1950)).             Evidence of a defendant's entry into a\n\ncontractual relationship with a plaintiff in another state is\n\nrelevant to whether the defendant \"reached out\" to that state. But\n\nthe mere fact that a plaintiff entered into a contract with a\n\ndefendant in the forum state is not in and of itself dispositive of\n\nthe personal jurisdiction question.                \"The [Supreme] Court long ago\n\nrejected the notion that personal jurisdiction might turn on\n\n'mechanical' tests or on 'conceptualistic . . . theories of the\n\nplace of contracting or of performance.'\" Burger King, 471 U.S. at\n\n478 (omission in original) (quoting Int'l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 319;\n\nHoopeston    Canning    Co.       v.

The relatedness requirement is not\n             an open door; it is closely read, and it\n             requires a showing of a material connection.\n             This court \"steadfastly reject[s] the exercise\n             of   personal     jurisdiction     whenever   the\n             connection between the cause of action and the\n             defendant's     forum-state     contacts    seems\n             attenuated    and    indirect.\"   \"Instead,   the\n             defendant's in-state conduct must form an\n             'important, or [at least] material, element of\n             proof' in the plaintiff's case.\" A broad\n             \"but-for\" argument is generally insufficient.\n             . . . \"[D]ue process demands something like a\n             'proximate cause' nexus.\"\n\nHarlow, 432 F.3d at 60-61 (citations omitted) (quoting Pleasant St.\n\nI, 960 F.2d at 1089; Cambridge Literary Props., 295 F.3d at 65);\n\nsee   also   Phillips     Exeter   Acad.,   196    F.3d     at   289.    None   of\n\nplaintiffs'     claims    is   sufficiently       related    to    HG   Limited's\n\nMassachusetts contacts.\n\n             Plaintiffs allege that Platten was induced to enter into\n\nthe Agreement by misrepresentations that were made by an agent of\n\nthe Partnership in Massachusetts and that \"[t]he scheme to defraud\n\n                                     -37-\n\fand mislead Platten was furthered by four letters sent to him in\n\nMassachusetts from the Partnership's New York lawyers and Matthews\n\nhimself.\"    They further allege that \"[t]wo similar letters were\n\nsent by Matthews and the Partnership's New York counsel to Flannery\n\nin   Massachusetts.\"11       These   letters   all   dealt   with   the   non-\n\ncompetition and termination distribution clauses of the Agreement,\n\nand the plaintiffs' rights and responsibilities thereunder.12\n\n            Again, plaintiffs failed to provide any details in their\n\ncomplaint or affidavits about the circumstances surrounding the\n\nparties' entry into the Agreement, including any misrepresentations\n\nthat were made at that time, who may have made them, and in what\n\ncapacity.     Thus,   any    alleged   misrepresentations     made   by   the\n\nPartnership at the time of contracting cannot be the basis of\n\nspecific jurisdiction over HG Limited.\n\n            As for the correspondence from the Partnership's lawyers\n\nand Matthews to Platten and Flannery, that itself does not suffice\n\nto show relatedness.        See Far W. Capital, Inc. v. Towne, 46 F.3d\n\n      11\n          Plaintiffs do not allege that any of the \"Hay Group\"\nentities or their representatives directed any correspondence to\nPfau in Massachusetts. The record shows that Pfau did not live or\nwork in Massachusetts during the time period relevant to the\nlitigation.\n      12\n          The two letters that each plaintiff received were a\nSeptember 4, 2002 letter from Matthews, which stated, among other\nthings, that \"[t]he Partnership Agreement provides that your\ntermination distribution may be reduced in amount if you are in\nbreach of the [non-competition obligations],\" and a September 26,\n2002 letter from HG Limited's counsel, which gave notice that\n\"[y]our eligibility [for distributions] is . . . deferred\" because\nof violation of the non-competition clause.\n\n                                     -38-\n\f1071, 1077 (10th Cir. 1995) (\"It is well-established that phone\n\ncalls and letters are not necessarily sufficient in themselves to\n\nestablish minimum contacts.\"); see also Nicholas v. Buchanan, 806\n\nF.2d 305, 307-08 (1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam) (collecting cases).\n\nWe are doubtful that the letters even provide a basis for a viable\n\ncause of action.      Platten and Flannery did not allege reasonable\n\nreliance on the purported misrepresentations; thus, any harm that\n\nPlatten     or   Flannery   suffered     did   not    arise     out    of   those\n\nmisrepresentations, but instead out of the Partnership's alleged\n\nbreach of the promise to pay them their termination distributions.\n\nIn    specific   jurisdiction   terms,    plaintiffs     have    not    shown   a\n\n\"material connection\" between their injuries and HG Limited's\n\ncontacts in Massachusetts and therefore cannot meet the relatedness\n\nrequirement of the due process inquiry.13            See Harlow, 432 F.3d at\n\n61.\n\n\n\n       13\n          Plaintiffs rely on Murphy v. Erwin-Wasey, Inc., 460 F.2d\n661 (1st Cir. 1972), which this court decided before the advent of\nthe Supreme Court's modern personal jurisdiction cases, see, e.g.,\nBurger King, 471 U.S. 462; Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984),\nfor the proposition that \"there can be no constitutional objection\nto Massachusetts asserting jurisdiction over the out-of-state\nsender of a fraudulent misrepresentation, for such a sender has\nthereby 'purposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of\nconducting activities within the forum State.'\" Murphy, 460 F.2d\nat 664 (quoting Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958)).\nMurphy, however, was an intentional tort case in which plaintiff's\nalleged injury came directly as a result of defendants' fraudulent\nmisrepresentations. Id. at 663. Murphy also recognized that where\n\"it is clear from his allegation that plaintiff was not deceived by\n[the allegedly tortious] acts, jurisdiction may not be asserted\nunder [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, § 3(c)].\" Id. at 665.\n\n                                   -39-\n\f             Nor does HG Limited's alleged breach of fiduciary duty\n\nsatisfy   the    constitutional       standard    for   asserting      specific\n\njurisdiction.       \"A breach of fiduciary duty occurs [in the state]\n\nwhere the fiduciary acts disloyally.\"            Phillips Exeter Acad., 196\n\nF.3d at 291.        Thus, for minimum contacts analysis, even if the\n\neffects of the alleged breach were felt in Massachusetts, there is\n\nno evidence in the record that the alleged breach itself \"occurred\"\n\nin this state, see id. (concluding that \"an in-forum effect of an\n\nextra-forum breach . . . [was] inadequate to support a finding of\n\nrelatedness\"), as opposed to, say, Bermuda, where HG Limited has\n\nits usual place of business, or Pennsylvania, from whence Chris\n\nMatthews allegedly controlled the Partnership.\n\n                     b.    General Jurisdiction over HG Limited\n\n             Plaintiffs argue that general jurisdiction also exists\n\nover HG Limited by virtue of its parent-subsidiary relationship\n\nwith   HGI    and    of   Platten's    activities,      as    a   partner,   in\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n             \"General jurisdiction [may] exist[] when the defendant\n\nhas engaged in 'continuous and systematic activity' in the forum,\n\neven if the activity is unrelated to the suit.\"              Daynard, 290 F.3d\n\nat 51 (quoting Pleasant St. I, 960 F.2d at 1088).                 \"The standard\n\nfor evaluating whether [defendants' alleged] contacts satisfy the\n\nconstitutional general jurisdiction test 'is considerably more\n\nstringent' than that applied to specific jurisdiction questions.\"\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\fNoonan, 135 F.3d at 93 (quoting Glater v. Eli Lilly & Co., 744 F.2d\n\n213, 216 (1st Cir. 1984)).\n\n            The bar is set even higher in a case like this one, in\n\nwhich plaintiffs seek to disregard the corporate form. \"The mere\n\nfact that a subsidiary company does business within a state does\n\nnot confer jurisdiction over its nonresident parent, even if the\n\nparent is sole owner of the subsidiary.               There is a presumption of\n\ncorporate separateness that must be overcome by clear evidence\n\n. . . .\"   Escude Cruz v. Ortho Pharm. Corp. 619 F.2d 902, 905 (1st\n\nCir. 1980) (citation omitted); see also Donatelli v. Nat'l Hockey\n\nLeague, 893 F.2d 459, 465 (1st Cir. 1990); My Bread, 233 N.E.2d at\n\n752 (elaborating the contours of the corporate disregard doctrine).\n\n            Relying primarily on Platten's affidavits, plaintiffs\n\nargue   that      HG    Limited   engaged    in     continuous   and    systematic\n\nactivities     in      Massachusetts   \"through      the   Partnership's   active\n\ncontrol    over     HGI's   Boston     office\"      and   \"through   Platten,   who\n\nroutinely engaged in Partnership business in Massachusetts.\"\n\n               Again, there is no reason to disregard the corporate\n\nform in this case. Ultimately, nothing in the record substantiates\n\nthe proposition that HG Limited \"plainly made a choice to avail\n\nitself of the forum's benefices.\"            Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 466.         No\n\npersonal    jurisdiction,         specific     or   general,   exists    over   the\n\ndefendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -41-\n\f            3.        Denial of Motion for Partial Reconsideration and\n                      for Jurisdictional Discovery\n\n            Plaintiffs also claim error in the district court's\n\nsummary denial of their motion for partial reconsideration of its\n\ndismissal of HG Limited for lack of personal jurisdiction.                    With\n\nthe exception of allegations based on Platten Affidavit III, which\n\nwas not admitted into the record, their motion for reconsideration\n\nmerely reiterated the allegations and arguments advanced in their\n\nreply to the Offshore Defendants' dismissal motion.                There was no\n\nabuse of discretion in the district court's declining to reconsider\n\nits previous ruling.         See Servants of the Paraclete v. Does, 204\n\nF.3d 1005, 1012 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that \"a motion for\n\nreconsideration is appropriate where the court has misapprehended\n\nthe facts, a party's position, or the controlling law,\" but is not\n\nappropriate      as   a   \"vehicle[]     to     reargue   an   issue   previously\n\naddressed   by    the     court   when    the    motion   merely   advances    new\n\narguments[] or supporting facts which were available at the time of\n\nthe original motion\").\n\n            This leaves plaintiffs' final objection, which is to the\n\ndistrict court's summary denial of their motion to defer ruling on\n\nthe Rule 12(b)(2) issue pending jurisdictional discovery, which\n\nthey requested as an alternative to their motion for partial\n\nreconsideration.        Because \"[t]rial management is peculiarly within\n\nthe ken of the district court,\" United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d\n\n754, 770 (1st Cir. 1995), we review only for abuse of discretion,\n\n                                         -42-\n\fand find none here.\n\n           \"[A]     diligent     plaintiff      who    sues   an    out-of-state\n\ncorporation and who makes out a colorable case for the existence of\n\nin personam jurisdiction may well be entitled to a modicum of\n\njurisdictional      discovery     if    the      corporation       interposes   a\n\njurisdictional defense.” Sunview Condo. Ass'n v. Flexel Int'l, 116\n\nF.3d 962, 964 (1st Cir. 1997).                However, the availability of\n\njurisdictional      discovery    is    subject    to   the    district    court's\n\ndiscretion. See id.; accord United States v. Swiss Am. Bank, Ltd.,\n\n274 F.3d 610, 625-26 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           \"If a party needs jurisdictional discovery, that party\n\nhas an obligation to request it in a timely manner.\"                   Barrett v.\n\nLombardi, 239 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 2001). Plaintiffs had ample\n\nopportunity to request jurisdictional discovery in the full year\n\nbetween when they filed their initial complaint in state court and\n\nwhen the district court ruled on the Offshore Defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Yet, plaintiffs made no\n\nattempt   to   do   so   until    after   the     district     court    ruled   in\n\ndefendants' favor.       That alone suffices to justify the district\n\ncourt's rejection of their motion.            See id. at 28-29 (finding no\n\nabuse of discretion in the district court's denial of discovery\n\nwhen defendant did not seek discovery at any time prior to the\n\nentry of an adverse judgment).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -43-\n\f                     III.\n\nWe affirm.

In seeking redress for this alleged wrong, plaintiffs could have brought their contract claims against the Partnership's successor-in-interest, HG (Bermuda) Limited (\"HG Limited\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in Bermuda, where HG Limited was organized and has its usual place of business and in accordance with whose laws the parties agreed to settle their contract disputes. Instead, they sought to reach HG Limited in Massachusetts. To do so, they had to bring in a number of other defendants &#8212; who were not parties to the agreement &#8212; under close to a dozen tenuous legal theories. As a result, we discuss the Massachusetts law of breach of contract, civil conspiracy, and negligent misrepresentation, as well as seven other state and federal claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed plaintiffs' action on various grounds: for some claims, failure to establish personal jurisdiction, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2), and for others, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We affirm, concluding that plaintiffs have stated no claims against the corporate parties as to whom there may be personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts. As to the one other entity against which plaintiffs do state claims, plaintiffs did not meet their burden of proving that there is personal jurisdiction over the relevant defendant in Massachusetts, as there would have been in Bermuda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts as they appear in plaintiffs' original verified complaint and in their subsequent affidavits that were admitted into the record by the district court. <i>See Daynard v.

Sch. of Law,</i> 142 F.3d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs Platten, Flannery, and Pfau are former employees of Hay Group Inc. (\"HGI\"), an international consulting business incorporated in Pennsylvania.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> HGI is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hay Acquisition Company I, Inc. (\"Hay Acquisition\"), a Delaware corporation. In turn, Hay Acquisition is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hay Group Investment Holding B.V. (\"Hay BV\"), a Netherlands corporation, which itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of HG Limited, a Bermudan corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that the five corporations, together with Chris Matthews, operated as an \"association-in-fact\" known as the \"Hay Group,\" in which the operations of the corporations and the Partnership were intermingled and controlled by Matthews. Matthews was the Chief Executive Partner of the Partnership and became the Chief Executive Officer of HG Limited when the Partnership was reconstituted as such in 2000. At all times relevant to the litigation, Matthews was also the sole stockholder of Hay BV, the Chairman of the Board and President of HGI, and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Hay Acquisition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Platten was hired in 1989 as a Senior Executive Compensation Consultant in HGI's Boston office. He was promoted in 1990 to Manager of that office and in 1998 to East Operations Director, a position that he held until it was eliminated, and his employment with HGI terminated, in 1999. In 1997, Platten also became a member of the Partnership Management Committee. During the entirety of his tenure at HGI, Platten worked out of the Boston office, where he received, often by phone and at least twice in person, directions from Matthews about both HGI and Partnership business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Co-plaintiff Flannery was hired in 1981 as an Associate in the Chicago office of HGI. He subsequently transferred to other HGI offices, including those in Kansas City, St. Louis, and Singapore, where he served in various capacities, including as General Manager. He was based in HGI's Dallas office at the time he left the consulting practice voluntarily in 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third plaintiff, Pfau, was hired in 1990 as a Senior Consultant in HGI's New York office and was eventually promoted to Managing Director of the Research for Management division. His employment with HGI, which was based solely in New York, terminated voluntarily by agreement in 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of their employment with HGI, plaintiffs were each required to enter into a partnership agreement (\"Agreement\") with the Partnership. Neither HGI nor Hay Acquisition was a party to the Agreement; the Agreement itself says that it was made \"by and among\" the initial and continuing partners of the Partnership. The Agreement specifies that Bermuda law governs its interpretation and enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the terms of the Agreement, all partners, including the plaintiffs, were required to make periodic capital contributions to the Partnership. Upon termination of employment and absent some other agreement between the parties, a partner was entitled, on the third anniversary of withdrawal from the Partnership, to a termination distribution comprised of the sum of the partner's capital contributions and his share of Partnership assets. The distribution did not have to be paid in full, however, if Matthews and the Partnership Management Committee determined that the partner had been terminated for cause or (most relevant here) that the partner's termination was \"accompanied by\" the violation of the Agreement's non-competition clause. In that event, the partner's termination distribution could be reduced to the amount of his capital contributions and paid out over a five-year period from the date of termination. It is this provision of the Agreement that is at the center of this dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After leaving HGI, plaintiffs accepted employment with other consulting groups &#8212; Platten with the Boston office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, and then with the Boston office of Watson Wyatt &amp; Company; Flannery with the Boston office of Arthur Anderson, LLP; and Pfau with the New York office of Watson Wyatt &amp; Company. Each plaintiff maintains that his actions after leaving HGI were consistent with the Agreement's non-competition obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2002, each plaintiff made written inquiries to HG Limited, the Partnership's successor, about his termination distribution. In turn, each received, among other correspondence from HG Limited, a September 4, 2002 letter signed by Matthews. The letter stated that a former partner's termination distribution was tethered to his non-competition obligations and asked each recipient to prove that he was not in violation of those obligations. Each plaintiff responded by letter that he had not broken the non-competition clause. On September 26, 2002, counsel for HG Limited informed each plaintiff in writing that he was not entitled to the immediate and full payment of his termination distribution because he had failed to respect the non-competition clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that except with regard to termination distributions, merely working for another consulting group was generally not considered by the \"Hay Group\" to be a violation of a partner's non-competition agreement. They further allege that accusing them of violating their non-competition obligations was merely a tactic the Partnership used to wrongfully deny them their termination distributions. Matthews, they maintain, orchestrated this scheme to the benefit of the existing partners, whose partnership bonuses would increase as less money was being paid out to their former colleagues. Plaintiffs allege that the benefits would also trickle down to the \"Hay Group\" entities, including HGI and Hay Acquisition, which would have more available cash and a reduced need for borrowing to fund their operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Relevant Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought suit in the Superior Court for Suffolk County, Massachusetts, on June 19, 2003. In addition to the Partnership and its successor-in-interest, HG Limited, plaintiffs named three other corporate defendants &#8212; Hay BV, Hay Acquisition, and HGI &#8212; and one individual defendant, Chris Matthews.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs asserted a total of eleven counts in their complaint. Against all defendants, plaintiffs claimed breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, unfair and deceptive practices, civil conspiracy, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1961-68. Plaintiffs also asserted a claim of interference with contractual relations against Hay BV, Hay Acquisition, and HGI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Along with their verified complaint, plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for an attachment on trustee process of the goods, effects, or credits of the defendants in the amount of $843,329, the sum of the termination distributions that plaintiffs claimed were due. Finding \"a reasonable lik[e]lihood that the plaintiff[s] will recover judgment,\" the superior court granted the motion and issued an ex parte order of attachment. Plaintiffs subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction, requesting an additional double of that amount because of the mandatory treble damages provided under the RICO statute. This motion was denied by the court on June 25, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants removed the action on July 15, 2003 to the Massachusetts federal district court on the basis of complete diversity of the parties and, as to the RICO Act claim, federal question jurisdiction. On August 8, 2003, Hay Acquisition and HGI (\"Domestic Defendants\") filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The district court on June 16, 2004 granted the motion with respect to all claims against the Domestic Defendants except for three: breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. On the first two claims, the court held that, because of the choice of law provision in the partnership Agreement, the Domestic Defendants needed to have shown that the claims would have been meritless under Bermuda, not Massachusetts, law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 25, 2004, plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint, seeking to restore the dismissed counts by adding allegations of fraudulent inducement that they argued would cure the defects in their claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and RICO Act violation. Their amended complaint further sought to clarify that the claims for interference with contractual relations and conspiracy were pleadings in the alternative, to be considered only in the event that Hay Acquisition and HGI were found to be separate entities from the Partnership. This motion was denied as futile by the district court on November 23, 2004. Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration, which was denied on January 14, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 8, 2004, the Domestic Defendants moved for the court to reconsider its denial of the motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining three contract claims against them. On December 21, 2004, the district court, holding that Massachusetts law applied after all, granted the motion for reconsideration and dismissed the breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment claims against Hay Acquisition and HGI. On December 29, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the contractual relations, negligence, and civil conspiracy claims against Hay Acquisition and HGI, which the court denied on January 13, 2005.

(\"Offshore Defendants\") filed a separate motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficient service of process. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2), (5). Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion on October 6, 2003, and, after defendants filed their reply, plaintiffs moved on December 10, 2003 for leave to file a response and a second affidavit of Platten (\"Platten Affidavit II\"). The district court denied plaintiffs' motion on December 23, 2003. On January 23, 2004, plaintiffs moved for the court to reconsider its denial of their motion to file Platten Affidavit II; the court denied that motion on February 18, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the Offshore Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on June 15, 2004.

From time to time, at least twice, Matthews came to the Boston office to review local financial performance and to review progress on product development. He frequently supervised performance and profitability of the Boston office and other local offices acting as head of U.S. operations. Matthews also regularly placed telephone calls to Platten in Boston wherein he would give [Platten] instructions on management matters relating to the Boston office and they would discuss the Boston office's monthly performance, staffing issues and collection efforts. The Boston office had at least 100 clients located in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken as true, these allegations do not meet the standard for disregarding the corporate form.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances here closely track those in <i>Birbara,</i> 99 F.3d 1233, in which we vacated a jury verdict on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to justify piercing the corporate veil. Here, as in <i>Birbara,</i> there is insufficient showing of confused intermingling or pervasive control. That Matthews (and Platten) sometimes acted on behalf of the Partnership and other times on behalf of its subsidiaries \"is to be expected when individuals serve as directors for both a parent and its subsidiary.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1239-40. Plaintiffs themselves acknowledge that Matthews was \"acting as head of U.S. operations\" when he supervised the Boston office's performance. \"It is also to be expected that when a subsidiary company profits, the parent company\" &#8212; in this case, the Partnership and its partners &#8212; \"will as well.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1240.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite their allegations of intermingling, plaintiffs have never alleged that <i>they</i> were confused about the identity of the legal entity with which they were contracting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Indeed, the allegations are insufficient to show any \"fraudulent or injurious consequence of the intercorporate relationship.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1238 (quoting <i>My Bread,</i> 233 N.E.2d at 752). \"Plaintiffs were never misled about which corporate entity ... was obligated to them or was dealing with them.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1240, 233 N.E.2d 748. They acknowledged that their Agreement was with the Partnership and clearly understood that the Partnership was responsible for the payment of the distributions.

Beneficial Fin. Co.,</i> 360 Mass. 188, 275 N.E.2d 33, 91 (1971) (courts will only look through the corporate veil to \"accomplish ... essential justice\"); <i>My Bread,</i> 233 N.E.2d at 752 (limiting the application of the corporate disregard doctrine only to \"rare particular situations in order to prevent gross inequity\"); <i>see also Birbara,</i> 99 F.3d at 1239 (collecting sources). Plaintiffs would not have been in the position they are in now if they had sought relief directly from HG Limited by suing it in Bermuda.

Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc.,</i> 412 F.3d 215, 229 (1st Cir.2005). Also, because the allegations are not sufficient to show that they were beneficiaries to the contract, the Domestic Defendants cannot be held liable for unjust enrichment. In any event, Massachusetts law does not allow litigants to override an express contract by arguing unjust enrichment. <i>See, e.g., Zarum v. Brass Mill Materials Corp.,</i> 334 Mass. 81, 134 N.E.2d 141, 143 (1956) (\"The law will not imply a contract where there is an existing express contract covering the same subject matter.\").

Under Massachusetts common law, \"[i]n an action for intentional interference with contractual relations, the plaintiff must prove that: (1) he had a contract with a third party; (2) the defendant knowingly induced the third party to break that contract; (3) the defendant's interference, in addition to being intentional, was improper in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant's actions.\" <i>G.S.

Taking these allegations as true, plaintiffs still cannot make out a claim for interference of contract against the Domestic Defendants based on their theory of liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, in evaluating \"whether the acts and intent of natural persons, be they officers, directors or employees, can be treated as the acts and intent of the corporation itself,\" <i>Beneficial Fin.,</i> 275 N.E.2d at 77, a court must examine whether those natural persons have \"been vested with the authority to act on behalf of the corporation in the sphere of corporate business in which he commits the [alleged wrongful] act,\" <i>id.</i> at 80 (applying this test to a question of criminal liability, but deriving the test from civil and criminal cases). The record lacks any allegation or fact by which a reasonable inference can be drawn that Matthews was acting in the capacity and within the authority of his positions at Hay Acquisition and HGI when he allegedly \"interfered\" with the <i>Partnership's</i> contractual relationship with the plaintiffs. <i>See, e.g., Stoneman v. Fox Film Corp.,</i> 295 Mass. 419, 4 N.E.2d 63, 66 (1936) (noting that the president of a corporation \"has not unlimited power but is restricted to doing those things which are usual and necessary in the ordinary course of the corporate business,\" and holding that, where the president committed wrongs while acting beyond the scope of his authority, the corporation is not civilly liable for resulting injuries). Moreover, as the district court intimated, plaintiffs essentially were hoisted by their own petard: crediting their allegation that all the \"Hay Group\" entities constituted one enterprise, \"it seems that the plaintiffs seek to hold the defendants liable for interfering with their own contract\"; \"[t]here is no such tort.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar problems beleaguer plaintiffs' civil conspiracy claim. They allege that Matthews \"organized and orchestrated\" a scheme by which employees of HGI would be invited to join the Partnership, required to make substantial capital contributions with promises of payment of termination distributions, and subsequently denied their distributions by false claims of violations of the non-competition obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"For liability to attach on this basis, there must be, first, a common design or an agreement, although not necessarily express, between two or more persons to do a wrongful act and, second, proof of some tortious act in furtherance of the agreement.\" <i>Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. v. P &amp; B Autobody,</i> 43 F.3d 1546, 1564 (1st Cir. 1994). Plaintiffs make no factual allegations supporting the conclusion that the Domestic Defendants engaged in a common design or agreement with the Partnership to do a wrongful act; to the contrary, plaintiffs' allegation is that all the defendants comprise a single corporate enterprise. No civil conspiracy claim can lie under plaintiffs' theory because an entity cannot conspire with itself. There is also a risk in plaintiffs' argument of confusing a family relationship among corporations with a conspiracy; all that is shown here is a family relationship, and that is insufficient on its own to support a conspiracy claim. <i>Cf. Gilbuilt Homes, Inc. v. Cont'l Homes of New Eng.,</i> 667 F.2d 209, 210 (1st Cir.1981) (holding that \"a vague reference to `inter-family relationships'\" was not enough to state a claim for conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1).

On appeal, plaintiffs essentially concede that at the time the district court considered the claims, they had not made allegations sufficient to support them. They suggest that their success on appeal turns on the outcome of our review of the district court's November 23, 2004 denial of plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint to cure acknowledged deficiencies in their original pleadings. Plaintiffs attached a copy of their proposed amended complaint to that motion; the court determined the motion was futile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion. <i>See Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth, &amp; Their Families,</i> 274 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2001). Within that standard, pure questions of law are reviewed de novo. Since denial of plaintiffs' motion as futile would be appropriate if the amended complaint still failed to state a claim sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, our review in this instance is, for practical purposes, identical to review of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal based on the allegations in the amended complaint. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, to make out a claim for fraud, plaintiffs must show that the Domestic Defendants made a false representation of a material fact with knowledge of its falsity for purposes of inducing the plaintiff to act thereon, and that the plaintiff actually relied on the representation. <i>See Slaney v. Westwood Auto, Inc.,</i> 366 Mass. 688, 322 N.E.2d 768, 779 (1975). For a claim for misrepresentation, plaintiffs must demonstrate that the Domestic Defendants (1) made false statements of material fact (2) to induce plaintiffs to enter into the Agreement, and (3) that they reasonably relied on those statements to their detriment. <i>See Rodowicz v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 192 F.3d 162, 175 (1st Cir.1999) (citing <i>Zimmerman v. Kent,</i> 31 Mass.App.Ct. 72, 575 N.E.2d 70, 74 (1991)). Both causes of action, then, require plaintiffs' reliance on defendants' representations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their proposed amended complaint, plaintiffs alleged that they were \"induced to enter into the Agreement by [certain] representations made in the Agreement,\" and that two individuals, Ken Martin and Jim Williams &#8212; each of whom was a partner in the Partnership &#8212; made \"representations\" in person or by phone as to the meaning of the non-competition provision of the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These allegations do not suffice to hold Hay Acquisition and HGI liable for the fraud and misrepresentation claims. After all, plaintiffs did not allege any justified reliance on the misrepresentations. In fact, they stated that they entered into the Agreement because it was \"a condition of employment with the Hay Group.\" And, as the district court pointed out, their complaint states that they continued to demand their termination distributions even after some of the alleged misrepresentations were made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the civil RICO Act claim, it fails because plaintiffs never alleged proximate cause between defendants' wrongful conduct and plaintiffs' injuries. As the district court observed, even if the Domestic Defendants can be held responsible for misrepresentations by mail or wire, plaintiffs did not rely on those misrepresentations. Therefore, their injuries, if proven, come not from those misrepresentations, but from HG Limited's alleged breach of the Agreement by failing to pay the three men their termination distributions. <i>See George Lussier Enters., Inc. v. Subaru of New Eng., Inc.,</i> 393 F.3d 36, 51 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Section 1964(c) of [18 U.S.C.] requires that the defendant's specified acts of racketeering were the proximate cause of the plaintiffs' injuries.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the allegations in plaintiffs' proposed amended complaint would have been insufficient to make out fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and RICO Act claims against the Domestic Defendants, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to amend the complaint as futile.

Additionally, as the district court concluded, the alleged misrepresentations made by defendants did not arise out of any \"trade or commerce\" and thus do not fall within the purview of the statute. <i>See Linkage Corp. v.

Under that standard, \"plaintiff[s] ultimately bear[] the burden of persuading the court that jurisdiction exists.\" <i>Mass.

Specifically, plaintiffs contend that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the propositions that the Partnership solicited Platten to become a partner in Massachusetts, that the Agreement was executed in Massachusetts, and that Platten's performance under the Agreement occurred primarily in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HG Limited, in turn, counters that it has its principal place of business in Bermuda; maintains its books, records, and accounts in Bermuda; and pays taxes in Bermuda. Moreover, it maintains that it has never attempted to solicit or service customers in Massachusetts or to derive substantial revenue from services rendered in the state. As a holding company, it exercises only limited control over HGI, \"a fourth-tier subsidiary,\" which has an office in, among other places, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume for present purposes that HG Limited fully assumed the Partnership's obligations under the Agreement. Nonetheless, we hold, as did the district court, that the record lacks support for plaintiffs' allegations that the Partnership established sufficient minimum contacts in Massachusetts to be subject to suit by plaintiffs in this state. Our inquiry begins and ends with the first prong of the constitutional inquiry, that of relatedness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of specific jurisdiction over their contract claims, plaintiffs rely almost solely on the affidavits of Paul Platten. The first of those affidavits, and the only Platten affidavit admitted into the record, makes the following relevant allegations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. In February, 1989, I was hired by the defendant [HGI] with the Boston Office. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. As a condition of employment with the Hay Group, I was required to become a partner in the Partnership and, in or about 1992, in Massachusetts, I entered into an Agreement . . . with the Partnership. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from these allegations, plaintiffs provide no additional details about the place and circumstances of contracting. Flannery and Pfau's affidavits are silent with respect to the place of contracting, and neither of the two has ever claimed that their agreements with the Partnership were signed or executed in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that \"parties who `reach out beyond one state and create continuing relationships and obligations with citizens of another state' are subject to regulation and sanctions in the other [s]tate for the consequences of their activities.\" <i>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,</i> 471 U.S. 462, 473, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (quoting <i>Travelers Health Ass'n v. Virginia,</i> 339 U.S. 643, 647, 70 S.Ct. 927, 94 L.Ed. 1154 (1950)). Evidence of a defendant's entry into a contractual relationship with a plaintiff in another state is relevant to whether the defendant \"reached out\" to that state. But the mere fact that a plaintiff entered into a contract with a defendant in the forum state is not in and of itself dispositive of the personal jurisdiction question. \"The [Supreme] Court long ago rejected the notion that personal jurisdiction might turn on `mechanical' tests or on `conceptualistic. . . theories of the place of contracting or of performance.'\" <i>Burger King,</i> 471 U.S. at 478, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (omission in original) (quoting <i>Int'l Shoe,</i> 326 U.S. at 319, 66 S.Ct. 154; <i>Hoopeston Canning Co. v. Cullen,</i> 318 U.S. 313, 316, 63 S.Ct. 602, 87 L.Ed. 777 (1943)). \"Instead, [the Court has] emphasized the need for a `highly realistic' approach that recognizes that a `contract' is `ordinarily but an intermediate step serving to tie up prior business negotiations with future consequences which themselves are the real object of the business transaction.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 479, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (quoting <i>Hoopeston,</i> 318 U.S. at 316-17, 63 S.Ct. 602).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court points out, plaintiffs' affidavits are \"silent as to details regarding where negotiations took place, where the agreement was presented for signatures, where it was signed, where it was to be performed, and who represented the Partnership at the time of the negotiations.\" Aside from Platten's conclusory allegations that he performed Partnership business in Massachusetts, none of the plaintiffs offer additional information on whether the Partnership or HG Limited directed an out-of-state activity at the forum state, <i>see Phillips Exeter Acad.,</i> 196 F.3d at 289, whether the parties' Agreement contemplated ongoing interaction between Platten in Massachusetts and the Partnership or HG Limited in Bermuda, <i>see Daynard,</i> 290 F.3d at 61, or whether the two other plaintiffs' claims are at all related to the Partnership's and HG Limited's contacts in Massachusetts.

Platten and Flannery did not allege reasonable reliance on the purported misrepresentations; thus, any harm that Platten or Flannery suffered did not arise out of those misrepresentations, but instead out of the Partnership's alleged breach of the promise to pay them their termination distributions. In specific jurisdiction terms, plaintiffs have not shown a \"material connection\" between their injuries and HG Limited's contacts in Massachusetts and therefore cannot meet the relatedness requirement of the due process inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> <i>See Harlow,</i> 432 F.3d at 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does HG Limited's alleged breach of fiduciary duty satisfy the constitutional standard for asserting specific jurisdiction. \"A breach of fiduciary duty occurs [in the state] where the fiduciary acts disloyally.\" <i>Phillips Exeter Acad.,</i> 196 F.3d at 291.

With the exception of allegations based on Platten Affidavit III, which was not admitted into the record, their motion for reconsideration merely reiterated the allegations and arguments advanced in their reply to the Offshore Defendants' dismissal motion. There was no abuse of discretion in the district court's declining to reconsider its previous ruling. <i>See Servants of the Paraclete v.

Because \"[t]rial management is peculiarly within the ken of the district court,\" <i>United States v.

(\"HGI\"), an international consulting business incorporated in Pennsylvania.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> HGI is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hay Acquisition Company I, Inc. (\"Hay Acquisition\"), a Delaware corporation. In turn, Hay Acquisition is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hay Group Investment Holding B.V. (\"Hay BV\"), a Netherlands corporation, which itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of HG Limited, a Bermudan corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that the five corporations, together with Chris Matthews, operated as an \"association-in-fact\" known as the \"Hay Group,\" in which the operations of the corporations and the Partnership were intermingled and controlled by Matthews. Matthews was the Chief Executive Partner of the Partnership and became the Chief Executive Officer of HG Limited when the Partnership was reconstituted as such in 2000. At all times relevant to the litigation, Matthews was also the sole stockholder of Hay BV, the Chairman of the Board and President of HGI, and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Hay Acquisition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Platten was hired in 1989 as a Senior Executive Compensation Consultant in HGI's Boston office. He was promoted in 1990 to Manager of that office and in 1998 to East Operations Director, a position that he held until it was eliminated, and his employment with HGI terminated, in 1999. In 1997, Platten also became a member of the Partnership Management Committee. During the entirety of his tenure at HGI, Platten worked out of the Boston office, where he received, often by phone and at least twice in person, directions from Matthews about both HGI and Partnership business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Co-plaintiff Flannery was hired in 1981 as an Associate in the Chicago office of HGI. He subsequently transferred to other HGI offices, including those in Kansas City, St. Louis, and Singapore, where he served in various capacities, including as General Manager. He was based in HGI's Dallas office at the time he left the consulting practice voluntarily in 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third plaintiff, Pfau, was hired in 1990 as a Senior Consultant in HGI's New York office and was eventually promoted to Managing Director of the Research for Management division. His employment with HGI, which was based solely in New York, terminated voluntarily by agreement in 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of their employment with HGI, plaintiffs were each required to enter into a partnership agreement (\"Agreement\") with the Partnership. Neither HGI nor Hay Acquisition was a party to the Agreement; the Agreement itself says that it was made \"by and among\" the initial and continuing partners of the Partnership. The Agreement specifies that Bermuda law governs its interpretation and enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the terms of the Agreement, all partners, including the plaintiffs, were required to make periodic capital contributions to the Partnership. Upon termination of employment and absent some other agreement between the parties, a partner was entitled, on the third anniversary of withdrawal from the Partnership, to a termination distribution comprised of the sum of the partner's capital contributions and his share of Partnership assets. The distribution did not have to be paid in full, however, if Matthews and the Partnership Management Committee determined that the partner had been terminated for cause or (most relevant here) that the partner's termination was \"accompanied by\" the violation of the Agreement's non-competition clause. In that event, the partner's termination distribution could be reduced to the amount of his capital contributions and paid out over a five-year period from the date of termination. It is this provision of the Agreement that is at the center of this dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After leaving HGI, plaintiffs accepted employment with other consulting groups &#8212; Platten with the Boston office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, and then with the Boston office of Watson Wyatt &amp; Company; Flannery with the Boston office of Arthur Anderson, LLP; and Pfau with the New York office of Watson Wyatt &amp; Company. Each plaintiff maintains that his actions after leaving HGI were consistent with the Agreement's non-competition obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2002, each plaintiff made written inquiries to HG Limited, the Partnership's successor, about his termination distribution. In turn, each received, among other correspondence from HG Limited, a September 4, 2002 letter signed by Matthews. The letter stated that a former partner's termination distribution was tethered to his non-competition obligations and asked each recipient to prove that he was not in violation of those obligations. Each plaintiff responded by letter that he had not broken the non-competition clause. On September 26, 2002, counsel for HG Limited informed each plaintiff in writing that he was not entitled to the immediate and full payment of his termination distribution because he had failed to respect the non-competition clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that except with regard to termination distributions, merely working for another consulting group was generally not considered by the \"Hay Group\" to be a violation of a partner's non-competition agreement. They further allege that accusing them of violating their non-competition obligations was merely a tactic the Partnership used to wrongfully deny them their termination distributions. Matthews, they maintain, orchestrated this scheme to the benefit of the existing partners, whose partnership bonuses would increase as less money was being paid out to their former colleagues. Plaintiffs allege that the benefits would also trickle down to the \"Hay Group\" entities, including HGI and Hay Acquisition, which would have more available cash and a reduced need for borrowing to fund their operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Relevant Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought suit in the Superior Court for Suffolk County, Massachusetts, on June 19, 2003. In addition to the Partnership and its successor-in-interest, HG Limited, plaintiffs named three other corporate defendants &#8212; Hay BV, Hay Acquisition, and HGI &#8212; and one individual defendant, Chris Matthews.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs asserted a total of eleven counts in their complaint. Against all defendants, plaintiffs claimed breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, unfair and deceptive practices, civil conspiracy, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1961-68. Plaintiffs also asserted a claim of interference with contractual relations against Hay BV, Hay Acquisition, and HGI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Along with their verified complaint, plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for an attachment on trustee process of the goods, effects, or credits of the defendants in the amount of $843,329, the sum of the termination distributions that plaintiffs claimed were due. Finding \"a reasonable lik[e]lihood that the plaintiff[s] will recover judgment,\" the superior court granted the motion and issued an ex parte order of attachment. Plaintiffs subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction, requesting an additional double of that amount because of the mandatory treble damages provided under the RICO statute. This motion was denied by the court on June 25, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants removed the action on July 15, 2003 to the Massachusetts federal district court on the basis of complete diversity of the parties and, as to the RICO Act claim, federal question jurisdiction. On August 8, 2003, Hay Acquisition and HGI (\"Domestic Defendants\") filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The district court on June 16, 2004 granted the motion with respect to all claims against the Domestic Defendants except for three: breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. On the first two claims, the court held that, because of the choice of law provision in the partnership Agreement, the Domestic Defendants needed to have shown that the claims would have been meritless under Bermuda, not Massachusetts, law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 25, 2004, plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint, seeking to restore the dismissed counts by adding allegations of fraudulent inducement that they argued would cure the defects in their claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and RICO Act violation. Their amended complaint further sought to clarify that the claims for interference with contractual relations and conspiracy were pleadings in the alternative, to be considered only in the event that Hay Acquisition and HGI were found to be separate entities from the Partnership. This motion was denied as futile by the district court on November 23, 2004.

On December 21, 2004, the district court, holding that Massachusetts law applied after all, granted the motion for reconsideration and dismissed the breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment claims against Hay Acquisition and HGI. On December 29, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the contractual relations, negligence, and civil conspiracy claims against Hay Acquisition and HGI, which the court denied on January 13, 2005.

The record lacks any allegation or fact by which a reasonable inference can be drawn that Matthews was acting in the capacity and within the authority of his positions at Hay Acquisition and HGI when he allegedly \"interfered\" with the <i>Partnership's</i> contractual relationship with the plaintiffs. <i>See, e.g., Stoneman v.

Moreover, as the district court intimated, plaintiffs essentially were hoisted by their own petard: crediting their allegation that all the \"Hay Group\" entities constituted one enterprise, \"it seems that the plaintiffs seek to hold the defendants liable for interfering with their own contract\"; \"[t]here is no such tort.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar problems beleaguer plaintiffs' civil conspiracy claim.

Plaintiffs make no factual allegations supporting the conclusion that the Domestic Defendants engaged in a common design or agreement with the Partnership to do a wrongful act; to the contrary, plaintiffs' allegation is that all the defendants comprise a single corporate enterprise. No civil conspiracy claim can lie under plaintiffs' theory because an entity cannot conspire with itself. There is also a risk in plaintiffs' argument of confusing a family relationship among corporations with a conspiracy; all that is shown here is a family relationship, and that is insufficient on its own to support a conspiracy claim. <i>Cf.

On appeal, plaintiffs essentially concede that at the time the district court considered the claims, they had not made allegations sufficient to support them. They suggest that their success on appeal turns on the outcome of our review of the district court's November 23, 2004 denial of plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint to cure acknowledged deficiencies in their original pleadings. Plaintiffs attached a copy of their proposed amended complaint to that motion; the court determined the motion was futile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion. <i>See Hatch v.

Within that standard, pure questions of law are reviewed de novo. Since denial of plaintiffs' motion as futile would be appropriate if the amended complaint still failed to state a claim sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, our review in this instance is, for practical purposes, identical to review of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal based on the allegations in the amended complaint. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, to make out a claim for fraud, plaintiffs must show that the Domestic Defendants made a false representation of a material fact with knowledge of its falsity for purposes of inducing the plaintiff to act thereon, and that the plaintiff actually relied on the representation. <i>See Slaney v. Westwood Auto, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2241832\"><a href=\"/opinion/2241832/slaney-v-westwood-auto-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2241832\"><a href=\"/opinion/2241832/slaney-v-westwood-auto-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span>, 779 (1975). For a claim for misrepresentation, plaintiffs must demonstrate that the Domestic Defendants (1) made false statements of material fact (2) to induce plaintiffs to enter into the Agreement, and (3) that they reasonably relied on those statements to their detriment. <i>See Rodowicz v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins.

Both causes of action, then, require plaintiffs' reliance on defendants' representations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their proposed amended complaint, plaintiffs alleged that they were \"induced to enter into the Agreement by [certain] representations made in the Agreement,\" and that two individuals, Ken Martin and Jim Williams &#8212; each of whom was a partner in the Partnership &#8212; made \"representations\" in person or by phone as to the meaning of the non-competition provision of the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These allegations do not suffice to hold Hay Acquisition and HGI liable for the fraud and misrepresentation claims. After all, plaintiffs did not allege any justified reliance on the misrepresentations. In fact, they stated that they entered into the Agreement because it was \"a condition of employment with the Hay Group.\" And, as the district court pointed out, their complaint states that they continued to demand their termination distributions even after some of the alleged misrepresentations were made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the civil RICO Act claim, it fails because plaintiffs never alleged proximate cause between defendants' wrongful conduct and plaintiffs' injuries. As the district court observed, even if the Domestic Defendants can be held responsible for misrepresentations by mail or wire, plaintiffs did not rely on those misrepresentations. Therefore, their injuries, if proven, come not from those misrepresentations, but from HG Limited's alleged breach of the Agreement by failing to pay the three men their termination distributions. <i>See George Lussier Enters., Inc. v.

They suggest that the Partnership's fiduciary duty should be extended to HGI and Hay Acquisition, \"on whose behalf Matthews acted.\" This agency theory fails for the reasons articulated above. The district court correctly determined that \"plaintiffs have alleged no [independent] source of a fiduciary duty as to these defendants\" and the claim thus fails as a matter of pleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also contest the district court's dismissal of their claim under Mass.

Additionally, as the district court concluded, the alleged misrepresentations made by defendants did not arise out of any \"trade or commerce\" and thus do not fall within the purview of the statute. <i>See Linkage Corp. v.

That they did not see the need for a fuller factual presentation when they were required to respond does not rescue their case.

Specifically, plaintiffs contend that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the propositions that the Partnership solicited Platten to become a partner in Massachusetts, that the Agreement was executed in Massachusetts, and that Platten's performance under the Agreement occurred primarily in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HG Limited, in turn, counters that it has its principal place of business in Bermuda; maintains its books, records, and accounts in Bermuda; and pays taxes in Bermuda. Moreover, it maintains that it has never attempted to solicit or service customers in Massachusetts or to derive substantial revenue from services rendered in the state. As a holding company, it exercises only limited control over HGI, \"a fourth-tier subsidiary,\" which has an office in, among other places, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume for present purposes that HG Limited fully assumed the Partnership's obligations under the Agreement. Nonetheless, we hold, as did the district court, that the record lacks support for plaintiffs' allegations that the Partnership established sufficient minimum contacts in Massachusetts to be subject to suit by plaintiffs in this state.
