Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting\nby designation.\n\f             LIPEZ,   Circuit      Judge.      Evergreen   Credit    Union,         an\n\nundersecured creditor, appeals from the decision of the district\n\ncourt upholding the bankruptcy court's confirmation of debtor Clare\n\nA. Woodman's First Amended Chapter 13 Plan (\"the plan\"). Evergreen\n\nobjected to the confirmation of the plan on the ground that it did\n\nnot meet the requirement set forth in § 1325(b) that debtors devote\n\nall of their \"disposable income\" to their plans for at least three\n\nyears.   In particular, Evergreen claimed that Woodman's monthly\n\npurchases of cigarettes, amounting to $136.00, were not \"reasonably\n\nnecessary\" expenses within the meaning of § 1325(b)(2)(A).                  Thus,\n\nit argued that § 1325(b) required the exclusion of Woodman's\n\ncigarette expenditures from the calculation of her reasonably\n\nnecessary expenses, thereby increasing her projected disposable\n\nincome and consequently the amount that she would be required to\n\npay   each   month    into   the    plan.      The   bankruptcy    court,      in    a\n\nthoughtful     rescript,      overruled      Evergreen's   objection      to    the\n\nconfirmation of the plan.          In re Woodman, 287 B.R. 589, 596 (Bankr.\n\nD. Me. 2003).    Evergreen appealed, and the district court affirmed\n\nthe bankruptcy court's judgment.              Adhering to our long-standing\n\nrule that     arguments      not   squarely    presented   below    may   not       be\n\nadvanced for the first time on appeal, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f                                  I.\n\n          Evergreen contends that the bankruptcy court's analysis\n\nof whether cigarette expenses are disposable income was flawed\n\nbecause it did not include \"a rigorous review\" of \"objective\n\nfactors\" relating to the reasonableness of Woodman's asserted need\n\nfor cigarettes.   Section 1325(b)(2)(A), Evergreen avers, required\n\nthe court to consider such factors as\n\n     whether the Debtor experiences any ill-health effects\n     from her smoking, whether her physician has recommended\n     that she cease smoking, how long she has smoked, the\n     extent to which her consumption of cigarettes varies, the\n     brands or brands she smokes, whether she wants to stop\n     smoking, and the efforts she has made to quit.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy court did not consider those factors,\n\nEvergreen argues, it erred as a matter of law in overruling\n\nEvergreen's   objection   to   Woodman's   cigarette   expenses   and\n\nconfirming her Chapter 13 plan.\n\n          As the bankruptcy trustee points out correctly in its\n\nresponse brief, Evergreen never asked the bankruptcy court to adopt\n\nthe \"objective factors\" that it now claims should be applied to any\n\nanalysis under 11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(2)(A).   Instead, it argued that\n\nWoodman's cigarette expenses were excessive in the context of her\n\nother discretionary expenditures and that it was, furthermore,\n\nunreasonable per se since \"there is no redeeming value to smoking,\n\nand [the bankruptcy court] need not tolerate a debtor's behavior\n\nwhich is not only counterproductive but self-destructive.\"\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f              A    party's      failure   to     advance   an    issue   before   the\n\nbankruptcy court in the first instance forfeits its right to raise\n\nthat issue on appeal.            See Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp), 340 F.3d\n\n15,   25-26       (1st   Cir.    2003)    (argument    not      raised   before   the\n\nbankruptcy court will not be considered on appeal); LaRoche v.\n\nAmoskeag Bank (In re LaRoche), 969 F.2d 1299, 1305 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(same).   \"That a party may not advance an argument for the first\n\ntime on appeal is a virtually ironclad rule in this circuit. . . .\"\n\nIn re Carp, 340 F.3d at 26 (internal quotation marks omitted).                    We\n\nfind no extraordinary circumstances in the record that would\n\njustify a departure from this well-established prudential rule.\n\nSee Nat'l Assoc. of Soc. Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 637 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (exceptions to the raise-or-waive principle are \"few and\n\nfar between\").           Having failed to raise its \"objective factors\"\n\nargument before the bankruptcy court, Evergreen is foreclosed from\n\nadvancing it on appeal.1\n\n                                           II.\n\n              Evergreen      further      argues    that   the   bankruptcy   court\n\ncommitted a legal error by failing to aggregate all of Woodman's\n\n\n      1\n      Evergreen did raise its \"objective factors\" argument before\nthe district court, which rejected it on the merits.     That the\ndistrict court chose to address this issue, however, does not\npreserve it for appeal to this court. See In re Carp, 340 F.3d at\n21 (\"Notwithstanding the fact that we are the second-in-time\nreviewers, we cede no special deference to the district court\ndeterminations.     Rather our review directly addresses the\nbankruptcy court's decision.\") (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fdiscretionary expenditures and assess the reasonable necessity of\n\nthat total sum.       It argues that the court should have applied the\n\nmethodology adopted by the bankruptcy court in In re Gonzales, 157\n\nB.R. 604 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 1993).              The Gonzales court explained\n\nthat its task was\n\n     to identify how much of the Debtors' anticipated expenses\n     are discretionary in nature and to weigh them on this\n     scale. If the discretionary expenses in the aggregate\n     allow the Debtors to exceed their basic needs, including\n     a reasonable reserve for recreation and exigencies (the\n     reasonable \"cushion\"), then their plan cannot be\n     confirmed.\n\nId. at 609.     According to Evergreen, \"[t]he Bankruptcy Court below\n\ndid not use this methodology . . . despite being urged to do so by\n\nEvergreen, and thereby committed an error of law.\"                 Applying this\n\naggregating        methodology     to   Woodman's     discretionary    expenses,\n\nEvergreen contends, leads to the \"inescapable\" conclusion that\n\n\"Woodman has reserved too much discretionary income for herself,\n\nand too little disposable income to the Plan, due principally to\n\nthe inclusion of her expenditure for cigarettes and the lack of any\n\nmeaningful     sacrifice     in    pre-petition     levels    of   discretionary\n\nconsumption.\"\n\n              We do not agree that Evergreen urged the Bankruptcy Court\n\nto   assess    whether    Woodman's       aggregate    discretionary    expenses\n\nallowed her to exceed her basic needs including a reasonable\n\ncushion for recreation and exigencies.              As Evergreen acknowledges\n\nelsewhere     in    its   brief,    its    \"objection    to   confirmation   [of\n\n                                          -5-\n\fWoodman's plan] was limited to the 'expense of cigarettes issue.'\"\n\nWhile Evergreen's memorandum of law in support of its objection to\n\nconfirmation    noted    that    Woodman     had    \"already     expend[ed]   a\n\nsufficient amount on so-called 'lifestyle' items,\" it did not claim\n\nthat her aggregate discretionary expenditure was unreasonable.\n\nRather, as previously noted, it singled out Woodman's cigarette\n\nexpenses,   arguing     that    in   light   of    her   other   discretionary\n\nexpenditures, \"[a]ny additional amount for cigarettes is excessive\"\n\nand \"must be eliminated.\" It also \"urge[d] the [Bankruptcy] Court\n\nto go further to adopt a per se rule that any expenditure by a c.13\n\ndebtor for cigarettes is not 'reasonably necessary' for support and\n\nmaintenance.\"   Evergreen did not argue, as it does here, that the\n\nbankruptcy court was required as a matter of law to aggregate\n\nWoodman's discretionary expenses and assess the reasonableness of\n\nthat total figure in light of Woodman's basic needs and the monthly\n\ndividends paid to her unsecured creditors.2                Nor did Evergreen\n\n     2\n       The bankruptcy court rejected Evergreen's per se argument,\nwhich Evergreen does not challenge on appeal, as well as its claim\nthat taking into account other discretionary expenditures,\nWoodman's cigarette expenditures were excessive. In doing so, the\ncourt adopted an approach that was similar to Gonzales's case-by-\ncase analysis, explaining that\n     if the trustee or a creditor comes forward with evidence\n     that the debtor is not committing all available projected\n     disposable income to the plan as required by §\n     1325(b)(1), the court, without the aid of arbitrary,\n     bright line formulae, must scrutinize the debtor's budget\n     in view of the debtor's particular circumstances, and use\n     its best judgment to determine whether expenses other\n     than those that are \"reasonably necessary\" have been\n     improperly included in the disposable income calculus.\nApplying that approach, the bankruptcy court questioned whether\n\n                                      -6-\n\fadvance that claim in its appeal to the district court, choosing\n\ninstead to raise only the new \"objective factors\" claim of error.\n\nConsequently, the argument is twice forfeited. See In re Carp, 340\n\nF.3d at 25-26; Advanced Testing Tech., Inc. v. Desmond (In re\n\nComputer Eng'g Assoc., Inc., 337 F.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(creditor trustee \"forfeited its right to appeal the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's determination by failing to raise it on appeal to the\n\ndistrict court\").\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nEvergreen had produced sufficient evidence to require Woodman to\nestablish the reasonableness of her expenses by a preponderance of\nthe evidence but concluded that, in any event, Woodman had met that\nburden.\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

Woodman's First Amended Chapter 13 Plan (\"the plan\"). Evergreen objected to the confirmation of the plan on the ground that it did not meet the requirement set forth in &#167; 1325(b) that debtors devote all of their \"disposable income\" to their plans for at least three years. In particular, Evergreen claimed that Woodman's monthly purchases of cigarettes, amounting to $136.00, were not \"reasonably necessary\" expenses within the meaning of &#167; 1325(b)(2)(A). Thus, it argued that &#167; 1325(b) required the exclusion of Woodman's cigarette expenditures from the calculation of her reasonably necessary expenses, thereby increasing her projected disposable income and consequently the amount that she would be required to pay each month into the plan. The bankruptcy court, in a thoughtful rescript, overruled Evergreen's objection to the confirmation of the plan. <i>In re Woodman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1877381\"><a href=\"/opinion/1877381/in-re-woodman/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 596 (Bankr.D.Me.2003). Evergreen appealed, and the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's judgment. Adhering to our long-standing rule that arguments not squarely presented below may not be advanced for the first time on appeal, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evergreen contends that the bankruptcy court's analysis of whether cigarette expenses are disposable income was flawed because it did not include \"a rigorous review\" of \"objective factors\" relating to the reasonableness of Woodman's asserted need for cigarettes. Section 1325(b)(2)(A), Evergreen avers, required the court to consider such factors as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">whether the Debtor experiences any ill-health effects from her smoking, whether her physician has recommended that she cease smoking, how long she has smoked, the extent to which her consumption of cigarettes varies, the brands or brands she smokes, whether she wants to stop smoking, and the efforts she has made to quit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the bankruptcy court did not consider those factors, Evergreen argues, it erred as a matter of law in overruling Evergreen's objection to Woodman's cigarette expenses and confirming her Chapter 13 plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the bankruptcy trustee points out correctly in its response brief, Evergreen never asked the bankruptcy court to adopt the \"objective factors\" that it now claims should be applied to any analysis under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(2)(A). Instead, it argued that Woodman's cigarette expenses were excessive in the context of her other discretionary expenditures and that it was, furthermore, unreasonable <i>per se</i> since \"there is no redeeming value to smoking, and [the bankruptcy court] need not tolerate a debtor's behavior which is not only counterproductive but self-destructive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party's failure to advance an issue before the bankruptcy court in the first instance forfeits its right to raise that issue on appeal. <i>See Gannett v. Carp</i> (<i>In re Carp),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200602\"><a href=\"/opinion/200602/gannett-v-carp/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 25-26 (1st Cir.2003) (argument not raised before the bankruptcy court will not be considered on appeal); <i>LaRoche v.

We find no extraordinary circumstances in the record that would justify a departure from this well-established prudential rule. <i>See Nat'l Assoc.</i> <i>of Soc. Workers v.

Having failed to raise its \"objective factors\" argument before the bankruptcy court, Evergreen is foreclosed from advancing it on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evergreen further argues that the bankruptcy court committed a legal error by failing to aggregate all of Woodman's discretionary expenditures and assess the reasonable necessity of that total sum. It argues that the court should have applied the methodology adopted by the bankruptcy court in <i>In re Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1869292\"><a href=\"/opinion/1869292/in-re-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></a></span> (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1993). The <i>Gonzales</i> court explained that its task was</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">to identify how much of the Debtors' anticipated expenses are discretionary in nature and to weigh them on this scale. If the discretionary expenses in the aggregate allow the Debtors to exceed their basic needs, including a reasonable reserve for recreation and exigencies (the reasonable \"cushion\"), then their plan cannot be confirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 609. According to Evergreen, \"[t]he Bankruptcy Court below did not use this methodology ... despite being urged to do so by Evergreen, and thereby committed an error of law.\" Applying this aggregating methodology to Woodman's discretionary expenses, Evergreen contends, leads to the \"inescapable\" conclusion that \"Woodman has reserved too much discretionary income for herself, and too little disposable income to the Plan, due principally to the inclusion of her expenditure for cigarettes and the lack of any meaningful sacrifice in pre-petition levels of discretionary consumption.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree that Evergreen urged the Bankruptcy Court to assess whether Woodman's aggregate discretionary expenses allowed her to exceed her basic needs including a reasonable cushion for recreation and exigencies. As Evergreen acknowledges elsewhere in its brief, its \"objection to confirmation [of Woodman's plan] was limited to the `expense of cigarettes issue.'\" While Evergreen's memorandum of law in support of its objection to confirmation noted that Woodman had \"already expend[ed] a sufficient amount on so-called `lifestyle' items,\" it did not claim that her aggregate discretionary expenditure was unreasonable. Rather, as previously noted, it singled out Woodman's cigarette expenses, arguing that in light of her other discretionary expenditures, \"[a]ny additional amount for cigarettes is excessive\" and \"must be eliminated.\" It also \"urge[d] the [Bankruptcy] Court to go further to adopt a <i>per se</i> rule that any expenditure by a c. 13 debtor for cigarettes is not `reasonably necessary' for support and maintenance.\" Evergreen did not argue, as it does here, that the bankruptcy court was required as a matter of law to aggregate Woodman's discretionary expenses and assess the reasonableness of that total figure in light of Woodman's basic needs and the monthly dividends paid to her unsecured creditors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Nor did Evergreen advance that claim in its appeal to the district court, choosing instead to raise only the new \"objective factors\" claim of error. Consequently, the argument is twice forfeited. <i>See In re Carp,</i> 340 F.3d at 25-26; <i>Advanced Testing Tech., Inc. v. Desmond</i> (<i>In re Computer Eng'g Assoc., Inc.),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782834\"><a href=\"/opinion/782834/in-re-computer-engineering-associates-inc-debtor-advanced-testing/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2003) (creditor trustee \"forfeited its right to appeal the bankruptcy court's determination by failing to raise it on appeal to the district court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The Honorable John R.

That the district court chose to address this issue, however, does not preserve it for appeal to this court<i>See In re Carp,</i> 340 F.3d at 21 (\"Notwithstanding the fact that we are the second-in-time reviewers, we cede no special deference to the district court determinations.

In doing so, the court adopted an approach that was similar to <i>Gonzales's</i> case-by-case analysis, explaining that</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">if the trustee or a creditor comes forward with evidence that the debtor is not committing all available projected disposable income to the plan as required by &#167; 1325(b)(1), the court, without the aid of arbitrary, bright line formulae, must scrutinize the debtor's budget in view of the debtor's particular circumstances, and use its best judgment to determine whether expenses other than those that are \"reasonably necessary\" have been improperly included in the disposable income calculus.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Applying that approach, the bankruptcy court questioned whether Evergreen had produced sufficient evidence to require Woodman to establish the reasonableness of her expenses by a preponderance of the evidence but concluded that, in any event, Woodman had met that burden.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
