Restani, Chief Judge of the United\nStates Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.\n\f                 RESTANI,   Judge.      Plaintiffs-Appellants,    owners     of\n\nproperties located near La Marginal Beach in Puerto Rico, bring\n\nthis action pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\") for\n\ndamages to their homes resulting from the disposal of dredged\n\nmaterial on La Marginal Beach under the direction of the U.S. Corps\n\nof Engineers (\"Corps\").           Plaintiffs appeal the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of the United States holding\n\nthat       (1)   the   Corps'   disposal   activity   is   protected   by   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception to the FTCA, and (2) there is no\n\ncausal connection between the violation of a specific requirement\n\nand the injuries caused by the discharge of dredged material.                We\n\nagree with the district court that there is no jurisdiction for it\n\nto entertain this suit under the FTCA, and we affirm its judgment.\n\n                                     BACKGROUND1\n\n                 By public notice dated January 20, 1999, the Corps\n\nproposed emergency maintenance dredging involving approximately\n\n60,000 to 80,000 cubic yards of shoal material from the federally\n\nauthorized navigation channel in Arecibo Harbor.             For disposal of\n\nthe dredged material, the Corps proposed placement upland on Port\n\n\n\n       1\n      This case shares much of its factual background with a case\ndecided by the United States District Court for the District of\nPuerto Rico, Surf & Environment Conservation Coalition v. United\nStates, 322 F. Supp. 2d 126 (D.P.R. 2004), in which the district\ncourt determined that the Corps violated numerous provisions of the\nClean Water Act (\"CWA\") and Puerto Rico's Water Quality Standards\nRegulations (\"WQSR\") by discharging dredged material from Arecibo\nHarbor into open waters.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fAuthority    property,      with   nearshore    placement      as   the    next\n\nalternative.       By letter dated March 1, 1999, the Puerto Rico\n\nEnvironmental Quality Board (\"EQB\") required the Corps to submit\n\nadditional dredging project documentation and to obtain a water\n\nquality certificate.\n\n            In   response    the    Corps   submitted    an    Environmental\n\nAssessment, which increased the estimated cubic yards of dredged to\n\n150,000.     The    Assessment     explained   that   upland    disposal   was\n\ndiscarded because it was a more costly alternative.             Instead, the\n\nCorps concluded that\n\n     the material to be removed is considered suitable for\n     downdrift beach and shore nourishment. Erosion, partly\n     related to sea level rise, has been an ongoing problem\n     along the Arecibo coast for many years . . . Therefore,\n     it is appropriate and beneficial to dispose of the dredge\n     material back into the natural littoral drift of the\n     region.\n\n            By letter dated July 27, 1999, the Corps requested a\n\nwaiver of water quality certificate from the EQB for the nearshore\n\ndisposal of dredged material from Arecibo Harbor.             The EQB granted\n\nan exemption to the water quality certificate on August 6, 1999,\n\nfor deposit of the dredged material \"in the Arecibo river banks, in\n\norder to help combat the erosion problems that exist in the beaches\n\nalong the Arecibo coast.\" An environmental survey of the nearshore\n\ndisposal site revealed that the site consisted of hardbottom\n\nhabitats of invertebrates, fish, and marine reptiles, so the Corps\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\frevised its plan to beach only disposal.2\n\n               Nonetheless, on June 19, 2000, the Corps began disposal\n\nin the open waters of the United States, which had never been\n\nsuggested as an alternative.      Soon thereafter, disposal was halted\n\nbecause the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (\"USFWS\")\n\ndiscovered that the dredged material was being deposited on a coral\n\nhard-ground community.3       The Corps proposed a new disposal method\n\nalong the shoreline instead of the near-shore disposal site to\n\nminimize the impact to hardground habitats and potential marine\n\nlife.       By the July 2001 project completion date, almost all of the\n\ndredged material had been placed directly on La Marginal Beach, in\n\nfront of Paseo Victor Rojas and across from Plaintiffs' properties.\n\n\n        2\n      In Surf, the court found that by letter dated February 18,\n2000, the Corps sought to \"return[] to the plan originally\ndescribed in the public notice of early 1999 which entailed\ndisposal of dredge material via a pipeline to an existing beach and\nbeach placement of material.\" Surf, 322 F. Supp. 2d at 134. While\nthe court apparently concluded that La Marginal Beach was the new\nproposed beach disposal site, see id., the court did not find that\nthe Corps sought an exemption based on that disposal site.       In\nfact, the court described the Corps' August 6, 1999 EQB exemption\nfor the nearshore disposal site as the \"one and only resolution and\nnotice from the EQB . . . related to the exemption request for\nwater quality certification for the dredging of the Arecibo\nHarbor.\" Id. at 137.\n     3\n      Richard Bonner, the Corps official in charge, declares that,\nin response to the discovery of the hardbottom habitat, \"[w]ork was\nhalted while the Corps consulted with the [USFWS] and National\nMarine Fisheries Service, and obtained an exemption to the Water\nQuality Certificate from the Environmental Quality Board for Puerto\nRico, allowing disposal of sand on the beach itself.\" Despite this\nreference to an exemption pertaining to the dumping of sand on the\nbeach, no documentary evidence of such an exemption appears in the\nrecord appendix.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fAs a result, the beach height increased approximately fifteen feet\n\nalong the entire beach area and was leveled with Paseo Victor Rojas\n\nto an estimated width of 1000 feet.     The street was protected from\n\nblowing sand by a stone concrete wall and silt fence.\n\n           On September 25, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a complaint\n\npursuant to the provisions of the FTCA, alleging damages resulting\n\nfrom sand and dust carried from the Corps' disposal site.             The\n\ncomplaint alleged that the Corps discharged dredged materials in\n\nviolation of both the CWA and the WQSR because the Corps did not\n\nreceive a water quality certificate or an exemption from the EQB\n\nfor the specific disposal site as required by the WQSR.4\n\n           The government filed a motion for summary judgment on the\n\ngrounds   that   Plaintiffs'   FTCA   claims   are   precluded   by   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception to the FTCA and are not based on\n\nviable tort claims under Puerto Rico law.      While the court agreed\n\nwith Plaintiffs that \"local law establishes a permit or waiver\n\nrequirement from the Puerto Rico EQB for depositing [dredged\n\n\n     4\n      In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs describe the Corps'\ndisposal project as involving, \"the discharge of dredge materials\nin waters of the United States.\" Plaintiffs allege that the Corps\n\"disposed 196,000 cubic yards of dredged material . . . in an area\nclose to the shore.\" While such language could refer to either\nbeach or open water disposal in describing the cause of their\ndamages, Plaintiffs state that \"[t]he project was finish[ed] on or\nabout July 6, 2000 and the dredged material was left \"exposed to\nthe strong winds that regularly occur in the area.\"      Moreover,\nPlaintiffs state that the damages have ceased because \"the waves\nand wind have removed almost all the sand and fine sediment from\nthe place where the material was disposed.\" Thus, the complaint\nseems to claim damages from beach placement alone.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fmaterial] along the Arecibo coastline,\" it did not agree \"that this\n\ncondition   totally   abrogates   the    discretion   envisioned   in   §\n\n2680(a).\"   Montijo-Reyes v. United States, No. 01-2282, slip. op.\n\nat 10 (D.P.R. Dec. 13, 2004).           The court concluded that the\n\ndiscretionary function exception applied because \"the permit or\n\nwaiver requirement was but one of many factors that the Corps had\n\nto take into its calculus in making its site selection.\"             Id.\n\nMoreover, the court concluded that Plaintiffs did not show \"the\n\nnecessary causal connection between the Corps' failure to comply\n\nwith the [CWA] and the losses complained of in the complaint.\"       Id.\n\nat 11.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nI.          Clean Water    Act    and   Puerto   Rico   Water   Quality\n            Requirements\n\n            The CWA makes it unlawful to discharge pollutants into\n\nnavigable waters outside of the CWA's permit requirements.         See 33\n\nU.S.C. § 1311(a) (2000).     In order to receive a CWA permit, an\n\napplicant must provide a certification \"from the State in which the\n\ndischarge originates or will originate.\"      Id. § 1341(a)(1); see 33\n\nC.F.R. § 336.1(a)(1), (8) (the CWA requires the Corps to seek state\n\nwater quality certification for discharges of dredged or fill\n\nmaterial into waters of the United States).5     Additional provisions\n\n\n\n     5\n     The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is treated as a state for\npurposes of the CWA. See Caribbean Petroleum Corp. v. EPA, 28 F.3d\n232, 233 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                  -6-\n\fof   the   CWA    make    it   clear   that    \"Congress   waived       the   federal\n\ngovernment's sovereign immunity with respect to state regulation of\n\ndredging and water pollution.\"                Friends of the Earth v. United\n\nStates Navy, 841 F.2d 927, 934 (9th Cir. 1988).                   Section 1344(t)\n\nprovides:\n\n            Nothing in this section shall preclude . . . the\n            right of any State . . . agency to control the\n            discharge of dredged or fill material in . . . the\n            navigable waters within the jurisdiction of such\n            State, including any activity of any Federal\n            agency, and each such agency shall comply with such\n            State or interstate requirements both substantive\n            and procedural to control the discharge of dredged\n            or fill material to the same extent that any person\n            is subject to such requirements.\n\n33 U.S.C. § 1344(t).           Section 1323 provides:\n\n            Each [federal agency] . . . shall . . . comply\n            with, all Federal, State, interstate, and local\n            requirements, administrative authority, and process\n            and sanctions respecting the control and abatement\n            of water pollution in the same manner, and to the\n            same extent as any nongovernmental agency . . .\n            [This] shall apply (A) to any requirement whether\n            substantive or procedural (including . . . any\n            requirement respecting permits and any other\n            requirement, whatsoever).\n\nId. § 1323(a).\n\n            The WQSR states that it was promulgated by the EQB in\n\naccordance       with    the   Environmental     Policy    Act,    in    order   \"to\n\npreserve, maintain and enhance the quality of the waters of Puerto\n\nRico in such manner that they be compatible with the social and\n\neconomic needs of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"                 WQSR Decl. of\n\nGoals & Purposes.         To meet this goal, the WQSR requires a water\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fquality certificate prior to the discharge of pollutants into\n\nPuerto Rico's waters, WQSR Art. 6.1.2, 6.11, unless the EQB grants\n\nan exemption under WQSR Art. 6.1.3.\n\n          In the instant case, we do not determine whether the\n\nCorps violated the CWA and WQSR by discharging dredged material\n\nfrom Arecibo Harbor on La Marginal Beach.   We do not need to decide\n\nany issue of the scope of the CWA waiver of sovereign immunity, or\n\nwhether that waiver extends to actions under the FTCA.    Neither do\n\nwe need to decide whether state law may provide a mandatory duty\n\nsuch as to defeat the discretionary function exception.    Instead,\n\nwe decide the case on the independent ground that there is an\n\ninsufficient causal link between the alleged failure to comply with\n\nthe Puerto Rico water quality regulations and the alleged harm.\n\nII.       Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n          The FTCA provides a limited waiver of the United States\n\ngovernment's sovereign immunity \"for injury or loss of property\n\n. . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any\n\nemployee of the Government . . . under circumstances where the\n\nUnited States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant\n\nin accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission\n\noccurred.\"   28 U.S.C. § 1346(b) (2000).    This waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity itself has exceptions, which \"define the limits of federal\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction in this area.\" Hydrogen Tech. Corp. v.\n\nUnited States, 831 F.2d 1155, 1161 (1st Cir. 1987).    We review de\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fnovo a district court's dismissal for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction under the FTCA's discretionary function exception.\n\nSee Shansky v. United States, 164 F.3d 688, 690 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            The   discretionary     function     exception    immunizes the\n\nfederal government from FTCA claims \"based upon the exercise or\n\nperformance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary\n\nfunction or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of\n\nthe Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\"\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).      The basis for the discretionary function\n\nexception     was    Congress'      desire       to    \"prevent       judicial\n\n'second-guessing'    of   legislative     and   administrative    decisions\n\ngrounded in social, economic, and political policy through the\n\nmedium of an action in tort.\"        United States v. S.A. Empresa De\n\nViacao Aerea Rio Grandense (Varig Airlines), 467 U.S. 797, 814\n\n(1984).\n\n            In considering the application of the exception, first,\n\nthe court must identify the conduct at issue.          Next, the court asks\n\ntwo   interrelated     questions:     \"(1)      Is    the   conduct    itself\n\ndiscretionary? (2) If so, does the exercise of discretion involve\n\n(or is it susceptible to) policy-related judgments?\"           Muniz-Rivera\n\nv. United States, 326 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 2003); see Attallah v.\n\nUnited States, 955 F.2d 776, 783 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"even when the\n\nchallenged action is the product of an employee's permissible use\n\nof judgment, a suit is barred only if that judgment is of the kind\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fthat the discretionary function exception was designed to shield\").\n\nIf the conduct is both discretionary and policy-related, the\n\ndiscretionary function exception bars subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n                Plaintiffs bring this FTCA action alleging that the Corps\n\nnegligently discharged dredged material on La Marginal Beach, which\n\nproximately caused damages to their homes.6                  Plaintiffs do not\n\ndispute that the Corps' selection and maintenance of the disposal\n\nsite       at   La    Marginal   Beach   are   susceptible   to   policy   related\n\njudgments.7           Rather, in order to overcome the application of the\n\nFTCA's discretionary function exception, Plaintiffs argue that the\n\ndischarge            of   dredged   material     on   La   Marginal   Beach    was\n\nnondiscretionary because the CWA mandated a course of conduct for\n\nthe Corps to follow before disposing of dredged material.\n\n\n       6\n     Plaintiffs contend that the government conduct giving rise to\nthe claim in question is \"the discharge of dredged material in\nnavigable waters\" without necessary water quality permits. This\nbroad assertion of conduct may cause some confusion because it\npotentially covers two distinct actions: (1) open waters disposal,\nand (2) direct disposal on La Marginal Beach.        Clearly, each\ndischarge was a distinct occurrence, with distinct consequences and\nregulatory requirements. As indicated above, see supra n.4., the\ndamages alleged in the complaint appear to derive from the direct\nbeach placement alone.\n       7\n      \"[T]he law presumes that the exercise of official discretion\nimplicates policy judgments,\" so Plaintiffs \"bear[] the burden . .\n. of demonstrating that the [Corps'] conduct was not at least\nsusceptible to policy related judgments.\" Wood v. United States,\n290 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir. 2002). Here, Plaintiffs do not attempt\nto make this showing. To the contrary, the record shows that the\nArecibo Harbor dredging project involved the Corps' consideration\nof four distinct disposal choices, each of which required decisions\ninvolving political, economic, and public policy considerations.\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f     [T]he discretionary function exception will not apply\n     when   a  federal    statute,   regulation,   or   policy\n     specifically prescribes a course of action for an\n     employee to follow. In this event, the employee has no\n     rightful option but to adhere to the directive. And if\n     the employee's conduct cannot appropriately be the\n     product of judgment or choice, then there is no\n     discretion in the conduct for the discretionary exception\n     to protect.\n\nBerkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988).\n\n          Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the Corps violated\n\nthe CWA's prescription to comply with all state water quality\n\nrequirements.   Plaintiffs assert that under Puerto Rico law, the\n\nCorps was required to obtain a water quality certificate or waiver\n\nfrom the EQB prior to disposing dredged material into Puerto Rico's\n\nwaters.   In this case, on August 6, 1999, the EQB granted the\n\nCorps' exemption request for disposal of dredged material in the\n\nArecibo river banks.     Thereafter, the Corps disposed of dredged\n\nmaterial at two sites not approved in the exemption request.\n\nPlaintiffs contend that when the Corps discharged dredged material\n\noutside the scope of its EQB waiver, it violated a nondiscretionary\n\nduty imposed by the CWA to comply with all Puerto Rico water\n\nquality requirements.8\n\n\n     8\n      This argument involves an issue of first impression in this\ncircuit as to whether a state regulation can prescribe the conduct\nof a federal agency to defeat the discretionary function exception.\nWhile this line of argument has some precedent, see, e.g., Lopez v.\nUnited States, 376 F.3d 1055, 1058 (10th Cir. 2004)(stating that a\nUnited States Postal Service regulation requiring mailboxes to be\n\"placed to conform to state laws\" is a nondiscretionary mandate for\nthe United States Postal Service to relocate mailboxes that are\n                                                     (continued...)\n\n                                -11-\n\f              While the CWA, in combination with the WQSR, specifically\n\nrequires that the Corps obtain a certificate or waiver prior to\n\ndischarging dredged material in navigable waters, Plaintiffs do not\n\nallege that the Corps' failure to obtain a certificate or waiver\n\ncaused the damages to their homes.              Reviewing the complaint,\n\nPlaintiffs allege that with knowledge of the constant wind at La\n\nMarginal Beach, the Corps discharged fine sand without adequate\n\nprotection.        Thus, the harm to Plaintiffs' homes was allegedly\n\ncaused by either negligent disposal site selection or negligent\n\nmaintenance of the disposal site. We hold that Plaintiffs' failure\n\nto   obtain    a   water   quality     certificate   or   exemption   did    not\n\nproximately cause this harm.\n\n              First, Plaintiffs do not allege that the EQB would have\n\nrejected an exemption request by the Corps for disposal on La\n\nMarginal Beach.      Therefore, the Corps' failure to follow the CWA's\n\nmandate to comply with state law does not even pass the but for\n\ncausation test.       Second, neither the CWA nor the WQSR provide any\n\nprescription aimed at preventing private property damage arising\n\nfrom negligent site selection or site maintenance.               See Shansky,\n\n164 F.3d at 691 (holding that Park Service Operating Manual was too\n\ngeneral   because     it   did   not   \"specifically      prescribe   that   any\n\nparticular safety measure be employed at any particular place or in\n\n\n\n      8\n     (...continued)\nplaced in violation of state law), we do not reach this issue here.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fany particular facility\").\n\n             As to the site selection, the Corps made a discretionary\n\ndecision to select La Marginal Beach.                If the Corps had requested\n\nan EQB exemption, the WQSR would not have required the EQB to\n\nreject that site selection.             As to the Corps' maintenance of the\n\nbeach disposal site, the Corps made discretionary decisions to\n\nbuild the beach to a specific height and to protect nearby private\n\nproperty by installing a concrete wall and a silt fence.                   The WQSR\n\ndoes not prescribe any specific measures for maintaining a beach\n\ndisposal     site,    or    authorize    the   EQB    to   reject   an    exemption\n\napplication based on inadequate site maintenance. Thus, whether or\n\nnot the Corps obtained a water quality certificate or exemption,\n\nthe negligent conduct that allegedly caused Plaintiffs' damages was\n\nnot forbidden.\n\n             The legislative intent behind the CWA and WQSR supports\n\nthis limited interpretation.            The stated purpose of the CWA is \"to\n\nrestore    and   maintain      the   chemical,       physical,    and    biological\n\nintegrity of the Nation's waters.\"             33 U.S.C. § 1251(a).

Accordingly, we hold that\n\nthe   CWA   and   WQSR    do   not   overcome     the   discretionary     function\n\nexemption where, as here, Plaintiffs fail to allege a causal\n\nconnection between the Corps' failure to comply with the CWA and\n\nWQSR and the purported damages for which they seek recovery under\n\nthe FTCA.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n            For    the     foregoing     reasons,       we   conclude    that   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception of the FTCA applies to bar subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction to consider the Plaintiffs' action for damages\n\ncaused by the Corps' disposal of dredged material at La Marginal\n\nBeach.

Plaintiffs appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the United States holding that (1) the Corps' disposal activity is protected by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA, and (2) there is no causal connection between the violation of a specific requirement and the injuries caused by the discharge of dredged material. We agree with the district court that there is no jurisdiction for it to entertain this suit under the FTCA, and we affirm its judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By public notice dated January 20, 1999, the Corps proposed emergency maintenance dredging involving approximately 60,000 to 80,000 cubic yards of shoal material from the federally authorized navigation channel in Arecibo Harbor. For disposal of the dredged material, the Corps proposed placement upland on Port Authority property, with nearshore placement as the next alternative. By letter dated March 1, 1999, the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (\"EQB\") required the Corps to submit additional dredging project documentation and to obtain a water quality certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response the Corps submitted an Environmental Assessment, which increased the estimated cubic yards of dredged to 150,000. The Assessment explained that upland disposal was discarded because it was a more costly alternative. Instead, the Corps concluded that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the material to be removed is considered suitable for downdrift beach and shore nourishment. Erosion, partly related to sea level rise, has been an ongoing problem along the Arecibo coast for many years . . . Therefore, it is appropriate and beneficial to dispose of the dredge material back into the natural littoral drift of the region.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated July 27, 1999, the Corps requested a waiver of water quality certificate from the EQB for the nearshore disposal of dredged material from Arecibo Harbor. The EQB granted an exemption to the water quality certificate on August 6, 1999, for deposit of the dredged material \"in the Arecibo river banks, in order to help combat the erosion problems that exist in the beaches along the Arecibo coast.\" An environmental survey of the nearshore disposal site revealed that the site consisted of hardbottom habitats of invertebrates, fish, and marine reptiles, so the Corps revised its plan to beach only disposal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, on June 19, 2000, the Corps began disposal in the open waters of the United States, which had never been suggested as an alternative. Soon thereafter, disposal was halted because the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (\"USFWS\") discovered that the dredged material was being deposited on a coral hard-ground community.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Corps proposed a new disposal method along the shoreline instead of the near-shore disposal site to minimize the impact to hard-ground habitats and potential marine life. By the July 2001 project completion date, almost all of the dredged material had been placed directly on La Marginal Beach, in front of Paseo Victor Rojas and across from Plaintiffs' properties. As a result, the beach height increased approximately fifteen feet along the entire beach area and was leveled with Paseo Victor Rojas to an estimated width of 1000 feet. The street was protected from blowing sand by a stone concrete wall and silt fence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 25, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a complaint pursuant to the provisions of the FTCA, alleging damages resulting from sand and dust carried from the Corps' disposal site. The complaint alleged that the Corps discharged dredged materials in violation of both the CWA and the WQSR because the Corps did not receive a water quality certificate or an exemption from the EQB for the specific disposal site as required by the WQSR.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Plaintiffs' FTCA claims are precluded by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA and are not based on viable tort claims under Puerto Rico law. While the court agreed with Plaintiffs that \"local law establishes a permit or waiver requirement from the Puerto Rico EQB for depositing [dredged material] along the Arecibo coastline,\" it did not agree \"that this condition totally abrogates the discretion envisioned in &#167; 2680(a).\" <i>Montijo-Reyes v. United States,</i> 349 F.Supp.2d 234, 239 (D.P.R.2004). The court concluded that the discretionary function exception applied because \"the permit or waiver requirement was but one of many factors that the Corps had to take into its calculus in making its site selection.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, the court concluded that Plaintiffs did not show \"the necessary causal connection between the Corps' failure to comply with the [CWA] and the losses complained of in the complaint.\" <i>Id.</i> at 240.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I.

Neither do we need to decide whether state law may provide a mandatory duty such as to defeat the discretionary function exception.

Plaintiffs assert that under Puerto Rico law, the Corps was required to obtain a water quality certificate or waiver from the EQB prior to disposing dredged material into Puerto Rico's waters. In this case, on August 6, 1999, the EQB granted the Corps' exemption request for disposal of dredged material in the Arecibo river banks. Thereafter, the Corps disposed of dredged material at two sites not approved in the exemption request. Plaintiffs contend that when the Corps discharged dredged material outside the scope of its EQB waiver, it violated a nondiscretionary duty imposed by the CWA to comply with all Puerto Rico water quality requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the CWA, in combination with the WQSR, specifically requires that the Corps obtain a certificate or waiver prior to discharging dredged material in navigable waters, Plaintiffs do not allege that the Corps' failure to obtain a certificate or waiver caused the damages to their homes. Reviewing the complaint, Plaintiffs allege that with knowledge of the constant wind at La Marginal Beach, the Corps discharged fine sand without adequate protection. Thus, the harm to Plaintiffs' homes was allegedly caused by either negligent disposal site selection or negligent maintenance of the disposal site. We hold that Plaintiffs' failure to obtain a water quality certificate or exemption did not proximately cause this harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Plaintiffs do not allege that the EQB would have rejected an exemption request by the Corps for disposal on La Marginal Beach. Therefore, the Corps' failure to follow the CWA's mandate to comply with state law does not even pass the but for causation test. Second, neither the CWA nor the WQSR provide any prescription aimed at preventing private property damage arising from negligent site selection or site maintenance. <i>See Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 691 (holding that Park Service Operating Manual was too general because it did not \"specifically prescribe that any particular safety measure be employed at any particular place or in any particular facility\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the site selection, the Corps made a discretionary decision to select La Marginal Beach. If the Corps had requested an EQB exemption, the WQSR would not have required the EQB to reject that site selection. As to the Corps' maintenance of the beach disposal site, the Corps made discretionary decisions to build the beach to a specific height and to protect nearby private property by installing a concrete wall and a silt fence. The WQSR does not prescribe any specific measures for maintaining a beach disposal site, or authorize the EQB to reject an exemption application based on inadequate site maintenance. Thus, whether or not the Corps obtained a water quality certificate or exemption, the negligent conduct that allegedly caused Plaintiffs' damages was not forbidden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative intent behind the CWA and WQSR supports this limited interpretation. The stated purpose of the CWA is \"to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a). Section 401 shows that \"Congress intended to give the states veto power over the grant of federal permit authority for activities potentially affecting a state's water quality.\" <i>United States v. Marathon Dev. Corp.,</i> 867 F.2d 96, 99-100 (1st Cir.1989). The WQSR's stated purpose is \"to preserve, maintain and enhance the quality of the waters of Puerto Rico.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> WQSR Decl. of Goals &amp; Purposes. There is nothing in the CWA or WQSR that indicates a legislative intent to protect private homes from the indirect effects of dredged material disposal. Accordingly, we hold that the CWA and WQSR do not overcome the discretionary function exemption where, as here, Plaintiffs fail to allege a causal connection between the Corps' failure to comply with the CWA and WQSR and the purported damages for which they seek recovery under the FTCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the discretionary function exception of the FTCA applies to bar subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Plaintiffs' action for damages caused by the Corps' disposal of dredged material at La Marginal Beach.

Plaintiffs appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the United States holding that (1) the Corps' disposal activity is protected by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA, and (2) there is no causal connection between the violation of a specific requirement and the injuries caused by the discharge of dredged material. We agree with the district court that there is no jurisdiction for it to entertain this suit under the FTCA, and we affirm its judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By public notice dated January 20, 1999, the Corps proposed emergency maintenance dredging involving approximately 60,000 to 80,000 cubic yards of shoal material from the federally authorized navigation channel in Arecibo Harbor. For disposal of the dredged material, the Corps proposed placement upland on Port Authority property, with nearshore placement as the next alternative. By letter dated March 1, 1999, the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (\"EQB\") required the Corps to submit additional dredging project documentation and to obtain a water quality certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response the Corps submitted an Environmental Assessment, which increased the estimated cubic yards of dredged to 150,000. The Assessment explained that upland disposal was discarded because it was a more costly alternative. Instead, the Corps concluded that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the material to be removed is considered suitable for downdrift beach and shore nourishment. Erosion, partly related to sea level rise, has been an ongoing problem along the Arecibo coast for many years . . . Therefore, it is appropriate and beneficial to dispose of the dredge material back into the natural littoral drift of the region.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated July 27, 1999, the Corps requested a waiver of water quality certificate from the EQB for the nearshore disposal of dredged material from Arecibo Harbor. The EQB granted an exemption to the water quality certificate on August 6, 1999, for deposit of the dredged material \"in the Arecibo river banks, in order to help combat the erosion problems that exist in the beaches along the Arecibo coast.\" An environmental survey of the nearshore disposal site revealed that the site consisted of hardbottom habitats of invertebrates, fish, and marine reptiles, so the Corps revised its plan to beach only disposal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, on June 19, 2000, the Corps began disposal in the open waters of the United States, which had never been suggested as an alternative. Soon thereafter, disposal was halted because the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (\"USFWS\") discovered that the dredged material was being deposited on a coral hard-ground community.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Corps proposed a new disposal method along the shoreline instead of the near-shore disposal site to minimize the impact to hard-ground habitats and potential marine life. By the July 2001 project completion date, almost all of the dredged material had been placed directly on La Marginal Beach, in front of Paseo Victor Rojas and across from Plaintiffs' properties. As a result, the beach height increased approximately fifteen feet along the entire beach area and was leveled with Paseo Victor Rojas to an estimated width of 1000 feet. The street was protected from blowing sand by a stone concrete wall and silt fence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 25, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a complaint pursuant to the provisions of the FTCA, alleging damages resulting from sand and dust carried from the Corps' disposal site. The complaint alleged that the Corps discharged dredged materials in violation of both the CWA and the WQSR because the Corps did not receive a water quality certificate or an exemption from the EQB for the specific disposal site as required by the WQSR.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Plaintiffs' FTCA claims are precluded by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA and are not based on viable tort claims under Puerto Rico law. While the court agreed with Plaintiffs that \"local law establishes a permit or waiver requirement from the Puerto Rico EQB for depositing [dredged material] along the Arecibo coastline,\" it did not agree \"that this condition totally abrogates the discretion envisioned in &#167; 2680(a).\" <i>Montijo-Reyes v.

Plaintiffs assert that under Puerto Rico law, the Corps was required to obtain a water quality certificate or waiver from the EQB prior to disposing dredged material into Puerto Rico's waters. In this case, on August 6, 1999, the EQB granted the Corps' exemption request for disposal of dredged material in the Arecibo river banks. Thereafter, the Corps disposed of dredged material at two sites not approved in the exemption request. Plaintiffs contend that when the Corps discharged dredged material outside the scope of its EQB waiver, it violated a nondiscretionary duty imposed by the CWA to comply with all Puerto Rico water quality requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the CWA, in combination with the WQSR, specifically requires that the Corps obtain a certificate or waiver prior to discharging dredged material in navigable waters, Plaintiffs do not allege that the Corps' failure to obtain a certificate or waiver caused the damages to their homes. Reviewing the complaint, Plaintiffs allege that with knowledge of the constant wind at La Marginal Beach, the Corps discharged fine sand without adequate protection. Thus, the harm to Plaintiffs' homes was allegedly caused by either negligent disposal site selection or negligent maintenance of the disposal site. We hold that Plaintiffs' failure to obtain a water quality certificate or exemption did not proximately cause this harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Plaintiffs do not allege that the EQB would have rejected an exemption request by the Corps for disposal on La Marginal Beach. Therefore, the Corps' failure to follow the CWA's mandate to comply with state law does not even pass the but for causation test. Second, neither the CWA nor the WQSR provide any prescription aimed at preventing private property damage arising from negligent site selection or site maintenance. <i>See Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 691 (holding that Park Service Operating Manual was too general because it did not \"specifically prescribe that any particular safety measure be employed at any particular place or in any particular facility\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the site selection, the Corps made a discretionary decision to select La Marginal Beach. If the Corps had requested an EQB exemption, the WQSR would not have required the EQB to reject that site selection. As to the Corps' maintenance of the beach disposal site, the Corps made discretionary decisions to build the beach to a specific height and to protect nearby private property by installing a concrete wall and a silt fence. The WQSR does not prescribe any specific measures for maintaining a beach disposal site, or authorize the EQB to reject an exemption application based on inadequate site maintenance. Thus, whether or not the Corps obtained a water quality certificate or exemption, the negligent conduct that allegedly caused Plaintiffs' damages was not forbidden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative intent behind the CWA and WQSR supports this limited interpretation. The stated purpose of the CWA is \"to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a).

The WQSR's stated purpose is \"to preserve, maintain and enhance the quality of the waters of Puerto Rico.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> WQSR Decl. of Goals &amp; Purposes. There is nothing in the CWA or WQSR that indicates a legislative intent to protect private homes from the indirect effects of dredged material disposal. Accordingly, we hold that the CWA and WQSR do not overcome the discretionary function exemption where, as here, Plaintiffs fail to allege a causal connection between the Corps' failure to comply with the CWA and WQSR and the purported damages for which they seek recovery under the FTCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the discretionary function exception of the FTCA applies to bar subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Plaintiffs' action for damages caused by the Corps' disposal of dredged material at La Marginal Beach. To the extent that Plaintiffs assert that the CWA specifically prescribes the Corps' course of conduct, Plaintiffs do not allege a causal connection between the violation and their asserted damages.

While the court apparently concluded that La Marginal Beach was the new proposed beach disposal site, <i>see id.,</i> the court did not find that the Corps sought an exemption based on that disposal site. In fact, the court described the Corps' August 6, 1999 EQB exemption for the nearshore disposal site as the \"one and only resolution and notice from the EQB . . . related to the exemption request for water quality certification for the dredging of the Arecibo Harbor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 137.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Richard Bonner, the Corps official in charge, declares that, in response to the discovery of the hardbottom habitat, \"[w]ork was halted while the Corps consulted with the [USFWS] and National Marine Fisheries Service, and obtained an exemption to the Water Quality Certificate from the Environmental Quality Board for Puerto Rico, allowing disposal of sand on the beach itself.\" Despite this reference to an exemption pertaining to the dumping of sand on the beach, no documentary evidence of such an exemption appears in the record appendix</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs describe the Corps' disposal project as involving, \"the discharge of dredge materials in waters of the United States.\" Plaintiffs allege that the Corps \"disposed 196,000 cubic yards of dredged material . . . in an area close to the shore.\" While such language could refer to either beach or open water disposal in describing the cause of their damages, Plaintiffs state that \"[t]he project was finish[ed] on or about July 6, 2000\" and the dredged material was left \"exposed to the strong winds that regularly occur in the area.\" Moreover, Plaintiffs state that the damages have ceased because \"the waves and wind have removed almost all the sand and fine sediment from the place where the material was disposed.\" Thus, the complaint seems to claim damages from beach placement alone</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is treated as a state for purposes of the CWA<i>See Caribbean Petroleum Corp. v.

This broad assertion of conduct may cause some confusion because it potentially covers two distinct actions: (1) open waters disposal, and (2) direct disposal on La Marginal Beach. Clearly, each discharge was a distinct occurrence, with distinct consequences and regulatory requirements. As indicated above,<i>see</i> supra n. 4., the damages alleged in the complaint appear to derive from the direct beach placement alone.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> \"[T]he law presumes that the exercise of official discretion implicates policy judgments,\" so Plaintiffs \"bear[] the burden . . . of demonstrating that the [Corps'] conduct was not at least susceptible to policy related judgments.\"<i>Wood v.
