Appellant Ivan Sanchez-Perez pled guilty to\n               \n\nunlawful  possession  in  a  vessel  of   approximately  34.5\n\nkilograms of  cocaine, and  of aiding  and abetting  same, in\n\nviolation of  21 U.S.C.    955  and 18 U.S.C.    2.   He  was\n\nsentenced to a  term of  170 months imprisonment,  a fine  of\n\n$10,050,  and  a  five  year period  of  supervised  release.\n\nAppellant did not file  a direct appeal.  Instead,  he sought\n\nto vacate his sentence  pursuant to 28 U.S.C.    2255 on  the\n\ngrounds that (1) the imposition  of the fine was a denial  of\n\nhis  fifth  amendment  right to  due  process  of  law and  a\n\nviolation of the  eighth amendment prohibition  against cruel\n\nand  unusual  punishment; and  (2)  he  was denied  effective\n\nassistance of counsel because his attorney did not object  to\n\nthe  imposition  of  the  fine  and  because  the  attorney's\n\nrepresentation  of  a  co-defendant  caused   a  conflict  of\n\ninterest.    We  affirm  the district  court's  dismissal  of\n\nappellant's petition.\n\n     Appellant  asserts that  the court  erred in  imposing a\n\nfine upon him because  (1) he was indigent and  therefore was\n\nexempt from a fine;  (2) the fine was unduly  burdensome upon\n\nhim  and his daughter to whom he is obligated to provide $200\n\nper  month  in  child support;  and  (3)  the  court made  no\n\nspecific findings of  the reasons  for the fine.   We  review\n\nimposition of  fines only for  abuse of  discretion.   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 620 (1st Cir. 1993).  \n                \n\n                             -2-\n\n      The court did  not abuse its  discretion in imposing  a\n\nfine.  According to the  guidelines in effect at the  time of\n\nappellant's sentencing,  the court  was required to  impose a\n\nfine unless  a defendant established that \"he  [wa]s not able\n\nand, even with  the use of a  reasonable installment schedule\n\n[wa]s not  likely to become  able to pay  all or part  of the\n                                 \n\nfine required by the  preceding provisions, or (2) imposition\n\nof a  fine would  unduly burden the  defendant's dependents.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   5E4.2(f) (1988) (emphasis  added).1   Hence, under\n\nthe guidelines, \"a  fine is the  rule--and it is  defendant's\n\nburden  to  demonstrate  that  his  case  is  an  exception.\"\n\nSavoie, 985  F.2d at  620.   Although the  presentence report\n      \n\nstated that appellant did  not appear to have the  ability to\n\npay  a fine,  it also  reflected that  appellant was  in good\n\nphysical  and  emotional  health,  possessed  a  high  school\n\ndiploma, was employed at the time of his arrest, and had been\n\nemployed,  at least temporarily,  for most  of the  past five\n\nyears.2   These uncontested  facts support a  conclusion that\n\nappellant  has the earning capacity  to become able  to pay a\n\nfine.  See  United States  v. Hagmann, 950  F.2d 175,  185-86\n                                     \n\n(5th Cir.  1991) (indigency  at time  of sentencing  does not\n\npreclude  imposition of  fine), cert.  denied, 113  S.Ct. 108\n                                             \n\n                    \n\n1.  The applicable  provision of the current  guideline is to\nthe same effect.  See U.S.S.G.   5E1.2(f).\n                     \n\n2.  The PSI  also indicated that  appellant had  unencumbered\nassets of $2,000.\n\n                             -3-\n\n(1992).    Moreover,  appellant  has  failed  to  adduce  any\n\nevidence  either that  he  is  unable,  with  the  use  of  a\n\nreasonable installment  schedule,3 to  pay the fine,  or that\n\nhis  daughter has  been unduly  burdened as  a result  of the\n\npayments  he  has  been  required  to  make.    See  U.S.S.G.\n                                                   \n\n 5E4.2(f) (defendant bears burden  of establishing that he is\n\nnot able to  pay fine with reasonable installment schedule or\n\nthat fine would unduly burden dependent).\n\n     Nor was  the fine unduly burdensome.  In determining the\n\namount of the fine, the court was required to consider, inter\n                                                             \n\nalia,   \"the  ability  of  the  defendant  to  pay  the  fine\n    \n\n(including his ability to pay over a period of time) in light\n\nof  his earning  capacity and  financial resources\";  and (2)\n\n\"the burden  that the fine places  on . . .  his dependents.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.  5E4.2(d).   However,  the court must  also consider\n\n\"the  need   for  the   combined  sentence  to   reflect  the\n\nseriousness of the offense, . . .  to promote respect for the\n\nlaw,  to  provide  just  punishment and  to  afford  adequate\n\ndeterrence.\"    Id.   In  light  of  the evidence  supporting\n                  \n\nappellant's  earning capacity and the lack of evidence of any\n\neffect  on appellant's  daughter, we  think that  the court's\n\nimposition of  a fine beneath the $17,500  minimum called for\n\n                    \n\n3.  According to the unopposed  statement of the  government,\nappellant is currently  required to pay  less than $6.00  per\nmonth.   Furthermore, since appellant's fine  is not a stand-\ncommitted fine,  failure to  make the required  payments will\nnot delay his release from prison.\n\n                             -4-\n\nby the guidelines4  is adequate indication  that it took  all\n\nthese factors into  account.   See Hagmann, 950  F.2d at  185\n                                          \n\n(imposition of only fraction of maximum possible fine implies\n\nthat court took into account defendant's ability to pay).  \n\n     Furthermore, since the record  indicates that the  court\n\ndid consider defendant's ability to pay and is  sufficient to\n\nallow for adequate appellate review, the sentencing court was\n\nnot  required  to make  specific  findings  or delineate  its\n\nreasons for imposing the fine  it did.  See Savoie, 985  F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 620; United  States v. Wilfred  American Educ. Corp.,  953\n                                                      \n\nF.2d 717, 719-20 (1st Cir. 1992).  \n\n     Finally, given that  we find no error  in the imposition\n\nof  the   fine  upon  appellant,  we  reject   his  claim  of\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel  insofar as that  claim is\n\npredicated on  counsel's alleged errors in  failing to object\n\nto the fine. To the extent appellant's claim is predicated on\n\ncounsel's  alleged  conflict  of  interest,  we  affirm   its\n\ndismissal essentially for the  reasons stated by the district\n\ncourt in its opinion and order dated August 2, 1993.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                    \n\n4.  The guidelines called for a maximum fine of $4,000,000.\n\n                             -5-\n",

Moreover, appellant has failed to adduce any evidence either that he is unable, with the use of a reasonable installment schedule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to pay the fine, or that his daughter has been unduly burdened as a result of the payments he has been required to make.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5E4.2(f) (defendant bears burden of establishing that he is not able to pay fine with reasonable installment schedule or that fine would unduly burden dependent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was the fine unduly burdensome.  In determining the amount of the fine, the court was required to consider, inter alia, \"the ability of the defendant to pay the fine (including his ability to pay over a period of time) in light of his earning capacity and financial resources\";  and (2) \"the burden that the fine places on ... his dependents.\"  U.S.S.G. Sec. 5E4.2(d).  However, the court must also consider \"the need for the combined sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, ... to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment and to afford adequate deterrence.\"  Id. In light of the evidence supporting appellant's earning capacity and the lack of evidence of any effect on appellant's daughter, we think that the court's imposition of a fine beneath the $17,500 minimum called for by the guidelines<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> is adequate indication that it took all these factors into account.   See Hagmann, 950 F.2d at 185 (imposition of only fraction of maximum possible fine implies that court took into account defendant's ability to pay).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, since the record indicates that the court did consider defendant's ability to pay and is sufficient to allow for adequate appellate review, the sentencing court was not required to make specific findings or delineate its reasons for imposing the fine it did.   See Savoie, 985 F.2d at 620;  United  States v. Wilfred American Educ. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575826\"><a href=\"/opinion/575826/united-states-v-wilfred-american-educational-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 719-20 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, given that we find no error in the imposition of the fine upon appellant, we reject his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel insofar as that claim is predicated on counsel's alleged errors in failing to object to the fine.  To the extent appellant's claim is predicated on counsel's alleged conflict of interest, we affirm its dismissal essentially for the reasons stated by the district court in its opinion and order dated August 2, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The applicable provision of the current guideline is to the same effect.
