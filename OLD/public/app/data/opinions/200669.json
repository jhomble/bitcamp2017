Challenging certain decisions of\n\nthe police chief and the conduct of a fellow officer, a discharged\n\npolice     officer     sought     relief        in   federal     court      under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Massachusetts law. The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for the defendants on the merits of all claims\n\nexcept one for assault and battery, over which it declined to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction.             See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).      The\n\ndischarged officer now appeals.           Having viewed      the evidence and\n\nall reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\n\ndischarged officer, we conclude that summary judgment was properly\n\nentered.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            Plaintiff-appellant Joel Rosenfeld was suspended from the\n\nMillis, Massachusetts, Police Department on May 3, 1998.                 On that\n\ndate, Rosenfeld was also required to surrender both his service\n\nfirearm and his firearms license.             Defendant-appellee Police Chief\n\nAlbert Baima ordered these actions pending an investigation of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding an April 30th station-house altercation\n\nbetween    Rosenfeld    and     fellow    officer    David     Egy,   the   other\n\ndefendant-appellee.      For his own part in the altercation, Egy was\n\nplaced on administrative leave and ordered to surrender both his\n\nservice firearm and firearms license.\n\n            Although Egy eventually was reinstated to the active\n\nroster, Rosenfeld was not. Nor did Rosenfeld's troubles end there.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fOn October 13, 1998, Baima denied Rosenfeld's license-to-carry\n\nrenewal application,1 which Rosenfeld had submitted (along with\n\nseveral letters of recommendation) following the expiration of his\n\nconfiscated license.\n\n           Rosenfeld also was experiencing problems at home.               In\n\nDecember 1998, Rosenfeld's wife, Charlotte, filed for divorce.\n\nBased on an affidavit filed with the probate court, Charlotte soon\n\nthereafter      obtained    an    ex   parte    restraining   order   against\n\nRosenfeld.2     Subsequently, a hearing was held to determine whether\n\nthe ex parte order should be continued in effect.             Rosenfeld, Egy,\n\nand Baima were present at this hearing, during which Egy submitted\n\nto the probate judge a written police report detailing Rosenfeld's\n\nalleged failure to comply with the initial order.                  The court\n\nultimately continued Charlotte's restraining order.\n\n           Although the above events are undisputed, their causes\n\nare hotly contested.       Specifically, the parties dispute the actual\n\nmotivations behind Charlotte's procurement of the restraining order\n\nand   Baima's    decision    to    deny   the   renewal   application.     An\n\n\n\n      1\n      Massachusetts law invests firearms-licensing authority in the\nchief of police. See Howard v. Chief of Police of Wakefield, 794\nN.E.2d 604, 606 (Mass. App. Ct. 2003) (\"[A] chief of police may\nissue a carrying license 'if it appears that the applicant is a\nsuitable person to be issued such license' and has an acceptable\nreason for requesting such a license.\") (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws\nch. 140, § 131(d)).\n      2\n      Charlotte's Affidavit of Irreparable Harm alleged, inter\nalia, that she twice had been raped by Rosenfeld.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fappreciation of the parties' competing versions requires some\n\nbacktracking.\n\n          In 1986, Officer Rosenfeld had sued Chief Baima for\n\ntrespassing    on    his    property.     Apparently,   Baima    had   entered\n\nRosenfeld's home to ensure that Rosenfeld, who had called in sick\n\nto work that day, was genuinely sick.         In 1987, the Millis Board of\n\nSelectmen held seemingly unrelated hearings to determine whether\n\nBaima should be removed as police chief.3         Although Rosenfeld, Egy,\n\nand several other police officers testified against Baima at the\n\nhearings, the Board took no adverse action.             Rosenfeld believes\n\nthat Baima has held a grudge against him ever since.\n\n          Despite any grudge that may have existed, Baima and\n\nRosenfeld enjoyed a \"professional\" working relationship during the\n\nten years that followed the 1987 hearings.            But in 1997, a series\n\nof events caused the relationship to sour. The problems began when\n\nCharlotte Rosenfeld informed Officer Egy that her husband had been\n\nabusing her.        Egy thereafter began calling the Rosenfeld home\n\nthree-to-four       times   per   day,    allegedly   out   of   concern   for\n\nCharlotte's safety.         Rosenfeld contends, however, that he never\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Baima testified during his deposition that these hearings\nwere motivated by political differences, including a running\ndispute between himself and the Board of Selectmen over who should\ncontrol certain functions within the Millis Police Department.\nRosenfeld contends that Baima also believed that Rosenfeld's mother\nhad some responsibility for instigating the hearings.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fabused Charlotte and that, in fact, Egy and Charlotte were involved\n\nin an extramarital affair.\n\n            Disgusted      with      the     \"constant        interaction     between\n\nCharlotte    and    Egy   under      the    guise    of     friendship,\"    Rosenfeld\n\ninitiated the April 30, 1998 altercation. Upon encountering Egy at\n\nthe station house, Rosenfeld demanded that Egy stay away from\n\nCharlotte. Egy refused, stating that he knew all about Rosenfeld's\n\nspousal abuse.        To prove his point, Egy produced a photograph\n\ndepicting Charlotte with a black eye.                     At some point, Egy also\n\nstruck Rosenfeld in the chest.\n\n            The following day, Rosenfeld notified Chief Baima of\n\nEgy's assault.       When asked to explain his actions, Egy informed\n\nBaima that Rosenfeld had been abusing Charlotte. Thereafter, Baima\n\nturned the investigation over to the district attorney, removed\n\nRosenfeld from the active duty roster, and ordered Rosenfeld to\n\nsurrender his service firearm and firearms license.\n\n            These    decisions,       together       with    Egy's   assault,   Egy's\n\ninvolvement in the subsequent restraining-order proceedings, and\n\nBaima's     eventual      denial       of    Rosenfeld's         firearms     renewal\n\napplication,       were   the   primary      bases    for     Rosenfeld's    lawsuit.\n\nRosenfeld's somewhat-rambling complaint contained fourteen separate\n\ncounts, collectively alleging violations of the First, Fourth, and\n\nFourteenth    Amendments,       as    well    as    several     constitutional    and\n\ncommon-law torts under Massachusetts law.\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f           Following discovery, Egy and Baima moved for summary\n\njudgment on all of Rosenfeld's claims.                As noted earlier, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment on all counts except an\n\nassault-and-battery count, which it dismissed without prejudice\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).        See Rosenfeld v. Egy, No. Civ. A. 01-\n\n10730-DPW, 2003 WL 222119 (D. Mass. Jan. 29, 2003) (memorandum and\n\norder on motion for summary judgment).             The court reasoned, inter\n\nalia, that (1) Baima was entitled to qualified immunity on claims\n\narising   out    of    his   denial   of    Rosenfeld's     firearms    renewal\n\napplication, and (2) the Rooker-Feldman doctrine barred certain\n\nclaims against Egy.\n\n           This appeal followed.\n\n                                      II.\n\n           We review summary judgment decisions de novo, after\n\nviewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light\n\nmost favorable to the non-moving party.                Rosenberg v. City of\n\nEverett, 328 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).                 Summary judgment is\n\nproper    when        \"the   pleadings,          depositions,    answers      to\n\ninterrogatories,       and   admissions     on    file,   together     with   the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.\"       Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n           Rosenfeld raises several arguments on appeal challenging\n\nthe district court's entry of summary judgment.             Having considered\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fall such arguments, we agree with the district court that summary\n\njudgment was proper on all counts except the assault-and-battery\n\ncount.   Because we are convinced by the court's thorough reasoning\n\nwith respect to most of Rosenfeld's claims, we affirm its entry of\n\njudgment on those claims without further elaboration. In our view,\n\nonly   two   issues       warrant    further    discussion:    (1)   whether      the\n\ndistrict court properly granted summary judgment for Baima on\n\nRosenfeld's       claim    that     the   denial   of    his   firearms       renewal\n\napplication       deprived    him    of   his   rights   under   the    First     and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and (2)\n\nwhether the district court properly granted Egy summary judgment on\n\nRosenfeld's constitutional claim against him.                  We discuss these\n\nissues in turn.\n\n             A.    The Denial of the Renewal Application\n\n             We first consider Rosenfeld's claim that Baima's \"refusal\n\nto renew [Rosenfeld's] license to carry ...[,] after receiving no\n\ncorroborating evidence of Rosenfeld's alleged domestic abuse[,] was\n\nnothing more than retaliatory discipline originating from Baima's\n\ndiscriminatory        animus.\"            Rosenfeld      contends      that     this\n\n\"discriminatory animus,\" allegedly rooted in hard feelings about\n\nRosenfeld's 1986 trespass suit and 1987 testimony before the Millis\n\nBoard of Selectmen, caused Baima to deny the renewal application in\n\nviolation of Rosenfeld's rights under the First and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f            In granting summary judgment for Baima on this claim, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that Baima was entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nSee Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982) (\"[G]overnment\n\nofficials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded\n\nfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\n\nviolate 'clearly established' statutory or constitutional rights of\n\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.\").                   The able district\n\ncourt judge may well have decided this question correctly, but we\n\nneed not and do not reach it; Rosenfeld's claim fails because no\n\nreasonable jury could find either a First or Fourteenth Amendment\n\nviolation on the facts that Rosenfeld has adduced.                  Cf. Saucier v.\n\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001) (\"A court required to rule upon the\n\nqualified   immunity         issue    must   consider,    then,    this   threshold\n\nquestion: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting\n\nthe injury,       do   the    facts    alleged   show    the     officer's    conduct\n\nviolated    a    constitutional        right?     This    must     be   the   initial\n\ninquiry.\"       (citation omitted)).\n\n            Before turning to the First Amendment claim, we dispose\n\nof   Rosenfeld's        Fourteenth       Amendment       equal     protection     and\n\nsubstantive due process claims, which do not require extensive\n\nanalysis.       As to equal protection, Rosenfeld has not presented\n\nsufficient evidence to show that he was treated differently than\n\nsimilarly situated individuals. Moreover, this claim substantially\n\noverlaps with his stronger First Amendment claim addressed below.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fSee Nestor Colon Medina & Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32,\n\n44-45 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"There is an obvious danger to opening up\n\nlocal permitting decisions to detailed federal judicial scrutiny\n\nunder equal protection rubric.        If disgruntled permit applicants\n\ncould create constitutional claims merely by alleging that they\n\nwere treated differently from a similarly situated applicant, the\n\ncorrectness of virtually any state permit denial would become\n\nsubject to litigation in federal court. . . . Given the overlap of\n\n[plaintiff's First Amendment and equal protection claims], and the\n\nvast problems that would be created, we see little basis or\n\njustification for applying equal protection analysis in the present\n\nsituation.\").\n\n           Regarding substantive due process, Rosenfeld has neither\n\ndemonstrated a trialworthy issue as to whether Baima's decision\n\n\"shocks the conscience\" nor identified a protected property or\n\nliberty interest infringed by the non-renewal of his license.            See\n\nCruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montanez, 212 F.3d 617, 622 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(\"There are two theories under which a plaintiff may bring a\n\nsubstantive due process claim.        Under the first, a plaintiff must\n\ndemonstrate a deprivation of an identified liberty or property\n\ninterest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.         Under the second,\n\na plaintiff is not required to prove the deprivation . . ., but,\n\nrather,   he   must   prove   that   the   state's   conduct   'shocks   the\n\nconscience.'\" (citation omitted)); Howard, 794 N.E.2d at 607 (\"The\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fDeclaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution provides\n\nthe private citizen no right to keep and bear arms, and thus there\n\nis no question of a property right or deprivation of liberty\n\ninvolved in the statutory procedures for obtaining a license to\n\ncarry firearms.\" (citations and internal quotation omitted)).\n\n            To prevail on his First Amendment retaliation claim,\n\nRosenfeld must show that his constitutionally protected conduct --\n\nhis 1986 lawsuit and 1987 testimony -- was a \"substantial factor\"\n\nbehind Baima's decision to deny the renewal application.              See\n\nCollins v. Nuzzo, 244 F.3d 246, 251-52 (1st Cir. 2001).               If\n\nRosenfeld meets this threshold burden, the burden shifts to Baima\n\nto prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he would have\n\nreached the same decision even in the absence of Rosenfeld's 1986\n\nlawsuit and 1987 testimony.      See id.; see also Mt. Healthy City\n\nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).\n\n            Rosenfeld attempts to satisfy his threshold burden by\n\ncalling our attention to a few random comments allegedly made by\n\nBaima during the ten years that followed the 1987 hearings.        We are\n\npresented   with   the   deposition   testimony   of   three   department\n\nofficers, all of whom testified that, at one time or another, Baima\n\nexpressed to them his displeasure with the events surrounding the\n\n1987   hearings.    Relevant   portions   of   these   depositions   are\n\nreproduced below.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fDeposition of Officer Dixon\n\nQ: Now, you testified previously that Mr.\nBaima had said at one point in time in the\nlocker room that he was going to get the\npeople involved in the hearings, do you recall\nthat testimony?\nA: Yes.\nQ: When was it that he said that?\nA: That wasn't all that long ago.      He had\nalways expressed that up until a short time\nbefore he stopped being chief [in June 1999].\nQ: How many times did you hear him say, I am\ngoing to get everybody involved in that?\n...\nA: Three, four times.\nQ: Would it be fair to say the time in the\nlocker room was ten years after the hearings\nhad taken place?\nA: Basically.\n\n\n\nDeposition of Officer MacLeod\n\nQ: Are you aware of any conversation in which\n   Baima stated that it was his intent to\n   retaliate against individuals that had\n   previously provided testimony against him\n   before the board of selectmen?\nA: That isn't the wording he used, but the\n   substance.\nQ: Well, tell me about the wording he used.\nA: We were going to [a seminar].... On the\n   way over he was talking about the new board\n   of selectmen, he said, \"They're just as bad\n   as the last; they're after me....      I am\n   going to get everybody that tried to screw\n   me during those years.\"\n\n\n\n                    -11-\n\f              Deposition of Officer Quinn\n\n              Q: What conduct or statements did Baima make\n                 that you are aware of which led you to\n                 conclude or believe that [Baima] did not\n                 like [Rosenfeld]?\n              A: He had made a comment one time about the\n                 fact that Joel had sued him and that he'd\n                 never forget it.\n              Q: Any other comments?\n              A: Not that I recall exactly anything.    He\n                 made comments in passing sometimes, but I\n                 don't recall any comments that were\n                 directed against [Rosenfeld].\n\n              \"While ambiguous remarks may, under some circumstances,\n\nhelp to illuminate the summary judgment record, such remarks rarely\n\nwill suffice to conceive an issue of material fact when none\n\notherwise exists.\" National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43\n\nF.3d 731, 743-44 (1st Cir. 1995).           Baima's statements, even if\n\nviewed in the most cynical light, are at best ambiguous references\n\nto a decade-old grudge held against a number of individuals.           In\n\nfact,   the    only   testimony   concerning   Rosenfeld   himself,   that\n\nprovided by Officer Quinn, speaks in terms of an unpleasant memory\n\nand not in terms of revenge.       As the district court properly noted\n\nin its discussion of a parallel claim, evidence of a free-floating\n\ndesire to get even is simply not enough to establish the requisite\n\n\"substantial factor.\"       Were it otherwise, the threshold hurdle\n\nrequired by the Constitution would amount to little more than a\n\nstepping stone.\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f           Additionally,      Rosenfeld's     1987   testimony    is       too   far\n\nremoved in time from Baima's 1998 decision to ground a reasonable\n\ninference of retaliation.            As we frequently have observed in\n\nantidiscrimination cases, \"the inference of a causal connection\n\nbecomes tenuous with the passage of time.\" Dressler v. Daniel, 315\n\nF.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2003) (affirming summary judgment upon\n\nfinding   that    no    reasonable    factfinder     could   find      a    causal\n\nconnection between the protected conduct and an adverse action\n\ntaken two years later); see also Lewis v. Gillette Co., 22 F.3d 22,\n\n25 (1st Cir. 1994) (granting summary judgment where more than two\n\nyears had elapsed between the protected conduct and the alleged\n\nretaliation); Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 828 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (holding that a nine-month period between the protected\n\nconduct   and    alleged   retaliation       undermined   the    inference       of\n\ncausation).\n\n           We have previously stated:\n\n           [A] court pondering a [summary judgment]\n           motion need not embrace inferences that are\n           wildly improbable or that rely on 'tenuous\n           insinuation.' . . . [E]ven in cases where\n           elusive concepts such as motive or intent are\n           at issue, summary judgment may be appropriate\n           if the nonmoving party rests merely upon\n           conclusory allegations, improbable inferences,\n           and unsupported speculation.\n\nNational Amusements, Inc., 43 F.3d at 743-44 (citations omitted and\n\nemphasis added).       Given the tenuous nature of Rosenfeld's evidence\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fand the stronger competing evidence on which we next focus, we\n\nbelieve that the inferences Rosenfeld invites us to draw are\n\nimprobable.\n\n          Even       assuming      arguendo      that    Baima's    comments   are\n\nunambiguous and that the 1986 lawsuit and 1987 testimony are close\n\nenough in time to the 1998 license denial to establish a reasonable\n\ninference of retaliatory motive, such an inference is considerably\n\nweakened by other facts in the record.                   See Lewis v. City of\n\nBoston, 321 F.3d 207, 220 (1st Cir. 2003) (finding that, in this\n\nparticular     case,       \"the    inference      carried    by     the   temporal\n\nproximity . . . dissipates when consideration is given to the\n\nattendant circumstances\" (emphasis added)).                  Not only does the\n\nrecord contain evidence disputing the assertion that Baima held a\n\ngrudge against Rosenfeld, it also contains strong evidence that\n\nBaima's non-renewal of Rosenfeld's license would have occurred\n\nirrespective of their history.\n\n          First,       the       evidence   portrays      the      Rosenfeld-Baima\n\nrelationship    in     a   way    that   calls    into    question     Rosenfeld's\n\ndescription of Baima as a person he perceived to be a grudge-\n\nholding, revenge seeker.             For example, during his deposition,\n\nRosenfeld testified that Baima had been an invited guest at his\n\nwedding and that Baima \"might have\" attended not only the wedding\n\nbut also other family functions such as a bar mitzvah and a post-\n\nfuneral reception in the Rosenfeld home.                Both men testified that\n\n                                         -14-\n\fthey enjoyed a professional relationship with the other, and\n\nRosenfeld acknowledged that Baima had displayed no animosity toward\n\nhim during the ten years following the 1987 hearings.                 Officer\n\nDixon, one of the three officers who testified concerning comments\n\nallegedly    made   by    Baima,   also    testified    that   it    was     his\n\nunderstanding that Chief Baima was a friend to Rosenfeld.                  While\n\nsuch evidence is not dispositive, it serves to weaken further an\n\ninference that already is too speculative.\n\n            Second, and more importantly, Baima had a compelling\n\nreason for denying Rosenfeld's renewal application: substantiated\n\nallegations of spousal abuse.        Specifically, Baima had before him\n\na photograph depicting Charlotte with a bruised face, a report from\n\nEgy detailing Charlotte's accusations, and a report from a third\n\nofficer, Officer MacLeod, stating that he had \"seen first-hand\n\nexamples of [Rosenfeld's] physical violence towards [Charlotte] and\n\n[had]   heard   talk     through   members   of   the   Norfolk     Hunt    Club\n\n[regarding] this.\"        This considerable evidence of spousal abuse\n\navailable to Baima at the time of his decision strongly suggests\n\nthat Baima denied the renewal application because Rosenfeld failed\n\nto satisfy the \"suitable person\" standard used in Massachusetts to\n\ngovern the issuance of firearm permits.           See Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n140, § 131(d); see also Howard, 794 N.E.2d at 606 (noting that the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f\"suitable person\" standard \"vests in the chief broad discretion or\n\n'considerable latitude'\").4\n\n          In summary, there was insufficient evidence to establish\n\na trialworthy issue on Rosenfeld's retaliation claim.         On the\n\nrecord as a whole, the isolated comments to which Rosenfeld points\n\nare insufficient to ground a finding that Baima's non-renewal of\n\nRosenfeld's license was grounded in retaliation and would not have\n\noccurred absent the parties' tangled history.         No reasonable\n\nfactfinder could conclude that Baima's conduct deprived Rosenfeld\n\nof his First Amendment rights.\n\n          B.   The Federal Constitutional Claim Against Egy\n\n          In   his   complaint,    Rosenfeld   contended   that   his\n\nconstitutional rights were violated as a result of Egy's improper\n\ninvolvement in both the issuance and continuance of Charlotte's\n\nrestraining order.   As we understand it, Rosenfeld's position is\n\n\n\n     4\n      Whether or not Baima acted within the state-law bounds of\ndiscretion is, of course, a different question.       For example,\nRosenfeld contends that Baima should have given more weight to the\ndistrict attorney's letter, which stated that the prosecution could\nnot go forward due to Charlotte's failure to cooperate. Rosenfeld\nalso alleges that the photograph of Charlotte was \"doctored\" by\nEgy. If Rosenfeld wants to argue that he is, in fact, a \"suitable\nperson,\" his proper recourse is with the state courts. See Mass.\nGen. Laws ch. 140, § 131(f) (\"Any applicant or holder aggrieved by\na denial, revocation or suspension of a license . . . [may] file a\npetition to obtain judicial review in the district court having\njurisdiction in the city or town wherein the applicant filed for,\nor was issued, such license.\"). At oral argument, we were advised\nthat an appeal on these matters was still pending before the\nWrentham District Court.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fthat a viable § 1983 claim exists because Egy \"redirected the\n\nProbate Court's attention away from the truth and [deprived]\n\nRosenfeld [of] the opportunity to address Charlotte's fabricated\n\nallegations which would have cleared his name and terminated the\n\nrestraining   order   which   seized   his   liberty.\"   For   support,\n\nRosenfeld argues that Egy both coerced Charlotte into obtaining the\n\nex parte restraining order and presented to the probate court at\n\nthe continuance hearing a false report, which called into question\n\nRosenfeld's compliance with the ex parte order.      Neither issue was\n\nraised before the probate court.\n\n          Without reaching the merits of this amorphous claim,5 the\n\ndistrict court entered summary judgment for Egy on the threshold\n\nground that the claim was barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.\n\nSee Mandel v. Town of Orleans, 326 F.3d 267, 271 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(noting that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is \"at least quasi-\n\njurisdictional\") (citing Picard v. Members of the Employee Ret. Bd.\n\nof Providence, 275 F.3d 139, 145 (1st Cir. 2001)); see also\n\nRooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923); D.C. Ct. of\n\nApp. v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983).         In the court's view, an\n\nassessment of the merits of Rosenfeld's claim would effectively\n\nrequire it to review judgments made by the probate court in\n\nissuing, and then continuing, the restraining order.           Rosenfeld\n\n\n\n     5\n      The district court assumed, as do we, that Rosenfeld is\nalleging a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fargues that the doctrine does not apply because he is not here\n\nattacking the restraining order per se.               He is wrong.\n\n             We have described the contours of the Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine as follows:\n\n            The Rooker-Feldman doctrine prohibits federal\n            district and circuit courts from reviewing\n            state court judgments. Where a party did not\n            actually present its federal claims in state\n            court, Rooker-Feldman forecloses lower federal\n            court jurisdiction over claims that are\n            inextricably intertwined with the claims\n            adjudicated in    a state court.    A federal\n            claim is inextricably intertwined with the\n            state-court claims if the federal claim\n            succeeds only to the extent that the state\n            court wrongly decided the issues before it.\n\nSheehan v. Marr, 207 F.3d 35, 39-40 (1st Cir. 2000) (citations and\n\nquotation    marks    omitted);     see    also   Mandel,      326   F.3d   at   271\n\n(\"Although    res    judicata   doctrine      would    often    achieve     similar\n\neffects, Rooker-Feldman . . . is widely used by the federal court\n\nto prevent end-runs around state judgments.\"); Wilson v. Shumway,\n\n264 F.3d 120, 126 (1st Cir. 2001) (observing that 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nis not to be used as a vehicle for avoiding application of the\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine).\n\n            Rosenfeld's      alleged       constitutional       injury      --   the\n\nrestraining order that \"seized his liberty\" -- could only exist to\n\nthe extent that the probate court wrongly decided to issue, and\n\nlater continue, the restraining order. In other words, Rosenfeld's\n\nliberty   never      would   have   been    \"seized\"     --    and   his    dubious\n\n                                       -18-\n\fconstitutional   claim    never   raised   --    had   the    probate   court\n\ndetermined   that   a    restraining     order   was    not    warranted.\n\nRosenfeld's claim against Egy is, then, essentially a challenge to\n\nthe reliability of the evidence supporting the continuance of the\n\nrestraining order –- an issue that is \"inextricably intertwined\"\n\nwith the claims adjudicated in state court.            The Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine prevents us from addressing it.\n\n                                  III.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f",

The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the merits of all claims except one for assault and battery, over which it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c). The discharged officer now appeals. Having viewed the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the discharged officer, we conclude that summary judgment was properly entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Joel Rosenfeld was suspended from the Millis, Massachusetts, Police Department on May 3, 1998. On that date, Rosenfeld was also required to surrender both his service firearm and his firearms license. Defendant-appellee Police Chief Albert Baima ordered these actions pending an investigation of the circumstances surrounding an April 30th station-house altercation between Rosenfeld and fellow officer David Egy, the other defendant-appellee. For his own part in the altercation, Egy was placed on administrative leave and ordered to surrender both his service firearm and firearms license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Egy eventually was reinstated to the active roster, Rosenfeld was not. Nor did Rosenfeld's troubles end there. On October 13, 1998, Baima denied Rosenfeld's license-to-carry renewal application,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> which Rosenfeld had submitted (along with several letters of recommendation) following the expiration of his confiscated license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosenfeld also was experiencing problems at home. In December 1998, Rosenfeld's wife, Charlotte, filed for divorce. Based on an affidavit filed with the probate court, Charlotte soon thereafter obtained an <i>ex parte</i> restraining order against Rosenfeld.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Subsequently, a hearing was held to determine whether the <i>ex parte</i> order should be continued in effect. Rosenfeld, Egy, and Baima were present at this hearing, during which Egy submitted to the probate judge a written police report detailing Rosenfeld's alleged failure to comply with the initial order. The court ultimately continued Charlotte's restraining order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the above events are undisputed, their causes are hotly contested. Specifically, the parties dispute the actual motivations behind Charlotte's procurement of the restraining order and Baima's decision to deny the renewal application. An appreciation of the parties' competing versions requires some backtracking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, Officer Rosenfeld had sued Chief Baima for trespassing on his property. Apparently, Baima had entered Rosenfeld's home to ensure that Rosenfeld, who had called in sick to work that day, was genuinely sick. In 1987, the Millis Board of Selectmen held seemingly unrelated hearings to determine whether Baima should be removed as police chief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although Rosenfeld, Egy, and several other police officers testified against Baima at the hearings, the Board took no adverse action. Rosenfeld believes that Baima has held a grudge against him ever since.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite any grudge that may have existed, Baima and Rosenfeld enjoyed a \"professional\" working relationship during the ten years that followed the 1987 hearings. But in 1997, a series of events caused the relationship to sour. The problems began when Charlotte Rosenfeld informed Officer Egy that her husband had been abusing her. Egy thereafter began calling the Rosenfeld home three-to-four times per day, allegedly out of concern for Charlotte's safety. Rosenfeld contends, however, that he never abused Charlotte and that, in fact, Egy and Charlotte were involved in an extramarital affair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disgusted with the \"constant interaction between Charlotte and Egy under the guise of friendship,\" Rosenfeld initiated the April 30, 1998 altercation. Upon encountering Egy at the station house, Rosenfeld demanded that Egy stay away from Charlotte. Egy refused, stating that he knew all about Rosenfeld's spousal abuse. To prove his point, Egy produced a photograph depicting Charlotte with a black eye. At some point, Egy also struck Rosenfeld in the chest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, Rosenfeld notified Chief Baima of Egy's assault. When asked to explain his actions, Egy informed Baima that Rosenfeld had been abusing Charlotte. Thereafter, Baima turned the investigation over to the district attorney, removed Rosenfeld from the active duty roster, and ordered Rosenfeld to surrender his service firearm and firearms license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These decisions, together with Egy's assault, Egy's involvement in the subsequent restraining-order proceedings, and Baima's eventual denial of Rosenfeld's firearms renewal application, were the primary bases for Rosenfeld's lawsuit. Rosenfeld's somewhat-rambling complaint contained fourteen separate counts, collectively alleging violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as several constitutional and common-law torts under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following discovery, Egy and Baima moved for summary judgment on all of Rosenfeld's claims. As noted earlier, the district court granted summary judgment on all counts except an assault-and-battery count, which it dismissed without prejudice under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c). <i>See Rosenfeld v. Egy,</i> No. Civ. A. 01-10730-DPW, 2003 WL 222119 (D.Mass. Jan. 29, 2003) (memorandum and order on motion for summary judgment). The court reasoned, <i>inter alia,</i> that (1) Baima was entitled to qualified immunity on claims arising out of his denial of Rosenfeld's firearms renewal application, and (2) the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine barred certain claims against Egy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review summary judgment decisions <i>de novo,</i> after viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <i>Rosenberg v. City of Everett,</i> 328 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2003). Summary judgment is proper when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosenfeld raises several arguments on appeal challenging the district court's entry of summary judgment. Having considered all such arguments, we agree with the district court that summary judgment was proper on all counts except the assault-and-battery count. Because we are convinced by the court's thorough reasoning with respect to most of Rosenfeld's claims, we affirm its entry of judgment on those claims without further elaboration. In our view, only two issues warrant further discussion: (1) whether the district court properly granted summary judgment for Baima on Rosenfeld's claim that the denial of his firearms renewal application deprived him of his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and (2) whether the district court properly granted Egy summary judgment on Rosenfeld's constitutional claim against him. We discuss these issues in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Denial of the Renewal Application</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider Rosenfeld's claim that Baima's \"refusal to renew [Rosenfeld's] license to carry ... [,] after receiving no corroborating evidence of Rosenfeld's alleged domestic abuse[,] was nothing more than retaliatory discipline originating from Baima's discriminatory animus.\" Rosenfeld contends that this \"discriminatory animus,\" allegedly rooted in hard feelings about Rosenfeld's 1986 trespass suit and 1987 testimony before the Millis Board of Selectmen, caused Baima to deny the renewal application in violation of Rosenfeld's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting summary judgment for Baima on this claim, the district court ruled that Baima was entitled to qualified immunity. <i>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (\"[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate `clearly established' statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"). The able district court judge may well have decided this question correctly, but we need not and do not reach it; Rosenfeld's claim fails because no reasonable jury could find either a First or Fourteenth Amendment violation on the facts that Rosenfeld has adduced. <i>Cf. Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (\"A court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider, then, this threshold question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right? This must be the initial inquiry.\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before turning to the First Amendment claim, we dispose of Rosenfeld's Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and substantive due process claims, which do not require extensive analysis. As to equal protection, Rosenfeld has not presented sufficient evidence to show that he was treated differently than similarly situated individuals. Moreover, this claim substantially overlaps with his stronger First Amendment claim addressed below. <i>See Nestor Colon Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio,</i> 964 F.2d 32, 44-45 (1st Cir.1992) (\"There is an obvious danger to opening up local permitting decisions to detailed federal judicial scrutiny under equal protection rubric. If disgruntled permit applicants could create constitutional claims merely by alleging that they were treated differently from a similarly situated applicant, the correctness of virtually any state permit denial would become subject to litigation in federal court.... Given the overlap of [plaintiff's First Amendment and equal protection claims], and the vast problems that would be created, we see little basis or justification for applying equal protection analysis in the present situation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding substantive due process, Rosenfeld has neither demonstrated a trialworthy issue as to whether Baima's decision \"shocks the conscience\" nor identified a protected property or liberty interest infringed by the non-renewal of his license. <i>See Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montanez,</i> 212 F.3d 617, 622 (1st Cir.2000) (\"There are two theories under which a plaintiff may bring a substantive due process claim. Under the first, a plaintiff must demonstrate a deprivation of an identified liberty or property interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Under the second, a plaintiff is not required to prove the deprivation ..., but, rather, he must prove that the state's conduct `shocks the conscience.'\" (citation omitted)); <i>Howard,</i> 794 N.E.2d at 607 (\"The Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution provides the private citizen no right to keep and bear arms, and thus there is no question of a property right or deprivation of liberty involved in the statutory procedures for obtaining a license to carry firearms.\" (citations and internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on his First Amendment retaliation claim, Rosenfeld must show that his constitutionally protected conduct &#8212; his 1986 lawsuit and 1987 testimony &#8212; was a \"substantial factor\" behind Baima's decision to deny the renewal application. <i>See Collins v. Nuzzo,</i> 244 F.3d 246, 251-52 (1st Cir.2001). If Rosenfeld meets this threshold burden, the burden shifts to Baima to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he would have reached the same decision even in the absence of Rosenfeld's 1986 lawsuit and 1987 testimony. <i>See id.; see also Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.

Town of Dedham,</i> 43 F.3d 731, 743-44 (1st Cir. 1995). Baima's statements, even if viewed in the most cynical light, are at best ambiguous references to a decade-old grudge held against a number of individuals. In fact, the only testimony concerning Rosenfeld himself, that provided by Officer Quinn, speaks in terms of an unpleasant memory and not in terms of revenge. As the district court properly noted in its discussion of a parallel claim, evidence of a free-floating desire to get even is simply not enough to establish the requisite \"substantial factor.\" Were it otherwise, the threshold hurdle required by the Constitution would amount to little more than a stepping stone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Rosenfeld's 1987 testimony is too far removed in time from Baima's 1998 decision to ground a reasonable inference of retaliation. As we frequently have observed in antidiscrimination cases, \"the inference of a causal connection becomes tenuous with the passage of time.\" <i>Dressler v. Daniel,</i> 315 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2003) (affirming summary judgment upon finding that no reasonable factfinder could find a causal connection between the protected conduct and an adverse action taken <i>two years</i> later); <i>see also Lewis v. Gillette Co.,</i> 22 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1994) (granting summary judgment where more than <i>two years</i> had elapsed between the protected conduct and the alleged retaliation); <i>Mesnick v. General Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 828 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that a <i>nine-month period</i> between the protected conduct and alleged retaliation undermined the inference of causation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We have previously stated:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A] court pondering a [summary judgment] motion need not embrace inferences that are wildly improbable or that rely on `tenuous insinuation.' ... [E]ven in cases where elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue, summary judgment may be appropriate if the nonmoving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations, <i>improbable inferences,</i> and unsupported speculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>National Amusements, Inc.,</i> 43 F.3d at 743-44 (citations omitted and emphasis added). Given the tenuous nature of Rosenfeld's evidence and the stronger competing evidence on which we next focus, we believe that the inferences Rosenfeld invites us to draw are improbable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Baima's comments are unambiguous and that the 1986 lawsuit and 1987 testimony are close enough in time to the 1998 license denial to establish a reasonable inference of retaliatory motive, such an inference is considerably weakened by other facts in the record. <i>See Lewis v. City of Boston,</i> 321 F.3d 207, 220 (1st Cir.2003) (finding that, in this particular case, \"the inference carried by the temporal proximity ... dissipates when consideration is given to the <i>attendant circumstances</i>\" (emphasis added)). Not only does the record contain evidence disputing the assertion that Baima held a grudge against Rosenfeld, it also contains strong evidence that Baima's non-renewal of Rosenfeld's license would have occurred irrespective of their history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the evidence portrays the Rosenfeld-Baima relationship in a way that calls into question Rosenfeld's description of Baima as a person he perceived to be a grudge-holding, revenge seeker. For example, during his deposition, Rosenfeld testified that Baima had been an invited guest at his wedding and that Baima \"might have\" attended not only the wedding but also other family functions such as a bar mitzvah and a post-funeral reception in the Rosenfeld home. Both men testified that they enjoyed a professional relationship with the other, and Rosenfeld acknowledged that Baima had displayed no animosity toward him during the ten years following the 1987 hearings. Officer Dixon, one of the three officers who testified concerning comments allegedly made by Baima, also testified that it was his understanding that Chief Baima was a friend to Rosenfeld. While such evidence is not dispositive, it serves to weaken further an inference that already is too speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and more importantly, Baima had a compelling reason for denying Rosenfeld's renewal application: substantiated allegations of spousal abuse. Specifically, Baima had before him a photograph depicting Charlotte with a bruised face, a report from Egy detailing Charlotte's accusations, and a report from a third officer, Officer MacLeod, stating that he had \"seen first-hand examples of [Rosenfeld's] physical violence towards [Charlotte] and [had] heard talk through members of the Norfolk Hunt Club [regarding] this.\" This considerable evidence of spousal abuse available to Baima at the time of his decision strongly suggests that Baima denied the renewal application because Rosenfeld failed to satisfy the \"suitable person\" standard used in Massachusetts to govern the issuance of firearm permits. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &#167; 131(d); <i>see also Howard,</i> 794 N.E.2d at 606 (noting that the \"suitable person\" standard \"vests in the chief broad discretion or `considerable latitude'\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, there was insufficient evidence to establish a trialworthy issue on Rosenfeld's retaliation claim. On the record as a whole, the isolated comments to which Rosenfeld points are insufficient to ground a finding that Baima's non-renewal of Rosenfeld's license was grounded in retaliation and would not have occurred absent the parties' tangled history. No reasonable factfinder could conclude that Baima's conduct deprived Rosenfeld of his First Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Federal Constitutional Claim Against Egy</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his complaint, Rosenfeld contended that his constitutional rights were violated as a result of Egy's improper involvement in both the issuance and continuance of Charlotte's restraining order. As we understand it, Rosenfeld's position is that a viable &#167; 1983 claim exists because Egy \"redirected the Probate Court's attention away from the truth and [deprived] Rosenfeld [of] the opportunity to address Charlotte's fabricated allegations which would have cleared his name and terminated the restraining order which seized his liberty.\" For support, Rosenfeld argues that Egy both coerced Charlotte into obtaining the <i>ex parte</i> restraining order and presented to the probate court at the continuance hearing a false report, which called into question Rosenfeld's compliance with the <i>ex parte</i> order. Neither issue was raised before the probate court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without reaching the merits of this amorphous claim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the district court entered summary judgment for Egy on the threshold ground that the claim was barred by the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine. <i>See Mandel v. Town of Orleans,</i> 326 F.3d 267, 271 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine is \"at least quasi-jurisdictional\") (citing <i>Picard v. Members of the Employee Ret. Bd. of Providence,</i> 275 F.3d 139, 145 (1st Cir.2001)); <i>see also Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co.,</i> 263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <i>D.C. Ct. of App. v. Feldman,</i> 460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). In the court's view, an assessment of the merits of Rosenfeld's claim would effectively require it to review judgments made by the probate court in issuing, and then continuing, the restraining order. Rosenfeld argues that the doctrine does not apply because he is not here attacking the restraining order <i>per se.</i> He is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have described the contours of the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine prohibits federal district and circuit courts from reviewing state court judgments. Where a party did not actually present its federal claims in state court, <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> forecloses lower federal court jurisdiction over claims that are inextricably intertwined with the claims adjudicated in a state court. A federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the state-court claims if the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sheehan v. Marr,</i> 207 F.3d 35, 39-40 (1st Cir.2000) (citations and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Mandel,</i> 326 F.3d at 271 (\"Although res judicata doctrine would often achieve similar effects, <i>Rooker-Feldman</i>... is widely used by the federal court to prevent end-runs around state judgments.\"); <i>Wilson v. Shumway,</i> 264 F.3d 120, 126 (1st Cir.2001) (observing that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 is not to be used as a vehicle for avoiding application of the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosenfeld's alleged constitutional injury &#8212; the restraining order that \"seized his liberty\" &#8212; could only exist to the extent that the probate court wrongly decided to issue, and later continue, the restraining order. In other words, Rosenfeld's liberty never would have been \"seized\" &#8212; and his dubious constitutional claim never raised &#8212; had the probate court determined that a restraining order was not warranted. Rosenfeld's claim against Egy is, then, essentially a challenge to the reliability of the evidence supporting the continuance of the restraining order &#8212; an issue that is \"inextricably intertwined\" with the claims adjudicated in state court. The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine prevents us from addressing it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Massachusetts law invests firearms-licensing authority in the chief of police<i>See Howard v.

On that date, Rosenfeld was also required to surrender both his service firearm and his firearms license. Defendant-appellee Police Chief Albert Baima ordered these actions pending an investigation of the circumstances surrounding an April 30th station-house altercation between Rosenfeld and fellow officer David Egy, the other defendant-appellee. For his own part in the altercation, Egy was placed on administrative leave and ordered to surrender both his service firearm and firearms license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Egy eventually was reinstated to the active roster, Rosenfeld was not. Nor did Rosenfeld's troubles end there. On October 13, 1998, Baima denied Rosenfeld's license-to-carry renewal application,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> which Rosenfeld had submitted (along with several letters of recommendation) following the expiration of his confiscated license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosenfeld also was experiencing problems at home. In December 1998, Rosenfeld's wife, Charlotte, filed for divorce. Based on an affidavit filed with the probate court, Charlotte soon thereafter obtained an <i>ex parte</i> restraining order against Rosenfeld.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Subsequently, a hearing was held to determine whether the <i>ex parte</i> order should be continued in effect. Rosenfeld, Egy, and Baima were present at this hearing, during which Egy submitted to the probate judge a written police report detailing Rosenfeld's alleged failure to comply with the initial order. The court ultimately continued Charlotte's restraining order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the above events are undisputed, their causes are hotly contested. Specifically, the parties dispute the actual motivations behind Charlotte's procurement of the restraining order and Baima's decision to deny the renewal application. An appreciation of the parties' competing versions requires some backtracking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, Officer Rosenfeld had sued Chief Baima for trespassing on his property. Apparently, Baima had entered Rosenfeld's home to ensure that Rosenfeld, who had called in sick to work that day, was genuinely sick. In 1987, the Millis Board of Selectmen held seemingly unrelated hearings to determine whether Baima should be removed as police chief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although Rosenfeld, Egy, and several other police officers testified against Baima at the hearings, the Board took no adverse action. Rosenfeld believes that Baima has held a grudge against him ever since.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite any grudge that may have existed, Baima and Rosenfeld enjoyed a \"professional\" working relationship during the ten years that followed the 1987 hearings. But in 1997, a series of events caused the relationship to sour. The problems began when Charlotte Rosenfeld informed Officer Egy that her husband had been abusing her. Egy thereafter began calling the Rosenfeld home three-to-four times per day, allegedly out of concern for Charlotte's safety. Rosenfeld contends, however, that he never abused Charlotte and that, in fact, Egy and Charlotte were involved in an extramarital affair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disgusted with the \"constant interaction between Charlotte and Egy under the guise of friendship,\" Rosenfeld initiated the April 30, 1998 altercation. Upon encountering Egy at the station house, Rosenfeld demanded that Egy stay away from Charlotte. Egy refused, stating that he knew all about Rosenfeld's spousal abuse. To prove his point, Egy produced a photograph depicting Charlotte with a black eye. At some point, Egy also struck Rosenfeld in the chest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, Rosenfeld notified Chief Baima of Egy's assault. When asked to explain his actions, Egy informed Baima that Rosenfeld had been abusing Charlotte. Thereafter, Baima turned the investigation over to the district attorney, removed Rosenfeld from the active duty roster, and ordered Rosenfeld to surrender his service firearm and firearms license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These decisions, together with Egy's assault, Egy's involvement in the subsequent restraining-order proceedings, and Baima's eventual denial of Rosenfeld's firearms renewal application, were the primary bases for Rosenfeld's lawsuit.

Having considered all such arguments, we agree with the district court that summary judgment was proper on all counts except the assault-and-battery count. Because we are convinced by the court's thorough reasoning with respect to most of Rosenfeld's claims, we affirm its entry of judgment on those claims without further elaboration. In our view, only two issues warrant further discussion: (1) whether the district court properly granted summary judgment for Baima on Rosenfeld's claim that the denial of his firearms renewal application deprived him of his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and (2) whether the district court properly granted Egy summary judgment on Rosenfeld's constitutional claim against him. We discuss these issues in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Denial of the Renewal Application</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider Rosenfeld's claim that Baima's \"refusal to renew [Rosenfeld's] license to carry ... [,] after receiving no corroborating evidence of Rosenfeld's alleged domestic abuse[,] was nothing more than retaliatory discipline originating from Baima's discriminatory animus.\" Rosenfeld contends that this \"discriminatory animus,\" allegedly rooted in hard feelings about Rosenfeld's 1986 trespass suit and 1987 testimony before the Millis Board of Selectmen, caused Baima to deny the renewal application in violation of Rosenfeld's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting summary judgment for Baima on this claim, the district court ruled that Baima was entitled to qualified immunity. <i>See Harlow v.

The able district court judge may well have decided this question correctly, but we need not and do not reach it; Rosenfeld's claim fails because no reasonable jury could find either a First or Fourteenth Amendment violation on the facts that Rosenfeld has adduced. <i>Cf.

As to equal protection, Rosenfeld has not presented sufficient evidence to show that he was treated differently than similarly situated individuals. Moreover, this claim substantially overlaps with his stronger First Amendment claim addressed below. <i>See Nestor Colon Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583574\"><a href=\"/opinion/583574/nestor-colon-medina-sucesores-inc-v-patria-g-custodio/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 44-45 (1st Cir.1992) (\"There is an obvious danger to opening up local permitting decisions to detailed federal judicial scrutiny under equal protection rubric.

Given the overlap of [plaintiff's First Amendment and equal protection claims], and the vast problems that would be created, we see little basis or justification for applying equal protection analysis in the present situation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding substantive due process, Rosenfeld has neither demonstrated a trialworthy issue as to whether Baima's decision \"shocks the conscience\" nor identified a protected property or liberty interest infringed by the non-renewal of his license. <i>See Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montanez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768711\"><a href=\"/opinion/768711/no-99-1675/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, 622 (1st Cir.2000) (\"There are two theories under which a plaintiff may bring a substantive due process claim.

Under the second, a plaintiff is not required to prove the deprivation ..., but, rather, he must prove that the state's conduct `shocks the conscience.'\" (citation omitted)); <i>Howard,</i> 794 N.E.2d at 607 (\"The Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution provides the private citizen no right to keep and bear arms, and thus there is no question of a property right or deprivation of liberty involved in the statutory procedures for obtaining a license to carry firearms.\" (citations and internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on his First Amendment retaliation claim, Rosenfeld must show that his constitutionally protected conduct &#8212; his 1986 lawsuit and 1987 testimony &#8212; was a \"substantial factor\" behind Baima's decision to deny the renewal application. <i>See Collins v.

If Rosenfeld meets this threshold burden, the burden shifts to Baima to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he would have reached the same decision even in the absence of Rosenfeld's 1986 lawsuit and 1987 testimony. <i>See id.; see also Mt.

Baima's statements, even if viewed in the most cynical light, are at best ambiguous references to a decade-old grudge held against a number of individuals. In fact, the only testimony concerning Rosenfeld himself, that provided by Officer Quinn, speaks in terms of an unpleasant memory and not in terms of revenge. As the district court properly noted in its discussion of a parallel claim, evidence of a free-floating desire to get even is simply not enough to establish the requisite \"substantial factor.\" Were it otherwise, the threshold hurdle required by the Constitution would amount to little more than a stepping stone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Rosenfeld's 1987 testimony is too far removed in time from Baima's 1998 decision to ground a reasonable inference of retaliation.

City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200307\"><a href=\"/opinion/200307/lewis-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 220 (1st Cir.2003) (finding that, in this particular case, \"the inference carried by the temporal proximity ... dissipates when consideration is given to the <i>attendant circumstances</i>\" (emphasis added)). Not only does the record contain evidence disputing the assertion that Baima held a grudge against Rosenfeld, it also contains strong evidence that Baima's non-renewal of Rosenfeld's license would have occurred irrespective of their history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the evidence portrays the Rosenfeld-Baima relationship in a way that calls into question Rosenfeld's description of Baima as a person he perceived to be a grudge-holding, revenge seeker. For example, during his deposition, Rosenfeld testified that Baima had been an invited guest at his wedding and that Baima \"might have\" attended not only the wedding but also other family functions such as a bar mitzvah and a post-funeral reception in the Rosenfeld home. Both men testified that they enjoyed a professional relationship with the other, and Rosenfeld acknowledged that Baima had displayed no animosity toward him during the ten years following the 1987 hearings. Officer Dixon, one of the three officers who testified concerning comments allegedly made by Baima, also testified that it was his understanding that Chief Baima was a friend to Rosenfeld. While such evidence is not dispositive, it serves to weaken further an inference that already is too speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and more importantly, Baima had a compelling reason for denying Rosenfeld's renewal application: substantiated allegations of spousal abuse. Specifically, Baima had before him a photograph depicting Charlotte with a bruised face, a report from Egy detailing Charlotte's accusations, and a report from a third officer, Officer MacLeod, stating that he had \"seen first-hand examples of [Rosenfeld's] physical violence towards [Charlotte] and [had] heard talk through members of the Norfolk Hunt Club [regarding] this.\" This considerable evidence of spousal abuse available to Baima at the time of his decision strongly suggests that Baima denied the renewal application because Rosenfeld failed to satisfy the \"suitable person\" standard used in Massachusetts to govern the issuance of firearm permits. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &#167; 131(d); <i>see also Howard,</i> 794 N.E.2d at 606 (noting that the \"suitable person\" standard \"vests in the chief broad discretion or `considerable latitude'\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, there was insufficient evidence to establish a trialworthy issue on Rosenfeld's retaliation claim. On the record as a whole, the isolated comments to which Rosenfeld points are insufficient to ground a finding that Baima's non-renewal of Rosenfeld's license was grounded in retaliation and would not have occurred absent the parties' tangled history. No reasonable factfinder could conclude that Baima's conduct deprived Rosenfeld of his First Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Federal Constitutional Claim Against Egy</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his complaint, Rosenfeld contended that his constitutional rights were violated as a result of Egy's improper involvement in both the issuance and continuance of Charlotte's restraining order. As we understand it, Rosenfeld's position is that a viable &#167; 1983 claim exists because Egy \"redirected the Probate Court's attention away from the truth and [deprived] Rosenfeld [of] the opportunity to address Charlotte's fabricated allegations which would have cleared his name and terminated the restraining order which seized his liberty.\" For support, Rosenfeld argues that Egy both coerced Charlotte into obtaining the <i>ex parte</i> restraining order and presented to the probate court at the continuance hearing a false report, which called into question Rosenfeld's compliance with the <i>ex parte</i> order.

Rosenfeld argues that the doctrine does not apply because he is not here attacking the restraining order <i>per se.</i> He is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have described the contours of the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine prohibits federal district and circuit courts from reviewing state court judgments. Where a party did not actually present its federal claims in state court, <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> forecloses lower federal court jurisdiction over claims that are inextricably intertwined with the claims adjudicated in a state court. A federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the state-court claims if the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sheehan v.

In other words, Rosenfeld's liberty never would have been \"seized\" &#8212; and his dubious constitutional claim never raised &#8212; had the probate court determined that a restraining order was not warranted. Rosenfeld's claim against Egy is, then, essentially a challenge to the reliability of the evidence supporting the continuance of the restraining order &#8212; an issue that is \"inextricably intertwined\" with the claims adjudicated in state court. The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine prevents us from addressing it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Massachusetts law invests firearms-licensing authority in the chief of police<i>See Howard v.

Rosenfeld also alleges that the photograph of Charlotte was \"doctored\" by Egy.
