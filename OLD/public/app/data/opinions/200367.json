Ernest C. Torres, Chief U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n          Torruella, Lynch, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          Robert B. Mann, with whom Mann & Mitchell was on the\nbrief for appellant.\n\n          Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Dulce\nDonovan, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 6, 2003\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.    Ike \"True\" Weems was convicted of\n\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm, a revolver which fired\n\nshotgun shells.      See 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (2000).         He was\n\nsentenced to 282 months of imprisonment.      On appeal, Weems argues\n\nthat the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal and his motion to suppress.        He also appeals various\n\naspects of evidentiary rulings, the jury instructions, and the\n\nsentencing.    We affirm.\n\n            We reject the argument that Jones v. United States, 529\n\nU.S. 848 (2000), overruled prior law and now requires that the\n\ninterstate commerce nexus of § 922(g) be met by proof that it was\n\nthe defendant who transported the weapon beyond state lines.       We\n\nalso reject the argument that the phrase \"not less than fifteen\n\nyears\" for sentences under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n\nsee 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), sets a maximum as well as a minimum\n\nsentence.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            A brief summary of the facts sets the stage. On December\n\n11, 2000, the date Weems was arrested, the police had information\n\nthat he was wanted on two state arrest warrants; that he had been\n\nseen by an informant carrying the firearm at issue here earlier\n\nthat day; that he was suspected of armed robbery; and that he was\n\nbelieved to be dealing drugs from a house at 11 Padelford Street in\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island, where he had been seen regularly.     After\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\freceiving a report from a confidential informant that Weems was at\n\nthe address, the police went quickly to the house without obtaining\n\na separate search warrant.       There, they saw Weems through a window\n\nand entered the house.       Weems hid in the attic but his feet went\n\nthrough the attic floor to the bedroom below, and the police\n\nassisted his delivery into the room by pulling on his legs while he\n\nclung to the rafters.       Weems fell on a bed and there was a tussle.\n\nWithin seconds the police spotted a gun on the bed where Weems had\n\nfallen -- the same unusual gun, a \"Thunder Five\" revolver that\n\ncould fire shotgun shells, with which he had been seen earlier that\n\nday.    He was arrested.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            We start with the appeal from the denial of the motion to\n\nsuppress, because its outcome affects the appeal from the motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal.\n\nA.     The Motion to Suppress\n\n            We describe the facts found by the district court judge,\n\nwhich were established at a two-day evidentiary hearing.\n\n            Weems   moved   to   suppress   the   evidence   seized   at   11\n\nPadelford Street, including the gun.        The basis for the motion was\n\nthat the initial entry into the residence, which was rented by\n\nKatisha Smith, was not justified by the state arrest warrant for\n\nWeems; that the police had used the arrest warrant as a pretext to\n\nenter the house and did not have a search warrant as was needed;\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fand that, in any event, the seized gun should be suppressed because\n\nit   was   not   in   plain   view   and    it   was    found   pursuant   to   an\n\nunauthorized search after a protective sweep had already taken\n\nplace.\n\n            The district court assumed that the entry into the house\n\nwas valid and held it was irrelevant whether the house was Weems's\n\ndwelling or only Smith's dwelling.               The court stated, \"The only\n\nissue here is whether the outstanding arrest warrant was used by\n\nthe agents as a pretext for conducting a warrantless search and\n\nwhether the items seized were the fruits of such a warrantless\n\nsearch\" as opposed to a protective sweep.              The court found that the\n\ngun was in plain view and was lawfully seized pursuant to a\n\nprotective sweep.1       See Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 334-36\n\n(1990).    Indeed, in discussing the seizure of the gun, the court\n\nreferred to concerns for the officer's safety \"because Mr. Weems\n\nhad a lengthy criminal record for violent crimes, armed robbery.\"\n\nThe district court did suppress other evidence taken from the\n\nhouse, which the court found was not seized pursuant either to\n\nWeems's arrest or to a protective sweep.\n\n            When the officers arrived at the address, they knew that\n\nWeems had a lengthy criminal record, that there were two state\n\n\n\n      1\n          \"A 'protective sweep' is a quick and limited search of\npremises, incident to an arrest and conducted to protect the safety\nof police officers or others.\" Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 327\n(1990).\n\n                                      -4-\n\farrest warrants for him, and that Weems had been seen carrying the\n\ngun earlier that day.          One warrant was on a suspended sentence\n\nviolation related to a prior sentence for felony assault with a\n\ndangerous weapon.      They also had information that \"True\" Weems and\n\n\"Understanding\"       Yates   had     conducted    armed   robberies    in    the\n\nProvidence    area;    the    armed    robbers    were   known   as   the    \"Five\n\nPercenter Group.\" In late October, a reliable informant told Agent\n\nEdward Troiano of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\n\nFirearms that Weems had been staying off and on at 11 Padelford\n\nStreet for the past few weeks or months and was dealing drugs from\n\nthat address. In early November the police arrested Yates, but his\n\ncompanions, including Weems, escaped.\n\n             On December 11, an informant told Troiano that Weems was\n\nthen inside the Padelford Street home and that he was armed with\n\nhis shotgun revolver.         Troiano contacted Providence police, and\n\nwent with police officers to the address about half an hour later.\n\nThey did not try to obtain a search warrant for the residence.\n\n             Outside the building, Troiano encountered Smith, who\n\nlived there, and told her they had an arrest warrant for Weems.\n\nShe said that no one lived with her, that no one was in the house,\n\nand that she did not know Weems.              A picture is worth a thousand\n\nwords: while he was talking to Smith out front, other officers saw\n\nWeems stick his head and torso out of a rear window of the house.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fThey called up to Weems but he disappeared inside.   He was told to\n\ncome outside; he did not.\n\n            Troiano testified that, had the officers not seen Weems,\n\nthey would have left.     Because they did see Weems, it became a\n\ndifferent matter.   They told Smith they had seen Weems in the house\n\nand asked for the key.   She declined, but when told the alternative\n\nwas that the police would break down the door, she handed over the\n\nkey.   The police opened the door to the house and yelled that they\n\nwere police and had a warrant for Weems's arrest.       There was no\n\nresponse.\n\n            The officers started a protective sweep of the house,\n\nincluding the two bedrooms; this routinely involves looking to be\n\nsure no one is hiding under beds or behind furniture.   The officers\n\ndid not find Weems, but they noticed a small opening to the attic\n\nin a closet and yelled for Weems to come down.           They heard\n\nfootsteps above and sprayed pepper spray into the attic.     Weems's\n\nfeet broke through the ceiling once and he pulled himself back up\n\ninto the attic; when it happened again the officers pulled him\n\nthrough into the room below.     Understandably, the officers paid\n\nattention to his hands, which were still in the attic.    No officer\n\nsaw Weems hold a gun or saw a gun on his way down.       On the bed,\n\nWeems landed face down and kept his hands underneath himself.     He\n\nwas subdued by the police and made to stand up; as he was being\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\farrested and moved from the room, an officer looked down at the bed\n\nand saw the shotgun revolver on the box spring.\n\n              Weems argues that the entry into the house violated the\n\nFourth Amendment, as did the seizure of the gun.                  If Weems\n\neffectively lived at 11 Padelford, the arrest warrant itself would\n\nbe enough to authorize entry into his residence to effectuate his\n\narrest.    Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 603 (1980); see also\n\nUnited States v. Gay, 240 F.3d 1222, 1226-27 (10th Cir. 2001)\n\n(Payton allows entry because officers had reasonable belief that\n\nsubject of arrest warrant lived at the house they entered).          There\n\nis some evidence to support that view of the facts, but the\n\ndistrict court made no findings on this point, so we bypass it.2\n\n              As this court stated, sitting en banc in Joyce v. Town of\n\nTewksbury, 112 F.3d 19, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc) (per\n\ncuriam), \"even when armed with an arrest warrant, police must\n\ngenerally have a search warrant to enter lawfully a third person's\n\nhome.\"    Accord Fletcher v. Town of Clinton, 196 F.3d 41, 49 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).      In each of these cases, the resident of the house\n\npursued the Fourth Amendment claim.          Our rule is based on Steagald\n\nv.   United    States,   451   U.S.   204   (1981).   Steagald   considered\n\n\"whether, under the Fourth Amendment, a law enforcement officer may\n\n\n\n      2\n          In her testimony at the suppression hearing, Smith was\nexplicit that Weems did not live there and had no authority to\ninvite people in, although he had a key and paid her to rent a\ncloset.\n\n                                      -7-\n\flegally search for the subject of an arrest warrant in the home of\n\na third party without first obtaining a search warrant.\"         Id. at\n\n205.       The Court concluded that \"a search warrant must be obtained\n\nabsent exigent circumstances or consent.\"      Id. at 205-06.3   No one\n\nseriously contends that Smith voluntarily consented, when presented\n\nwith the choice of giving over the keys or having her door broken\n\ndown.       Assuming Weems may raise the Fourth Amendment claim, the\n\nquestion is whether exigent circumstances were present. See Joyce,\n\n112 F.3d at 22.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n           The government argues that the Steagald rule does not\napply when it is the arrestee rather than the resident who raises\nthe Fourth Amendment issue. There is authority from some circuits\nto support the government's view. See United States v. Gorman, 314\nF.3d 1105, 1110-11 (9th Cir. 2002); United States v. Kaylor, 877\nF.2d 658, 663 (8th Cir. 1989); United States v. Buckner, 717 F.2d\n297, 299-300 (6th Cir. 1983).\n           There are also, however, arguments against this narrow\nview of the claim's availability to the arrestee. Steagald itself\nsays that \"most modern commentators agree that a search warrant is\nnecessary to fully protect the privacy interests of third parties\nwhen their home is searched for the subject of an arrest warrant.\"\n421 U.S. at 208 n.3 (citing commentators). The leading treatise\ndescribes analyses that would not apply Steagald to the arrestee's\nclaim as \"bizarre reasoning [which] would render the Steagald rule\na virtual nullity.\" 5 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure, § 11.3(b),\nat 143 (3d ed. 1996). \"If individuals are precluded from objecting\nto warrantless entries and searches of homes by their lack of\nstanding, little incentive remains for law enforcement officers to\ncomply with the warrant rules announced in Payton and Steagald.\"\nJ.D. Harbaugh & N.L. Faust, \"Knock on Any Door\" -- Home Arrests\nAfter Payton and Steagald, 86 Dick. L. Rev. 191 (1982).\n           Here, since we assume that Smith and not Weems is the\nresident, the government's view might bar Weems from raising the\nclaim.    For purposes of this appeal, we will assume without\ndeciding, in Weems's favor, that he may bring the claim.\n\n                                    -8-\n\f          The government argued to the trial court that the initial\n\nentry was justified by exigent circumstances and we agree.    Weems\n\nwas known to be armed with a dangerous weapon and to have a history\n\nof assault; he was seen at the premises and was evidently trying to\n\nescape; he had the opportunity to destroy or hide drugs or the gun,\n\nboth illegal in his hands.   There was a need to act quickly, and\n\nWeems had been given ample opportunity to surrender. See generally\n\nFletcher, 196 F.3d at 49-51 (discussing exigent circumstances).\n\nThe initial entry did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n\n          The focus of Weems's argument to the district court was\n\nthat the arrest warrant was a \"pretext\" used by the Providence\n\npolice to raid a house for which they had no search warrant.    The\n\nentire premise of the attack is misplaced.   The question is not one\n\nof pretext, and the subjective intent of the police plays no role\n\nin the analysis of a motion to suppress under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nSee Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996).   Rather, the\n\nquestion is whether the entry and later activities were objectively\n\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n          The district court was also quite correct to conclude\n\nthat the gun was found in plain view in the course of the arrest,\n\nso we need not reach the other grounds for affirmance offered by\n\nthe government.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fB.   Arguments Based on the First Trial\n\n           The first trial on these charges ended in a mistrial, to\n\nwhich Weems consented.         See United States v. Weems, No. 01-2080\n\n(1st Cir. August 23, 2001) (order).\n\n           Weems attempts to use the first trial in several ways.\n\nHe argues that the court erred in not granting a judgment of\n\nacquittal at the end of the first trial.             Our recent decision in\n\nUnited States v. Julien, 318 F.3d 316, 320-22 (1st Cir. 2003),\n\nforecloses this claim, as Weems's counsel correctly acknowledged at\n\noral argument.\n\n           Weems also argues that the prosecutor may not present a\n\ntheory at the second trial inconsistent with the theory argued at\n\nthe first trial.   We do not see why not.         Weems says his argument\n\nfollows from an emerging doctrine that a prosecutor may not argue\n\ninconsistent theories to a jury.        In support he cites K. Miller,\n\nFeature,   Combating    the     Prosecutor's    Improper    Utilization      of\n\nInconsistent Theories, 26 Champion 16, 18 (June 2002).                 See also\n\nSmith v. Groose, 205 F.3d 1045, 1051-52 (8th Cir. 2000).               We see no\n\nrisk to defendants' rights when two different juries are involved.\n\nIn any event, we think the logic of Julien also forecloses this\n\nattack.\n\n           Finally,    Weems    attempts   to   go   back   to   the    initial\n\ndeclaration of mistrial in order to undo it and raise a double\n\njeopardy argument now. This is another attempt to argue that there\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fis insufficient basis to show that Weems consented to the mistrial.\n\nWe have already disposed of this claim in our order of August 23,\n\n2001, in response to his earlier appeal, which stated, \"the record\n\nin   this   case       makes   clear   that    defendant    consented    to     the\n\ndeclaration of a mistrial.\"\n\nC.   Sufficiency of the Evidence at the Second Trial\n\n            The facts which follow are described in the terms most\n\nfavorable to the verdict of guilt, as to the denial of the motion\n\nfor judgment on the pleadings.           United States v. Morillo, 158 F.3d\n\n18, 22 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            The crime of conviction requires that the government have\n\nshown beyond a reasonable doubt that Weems was a \"felon\" and was\n\n\"in possession of a firearm.\"           That Weems was a felon there is no\n\ndispute.    This aspect of his appeal questions whether he was \"in\n\npossession\" of the firearm.\n\n            Weems argues that there was insufficient evidence of\n\neither actual possession or constructive possession.               The jury was\n\ninstructed on both theories.                 Weems correctly says that mere\n\nproximity   to     a    weapon   is    not   sufficient    to   show   actual    or\n\nconstructive possession.         See United States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90,\n\n99 (1st Cir. 2002).        The defense theory was that Weems had only an\n\nattenuated connection with 11 Padelford Street, that people went in\n\nand out of the apartment (including some troubled youth who had met\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fthere that day in a program), and that the gun was left there by\n\nsomeone else.\n\n           The evidence was adequate; much more than mere proximity\n\nwas shown here.   The gun was found on the bed just after Weems fell\n\nthere and was made to stand up.        One of the officers who had\n\nconducted the security sweep testified that, in doing so, he had\n\nlifted the mattress and box spring and slid them apart somewhat,\n\nand had noticed no gun.    Smith said she did not have any firearms\n\nin the apartment.\n\n           The gun came from somewhere.    Defense counsel did not\n\nargue that the gun was planted by the police; in light of the\n\ntestimony by an informant that had seen Weems with this very gun\n\nearlier, such a hypothesis for the sudden presence of the gun would\n\nfail.   The fact that the police did not see the gun in Weems's hand\n\nand failed to see it fall with him onto the bed hardly helps him.\n\nA gun tucked in Weems's waistband or inside his shirt would be\n\neasily dislodged in the scuffle.   The jury had sufficient evidence\n\nto conclude that there was actual possession.\n\nD.   Evidentiary Rulings\n\n           A trial court's determination of the scope of cross-\n\nexamination is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See United States\n\nv. Morla-Trinidad, 100 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1996).          The same\n\nstandard applies to challenges to evidentiary rulings made by the\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\ftrial court, other than of legal interpretations of the rules. See\n\nSmith, 292 F.3d at 98.\n\n            Weems first objects to the government's cross-examination\n\nof his witness, Sandra Hurt, a neighbor and relation of Smith who\n\nwas in front of 11 Padelford during some of the police activity.\n\nThe government was permitted to ask about what Hurt had observed at\n\nthe house on previous occasions, but not about what she had been\n\ntold by others.    She testified as to \"activity\" at 11 Padelford but\n\ndid not specify what it was.           Weems objects on appeal that the\n\nwitness left the clear and prejudicial impression that this was a\n\ndrug house.      At trial the objections were intermittent but, in\n\nWeems's favor, we will take them as preserved.                 As in Smith, 292\n\nF.3d at 97-98, the evidence of drug dealing at the house was\n\nrelevant.   It certainly gave Weems a motive to have the gun on him.\n\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).             Indeed, given the defense theory,\n\nSmith's testimony could be viewed as helpful to Weems, which may\n\nexplain the intermittent nature of the objections.                In any event,\n\nthe   district   court    did   not   abuse   its   discretion      in   finding\n\nprejudice outweighed by the probative value of this evidence.\n\n            Potentially    more   significant       is   the    restriction   of\n\nWeems's cross-examination of a Providence detective concerning\n\ncertain details of the lenience granted to the informant on other\n\ncharges.    That informant's crucial statements both tied the weapon\n\nto Weems and supported the exigent circumstances entry.                  However,\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fno proper foundation was laid for the particular questions at\n\nissue.   Moreover, the informant's credibility was roundly attacked\n\nin other portions of cross-examination, which elicited both the\n\nexistence of a cooperation agreement and the informant's prior\n\ncriminal record.     The additional examination that was denied could\n\nhave elicited no more than a feather's weight on top of what was\n\nbefore the jury about his credibility.           There was no error.\n\n              Finally, Weems appeals from restrictions on his cross-\n\nexamination of Troiano about the failure to get a search warrant\n\nand   about    controlled   weapons    buys.      Our   disposition   of   the\n\nsuppression issue renders these lines of questioning immaterial.\n\nE.    Jury Instructions\n\n              The jury was instructed that the government had to show\n\nthat the gun had \"previously traveled in interstate commerce or it\n\npreviously [had] been transported across State lines, even though\n\nit wasn't in the Defendant's possession at the time.\"             The court\n\nalso instructed that the government did not have to show that\n\ndefendant transported the gun across state lines.           Weems belatedly\n\nrequested an instruction that the jury had to find that Weems\n\nhimself caused the gun to be transported across state lines.\n\n              Putting aside the issue of possible waiver, we reject the\n\nargument.      The proposed instruction was an incorrect statement of\n\nthe law.       The instruction given followed Scarborough v. United\n\nStates, 431 U.S. 563, 575 (1977).              We do not view the Supreme\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fCourt's decision in Jones, 529 U.S. at 848, as altering this\n\nprecedent to require that the felon be the one who transported the\n\nfirearm in interstate commerce.    Nor do the other circuits which\n\nhave addressed the question. See United States v. Lemons, 302 F.3d\n\n769, 771-73 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 642 (2002); United\n\nStates v. Singletary 268 F.3d 196, 199-205 (3d Cir. 2001), cert.\n\ndenied, 535 U.S. 976 (2002); United States v. Santiago, 238 F.3d\n\n213, 215-17 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1046 (2001);   United\n\nStates v. Dorris, 236 F.3d 582, 584-86 (10th Cir. 2000), cert.\n\ndenied, 532 U.S. 986 (2001).\n\n           Weems raises other objections to the jury instructions on\n\nappeal, but concedes that he failed to preserve them before the\n\ndistrict court.   The standard of review is therefore plain error,\n\nUnited States v. Crochiere, 129 F.3d 233, 237 (1st Cir. 1997), and\n\nhis arguments are without merit.\n\nF.   Sentence\n\n           Playing off Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000),\n\nWeems makes two arguments to challenge his sentence, one of which\n\nwe have already rejected and the other of which we reject now.\n\n           In United States v. Moore, 286 F.3d 47, 50-51 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 123 S. Ct 242 (2002), we rejected the argument that\n\nthe government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at trial the\n\npredicate convictions underlying an ACCA sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f           We now reject the argument that the phrase \"not less than\n\nfifteen years\" in the ACCA is a statutory maximum as well as a\n\nminimum.    See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).      As the district court\n\ncorrectly stated, the \"not less than\" language does not establish\n\na statutory maximum. In fact, the maximum is life imprisonment and\n\nWeems was sentenced below that, so no Apprendi problem is raised.\n\nSee United States v. Mack, 229 F.3d 226, 229 n.4 (3d Cir. 2000),\n\ncert. denied, 532 U.S. 1045 (2001).\n\nG. Conclusion\n\n           The conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f",

He was\n\nsentenced to 282 months of imprisonment.      On appeal, Weems argues\n\nthat the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal and his motion to suppress.        He also appeals various\n\naspects of evidentiary rulings, the jury instructions, and the\n\nsentencing.    We affirm.\n\n            We reject the argument that Jones v.

We\n\nalso reject the argument that the phrase \"not less than fifteen\n\nyears\" for sentences under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n\nsee 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), sets a maximum as well as a minimum\n\nsentence.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            A brief summary of the facts sets the stage. On December\n\n11, 2000, the date Weems was arrested, the police had information\n\nthat he was wanted on two state arrest warrants; that he had been\n\nseen by an informant carrying the firearm at issue here earlier\n\nthat day; that he was suspected of armed robbery; and that he was\n\nbelieved to be dealing drugs from a house at 11 Padelford Street in\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island, where he had been seen regularly.     After\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\freceiving a report from a confidential informant that Weems was at\n\nthe address, the police went quickly to the house without obtaining\n\na separate search warrant.       There, they saw Weems through a window\n\nand entered the house.       Weems hid in the attic but his feet went\n\nthrough the attic floor to the bedroom below, and the police\n\nassisted his delivery into the room by pulling on his legs while he\n\nclung to the rafters.       Weems fell on a bed and there was a tussle.\n\nWithin seconds the police spotted a gun on the bed where Weems had\n\nfallen -- the same unusual gun, a \"Thunder Five\" revolver that\n\ncould fire shotgun shells, with which he had been seen earlier that\n\nday.    He was arrested.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            We start with the appeal from the denial of the motion to\n\nsuppress, because its outcome affects the appeal from the motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal.\n\nA.     The Motion to Suppress\n\n            We describe the facts found by the district court judge,\n\nwhich were established at a two-day evidentiary hearing.\n\n            Weems   moved   to   suppress   the   evidence   seized   at   11\n\nPadelford Street, including the gun.        The basis for the motion was\n\nthat the initial entry into the residence, which was rented by\n\nKatisha Smith, was not justified by the state arrest warrant for\n\nWeems; that the police had used the arrest warrant as a pretext to\n\nenter the house and did not have a search warrant as was needed;\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fand that, in any event, the seized gun should be suppressed because\n\nit   was   not   in   plain   view   and    it   was    found   pursuant   to   an\n\nunauthorized search after a protective sweep had already taken\n\nplace.\n\n            The district court assumed that the entry into the house\n\nwas valid and held it was irrelevant whether the house was Weems's\n\ndwelling or only Smith's dwelling.               The court stated, \"The only\n\nissue here is whether the outstanding arrest warrant was used by\n\nthe agents as a pretext for conducting a warrantless search and\n\nwhether the items seized were the fruits of such a warrantless\n\nsearch\" as opposed to a protective sweep.              The court found that the\n\ngun was in plain view and was lawfully seized pursuant to a\n\nprotective sweep.1       See Maryland v. Buie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112384\"><a href=\"/opinion/112384/maryland-v-buie/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 334-36\n\n(1990).    Indeed, in discussing the seizure of the gun, the court\n\nreferred to concerns for the officer's safety \"because Mr. Weems\n\nhad a lengthy criminal record for violent crimes, armed robbery.\"\n\nThe district court did suppress other evidence taken from the\n\nhouse, which the court found was not seized pursuant either to\n\nWeems's arrest or to a protective sweep.\n\n            When the officers arrived at the address, they knew that\n\nWeems had a lengthy criminal record, that there were two state\n\n\n\n      1\n          \"A 'protective sweep' is a quick and limited search of\npremises, incident to an arrest and conducted to protect the safety\nof police officers or others.\" Maryland v. Buie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112384\"><a href=\"/opinion/112384/maryland-v-buie/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327\n(1990).\n\n                                      -4-\n\farrest warrants for him, and that Weems had been seen carrying the\n\ngun earlier that day.          One warrant was on a suspended sentence\n\nviolation related to a prior sentence for felony assault with a\n\ndangerous weapon.      They also had information that \"True\" Weems and\n\n\"Understanding\"       Yates   had     conducted    armed   robberies    in    the\n\nProvidence    area;    the    armed    robbers    were   known   as   the    \"Five\n\nPercenter Group.\" In late October, a reliable informant told Agent\n\nEdward Troiano of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\n\nFirearms that Weems had been staying off and on at 11 Padelford\n\nStreet for the past few weeks or months and was dealing drugs from\n\nthat address. In early November the police arrested Yates, but his\n\ncompanions, including Weems, escaped.\n\n             On December 11, an informant told Troiano that Weems was\n\nthen inside the Padelford Street home and that he was armed with\n\nhis shotgun revolver.         Troiano contacted Providence police, and\n\nwent with police officers to the address about half an hour later.\n\nThey did not try to obtain a search warrant for the residence.\n\n             Outside the building, Troiano encountered Smith, who\n\nlived there, and told her they had an arrest warrant for Weems.\n\nShe said that no one lived with her, that no one was in the house,\n\nand that she did not know Weems.              A picture is worth a thousand\n\nwords: while he was talking to Smith out front, other officers saw\n\nWeems stick his head and torso out of a rear window of the house.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fThey called up to Weems but he disappeared inside.   He was told to\n\ncome outside; he did not.\n\n            Troiano testified that, had the officers not seen Weems,\n\nthey would have left.     Because they did see Weems, it became a\n\ndifferent matter.   They told Smith they had seen Weems in the house\n\nand asked for the key.   She declined, but when told the alternative\n\nwas that the police would break down the door, she handed over the\n\nkey.   The police opened the door to the house and yelled that they\n\nwere police and had a warrant for Weems's arrest.       There was no\n\nresponse.\n\n            The officers started a protective sweep of the house,\n\nincluding the two bedrooms; this routinely involves looking to be\n\nsure no one is hiding under beds or behind furniture.   The officers\n\ndid not find Weems, but they noticed a small opening to the attic\n\nin a closet and yelled for Weems to come down.           They heard\n\nfootsteps above and sprayed pepper spray into the attic.     Weems's\n\nfeet broke through the ceiling once and he pulled himself back up\n\ninto the attic; when it happened again the officers pulled him\n\nthrough into the room below.     Understandably, the officers paid\n\nattention to his hands, which were still in the attic.    No officer\n\nsaw Weems hold a gun or saw a gun on his way down.       On the bed,\n\nWeems landed face down and kept his hands underneath himself.     He\n\nwas subdued by the police and made to stand up; as he was being\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\farrested and moved from the room, an officer looked down at the bed\n\nand saw the shotgun revolver on the box spring.\n\n              Weems argues that the entry into the house violated the\n\nFourth Amendment, as did the seizure of the gun.                  If Weems\n\neffectively lived at 11 Padelford, the arrest warrant itself would\n\nbe enough to authorize entry into his residence to effectuate his\n\narrest.    Payton v.

Assuming Weems may raise the Fourth Amendment claim, the\n\nquestion is whether exigent circumstances were present. See Joyce,\n\n112 F.3d at 22.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n           The government argues that the Steagald rule does not\napply when it is the arrestee rather than the resident who raises\nthe Fourth Amendment issue. There is authority from some circuits\nto support the government's view. See United States v. Gorman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780332\"><a href=\"/opinion/780332/united-states-v-clarence-kenneth-gorman/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1110-11 (9th Cir. 2002); United States v.

Steagald itself\nsays that \"most modern commentators agree that a search warrant is\nnecessary to fully protect the privacy interests of third parties\nwhen their home is searched for the subject of an arrest warrant.\"\n421 U.S. at 208 n.3 (citing commentators). The leading treatise\ndescribes analyses that would not apply Steagald to the arrestee's\nclaim as \"bizarre reasoning [which] would render the Steagald rule\na virtual nullity.\" 5 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure, § 11.3(b),\nat 143 (3d ed. 1996). \"If individuals are precluded from objecting\nto warrantless entries and searches of homes by their lack of\nstanding, little incentive remains for law enforcement officers to\ncomply with the warrant rules announced in Payton and Steagald.\"\nJ.D. Harbaugh & N.L. Faust, \"Knock on Any Door\" -- Home Arrests\nAfter Payton and Steagald, 86 Dick. L. Rev. 191 (1982).\n           Here, since we assume that Smith and not Weems is the\nresident, the government's view might bar Weems from raising the\nclaim.    For purposes of this appeal, we will assume without\ndeciding, in Weems's favor, that he may bring the claim.\n\n                                    -8-\n\f          The government argued to the trial court that the initial\n\nentry was justified by exigent circumstances and we agree.    Weems\n\nwas known to be armed with a dangerous weapon and to have a history\n\nof assault; he was seen at the premises and was evidently trying to\n\nescape; he had the opportunity to destroy or hide drugs or the gun,\n\nboth illegal in his hands.   There was a need to act quickly, and\n\nWeems had been given ample opportunity to surrender. See generally\n\nFletcher, 196 F.3d at 49-51 (discussing exigent circumstances).\n\nThe initial entry did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n\n          The focus of Weems's argument to the district court was\n\nthat the arrest warrant was a \"pretext\" used by the Providence\n\npolice to raid a house for which they had no search warrant.    The\n\nentire premise of the attack is misplaced.   The question is not one\n\nof pretext, and the subjective intent of the police plays no role\n\nin the analysis of a motion to suppress under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nSee Whren v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118036\"><a href=\"/opinion/118036/whren-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 813 (1996).   Rather, the\n\nquestion is whether the entry and later activities were objectively\n\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n          The district court was also quite correct to conclude\n\nthat the gun was found in plain view in the course of the arrest,\n\nso we need not reach the other grounds for affirmance offered by\n\nthe government.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fB.   Arguments Based on the First Trial\n\n           The first trial on these charges ended in a mistrial, to\n\nwhich Weems consented.         See United States v. Weems, No. 01-2080\n\n(1st Cir. August 23, 2001) (order).\n\n           Weems attempts to use the first trial in several ways.\n\nHe argues that the court erred in not granting a judgment of\n\nacquittal at the end of the first trial.             Our recent decision in\n\nUnited States v.

We do not see why not.         Weems says his argument\n\nfollows from an emerging doctrine that a prosecutor may not argue\n\ninconsistent theories to a jury.        In support he cites K. Miller,\n\nFeature,   Combating    the     Prosecutor's    Improper    Utilization      of\n\nInconsistent Theories, 26 Champion 16, 18 (June 2002).                 See also\n\nSmith v.

We see no\n\nrisk to defendants' rights when two different juries are involved.\n\nIn any event, we think the logic of Julien also forecloses this\n\nattack.\n\n           Finally,    Weems    attempts   to   go   back   to   the    initial\n\ndeclaration of mistrial in order to undo it and raise a double\n\njeopardy argument now. This is another attempt to argue that there\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fis insufficient basis to show that Weems consented to the mistrial.\n\nWe have already disposed of this claim in our order of August 23,\n\n2001, in response to his earlier appeal, which stated, \"the record\n\nin   this   case       makes   clear   that    defendant    consented    to     the\n\ndeclaration of a mistrial.\"\n\nC.   Sufficiency of the Evidence at the Second Trial\n\n            The facts which follow are described in the terms most\n\nfavorable to the verdict of guilt, as to the denial of the motion\n\nfor judgment on the pleadings.           United States v. Morillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198160\"><a href=\"/opinion/198160/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            The crime of conviction requires that the government have\n\nshown beyond a reasonable doubt that Weems was a \"felon\" and was\n\n\"in possession of a firearm.\"           That Weems was a felon there is no\n\ndispute.    This aspect of his appeal questions whether he was \"in\n\npossession\" of the firearm.\n\n            Weems argues that there was insufficient evidence of\n\neither actual possession or constructive possession.               The jury was\n\ninstructed on both theories.                 Weems correctly says that mere\n\nproximity   to     a    weapon   is    not   sufficient    to   show   actual    or\n\nconstructive possession.         See United States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199997\"><a href=\"/opinion/199997/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n99 (1st Cir. 2002).        The defense theory was that Weems had only an\n\nattenuated connection with 11 Padelford Street, that people went in\n\nand out of the apartment (including some troubled youth who had met\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fthere that day in a program), and that the gun was left there by\n\nsomeone else.\n\n           The evidence was adequate; much more than mere proximity\n\nwas shown here.   The gun was found on the bed just after Weems fell\n\nthere and was made to stand up.        One of the officers who had\n\nconducted the security sweep testified that, in doing so, he had\n\nlifted the mattress and box spring and slid them apart somewhat,\n\nand had noticed no gun.    Smith said she did not have any firearms\n\nin the apartment.\n\n           The gun came from somewhere.    Defense counsel did not\n\nargue that the gun was planted by the police; in light of the\n\ntestimony by an informant that had seen Weems with this very gun\n\nearlier, such a hypothesis for the sudden presence of the gun would\n\nfail.   The fact that the police did not see the gun in Weems's hand\n\nand failed to see it fall with him onto the bed hardly helps him.\n\nA gun tucked in Weems's waistband or inside his shirt would be\n\neasily dislodged in the scuffle.   The jury had sufficient evidence\n\nto conclude that there was actual possession.\n\nD.   Evidentiary Rulings\n\n           A trial court's determination of the scope of cross-\n\nexamination is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See United States\n\nv. Morla-Trinidad, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197073\"><a href=\"/opinion/197073/united-states-v-morla-trinidad/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st Cir. 1996).          The same\n\nstandard applies to challenges to evidentiary rulings made by the\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\ftrial court, other than of legal interpretations of the rules. See\n\nSmith, 292 F.3d at 98.\n\n            Weems first objects to the government's cross-examination\n\nof his witness, Sandra Hurt, a neighbor and relation of Smith who\n\nwas in front of 11 Padelford during some of the police activity.\n\nThe government was permitted to ask about what Hurt had observed at\n\nthe house on previous occasions, but not about what she had been\n\ntold by others.    She testified as to \"activity\" at 11 Padelford but\n\ndid not specify what it was.           Weems objects on appeal that the\n\nwitness left the clear and prejudicial impression that this was a\n\ndrug house.      At trial the objections were intermittent but, in\n\nWeems's favor, we will take them as preserved.                 As in Smith, 292\n\nF.3d at 97-98, the evidence of drug dealing at the house was\n\nrelevant.   It certainly gave Weems a motive to have the gun on him.\n\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).             Indeed, given the defense theory,\n\nSmith's testimony could be viewed as helpful to Weems, which may\n\nexplain the intermittent nature of the objections.                In any event,\n\nthe   district   court    did   not   abuse   its   discretion      in   finding\n\nprejudice outweighed by the probative value of this evidence.\n\n            Potentially    more   significant       is   the    restriction   of\n\nWeems's cross-examination of a Providence detective concerning\n\ncertain details of the lenience granted to the informant on other\n\ncharges.    That informant's crucial statements both tied the weapon\n\nto Weems and supported the exigent circumstances entry.                  However,\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fno proper foundation was laid for the particular questions at\n\nissue.   Moreover, the informant's credibility was roundly attacked\n\nin other portions of cross-examination, which elicited both the\n\nexistence of a cooperation agreement and the informant's prior\n\ncriminal record.     The additional examination that was denied could\n\nhave elicited no more than a feather's weight on top of what was\n\nbefore the jury about his credibility.           There was no error.\n\n              Finally, Weems appeals from restrictions on his cross-\n\nexamination of Troiano about the failure to get a search warrant\n\nand   about    controlled   weapons    buys.      Our   disposition   of   the\n\nsuppression issue renders these lines of questioning immaterial.\n\nE.    Jury Instructions\n\n              The jury was instructed that the government had to show\n\nthat the gun had \"previously traveled in interstate commerce or it\n\npreviously [had] been transported across State lines, even though\n\nit wasn't in the Defendant's possession at the time.\"             The court\n\nalso instructed that the government did not have to show that\n\ndefendant transported the gun across state lines.           Weems belatedly\n\nrequested an instruction that the jury had to find that Weems\n\nhimself caused the gun to be transported across state lines.\n\n              Putting aside the issue of possible waiver, we reject the\n\nargument.      The proposed instruction was an incorrect statement of\n\nthe law.       The instruction given followed Scarborough v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109672\"><a href=\"/opinion/109672/scarborough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575 (1977).
