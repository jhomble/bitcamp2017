If the defendant is found  by the\n        court to be in the possession of a controlled\n        substance, the court shall terminate the term\n        of   supervised   release  and   require  the\n        defendant to  serve in  prison not less  than\n        one-third of the term of supervised release.\n\n                              I.\n                       Factual Context\n                                      \n\n        Defendant-appellant Glenn Derek  Dow was sentenced on\n\ndrug charges in April of  1989 to imprisonment for a  term of\n\nsixteen  months  to  be  followed   by  a  six-year  term  of\n\nsupervised  release.   One  of the  conditions of  supervised\n\nrelease  was  that Dow  \"shall  not  purchase, possess,  use,\n\ndistribute  or administer  any  narcotic or  other controlled\n\nsubstance, except as prescribed by a physician.\"\n\n        In  June  of  1991,   the  probation  office   sought\n\nrevocation of  Dow's supervised release because  eleven urine\n\ntests  proved positive  for the  use of  marijuana.1   At the\n\nrevocation  hearing before  the  district court  on July  19,\n\n1991,  Dow was  represented by  counsel.   After being  fully\n\n                    \n\n1 The probation office alleged two other violations, but they\nare not issues on this appeal.\n\n                             -6-\n\nadvised of his  rights Dow  pled guilty to  violation of  the\n\nsupervised release condition.   His counsel advised the court\n\nthat she  concurred in defendant's decision  to plead guilty.\n\nNo  reservations or  qualifications were made  a part  of the\n\nplea.\n\n        At  the subsequent  sentencing hearing,  the district\n\ncourt found and ruled as follows:\n\n           The  Court further  finds on  the evidence\n        that this defendant has been in possession of\n        a  controlled  substance, to  wit, marijuana,\n        within  the  meaning  of  18  U.S.C.  section\n        3583(g)  during  the  period   of  supervised\n        release.\n\n           The  Court  concludes  that  defendant  is\n        subject to  a minimum sentence of  2 years of\n        incarceration, see 18 U.S.C. Section 3583(g),\n        and  a maximum  term of  three years,  see 18\n        U.S.C. 3583(e)(3).\n\n           The  Court  concludes that  the applicable\n        guideline   range    under   the   applicable\n        guideline  pursuant to section  7B1.4(a) is 4\n        to 10 months.\n\n           The  Court  further  concludes   that  the\n        statutory command of 3583(g) controls in this\n        case   and  mandates   a   minimum  term   of\n        incarceration of two years.\n\n                             II.\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n        Dow's  only contention on  appeal is that  the use or\n\nconsumption  of  marijuana,  evidenced solely  by  laboratory\n\nanalysis of urine samples, did not constitute \"possession\" of\n\nmarijuana  within the  meaning of  18 U.S.C.    3583(g).   We\n\npoint out first that Dow  pled guilty, without reservation or\n\n                             -7-\n\nqualification,  to violating his supervised release condition\n\nthat  he \"shall  not  purchase, possess,  use, distribute  or\n\nadminister any narcotic or other  controlled substance. . . .\n\n\"      In  light of  his guilty  plea,  which was  voluntary,\n\nknowing and made  with advice of counsel,  we do not  see how\n\nDow can  now deny  that he  was not \"in  the possession  of a\n\ncontrolled  substance,\" as stated in   3583(g).  Dow did not,\n\nas his brief implies, limit his plea to accepting the results\n\nof  the laboratory analyses of his urine samples.  His guilty\n\nplea  admitted  the  possession  and  use of  a  narcotic  or\n\ncontrolled  substance.   That  is sufficient  to trigger  the\n\nsentencing mandate of 18 U.S.C.   3583(g).\n\n        We  proceed, nonetheless,  to  a  full discussion  of\n\ndefendant's argument.   Dow first points  out that Sentencing\n\nGuideline   7B1.4 prescribes a sentence of four to ten months\n\nfor  an offender such as  himself, who has  committed grade C\n\nviolations  of  his supervised  release  and  has a  criminal\n\nhistory category of II.  This is, of course, shorter than the\n\ntwo-year sentence mandated by  18 U.S.C.   3583(g) (one-third\n\nof Dow's supervised release term of six years).\n\n        Defendant's  main  argument is  that  a  study of  18\n\nU.S.C.    3583(d)  and  18  U.S.C.    3563(b)(8)  shows  that\n\nCongress made a sharp  distinction between use or consumption\n\n                             -8-\n\nof  a drug and possession of that  drug.2  We find nothing in\n\nthe wording of    3583(d) or   3563(b)(8) that  even suggests\n\nsuch a distinction.  Dow attempts to buttress his argument by\n\ninvoking  \"policy  reasoning\":    a  defendant  possessing  a\n\ncontrolled substance  can cause  considerable social harm  by\n\nselling or otherwise distributing drugs in her/his possession\n\nto others; \"use\"  alone, however, limits  the direct harm  to\n\nthe defendant alone.   This is an ingenious argument,  but it\n\nis spun out of whole cloth.  There is  no basis for it in the\n\nwording of the statute or its legislative history.  Nor do we\n\nthink  that the Senate's rejection  of a proposed  draft of  \n\n3583(g), which  would have  required a  defendant to  serve a\n\nprison  term  of  not less  than  one-third  of  the term  of\n\nsupervised  release  if he/she  tested  positive  for use  of\n\n                    \n\n2 18 U.S.C.   3583(d) provides in pertinent part:\n\n           (d)  Conditions of supervised release. The\n           (d)  Conditions of supervised release.\n        court  shall order, as  an explicit condition\n        of supervised release, that the defendant not\n        commit another Federal, State, or local crime\n        during the term  of supervision and  that the\n        defendant  not   possess  illegal  controlled\n        substances.\n\n  Under 18 U.S.C.    3563(b)(8), a court may, as  a condition\nof sentence, order a defendant to:\n\n           (8)    refrain   from  excessive  use   of\n        alcohol,  or any  use of  a narcotic  drug or\n        other  controlled  substance,  as defined  in\n        section  102 of the Controlled Substances Act\n        (21 U.S.C. 802), without  a prescription by a\n        licensed medical practitioner;\n\n                             -9-\n\ncontrolled  substances  after  three  separate  urine  tests,\n\naffords any  footing for  appellant's argument.   His \"policy\n\nreasoning\"  should be directed to  the Congress.   We find no\n\nambiguity in the statute and thus reject defendant's plea for\n\napplication of the rule of lenity.\n\n        We  do not  stand  alone in  our  rejection of  Dow's\n\nargument.  His  contention has been  rejected by all  federal\n\ncourts  of appeal that have considered it.  See United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

If the defendant is found  by the\n        court to be in the possession of a controlled\n        substance, the court shall terminate the term\n        of   supervised   release  and   require  the\n        defendant to  serve in  prison not less  than\n        one-third of the term of supervised release.\n\n                              I.\n                       Factual Context\n                                      \n\n        Defendant-appellant Glenn Derek  Dow was sentenced on\n\ndrug charges in April of  1989 to imprisonment for a  term of\n\nsixteen  months  to  be  followed   by  a  six-year  term  of\n\nsupervised  release.   One  of the  conditions of  supervised\n\nrelease  was  that Dow  \"shall  not  purchase, possess,  use,\n\ndistribute  or administer  any  narcotic or  other controlled\n\nsubstance, except as prescribed by a physician.\"\n\n        In  June  of  1991,   the  probation  office   sought\n\nrevocation of  Dow's supervised release because  eleven urine\n\ntests  proved positive  for the  use of  marijuana.1   At the\n\nrevocation  hearing before  the  district court  on July  19,\n\n1991,  Dow was  represented by  counsel.   After being  fully\n\n                    \n\n1 The probation office alleged two other violations, but they\nare not issues on this appeal.\n\n                             -6-\n\nadvised of his  rights Dow  pled guilty to  violation of  the\n\nsupervised release condition.   His counsel advised the court\n\nthat she  concurred in defendant's decision  to plead guilty.\n\nNo  reservations or  qualifications were made  a part  of the\n\nplea.\n\n        At  the subsequent  sentencing hearing,  the district\n\ncourt found and ruled as follows:\n\n           The  Court further  finds on  the evidence\n        that this defendant has been in possession of\n        a  controlled  substance, to  wit, marijuana,\n        within  the  meaning  of  18  U.S.C.  section\n        3583(g)  during  the  period   of  supervised\n        release.\n\n           The  Court  concludes  that  defendant  is\n        subject to  a minimum sentence of  2 years of\n        incarceration, see 18 U.S.C. Section 3583(g),\n        and  a maximum  term of  three years,  see 18\n        U.S.C. 3583(e)(3).\n\n           The  Court  concludes that  the applicable\n        guideline   range    under   the   applicable\n        guideline  pursuant to section  7B1.4(a) is 4\n        to 10 months.\n\n           The  Court  further  concludes   that  the\n        statutory command of 3583(g) controls in this\n        case   and  mandates   a   minimum  term   of\n        incarceration of two years.\n\n                             II.\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n        Dow's  only contention on  appeal is that  the use or\n\nconsumption  of  marijuana,  evidenced solely  by  laboratory\n\nanalysis of urine samples, did not constitute \"possession\" of\n\nmarijuana  within the  meaning of  18 U.S.C.    3583(g).   We\n\npoint out first that Dow  pled guilty, without reservation or\n\n                             -7-\n\nqualification,  to violating his supervised release condition\n\nthat  he \"shall  not  purchase, possess,  use, distribute  or\n\nadminister any narcotic or other  controlled substance. . . .\n\n\"      In  light of  his guilty  plea,  which was  voluntary,\n\nknowing and made  with advice of counsel,  we do not  see how\n\nDow can  now deny  that he  was not \"in  the possession  of a\n\ncontrolled  substance,\" as stated in   3583(g).  Dow did not,\n\nas his brief implies, limit his plea to accepting the results\n\nof  the laboratory analyses of his urine samples.  His guilty\n\nplea  admitted  the  possession  and  use of  a  narcotic  or\n\ncontrolled  substance.   That  is sufficient  to trigger  the\n\nsentencing mandate of 18 U.S.C.   3583(g).\n\n        We  proceed, nonetheless,  to  a  full discussion  of\n\ndefendant's argument.   Dow first points  out that Sentencing\n\nGuideline   7B1.4 prescribes a sentence of four to ten months\n\nfor  an offender such as  himself, who has  committed grade C\n\nviolations  of  his supervised  release  and  has a  criminal\n\nhistory category of II.  This is, of course, shorter than the\n\ntwo-year sentence mandated by  18 U.S.C.   3583(g) (one-third\n\nof Dow's supervised release term of six years).\n\n        Defendant's  main  argument is  that  a  study of  18\n\nU.S.C.    3583(d)  and  18  U.S.C.    3563(b)(8)  shows  that\n\nCongress made a sharp  distinction between use or consumption\n\n                             -8-\n\nof  a drug and possession of that  drug.2  We find nothing in\n\nthe wording of    3583(d) or   3563(b)(8) that  even suggests\n\nsuch a distinction.  Dow attempts to buttress his argument by\n\ninvoking  \"policy  reasoning\":    a  defendant  possessing  a\n\ncontrolled substance  can cause  considerable social harm  by\n\nselling or otherwise distributing drugs in her/his possession\n\nto others; \"use\"  alone, however, limits  the direct harm  to\n\nthe defendant alone.   This is an ingenious argument,  but it\n\nis spun out of whole cloth.  There is  no basis for it in the\n\nwording of the statute or its legislative history.  Nor do we\n\nthink  that the Senate's rejection  of a proposed  draft of  \n\n3583(g), which  would have  required a  defendant to  serve a\n\nprison  term  of  not less  than  one-third  of  the term  of\n\nsupervised  release  if he/she  tested  positive  for use  of\n\n                    \n\n2 18 U.S.C.   3583(d) provides in pertinent part:\n\n           (d)  Conditions of supervised release. The\n           (d)  Conditions of supervised release.\n        court  shall order, as  an explicit condition\n        of supervised release, that the defendant not\n        commit another Federal, State, or local crime\n        during the term  of supervision and  that the\n        defendant  not   possess  illegal  controlled\n        substances.\n\n  Under 18 U.S.C.    3563(b)(8), a court may, as  a condition\nof sentence, order a defendant to:\n\n           (8)    refrain   from  excessive  use   of\n        alcohol,  or any  use of  a narcotic  drug or\n        other  controlled  substance,  as defined  in\n        section  102 of the Controlled Substances Act\n        (21 U.S.C. 802), without  a prescription by a\n        licensed medical practitioner;\n\n                             -9-\n\ncontrolled  substances  after  three  separate  urine  tests,\n\naffords any  footing for  appellant's argument.   His \"policy\n\nreasoning\"  should be directed to  the Congress.   We find no\n\nambiguity in the statute and thus reject defendant's plea for\n\napplication of the rule of lenity.\n\n        We  do not  stand  alone in  our  rejection of  Dow's\n\nargument.  His  contention has been  rejected by all  federal\n\ncourts  of appeal that have considered it.  See United States\n                                                             \n\nv.
