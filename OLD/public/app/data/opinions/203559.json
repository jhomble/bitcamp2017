Plaintiff Wagner and Wagner Auto\n\nSales, Inc. appeals from the district court's entry of summary\n\njudgment rejecting its claims against defendant Land Rover North\n\nAmerica, Inc. under the Automobile Dealer's Day in Court Act, 15\n\nU.S.C.   §   1222   (\"ADDCA\"),   and    Mass.   Gen.   Laws   ch.   93B,   the\n\nMassachusetts \"Dealer's Bill of Rights.\" See generally Coady Corp.\n\nv. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc., 361 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nLRNA   terminated   a   2004   temporary    dealership   arrangement       with\n\nWagner, which led to this lawsuit.          The district court       wrote a\n\nthoughtful and meticulous opinion, Wagner & Wagner Auto Sales, Inc.\n\nv. Land Rover N. Am., Inc., 539 F. Supp. 2d 631 (D. Mass. 2008),\n\nwhich we affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n             We describe the undisputed material facts on which entry\n\nof summary judgment was based.\n\n             Wagner owned two luxury car dealerships in Massachusetts,\n\nwhich sold automobiles from manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz,\n\nBMW, Audi, and Jaguar.     In 1999, Wagner wanted to expand to include\n\nLand Rovers and reached an agreement with LRNA to that effect.\n\nThree years later, on October 21, 2002, LRNA and Wagner entered\n\ninto a Letter of Intent (\"2002 LOI\") that annulled and replaced the\n\n1999 agreement.      Under the 2002 LOI, Wagner would construct a\n\ncombined Land Rover/Jaguar dealership in Boylston, Massachusetts to\n\nbe opened by March 31, 2004.        In November 2003, however, Wagner\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\frequested to change the location of the proposed site for the\n\ndealership to Shrewsbury.           LRNA approved this request because it\n\nbelieved Shrewsbury was the superior site.\n\n            The parties amended the 2002 LOI on June 14, 2004 and\n\nentered into a second Letter of Intent (\"2004 LOI\"), which stated\n\nthat it incorporated any prior agreements and that its terms\n\ncontrolled in cases of conflict.            The 2004 LOI is the contract at\n\ndispute in this case.        Under the 2004 LOI, if Wagner met certain\n\nbenchmarks   it     would   receive    a     \"Temporary   Land     Rover   Dealer\n\nAgreement\" (\"TDA\"), which would terminate if Wagner did not timely\n\nconstruct    a    new    facility     in    Shrewsbury    meeting    particular\n\nrequirements. If Wagner met the first deadline on August 31, 2004,\n\nWagner would receive the TDA.         Wagner did so and received the TDA,\n\nthus   becoming    a    temporary    Land    Rover   dealer   at   the   Boylston\n\nlocation.\n\n            The 2004 LOI also established that the deadline for\n\ncompletion of construction of the permanent facility was February\n\n28, 2006.        It set interim deadlines for submission of plans,\n\nobtaining necessary regulatory approvals, and construction of the\n\nfacility in Shrewsbury.       The 2004 LOI also established a \"planning\n\nvolume\" of 250 Land Rovers and 150 Jaguars.               Paragraph 6 of the\n\n2004 LOI stated:        \"Time is of the essence with respect to this\n\nschedule.\"       The 2004 LOI provided a termination clause: that if\n\nWagner failed \"to meet any of the foregoing deadlines . . . this\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fAgreement and LOI shall, at Land Rover's option, expire and become\n\nnull and void . . . . Any such failure shall also constitute a\n\nsubstantial   and    material    breach      [of    the   TDA]   warranting    the\n\ntermination of [the TDA].\"\n\n           Sometime    after    opening      this    temporary    dealership   in\n\nBoylston in September 2004, Wagner concluded that the proposed\n\npermanent dealership in Shrewsbury would not be financially viable\n\nunder the specifications of the 2004 LOI.                  This was, in part,\n\nbecause LRNA had pulled one particular model -- the Freelander --\n\nfrom the market.      Moreover, Jaguar sales across the country had\n\nfallen precipitously since 2002, with new vehicle sales falling\n\nfrom 61,204 in 2002 to 20,683 in 2006.\n\n           Wagner did not meet the 2004 LOI's October 31, 2004\n\ninterim   deadline    for     applying    for      all    necessary    regulatory\n\napprovals.    Wagner also failed to meet the March 31, 2005 interim\n\ndeadline for furnishing detailed construction drawings to LRNA or\n\nidentifying a general contractor for the project.\n\n           On May 11, 2005, LRNA sent Wagner a letter advising that\n\nit had not met the March 31 deadline.                     Wagner requested an\n\nextension.     On    August    18,   2005,    LRNA    offered    a    twelve-month\n\nextension of the 2004 LOI deadlines \"subject to [Wagner] signing\n\namended agreements.\"     On August 29, Wagner responded and requested\n\nan extension of up to three years and suggested that it was the\n\nFord takeover of LRNA in 2000 that caused delays in construction of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe Land Rover/Jaguar dealership.          The letter also mentioned the\n\nnational decline in Jaguar sales.\n\n           In response, on September 19, LRNA reiterated its prior\n\noffer of a one-year extension and stated that it would reconsider\n\nthe size of the planning volume.             Wagner failed to respond in\n\nwriting.   LRNA sent a final letter on February 22, 2006 saying that\n\nWagner needed to contact Virginia Slocum, LRNA's liaison to the\n\ndealership,    by   February   28,   2006,   or   the   agreement   would   be\n\nterminated effective May 1, 2006.\n\n           When the parties could not come to agreement regarding an\n\nextension of the contract, LRNA sent a Notice of Termination to\n\nWagner on March 21, 2006, stating that the TDA would expire in\n\nninety days.    The letter stated that the grounds for termination\n\nincluded Wagner's failure to comply with the agreed upon deadlines\n\nunder the 2004 LOI.\n\n           Wagner brought suit in the district court contesting the\n\nvalidity of LRNA's termination under both Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B,\n\n§ 3 and the ADDCA, seeking damages, injunctive relief, and costs.1\n\nAfter the district court granted summary judgment in favor of LRNA,\n\nWagner timely appealed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\n\n\n     1\n          On appeal, Wagner does not challenge the district court's\ndecision with respect to the ADDCA.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fde novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Wagner.\n\nMellen v. Trs. of Boston Univ., 504 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Chapter 93B of the Massachusetts General Laws regulates\n\nbusiness practices among motor vehicle manufacturers, distributors,\n\nand dealers in Massachusetts.              Most recently amended in 2002, the\n\nchapter has two primary purposes.                 The first \"is to curb 'the\n\npotentially      oppressive       power    of   automobile     manufacturers   and\n\ndistributors          in   relation       to    their    affiliated     dealers.'\"\n\nCadillac/Oldsmobile/Nissan Ctr., Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 391\n\nF.3d 304, 306 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Beard Motors, Inc. v. Toyota\n\nMotor Distribs., Inc., 480 N.E. 2d 303, 306 (Mass. 1985)).                     The\n\nsecond    \"is    to    regulate    competition      in   the   retail   automobile\n\nindustry for the benefit of the public at large.\"                 Id. (citing Am.\n\nHonda Motor Co. v. Bernardi's, Inc., 735 N.E.2d 348, 354 (Mass.\n\n2000)).\n\n            Wagner claims that LRNA violated section 3 of the chapter\n\nin three ways.             First, Wagner argues that LRNA violated the\n\nchapter's requirement that terminations of dealerships be for good\n\ncause, largely because Wagner alleges that LRNA also breached the\n\n2004 LOI.       Second, Wagner argues that LRNA violated section 3 by\n\nacting in bad faith in terminating the agreement.                  Third, Wagner\n\nargues that LRNA failed to demonstrate good cause because it did\n\nnot give Wagner an opportunity to cure.\n\n            Section 3 of chapter 93B makes \"[u]nfair methods of\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fcompetition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" unlawful.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 3. Among the enumerated \"unfair methods\"\n\nand \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" section 5 makes the\n\ntermination of a motor vehicle franchise agreement unlawful under\n\ncertain conditions.    Id. § 5. Under section 5, \"[i]t shall be a\n\nviolation of subsection (a) of section 3 for a manufacturer,\n\ndistributor or franchisor representative without good cause, in bad\n\nfaith or in an arbitrary or unconscionable manner . . . to terminate\n\nthe franchise agreement of a motor vehicle dealer . . . .\"\n\n          In Coady Corporation, we held that \"arbitrariness\" under\n\nchapter 93B cannot be shown if the defendant's actions were based\n\non \"reasonable business practices.\" 361 F.3d at 56. It is only the\n\negregious decision which can be labeled \"arbitrary or unfair.\"   The\n\nchapter was not intended to protect dealers from the normal risks\n\nof a free economy.    Id.\n\nA.   Good Cause Under Chapter 93B\n\n          The district court analyzed good cause under two different\n\nsubsections of section 5.   Section 5(h) provides:\n\n           For purposes of this section, good cause may\n           be found if the motor vehicle dealer failed to\n           comply with or observe a provision of the\n           franchise agreement that is material to the\n           franchise relationship, including without\n           limitation . . . facility requirements, which\n           were communicated in writing to the motor\n           vehicle dealer within a reasonable period\n           before the effective date of the termination\n           or   nonrenewal,   such  that   a   reasonable\n           opportunity to cure was afforded.\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(h).    This section allows the court to\n\nmake the good cause determination on the basis of a material breach\n\nconcerning facility requirements alone. The district court assigned\n\n\"heavy weight\" to the breaches under section 5(h). Wagner & Wagner,\n\n539 F. Supp. 2d at 470.\n\n          The district court also held that, alternatively, there\n\nwas good cause for termination in considering the enumerated factors\n\nunder section 5(j), which provides:\n\n          In determining whether good cause has been\n          established for terminating, refusing to extend\n          or renew or changing or modifying the\n          obligations of the motor vehicle dealer as a\n          condition to offering a renewal, replacement or\n          succeeding franchise agreement, the court shall\n          consider all pertinent circumstances, that may\n          include, but shall not be limited to: . . . the\n          existence and materiality of any breaches,\n          defaults or violations by the affected motor\n          vehicle dealer of the terms or provisions of\n          the   existing   franchise  agreement   or   of\n          applicable law.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(j).2\n\n     2\n          The section lists six other factors: (1) the amount of\nbusiness transacted by the affected motor vehicle dealer during the\nthree-year period immediately preceding such notice as compared to\nthe business available to it; (2) the investment necessarily made\nand obligations incurred by the affected motor vehicle dealer to\nperform its obligations under the existing franchise agreement; (3)\nthe permanency of the investment of the affected motor vehicle\ndealer; (4) whether it is injurious or beneficial to the public\nwelfare for the franchise agreement of the affected motor vehicle\ndealer to expire, to be modified, or to be terminated, or for the\naffected motor vehicle dealer to be replaced; (5) whether the\naffected motor vehicle dealer has adequate motor vehicle sales and\nservice facilities, equipment, vehicle parts and qualified\npersonnel to reasonably provide for the needs of the consumers for\nmotor vehicles handled by the affected motor vehicle dealer; (6)\n\n                                -8-\n\f              Under the terms of the chapter, the burden is on LRNA to\n\nestablish good cause to terminate the franchise.               Id. § 5(m).      The\n\ndistrict court correctly held that Wagner's \"failure to meet the\n\ninterim construction deadlines and the final facility completion\n\ndeadlines\" violated the terms of the 2004 LOI, and that Wagner's\n\nbreach was material.      Wagner & Wagner, 539 F. Supp. 2d at 470.               On\n\nthe undisputed facts, we agree that LRNA established good cause\n\nunder both section 5(h) and section 5(j).               The court's finding is\n\nwell-supported in the record. The terms of the 2004 LOI and the TDA\n\nmade it clear that completion of the Shrewsbury site dealership was\n\na condition precedent to LRNA ultimately granting Wagner a non-\n\ntemporary Land Rover Dealer Agreement.            Id.\n\n              Wagner never met any of the deadlines in the 2004 LOI\n\nafter obtaining the TDA.       Ron Wagner, the owner of Wagner, conceded\n\nthat    the   plaintiff   never   applied   for    any    of   the    permits    or\n\nregulatory approvals necessary to comply with the October 31, 2004\n\ndeadline.       He also conceded that Wagner failed to supply the\n\nrequired detailed construction drawings in compliance with the 2004\n\nLOI's   March    31,   2005   deadline.     He    admitted     that   a   general\n\ncontractor was never identified or hired, and conceded that no site\n\nwork ever even started. That site work was required to be completed\n\nby September 30, 2005. Wagner thus failed to meet the September 30,\n\n\nwhether the affected motor vehicle dealer has been and is rendering\nadequate services to the public. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(j).\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f2005 interim deadline and never opened the permanent facility by\n\nFebruary 28, 2006, the completion date stated in the 2004 LOI.\n\n          On appeal, Wagner argues that its failure to perform is\n\nexcused by what it alleges was LRNA's failure to approve in writing\n\nWagner's preliminary construction plans and that it could not\n\nprovide final detailed construction drawings until the preliminary\n\ndrawings were approved by LRNA.    LRNA's alleged failure to meet its\n\nobligations in turn prevented Wagner from performing by complying\n\nwith the later deadlines of September 30, 2005 and February 28,\n\n2006.\n\n          The argument fails.     We bypass the question of whether\n\nWagner preserved this argument in the district court.         We are\n\ndoubtful the issue was preserved because the facts offered by Wagner\n\nas disputed went to a different defense -- that regardless of the\n\nterms of the LOI there was a changed economic landscape of Land\n\nRover and Jaguar sales warranting Wagner's non-compliance. See\n\nBoston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., 9 F.3d 175, 180 (1st\n\nCir. 1993)); Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure §\n\n2716, at 282-86 (3d ed. 1998).\n\n          Even taking the argument that LRNA failed to approve the\n\nplans as preserved, there is no merit to it.   The record shows that\n\nwhatever Ron Wagner's initial uncertainty at deposition as to\n\nwhether LRNA responded to Wagner's architectural drawings, Ron\n\nWagner admitted that the drawings \"did finally come back, but I\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcan't remember the dates.\"              Upon further questioning, Ron Wagner\n\nadmitted that the reason Wagner did not move ahead with applications\n\nfor permits in compliance with the 2004 LOI was that he \"lost\n\nfocus,\" rather than because of LRNA's failure to approve the\n\ndrawings.       The record is clear that Wagner received the requisite\n\napproval of      preliminary plans from LRNA. George Delaney, the LRNA\n\nrepresentative who worked with Wagner, testified at his deposition,\n\n\"[w]e       approved   the    preliminary       drawings,     the   size   that   they\n\nsubmitted.\"       He further testified that after a meeting discussing\n\nthe preliminary drawings and approving them \"subject to the Wagners'\n\narchitect making certain revisions,\" Delaney \"advised the Wagners\n\nthat they had met the first milestone under the LOI.\"\n\n               Wagner's      argument    that    LRNA   was    in   breach   of    its\n\nobligations depends on a misrepresentation of the record.                         Since\n\nWagner was undeniably in breach of its contractual obligations, LRNA\n\nhad good cause under sections 5(h) and 5(j).\n\nB.   Bad Faith\n\n               Under chapter 93B, the burden of showing bad faith is on\n\nthe dealer, Wagner.           Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(m).             Plaintiff\n\nargues generally that LRNA showed bad faith3 in terminating the\n\n\n        3\n          Wagner contends that the Massachusetts covenant of good\nfaith and fair dealing implied into contracts should define bad\nfaith under chapter 93B.     Plaintiff argues that, in light of\nWagner's initial investment in the dealership, LRNA's alleged\nfailure to approve the plans, the need for a reduced facility due\nto the decline in market conditions, and the evidence of ongoing\nnegotiations between the parties, there was a breach of the implied\n\n                                         -11-\n\ffranchise agreement or that the question at least presents a triable\n\nissue of fact.\n\n          There is no evidence of bad faith and so no need to test\n\nwhether there can ever be a finding of bad faith when good cause has\n\nbeen established under section 5(h).   This court has explained that\n\n\"[b]ad faith may encompass broader conduct under chapter 93B than\n\nmere coercion or intimidation.\"   General GMC, Inc. v. Volvo White\n\nTruck Corp., 918 F.2d 306, 309 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing Tober Foreign\n\nMotors, Inc. v. Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc., 381 N.E.2d 908 (Mass.\n\n1978)) (interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 4(1), which then\n\nincluded language later    amended and moved to § 5). Even so,\n\nplaintiff failed to present any evidence whatsoever of bad faith on\n\nthe part of LRNA.   LRNA simply enforced the terms of the 2004 LOI\n\nfor which the parties had bargained.      Although Wagner may have\n\nwished to change the terms of the 2004 LOI in light of changed\n\nmarket conditions, \"chapter 93B was not meant to insulate dealers\n\nfrom the ordinary flux of pressure and striving that is part of a\n\nfree economy.\" Coady Corp., 361 F.3d at 56.\n\nC.   Opportunity to Cure\n\n          We turn to Wagner's argument that nonetheless it should\n\nprevail because LRNA failed to provide an opportunity to cure\n\nconsistent with good cause as defined in chapter 93B.       A court\n\n\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing. The reference to a common\nlaw doctrine, however, adds nothing to Wagner's statutory claim.\n\n                               -12-\n\fexamining whether there was good cause for termination may consider\n\na number of different criteria, including whether the distributor\n\ngave the automobile dealer a reasonable opportunity to cure.                      The\n\ncure   provision    states       that   courts     may   find   \"good   cause   [for\n\ntermination]     . . . if the motor vehicle dealer failed to comply\n\nwith [requirements that] . . . were communicated in writing to the\n\nmotor vehicle dealer within a reasonable period before the effective\n\ndate of the termination or nonrenewal, such that a reasonable\n\nopportunity to cure was afforded.\"               Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(h)\n\n(emphasis added).          The district court correctly found on the\n\nundisputed facts that LRNA had repeatedly offered Wagner reasonable\n\nopportunity to cure.\n\n            When Wagner failed to meet its initial obligations, LRNA's\n\nVice President of Franchise Operations sent a letter on May 16, 2005\n\nasking Wagner why the March 31 deadline had not been met.                   LRNA's\n\nletter emphasized that time was of the essence and that material\n\nbreaches would be enforced.               Wagner responded, saying that the\n\nchanged business outlook for Land Rover and Jaguar sales meant that\n\nit needed more time to adjust its business model, and Wagner's\n\nresponse,   on     July    13,    2005,    requested      an    extension   for    an\n\nunspecified date.         On August 18, 2005, LRNA responded to Wagner's\n\nrequest by offering (i) a one-year extension of the completion date\n\nand (ii) a reduction in the size of the facility subject to Wagner\n\nsigning amended agreements.             Wagner rejected LRNA's proposal and\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\finstead sought an extension of up to three years.                   On those facts\n\nalone, Wagner's claim of inadequacy of an opportunity to cure fails.\n\n            LRNA rejected Wagner's counterproposal for a three-year\n\nextension on September 19, 2005 and restated its previous offer.\n\nThe final letters in 2006, which granted LRNA more than sixty days\n\nnotice until the effective termination date, put Wagner on notice\n\nof its contractual breach and gave Wagner repeated opportunity to\n\ncure by offering to amend the deadlines.\n\n            Indeed, the documents from the time show that Wagner never\n\ncomplained   of    a   lack   of   an   opportunity        to    cure.      Rather   it\n\nexplained    its   failure    to   comply      was   due    to    adverse    economic\n\nconditions, including the decline in Jaguar sales and the removal\n\nof the Freelander model from the market.\n\n            We note that Wagner was not an established Land Rover\n\ndealer of many years faced with the loss of a dealership, a core\n\nconcern of the statute.       See Autohaus, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc.,\n\nNo. CIV. A. 92-103403-MA, 1993 WL 1503945 (D. Mass. Dec. 23, 1993)\n\n(manufacturer had good cause in terminating twenty-five-year-old\n\nestablished dealership for failure to build facility as required in\n\nfranchise agreement). Rather, Wagner was at the other end -- it was\n\na temporary dealer. It was given a temporary initial dealership\n\npursuant to the TDA and there were certain conditions precedent it\n\nhad to meet to be given a more permanent dealership.                     It failed to\n\nmeet those conditions.\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fD.    Oral Modification to the 2004 LOI\n\n              As    a    last   resort,    Wagner    argues    that      its    written\n\ncontractual obligations were modified orally by agreement of the\n\nparties.      The district court correctly held there was no evidence\n\nof oral modification.           The plain language of the 2004 LOI forbids\n\namending    the     agreement     \"in     any   manner   except    by    an    executed\n\ninstrument in writing duly executed by an officer of the party to\n\nbe charged.\"\n\n              Still, it is true that Massachusetts law allows claims of\n\noral modification of written contracts contravening such contract\n\nlanguage.      See Cambridgeport Savs. Bank v. Boersner, 597 N.E.2d\n\n1017, 1022 (Mass. 1992) (\"[A] provision that an agreement may not\n\nbe amended orally but only by a written                     instrument does not\n\nnecessarily bar oral modification of the contract.\").                     State law,\n\nhowever,      imposes      stringent    proof     requirements     for    such     oral\n\nmodification.           Massachusetts courts have made clear that \"[t]he\n\nevidence of a subsequent oral modification must be of sufficient\n\nforce to overcome the presumption that the integrated and complete\n\nagreement, which requires written consent to modification, expresses\n\nthe intent of the parties.\"             Id. at 1022, n.10; see also Beal Bank\n\nS.S.B. v.

Gen. Laws ch. 93B, the Massachusetts \"Dealer's Bill of Rights.\" <i>See generally </i><i>Coady Corp. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc.,</i> 361 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.2004). LRNA terminated a 2004 temporary dealership arrangement with Wagner, which led to this lawsuit. The district court wrote a thoughtful and meticulous opinion, <i>Wagner &amp; Wagner Auto Sales, Inc. v. Land Rover N. Am., Inc.,</i> 539 F.Supp.2d 461 (D.Mass.2008), which we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We describe the undisputed material facts on which entry of summary judgment was based.</p>\n<p>Wagner owned two luxury car dealerships in Massachusetts, which sold automobiles from manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, and Jaguar. In 1999, Wagner wanted to expand to include Land Rovers and reached an agreement with LRNA to that effect. Three years later, on October 21, 2002, LRNA and Wagner entered into a Letter of Intent (\"2002 LOI\") that annulled and replaced the 1999 agreement. Under the 2002 LOI, Wagner would construct a combined Land Rover/Jaguar dealership in Boylston, Massachusetts to be opened by March 31, 2004. In November 2003, however, Wagner requested to change the location of the proposed site for the dealership to Shrewsbury. LRNA approved this request because it believed Shrewsbury was the superior site.</p>\n<p>The parties amended the 2002 LOI on June 14, 2004 and entered into a second Letter of Intent (\"2004 LOI\"), which stated that it incorporated any prior agreements and that its terms controlled in cases of conflict. The 2004 LOI is the contract at dispute in this case. Under the 2004 LOI, if Wagner met certain benchmarks it would receive a \"Temporary Land Rover Dealer Agreement\" (\"TDA\"), which would terminate if Wagner did not timely construct a new facility in Shrewsbury meeting particular requirements. If Wagner met the first deadline on August 31, 2004, Wagner would receive the TDA. Wagner did so and received the TDA, thus becoming a temporary Land Rover dealer at the Boylston location.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> The 2004 LOI also established that the deadline for completion of construction of the permanent facility was February 28, 2006. It set interim deadlines for submission of plans, obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, and construction of the facility in Shrewsbury. The 2004 LOI also established a \"planning volume\" of 250 Land Rovers and 150 Jaguars. Paragraph 6 of the 2004 LOI stated: \"Time is of the essence with respect to this schedule.\" The 2004 LOI provided a termination clause: that if Wagner failed \"to meet any of the foregoing deadlines ... this Agreement and LOI shall, at Land Rover's option, expire and become null and void.... Any such failure shall also constitute a substantial and material breach [of the TDA] warranting the termination of [the TDA].\"</p>\n<p>Sometime after opening this temporary dealership in Boylston in September 2004, Wagner concluded that the proposed permanent dealership in Shrewsbury would not be financially viable under the specifications of the 2004 LOI. This was, in part, because LRNA had pulled one particular modelthe Freelanderfrom the market. Moreover, Jaguar sales across the country had fallen precipitously since 2002, with new vehicle sales falling from 61,204 in 2002 to 20,683 in 2006.</p>\n<p>Wagner did not meet the 2004 LOI's October 31, 2004 interim deadline for applying for all necessary regulatory approvals. Wagner also failed to meet the March 31, 2005 interim deadline for furnishing detailed construction drawings to LRNA or identifying a general contractor for the project.</p>\n<p>On May 11, 2005, LRNA sent Wagner a letter advising that it had not met the March 31 deadline. Wagner requested an extension. On August 18, 2005, LRNA offered a twelve-month extension of the 2004 LOI deadlines \"subject to [Wagner] signing amended agreements.\" On August 29, Wagner responded and requested an extension of up to three years and suggested that it was the Ford takeover of LRNA in 2000 that caused delays in construction of the Land Rover/Jaguar dealership. The letter also mentioned the national decline in Jaguar sales.</p>\n<p>In response, on September 19, LRNA reiterated its prior offer of a one-year extension and stated that it would reconsider the size of the planning volume. Wagner failed to respond in writing. LRNA sent a final letter on February 22, 2006 saying that Wagner needed to contact Virginia Slocum, LRNA's liaison to the dealership, by February 28, 2006, or the agreement would be terminated effective May 1, 2006.</p>\n<p>When the parties could not come to agreement regarding an extension of the contract, LRNA sent a Notice of Termination to Wagner on March 21, 2006, stating that the TDA would expire in ninety days. The letter stated that the grounds for termination included Wagner's failure to comply with the agreed upon deadlines under the 2004 LOI.</p>\n<p>Wagner brought suit in the district court contesting the validity of LRNA's termination under both Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 3 and the ADDCA, seeking damages, injunctive relief, and costs.<sup>[1]</sup> After the district court granted summary judgment in favor of LRNA, Wagner timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> reasonable inferences in favor of Wagner. <i>Mellen v. Trs. of Boston Univ.,</i> 504 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Chapter 93B of the Massachusetts General Laws regulates business practices among motor vehicle manufacturers, distributors, and dealers in Massachusetts. Most recently amended in 2002, the chapter has two primary purposes. The first \"is to curb `the potentially oppressive power of automobile manufacturers and distributors in relation to their affiliated dealers.'\" <i>Cadillac/Oldsmobile/Nissan Ctr., Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 391 F.3d 304, 306 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Beard Motors, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc.,</i> 395 Mass. 428, 480 N.E.2d 303, 306 (1985)). The second \"is to regulate competition in the retail automobile industry for the benefit of the public at large.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Am. Honda Motor Co. v. Bernardi's, Inc.,</i> 432 Mass. 425, 735 N.E.2d 348, 354 (2000)).</p>\n<p>Wagner claims that LRNA violated section 3 of the chapter in three ways. First, Wagner argues that LRNA violated the chapter's requirement that terminations of dealerships be for good cause, largely because Wagner alleges that LRNA also breached the 2004 LOI. Second, Wagner argues that LRNA violated section 3 by acting in bad faith in terminating the agreement. Third, Wagner argues that LRNA failed to demonstrate good cause because it did not give Wagner an opportunity to cure.</p>\n<p>Section 3 of chapter 93B makes \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" unlawful. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 3. Among the enumerated \"unfair methods\" and \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" section 5 makes the termination of a motor vehicle franchise agreement unlawful under certain conditions. <i>Id.</i> § 5. Under section 5, \"[i]t shall be a violation of subsection (a) of section 3 for a manufacturer, distributor or franchisor representative without good cause, in bad faith or in an arbitrary or unconscionable manner ... to terminate the franchise agreement of a motor vehicle dealer....\"</p>\n<p>In <i>Coady Corporation,</i> we held that \"arbitrariness\" under chapter 93B cannot be shown if the defendant's actions were based on \"reasonable business practices.\" 361 F.3d at 56. It is only the egregious decision which can be labeled \"arbitrary or unfair.\" The chapter was not intended to protect dealers from the normal risks of a free economy. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Good Cause Under Chapter 93B</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court analyzed good cause under two different subsections of section 5. Section 5(h) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>For purposes of this section, good cause may be found if the motor vehicle dealer failed to comply with or observe a provision of the franchise agreement that is material to the franchise relationship, including without limitation ... facility requirements, which were communicated in writing to the motor vehicle dealer within a reasonable period before the effective date of the termination or nonrenewal, such that a reasonable opportunity to cure was afforded.</blockquote>\n<p>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(h). This section allows the court to make the good cause determination on the basis of a material breach concerning facility requirements alone. The district court assigned \"heavy weight\" to the breaches under section 5(h). <i>Wagner &amp; Wagner,</i> 539 F.Supp.2d at 470.</p>\n<p>The district court also held that, alternatively, there was good cause for termination in considering the enumerated factors under section 5(j), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>In determining whether good cause has been established for terminating, refusing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> to extend or renew or changing or modifying the obligations of the motor vehicle dealer as a condition to offering a renewal, replacement or succeeding franchise agreement, the court shall consider all pertinent circumstances, that may include, but shall not be limited to:... the existence and materiality of any breaches, defaults or violations by the affected motor vehicle dealer of the terms or provisions of the existing franchise agreement or of applicable law.</blockquote>\n<p>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(j).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the terms of the chapter, the burden is on LRNA to establish good cause to terminate the franchise. <i>Id.</i> § 5(m). The district court correctly held that Wagner's \"failure to meet the interim construction deadlines and the final facility completion deadlines\" violated the terms of the 2004 LOI, and that Wagner's breach was material. <i>Wagner &amp; Wagner,</i> 539 F.Supp.2d at 470. On the undisputed facts, we agree that LRNA established good cause under both section 5(h) and section 5(j). The court's finding is well-supported in the record. The terms of the 2004 LOI and the TDA made it clear that completion of the Shrewsbury site dealership was a condition precedent to LRNA ultimately granting Wagner a non-temporary Land Rover Dealer Agreement. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Wagner never met any of the deadlines in the 2004 LOI after obtaining the TDA. Ron Wagner, the owner of Wagner, conceded that the plaintiff never applied for any of the permits or regulatory approvals necessary to comply with the October 31, 2004 deadline. He also conceded that Wagner failed to supply the required detailed construction drawings in compliance with the 2004 LOI's March 31, 2005 deadline. He admitted that a general contractor was never identified or hired, and conceded that no site work ever even started. That site work was required to be completed by September 30, 2005. Wagner thus failed to meet the September 30, 2005 interim deadline and never opened the permanent facility by February 28, 2006, the completion date stated in the 2004 LOI.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Wagner argues that its failure to perform is excused by what it alleges was LRNA's failure to approve in writing Wagner's preliminary construction plans and that it could not provide final detailed construction drawings until the preliminary drawings were approved by LRNA. LRNA's alleged failure to meet its obligations in turn prevented Wagner from performing by complying with the later deadlines of September 30, 2005 and February 28, 2006.</p>\n<p>The argument fails. We bypass the question of whether Wagner preserved this argument in the district court. We are doubtful the issue was preserved because the facts offered by Wagner as disputed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> went to a different defense-that regardless of the terms of the LOI there was a changed economic landscape of Land Rover and Jaguar sales warranting Wagner's non-compliance. <i>See </i><i>Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co.,</i> 9 F.3d 175, 180 (1st Cir.1993); 10A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 2716, at 282-86 (3d ed.1998).</p>\n<p>Even taking the argument that LRNA failed to approve the plans as preserved, there is no merit to it. The record shows that whatever Ron Wagner's initial uncertainty at deposition as to whether LRNA responded to Wagner's architectural drawings, Ron Wagner admitted that the drawings \"did finally come back, but I can't remember the dates.\" Upon further questioning, Ron Wagner admitted that the reason Wagner did not move ahead with applications for permits in compliance with the 2004 LOI was that he \"lost focus,\" rather than because of LRNA's failure to approve the drawings. The record is clear that Wagner received the requisite approval of preliminary plans from LRNA. George Delaney, the LRNA representative who worked with Wagner, testified at his deposition, \"[w]e approved the preliminary drawings, the size that they submitted.\" He further testified that after a meeting discussing the preliminary drawings and approving them \"subject to the Wagners' architect making certain revisions,\" Delaney \"advised the Wagners that they had met the first milestone under the LOI.\"</p>\n<p>Wagner's argument that LRNA was in breach of its obligations depends on a misrepresentation of the record. Since Wagner was undeniably in breach of its contractual obligations, LRNA had good cause under sections 5(h) and 5(j).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Bad Faith</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under chapter 93B, the burden of showing bad faith is on the dealer, Wagner. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(m). Plaintiff argues generally that LRNA showed bad faith<sup>[3]</sup> in terminating the franchise agreement or that the question at least presents a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence of bad faith and so no need to test whether there can ever be a finding of bad faith when good cause has been established under section 5(h). This court has explained that \"[b]ad faith may encompass broader conduct under chapter 93B than mere coercion or intimidation.\" <i>General GMC, Inc. v. Volvo White Truck Corp.,</i> 918 F.2d 306, 309 (1st Cir.1990) (citing <i>Tober Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc.,</i> 376 Mass. 313, 381 N.E.2d 908 (1978)) (interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 4(1), which then included language later amended and moved to § 5). Even so, plaintiff failed to present any evidence whatsoever of bad faith on the part of LRNA. LRNA simply enforced the terms of the 2004 LOI for which the parties had bargained. Although Wagner may have wished to change the terms of the 2004 LOI in light of changed market conditions, \"chapter 93B was not meant to insulate dealers from the ordinary flux of pressure and striving that is part of a free economy.\" <i>Coady Corp.,</i> 361 F.3d at 56.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> C. <i>Opportunity to Cure</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We turn to Wagner's argument that nonetheless it should prevail because LRNA failed to provide an opportunity to cure consistent with good cause as defined in chapter 93B. A court examining whether there was good cause for termination may consider a number of different criteria, including whether the distributor gave the automobile dealer a reasonable opportunity to cure. The cure provision states that courts may find \"good cause [for termination]... if the motor vehicle dealer failed to comply with [requirements that]... were communicated in writing to the motor vehicle dealer within a reasonable period before the effective date of the termination or nonrenewal, such that a <i>reasonable opportunity to cure was afforded.</i>\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(h) (emphasis added). The district court correctly found on the undisputed facts that LRNA had repeatedly offered Wagner reasonable opportunity to cure.</p>\n<p>When Wagner failed to meet its initial obligations, LRNA's Vice President of Franchise Operations sent a letter on May 16, 2005 asking Wagner why the March 31 deadline had not been met. LRNA's letter emphasized that time was of the essence and that material breaches would be enforced. Wagner responded, saying that the changed business outlook for Land Rover and Jaguar sales meant that it needed more time to adjust its business model, and Wagner's response, on July 13, 2005, requested an extension for an unspecified date. On August 18, 2005, LRNA responded to Wagner's request by offering (i) a one-year extension of the completion date and (ii) a reduction in the size of the facility subject to Wagner signing amended agreements. Wagner rejected LRNA's proposal and instead sought an extension of up to three years. On those facts alone, Wagner's claim of inadequacy of an opportunity to cure fails.</p>\n<p>LRNA rejected Wagner's counterproposal for a three-year extension on September 19, 2005 and restated its previous offer. The final letters in 2006, which granted LRNA more than sixty days notice until the effective termination date, put Wagner on notice of its contractual breach and gave Wagner repeated opportunity to cure by offering to amend the deadlines.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the documents from the time show that Wagner never complained of a lack of an opportunity to cure. Rather it explained its failure to comply was due to adverse economic conditions, including the decline in Jaguar sales and the removal of the Freelander model from the market.</p>\n<p>We note that Wagner was not an established Land Rover dealer of many years faced with the loss of a dealership, a core concern of the statute. <i>See Autohaus, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc.,</i> No. CIV. A. 92-103403-MA, 1993 WL 1503945 (D.Mass. Dec.23, 1993) (manufacturer had good cause in terminating twenty-five-year-old established dealership for failure to build facility as required in franchise agreement). Rather, Wagner was at the other end-it was a temporary dealer. It was given a temporary initial dealership pursuant to the TDA and there were certain conditions precedent it had to meet to be given a more permanent dealership. It failed to meet those conditions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Oral Modification to the 2004 LOI</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a last resort, Wagner argues that its written contractual obligations were modified orally by agreement of the parties. The district court correctly held there was no evidence of oral modification. The plain language of the 2004 LOI forbids amending the agreement \"in any manner except by an executed instrument in writing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> duly executed by an officer of the party to be charged.\"</p>\n<p>Still, it is true that Massachusetts law allows claims of oral modification of written contracts contravening such contract language. <i>See </i><i>Cambridgeport Savs. Bank v. Boersner,</i> 413 Mass. 432, 597 N.E.2d 1017, 1022 (1992) (\"[A] provision that an agreement may not be amended orally but only by a written instrument does not necessarily bar oral modification of the contract.\"). State law, however, imposes stringent proof requirements for such oral modification. Massachusetts courts have made clear that \"[t]he evidence of a subsequent oral modification must be of sufficient force to overcome the presumption that the integrated and complete agreement, which requires written consent to modification, expresses the intent of the parties.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1022, n. 10; <i>see also Beal Bank S.S.B. v. Krock,</i> No. 97-2241, 1998 WL 1085807, at *3 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Massachusetts ... impose[s] a heavy burden on the party seeking to modify an integrated written contract by subsequent oral agreement.\")</p>\n<p>There is no evidence of any oral modification sufficient to overcome the presumption that the 2004 LOI expresses the intent of the parties.

Plaintiff argues that, in light of Wagner's initial investment in the dealership, LRNA's alleged failure to approve the plans, the need for a reduced facility due to the decline in market conditions, and the evidence of ongoing negotiations between the parties, there was a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The reference to a common law doctrine, however, adds nothing to Wagner's statutory claim.</p>\n\n</div>",

LRNA terminated a 2004 temporary dealership arrangement with Wagner, which led to this lawsuit. The district court wrote a thoughtful and meticulous opinion, <i>Wagner &amp; Wagner Auto Sales, Inc. v. Land Rover N. Am., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2151361\"><a href=\"/opinion/2151361/wagner-and-wagner-auto-sales-inc-v-lrna/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2008), which we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We describe the undisputed material facts on which entry of summary judgment was based.</p>\n<p>Wagner owned two luxury car dealerships in Massachusetts, which sold automobiles from manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, and Jaguar. In 1999, Wagner wanted to expand to include Land Rovers and reached an agreement with LRNA to that effect. Three years later, on October 21, 2002, LRNA and Wagner entered into a Letter of Intent (\"2002 LOI\") that annulled and replaced the 1999 agreement. Under the 2002 LOI, Wagner would construct a combined Land Rover/Jaguar dealership in Boylston, Massachusetts to be opened by March 31, 2004. In November 2003, however, Wagner requested to change the location of the proposed site for the dealership to Shrewsbury. LRNA approved this request because it believed Shrewsbury was the superior site.</p>\n<p>The parties amended the 2002 LOI on June 14, 2004 and entered into a second Letter of Intent (\"2004 LOI\"), which stated that it incorporated any prior agreements and that its terms controlled in cases of conflict. The 2004 LOI is the contract at dispute in this case. Under the 2004 LOI, if Wagner met certain benchmarks it would receive a \"Temporary Land Rover Dealer Agreement\" (\"TDA\"), which would terminate if Wagner did not timely construct a new facility in Shrewsbury meeting particular requirements. If Wagner met the first deadline on August 31, 2004, Wagner would receive the TDA. Wagner did so and received the TDA, thus becoming a temporary Land Rover dealer at the Boylston location.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> The 2004 LOI also established that the deadline for completion of construction of the permanent facility was February 28, 2006. It set interim deadlines for submission of plans, obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, and construction of the facility in Shrewsbury. The 2004 LOI also established a \"planning volume\" of 250 Land Rovers and 150 Jaguars. Paragraph 6 of the 2004 LOI stated: \"Time is of the essence with respect to this schedule.\" The 2004 LOI provided a termination clause: that if Wagner failed \"to meet any of the foregoing deadlines ... this Agreement and LOI shall, at Land Rover's option, expire and become null and void.... Any such failure shall also constitute a substantial and material breach [of the TDA] warranting the termination of [the TDA].\"</p>\n<p>Sometime after opening this temporary dealership in Boylston in September 2004, Wagner concluded that the proposed permanent dealership in Shrewsbury would not be financially viable under the specifications of the 2004 LOI. This was, in part, because LRNA had pulled one particular modelthe Freelanderfrom the market. Moreover, Jaguar sales across the country had fallen precipitously since 2002, with new vehicle sales falling from 61,204 in 2002 to 20,683 in 2006.</p>\n<p>Wagner did not meet the 2004 LOI's October 31, 2004 interim deadline for applying for all necessary regulatory approvals. Wagner also failed to meet the March 31, 2005 interim deadline for furnishing detailed construction drawings to LRNA or identifying a general contractor for the project.</p>\n<p>On May 11, 2005, LRNA sent Wagner a letter advising that it had not met the March 31 deadline. Wagner requested an extension. On August 18, 2005, LRNA offered a twelve-month extension of the 2004 LOI deadlines \"subject to [Wagner] signing amended agreements.\" On August 29, Wagner responded and requested an extension of up to three years and suggested that it was the Ford takeover of LRNA in 2000 that caused delays in construction of the Land Rover/Jaguar dealership. The letter also mentioned the national decline in Jaguar sales.</p>\n<p>In response, on September 19, LRNA reiterated its prior offer of a one-year extension and stated that it would reconsider the size of the planning volume. Wagner failed to respond in writing. LRNA sent a final letter on February 22, 2006 saying that Wagner needed to contact Virginia Slocum, LRNA's liaison to the dealership, by February 28, 2006, or the agreement would be terminated effective May 1, 2006.</p>\n<p>When the parties could not come to agreement regarding an extension of the contract, LRNA sent a Notice of Termination to Wagner on March 21, 2006, stating that the TDA would expire in ninety days. The letter stated that the grounds for termination included Wagner's failure to comply with the agreed upon deadlines under the 2004 LOI.</p>\n<p>Wagner brought suit in the district court contesting the validity of LRNA's termination under both Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 3 and the ADDCA, seeking damages, injunctive relief, and costs.<sup>[1]</sup> After the district court granted summary judgment in favor of LRNA, Wagner timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> reasonable inferences in favor of Wagner. <i>Mellen v.

Most recently amended in 2002, the chapter has two primary purposes. The first \"is to curb `the potentially oppressive power of automobile manufacturers and distributors in relation to their affiliated dealers.'\" <i>Cadillac/Oldsmobile/Nissan Ctr., Inc. v. Gen.

First, Wagner argues that LRNA violated the chapter's requirement that terminations of dealerships be for good cause, largely because Wagner alleges that LRNA also breached the 2004 LOI. Second, Wagner argues that LRNA violated section 3 by acting in bad faith in terminating the agreement. Third, Wagner argues that LRNA failed to demonstrate good cause because it did not give Wagner an opportunity to cure.</p>\n<p>Section 3 of chapter 93B makes \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" unlawful. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 3. Among the enumerated \"unfair methods\" and \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" section 5 makes the termination of a motor vehicle franchise agreement unlawful under certain conditions. <i>Id.</i> § 5. Under section 5, \"[i]t shall be a violation of subsection (a) of section 3 for a manufacturer, distributor or franchisor representative without good cause, in bad faith or in an arbitrary or unconscionable manner ... to terminate the franchise agreement of a motor vehicle dealer....\"</p>\n<p>In <i>Coady Corporation,</i> we held that \"arbitrariness\" under chapter 93B cannot be shown if the defendant's actions were based on \"reasonable business practices.\" 361 F.3d at 56. It is only the egregious decision which can be labeled \"arbitrary or unfair.\" The chapter was not intended to protect dealers from the normal risks of a free economy. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Good Cause Under Chapter 93B</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court analyzed good cause under two different subsections of section 5. Section 5(h) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>For purposes of this section, good cause may be found if the motor vehicle dealer failed to comply with or observe a provision of the franchise agreement that is material to the franchise relationship, including without limitation ... facility requirements, which were communicated in writing to the motor vehicle dealer within a reasonable period before the effective date of the termination or nonrenewal, such that a reasonable opportunity to cure was afforded.</blockquote>\n<p>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(h). This section allows the court to make the good cause determination on the basis of a material breach concerning facility requirements alone. The district court assigned \"heavy weight\" to the breaches under section 5(h). <i>Wagner &amp; Wagner,</i> 539 F.Supp.2d at 470.</p>\n<p>The district court also held that, alternatively, there was good cause for termination in considering the enumerated factors under section 5(j), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>In determining whether good cause has been established for terminating, refusing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> to extend or renew or changing or modifying the obligations of the motor vehicle dealer as a condition to offering a renewal, replacement or succeeding franchise agreement, the court shall consider all pertinent circumstances, that may include, but shall not be limited to:... the existence and materiality of any breaches, defaults or violations by the affected motor vehicle dealer of the terms or provisions of the existing franchise agreement or of applicable law.</blockquote>\n<p>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(j).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the terms of the chapter, the burden is on LRNA to establish good cause to terminate the franchise. <i>Id.</i> § 5(m). The district court correctly held that Wagner's \"failure to meet the interim construction deadlines and the final facility completion deadlines\" violated the terms of the 2004 LOI, and that Wagner's breach was material. <i>Wagner &amp; Wagner,</i> 539 F.Supp.2d at 470. On the undisputed facts, we agree that LRNA established good cause under both section 5(h) and section 5(j). The court's finding is well-supported in the record. The terms of the 2004 LOI and the TDA made it clear that completion of the Shrewsbury site dealership was a condition precedent to LRNA ultimately granting Wagner a non-temporary Land Rover Dealer Agreement. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Wagner never met any of the deadlines in the 2004 LOI after obtaining the TDA. Ron Wagner, the owner of Wagner, conceded that the plaintiff never applied for any of the permits or regulatory approvals necessary to comply with the October 31, 2004 deadline. He also conceded that Wagner failed to supply the required detailed construction drawings in compliance with the 2004 LOI's March 31, 2005 deadline. He admitted that a general contractor was never identified or hired, and conceded that no site work ever even started. That site work was required to be completed by September 30, 2005. Wagner thus failed to meet the September 30, 2005 interim deadline and never opened the permanent facility by February 28, 2006, the completion date stated in the 2004 LOI.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Wagner argues that its failure to perform is excused by what it alleges was LRNA's failure to approve in writing Wagner's preliminary construction plans and that it could not provide final detailed construction drawings until the preliminary drawings were approved by LRNA. LRNA's alleged failure to meet its obligations in turn prevented Wagner from performing by complying with the later deadlines of September 30, 2005 and February 28, 2006.</p>\n<p>The argument fails. We bypass the question of whether Wagner preserved this argument in the district court. We are doubtful the issue was preserved because the facts offered by Wagner as disputed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> went to a different defense-that regardless of the terms of the LOI there was a changed economic landscape of Land Rover and Jaguar sales warranting Wagner's non-compliance. <i>See </i><i>Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195026\"><a href=\"/opinion/195026/boston-beer-company-v-slesar-bros/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span>, 180 (1st Cir.1993); 10A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 2716, at 282-86 (3d ed.1998).</p>\n<p>Even taking the argument that LRNA failed to approve the plans as preserved, there is no merit to it. The record shows that whatever Ron Wagner's initial uncertainty at deposition as to whether LRNA responded to Wagner's architectural drawings, Ron Wagner admitted that the drawings \"did finally come back, but I can't remember the dates.\" Upon further questioning, Ron Wagner admitted that the reason Wagner did not move ahead with applications for permits in compliance with the 2004 LOI was that he \"lost focus,\" rather than because of LRNA's failure to approve the drawings. The record is clear that Wagner received the requisite approval of preliminary plans from LRNA. George Delaney, the LRNA representative who worked with Wagner, testified at his deposition, \"[w]e approved the preliminary drawings, the size that they submitted.\" He further testified that after a meeting discussing the preliminary drawings and approving them \"subject to the Wagners' architect making certain revisions,\" Delaney \"advised the Wagners that they had met the first milestone under the LOI.\"</p>\n<p>Wagner's argument that LRNA was in breach of its obligations depends on a misrepresentation of the record. Since Wagner was undeniably in breach of its contractual obligations, LRNA had good cause under sections 5(h) and 5(j).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Bad Faith</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under chapter 93B, the burden of showing bad faith is on the dealer, Wagner. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(m). Plaintiff argues generally that LRNA showed bad faith<sup>[3]</sup> in terminating the franchise agreement or that the question at least presents a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence of bad faith and so no need to test whether there can ever be a finding of bad faith when good cause has been established under section 5(h). This court has explained that \"[b]ad faith may encompass broader conduct under chapter 93B than mere coercion or intimidation.\" <i>General GMC, Inc. v. Volvo White Truck Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551281\"><a href=\"/opinion/551281/general-gmc-inc-v-volvo-white-truck-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir.1990) (citing <i>Tober Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2006618\"><a href=\"/opinion/2006618/tober-foreign-motors-inc-v-reiter-oldsmobile-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2006618\"><a href=\"/opinion/2006618/tober-foreign-motors-inc-v-reiter-oldsmobile-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span> (1978)) (interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 4(1), which then included language later amended and moved to § 5). Even so, plaintiff failed to present any evidence whatsoever of bad faith on the part of LRNA. LRNA simply enforced the terms of the 2004 LOI for which the parties had bargained. Although Wagner may have wished to change the terms of the 2004 LOI in light of changed market conditions, \"chapter 93B was not meant to insulate dealers from the ordinary flux of pressure and striving that is part of a free economy.\" <i>Coady Corp.,</i> 361 F.3d at 56.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> C. <i>Opportunity to Cure</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We turn to Wagner's argument that nonetheless it should prevail because LRNA failed to provide an opportunity to cure consistent with good cause as defined in chapter 93B. A court examining whether there was good cause for termination may consider a number of different criteria, including whether the distributor gave the automobile dealer a reasonable opportunity to cure. The cure provision states that courts may find \"good cause [for termination]... if the motor vehicle dealer failed to comply with [requirements that]... were communicated in writing to the motor vehicle dealer within a reasonable period before the effective date of the termination or nonrenewal, such that a <i>reasonable opportunity to cure was afforded.</i>\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(h) (emphasis added). The district court correctly found on the undisputed facts that LRNA had repeatedly offered Wagner reasonable opportunity to cure.</p>\n<p>When Wagner failed to meet its initial obligations, LRNA's Vice President of Franchise Operations sent a letter on May 16, 2005 asking Wagner why the March 31 deadline had not been met. LRNA's letter emphasized that time was of the essence and that material breaches would be enforced. Wagner responded, saying that the changed business outlook for Land Rover and Jaguar sales meant that it needed more time to adjust its business model, and Wagner's response, on July 13, 2005, requested an extension for an unspecified date. On August 18, 2005, LRNA responded to Wagner's request by offering (i) a one-year extension of the completion date and (ii) a reduction in the size of the facility subject to Wagner signing amended agreements. Wagner rejected LRNA's proposal and instead sought an extension of up to three years. On those facts alone, Wagner's claim of inadequacy of an opportunity to cure fails.</p>\n<p>LRNA rejected Wagner's counterproposal for a three-year extension on September 19, 2005 and restated its previous offer. The final letters in 2006, which granted LRNA more than sixty days notice until the effective termination date, put Wagner on notice of its contractual breach and gave Wagner repeated opportunity to cure by offering to amend the deadlines.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the documents from the time show that Wagner never complained of a lack of an opportunity to cure. Rather it explained its failure to comply was due to adverse economic conditions, including the decline in Jaguar sales and the removal of the Freelander model from the market.</p>\n<p>We note that Wagner was not an established Land Rover dealer of many years faced with the loss of a dealership, a core concern of the statute. <i>See Autohaus, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc.,</i> No. CIV. A. 92-103403-MA, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1503945</span></span> (D.Mass. Dec.23, 1993) (manufacturer had good cause in terminating twenty-five-year-old established dealership for failure to build facility as required in franchise agreement). Rather, Wagner was at the other end-it was a temporary dealer. It was given a temporary initial dealership pursuant to the TDA and there were certain conditions precedent it had to meet to be given a more permanent dealership. It failed to meet those conditions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Oral Modification to the 2004 LOI</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a last resort, Wagner argues that its written contractual obligations were modified orally by agreement of the parties. The district court correctly held there was no evidence of oral modification. The plain language of the 2004 LOI forbids amending the agreement \"in any manner except by an executed instrument in writing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> duly executed by an officer of the party to be charged.\"</p>\n<p>Still, it is true that Massachusetts law allows claims of oral modification of written contracts contravening such contract language. <i>See </i><i>Cambridgeport Savs. Bank v. Boersner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2067037\"><a href=\"/opinion/2067037/cambridgeport-savings-bank-v-boersner/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2067037\"><a href=\"/opinion/2067037/cambridgeport-savings-bank-v-boersner/\"><span class=\"volume\">597</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span>, 1022 (1992) (\"[A] provision that an agreement may not be amended orally but only by a written instrument does not necessarily bar oral modification of the contract.\"). State law, however, imposes stringent proof requirements for such oral modification. Massachusetts courts have made clear that \"[t]he evidence of a subsequent oral modification must be of sufficient force to overcome the presumption that the integrated and complete agreement, which requires written consent to modification, expresses the intent of the parties.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1022, n. 10; <i>see also Beal Bank S.S.B. v. Krock,</i> No. 97-2241, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1085807</span></span>, at *3 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Massachusetts ... impose[s] a heavy burden on the party seeking to modify an integrated written contract by subsequent oral agreement.\")</p>\n<p>There is no evidence of any oral modification sufficient to overcome the presumption that the 2004 LOI expresses the intent of the parties. The evidence in the record shows that Wagner merely emphasized to the district court that negotiations were ongoing, without establishing the substance of the alleged oral modification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Entry of summary judgment for LRNA is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to LRNA.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  On appeal, Wagner does not challenge the district court's decision with respect to the ADDCA.</p>\n<p>[2]  The section lists six other factors: (1) the amount of business transacted by the affected motor vehicle dealer during the three-year period immediately preceding such notice as compared to the business available to it; (2) the investment necessarily made and obligations incurred by the affected motor vehicle dealer to perform its obligations under the existing franchise agreement; (3) the permanency of the investment of the affected motor vehicle dealer; (4) whether it is injurious or beneficial to the public welfare for the franchise agreement of the affected motor vehicle dealer to expire, to be modified, or to be terminated, or for the affected motor vehicle dealer to be replaced; (5) whether the affected motor vehicle dealer has adequate motor vehicle sales and service facilities, equipment, vehicle parts and qualified personnel to reasonably provide for the needs of the consumers for motor vehicles handled by the affected motor vehicle dealer; (6) whether the affected motor vehicle dealer has been and is rendering adequate services to the public. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 5(j).</p>\n<p>[3]  Wagner contends that the Massachusetts covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied into contracts should define bad faith under chapter 93B. Plaintiff argues that, in light of Wagner's initial investment in the dealership, LRNA's alleged failure to approve the plans, the need for a reduced facility due to the decline in market conditions, and the evidence of ongoing negotiations between the parties, there was a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The reference to a common law doctrine, however, adds nothing to Wagner's statutory claim.</p>\n\n</div>",
