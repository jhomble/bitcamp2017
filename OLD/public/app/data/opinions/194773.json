Having  reviewed   the  parties'\n                     \n\nsubmissions and  the district  court records,  we affirm  the\n\njudgment of  dismissal in  each of  these three  consolidated\n\nappeals.\n\n     In No. 92-2113, Mount seeks the return of cash ($18,400)\n\nand  property (135 \"autograph  letters\") that were  seized in\n\nconnection   with  his   criminal   prosecution.     In   the\n\nalternative,  he seeks  damages  for  the \"embezzlement\"  and\n\n\"misappropriation\"  of  such  property.     The  lower  court\n\nproperly characterized  each  of these  claims as  frivolous.\n\nDefendant (the  district court  judge who  presided over  the\n\ncriminal trial)  is protected by absolute immunity  as to any\n\nclaim for damages.  See,  e.g., Decker v. Hillsborough County\n                                                             \n\nAttorney's  Office, 845  F.2d  17, 21  (1st  Cir. 1988)  (per\n                  \n\ncuriam).  We rejected in  a previous appeal Mount's effort to\n\nregain possession of the currency.   Mount v. United  States,\n                                                            \n\nNo. 92-1576 (1st Cir. Mar. 16, 1993) (per curiam).   And Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P.  41(e) provides the proper avenue  for his effort\n\nto  regain possession of  the letters.   The record discloses\n\nthat he filed  such a motion  for just that purpose  on April\n\n22, 1992,  which the  district  court denied  on January  14,\n\n1993.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     The  remaining  two  appeals involve  28  U.S.C.    2255\n\npetitions.1   In  the  first, Mount  alleges  that the  trial\n\ncourt's refusal  to  subpoena, and/or  authorize  payment  of\n\ntravel  expenses  for,  various  witnesses  in  this  country\n\ndeprived  him of compulsory  process guaranteed by  the Sixth\n\nAmendment.  We rejected a nearly identical argument on direct\n\nappeal.   See United  States v. Mount,  896 F.2d  612, 620-21\n                                     \n\n(1st Cir.  1990).  Mount  alleges that, whereas  that earlier\n\nargument  involved  foreign  witnesses,   his  instant  claim\n\ninvolves  domestic witnesses.  Yet the only such witness here\n\nidentified  (Barbara Johnson) not  only was discussed  in the\n\ndirect  appeal  but  \"eventually paid  her  own  expenses and\n\ntestified at trial.\"   Id. at 620.   Mount fails to  identify\n                          \n\nthe  other  alleged  witnesses involved,  referring  to  them\n\nsimply  as \"autograph  dealers in  New York  and  Boston\" and\n\n\"associates and friends.\"  \n\n     In  the  remaining  appeal, Mount  alleges  that  he was\n\ndenied  the  right  to  confront  a  \"witness\"  named  Rodney\n\nArmstrong.   Yet  Armstrong did  not testify  at trial.   And\n\nthere is  no suggestion that  Mount was denied access  to the\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  district court dismissed each of these petitions sua\n                                                             \nsponte  without calling for  a response from  the government.\n      \nAs a result, the government did  not--indeed, was unable to--\nplead abuse of the writ below.  See, e.g., McCleskey v. Zant,\n                                                            \n111  S. Ct. 1454,  1470 (1991); Whittemore  v. United States,\n                                                            \n986  F.2d 575,  578 (1st  Cir. 1993) (\"The  burden is  on the\ngovernment to first plead abuse of the writ.\").  We therefore\nwill address the   2255 petitions on the merits.  \n\n                             -4-\n\nnotes  of the relevant FBI interview or was himself precluded\n\nfrom calling Armstrong as  a witness.  As such, this claim is\n\nlikewise baseless. \n\n     The  judgments are  affirmed.
