Boyle, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                    \n\n                                         \n\n                            Before\n\n                  Torruella, Cyr and Boudin,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n                                     \n\n                                         \n\nAdan Salazar on brief pro se.\n            \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per  Curiam.   Adan  Salazar  appeals the  district\n                     \n\ncourt's  denial  of  his request  to  vacate  or provide  for\n\ninstallment payments of a stand committed fine imposed on him\n\nin  1987 after  he pled  guilty to  conspiring to  distribute\n\ncocaine and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine.  We\n\naffirm.\n\n          In a letter,  Salazar asked the  district court  to\n\nvacate his  committed  fine,  or to  permit  its  payment  in\n\ninstallments while he  was on  parole.  He  asked for  relief\n\nfrom the fine because he had been scheduled to be released on\n\nparole, but his parole  had been made contingent on  the fine\n\nbeing paid or \"otherwise  disposed of by law.\"   Salazar told\n\nthe court  that, given his earning  power while incarcerated,\n\nhe  could not pay the fine.  Given his allegedly poor health,\n\nhe also suggested that the fine  \"flirt[ed] on the rim of the\n\nEighth Amendment ban on Cruel or Unusual Punishment.\" \n\n          The district court  treated Salazar's  letter as  a\n\nmotion to  correct a sentence under  Fed. R. Crim. P.  35 and\n\ndenied it as untimely.  The version of Rule 35  applicable to\n\nSalazar, whose offenses were committed in 1984, provided that\n\na  court could correct an \"illegal sentence\" at any time, but\n\nthat  it could  correct  a sentence  \"imposed  in an  illegal\n\nmanner\"  only within 120 days after the date of sentencing or\n\nwithin  120  days  after  the  date  of  the  last  appellate\n\ndisposition upholding the judgment of conviction.  The  court\n\nfound  that Salazar's fine was  not an illegal sentence since\n\nit was not \"ambiguous, contradictory,  incomplete, uncertain,\n\nor unauthorized\",  nor was  it \"in  excess  of the  statutory\n\nmaximum allowable for the  charges [or] in conflict  with any\n\napplicable law.\"    Given Salazar's  allegation that  \"proper\n\nconsideration [had]  not [been] given  to his ability  to pay\n\nthe fine,\"  the court concluded that  Salazar was challenging\n\nthe manner in which  his sentence had been imposed.   Because\n\nhis  challenge had not been brought  within the requisite 120\n\ndays, it denied his request for relief.\n\n          In its decision,  the district  court determined  a\n\npurely  legal question  -- whether  the fine was  an \"illegal\n\nsentence\" which could  be corrected  at any  time under  Rule\n\n35(a).   Given Salazar's argument to the court that presently\n                                                             \n\nhe  could not pay the fine  and the court's position that the\n\nfine had  been within the statutory maximum  and not contrary\n\nto other law  when imposed, we interpret  the court's opinion\n\nto  signify that a fine,  which was legal  when imposed, does\n                                                       \n\nnot become  illegal simply  because the defendant  cannot pay\n\nthe  fine when it comes due.  The only case on point which we\n\nhave found supports the court's conclusion.  In United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Blanton, 739 F.2d  209 (6th Cir. 1984), the  Sixth Circuit\n          \n\nconsidered whether a district court could vacate a fine as an\n\n\"illegal sentence\" where  the defendant had the  means to pay\n\nthe fine at the time it was imposed, but did not at  the time\n\nthe fine was due.   It found that the  defendant's subsequent\n\ninability  to pay  the  fine would  not  render the  fine  an\n\nillegal sentence  for Rule  35 purposes since,  when imposed,\n\n                             -3-\n\nthe   fine  had   been   authorized  by   \"the  judgment   of\n\nconviction.\"1  Id. at 211-12.   \n                  \n\n          Although the district  court's decision has support\n\nin precedent, we would  not confine the analysis to  Rule 35.\n\nWe think that Salazar's request  could also have been treated\n\nas a  28 U.S.C.   2255  motion, which is not  subject to Rule\n\n35's time limitations.   See, e.g., United States v. Santora,\n                                                            \n\n711 F.2d 41, 42 (5th Cir. 1983) (\"[m]indful of the liberality\n\naccorded pro se filings, we . . . construe [defendant's] ill-\n               \n\nstyled  Rule  35 pleading  as a  request  for relief  under  \n\n2255\").   Accordingly, we  proceed to resolve  the merits  of\n\nSalazar's claim.  \n\n          Salazar  seems  most concerned  with  the committed\n\nnature of  his fine in light of his impending parole.  To the\n\nextent  he believes that he  will remain in  prison until the\n\nfine is paid, and  that he will never obtain  release because\n\n                    \n\n1.  In Blanton,  the district  court had determined  that the\n              \nfine was an  \"illegal sentence\" which  could be corrected  at\nany time under Rule 35(a).   Once the defendant had lost  the\nmeans  to pay the fine, the court reasoned, it became illegal\nunder  Supreme  Court  law  forbidding the  incarceration  of\npersons  solely because  they could  not pay  their committed\nfine.   But  the  Sixth  Circuit  noted  that  that  law  was\ninapplicable   since   the   defendant   was   not   actually\nincarcerated.   Although  Salazar is  presently incarcerated,\nthe reasoning in the Blanton case applies nonetheless because\n                            \nSalazar  will not  remain incarcerated if  he cannot  pay the\nfine.  If shown to be indigent, Salazar will be released from\nprison.   See 28  U.S.C.    3569 (a  prisoner may  obtain his\n             \ndischarge without  paying his committed fine  by showing that\nhe  is an  indigent and by  taking an  oath to  that effect).\nThus, Salazar's position  is essentially the same as  that of\nthe defendant in Blanton.  \n                        \n\n                             -4-\n\nhis  earning power in prison is too  low to permit him to pay\n\nthe fine  in his lifetime, he  need not worry.   Upon showing\n\nthat he is  indigent, he may obtain his discharge  even if he\n\nhas not paid his fine.  See 28 U.S.C.    3569, supra footnote\n                                                    \n\n1.  \n\n          Salazar  also  appears  to  be  alleging  that  the\n\ncommitted portion of  the fine  was illegal at  the time  the\n\nfine was imposed because  he could not pay  the fine at  that\n\ntime.  As a general matter, courts have long been regarded as\n\nhaving the authority to  impose committed fines.   See United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Estrada de Castillo,  549 F.2d 583,  585 (9th Cir.\n                              \n\n1976)  (Hufstedler, J.,  concurring  specially).    The  only\n\nqualification was  that a prisoner could not  be confined for\n\nnot  paying a  fine  if  it  was  his  indigence  alone  that\n\nprevented him  from paying the fine.   See Tate v. Short, 401\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  395,  397-98  (1971)  (equal  protection  violation  to\n\nconfine a person solely because he did  not have the means to\n\npay  a fine); Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 240-41, 244\n                                  \n\n(1970)  (equal protection  violation  to  extend  a  person's\n\nprison term  solely because indigency made  it impossible for\n\nthe person to pay a fine).  Because defendants sentenced both\n\nto  a prison  term  and  a  committed  fine  could  obtain  a\n\ndischarge  of the  committed  portion of  the  fine under  28\n\nU.S.C.    3569 when their  prison term ended,  they have been\n\nfound to have  no standing to challenge the committed portion\n\n                             -5-\n\nof the fine on the basis of alleged indigence as  of the time\n                                                             \n\nthe fine  was imposed.  See, e.g., United States v. Levy, 897\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  597, 598 (1st Cir. 1989) (so holding and citing similar\n\ncases  from  other   circuits).    Thus,   Salazar's  alleged\n\nindigency at the  time of sentencing provides  no basis under\n\nthe Constitution for challenging his committed fine.  \n\n            Nor was the district court required by statute to\n\nconsider  Salazar's ability  to pay  the fine  at sentencing.\n\nSalazar's  offenses were committed  before December 31, 1984.\n\nAt  that time, 18 U.S.C.    3565, relating  to the collection\n\nand payment  of  fines  and  penalties,  did  not  require  a\n\nsentencing court  to consider  ability to  pay in  imposing a\n\nfine.   The Criminal  Fine  Enforcement Act  of 1984  amended\n\nsection 3565 to permit the imposition of committed fines only\n\nif the  court found \"by  a preponderance  of the  information\n\nrelied  upon in imposing sentence  that the defendant has the\n\npresent ability to pay a  fine or penalty.\"  See 18  U.S.C.  \n                                                \n\n3565(a)(1) (now repealed).   But it applied only to  offenses\n\ncommitted  after December 31, 1984.   See Publ.  L. 98-596,  \n                                         \n\n10,  98 Stat. 3134,  3138.  Likewise,  18 U.S.C.    3622 (now\n\nrepealed), which specifically required  a sentencing court to\n\nconsider  a  defendant's   \"income,  earning  capacity,   and\n\nfinancial resources\" before imposing  a fine, applied only to\n\noffenses committed after December  31, 1984.  Id.   Under the\n                                                 \n\nlaw applicable to Salazar,  therefore, the district court had\n\n                             -6-\n\nno statutory obligation to consider Salazar's ability to pay.\n\nSee United States v.  Wilfred American Educational Corp., 953\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 717, 719 &amp;  n.1 (1st Cir. 1992) (summarily  dismissing a\n\ncorporation's  claim that imposition of the maximum statutory\n\nfine  was  invalid under  18  U.S.C.    3622(a)  because  the\n\nsentencing court  had not considered  its ability to  pay the\n\nfine  since the conduct for  which the fine  had been imposed\n\nhad occurred before December 31, 1984).\n\n          Indeed,  before the  Criminal Fine  Enforcement Act\n\n(and  thereafter the Sentencing Guidelines) became effective,\n\na  district  court  had  very broad  discretion  in  imposing\n\nsentences as long as they  were within the statutory maximum,\n\nand  sentences within  the statutory  maximum were  virtually\n\nunreviewable on appeal.   See H.R. Rep. No. 906,  98th Cong.,\n                             \n\n2d  Sess., 1984  U.S.C.C.A.N 5433  passim (commenting  on the\n                                         \n\nchanges the  Criminal Fine  Enforcement Act  would make in  a\n\nsentencing  judge's  discretion,  particularly  respecting  a\n\ndefendant's ability to pay);  United States v.

An   appellate  court  will\n\nordinarily not review a  sentence unless it exceeds statutory\n\nlimits or 'is so disproportionate to the offense for which it\n\nwas   imposed  that   it   constitutes   cruel  and   unusual\n\npunishment.'\") (citations omitted), cert.  denied, 111 S.

We would overturn a\n\nsentence  if  the  sentencing   court  had  taken  \"a  rigid,\n\nmechanistic approach\" to  sentencing, and had  not considered\n\n\"the individual  mitigating circumstances\" of  the defendant.\n\nUnited  States v. Bernal, 884 F.2d 1518, 1520 (1st Cir. 1989)\n                        \n\n(citation omitted).           The      presentence     report\n\nindicates that Salazar's fine of $100,000 was well within the\n\napplicable statutory maximum  ($250,000).  Accordingly,  even\n\nif  Salazar had been indigent  at the time  he was sentenced,\n\nthis court would have  no basis for reviewing or  overturning\n\nhis  fine unless  the court  had sentenced  him in  a \"rigid,\n\nmechanistic\" fashion.    The record  before  us gives  us  no\n\nreason to  think that the sentencing  court imposed Salazar's\n\nfine without considering his individual circumstances.  \n\n          Salazar pled  guilty  to cocaine  charges, and  the\n\ngovernment recommended  the maximum  term of twenty  years in\n\nprison  and the maximum fine of $250,000.  The plea agreement\n\n                             -8-\n\nwas non-binding and  gave Salazar  the right to  argue for  a\n\nlesser   sentence.    He  appears  to  have  done  so.    His\n\nsubmissions to  this court  include a  letter written  by him\n\nwhich is dated January  21, 1987, the date he  was sentenced.\n\nIn the letter, Salazar told  the court that he did not  own a\n\nhouse or other property and that the value of his possessions\n\nwas  less   than  $10,000.    Salazar's   presentence  report\n\nindicated  that a year  or two before  sentencing Salazar had\n\nreceived $40,000 for selling  a house which he had  owned for\n\nten years.   The presentence report  confirmed that Salazar's\n\nknown  assets were under  $10,000.  It  reported that Salazar\n\nhad been employed regularly before his arrest and that he had\n\nindicated that  he earned $7/hour when employed.   It further\n\nnoted that drug records showing sales of over $1 million were\n\nfound  in an  apartment  which Salazar  had lived  in shortly\n\nbefore his co-defendants were  arrested and which Salazar had\n\nvacated shortly thereafter, although  the records were not in\n\nSalazar's handwriting.   At  sentencing,  the district  court\n\nimposed  a  fine of  $100,000,  less than  half  the $250,000\n\npermitted by  the statute and recommended  by the government.\n\nAccording to  Salazar, the  district court chose  that amount\n\nbecause Salazar's co-defendants had stated that they had paid\n\nhim $100,000 for cocaine in 1984.  \n\n          From the above, it appears that the court  did take\n\ninto account  the  particular  facts  relating  to  Salazar's\n\n                             -9-\n\nsituation.  It did not impose the maximum fine, but imposed a\n\nfine reflecting  the  amount of  Salazar's illegal  proceeds.\n\nAlthough, obviously, money received  by Salazar in 1984 might\n\nwell have no longer been in his possession as of 1987 when he\n\nwas sentenced, he had  also received $40,000 in 1985  or 1986\n\nfor  the sale  of his  house and  he appeared  to be  able to\n\nobtain employment on a regular basis.  In addition, the court\n\nreasonably might have believed  that the drug records showing\n\nsales  in excess of $1 million found in an apartment recently\n\noccupied  by Salazar,  though  not in  Salazar's handwriting,\n\nreflected Salazar's cocaine receipts. \n\n          In light of  the above, it is  clear that Salazar's\n\nfine did not violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against\n\ncruel and unusual  punishment.  See United  States v.

Adan  Salazar  appeals the  district\n                     \n\ncourt's  denial  of  his request  to  vacate  or provide  for\n\ninstallment payments of a stand committed fine imposed on him\n\nin  1987 after  he pled  guilty to  conspiring to  distribute\n\ncocaine and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine.  We\n\naffirm.\n\n          In a letter,  Salazar asked the  district court  to\n\nvacate his  committed  fine,  or to  permit  its  payment  in\n\ninstallments while he  was on  parole.  He  asked for  relief\n\nfrom the fine because he had been scheduled to be released on\n\nparole, but his parole  had been made contingent on  the fine\n\nbeing paid or \"otherwise  disposed of by law.\"   Salazar told\n\nthe court  that, given his earning  power while incarcerated,\n\nhe  could not pay the fine.  Given his allegedly poor health,\n\nhe also suggested that the fine  \"flirt[ed] on the rim of the\n\nEighth Amendment ban on Cruel or Unusual Punishment.\" \n\n          The district court  treated Salazar's  letter as  a\n\nmotion to  correct a sentence under  Fed. R. Crim. P.  35 and\n\ndenied it as untimely.  The version of Rule 35  applicable to\n\nSalazar, whose offenses were committed in 1984, provided that\n\na  court could correct an \"illegal sentence\" at any time, but\n\nthat  it could  correct  a sentence  \"imposed  in an  illegal\n\nmanner\"  only within 120 days after the date of sentencing or\n\nwithin  120  days  after  the  date  of  the  last  appellate\n\ndisposition upholding the judgment of conviction.  The  court\n\nfound  that Salazar's fine was  not an illegal sentence since\n\nit was not \"ambiguous, contradictory,  incomplete, uncertain,\n\nor unauthorized\",  nor was  it \"in  excess  of the  statutory\n\nmaximum allowable for the  charges [or] in conflict  with any\n\napplicable law.\"    Given Salazar's  allegation that  \"proper\n\nconsideration [had]  not [been] given  to his ability  to pay\n\nthe fine,\"  the court concluded that  Salazar was challenging\n\nthe manner in which  his sentence had been imposed.   Because\n\nhis  challenge had not been brought  within the requisite 120\n\ndays, it denied his request for relief.\n\n          In its decision,  the district  court determined  a\n\npurely  legal question  -- whether  the fine was  an \"illegal\n\nsentence\" which could  be corrected  at any  time under  Rule\n\n35(a).   Given Salazar's argument to the court that presently\n                                                             \n\nhe  could not pay the fine  and the court's position that the\n\nfine had  been within the statutory maximum  and not contrary\n\nto other law  when imposed, we interpret  the court's opinion\n\nto  signify that a fine,  which was legal  when imposed, does\n                                                       \n\nnot become  illegal simply  because the defendant  cannot pay\n\nthe  fine when it comes due.  The only case on point which we\n\nhave found supports the court's conclusion.  In United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

It found that the  defendant's subsequent\n\ninability  to pay  the  fine would  not  render the  fine  an\n\nillegal sentence  for Rule  35 purposes since,  when imposed,\n\n                             -3-\n\nthe   fine  had   been   authorized  by   \"the  judgment   of\n\nconviction.\"1  Id. at 211-12.   \n                  \n\n          Although the district  court's decision has support\n\nin precedent, we would  not confine the analysis to  Rule 35.\n\nWe think that Salazar's request  could also have been treated\n\nas a  28 U.S.C.   2255  motion, which is not  subject to Rule\n\n35's time limitations.   See, e.g., United States v. Santora,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421024\"><a href=\"/opinion/421024/united-states-v-frank-santora-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 (5th Cir. 1983) (\"[m]indful of the liberality\n\naccorded pro se filings, we . . . construe [defendant's] ill-\n               \n\nstyled  Rule  35 pleading  as a  request  for relief  under  \n\n2255\").   Accordingly, we  proceed to resolve  the merits  of\n\nSalazar's claim.  \n\n          Salazar  seems  most concerned  with  the committed\n\nnature of  his fine in light of his impending parole.  To the\n\nextent  he believes that he  will remain in  prison until the\n\nfine is paid, and  that he will never obtain  release because\n\n                    \n\n1.  In Blanton,  the district  court had determined  that the\n              \nfine was an  \"illegal sentence\" which  could be corrected  at\nany time under Rule 35(a).   Once the defendant had lost  the\nmeans  to pay the fine, the court reasoned, it became illegal\nunder  Supreme  Court  law  forbidding the  incarceration  of\npersons  solely because  they could  not pay  their committed\nfine.   But  the  Sixth  Circuit  noted  that  that  law  was\ninapplicable   since   the   defendant   was   not   actually\nincarcerated.   Although  Salazar is  presently incarcerated,\nthe reasoning in the Blanton case applies nonetheless because\n                            \nSalazar  will not  remain incarcerated if  he cannot  pay the\nfine.  If shown to be indigent, Salazar will be released from\nprison.   See 28  U.S.C.    3569 (a  prisoner may  obtain his\n             \ndischarge without  paying his committed fine  by showing that\nhe  is an  indigent and by  taking an  oath to  that effect).\nThus, Salazar's position  is essentially the same as  that of\nthe defendant in Blanton.  \n                        \n\n                             -4-\n\nhis  earning power in prison is too  low to permit him to pay\n\nthe fine  in his lifetime, he  need not worry.   Upon showing\n\nthat he is  indigent, he may obtain his discharge  even if he\n\nhas not paid his fine.  See 28 U.S.C.    3569, supra footnote\n                                                    \n\n1.  \n\n          Salazar  also  appears  to  be  alleging  that  the\n\ncommitted portion of  the fine  was illegal at  the time  the\n\nfine was imposed because  he could not pay  the fine at  that\n\ntime.  As a general matter, courts have long been regarded as\n\nhaving the authority to  impose committed fines.   See United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

The  only\n\nqualification was  that a prisoner could not  be confined for\n\nnot  paying a  fine  if  it  was  his  indigence  alone  that\n\nprevented him  from paying the fine.   See Tate v.

Thus,   Salazar's  alleged\n\nindigency at the  time of sentencing provides  no basis under\n\nthe Constitution for challenging his committed fine.  \n\n            Nor was the district court required by statute to\n\nconsider  Salazar's ability  to pay  the fine  at sentencing.\n\nSalazar's  offenses were committed  before December 31, 1984.\n\nAt  that time, 18 U.S.C.    3565, relating  to the collection\n\nand payment  of  fines  and  penalties,  did  not  require  a\n\nsentencing court  to consider  ability to  pay in  imposing a\n\nfine.   The Criminal  Fine  Enforcement Act  of 1984  amended\n\nsection 3565 to permit the imposition of committed fines only\n\nif the  court found \"by  a preponderance  of the  information\n\nrelied  upon in imposing sentence  that the defendant has the\n\npresent ability to pay a  fine or penalty.\"  See 18  U.S.C.  \n                                                \n\n3565(a)(1) (now repealed).   But it applied only to  offenses\n\ncommitted  after December 31, 1984.   See Publ.  L. 98-596,  \n                                         \n\n10,  98 Stat. 3134,  3138.  Likewise,  18 U.S.C.    3622 (now\n\nrepealed), which specifically required  a sentencing court to\n\nconsider  a  defendant's   \"income,  earning  capacity,   and\n\nfinancial resources\" before imposing  a fine, applied only to\n\noffenses committed after December  31, 1984.  Id.   Under the\n                                                 \n\nlaw applicable to Salazar,  therefore, the district court had\n\n                             -6-\n\nno statutory obligation to consider Salazar's ability to pay.\n\nSee United States v.

The      presentence     report\n\nindicates that Salazar's fine of $100,000 was well within the\n\napplicable statutory maximum  ($250,000).  Accordingly,  even\n\nif  Salazar had been indigent  at the time  he was sentenced,\n\nthis court would have  no basis for reviewing or  overturning\n\nhis  fine unless  the court  had sentenced  him in  a \"rigid,\n\nmechanistic\" fashion.    The record  before  us gives  us  no\n\nreason to  think that the sentencing  court imposed Salazar's\n\nfine without considering his individual circumstances.  \n\n          Salazar pled  guilty  to cocaine  charges, and  the\n\ngovernment recommended  the maximum  term of twenty  years in\n\nprison  and the maximum fine of $250,000.  The plea agreement\n\n                             -8-\n\nwas non-binding and  gave Salazar  the right to  argue for  a\n\nlesser   sentence.    He  appears  to  have  done  so.    His\n\nsubmissions to  this court  include a  letter written  by him\n\nwhich is dated January  21, 1987, the date he  was sentenced.\n\nIn the letter, Salazar told  the court that he did not  own a\n\nhouse or other property and that the value of his possessions\n\nwas  less   than  $10,000.    Salazar's   presentence  report\n\nindicated  that a year  or two before  sentencing Salazar had\n\nreceived $40,000 for selling  a house which he had  owned for\n\nten years.   The presentence report  confirmed that Salazar's\n\nknown  assets were under  $10,000.  It  reported that Salazar\n\nhad been employed regularly before his arrest and that he had\n\nindicated that  he earned $7/hour when employed.   It further\n\nnoted that drug records showing sales of over $1 million were\n\nfound  in an  apartment  which Salazar  had lived  in shortly\n\nbefore his co-defendants were  arrested and which Salazar had\n\nvacated shortly thereafter, although  the records were not in\n\nSalazar's handwriting.   At  sentencing,  the district  court\n\nimposed  a  fine of  $100,000,  less than  half  the $250,000\n\npermitted by  the statute and recommended  by the government.\n\nAccording to  Salazar, the  district court chose  that amount\n\nbecause Salazar's co-defendants had stated that they had paid\n\nhim $100,000 for cocaine in 1984.  \n\n          From the above, it appears that the court  did take\n\ninto account  the  particular  facts  relating  to  Salazar's\n\n                             -9-\n\nsituation.  It did not impose the maximum fine, but imposed a\n\nfine reflecting  the  amount of  Salazar's illegal  proceeds.\n\nAlthough, obviously, money received  by Salazar in 1984 might\n\nwell have no longer been in his possession as of 1987 when he\n\nwas sentenced, he had  also received $40,000 in 1985  or 1986\n\nfor  the sale  of his  house and  he appeared  to be  able to\n\nobtain employment on a regular basis.  In addition, the court\n\nreasonably might have believed  that the drug records showing\n\nsales  in excess of $1 million found in an apartment recently\n\noccupied  by Salazar,  though  not in  Salazar's handwriting,\n\nreflected Salazar's cocaine receipts. \n\n          In light of  the above, it is  clear that Salazar's\n\nfine did not violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against\n\ncruel and unusual  punishment.
