Menna  is dischargeable in  bankruptcy.  The  bankruptcy court\n\nruled against Balfour, the district court upheld the  ruling, and\n\nwe now affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Menna retained Balfour to sell his business.  Following\n\nthe sale, the buyers, Robert and Brenda Pawloski, brought a state\n\ncourt  action against Menna  and Balfour for  fraud and negligent\n\nmisrepresentation,   respectively,   and   Balfour  cross-claimed\n\nagainst  Menna for  equitable indemnification.    The jury  found\n\nMenna  and Balfour jointly  and severally liable  and awarded the\n\nPawloskis  $128,500 in  compensatory damages.    The state  court\n\nentered   judgment   for   Balfour   on   its   cross-claim   for\n\nindemnification against  Menna because Balfour's  mere negligence\n\nmade it  less culpable than  Menna, whose conduct had  been found\n\nfraudulent.   The Pawloskis  thereafter  recovered $110,000  from\n\nBalfour on their judgment.\n\n          After  Menna  filed  a voluntary  chapter  7  petition,\n\nBalfour commenced an  adversary proceeding against Menna  to have\n\nits $110,000 indemnification claim against Menna declared nondis-\n\nchargeable,  pursuant to  Bankruptcy  Code    523(a)(2)(A)  (debt\n\n                                2\n\n\"for money . . .  to the extent obtained by  . . . actual fraud\")\n\nand  523(a)(6) (debt  \"for  willful and  malicious injury  by the\n\ndebtor  to another entity\"),  11 U.S.C.    523  (a)(2)(A), (a)(6)\n\n(1993).  On the cross-motions for summary judgment the bankruptcy\n\ncourt  ruled that Balfour's  indemnification claim  is discharge-\n\nable, see Century 21 Balfour Real Estate v. Menna (In re  Menna),\n                                                               \n\n152  B.R.  5, 6  (Bankr. D.

Balfour concedes, however, that  it presented\n\nno competent evidence that Menna either acted with malice toward,\n                                                                \n\nor intended to defraud, Balfour.2  \n                               \n\n          Balfour principally complains that the bankruptcy court\n\nfailed  to  recognize that  section  523(a)  does not  require  a\n\nshowing that the  claimant was the direct or  immediate target of\n                                                       \n\nthe  debtor's fraudulent intent or malicious conduct.  Therefore,\n\nit  argues, since Menna  exposed both Balfour  (Menna's equitable\n                                     \n\nindemnitee) and  the Pawloskis  to the  $128,500 loss,  Balfour's\n\nclaim  for  equitable  indemnification is  one  \"for  money . . .\n                                                    \n\nobtained  by [the  debtor's] actual  fraud,\" or \"for  willful and\n                                                    \n\nmalicious  injury by  the debtor  to  another entity.\"   Were  it\n\notherwise, Balfour says, dishonest debtors like Menna who embroil\n\nless  culpable third  parties like  Balfour  in their  fraudulent\n\nschemes  could  easily  subvert the  Code's  central  strategy of\n\nrestricting the  \"fresh start\"  discharge to  \"honest but  unfor-\n                                                     \n\ntunate\" debtors.

The\n                                                          \ndistrict court correctly  noted that the  complaint made no  such\nallegation, nor  did Balfour assert  such an argument  before the\nbankruptcy court.

First, we underscore  that\n\nsection 523(a)  does not  employ the  terms adopted  in Balfour's\n\nparaphrase     \"debt based upon\"     nor does the  statutory lan-\n\nguage remotely  suggest that nondischargeability attaches  to any\n\nclaim  other than  one  which arises  as a  direct result  of the\n\ndebtor's  misrepresentation or malice.3   Moreover, Balfour cites\n\nno case in which it has been argued, let alone decided,  that the\n\nnonfraud-based  indemnification claim  of an entity  whose negli-\n\ngence  has combined  with the  fraud of  its joint  tortfeasor to\n\ncause injury  to a third  party is nondischargeable in  the bank-\n\n                    \n\n     3The parties  devote considerable attention  to whether both\nthe   Balfour  and the  Pawloski  \"claims\" derive  from the  same\n                                                                 \n\"debt,\"  or  from two  distinct  \"debts.\"   However,  neither the\n                               \nBankruptcy  Code's  austere  definitions,  see  Bankruptcy   Code\n                                              \n  101(11),  11  U.S.C.    101(11)  (\"debt\"  is  \"liability  on  a\nclaim\"),    101(4)(A), 11 U.S.C.   101(4)(A) (\"claim\" is \"a right\nto payment, whether  or not such right is  reduced to judgment\"),\nnor  the broad  pronouncements on  the common  law principles  of\nequitable  indemnification,  see  Northeast Bank  of  Lewiston  &amp;\n                                                                 \nAuburn v. Murphy, 512 A.2d 344 (Me. 1986), afford helpful insight\n                \ninto the  substantive concerns presently  at issue.  We  will not\nreverse a bankruptcy court's grant of discharge relief except for\nreasons both \"real and substantial.\"  See In re Burgess, 955 F.2d\n                                                       \nat 137.\n\n                                6\n\nruptcy  of the  fraudulent tortfeasor.4   Given  the strict  con-\n\nstruction afforded all dischargeability exceptions under  section\n\n523(a), see In re Burgess, 955 F.2d at 137, we have been provided\n                         \n\nwith  neither authority nor  reason to extend  the statutory lan-\n\nguage as urged by Balfour.\n\n          Second,  Balfour  wrongly presumes  that  exceptions to\n\ndischarge  serve only  to  penalize  the debtor.    Rather, as  a\n\nfunction  of its  essentially equitable  nature,  a nondischarge-\n\nability determination  under section 523(a) is  designed concomi-\n\ntantly to protect the inculpable creditor, cf.

Following the sale, the buyers, Robert and Brenda Pawloski, brought a state court action against Menna and Balfour for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, respectively, and Balfour cross-claimed against Menna for equitable indemnification.  The jury found Menna and Balfour jointly and severally liable and awarded the Pawloskis $128,500 in compensatory damages.  The state court entered judgment for Balfour on its cross-claim for indemnification against Menna because Balfour's mere negligence made it less culpable than Menna, whose conduct had been found fraudulent.

Although all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party, \"[a]s to any essential factual element of its claim on which the nonmovant would bear the burden of proof at trial, its failure to come forward with sufficient evidence to generate a trialworthy issue warrants summary judgment to the moving party.\"  Ralar Distribs., Inc. v.

Section 523(a)(2)(A) excepts from discharge \"any debt ... for money, property, [or] services ... to the extent obtained by false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.\"   Bankruptcy Code Sec. 523(a)(2)(A), 11 U.S.C.

Sec. 523(a)(6), 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(6).  The complaint alleges that Balfour's indemnification claim is \"based upon [Menna's] malicious conduct toward the Pawloskis,\" as evidenced by the Pawloskis' $25,000 punitive damages verdict against Menna.  (Emphasis added.)   Balfour concedes, however, that it presented no competent evidence that Menna either acted with malice toward, or intended to defraud, Balfour.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Balfour principally complains that the bankruptcy court failed to recognize that section 523(a) does not require a showing that the claimant was the direct or immediate target of the debtor's fraudulent intent or malicious conduct.  Therefore, it argues, since Menna exposed both Balfour (Menna's equitable indemnitee) and the Pawloskis to the $128,500 loss, Balfour's claim for equitable indemnification is one \"for money ... obtained by [the debtor's] actual fraud,\" or \"for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity.\"   Were it otherwise, Balfour says, dishonest debtors like Menna who embroil less culpable third parties like Balfour in their fraudulent schemes could easily subvert the Code's central strategy of restricting the \"fresh start\" discharge to \"honest but unfortunate\" debtors.

The Travelers Ins. Co. v. Cambridge Meridian Group, Inc.  (In re Erin Food Servs., Inc.), 980 F.2d 792, 799 (1st Cir.1992).  First, we underscore that section 523(a) does not employ the terms adopted in Balfour's paraphrase--\"debt based upon\"--nor does the statutory language remotely suggest that nondischargeability attaches to any claim other than one which arises as a direct result of the debtor's misrepresentation or malice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Moreover, Balfour cites no case in which it has been argued, let alone decided, that the nonfraud-based indemnification claim of an entity whose negligence has combined with the fraud of its joint tortfeasor to cause injury to a third party is nondischargeable in the bankruptcy of the fraudulent tortfeasor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Given the strict construction afforded all dischargeability exceptions under section 523(a), see In re Burgess, 955 F.2d at 137, we have been provided with neither authority nor reason to extend the statutory language as urged by Balfour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Balfour wrongly presumes that exceptions to discharge serve only to penalize the debtor.  Rather, as a function of its essentially equitable nature, a nondischargeability determination under section 523(a) is designed concomitantly to protect the inculpable creditor, cf. H.R.Rep. No. 595,  supra, at 130, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6091 (\"The premise of [Sec. 523(a)(2)(B) ] is that a creditor that extended credit based on misinformation or fraudulent information transmitted by the debtor should be protected.\")  (emphasis added).

If section 523(a)(2) had been intended simply to deter all bad faith conduct by the debtor irrespective of its effect upon the particular creditor, as Balfour's argument impliedly assumes, there would have been no need to condition the creditor's right to a nondischargeability ruling on a showing of reasonable reliance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Even assuming arguendo that an equitable indemnitee's vicarious injury might satisfy the first constituent element of the \"fraud\" test under section 523(a)(2), thereby generally establishing bad faith or misconduct on the part of the debtor, Balfour nonetheless must make the \"reasonable reliance\" showing required under section Sec. 523(a)(2)--that it reasonably and detrimentally relied on Menna's misrepresentations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

Yet it presented no evidence whatever from which the bankruptcy court could have determined whether Balfour actually or reasonably relied on Menna's misrepresentations when it communicated the unspecified misinformation about the pending sale to the Pawloskis.  Indeed, the record is even devoid of evidence of the circumstances surrounding the November 1987 sale transaction, the nature, duration or history of the Menna-Balfour business relationship, or whether Balfour might have detected or thwarted Menna's misrepresentations by \"minimal investigation.\"   See BancBoston Mortgage Corp. v.

Under Maine law, the Pawloskis' negligent misrepresentation claim against Balfour required proof that, inter alia:  (1) Balfour supplied information to the Pawloskis as \"guidance\" in their business transaction, (2) the Pawloskis justifiably relied on the information;  and (3) Balfour failed to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\"  Jordan-Milton Mach., Inc. v.

Even so, Balfour gains nothing.  If the two legal standards do diverge, as Balfour argues, the two state court judgments simply are not probative of Balfour's \"reasonable reliance,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and Balfour had the burden of producing some competent evidence from which the bankruptcy court could find reasonable reliance.

The jury found Menna and Balfour jointly and severally liable and awarded the Pawloskis $128,500 in compensatory damages.

Therefore, it argues, since Menna exposed both Balfour (Menna's equitable indemnitee) and the Pawloskis to the $128,500 loss, Balfour's claim for equitable indemnification is one \"for money ... obtained by [the debtor's] actual fraud,\" or \"for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity.\"   Were it otherwise, Balfour says, dishonest debtors like Menna who embroil less culpable third parties like Balfour in their fraudulent schemes could easily subvert the Code's central strategy of restricting the \"fresh start\" discharge to \"honest but unfortunate\" debtors.

First, we underscore that section 523(a) does not employ the terms adopted in Balfour's paraphrase--\"debt based upon\"--nor does the statutory language remotely suggest that nondischargeability attaches to any claim other than one which arises as a direct result of the debtor's misrepresentation or malice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Moreover, Balfour cites no case in which it has been argued, let alone decided, that the nonfraud-based indemnification claim of an entity whose negligence has combined with the fraud of its joint tortfeasor to cause injury to a third party is nondischargeable in the bankruptcy of the fraudulent tortfeasor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Given the strict construction afforded all dischargeability exceptions under section 523(a), see In re Burgess, 955 F.2d at 137, we have been provided with neither authority nor reason to extend the statutory language as urged by Balfour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Balfour wrongly presumes that exceptions to discharge serve only to penalize the debtor.

No. 595,  supra, at 130, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6091 (\"The premise of [Sec. 523(a)(2)(B) ] is that a creditor that extended credit based on misinformation or fraudulent information transmitted by the debtor should be protected.\")  (emphasis added).

If section 523(a)(2) had been intended simply to deter all bad faith conduct by the debtor irrespective of its effect upon the particular creditor, as Balfour's argument impliedly assumes, there would have been no need to condition the creditor's right to a nondischargeability ruling on a showing of reasonable reliance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Even assuming arguendo that an equitable indemnitee's vicarious injury might satisfy the first constituent element of the \"fraud\" test under section 523(a)(2), thereby generally establishing bad faith or misconduct on the part of the debtor, Balfour nonetheless must make the \"reasonable reliance\" showing required under section Sec. 523(a)(2)--that it reasonably and detrimentally relied on Menna's misrepresentations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

Even so, Balfour gains nothing.  If the two legal standards do diverge, as Balfour argues, the two state court judgments simply are not probative of Balfour's \"reasonable reliance,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and Balfour had the burden of producing some competent evidence from which the bankruptcy court could find reasonable reliance.  On the other hand, if the standards do not diverge, collateral estoppel barred Balfour's present contention as a matter of law.
