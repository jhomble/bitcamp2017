It is  common wisdom  that the\n          SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\n                               \n\npast  is  prologue, foreshadowing  the  future.   When  convicted\n\ncriminals rise to  be sentenced  in a federal  court, the  career\n\noffender guideline, U.S.S.G.  4B1.1,  imbues that aphorism with a\n\nspecial  meaning.1  In such  a setting, however,  all past crimes\n\nare  not regarded  as  equal; the  guideline  is fueled  only  by\n\nprevious felony convictions for crimes of violence and controlled\n\nsubstance offenses.  See id. \n                            \n\n          The case  before us requires that  we determine whether\n\nparticular  convictions  attributable  to   certain  racketeering\n\nactivities constitute  crimes of  violence within the  purview of\n\nthis  guideline.  Because we  agree with the  district court that\n\nthey do not, we affirm the sentence imposed below.\n\n                                I.\n                                  \n\n                        Travel of the Case\n                                          \n\n          On May  17, 1993,  defendant-appellee Howard  T. Winter\n\npleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine with\n\nintent  to distribute, see 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1), and five counts\n                          \n\nof aiding  and abetting the same offense, see 18 U.S.C.   2.  The\n                                             \n\ndistrict court, which had ruled out the career offender guideline\n\nduring   a   special   pre-plea  hearing,   imposed   a  ten-year\n\nincarcerative sentence.   It  is undisputed  that, had the  court\n\n                    \n\n     1The November 1992 edition of the guidelines applies in this\ncase.   See United States  v. Harotunian, 920  F.2d 1040, 1041-42\n                                        \n(1st  Cir. 1990) (explaining that the guidelines in effect at the\ntime of  sentencing control  unless ex post  facto considerations\nprohibit  their use).  Hence,  all references herein  are to that\nedition.\n\n                                2\n\nemployed the  career offender guideline, a  significantly greater\n\nsentence would have been mandated.\n\n          The    government    appeals    pursuant     to    18  \n\nU.S.C.   3742(b)(2).\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                           The Problem\n                                      \n\n          Under the sentencing guidelines, career offender status\n\nattaches if (1) the defendant achieved the age of majority before\n\ncommitting  the offense  of  conviction, (2)  that  offense is  a\n\nfelony which can  itself be  characterized as either  a crime  of\n\nviolence or controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant's\n\ncriminal  history   reflects  a  minimum  of   two  prior  felony\n\nconvictions  (known colloquially  as  \"predicate  offenses\")  for\n\neither  crimes  of  violence   or  crimes  involving   controlled\n\nsubstances.    See  U.S.S.G.  4B1.1.    In  this  case, defendant\n                  \n\nconcedes that most   but not all   of these preconditions obtain:\n\nhe committed  the offense  of conviction more  than four  decades\n\nafter turning  eighteen; that  offense is a  controlled substance\n\noffense; and he labors under the burden of a prior conviction for\n\nextortion    a crime that is considered  a crime of violence, see\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. DeLuca,     F.3d     ,     (1st Cir. 1994)  [No.\n                       \n\n93-1773,  slip  op.  at  3-6]; see  also  U.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1)(ii)\n                                        \n\n(enumerating certain crimes of  violence and listing extortion as\n\none of them).\n\n          The nub of the case is  the defendant's insistence that\n\nhis  prior criminal history  does not include  a second predicate\n\n                                3\n\noffense.    In  the  court  below,  the  government  nominated  a\n\ncandidate  to fill out the slate   a racketeering indictment that\n\nresulted  in defendant's conviction in 1979,  after trial, for an\n\namalgam  of offenses, namely,  engaging in  racketeering activity\n\n(horse race  fixing),  see 18  U.S.C.    1962(c),  conspiracy  to\n                          \n\nengage in such activity, see 18 U.S.C.   1962(d), sports bribery,\n                            \n\nsee  18 U.S.C.    224, and  travel in aid  of racketeering (horse\n   \n\nrace fixing),  see 18 U.S.C.   1952(a).2  The lower court did not\n                  \n\nthink the  government's candidate  qualified for election  to the\n\n\"crime of violence\" ranks, notwithstanding the government's claim\n\nthat strong-arm  tactics were  standard fare in  the racketeering\n\nand racketeering-related  activities over which  Winter presided.\n\nConsequently, the  court  decreed  that, for  want  of  a  second\n\npredicate offense, the career offender guideline did not pertain.\n\n          The  instant appeal  turns  on  the appropriateness  of\n\ncategorizing at  least one  of the  1979 offenses  as a  crime of\n\nviolence.   Whether a conviction  for a particular  type of crime\n\nqualifies  as  a  predicate   offense  presents  a  purely  legal\n\nquestion,  sparking  de novo  review.   See  United States  v. De\n                                                                 \n\nJesus,  984 F.2d  21, 23 n.4  (1st Cir.  1993); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nFiore, 983  F.2d 1, 2 (1st  Cir. 1992), cert. denied,  113 S.

We  emulate their example.  And\nwe sometimes refer to these several crimes, collectively, as \"the\n1979 offenses.\"\n\n                                4\n\n                        Crimes of Violence\n                                          \n\n          To constitute  a crime of  violence, a felony  must fit\n\ninto  one of several  pigeonholes.   To be  specific, a  crime of\n\nviolence  is any state or federal offense punishable by more than\n\none year in prison that (1) \"has as an element the use, attempted\n\nuse,  or threatened use of  physical force against  the person of\n\nanother,\"  U.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1)(i), or (2) reposes on a short list\n\nof specially enumerated  crimes such as \"burglary of  a dwelling,\n\narson, or  extortion,\" U.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1)(ii), or  (3) \"involves\n\nuse of explosives,\" id., or (4) \"otherwise involves conduct  that\n                       \n\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\"\n\nid.  \n   \n\n          Determining  whether a previous conviction represents a\n\ncrime  of violence  necessitates a  formal  categorical approach.\n\nSee DeLuca,     F.3d  at     [slip op. at 5]; De  Jesus, 984 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 23; United States v.

See, e.g., De Jesus, 984 F.2d at\n                                                    \n24 n.6; Bell, 966 F.2d at 704.\n            \n\n                                5\n\ninquiry  into  the details  of  the  defendant's actual  criminal\n\nconduct.

For\n                                         \n\nexample,  if the statutory  description is inscrutable,  or if it\n\nblankets both  violent and non-violent  crimes, a court  may peek\n\nbeneath  the coverlet.  See,  e.g., United States  v. Harris, 965\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1234, 1235  (1st Cir. 1992) (employing  similar exception in\n\nan ACCA case); see also Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602-03.\n                              \n\n          These  principles inform  our treatment of  the instant\n\ncase.  Here, the first three avenues to dubbing the 1979 offenses\n\ncrimes of violence are  dead ends; the government concedes    as,\n\nindeed, it must   that no count of conviction was for a felony of\n\nwhich physical  force is an  element, or for  a felony  listed by\n\nname  in the career offender guideline, or for a felony involving\n\nthe  use of  explosives.   Thus, the  issue before  us hinges  on\n\nwhether  any  of the  counts  of  conviction, considered  from  a\n\ncategorical standpoint,  can be  said to \"involve[]  conduct that\n\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1)(ii);  see  also  U.S.S.G.    4B1.2,  comment.\n                                   \n\nn.2(B).\n\n                               IV.\n                                  \n\n                             Analysis\n                                     \n\n                                6\n\n                                A.\n                                  \n\n          The  label \"racketeering,\" though  pejorative, does not\n\nshed much light  on whether  the activity in  question poses  (or\n\nfails  to pose) a serious potential risk of violence.  After all,\n\nracketeering  comes in many shapes  and sizes, and  covers a wide\n\nrange of  activities.   Those activities are  uniformly nefarious\n\nand  almost  invariably  nasty    but  they  are not  necessarily\n\nviolent.4  One is reminded of  the label \"conspiracy,\" a label so\n\nencompassing that it  \"says next to nothing  about the underlying\n\nnature  of  the crime,\"  and, therefore,  gives  a court  no real\n\ninsight  into  whether a  conviction  bearing  the label  can  be\n\nclassified as a crime of violence.  Fiore, 983 F.2d  at 3.  Since\n                                         \n\nthe  statutory language  describing  racketeering,  taken  alone,\n\ntells us so  little, we  can only conclude  that convictions  for\n\nracketeering  sometimes will  constitute  predicate offenses  and\n\nsometimes will  not.  It  follows, a  fortiori, that the  same is\n                                              \n\ntrue   vis-a-vis   convictions  for   conspiracy  to   engage  in\n\nracketeering.\n\n          Because  crimes of  this  androgynous sort,  not unlike\n\nchameleons, \"will  necessarily take  on  the characteristics  and\n\ncoloration  of  [their]  environment,\"  id.  (discussing  general\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n     4The  RICO statute makes it unlawful for a person to conduct\nthe  affairs  of  any enterprise  affecting  interstate  commerce\n\"through  a pattern  of  racketeering activity  or collection  of\nunlawful debt,\" 18 U.S.C.    1962(c), or to conspire to that end,\n18  U.S.C.   1962(d).  The statute defines the term \"racketeering\nactivity\"  broadly, see 18 U.S.C.   1961(1), with the result that\n                       \nthe  term includes  activities ranging  from murder  (perhaps the\nparadigmatic  crime of violence) to wire fraud (a good example of\na crime that has never been considered a crime of violence).\n\n                                7\n\nconspiracy),  some  exploration  of   that  environment  must  be\n\nundertaken.  Yet, a caveat is in order:  even where, as here, the\n\ncategory limned in the statute is an inexact  semantic construct,\n\nwarranting further inquiry, the task of  classification continues\n\nto demand a categorical as opposed to  a fact-sensitive analysis.\n\nThis  means  that if  previous  convictions  for racketeering  or\n\nracketeering  conspiracy  are  in   issue,  a  court  seeking  to\n\nascertain  the  appropriateness  of  predicate  offense treatment\n\nunder Taylor principles must ask categorically oriented questions\n            \n\nsuch  as:   \"Racketeering by what  means?\" \"Racketeering  to what\n\nend?\"  And  in answering  these questions, the  court should  not\n\nplunge into the details of a particular defendant's conduct, but,\n\nrather,  again in  fidelity to  Taylor principles,  should merely\n                                      \n\nassess the  nature  and object  of the  racketeering activity  as\n\ndescribed  in   the  indictment  and  fleshed  out  in  the  jury\n\ninstructions.  See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602; De Jesus, 984 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n23 n.5.\n\n          This  methodology  makes  good  sense,  for  it  cabins\n\nfurther inquiry in keeping with its categorical roots, permitting\n\nthe court to take a predetermined sample of the earlier  case and\n\nevaluate its  composition without at  the same time  inviting the\n\njudicial  equivalent   of  an  archaeological  dig.     We  turn,\n\ntherefore,  to the charging  papers and jury  instructions in the\n\n1979  case to ascertain the nature and object of the racketeering\n\n                                8\n\nactivity.5\n\n                                B.\n                                  \n\n          The  earlier  indictment  identified the  \"racketeering\n\nactivity\"  with which Winter was  charged as \"horse race fixing,\"\n\nand  described the  offenses  comprising the  alleged pattern  of\n\nracketeering activity as sports bribery, see 18 U.S.C.   224, and\n                                            \n\ntravel in  aid of racketeering, see 18 U.S.C.   1952(a)(3).  This\n                                   \n\nformat creates  two possible  pathways to finding  that the  1979\n\noffenses are crimes of violence.  We explore each of them.\n\n          1.   Sports Bribery.    Sports bribery  is a  discrete,\n          1.   Sports Bribery.\n                             \n\nmeaningful  rubric, itself  susceptible of  categorical analysis;\n\ntherefore,  we  need look  no further  than  the language  of the\n\nstatute.6   Given  that wording,  it is  certainly  possible that\n                                                            \n\nsports bribery can bring violence into play   but that is not the\n\ncritical determinant.   A  categorical approach is  not concerned\n\nwith testing either the outer limits of statutory language or the\n\nmyriad  of possibilities  girdled  by that  language; instead,  a\n\ncategorical approach is concerned with  the usual type of conduct\n\nthat the statute  purposes to proscribe.  See De  Jesus, 984 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 24.   Thus, a court  asked to determine whether  an offense is\n\n(or  is  not) a  crime  of  violence within  the  meaning of  the\n\n                    \n\n     5This analysis does double duty in the  present case because\nit  also serves  to probe the  status of the  remaining counts of\nconviction as crimes of violence vel non.\n                                        \n\n     6The  relevant statute  criminalizes interstate  schemes \"to\ninfluence, in  any way, by  bribery, any  sporting contest,  with\nknowledge that  the  purpose of  [the  particular] scheme  is  to\ninfluence by bribery that contest . . . .\"  18 U.S.C.   224(a).\n\n                                9\n\n\"otherwise\"  clause of  the career  offender guideline,  U.S.S.G.\n\n 4B1.2(1)(ii), must  focus on \"the  degree of risk,  expressed in\n\nterms  of the probability of physical harm presented by the mine-\n\nrun of conduct that  falls within the heartland of  the statute.\"\n\nDe Jesus, 984 F.2d at 24.\n        \n\n          Under this  standard, the government's  argument cannot\n\nprosper.  Sports bribery, in general,  simply lacks the \"inherent\n                                    \n\nrisk  of violent outbreak\" necessary to justify classifying it as\n\na crime of  violence.  Id. at  25; see also Fiore, 983  F.2d at 4\n                                                 \n\n(to  come within  the crime  of violence  ambit, a  crime, viewed\n\ngenerically,  must  pose  a  substantial  potential for  episodic\n\nviolence); Doe, 960 F.2d at 224-25 (finding \"felon-in-possession\"\n              \n\nconvictions  not  to qualify  as  predicate  offenses under  ACCA\n\nbecause such convictions do not usually involve violent conduct).\n\nSince there  is no  sound basis  for  saying that  violence is  a\n\nnormal, usual,  or customary  concomitant of sports  bribery, the\n\ncrime is not a crime of violence.\n\n          2.    Travel  in  Aid of  Racketeering.    The  statute\n          2.    Travel  in  Aid of  Racketeering.\n                                                \n\nunderlying  the Travel  Act counts  outlaws travel  in interstate\n\ncommerce with intent to -\n\n          (1) distribute  the proceeds of  any unlawful\n          activity; or\n\n          (2) commit  any crime of  violence to further\n          any unlawful activity; or\n\n          (3)  otherwise  promote,  manage,  establish,\n          carry   on,   or  facilitate   the  promotion\n          management, establishment, or carrying on, of\n          any unlawful activity, . . . .\n\n                                10\n\n18  U.S.C.    1952(a).7   Based on  this statute,  the government\n\nmaintains that,  because the Travel Act  encompasses both violent\n\nand non-violent offenses, the court below should have delved into\n\ndefendant's   actual  conduct  to   determine  if   his  offenses\n\nconstituted crimes of violence. We do not agree.\n\n          To be sure, the  government is correct in stating  that\n\nthe Travel Act  reaches violent as  well as non-violent  conduct.\n\nCompare  id.    1952(a)(2)  (proscribing  travel  with intent  to\n            \n\n\"commit any  crime   of   violence  to   further   any   unlawful\n\nactivity\")  with  id.    1952(a)(1),(3) (proscribing  generically\n                     \n\nnon-violent conduct).  But the statute's breadth does not give an\n\ninquiring court license  to roam  at will through  the record  of\n\neach individual case.  Rather, Taylor demands that a court poised\n                                     \n\nat  such  a crossroads  consult a  limited  array of  materials  \n\nprincipally the indictment and jury instructions   in determining\n\nif the  offense can be classified  as a crime of  violence.8  See\n                                                                 \n\nTaylor, 495  U.S. at 602-03;  see also Harris, 964  F.2d at 1235;\n                                             \n\nDoe, 960 F.2d at 224-25.\n   \n\n                    \n\n     7For  purposes  of  the   Travel  Act,  the  term  \"unlawful\nactivity\" is defined to include a salmagundi of criminal conduct,\nranging from the violent (e.g., arson)  to the non-violent (e.g.,\n                                                                \nviolation of state liquor laws).  See 18 U.S.C.   1952(b)(i)(1) -\n                                     \n(3).     Bribery  is   specifically  enumerated.     See  id.    \n                                                             \n1952(b)(i)(2).\n\n     8Although  we   have  occasionally  approved  resort   to  a\npresentence  report in this connection,  we have done  so only in\ncases  in which  the defendant  entered a  guilty plea,  with the\nresult that no jury instructions were available for retrospective\nreview.  See, e.g., Harris, 964 F.2d at 1235-36; United States v.\n                                                              \nBregnard, 951 F.2d 457, 459-60 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112\n                                                            \nS. Ct.  2939 (1992).  Because a jury convicted Winter on the 1979\noffenses after a full trial, the exception is inapposite here.\n\n                                11\n\n          In  this instance,  the  permitted  review  establishes\n\nthat, under  applicable Taylor principles, the  Travel Act counts\n                              \n\ndo  not qualify  as crimes  of violence.9   Those  counts charged\n\nWinter  with  commissioning travel  to  assist  in \"effecting  by\n\nbribery the outcome of . . . horse races.\"  Although fixing horse\n\nraces is antisocial conduct that may on occasion utilize violence\n\nas a tool, it does not carry with it an inherent risk  of violent\n\noutbreak  sufficient  to  merit  classification  as  a  crime  of\n\nviolence.   In  other  words, because  violence  is not  a  usual\n                                                                 \n\naccouterment of horse race fixing, the degree of risk,  expressed\n\nin terms of the probability of physical harm, associated with the\n\nmine-run  of conduct that comprises the  heartland of the statute\n\nis  relatively  low.   And because  that  is so,  the \"otherwise\"\n\nclause in  the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G.  4B1.2(1)(ii),\n\ndoes not apply.\n\n          There  is also a second  reason why the  two Travel Act\n\ncounts are  poor candidates for inclusion  as predicate offenses.\n\nNeither of these  counts invoked the Travel  Act generally; their\n\nlanguage  focused  single-mindedly on  clause  (3),  18 U.S.C.   \n\n1952(a)(3),  a subsection  of  the Travel  Act that  criminalizes\n\n                    \n\n     9Counts  22 and 23 of  the indictment, which  form the basis\nfor  the government's  contention,  in terms  charge that  Winter\nviolated the  Travel Act on  two different dates  in that  he and\nanother  caused  one  Anthony  Ciulla  \"willfully  to  travel  in\ninterstate  commerce . . .  said defendants intending to promote,\nmanage,  establish, carry  on and  facilitate .  . .  an unlawful\nactivity, being bribery in  violation of Pennsylvania Cons. Stat.\nAnn. Section 4109, and did thereafter perform, attempt to perform\nand cause  acts  to  promote,  manage, establish,  carry  on  and\nfacilitate  . .  . an  unlawful activity, to  wit:   affecting by\nbribery the outcome of pari-mutuel thoroughbred horse races.\"\n\n                                12\n\npredominantly  non-violent conduct,  rather than  clause (2),  18\n\nU.S.C.   1952(a)(2), a subsection that criminalizes predominantly\n\nviolent conduct.  To convict on the Travel Act counts, therefore,\n\nthe jury was required only to find that Winter used bribes to rig\n\nhorse races  and caused Ciulla to  travel in aid of  the scheme. \n\nThe charges did not  require a finding that the  offense involved\n\nviolence in any way, shape, or form.\n\n          The jury  instructions bear  this out; in  briefing the\n\njurors  on the Travel Act  counts, the trial  judge defined those\n\ncounts  in  the vernacular  of  section  1952(a)(3), abjured  any\n\nsuggestion that  the  counts implicated  section 1952(a)(2),  and\n\nidentified  bribery as the unlawful activity  to which the travel\n\nwas  directed.   Because  the  defendant  was  charged  with  and\n\nconvicted  of violating the  Travel Act under  the statute's non-\n\nviolent  alternative, the  Travel  Act counts  did  not serve  to\n\ntransmogrify the 1979 offenses into crimes of violence.\n\n          3.    The Pennsylvania  Statute.    The government  has\n          3.    The Pennsylvania  Statute.\n                                         \n\nanother string to its bow.  Because the Travel Act counts mention\n\nthe  violation of a Pennsylvania  statute, see supra  note 9, and\n                                                    \n\nthat statute includes  violent as well as  non-violent methods of\n\nperpetrating the  specified crime,10 the  government hypothesizes\n\nthat we can explore whether Winter actually conducted the bribery\n\n                    \n\n     10In pertinent  part, the state statute  outlaws the rigging\nof publicly exhibited contests  in circumstances wherein a person\n\"confers .  . . any benefit  upon, or threatens any  injury to, a\nparticipant, official or other person associated with the contest\nor exhibition; or (2) tampers with any person, animal, or thing.\"\n18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann.   4109(a).\n\n                                13\n\nscheme in a brutal manner.\n\n          This reasoning is specious.  Winter was neither charged\n\nwith, nor  convicted of, violating the  Pennsylvania statute; and\n\nthe indictment  does not  embrace the  language of that  statute.\n\nTaylor and its  progeny in no way suggest that  a reviewing court\n      \n\nshould  investigate  conduct   ranging  outside  the   counts  of\n\nconviction for  purposes of  determining career offender  status.\n\nIndeed,  the case law teaches  the opposite lesson.   See Taylor,\n                                                                \n\n495 U.S. at 602; Doe, 960  F.2d at 224; United States v. Leavitt,\n                                                                \n\n925 F.2d 516, 517-18  (1st Cir. 1991); see also  U.S.S.G.  4B1.2,\n                                               \n\ncomment.  n.2(B)  (explaining  that  \"the conduct  of  which  the\n\ndefendant was convicted is the focus of inquiry\").\n\n          Moreover,  although the Pennsylvania statute includes a\n\nviolent  method of horse  race fixing  among the  several methods\n\nidentified therein,  the state statute  is mentioned only  in the\n\nTravel Act  counts.   In turn,  those counts,  as charged  in the\n                                                                 \n\nindictment, by  their very  wording exclude that  violent method,\n          \n\nfor  they  are  worded  exclusively in  terms  of  a  non-violent\n\nalternative,  subsection (a)(3)  of the Travel  Act, 18  U.S.C.  \n\n1952(a)(3).    Thus,  the  passing mention  of  the  Pennsylvania\n\nbribery  statute is of no consequence  anent the applicability of\n\nthe career offender guideline.\n\n                                V.\n                                  \n\n                            Conclusion\n                                      \n\n          Categorically  speaking,  racketeering,  conspiracy  to\n\ncommit racketeering,  travel in  aid of racketeering,  and sports\n\n                                14\n\nbribery all fail, in  the circumstances of this case,  to qualify\n\nas  crimes  of  violence  under the  career  offender  guideline,\n\nU.S.S.G.  4B1.1.   Hence, the government's  claim that assaultive\n\nbehavior  was used to  advance Winter's  racketeering activities,\n\neven  if  true, is  beside the  point.   We  need go  no further:\n\nalthough  Winter,  as  the  government  asserts,  may  well  have\n\ndemonstrated a penchant for  violence, he could not appropriately\n\nhave been sentenced as a career offender.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                15\n",

When convicted criminals rise to be sentenced in a federal court, the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G.

Sec. 2.  The district court, which had ruled out the career offender guideline during a special pre-plea hearing, imposed a ten-year incarcerative sentence.

See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1.  In this case, defendant concedes that most--but not all--of these preconditions obtain:  he committed the offense of conviction more than four decades after turning eighteen;  that offense is a controlled substance offense;  and he labors under the burden of a prior conviction for extortion--a crime that is considered a crime of violence, see United States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 7-9 (1st Cir.1994);  see also U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii) (enumerating certain crimes of violence and listing extortion as one of them).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nub of the case is the defendant's insistence that his prior criminal history does not include a second predicate offense.  In the court below, the government nominated a candidate to fill out the slate--a racketeering indictment that resulted in defendant's conviction in 1979, after trial, for an amalgam of offenses, namely, engaging in racketeering activity (horse race fixing), see 18 U.S.C.

Whether a conviction for a particular type of crime qualifies as a predicate offense presents a purely legal question, sparking de novo review.  See United States v. De Jesus, 984 F.2d 21, 23 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1830, 123 L.Ed.2d 458 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Crimes of Violence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To constitute a crime of violence, a felony must fit into one of several pigeonholes.  To be specific, a crime of violence is any state or federal offense punishable by more than one year in prison that (1) \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\" U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(i), or (2) reposes on a short list of specially enumerated crimes such as \"burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion,\" U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii), or (3) \"involves use of explosives,\" id., or (4) \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining whether a previous conviction represents a crime of violence necessitates a formal categorical approach.  See DeLuca, 17 F.3d at 8;  De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 23;   United States v. Bell, 966 F.2d 703, 704 (1st Cir.1992);   Fiore, 983 F.2d at 3;   see also Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (adopting categorical approach for analogous determination under Armed Career Criminal Act);   United States v. Doe, 960 F.2d 221, 223-24 (1st Cir.1992) (same).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As a rule, this type of approach is restricted to an examination of how the legislature has defined the crime, without any concomitant inquiry into the details of the defendant's actual criminal conduct.   See DeLuca, 17 F.3d at 8;   De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 23;   Fiore, 983 F.2d at 3;   see also Taylor, 495 U.S. at 600, 110 S.Ct. at 2159.   Nevertheless, \"there are certain limited circumstances in which some investigation beyond the formal nature of the charge may be warranted.\"   DeLuca, 17 F.3d at 8 n. 3;   accord Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160;   Doe, 960 F.2d at 224.  For example, if the statutory description is inscrutable, or if it blankets both violent and non-violent crimes, a court may peek beneath the coverlet.   See, e.g., United States v. Harris, 964 F.2d 1234, 1235 (1st Cir.1992) (employing similar exception in an ACCA case);   see also Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602-03, 110 S.Ct. at 2160.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These principles inform our treatment of the instant case.  Here, the first three avenues to dubbing the 1979 offenses crimes of violence are dead ends;  the government concedes--as, indeed, it must--that no count of conviction was for a felony of which physical force is an element, or for a felony listed by name in the career offender guideline, or for a felony involving the use of explosives.  Thus, the issue before us hinges on whether any of the counts of conviction, considered from a categorical standpoint, can be said to \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii);  see also U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2, comment. n. 2(B).IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The label \"racketeering,\" though pejorative, does not shed much light on whether the activity in question poses (or fails to pose) a serious potential risk of violence.  After all, racketeering comes in many shapes and sizes, and covers a wide range of activities.  Those activities are uniformly nefarious and almost invariably nasty--but they are not necessarily violent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  One is reminded of the label \"conspiracy,\" a label so encompassing that it \"says next to nothing about the underlying nature of the crime,\" and, therefore, gives a court no real insight into whether a conviction bearing the label can be classified as a crime of violence.  Fiore, 983 F.2d at 3.   Since the statutory language describing racketeering, taken alone, tells us so little, we can only conclude that convictions for racketeering sometimes will constitute predicate offenses and sometimes will not.  It follows, a fortiori, that the same is true vis-a-vis convictions for conspiracy to engage in racketeering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because crimes of this androgynous sort, not unlike chameleons, \"will necessarily take on the characteristics and coloration of [their] environment,\" id.  (discussing general conspiracy), some exploration of that environment must be undertaken.  Yet, a caveat is in order:  even where, as here, the category limned in the statute is an inexact semantic construct, warranting further inquiry, the task of classification continues to demand a categorical as opposed to a fact-sensitive analysis.  This means that if previous convictions for racketeering or racketeering conspiracy are in issue, a court seeking to ascertain the appropriateness of predicate offense treatment under Taylor principles must ask categorically oriented questions such as:  \"Racketeering by what means?\"  \"Racketeering to what end?\"   And in answering these questions, the court should not plunge into the details of a particular defendant's conduct, but, rather, again in fidelity to Taylor principles, should merely assess the nature and object of the racketeering activity as described in the indictment and fleshed out in the jury instructions.  See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160;  De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 23 n. 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This methodology makes good sense, for it cabins further inquiry in keeping with its categorical roots, permitting the court to take a predetermined sample of the earlier case and evaluate its composition without at the same time inviting the judicial equivalent of an archaeological dig.  We turn, therefore, to the charging papers and jury instructions in the 1979 case to ascertain the nature and object of the racketeering activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The earlier indictment identified the \"racketeering activity\" with which Winter was charged as \"horse race fixing,\" and described the offenses comprising the alleged pattern of racketeering activity as sports bribery, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 224, and travel in aid of racketeering, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(3).  This format creates two possible pathways to finding that the 1979 offenses are crimes of violence.  We explore each of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Sports Bribery.   Sports bribery is a discrete, meaningful rubric, itself susceptible of categorical analysis;  therefore, we need look no further than the language of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Given that wording, it is certainly possible that sports bribery can bring violence into play--but that is not the critical determinant.  A categorical approach is not concerned with testing either the outer limits of statutory language or the myriad of possibilities girdled by that language;  instead, a categorical approach is concerned with the usual type of conduct that the statute purposes to proscribe.  See De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 24.   Thus, a court asked to determine whether an offense is (or is not) a crime of violence within the meaning of the \"otherwise\" clause of the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii), must focus on \"the degree of risk, expressed in terms of the probability of physical harm presented by the mine-run of conduct that falls within the heartland of the statute.\"  De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this standard, the government's argument cannot prosper.  Sports bribery, in general, simply lacks the \"inherent risk of violent outbreak\" necessary to justify classifying it as a crime of violence.  Id. at 25;  see also Fiore, 983 F.2d at 4 (to come within the crime of violence ambit, a crime, viewed generically, must pose a substantial potential for episodic violence);  Doe, 960 F.2d at 224-25 (finding \"felon-in-possession\" convictions not to qualify as predicate offenses under ACCA because such convictions do not usually involve violent conduct).  Since there is no sound basis for saying that violence is a normal, usual, or customary concomitant of sports bribery, the crime is not a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Travel in Aid of Racketeering.   The statute underlying the Travel Act counts outlaws travel in interstate commerce with intent to--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>(1) distribute the proceeds of any unlawful activity;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>(2) commit any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(3) otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity,....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Based on this statute, the government maintains that, because the Travel Act encompasses both violent and non-violent offenses, the court below should have delved into defendant's actual conduct to determine if his offenses constituted crimes of violence.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the government is correct in stating that the Travel Act reaches violent as well as non-violent conduct.  Compare id. Sec. 1952(a)(2) (proscribing travel with intent to \"commit any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity\") with id. Sec. 1952(a)(1), (3) (proscribing generically non-violent conduct).  But the statute's breadth does not give an inquiring court license to roam at will through the record of each individual case.  Rather, Taylor demands that a court poised at such a crossroads consult a limited array of materials--principally the indictment and jury instructions--in determining if the offense can be classified as a crime of violence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602-03, 110 S.Ct. at 2160;  see also Harris, 964 F.2d at 1235;  Doe, 960 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the permitted review establishes that, under applicable Taylor principles, the Travel Act counts do not qualify as crimes of violence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Those counts charged Winter with commissioning travel to assist in \"effecting by bribery the outcome of ... horse races.\"   Although fixing horse races is antisocial conduct that may on occasion utilize violence as a tool, it does not carry with it an inherent risk of violent outbreak sufficient to merit classification as a crime of violence.  In other words, because violence is not a usual accouterment of horse race fixing, the degree of risk, expressed in terms of the probability of physical harm, associated with the mine-run of conduct that comprises the heartland of the statute is relatively low.  And because that is so, the \"otherwise\" clause in the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii), does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also a second reason why the two Travel Act counts are poor candidates for inclusion as predicate offenses.  Neither of these counts invoked the Travel Act generally;  their language focused single-mindedly on clause (3), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(3), a subsection of the Travel Act that criminalizes predominantly non-violent conduct, rather than clause (2), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(2), a subsection that criminalizes predominantly violent conduct.  To convict on the Travel Act counts, therefore, the jury was required only to find that Winter used bribes to rig horse races and caused Ciulla to travel in aid of the scheme.  The charges did not require a finding that the offense involved violence in any way, shape, or form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury instructions bear this out;  in briefing the jurors on the Travel Act counts, the trial judge defined those counts in the vernacular of section 1952(a)(3), abjured any suggestion that the counts implicated section 1952(a)(2), and identified bribery as the unlawful activity to which the travel was directed.  Because the defendant was charged with and convicted of violating the Travel Act under the statute's non-violent alternative, the Travel Act counts did not serve to transmogrify the 1979 offenses into crimes of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  The Pennsylvania Statute.   The government has another string to its bow.  Because the Travel Act counts mention the violation of a Pennsylvania statute, see supra note 9, and that statute includes violent as well as non-violent methods of perpetrating the specified crime,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> the government hypothesizes that we can explore whether Winter actually conducted the bribery scheme in a brutal manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning is specious.  Winter was neither charged with, nor convicted of, violating the Pennsylvania statute;  and the indictment does not embrace the language of that statute.  Taylor and its progeny in no way suggest that a reviewing court should investigate conduct ranging outside the counts of conviction for purposes of determining career offender status.  Indeed, the case law teaches the opposite lesson.  See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160;  Doe, 960 F.2d at 224;  United States v. Leavitt, 925 F.2d 516, 517-18 (1st Cir.1991);  see also U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2, comment. n. 2(B) (explaining that \"the conduct of which the defendant was convicted is the focus of inquiry\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, although the Pennsylvania statute includes a violent method of horse race fixing among the several methods identified therein, the state statute is mentioned only in the Travel Act counts.  In turn, those counts, as charged in the indictment, by their very wording exclude that violent method, for they are worded exclusively in terms of a non-violent alternative, subsection (a)(3) of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(3).  Thus, the passing mention of the Pennsylvania bribery statute is of no consequence anent the applicability of the career offender guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Categorically speaking, racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, travel in aid of racketeering, and sports bribery all fail, in the circumstances of this case, to qualify as crimes of violence under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1.  Hence, the government's claim that assaultive behavior was used to advance Winter's racketeering activities, even if true, is beside the point.  We need go no further:  although Winter, as the government asserts, may well have demonstrated a penchant for violence, he could not appropriately have been sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The November 1992 edition of the guidelines applies in this case.

See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1.  In this case, defendant concedes that most--but not all--of these preconditions obtain:  he committed the offense of conviction more than four decades after turning eighteen;  that offense is a controlled substance offense;  and he labors under the burden of a prior conviction for extortion--a crime that is considered a crime of violence, see United States v. DeLuca, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195223\"><a href=\"/opinion/195223/united-states-v-deluca/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 7-9 (1st Cir.1994);  see also U.S.S.G.

In the court below, the government nominated a candidate to fill out the slate--a racketeering indictment that resulted in defendant's conviction in 1979, after trial, for an amalgam of offenses, namely, engaging in racketeering activity (horse race fixing), see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c), conspiracy to engage in such activity, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d), sports bribery, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 224, and travel in aid of racketeering (horse race fixing), see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The lower court did not think the government's candidate qualified for election to the \"crime of violence\" ranks, notwithstanding the government's claim that strong-arm tactics were standard fare in the racketeering and racketeering-related activities over which Winter presided.  Consequently, the court decreed that, for want of a second predicate offense, the career offender guideline did not pertain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant appeal turns on the appropriateness of categorizing at least one of the 1979 offenses as a crime of violence.

See DeLuca, 17 F.3d at 8;   De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 23;   Fiore, 983 F.2d at 3;   see also Taylor, 495 U.S. at 600, 110 S.Ct. at 2159.   Nevertheless, \"there are certain limited circumstances in which some investigation beyond the formal nature of the charge may be warranted.\"   DeLuca, 17 F.3d at 8 n. 3;   accord Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160;   Doe, 960 F.2d at 224.  For example, if the statutory description is inscrutable, or if it blankets both violent and non-violent crimes, a court may peek beneath the coverlet.   See, e.g., United States v. Harris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583860\"><a href=\"/opinion/583860/united-states-v-gerald-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1234</span></a></span>, 1235 (1st Cir.1992) (employing similar exception in an ACCA case);   see also Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602-03, 110 S.Ct. at 2160.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These principles inform our treatment of the instant case.  Here, the first three avenues to dubbing the 1979 offenses crimes of violence are dead ends;  the government concedes--as, indeed, it must--that no count of conviction was for a felony of which physical force is an element, or for a felony listed by name in the career offender guideline, or for a felony involving the use of explosives.  Thus, the issue before us hinges on whether any of the counts of conviction, considered from a categorical standpoint, can be said to \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii);  see also U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2, comment. n. 2(B).IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The label \"racketeering,\" though pejorative, does not shed much light on whether the activity in question poses (or fails to pose) a serious potential risk of violence.  After all, racketeering comes in many shapes and sizes, and covers a wide range of activities.  Those activities are uniformly nefarious and almost invariably nasty--but they are not necessarily violent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  One is reminded of the label \"conspiracy,\" a label so encompassing that it \"says next to nothing about the underlying nature of the crime,\" and, therefore, gives a court no real insight into whether a conviction bearing the label can be classified as a crime of violence.  Fiore, 983 F.2d at 3.   Since the statutory language describing racketeering, taken alone, tells us so little, we can only conclude that convictions for racketeering sometimes will constitute predicate offenses and sometimes will not.  It follows, a fortiori, that the same is true vis-a-vis convictions for conspiracy to engage in racketeering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because crimes of this androgynous sort, not unlike chameleons, \"will necessarily take on the characteristics and coloration of [their] environment,\" id.  (discussing general conspiracy), some exploration of that environment must be undertaken.  Yet, a caveat is in order:  even where, as here, the category limned in the statute is an inexact semantic construct, warranting further inquiry, the task of classification continues to demand a categorical as opposed to a fact-sensitive analysis.  This means that if previous convictions for racketeering or racketeering conspiracy are in issue, a court seeking to ascertain the appropriateness of predicate offense treatment under Taylor principles must ask categorically oriented questions such as:  \"Racketeering by what means?\"  \"Racketeering to what end?\"   And in answering these questions, the court should not plunge into the details of a particular defendant's conduct, but, rather, again in fidelity to Taylor principles, should merely assess the nature and object of the racketeering activity as described in the indictment and fleshed out in the jury instructions.  See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160;  De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 23 n. 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This methodology makes good sense, for it cabins further inquiry in keeping with its categorical roots, permitting the court to take a predetermined sample of the earlier case and evaluate its composition without at the same time inviting the judicial equivalent of an archaeological dig.  We turn, therefore, to the charging papers and jury instructions in the 1979 case to ascertain the nature and object of the racketeering activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The earlier indictment identified the \"racketeering activity\" with which Winter was charged as \"horse race fixing,\" and described the offenses comprising the alleged pattern of racketeering activity as sports bribery, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 224, and travel in aid of racketeering, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(3).  This format creates two possible pathways to finding that the 1979 offenses are crimes of violence.  We explore each of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Sports Bribery.   Sports bribery is a discrete, meaningful rubric, itself susceptible of categorical analysis;  therefore, we need look no further than the language of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Given that wording, it is certainly possible that sports bribery can bring violence into play--but that is not the critical determinant.  A categorical approach is not concerned with testing either the outer limits of statutory language or the myriad of possibilities girdled by that language;  instead, a categorical approach is concerned with the usual type of conduct that the statute purposes to proscribe.  See De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 24.   Thus, a court asked to determine whether an offense is (or is not) a crime of violence within the meaning of the \"otherwise\" clause of the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii), must focus on \"the degree of risk, expressed in terms of the probability of physical harm presented by the mine-run of conduct that falls within the heartland of the statute.\"  De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this standard, the government's argument cannot prosper.  Sports bribery, in general, simply lacks the \"inherent risk of violent outbreak\" necessary to justify classifying it as a crime of violence.  Id. at 25;  see also Fiore, 983 F.2d at 4 (to come within the crime of violence ambit, a crime, viewed generically, must pose a substantial potential for episodic violence);  Doe, 960 F.2d at 224-25 (finding \"felon-in-possession\" convictions not to qualify as predicate offenses under ACCA because such convictions do not usually involve violent conduct).  Since there is no sound basis for saying that violence is a normal, usual, or customary concomitant of sports bribery, the crime is not a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Travel in Aid of Racketeering.   The statute underlying the Travel Act counts outlaws travel in interstate commerce with intent to--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>(1) distribute the proceeds of any unlawful activity;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>(2) commit any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(3) otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity,....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Based on this statute, the government maintains that, because the Travel Act encompasses both violent and non-violent offenses, the court below should have delved into defendant's actual conduct to determine if his offenses constituted crimes of violence.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the government is correct in stating that the Travel Act reaches violent as well as non-violent conduct.  Compare id. Sec. 1952(a)(2) (proscribing travel with intent to \"commit any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity\") with id. Sec. 1952(a)(1), (3) (proscribing generically non-violent conduct).  But the statute's breadth does not give an inquiring court license to roam at will through the record of each individual case.  Rather, Taylor demands that a court poised at such a crossroads consult a limited array of materials--principally the indictment and jury instructions--in determining if the offense can be classified as a crime of violence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602-03, 110 S.Ct. at 2160;  see also Harris, 964 F.2d at 1235;  Doe, 960 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the permitted review establishes that, under applicable Taylor principles, the Travel Act counts do not qualify as crimes of violence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Those counts charged Winter with commissioning travel to assist in \"effecting by bribery the outcome of ... horse races.\"   Although fixing horse races is antisocial conduct that may on occasion utilize violence as a tool, it does not carry with it an inherent risk of violent outbreak sufficient to merit classification as a crime of violence.  In other words, because violence is not a usual accouterment of horse race fixing, the degree of risk, expressed in terms of the probability of physical harm, associated with the mine-run of conduct that comprises the heartland of the statute is relatively low.  And because that is so, the \"otherwise\" clause in the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii), does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also a second reason why the two Travel Act counts are poor candidates for inclusion as predicate offenses.  Neither of these counts invoked the Travel Act generally;  their language focused single-mindedly on clause (3), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(3), a subsection of the Travel Act that criminalizes predominantly non-violent conduct, rather than clause (2), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(2), a subsection that criminalizes predominantly violent conduct.  To convict on the Travel Act counts, therefore, the jury was required only to find that Winter used bribes to rig horse races and caused Ciulla to travel in aid of the scheme.  The charges did not require a finding that the offense involved violence in any way, shape, or form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury instructions bear this out;  in briefing the jurors on the Travel Act counts, the trial judge defined those counts in the vernacular of section 1952(a)(3), abjured any suggestion that the counts implicated section 1952(a)(2), and identified bribery as the unlawful activity to which the travel was directed.  Because the defendant was charged with and convicted of violating the Travel Act under the statute's non-violent alternative, the Travel Act counts did not serve to transmogrify the 1979 offenses into crimes of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  The Pennsylvania Statute.   The government has another string to its bow.  Because the Travel Act counts mention the violation of a Pennsylvania statute, see supra note 9, and that statute includes violent as well as non-violent methods of perpetrating the specified crime,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> the government hypothesizes that we can explore whether Winter actually conducted the bribery scheme in a brutal manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning is specious.  Winter was neither charged with, nor convicted of, violating the Pennsylvania statute;  and the indictment does not embrace the language of that statute.  Taylor and its progeny in no way suggest that a reviewing court should investigate conduct ranging outside the counts of conviction for purposes of determining career offender status.  Indeed, the case law teaches the opposite lesson.  See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160;  Doe, 960 F.2d at 224;  United States v. Leavitt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555765\"><a href=\"/opinion/555765/united-states-v-tony-allen-leavitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 517-18 (1st Cir.1991);  see also U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2, comment. n. 2(B) (explaining that \"the conduct of which the defendant was convicted is the focus of inquiry\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, although the Pennsylvania statute includes a violent method of horse race fixing among the several methods identified therein, the state statute is mentioned only in the Travel Act counts.  In turn, those counts, as charged in the indictment, by their very wording exclude that violent method, for they are worded exclusively in terms of a non-violent alternative, subsection (a)(3) of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1952(a)(3).  Thus, the passing mention of the Pennsylvania bribery statute is of no consequence anent the applicability of the career offender guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Categorically speaking, racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, travel in aid of racketeering, and sports bribery all fail, in the circumstances of this case, to qualify as crimes of violence under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1.  Hence, the government's claim that assaultive behavior was used to advance Winter's racketeering activities, even if true, is beside the point.  We need go no further:  although Winter, as the government asserts, may well have demonstrated a penchant for violence, he could not appropriately have been sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The November 1992 edition of the guidelines applies in this case.
