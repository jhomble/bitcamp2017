Pro-se appellant, Roger Anyon, a patient at\n               \n\nthe  Massachusetts Treatment  Center  for Sexually  Dangerous\n\nPersons,  alleges  that  the   recently  revised  eligibility\n\nrequirements for reintegrating Treatment Center patients into\n\nthe  community   violate  his   rights   under  the   federal\n\nconstitution  and the  federal consent  decree  requiring the\n\nremedying of conditions at the Treatment Center.   See, e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nWilliams v. Lesiak, 822 F.2d 1223 (1st Cir. 1987); Langton v.\n                                                          \n\nJohnston,  928  F.2d  1206   (1st  Cir.  1991).     He  seeks\n        \n\ndeclaratory  and injunctive relief.1   Appellees are officers\n\nand  employees of  the Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts.   The\n\ndistrict court  dismissed Anyon's  complaint  for failure  to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.  We affirm.\n\n                          Background\n\n     Anyon is under  commitment to the Treatment Center for a\n\nperiod  of one day  to life.   He is also  under a concurrent\n\ncriminal sentence of imprisonment for  life.  As a patient at\n\nthe  Treatment Center,  Anyon is  entitled  to mental  health\n\ntreatment   and  to  be  released  when  no  longer  sexually\n\ndangerous.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 123A   9.  Upon a determination\n\nthat  he  is  no  longer  sexually  dangerous,  he  would  be\n\ndischarged  from the  Treatment Center  and  returned to  the\n\nDepartment of Corrections to serve out any unexpired criminal\n\nsentence.  Id.  The Massachusetts Department of Mental Health\n             \n\n                    \n\n1.  Anyon has dropped all claims seeking monetary relief.\n\n                             -2-\n\nis required to establish a program at the Treatment Center to\n\nprovide \"in a manner consistent with security considerations,\n\nfor the restrictive  integration of [a]  patient into a  non-\n\ncustodial  environment.\"   Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 123A,    8.   A\n\npatient  will be  eligible  for this  program only  if, inter\n                                                             \n\nalia, \"he  will not present  a danger to the  community under\n    \n\nthe  controls provided by  the program.\"   Id.   Furthermore,\n                                             \n\nunder  a partial  consent decree  first entered in  1975, the\n\nDepartment  of  Mental Health  has agreed  to develop  a plan\n\nproviding   for  adequate  treatment   for  patients  at  the\n\nTreatment Center.   Among  other things,  the Department  has\n\nagreed to provide \"for the day or other short-term release of\n\nTreatment Center patients for  approved programs outside  the\n\nTreatment Center where  such relief is deemed  appropriate by\n\nthe Department of  Mental Health.\"  See Langton,  928 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n1228.\n\n     Anyon participated in the short-term release program for\n\nseveral  years  prior to  August  1991.    At that  time,  in\n\nresponse  to escapes by  two residents from  the program, the\n\nDepartment  suspended   the  program  for  review  to  ensure\n\nconsistency with  both public  safety and  clinical concerns.\n\nAs a result  of the review, the Department  adopted new rules\n\nfor what is  now called the Transition Program.   Under these\n\nrevised  rules,  a resident,  like  Anyon,  who  is  under  a\n\ncriminal sentence and neither paroled to the Treatment Center\n\n                             -3-\n\nnor  eligible for parole, is ineligible to participate in the\n\nprogram.  Anyon  asserts that these Transition  Program rules\n\ndeprive him  of his constitutional rights to  due process and\n\nequal  protection,  and  violate  his  constitutional  rights\n\nagainst ex  post  facto  legislation  and  double  jeopardy.2\n\nFinally he  asserts that  the rules are  in violation  of the\n\nfederal consent decree.\n\n                          Discussion\n\n     Anyon has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a\n\nclaim  that either his substantive or his procedural right to\n\ndue process has  been violated.  The revision  of the program\n\nwas  not  so \"outrageous\"  as  to constitute  a  violation of\n\nsubstantive due process.   See Amsden v. Moran  904 F.2d 748,\n                                              \n\n754  (1st Cir.  1990),  cert. denied,  498 U.S.  1041 (1991).\n                                    \n\nMoreover,  the state  is  not  prohibited  from  making  this\n\nrevision  by  the  fact  that  it  extinguished  any  liberty\n\ninterest Anyon may have had  under the prior rules for short-\n\nterm release.  See Tracy  v. Salamack, 572 F.2d 393,  396 (2d\n                                     \n\nCir.   1978)  (prisoners  who  were  previously  entitled  to\n\nparticipate in transition program have no entitlement to such\n\nparticipation  which would  \"have the  effect of  prohibiting\n\nalteration   of  the   underlying  law   which  creates   the\n\nentitlement\").   Finally, since  Anyon concedes that  he does\n\n                    \n\n2.  Anyon  also asserts that the revised program violates the\neighth  amendment  prohibition  against  cruel  and   unusual\npunishment.  This claim is without merit.\n\n                             -4-\n\nnot meet the  eligibility requirements of the  revised rules,\n\nhe no longer has any state created liberty interest in short-\n\nterm  release  which  would implicate  the  federal  right to\n\nprocedural due process.   \n\n     Likewise,  the  Transition  Program  rules  are  not  in\n\nviolation of the equal protection clause.  The distinction in\n\nthe  revised rules between civilly committed patients under a\n\ncriminal sentence and those who are not is rationally related\n\nto the legitimate  state interest in  ensuring the safety  of\n\nthe community.  See Whiting v. Westerly, 942 F.2d 18, 23 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1991).\n\n     Anyon's allegations  that the  Transition Program  rules\n\nviolate the double jeopardy and  ex post facto clauses of the\n\nConstitution  fail because both these clauses pertain only to\n\npunishments  inflicted   by  the  government.     See,  e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nHelvering  v. Mitchell, 303  U.S. 391, 398-99  (1938) (double\n                      \n\njeopardy); Cummings  v. Missouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 325-\n                                \n\n26 (1867) (ex post facto).   The revised rules for short-term\n\nrelease,  however, are not punitive but rather related to the\n\nstate's concern for  community safety.  See  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nHalper, 490 U.S. 435, 448 (1989) (civil as well as a criminal\n      \n\nsanction constitutes punishment  only when it serves  aims of\n\nretribution or deterrence).   As  regards Anyon's  allegation\n\nthat he has been \"punished\" by being deprived of his previous\n\nright  to  participate  in  the  short-term  release program,\n\n                             -5-\n\ninsofar as this is an allegation that he has been deprived of\n\nthe adequate treatment  required by the constitution  and the\n\nfederal  consent  decree,  we  think  this  concern  is  best\n\naddressed through  an action  to enforce  the consent  decree\n\nsince  that  decree \"'require[s]  the  provision of  adequate\n\ntreatment  for [Treatment Center] patients' at a level [even]\n\nbeyond  that   required  by  any   applicable  constitutional\n\nminima.\"   Langton, 928 F.2d  at 1217.   Insofar as it  is an\n                  \n\nallegation that he has been deprived of treatment beyond that\n\nrequired  by the  constitution and  the  consent decree,  the\n\nrevised  rules are  not  punitive but  the  \"revocation of  a\n\nprivilege voluntarily granted.\"   See Helvering, 303  U.S. at\n                                               \n\n399.  As such, they do not implicate either the ex post facto\n\nor the double jeopardy clause.3 \n\n     Finally,  we find  no  error  in  the  district  court's\n\nfailure to consider Anyon's claims that his  rights under the\n\napplicable  consent   decree   have  been   violated.     The\n\nappropriate  vehicle for enforcement of the consent decree is\n\nan action for  contempt brought before the  court responsible\n\nfor the decree.   See, e.g.,  DeGidio v. Pung, 920  F.2d 525,\n                                             \n\n534 (8th Cir.  1990); Green v. McKaskle, 788  F.2d 1116, 1123\n                                       \n\n(5th  Cir.  1986).   Allowing  the  decree to  be  challenged\n\nthrough an individual  action for declaratory and  injunctive\n\n                    \n\n3.  We express  no  opinion  as to  whether  or  not  Anyon's\nparticipation in the  release program is within  the scope of\ntreatment required by the constitution or the consent decree.\n\n                             -6-\n\nrelief  \"would tend  to  discourage governmental  authorities\n\nfrom  entering  into   decrees  in  public  law   litigation,\n\nencourage  the splintering  of  civil  rights  claims  on  an\n\nindividual basis, and promote disrespect for judicial decrees\n\nduly  entered following careful proactive review of the often\n\ncomplex mix  of individual  and institutional  considerations\n\ninvolved in such litigation.\"  Miller v. Dept. of Correction,\n                                                            \n\nNo. 91-2183, slip. op. at 15 (1st Cir., July 14, 1993).\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -7-\n",

Anyon  asserts that these Transition  Program rules\n\ndeprive him  of his constitutional rights to  due process and\n\nequal  protection,  and  violate  his  constitutional  rights\n\nagainst ex  post  facto  legislation  and  double  jeopardy.2\n\nFinally he  asserts that  the rules are  in violation  of the\n\nfederal consent decree.\n\n                          Discussion\n\n     Anyon has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a\n\nclaim  that either his substantive or his procedural right to\n\ndue process has  been violated.  The revision  of the program\n\nwas  not  so \"outrageous\"  as  to constitute  a  violation of\n\nsubstantive due process.   See Amsden v.

Anyon  also asserts that the revised program violates the\neighth  amendment  prohibition  against  cruel  and   unusual\npunishment.

The distinction in\n\nthe  revised rules between civilly committed patients under a\n\ncriminal sentence and those who are not is rationally related\n\nto the legitimate  state interest in  ensuring the safety  of\n\nthe community.

See,  e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nHelvering  v.

The revised rules for short-term\n\nrelease,  however, are not punitive but rather related to the\n\nstate's concern for  community safety.  See  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nHalper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112259\"><a href=\"/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448 (1989) (civil as well as a criminal\n      \n\nsanction constitutes punishment  only when it serves  aims of\n\nretribution or deterrence).   As  regards Anyon's  allegation\n\nthat he has been \"punished\" by being deprived of his previous\n\nright  to  participate  in  the  short-term  release program,\n\n                             -5-\n\ninsofar as this is an allegation that he has been deprived of\n\nthe adequate treatment  required by the constitution  and the\n\nfederal  consent  decree,  we  think  this  concern  is  best\n\naddressed through  an action  to enforce  the consent  decree\n\nsince  that  decree \"'require[s]  the  provision of  adequate\n\ntreatment  for [Treatment Center] patients' at a level [even]\n\nbeyond  that   required  by  any   applicable  constitutional\n\nminima.\"   Langton, 928 F.2d  at 1217.   Insofar as it  is an\n                  \n\nallegation that he has been deprived of treatment beyond that\n\nrequired  by the  constitution and  the  consent decree,  the\n\nrevised  rules are  not  punitive but  the  \"revocation of  a\n\nprivilege voluntarily granted.\"   See Helvering, 303  U.S. at\n                                               \n\n399.  As such, they do not implicate either the ex post facto\n\nor the double jeopardy clause.3 \n\n     Finally,  we find  no  error  in  the  district  court's\n\nfailure to consider Anyon's claims that his  rights under the\n\napplicable  consent   decree   have  been   violated.     The\n\nappropriate  vehicle for enforcement of the consent decree is\n\nan action for  contempt brought before the  court responsible\n\nfor the decree.   See, e.g.,  DeGidio v.
