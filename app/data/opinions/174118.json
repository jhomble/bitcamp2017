Peter Mailloux (\"Mailloux\")\n\nfiled an administrative complaint against R&B Transportation, LLC\n\n(\"R&B\"), and its owner, Paul Beaudry (\"Beaudry\") (collectively\n\n\"Petitioners\"), alleging that Mailloux was unlawfully discharged\n\nfrom his job as a commercial trucker for his adherence to federal\n\nsafety standards.     Mailloux sought relief under the employee\n\nprotection provisions of Section 405 of the Surface Transportation\n\nAssistance Act of 1982 (\"the STAA\"), 49 U.S.C. § 31105.1       A final\n\ndecision and order of the U.S. Department of Labor's Administrative\n\nReview   Board   (\"ARB\")   determined   that   Mailloux's   termination\n\nviolated the STAA, and awarded backpay and other expenses.       After\n\ncareful review, we deny the petition.\n\n\n1\n   The STAA prohibits employers from taking adverse employment\nactions against employees, including drivers of commercial motor\nvehicles, who engage in certain protected activities. 49 U.S.C.\n§ 31105(j). Specifically, the STAA provides, in relevant part:\n\n     (a) Prohibitions.\n          (1) A person may not discharge an employee, or\n     discipline or discriminate against an employee regarding\n     pay, terms, or privileges of employment, because--\n               (A)(i) the employee, or another person at the\n     employee's request, has filed a complaint or begun a\n     proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor\n     vehicle safety or security regulation, standard, or\n     order, or has testified or will testify in such a\n     proceeding . . .\n               (B) the employee refuses to operate a vehicle\n     because--\n                    (i) the operation violates a regulation,\n     standard, or order of the United States related to\n     commercial motor vehicle safety, health, or security\n     . . . .\n\n49 U.S.C. § 31105(a)(1)(A)(i)-(B)(i).\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                                I.     Facts2\n\n           A.   Mailloux's Employment\n\n           Beaudry owns two trucking companies, R&B and Beaudry\n\nEnterprises.     He   also   co-owns    BAT     Express,   a   third   trucking\n\ncompany.   These three entities share office space and drivers.\n\nNeither Beaudry Enterprises nor BAT Express is a party to this\n\ncase.\n\n           In late-August 2004, Petitioners hired Mailloux as a\n\ndriver of a commercial motor carrier, an over-the-road truck, to\n\ndeliver loads on routes between New England and Florida.3                 During\n\nthe scope of his employment through December 17, 2004,4 Mailloux\n\nreported   to   Heather      Bagley    (\"Bagley\"),     who     was     Beaudry's\n\nadministrative assistant, that it was not possible to make various\n\ndeliveries on time without violating the Federal Motor Carrier\n\nSafety Act, the Department of Transportation's (\"DOT\") hours of\n\nservice regulation (the \"driving regulation\"), which restricts the\n\nnumber of hours drivers of commercial motor vehicles may work over\n\n\n2\n    These facts are drawn from the factual findings of                       the\nAdministrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), which the ARB affirmed.\n3\n   Mailloux's exact start date is disputed and germane to the back\npay issue, which Petitioners raise in this petition. See infra\nPart III.D.\n4\n   The ALJ found that Mailloux was fired on December 17, 2004, a\nfinding the ARB affirmed and is uncontested on appeal.\nNotwithstanding the ALJ's finding that Mailloux was \"discharged\" on\nDecember 21, 2004, and OSHA's order to Petitioners to pay Mailloux\nback wages from December 26, 2004, we thus adopt December 17, 2004,\nas Mailloux's undisputed termination date.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fa certain period of time. See 49 C.F.R. § 395.3(b)(2).5            Bagley\n\ninformed Mailloux that the deliveries had already been scheduled\n\nand could not be changed.\n\n           On December 17, 2004, Mailloux called Beaudry's home to\n\ninform Beaudry that he was unable to make a particular delivery\n\nfrom Florida on time both because he had a flat tire and because he\n\nhad already driven the maximum allowable number of hours under the\n\ndriving   regulation.       During   this   conversation,   Beaudry     told\n\nMailloux to return the truck to R&B's facility in New Hampshire and\n\nBeaudry   would   inquire    about    arranging   for   Mailloux   to     be\n\ntransported back to Florida.         Mailloux responded, \"I guess that\n\nmeans I'm fired.\"   Beaudry said only \"get the truck back up here\"\n\nbefore the conversation ended.        When Mailloux later spoke with a\n\nfellow R&B driver, the driver told Mailloux \"yeah, you're fired.\"\n\n\n\n\n5\n    49 C.F.R. § 395.3(b)(2) provides, in full:\n\n      (b) No motor carrier shall permit or require a driver of\n      a property-carrying commercial motor vehicle to drive,\n      nor shall any driver drive a property-carrying commercial\n      motor vehicle, regardless of the number of motor carriers\n      using the driver's services, for any period after . . .\n           (2) Having been on duty 70 hours in any period of 8\n      consecutive days if the employing motor carrier operates\n      commercial motor vehicles every day of the week.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           B.   OSHA Investigation and Testimony Before the ALJ\n\n           On   December   20,    2004,6    Mailloux   contacted      the   U.S.\n\nDepartment of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n\n(\"OSHA\") to report that he would soon be discharged from R&B and\n\nwanted to speak to someone.          The following day, Mailloux was,\n\naccording to the ALJ, \"discharged.\"\n\n           Later, on December 27, 2004, Mailloux met with Christine\n\nKidder (\"Kidder\"), an OSHA investigator, and told her that during\n\nhis employment with R&B he was continually required to drive in\n\nexcess of the driving regulation.          During this interview, Mailloux\n\ninformed Kidder that he routinely falsified his driving logs for\n\nR&B in order to provide the appearance that he was in compliance\n\nwith the driving regulation.\n\n           After   this    initial    interview      with   Mailloux,       OSHA\n\nconducted an investigation of R&B, including an interview with\n\nBeaudry.     When Kidder contacted Beaudry, he informed her that he\n\nhad fired Mailloux due to his inability to properly plan his trips,\n\nwhich were costing the company time and money.                  During this\n\ninterview,    Kidder   inquired    whether     R&B   followed   the    driving\n\nregulation.     Beaudry represented that he had never violated the\n\n\n\n6\n   The recommended decision and order of the ALJ indicates that\nMailloux initially called the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (\"OSHA\") investigator on \"December 20, 2005,\" and\nthat the investigator conducted the interview with Mailloux on\n\"December 27, 2005.\" However, it is clear from the record that\nthese events occurred on their respective dates in 2004.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fdriving    regulation.        Later,   during   the    ALJ   hearing,     Beaudry\n\ntestified that R&B submits written notices to drivers whose driving\n\nlogs are false or violate the driving regulation.                 Beaudry further\n\ntestified that he submitted such notices to Mailloux and ultimately\n\nfired him because he was driving in excess of the maximum hours\n\nallowable by the driving regulation.\n\n            Following her interview with Beaudry, Kidder contacted\n\nthe DOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (\"FMCSA\") and\n\nobtained compliance reviews and enforcement reports relating to R&B\n\n(\"the     DOT    reports\").       These   reviews     and    reports     are     the\n\ninvestigative reports prepared by \"an agent\"7 who visits a company\n\nto determine whether they are in compliance with the driving\n\nregulation.      Based on an audit the FMCSA conducted of R&B and on\n\nKidder's own review of the DOT reports, Kidder learned that Beaudry\n\nand all three of the companies in which he had an interest had\n\npreviously been cited for violating the driving regulation.8                     The\n\nmost    recent    DOT   report,   dated   April     12,    2005,    showed     R&B's\n\nviolations      of   the   driving   regulation,      as   well    as   other    DOT\n\nregulations, for the period August 23, 2004, to February 22, 2005,\n\na time frame that included Mailloux's employment.                  Additionally,\n\n\n7\n  The record does not indicate what sort of \"agent\" conducted this\ninvestigation.\n8\n   The fact that these three companies share office space and\ndrivers is, according to testimony the Division Administrator of\nthe DOT's FMCSA provided to the ALJ, the reason their compliance\nwith the driving regulation was jointly reviewed.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fpast DOT reports showed that R&B and the other two trucking\n\ncompanies in which Beaudry had an interest had previously been\n\ncited for violations on September 14, 2000; January 22, 2001; and\n\nJune 14, 2001.     Petitioners paid civil penalties associated with\n\nsome of these violations.\n\n           As part of Kidder's investigation, she also interviewed\n\nBagley, who informed her that R&B drivers routinely violated the\n\ndriving regulation because they often could not otherwise complete\n\ntheir trips on time.    Bagley stated that drivers would complain to\n\nher about driving in excess of the regulation, and the company\n\nconsequently experienced high turnover.      Bagley later testified to\n\nthe ALJ in a deposition that when she hired drivers and they\n\ninquired about compliance with the driving regulation, she would\n\ntell them that the company complied with the regulation, even\n\nthough she knew Beaudry would soon have them driving in excess of\n\nit. Bagley also testified to the ALJ that Trish Patrick, Beaudry's\n\ndaughter and employee, instructed Bagley to separate toll receipts\n\nfrom a truck driver's time log when they did not match in order to\n\nconceal violations of the driving regulation.\n\n           Scott Hill (\"Hill\"), another R&B driver, testified about\n\nhis experience working for Petitioners. Like Mailloux, Hill worked\n\nfor R&B from August 2004 until December 2004. Hill testified that,\n\nduring   his   employment   with   Petitioners,   he   consistently   made\n\ndeliveries in excess of the driving regulation.         Hill stated that\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fhe falsified his driving logs to make it appear as if he were\n\ndriving within the legal limitations.             Hill further testified that\n\nBeaudry met with him about his violations, and used Mapquest to\n\nillustrate how a driver could make his deliveries on time and still\n\ncomply with the driving regulation.                Hill also testified that\n\nBeaudry suggested that when Hill was driving in Florida he could\n\nlog his driving hours as a local delivery, even though it was an\n\ninterstate one. Hill additionally testified that he brought up the\n\ndriving regulation issue with Beaudry. Hill stated he told Beaudry\n\nat one point that he needed \"a break, I got to slow down, I want to\n\nrun legal,\" and that Beaudry responded that he had \"other drivers\n\nthat will run.\"     Hill testified that he stopped working for R&B on\n\nDecember 30, 2004, because he was exhausted.\n\n                          II.   Procedural History\n\n           A.    OSHA Findings and Petitioners' Appeal (2006)\n\n           On January 9, 2006, OSHA issued its findings.                      OSHA\n\ndetermined   that   Petitioners        violated    the    STAA   by   discharging\n\nMailloux after his complaint to Petitioners regarding his work\n\nhours.   OSHA ordered Petitioners to pay Mailloux back wages from\n\nDecember 26, 2004, through February 27, 2005, the date on which he\n\ncommenced his new employment.\n\n           The   same     day   OSHA   issued     its    findings,    Petitioners\n\nappealed OSHA's order to the ALJ. Petitioners argued that Mailloux\n\nwas   terminated    for    performing     poorly,       violating     the   driving\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fregulation,     and   failing    to    communicate     with    the     company's\n\ndispatcher in a timely manner.\n\n           B.   ALJ's Recommended Decision and Order (2007)\n\n           Following    a    hearing,    the    ALJ   issued   a     recommended\n\ndecision and order on June 8, 2007.          The ALJ observed that the DOT\n\nreports revealed that R&B's violations of the driving regulation\n\nexisted before, during, and after Mailloux's employment with the\n\ncompany.   The ALJ noted that the DOT reports suggested a pattern of\n\nviolations      associated      with    R&B's     day-to-day         operations.\n\nAdditionally, the ALJ relied on these records and other evidence to\n\nfind that Mailloux was terminated in violation of the STAA.                  The\n\nALJ concluded that Mailloux was entitled to relief, which included\n\nreinstatement and compensatory damages, such as back pay, pursuant\n\nto 49 U.S.C. § 31105(b)(3)(A).9         Because Mailloux was not seeking\n\nreinstatement, the ALJ granted him back pay from December 17, 2004,\n\n\n\n9\n   49 U.S.C. § 31105(b)(3)(A), concerning \"Filing complaints and\nprocedures,\" provides, in full:\n\n     (3) (A) If the Secretary of Labor decides, on the basis\n     of a complaint, a person violated subsection (a) of this\n     section, the Secretary of Labor shall order the person\n     to--\n          (i) take affirmative action to abate the violation;\n          (ii) reinstate the complainant to the former\n     position with the same pay and terms and privileges of\n     employment; and\n          (iii) pay compensatory damages, including backpay\n     with interest and compensation for any special damages\n     sustained as a result of the discrimination, including\n     litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable\n     attorney fees.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthe date of his termination, to February 27, 2005, when he obtained\n\nnew employment, as well as travel expenses associated with the\n\nlitigation.    The ALJ's order suggested that Petitioners compensate\n\nMailloux in the amount of $9,946.80 plus interest for back pay,10\n\nand $314.58 for reimbursed travel expenses.   Pursuant to 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1978.109(a), the ALJ's recommendation was automatically forwarded\n\nfor review to the ARB.\n\n          C.    ARB's Final Decision and Order (2009)\n\n          On June 26, 2009, the ARB issued its final decision and\n\norder.   The ARB affirmed the recommendation by the ALJ and ruled\n\nthat Mailloux had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he\n\nhad engaged in a protected activity (when Mailloux informed Beaudry\n\nduring the December 17, 2004, telephone conversation that Mailloux\n\ncould not complete the delivery then assigned to him without\n\nviolating the driving regulation), that R&B was aware of the\n\nprotected activity, and that R&B took an adverse employment action\n\n(the December 17, 2004, termination) against Mailloux because of\n\nit.\n\n\n\n\n10\n    The ALJ calculated this wage rate loss using the following\nfigures. Mailloux worked for a total of 108 days between his start\ndate on August 25, 2004, and his end date on December 17, 2004.\nDuring that time, he earned $14,919.66, which, when divided by 108,\nyielded a daily wage rate of $138.15. Given that Mailloux was out\nof work for 72 days between his end date with R&B and the start\ndate of his new employment on February 27, 2005, his daily wage of\n$138.15 multiplied by 72 days out of work yielded the $9,946.80\nwage rate loss.\n\n                                -10-\n\f           The ARB held that substantial evidence on the record\n\nsupported the ALJ's factual findings, and that those findings were\n\nconclusive.     The ARB also held that the ALJ did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the DOT reports to which Kidder and a DOT\n\nrepresentative testified, and that these reports were reliable\n\nindicators of R&B's actual violations of the driving regulation.\n\nAdditionally, the ARB found that there was substantial evidence to\n\nsupport the ALJ's finding that R&B required its drivers to drive in\n\nexcess of the driving regulation and that its drivers were not\n\ndisciplined for hours of service violations.                Furthermore, the ARB\n\nfound substantial evidence in the record, including the fact that\n\nBeaudry did not have Mailloux's driver's log record indicating a\n\nviolation of the driving regulation at the time he terminated him,\n\nto   support   the   ALJ's   finding      of   a   causal    connection   between\n\nMailloux's protected activity and his termination.\n\n           Petitioners       had   also   argued     that    the   ALJ   erred   in\n\ncalculating Mailloux's daily average wage rate with R&B, asserting\n\nthat Mailloux's actual start date was August 7, 2004, which, if\n\nused instead of August 25, 2004, would reduce his award for the 72-\n\nday period during which he was unemployed because it would increase\n\nthe total number of days he worked and thus decrease his daily\n\naverage wage rate.      Nevertheless, because the ARB found that R&B\n\ndid not properly raise this issue before the ALJ, the ARB declined\n\nto consider the issue on appeal and affirmed the recommended award.\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f            D.   Petition for Judicial Review (2009)\n\n            In August 2009, R&B and Beaudry timely petitioned this\n\ncourt to review the ARB's final decision and order.           Petitioners'\n\npetition raises three issues.       They argue that (1) evidence that\n\nR&B and other trucking companies owned by Beaudry had violated DOT\n\nregulations was improperly admitted by the ALJ into evidence; (2)\n\nthe   ARB   erroneously   upheld   the   ALJ's   decision   that   a   causal\n\nconnection existed between Mailloux's protected activity and the\n\nadverse employment action against him; and (3) the ARB erred in\n\nfinding that substantial evidence existed in the record to justify\n\nthe ALJ's decision regarding back pay.\n\n                            III.   Discussion\n\n            A.

See, e.g., United States v.\n\nRichardson, 515 F.3d 74, 84 (1st Cir. 2008); Curtin v. Office of\n\nPers. Mgmt., 846 F.2d 1373, 1378-79 (1st Cir. 1988); see also\n\nBarker v. Admin. Review Bd., 302 Fed. Appx. 248, 249 (5th Cir.\n\n2008)(\"An ALJ is granted broad discretion to make evidentiary\n\ndeterminations.\").      \"An abuse of discretion occurs when a relevant\n\nfactor deserving significant weight is overlooked, or when an\n\nimproper factor is accorded significant weight, or when the court\n\nconsiders the appropriate mix of factors, but commits a palpable\n\nerror of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.\"               United\n\nStates v. DeCicco, 370 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir. 2004)(citation and\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f                        ii.    Legal Framework\n\n            The    Federal      Rules    of    Evidence       do   not   apply    in    APA\n\nproceedings.       Instead, the rules of evidence in administrative\n\nhearings before an ALJ provide, in part, that\n\n            [e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is\n            not admissible to prove the character of a\n            person in order to show action in conformity\n            therewith. It may, however, be admissible for\n            other purposes, such as proof of motive,\n            opportunity,   intent,   preparation,    plan,\n            knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or\n            accident.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 18.404(b) (emphasis added).                    These rules of evidence\n\nalso provide the following hearsay exception, concerning \"[p]ublic\n\nrecords    and    reports\":      \"Records,         reports,     statements,      or    data\n\ncompilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting\n\nforth . . . [f]actual findings resulting from an investigation made\n\npursuant   to     authority     granted       by    law,   unless     the   sources     of\n\ninformation        or     other       circumstances             indicate      lack       of\n\ntrustworthiness.\"         29 C.F.R. § 18.803(a)(8).\n\n                        iii.   Analysis\n\n            The ARB held that the ALJ did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting the DOT reports, considering them within the \"[p]ublic\n\nrecords and reports\" hearsay exception and \"only to the extent that\n\nthey reflect R&B's knowledge of its obligations pursuant to the\n\nhours of service regulations.\"                 Petitioners argue that the ALJ\n\nimproperly       relied   on    the     DOT   reports      as      highly   prejudicial\n\ncharacter evidence that showed, besides R&B's knowledge of its\n\n                                          -14-\n\flegal obligations, which Petitioners claim was undisputed, that R&B\n\nwas acting in conformity with its past violations of the driving\n\nregulation. Respondent counters that the DOT reports were properly\n\nadmitted as \"[p]ublic records and reports\" and to show Beaudry's\n\nmotive and knowledge in terminating Mailloux's employment.\n\n           First, Petitioners do not dispute that the DOT reports\n\nare   \"[f]actual    findings   resulting    from   an    investigation     made\n\npursuant to authority granted by law.\"             Petitioners do contend,\n\nhowever, that the DOT reports \"indicate lack of trustworthiness.\"\n\nIn making this claim, Petitioners cite to a New Jersey Superior\n\nCourt case from 1988 that quotes a 1985 opinion from the Fifth\n\nCircuit   stating     that   \"OSHA   citations     are    the   opinions    of\n\ninvestigators and ordinarily do not 'carry with [them] the indicia\n\nof reliability that is inherent in government adopted safety\n\nstandards.'\"   Millison v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 545 A.2d\n\n213, 224 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1988)(alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Dixon v. Int'l Harvester Co., 754 F.2d 573, 581 n.5 (5th\n\nCir. 1985)).       In any event, as the ARB observed, R&B paid the\n\npenalties imposed by the DOT as a result of the admitted reports,\n\nthe terms of which explicitly stated that such payments \"constitute\n\nadmission of the violation(s).\"         These admissions bolstered the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\ftrustworthiness    of   the   DOT    reports,   supporting   the    ALJ's\n\nconsideration of the reports as being within its discretion.11\n\n          Second, Beaudry's knowledge in discharging Mailloux is,\n\nas discussed in Part III.C., relevant to the instant case.         The DOT\n\nreports suggested that Beaudry knew or should have known of the\n\ndriving regulation and R&B's failure to comply with it in the past.\n\nThe DOT reports indicated that Beaudry knew or should have known he\n\nwas not telling the truth when he told Kidder that he had never\n\nviolated the driving regulation, which undermined his credibility\n\nwhen testifying.    The Ninth Circuit has observed that, \"[w]hen\n\noffered to prove knowledge, . . . the prior act need not be similar\n\nto the charged act as long as the prior act was one which would\n\ntend to make the existence of the defendant's knowledge more\n\nprobable than it would be without the evidence.\"      United States v.\n\nRamirez-Jiminez, 967 F.2d 1321, 1326 (9th Cir. 1992).         Here, the\n\nprior acts of Petitioners were their violations of the driving\n\nregulation.   These acts would certainly be relevant as tending to\n\nshow that Petitioners were aware of their obligations under the\n\ndriving regulation, that their employees were supposed to comply\n\n\n\n\n11\n   Petitioners argue that their payment of the DOT penalties should\nnot be taken as an admission of the underlying violations because,\nPetitioners claim, they paid the penalties merely \"in an effort to\navoid litigation and to resolve the outstanding disputes.\" This\nargument is unavailing because Petitioners' reason for paying the\npenalties is irrelevant to their constructive admission.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fwith    it,    and     that    Petitioners        had     repeatedly            violated    that\n\nregulation in the past.\n\n              We thus hold that it was not an abuse of the ALJ's broad\n\ndiscretion to admit the DOT reports not as character evidence but\n\nboth    pursuant       to    the    \"[p]ublic       records         and   reports\"    hearsay\n\nexception and as proof of Petitioners' knowledge concerning their\n\nhistory of complying with the driving regulation. However, even if\n\nthe    ALJ    abused    its    discretion        here,        any    purported      error    was\n\nharmless in light of the other evidence against Petitioners, which\n\nwas substantial, as discussed in the next Part.                             See Mekhoukh v.\n\nAshcroft,      358     F.3d    118,    130       (1st    Cir.       2004)       (reviewing    an\n\nevidentiary        ruling      in     the    administrative               law    context     for\n\nharmlessness).\n\n              C.     The STAA Claim\n\n                        i.    Legal Framework\n\n              \"A prima facie case of unlawful termination under the\n\nSTAA requires a showing that the employee engaged in protected\n\nactivity, that the employee was subjected to adverse employment\n\naction,      and   that      there    was    a    causal       connection         between    the\n\nprotected activity and the adverse action.\"                          Clean Harbors Envtl.\n\nServs., Inc., 146 F.3d at 21.                \"If a complainant makes out a prima\n\nfacie case, the employer may rebut that showing with evidence of a\n\nlegitimate,        non-retaliatory          reason      for    the    adverse      employment\n\naction.       The burden then shifts back to the complainant to prove\n\n\n                                             -17-\n\fthat the proffered reason is actually a pretext for unlawful\n\nretaliation.\"    BSP Trans, Inc., 160 F.3d at 46; see also Day v.\n\nStaples, Inc., 555 F.3d 42, 53 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                   ii.   Analysis\n\n            Mailloux engaged in protected activity when he informed\n\nBeaudry on December 17, 2004, that he refused to exceed the driving\n\nregulation to make a particular delivery on time. Because Mailloux\n\nwas speaking to Beaudry, Petitioners knew of Mailloux's protected\n\nactivity.    Mailloux was then subjected to an adverse employment\n\naction when Beaudry terminated him during the same conversation.\n\nThese three ALJ findings are undisputed.       We thus consider whether\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the ARB's affirmance of the ALJ's\n\nconclusions that there was a causal connection between Mailloux's\n\nprotected activity and the adverse action against him, and that\n\nPetitioners' proffered reason for the adverse action was actually\n\na pretext for unlawful retaliation.        We find that such substantial\n\nevidence exists.\n\n            Petitioners argue that Mailloux failed to prove a causal\n\nconnection between his protected activity and termination.           In so\n\ndoing,   they   assert   that   substantial   evidence   in   the   record,\n\nincluding Beaudry's testimony, supports a determination that there\n\nwas a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for discharging Mailloux,\n\nand that the ARB erred in upholding the ALJ's contrary decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f           Petitioners submit that R&B diligently processes its\n\ndrivers' paperwork and relies heavily upon them to provide accurate\n\nand timely information regarding their hours of duty.           Petitioners\n\nalso contend that Mailloux, of his own accord and without informing\n\nR&B, falsified his data logs due to his bleak financial situation,\n\nbecause if he had followed the driving regulation, Mailloux would\n\nhave earned less money. Petitioners claim that R&B later uncovered\n\nthese violations and informed Mailloux of them in order to compel\n\nhim to conform to R&B's policy of requiring its drivers to comply\n\nwith the driving regulation.       Thus, Petitioners claim that, rather\n\nthan as a result of his protected activity, Mailloux was terminated\n\nfor a legitimate business purpose: because he refused to conform\n\nhis conduct to the company's standards of properly logging driving\n\ntime and keeping within the requirements of the driving regulation.\n\n           However,   the    ALJ   specifically    disbelieved       Beaudry's\n\ntestimony.   First, the ALJ found that Beaudry's testimony that R&B\n\nrequired its drivers to comply with the driving regulation was\n\nundermined by the DOT reports.          Second, the ALJ concluded that\n\nBeaudry was \"lying\" when he told Kidder that he had never received\n\nany   previous   citations    from    the   DOT   for   hours   of    service\n\nviolations.12    As the finder of fact and a witness to Beaudry's\n\n\n12\n   Although Kidder clarified on cross examination that Beaudry had\nactually said that he never violated the regulations –- not that he\nreceived no citations –- the ALJ's logic and conclusion here are\nstill valid: because Beaudry's payment of the fines constituted an\nadmission of the underlying violations, the testimony by Kidder on\n\n                                     -19-\n\ftestimony, the ALJ's \"credibility determinations are entitled to\n\ngreat deference.\"     See P. Gioioso & Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC, 115 F.3d\n\n100, 108 (1st Cir. 1997).      We have previously observed in another\n\ncase involving alleged retaliation when an employee engaged in\n\nprotected activity that a fact finder can find pretext for unlawful\n\ntermination where \"the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy\n\nof credence.\"     See McDonough v. City of Quincy, 452 F.3d 8, 18 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., 530\n\nU.S. 133, 143 (2000))(internal quotation marks omitted).             The ALJ\n\ncould thus find that Beaudry's testimony about Mailloux's on-the-\n\njob conduct was pretext for Mailloux's unlawful termination because\n\nthe ALJ had found Beaudry's proferred explanation to be unworthy of\n\ncredence.\n\n            Other evidence in the record further supports the ALJ's\n\nfinding that Mailloux's termination was on account of his protected\n\nactivity and not his non-compliance with the driving regulation.\n\nBagley testified that Petitioners were aware that their drivers\n\nexceeded    the   hours   allotted   by     the   driving   regulation,   and,\n\nfurther, that they expected their drivers to do so. Hill testified\n\nthat Petitioners regularly pressured their drivers to violate the\n\ndriving regulation.       Thus, based on the testimonies of Mailloux,\n\nBeaudry, Bagley, and Hill, and the DOT reports, we find that\n\n\n\nwhich the ALJ based the finding that Beaudry was lying did in fact\nsupport this finding.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fsubstantial evidence supports the findings that a causal connection\n\nexisted between Mailloux's protected activity and the adverse\n\nemployment action against him, and that Petitioners' proffered\n\nreason for terminating Mailloux was actually a pretext for unlawful\n\nretaliation.\n\n           D.    The Back Pay Award\n\n           The ALJ noted in its recommended decision and order that\n\nPetitioners \"have not challenged August 25, 2004 as [Mailloux's]\n\ninitial start date.\"     Moreover, the ALJ found that Mailloux began\n\nwork on August 25, 2004, based in part on an absence of any\n\nobjection from Petitioners.\n\n           The ARB found that, as the ALJ noted, R&B did not raise\n\nbefore the ALJ any issue regarding or dispute concerning the\n\ncalculation of Mailloux's back pay award.             Consequently, based on\n\nits precedent declining \"to consider issues or arguments raised for\n\nthe first time on appeal,\" the ARB declined to consider the matter,\n\nfinding both that R&B had waived this argument on appeal and that\n\nsubstantial evidence supported the ALJ's recommended back pay\n\naward.   As a result, the ARB affirmed the ALJ's recommended back\n\npay award.\n\n           Petitioners       argue   on   appeal   that     the   ALJ    erred   in\n\ndetermining that the start date of Mailloux's employment was\n\nAugust 25, 2004.       Petitioners contend that their post-hearing\n\nbrief,   which   the   ALJ    ordered     on   July   28,    2006,      and   which\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fPetitioners filed on October 30, 2006, specifically addressed the\n\nissue    of   damages,    and   established      Mailloux's     start   date   as\n\nAugust 7, 2004.\n\n              Petitioners did explicitly raise this matter in its post-\n\nhearing brief.     Under the \"Statement of All Issues\" in that brief,\n\nPetitioners claimed that Mailloux's employment with R&B spanned 133\n\ndays, which Petitioners reiterated in the \"Statement of Facts\"\n\nsection of that brief and noted was based on an initial start date\n\nof August 7, 2004.       However, despite the ALJ's instructions in its\n\nbriefing order and warning about waiver,13 this statement was\n\nunaccompanied by any argumentation in this brief and is also not\n\naddressed in any way in Petitioners' December 8, 2006, response to\n\nthe post-hearing reply brief.             Only on appeal do Petitioners\n\nproffer an argument for their proposed alternate start date:\n\nMailloux signed a receipt for his copy of the Federal Motor Carrier\n\nSafety    Regulations     Pocket   Book     on   that   date,   indicating     he\n\ncommenced employment then.          As Petitioners, despite the ALJ's\n\ninstructions and warning, did not specifically address in their\n\npost-hearing brief arguments concerning the back pay award, the\n\nARB's legal ruling that they waived the matter was not \"arbitrary,\n\n\n\n\n13\n   In its July 28, 2006 briefing order, the ALJ stated that each\nbrief shall include an argument \"addressing each issue in a\nseparately numbered section.\"    Furthermore, the ALJ noted that\n\"issues or arguments not specifically addressed in the brief will\nbe deemed to have been waived.\"\n\n                                     -22-\n\fcapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance\n\nwith law,\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).\n\n                         IV.    Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we deny review.\n\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f",

Mailloux sought relief under the employee protection provisions of Section 405 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (\"the STAA\"), 49 U.S.C. § 31105.<sup>[1]</sup> A final decision and order of the U.S. Department of Labor's Administrative Review Board (\"ARB\") determined that Mailloux's termination violated the STAA, and awarded backpay and other expenses. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Facts</i><sup>[2]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Mailloux's Employment</h2>\n<p>Beaudry owns two trucking companies, R &amp; B and Beaudry Enterprises. He also co-owns BAT Express, a third trucking company. These three entities share office space and drivers. Neither Beaudry Enterprises nor BAT Express is a party to this case.</p>\n<p>In late-August 2004, Petitioners hired Mailloux as a driver of a commercial motor carrier, an over-the-road truck, to deliver loads on routes between New England and Florida.<sup>[3]</sup> During the scope of his employment through December 17, 2004,<sup>[4]</sup> Mailloux reported to Heather Bagley (\"Bagley\"), who was Beaudry's administrative assistant, that it was not possible to make various deliveries on time without violating the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act, the Department of Transportation's (\"DOT\") hours of service regulation (the \"driving regulation\"), which restricts the number of hours drivers of commercial motor vehicles may work over a certain period of time. <i>See</i> 49 C.F.R. § 395.3(b)(2).<sup>[5]</sup> Bagley informed Mailloux that the deliveries had already been scheduled and could not be changed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> On December 17, 2004, Mailloux called Beaudry's home to inform Beaudry that he was unable to make a particular delivery from Florida on time both because he had a flat tire and because he had already driven the maximum allowable number of hours under the driving regulation. During this conversation, Beaudry told Mailloux to return the truck to R &amp; B's facility in New Hampshire and Beaudry would inquire about arranging for Mailloux to be transported back to Florida. Mailloux responded, \"I guess that means I'm fired.\" Beaudry said only \"get the truck back up here\" before the conversation ended. When Mailloux later spoke with a fellow R &amp; B driver, the driver told Mailloux \"yeah, you're fired.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. OSHA Investigation and Testimony Before the ALJ</h2>\n<p>On December 20, 2004,<sup>[6]</sup> Mailloux contacted the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") to report that he would soon be discharged from R &amp; B and wanted to speak to someone. The following day, Mailloux was, according to the ALJ, \"discharged.\"</p>\n<p>Later, on December 27, 2004, Mailloux met with Christine Kidder (\"Kidder\"), an OSHA investigator, and told her that during his employment with R &amp; B he was continually required to drive in excess of the driving regulation. During this interview, Mailloux informed Kidder that he routinely falsified his driving logs for R &amp; B in order to provide the appearance that he was in compliance with the driving regulation.</p>\n<p>After this initial interview with Mailloux, OSHA conducted an investigation of R &amp; B, including an interview with Beaudry. When Kidder contacted Beaudry, he informed her that he had fired Mailloux due to his inability to properly plan his trips, which were costing the company time and money. During this interview, Kidder inquired whether R &amp; B followed the driving regulation. Beaudry represented that he had never violated the driving regulation. Later, during the ALJ hearing, Beaudry testified that R &amp; B submits written notices to drivers whose driving logs are false or violate the driving regulation. Beaudry further testified that he submitted such notices to Mailloux and ultimately fired him because he was driving in excess of the maximum hours allowable by the driving regulation.</p>\n<p>Following her interview with Beaudry, Kidder contacted the DOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (\"FMCSA\") and obtained compliance reviews and enforcement reports relating to R &amp; B (\"the DOT reports\"). These reviews and reports are the investigative reports prepared by \"an agent\"<sup>[7]</sup> who visits a company to determine whether they are in compliance with the driving regulation. Based on an audit the FMCSA conducted of R &amp; B and on Kidder's own review of the DOT reports, Kidder learned that Beaudry and all three of the companies in which he had an interest had previously <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> been cited for violating the driving regulation.<sup>[8]</sup> The most recent DOT report, dated April 12, 2005, showed R &amp; B's violations of the driving regulation, as well as other DOT regulations, for the period August 23, 2004, to February 22, 2005, a time frame that included Mailloux's employment. Additionally, past DOT reports showed that R &amp; B and the other two trucking companies in which Beaudry had an interest had previously been cited for violations on September 14, 2000; January 22, 2001; and June 14, 2001. Petitioners paid civil penalties associated with some of these violations.</p>\n<p>As part of Kidder's investigation, she also interviewed Bagley, who informed her that R &amp; B drivers routinely violated the driving regulation because they often could not otherwise complete their trips on time. Bagley stated that drivers would complain to her about driving in excess of the regulation, and the company consequently experienced high turnover. Bagley later testified to the ALJ in a deposition that when she hired drivers and they inquired about compliance with the driving regulation, she would tell them that the company complied with the regulation, even though she knew Beaudry would soon have them driving in excess of it. Bagley also testified to the ALJ that Trish Patrick, Beaudry's daughter and employee, instructed Bagley to separate toll receipts from a truck driver's time log when they did not match in order to conceal violations of the driving regulation.</p>\n<p>Scott Hill (\"Hill\"), another R &amp; B driver, testified about his experience working for Petitioners. Like Mailloux, Hill worked for R &amp; B from August 2004 until December 2004. Hill testified that, during his employment with Petitioners, he consistently made deliveries in excess of the driving regulation. Hill stated that he falsified his driving logs to make it appear as if he were driving within the legal limitations. Hill further testified that Beaudry met with him about his violations, and used Mapquest to illustrate how a driver could make his deliveries on time and still comply with the driving regulation. Hill also testified that Beaudry suggested that when Hill was driving in Florida he could log his driving hours as a local delivery, even though it was an interstate one. Hill additionally testified that he brought up the driving regulation issue with Beaudry. Hill stated he told Beaudry at one point that he needed \"a break, I got to slow down, I want to run legal,\" and that Beaudry responded that he had \"other drivers that will run.\" Hill testified that he stopped working for R &amp; B on December 30, 2004, because he was exhausted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Procedural History</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. OSHA Findings and Petitioners' Appeal (2006)</h2>\n<p>On January 9, 2006, OSHA issued its findings. OSHA determined that Petitioners violated the STAA by discharging Mailloux after his complaint to Petitioners regarding his work hours. OSHA ordered Petitioners to pay Mailloux back wages from December 26, 2004, through February 27, 2005, the date on which he commenced his new employment.</p>\n<p>The same day OSHA issued its findings, Petitioners appealed OSHA's order to the ALJ. Petitioners argued that Mailloux was terminated for performing poorly, violating the driving regulation, and failing to communicate with the company's dispatcher in a timely manner.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> B. ALJ's Recommended Decision and Order (2007)</h2>\n<p>Following a hearing, the ALJ issued a recommended decision and order on June 8, 2007. The ALJ observed that the DOT reports revealed that R &amp; B's violations of the driving regulation existed before, during, and after Mailloux's employment with the company. The ALJ noted that the DOT reports suggested a pattern of violations associated with R &amp; B's day-to-day operations. Additionally, the ALJ relied on these records and other evidence to find that Mailloux was terminated in violation of the STAA. The ALJ concluded that Mailloux was entitled to relief, which included reinstatement and compensatory damages, such as back pay, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 31105(b)(3)(A).<sup>[9]</sup> Because Mailloux was not seeking reinstatement, the ALJ granted him back pay from December 17, 2004, the date of his termination, to February 27, 2005, when he obtained new employment, as well as travel expenses associated with the litigation. The ALJ's order suggested that Petitioners compensate Mailloux in the amount of $9,946.80 plus interest for back pay,<sup>[10]</sup> and $314.58 for reimbursed travel expenses. Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1978.109(a), the ALJ's recommendation was automatically forwarded for review to the ARB.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. ARB's Final Decision and Order (2009)</h2>\n<p>On June 26, 2009, the ARB issued its final decision and order. The ARB affirmed the recommendation by the ALJ and ruled that Mailloux had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he had engaged in a protected activity (when Mailloux informed Beaudry during the December 17, 2004, telephone conversation that Mailloux could not complete the delivery then assigned to him without violating the driving regulation), that R &amp; B was aware of the protected activity, and that R &amp; B took an adverse employment action (the December 17, 2004, termination) against Mailloux because of it.</p>\n<p>The ARB held that substantial evidence on the record supported the ALJ's factual findings, and that those findings were conclusive. The ARB also held that the ALJ did not abuse its discretion in admitting the DOT reports to which Kidder and a DOT representative testified, and that these reports were reliable indicators of R &amp; B's actual violations of the driving regulation. Additionally, the ARB found that there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ's finding that R &amp; B required its drivers to drive in excess of the driving regulation and that its drivers were not disciplined for hours of service violations. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> Furthermore, the ARB found substantial evidence in the record, including the fact that Beaudry did not have Mailloux's driver's log record indicating a violation of the driving regulation at the time he terminated him, to support the ALJ's finding of a causal connection between Mailloux's protected activity and his termination.</p>\n<p>Petitioners had also argued that the ALJ erred in calculating Mailloux's daily average wage rate with R &amp; B, asserting that Mailloux's actual start date was August 7, 2004, which, if used instead of August 25, 2004, would reduce his award for the 72-day period during which he was unemployed because it would increase the total number of days he worked and thus decrease his daily average wage rate. Nevertheless, because the ARB found that R &amp; B did not properly raise this issue before the ALJ, the ARB declined to consider the issue on appeal and affirmed the recommended award.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Petition for Judicial Review (2009)</h2>\n<p>In August 2009, R &amp; B and Beaudry timely petitioned this court to review the ARB's final decision and order. Petitioners' petition raises three issues. They argue that (1) evidence that R &amp; B and other trucking companies owned by Beaudry had violated DOT regulations was improperly admitted by the ALJ into evidence; (2) the ARB erroneously upheld the ALJ's decision that a causal connection existed between Mailloux's protected activity and the adverse employment action against him; and (3) the ARB erred in finding that substantial evidence existed in the record to justify the ALJ's decision regarding back pay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>\"We review the ARB's final decision in accordance with the dictates of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.\" <i>Clean Harbors Envtl. Servs., Inc. v. Herman,</i> 146 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1998). \"The ARB's decision must be affirmed unless its legal conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law, or its factual conclusions are unsupported by substantial evidence.\" <i>Id.; see also</i> 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(\"The reviewing court shall ... hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; ... [or] (E) unsupported by substantial evidence....\"). \"Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" <i>BSP Trans, Inc. v. United States Dep't of Labor,</i> 160 F.3d 38, 47 (1st Cir.1998)(quoting <i>NLRB v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co.,</i> 306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The DOT Reports</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>i. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>Since whether the ARB properly affirmed the ALJ's decision to admit the DOT reports is an evidentiary ruling, we review it for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 515 F.3d 74, 84 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Curtin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</i> 846 F.2d 1373, 1378-79 (Fed.Cir. 1988); <i>see also Barker v. Admin. Review Bd.,</i> 302 Fed.Appx. 248, 249 (5th Cir. 2008)(\"An ALJ is granted broad discretion to make evidentiary determinations.\"). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when a relevant factor deserving significant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> weight is overlooked, or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight, or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors, but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.\" <i>United States v. DeCicco,</i> 370 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir.2004) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ii. Legal Framework</h2>\n<p>The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in APA proceedings. Instead, the rules of evidence in administrative hearings before an ALJ provide, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote>[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, <i>knowledge,</i> identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p>29 C.F.R. § 18.404(b) (emphasis added). These rules of evidence also provide the following hearsay exception, concerning \"[p]ublic records and reports\": \"Records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth ... [f]actual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\" 29 C.F.R. § 18.803(a)(8).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>iii. Analysis</h2>\n<p>The ARB held that the ALJ did not abuse its discretion in admitting the DOT reports, considering them within the \"[p]ublic records and reports\" hearsay exception and \"only to the extent that they reflect R &amp; B's knowledge of its obligations pursuant to the hours of service regulations.\" Petitioners argue that the ALJ improperly relied on the DOT reports as highly prejudicial character evidence that showed, besides R &amp; B's knowledge of its legal obligations, which Petitioners claim was undisputed, that R &amp; B was acting in conformity with its past violations of the driving regulation. Respondent counters that the DOT reports were properly admitted as \"[p]ublic records and reports\" and to show Beaudry's motive and knowledge in terminating Mailloux's employment.</p>\n<p>First, Petitioners do not dispute that the DOT reports are \"[f]actual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law.\" Petitioners do contend, however, that the DOT reports \"indicate lack of trustworthiness.\" In making this claim, Petitioners cite to a New Jersey Superior Court case from 1988 that quotes a 1985 opinion from the Fifth Circuit stating that \"OSHA citations are the opinions of investigators and ordinarily do not `carry with [them] the indicia of reliability that is inherent in government adopted safety standards.'\" <i>Millison v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 226 N.J.Super. 572, 545 A.2d 213, 224 (1988)(alteration in original) (quoting <i>Dixon v. Int'l Harvester Co.,</i> 754 F.2d 573, 581 n. 5 (5th Cir.1985)). In any event, as the ARB observed, R &amp; B paid the penalties imposed by the DOT as a result of the admitted reports, the terms of which explicitly stated that such payments \"constitute admission of the violation(s).\" These admissions bolstered the trustworthiness of the DOT reports, supporting the ALJ's consideration of the reports as being within its discretion.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> Second, Beaudry's knowledge in discharging Mailloux is, as discussed in Part III.C., relevant to the instant case. The DOT reports suggested that Beaudry knew or should have known of the driving regulation and R &amp; B's failure to comply with it in the past. The DOT reports indicated that Beaudry knew or should have known he was not telling the truth when he told Kidder that he had never violated the driving regulation, which undermined his credibility when testifying. The Ninth Circuit has observed that, \"[w]hen offered to prove knowledge, ... the prior act need not be similar to the charged act as long as the prior act was one which would tend to make the existence of the defendant's knowledge more probable than it would be without the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Ramirez-Jiminez,</i> 967 F.2d 1321, 1326 (9th Cir.1992). Here, the prior acts of Petitioners were their violations of the driving regulation. These acts would certainly be relevant as tending to show that Petitioners were aware of their obligations under the driving regulation, that their employees were supposed to comply with it, and that Petitioners had repeatedly violated that regulation in the past.</p>\n<p>We thus hold that it was not an abuse of the ALJ's broad discretion to admit the DOT reports not as character evidence but both pursuant to the \"[p]ublic records and reports\" hearsay exception and as proof of Petitioners' knowledge concerning their history of complying with the driving regulation. However, even if the ALJ abused its discretion here, any purported error was harmless in light of the other evidence against Petitioners, which was substantial, as discussed in the next Part. <i>See </i><i>Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft,</i> 358 F.3d 118, 130 (1st Cir.2004) (reviewing an evidentiary ruling in the administrative law context for harmlessness).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The STAA Claim</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>i. Legal Framework</h2>\n<p>\"A prima facie case of unlawful termination under the STAA requires a showing that the employee engaged in protected activity, that the employee was subjected to adverse employment action, and that there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\" <i>Clean Harbors Envtl. Servs., Inc.,</i> 146 F.3d at 21. \"If a complainant makes out a prima facie case, the employer may rebut that showing with evidence of a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. The burden then shifts back to the complainant to prove that the proffered reason is actually a pretext for unlawful retaliation.\" <i>BSP Trans, Inc.,</i> 160 F.3d at 46; <i>see also </i><i>Day v. Staples, Inc.,</i> 555 F.3d 42, 53 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ii. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Mailloux engaged in protected activity when he informed Beaudry on December 17, 2004, that he refused to exceed the driving regulation to make a particular delivery on time. Because Mailloux was speaking to Beaudry, Petitioners knew of Mailloux's protected activity. Mailloux was then subjected to an adverse employment action when Beaudry terminated him during the same conversation. These three ALJ findings are undisputed. We thus consider whether substantial evidence supports the ARB's affirmance of the ALJ's conclusions that there was a causal connection between Mailloux's protected activity and the adverse action against <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> him, and that Petitioners' proffered reason for the adverse action was actually a pretext for unlawful retaliation. We find that such substantial evidence exists.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that Mailloux failed to prove a causal connection between his protected activity and termination. In so doing, they assert that substantial evidence in the record, including Beaudry's testimony, supports a determination that there was a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for discharging Mailloux, and that the ARB erred in upholding the ALJ's contrary decision.</p>\n<p>Petitioners submit that R &amp; B diligently processes its drivers' paperwork and relies heavily upon them to provide accurate and timely information regarding their hours of duty. Petitioners also contend that Mailloux, of his own accord and without informing R &amp; B, falsified his data logs due to his bleak financial situation, because if he had followed the driving regulation, Mailloux would have earned less money. Petitioners claim that R &amp; B later uncovered these violations and informed Mailloux of them in order to compel him to conform to R &amp; B's policy of requiring its drivers to comply with the driving regulation. Thus, Petitioners claim that, rather than as a result of his protected activity, Mailloux was terminated for a legitimate business purpose: because he refused to conform his conduct to the company's standards of properly logging driving time and keeping within the requirements of the driving regulation.</p>\n<p>However, the ALJ specifically disbelieved Beaudry's testimony. First, the ALJ found that Beaudry's testimony that R &amp; B required its drivers to comply with the driving regulation was undermined by the DOT reports. Second, the ALJ concluded that Beaudry was \"lying\" when he told Kidder that he had never received any previous citations from the DOT for hours of service violations.<sup>[12]</sup> As the finder of fact and a witness to Beaudry's testimony, the ALJ's \"credibility determinations are entitled to great deference.\" <i>See </i><i>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC,</i> 115 F.3d 100, 108 (1st Cir.1997). We have previously observed in another case involving alleged retaliation when an employee engaged in protected activity that a fact finder can find pretext for unlawful termination where \"the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\" <i>See </i><i>McDonough v. City of Quincy,</i> 452 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000))(internal quotation marks omitted). The ALJ could thus find that Beaudry's testimony about Mailloux's on-the-job conduct was pretext for Mailloux's unlawful termination because the ALJ had found Beaudry's proferred explanation to be unworthy of credence.</p>\n<p>Other evidence in the record further supports the ALJ's finding that Mailloux's termination was on account of his protected activity and not his non-compliance with the driving regulation. Bagley testified that Petitioners were aware that their drivers exceeded the hours allotted by the driving regulation, and, further, that they expected their drivers to do so. Hill testified that Petitioners regularly pressured their drivers to violate the driving regulation. Thus, based on the testimonies of Mailloux, Beaudry, Bagley, and Hill, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> the DOT reports, we find that substantial evidence supports the findings that a causal connection existed between Mailloux's protected activity and the adverse employment action against him, and that Petitioners' proffered reason for terminating Mailloux was actually a pretext for unlawful retaliation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. The Back Pay Award</h2>\n<p>The ALJ noted in its recommended decision and order that Petitioners \"have not challenged August 25, 2004 as [Mailloux's] initial start date.\" Moreover, the ALJ found that Mailloux began work on August 25, 2004, based in part on an absence of any objection from Petitioners.</p>\n<p>The ARB found that, as the ALJ noted, R &amp; B did not raise before the ALJ any issue regarding or dispute concerning the calculation of Mailloux's back pay award. Consequently, based on its precedent declining \"to consider issues or arguments raised for the first time on appeal,\" the ARB declined to consider the matter, finding <i>both</i> that R &amp; B had waived this argument on appeal and that substantial evidence supported the ALJ's recommended back pay award. As a result, the ARB affirmed the ALJ's recommended back pay award.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue on appeal that the ALJ erred in determining that the start date of Mailloux's employment was August 25, 2004. Petitioners contend that their post-hearing brief, which the ALJ ordered on July 28, 2006, and which Petitioners filed on October 30, 2006, specifically addressed the issue of damages, and established Mailloux's start date as August 7, 2004.</p>\n<p>Petitioners did explicitly raise this matter in its post-hearing brief. Under the \"Statement of All Issues\" in that brief, Petitioners claimed that Mailloux's employment with R &amp; B spanned 133 days, which Petitioners reiterated in the \"Statement of Facts\" section of that brief and noted was based on an initial start date of August 7, 2004. However, despite the ALJ's instructions in its briefing order and warning about waiver,<sup>[13]</sup> this statement was unaccompanied by any argumentation in this brief and is also not addressed in any way in Petitioners' December 8, 2006, response to the post-hearing reply brief. Only on appeal do Petitioners proffer an argument for their proposed alternate start date: Mailloux signed a receipt for his copy of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations Pocket Book on that date, indicating he commenced employment then. As Petitioners, despite the ALJ's instructions and warning, did not specifically address in their post-hearing brief arguments concerning the back pay award, the ARB's legal ruling that they waived the matter was not \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we deny review.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The STAA prohibits employers from taking adverse employment actions against employees, including drivers of commercial motor vehicles, who engage in certain protected activities. 49 U.S.C. § 31105(j). Specifically, the STAA provides, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>\n<p>(1) A person may not discharge an employee, or discipline or discriminate against an employee regarding pay, terms, or privileges of employment, because</p>\n<p>(A)(i) the employee, or another person at the employee's request, has filed a complaint or begun a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety or security regulation, standard, or order, or has testified or will testify in such a proceeding ...</p>\n<p>(B) the employee refuses to operate a vehicle because</p>\n<p>(i) the operation violates a regulation, standard, or order of the United States related to commercial motor vehicle safety, health, or security....</p>\n<p>49 U.S.C. § 31105(a)(1)(A)(i)-(B)(i).</p>\n<p>[2]  These facts are drawn from the factual findings of the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), which the ARB affirmed.</p>\n<p>[3]  Mailloux's exact start date is disputed and germane to the back pay issue, which Petitioners raise in this petition. <i>See infra</i> Part III.D.</p>\n<p>[4]  The ALJ found that Mailloux was fired on December 17, 2004, a finding the ARB affirmed and is uncontested on appeal. Notwithstanding the ALJ's finding that Mailloux was \"discharged\" on December 21, 2004, and OSHA's order to Petitioners to pay Mailloux back wages from December 26, 2004, we thus adopt December 17, 2004, as Mailloux's undisputed termination date.</p>\n<p>[5]  49 C.F.R. § 395.3(b)(2) provides, in full:\n</p>\n<p>(b) No motor carrier shall permit or require a driver of a property-carrying commercial motor vehicle to drive, nor shall any driver drive a property-carrying commercial motor vehicle, regardless of the number of motor carriers using the driver's services, for any period after ...</p>\n<p>(2) Having been on duty 70 hours in any period of 8 consecutive days if the employing motor carrier operates commercial motor vehicles every day of the week.</p>\n<p>[6]  The recommended decision and order of the ALJ indicates that Mailloux initially called the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") investigator on \"December 20, 2005,\" and that the investigator conducted the interview with Mailloux on \"December 27, 2005.\" However, it is clear from the record that these events occurred on their respective dates in 2004.</p>\n<p>[7]  The record does not indicate what sort of \"agent\" conducted this investigation.</p>\n<p>[8]  The fact that these three companies share office space and drivers is, according to testimony the Division Administrator of the DOT's FMCSA provided to the ALJ, the reason their compliance with the driving regulation was jointly reviewed.</p>\n<p>[9]  49 U.S.C. § 31105(b)(3)(A), concerning \"Filing complaints and procedures,\" provides, in full:\n</p>\n<p>(3)(A) If the Secretary of Labor decides, on the basis of a complaint, a person violated subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Labor shall order the person to</p>\n<p>(i) take affirmative action to abate the violation;</p>\n<p>(ii) reinstate the complainant to the former position with the same pay and terms and privileges of employment; and</p>\n<p>(iii) pay compensatory damages, including backpay with interest and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p>[10]  The ALJ calculated this wage rate loss using the following figures. Mailloux worked for a total of 108 days between his start date on August 25, 2004, and his end date on December 17, 2004. During that time, he earned $14,919.66, which, when divided by 108, yielded a daily wage rate of $138.15. Given that Mailloux was out of work for 72 days between his end date with R &amp; B and the start date of his new employment on February 27, 2005, his daily wage of $138.15 multiplied by 72 days out of work yielded the $9,946.80 wage rate loss.</p>\n<p>[11]  Petitioners argue that their payment of the DOT penalties should not be taken as an admission of the underlying violations because, Petitioners claim, they paid the penalties merely \"in an effort to avoid litigation and to resolve the outstanding disputes.\" This argument is unavailing because Petitioners' reason for paying the penalties is irrelevant to their constructive admission.</p>\n<p>[12]  Although Kidder clarified on cross examination that Beaudry had actually said that he never violated the regulationsnot that he received no citationsthe ALJ's logic and conclusion here are still valid: because Beaudry's payment of the fines constituted an admission of the underlying violations, the testimony by Kidder on which the ALJ based the finding that Beaudry was lying did in fact support this finding.</p>\n<p>[13]  In its July 28, 2006 briefing order, the ALJ stated that each brief shall include an argument \"addressing each issue in a separately numbered section.\" Furthermore, the ALJ noted that \"issues or arguments not specifically addressed in the brief will be deemed to have been waived.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

Mailloux sought relief under the employee protection provisions of Section 405 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (\"the STAA\"), 49 U.S.C. § 31105.<sup>[1]</sup> A final decision and order of the U.S. Department of Labor's Administrative Review Board (\"ARB\") determined that Mailloux's termination violated the STAA, and awarded backpay and other expenses. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Facts</i><sup>[2]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Mailloux's Employment</h2>\n<p>Beaudry owns two trucking companies, R &amp; B and Beaudry Enterprises. He also co-owns BAT Express, a third trucking company. These three entities share office space and drivers. Neither Beaudry Enterprises nor BAT Express is a party to this case.</p>\n<p>In late-August 2004, Petitioners hired Mailloux as a driver of a commercial motor carrier, an over-the-road truck, to deliver loads on routes between New England and Florida.<sup>[3]</sup> During the scope of his employment through December 17, 2004,<sup>[4]</sup> Mailloux reported to Heather Bagley (\"Bagley\"), who was Beaudry's administrative assistant, that it was not possible to make various deliveries on time without violating the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act, the Department of Transportation's (\"DOT\") hours of service regulation (the \"driving regulation\"), which restricts the number of hours drivers of commercial motor vehicles may work over a certain period of time. <i>See</i> 49 C.F.R. § 395.3(b)(2).<sup>[5]</sup> Bagley informed Mailloux that the deliveries had already been scheduled and could not be changed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> On December 17, 2004, Mailloux called Beaudry's home to inform Beaudry that he was unable to make a particular delivery from Florida on time both because he had a flat tire and because he had already driven the maximum allowable number of hours under the driving regulation. During this conversation, Beaudry told Mailloux to return the truck to R &amp; B's facility in New Hampshire and Beaudry would inquire about arranging for Mailloux to be transported back to Florida. Mailloux responded, \"I guess that means I'm fired.\" Beaudry said only \"get the truck back up here\" before the conversation ended. When Mailloux later spoke with a fellow R &amp; B driver, the driver told Mailloux \"yeah, you're fired.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. OSHA Investigation and Testimony Before the ALJ</h2>\n<p>On December 20, 2004,<sup>[6]</sup> Mailloux contacted the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") to report that he would soon be discharged from R &amp; B and wanted to speak to someone. The following day, Mailloux was, according to the ALJ, \"discharged.\"</p>\n<p>Later, on December 27, 2004, Mailloux met with Christine Kidder (\"Kidder\"), an OSHA investigator, and told her that during his employment with R &amp; B he was continually required to drive in excess of the driving regulation. During this interview, Mailloux informed Kidder that he routinely falsified his driving logs for R &amp; B in order to provide the appearance that he was in compliance with the driving regulation.</p>\n<p>After this initial interview with Mailloux, OSHA conducted an investigation of R &amp; B, including an interview with Beaudry. When Kidder contacted Beaudry, he informed her that he had fired Mailloux due to his inability to properly plan his trips, which were costing the company time and money. During this interview, Kidder inquired whether R &amp; B followed the driving regulation. Beaudry represented that he had never violated the driving regulation. Later, during the ALJ hearing, Beaudry testified that R &amp; B submits written notices to drivers whose driving logs are false or violate the driving regulation. Beaudry further testified that he submitted such notices to Mailloux and ultimately fired him because he was driving in excess of the maximum hours allowable by the driving regulation.</p>\n<p>Following her interview with Beaudry, Kidder contacted the DOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (\"FMCSA\") and obtained compliance reviews and enforcement reports relating to R &amp; B (\"the DOT reports\"). These reviews and reports are the investigative reports prepared by \"an agent\"<sup>[7]</sup> who visits a company to determine whether they are in compliance with the driving regulation. Based on an audit the FMCSA conducted of R &amp; B and on Kidder's own review of the DOT reports, Kidder learned that Beaudry and all three of the companies in which he had an interest had previously <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> been cited for violating the driving regulation.<sup>[8]</sup> The most recent DOT report, dated April 12, 2005, showed R &amp; B's violations of the driving regulation, as well as other DOT regulations, for the period August 23, 2004, to February 22, 2005, a time frame that included Mailloux's employment. Additionally, past DOT reports showed that R &amp; B and the other two trucking companies in which Beaudry had an interest had previously been cited for violations on September 14, 2000; January 22, 2001; and June 14, 2001. Petitioners paid civil penalties associated with some of these violations.</p>\n<p>As part of Kidder's investigation, she also interviewed Bagley, who informed her that R &amp; B drivers routinely violated the driving regulation because they often could not otherwise complete their trips on time. Bagley stated that drivers would complain to her about driving in excess of the regulation, and the company consequently experienced high turnover. Bagley later testified to the ALJ in a deposition that when she hired drivers and they inquired about compliance with the driving regulation, she would tell them that the company complied with the regulation, even though she knew Beaudry would soon have them driving in excess of it. Bagley also testified to the ALJ that Trish Patrick, Beaudry's daughter and employee, instructed Bagley to separate toll receipts from a truck driver's time log when they did not match in order to conceal violations of the driving regulation.</p>\n<p>Scott Hill (\"Hill\"), another R &amp; B driver, testified about his experience working for Petitioners. Like Mailloux, Hill worked for R &amp; B from August 2004 until December 2004. Hill testified that, during his employment with Petitioners, he consistently made deliveries in excess of the driving regulation. Hill stated that he falsified his driving logs to make it appear as if he were driving within the legal limitations. Hill further testified that Beaudry met with him about his violations, and used Mapquest to illustrate how a driver could make his deliveries on time and still comply with the driving regulation. Hill also testified that Beaudry suggested that when Hill was driving in Florida he could log his driving hours as a local delivery, even though it was an interstate one. Hill additionally testified that he brought up the driving regulation issue with Beaudry. Hill stated he told Beaudry at one point that he needed \"a break, I got to slow down, I want to run legal,\" and that Beaudry responded that he had \"other drivers that will run.\" Hill testified that he stopped working for R &amp; B on December 30, 2004, because he was exhausted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Procedural History</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. OSHA Findings and Petitioners' Appeal (2006)</h2>\n<p>On January 9, 2006, OSHA issued its findings. OSHA determined that Petitioners violated the STAA by discharging Mailloux after his complaint to Petitioners regarding his work hours. OSHA ordered Petitioners to pay Mailloux back wages from December 26, 2004, through February 27, 2005, the date on which he commenced his new employment.</p>\n<p>The same day OSHA issued its findings, Petitioners appealed OSHA's order to the ALJ. Petitioners argued that Mailloux was terminated for performing poorly, violating the driving regulation, and failing to communicate with the company's dispatcher in a timely manner.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> B. ALJ's Recommended Decision and Order (2007)</h2>\n<p>Following a hearing, the ALJ issued a recommended decision and order on June 8, 2007. The ALJ observed that the DOT reports revealed that R &amp; B's violations of the driving regulation existed before, during, and after Mailloux's employment with the company. The ALJ noted that the DOT reports suggested a pattern of violations associated with R &amp; B's day-to-day operations. Additionally, the ALJ relied on these records and other evidence to find that Mailloux was terminated in violation of the STAA. The ALJ concluded that Mailloux was entitled to relief, which included reinstatement and compensatory damages, such as back pay, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 31105(b)(3)(A).<sup>[9]</sup> Because Mailloux was not seeking reinstatement, the ALJ granted him back pay from December 17, 2004, the date of his termination, to February 27, 2005, when he obtained new employment, as well as travel expenses associated with the litigation. The ALJ's order suggested that Petitioners compensate Mailloux in the amount of $9,946.80 plus interest for back pay,<sup>[10]</sup> and $314.58 for reimbursed travel expenses. Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1978.109(a), the ALJ's recommendation was automatically forwarded for review to the ARB.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. ARB's Final Decision and Order (2009)</h2>\n<p>On June 26, 2009, the ARB issued its final decision and order. The ARB affirmed the recommendation by the ALJ and ruled that Mailloux had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he had engaged in a protected activity (when Mailloux informed Beaudry during the December 17, 2004, telephone conversation that Mailloux could not complete the delivery then assigned to him without violating the driving regulation), that R &amp; B was aware of the protected activity, and that R &amp; B took an adverse employment action (the December 17, 2004, termination) against Mailloux because of it.</p>\n<p>The ARB held that substantial evidence on the record supported the ALJ's factual findings, and that those findings were conclusive. The ARB also held that the ALJ did not abuse its discretion in admitting the DOT reports to which Kidder and a DOT representative testified, and that these reports were reliable indicators of R &amp; B's actual violations of the driving regulation. Additionally, the ARB found that there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ's finding that R &amp; B required its drivers to drive in excess of the driving regulation and that its drivers were not disciplined for hours of service violations. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> Furthermore, the ARB found substantial evidence in the record, including the fact that Beaudry did not have Mailloux's driver's log record indicating a violation of the driving regulation at the time he terminated him, to support the ALJ's finding of a causal connection between Mailloux's protected activity and his termination.</p>\n<p>Petitioners had also argued that the ALJ erred in calculating Mailloux's daily average wage rate with R &amp; B, asserting that Mailloux's actual start date was August 7, 2004, which, if used instead of August 25, 2004, would reduce his award for the 72-day period during which he was unemployed because it would increase the total number of days he worked and thus decrease his daily average wage rate. Nevertheless, because the ARB found that R &amp; B did not properly raise this issue before the ALJ, the ARB declined to consider the issue on appeal and affirmed the recommended award.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Petition for Judicial Review (2009)</h2>\n<p>In August 2009, R &amp; B and Beaudry timely petitioned this court to review the ARB's final decision and order. Petitioners' petition raises three issues. They argue that (1) evidence that R &amp; B and other trucking companies owned by Beaudry had violated DOT regulations was improperly admitted by the ALJ into evidence; (2) the ARB erroneously upheld the ALJ's decision that a causal connection existed between Mailloux's protected activity and the adverse employment action against him; and (3) the ARB erred in finding that substantial evidence existed in the record to justify the ALJ's decision regarding back pay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>\"We review the ARB's final decision in accordance with the dictates of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.\" <i>Clean Harbors Envtl.

Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>Since whether the ARB properly affirmed the ALJ's decision to admit the DOT reports is an evidentiary ruling, we review it for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Richardson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203173\"><a href=\"/opinion/203173/united-states-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Curtin v.

Legal Framework</h2>\n<p>The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in APA proceedings. Instead, the rules of evidence in administrative hearings before an ALJ provide, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote>[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, <i>knowledge,</i> identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p>29 C.F.R. § 18.404(b) (emphasis added). These rules of evidence also provide the following hearsay exception, concerning \"[p]ublic records and reports\": \"Records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth ... [f]actual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\" 29 C.F.R. § 18.803(a)(8).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>iii. Analysis</h2>\n<p>The ARB held that the ALJ did not abuse its discretion in admitting the DOT reports, considering them within the \"[p]ublic records and reports\" hearsay exception and \"only to the extent that they reflect R &amp; B's knowledge of its obligations pursuant to the hours of service regulations.\" Petitioners argue that the ALJ improperly relied on the DOT reports as highly prejudicial character evidence that showed, besides R &amp; B's knowledge of its legal obligations, which Petitioners claim was undisputed, that R &amp; B was acting in conformity with its past violations of the driving regulation. Respondent counters that the DOT reports were properly admitted as \"[p]ublic records and reports\" and to show Beaudry's motive and knowledge in terminating Mailloux's employment.</p>\n<p>First, Petitioners do not dispute that the DOT reports are \"[f]actual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law.\" Petitioners do contend, however, that the DOT reports \"indicate lack of trustworthiness.\" In making this claim, Petitioners cite to a New Jersey Superior Court case from 1988 that quotes a 1985 opinion from the Fifth Circuit stating that \"OSHA citations are the opinions of investigators and ordinarily do not `carry with [them] the indicia of reliability that is inherent in government adopted safety standards.'\" <i>Millison v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 226 N.J.Super. 572, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525336\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525336/millison-v-ei-du-pont-de-nemours/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 224 (1988)(alteration in original) (quoting <i>Dixon v. Int'l Harvester Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"447864\"><a href=\"/opinion/447864/mary-lou-clark-dixon-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-charlie-dixon-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">754</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 581 n. 5 (5th Cir.1985)). In any event, as the ARB observed, R &amp; B paid the penalties imposed by the DOT as a result of the admitted reports, the terms of which explicitly stated that such payments \"constitute admission of the violation(s).\" These admissions bolstered the trustworthiness of the DOT reports, supporting the ALJ's consideration of the reports as being within its discretion.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> Second, Beaudry's knowledge in discharging Mailloux is, as discussed in Part III.C., relevant to the instant case. The DOT reports suggested that Beaudry knew or should have known of the driving regulation and R &amp; B's failure to comply with it in the past. The DOT reports indicated that Beaudry knew or should have known he was not telling the truth when he told Kidder that he had never violated the driving regulation, which undermined his credibility when testifying. The Ninth Circuit has observed that, \"[w]hen offered to prove knowledge, ... the prior act need not be similar to the charged act as long as the prior act was one which would tend to make the existence of the defendant's knowledge more probable than it would be without the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Ramirez-Jiminez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585875\"><a href=\"/opinion/585875/united-states-v-hector-ramirez-jiminez/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1321</span></a></span>, 1326 (9th Cir.1992). Here, the prior acts of Petitioners were their violations of the driving regulation. These acts would certainly be relevant as tending to show that Petitioners were aware of their obligations under the driving regulation, that their employees were supposed to comply with it, and that Petitioners had repeatedly violated that regulation in the past.</p>\n<p>We thus hold that it was not an abuse of the ALJ's broad discretion to admit the DOT reports not as character evidence but both pursuant to the \"[p]ublic records and reports\" hearsay exception and as proof of Petitioners' knowledge concerning their history of complying with the driving regulation. However, even if the ALJ abused its discretion here, any purported error was harmless in light of the other evidence against Petitioners, which was substantial, as discussed in the next Part. <i>See </i><i>Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200854\"><a href=\"/opinion/200854/mekhoukh-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.2004) (reviewing an evidentiary ruling in the administrative law context for harmlessness).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The STAA Claim</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>i. Legal Framework</h2>\n<p>\"A prima facie case of unlawful termination under the STAA requires a showing that the employee engaged in protected activity, that the employee was subjected to adverse employment action, and that there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\" <i>Clean Harbors Envtl. Servs., Inc.,</i> 146 F.3d at 21. \"If a complainant makes out a prima facie case, the employer may rebut that showing with evidence of a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. The burden then shifts back to the complainant to prove that the proffered reason is actually a pretext for unlawful retaliation.\" <i>BSP Trans, Inc.,</i> 160 F.3d at 46; <i>see also </i><i>Day v. Staples, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203660\"><a href=\"/opinion/203660/day-v-staples-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ii. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Mailloux engaged in protected activity when he informed Beaudry on December 17, 2004, that he refused to exceed the driving regulation to make a particular delivery on time. Because Mailloux was speaking to Beaudry, Petitioners knew of Mailloux's protected activity. Mailloux was then subjected to an adverse employment action when Beaudry terminated him during the same conversation. These three ALJ findings are undisputed. We thus consider whether substantial evidence supports the ARB's affirmance of the ALJ's conclusions that there was a causal connection between Mailloux's protected activity and the adverse action against <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> him, and that Petitioners' proffered reason for the adverse action was actually a pretext for unlawful retaliation. We find that such substantial evidence exists.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that Mailloux failed to prove a causal connection between his protected activity and termination. In so doing, they assert that substantial evidence in the record, including Beaudry's testimony, supports a determination that there was a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for discharging Mailloux, and that the ARB erred in upholding the ALJ's contrary decision.</p>\n<p>Petitioners submit that R &amp; B diligently processes its drivers' paperwork and relies heavily upon them to provide accurate and timely information regarding their hours of duty. Petitioners also contend that Mailloux, of his own accord and without informing R &amp; B, falsified his data logs due to his bleak financial situation, because if he had followed the driving regulation, Mailloux would have earned less money. Petitioners claim that R &amp; B later uncovered these violations and informed Mailloux of them in order to compel him to conform to R &amp; B's policy of requiring its drivers to comply with the driving regulation. Thus, Petitioners claim that, rather than as a result of his protected activity, Mailloux was terminated for a legitimate business purpose: because he refused to conform his conduct to the company's standards of properly logging driving time and keeping within the requirements of the driving regulation.</p>\n<p>However, the ALJ specifically disbelieved Beaudry's testimony. First, the ALJ found that Beaudry's testimony that R &amp; B required its drivers to comply with the driving regulation was undermined by the DOT reports. Second, the ALJ concluded that Beaudry was \"lying\" when he told Kidder that he had never received any previous citations from the DOT for hours of service violations.<sup>[12]</sup> As the finder of fact and a witness to Beaudry's testimony, the ALJ's \"credibility determinations are entitled to great deference.\" <i>See </i><i>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197419\"><a href=\"/opinion/197419/gioioso-v-oshrc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 108 (1st Cir.1997). We have previously observed in another case involving alleged retaliation when an employee engaged in protected activity that a fact finder can find pretext for unlawful termination where \"the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\" <i>See </i><i>McDonough v. City of Quincy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202275\"><a href=\"/opinion/202275/mcdonough-v-city-of-quincy/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 143, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span> (2000))(internal quotation marks omitted). The ALJ could thus find that Beaudry's testimony about Mailloux's on-the-job conduct was pretext for Mailloux's unlawful termination because the ALJ had found Beaudry's proferred explanation to be unworthy of credence.</p>\n<p>Other evidence in the record further supports the ALJ's finding that Mailloux's termination was on account of his protected activity and not his non-compliance with the driving regulation. Bagley testified that Petitioners were aware that their drivers exceeded the hours allotted by the driving regulation, and, further, that they expected their drivers to do so. Hill testified that Petitioners regularly pressured their drivers to violate the driving regulation. Thus, based on the testimonies of Mailloux, Beaudry, Bagley, and Hill, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> the DOT reports, we find that substantial evidence supports the findings that a causal connection existed between Mailloux's protected activity and the adverse employment action against him, and that Petitioners' proffered reason for terminating Mailloux was actually a pretext for unlawful retaliation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. The Back Pay Award</h2>\n<p>The ALJ noted in its recommended decision and order that Petitioners \"have not challenged August 25, 2004 as [Mailloux's] initial start date.\" Moreover, the ALJ found that Mailloux began work on August 25, 2004, based in part on an absence of any objection from Petitioners.</p>\n<p>The ARB found that, as the ALJ noted, R &amp; B did not raise before the ALJ any issue regarding or dispute concerning the calculation of Mailloux's back pay award. Consequently, based on its precedent declining \"to consider issues or arguments raised for the first time on appeal,\" the ARB declined to consider the matter, finding <i>both</i> that R &amp; B had waived this argument on appeal and that substantial evidence supported the ALJ's recommended back pay award. As a result, the ARB affirmed the ALJ's recommended back pay award.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue on appeal that the ALJ erred in determining that the start date of Mailloux's employment was August 25, 2004. Petitioners contend that their post-hearing brief, which the ALJ ordered on July 28, 2006, and which Petitioners filed on October 30, 2006, specifically addressed the issue of damages, and established Mailloux's start date as August 7, 2004.</p>\n<p>Petitioners did explicitly raise this matter in its post-hearing brief. Under the \"Statement of All Issues\" in that brief, Petitioners claimed that Mailloux's employment with R &amp; B spanned 133 days, which Petitioners reiterated in the \"Statement of Facts\" section of that brief and noted was based on an initial start date of August 7, 2004. However, despite the ALJ's instructions in its briefing order and warning about waiver,<sup>[13]</sup> this statement was unaccompanied by any argumentation in this brief and is also not addressed in any way in Petitioners' December 8, 2006, response to the post-hearing reply brief. Only on appeal do Petitioners proffer an argument for their proposed alternate start date: Mailloux signed a receipt for his copy of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations Pocket Book on that date, indicating he commenced employment then. As Petitioners, despite the ALJ's instructions and warning, did not specifically address in their post-hearing brief arguments concerning the back pay award, the ARB's legal ruling that they waived the matter was not \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we deny review.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The STAA prohibits employers from taking adverse employment actions against employees, including drivers of commercial motor vehicles, who engage in certain protected activities. 49 U.S.C. § 31105(j). Specifically, the STAA provides, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>\n<p>(1) A person may not discharge an employee, or discipline or discriminate against an employee regarding pay, terms, or privileges of employment, because</p>\n<p>(A)(i) the employee, or another person at the employee's request, has filed a complaint or begun a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety or security regulation, standard, or order, or has testified or will testify in such a proceeding ...</p>\n<p>(B) the employee refuses to operate a vehicle because</p>\n<p>(i) the operation violates a regulation, standard, or order of the United States related to commercial motor vehicle safety, health, or security....</p>\n<p>49 U.S.C. § 31105(a)(1)(A)(i)-(B)(i).</p>\n<p>[2]  These facts are drawn from the factual findings of the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), which the ARB affirmed.</p>\n<p>[3]  Mailloux's exact start date is disputed and germane to the back pay issue, which Petitioners raise in this petition. <i>See infra</i> Part III.D.</p>\n<p>[4]  The ALJ found that Mailloux was fired on December 17, 2004, a finding the ARB affirmed and is uncontested on appeal. Notwithstanding the ALJ's finding that Mailloux was \"discharged\" on December 21, 2004, and OSHA's order to Petitioners to pay Mailloux back wages from December 26, 2004, we thus adopt December 17, 2004, as Mailloux's undisputed termination date.</p>\n<p>[5]  49 C.F.R. § 395.3(b)(2) provides, in full:\n</p>\n<p>(b) No motor carrier shall permit or require a driver of a property-carrying commercial motor vehicle to drive, nor shall any driver drive a property-carrying commercial motor vehicle, regardless of the number of motor carriers using the driver's services, for any period after ...</p>\n<p>(2) Having been on duty 70 hours in any period of 8 consecutive days if the employing motor carrier operates commercial motor vehicles every day of the week.</p>\n<p>[6]  The recommended decision and order of the ALJ indicates that Mailloux initially called the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") investigator on \"December 20, 2005,\" and that the investigator conducted the interview with Mailloux on \"December 27, 2005.\" However, it is clear from the record that these events occurred on their respective dates in 2004.</p>\n<p>[7]  The record does not indicate what sort of \"agent\" conducted this investigation.</p>\n<p>[8]  The fact that these three companies share office space and drivers is, according to testimony the Division Administrator of the DOT's FMCSA provided to the ALJ, the reason their compliance with the driving regulation was jointly reviewed.</p>\n<p>[9]  49 U.S.C. § 31105(b)(3)(A), concerning \"Filing complaints and procedures,\" provides, in full:\n</p>\n<p>(3)(A) If the Secretary of Labor decides, on the basis of a complaint, a person violated subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Labor shall order the person to</p>\n<p>(i) take affirmative action to abate the violation;</p>\n<p>(ii) reinstate the complainant to the former position with the same pay and terms and privileges of employment; and</p>\n<p>(iii) pay compensatory damages, including backpay with interest and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p>[10]  The ALJ calculated this wage rate loss using the following figures. Mailloux worked for a total of 108 days between his start date on August 25, 2004, and his end date on December 17, 2004. During that time, he earned $14,919.66, which, when divided by 108, yielded a daily wage rate of $138.15. Given that Mailloux was out of work for 72 days between his end date with R &amp; B and the start date of his new employment on February 27, 2005, his daily wage of $138.15 multiplied by 72 days out of work yielded the $9,946.80 wage rate loss.</p>\n<p>[11]  Petitioners argue that their payment of the DOT penalties should not be taken as an admission of the underlying violations because, Petitioners claim, they paid the penalties merely \"in an effort to avoid litigation and to resolve the outstanding disputes.\" This argument is unavailing because Petitioners' reason for paying the penalties is irrelevant to their constructive admission.</p>\n<p>[12]  Although Kidder clarified on cross examination that Beaudry had actually said that he never violated the regulationsnot that he received no citationsthe ALJ's logic and conclusion here are still valid: because Beaudry's payment of the fines constituted an admission of the underlying violations, the testimony by Kidder on which the ALJ based the finding that Beaudry was lying did in fact support this finding.</p>\n<p>[13]  In its July 28, 2006 briefing order, the ALJ stated that each brief shall include an argument \"addressing each issue in a separately numbered section.\" Furthermore, the ALJ noted that \"issues or arguments not specifically addressed in the brief will be deemed to have been waived.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
