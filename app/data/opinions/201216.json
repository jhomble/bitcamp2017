Treace Dondocambey, a native and\n\ncitizen of Indonesia, entered the United States on November 17,\n\n2000, as a visitor for pleasure.        She remained here longer than her\n\nauthorized stay, and the INS issued a Notice to Appear on August\n\n28, 2001,     charging   the   petitioner    with   being   removable.      On\n\nNovember 7, 2001, the petitioner, with the assistance of counsel,\n\nconceded removability, renewed her application for political asylum\n\nand withholding of removal, and requested protection under Article\n\n3 of the Convention Against Torture.                On May 21, 2002, the\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) denied her claims, finding that she had not\n\nshown past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\non account of her religion, the basis for her claim of asylum, and\n\nthat she had offered no evidence of torture to establish a claim\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture.          See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)\n\n(discussing    eligibility     for   withholding    of   removal   under   the\n\nConvention Against Torture).          The Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) affirmed the decision without opinion, and Dondocambey now\n\npetitions for review of the order.          We affirm the BIA decision.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            We recount the facts largely as accepted by the IJ.\n\nDondocambey is a Christian.          In May of 1998, violent riots broke\n\nout in Indonesia often directed against the ethnic Chinese. In the\n\nmidst of this turmoil, the petitioner was attacked by a group of\n\nindividuals on May 14, 1998.         On the day of the attack, the riots\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fand looting continued on the streets in front of her office in\n\nJakarta, and she became increasingly fearful for her safety.             She\n\nsought and   received    permission   to   leave   work   early,   and   she\n\ncontacted two of her friends.         The three women attempted to go\n\nhome.   Along the way, a group of people carrying sharp objects\n\napproached and stopped them.     The group forced the women from the\n\ncar, tried to steal their wallets, jewelry, and cell phones; they\n\nthen attempted to rape each of the three women.\n\n          Dondocambey was dragged into the bushes by two attackers.\n\nShe pleaded with her attackers not to rape her.       She told them that\n\nshe was pregnant.       In response to a direct question about her\n\nreligion, she lied and said that she was Muslim.          She spoke a few\n\nwords in Arabic to convince them.       The leader of the group ordered\n\nthe others to let her go.     In testimony she said that if she had\n\nrevealed her true religion, she believes the attackers would have\n\nraped and perhaps killed her.     After the attackers released her,\n\nshe drove home accompanied by one of the other two women, who had\n\nbeen badly beaten, but was not raped after she said she was\n\nmenstruating.   The third woman did not leave with the petitioner.\n\nDondocambey testified that she tried to contact her after the\n\nincident and that she later heard the woman moved to Australia.\n\n          The petitioner returned to work approximately 7-10 days\n\nafter the attack.   She remained in Indonesia for more than two and\n\none-half years, until she entered the United States in November of\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f2000.    During this time, the petitioner did not experience another\n\nact of violence.    She stated that she continued to feel scared and\n\nthat she changed her behavior to avoid large crowds.                   Her family,\n\nincluding    her   husband,   still      live    in     Indonesia.         They   are\n\nChristians, and since the time of the petitioner's journey to the\n\nUnited States, they have lived unharmed in Indonesia. However, the\n\npetitioner    stated,   without    elaboration,          that    her   family     had\n\nproblems when they wanted to go to church.\n\n                                       II.\n\n             We summarize the findings of the IJ, which were affirmed\n\nwithout opinion by the BIA.1           The IJ found that the petitioner's\n\ntestimony regarding the attack was credible and determined that\n\n\"the rioters certainly did not pursue these three young women on\n\naccount of their being Christian.\"            As the IJ explained, \"there is\n\nno way that the rioters could have known whether or not the women\n\nwere Christian or Muslims, and in point of fact at least one of the\n\nother women was not a Christian.\" The IJ also found that the\n\nattempted rapes were not based on the women being Christian, for\n\nsimilar reasons.\n\n             The IJ also considered the 2001 United States Department\n\nof   State    Country   Report    on    the     topic    of     violence    against\n\n\n\n     1\n       When the BIA affirms the IJ's decision without opinion, the\nCourt of Appeals reviews the findings and conclusions of the IJ as\nthe final agency determination. Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365,\n373 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                       -4-\n\fChristians.     The IJ recognized that the Indonesian government is\n\nineffective against some forms of violence. That violence involved\n\n\"attacks    [by]   and    against      all   of    the      particular    religious\n\nfactions.\"     The IJ noted that \"[t]here [have] been attacks on\n\nchurches, mosque [sic], temples, and other religious facilities\n\nduring the year, and the government views proselyting by recognized\n\nreligions in areas heavily dominated by another recognized religion\n\nas potentially dangerous and disruptive and discourages it.\"                      The\n\nIJ also considered that the Indonesian constitution provides for\n\nreligious freedom of recognized religions, and this freedom is\n\ngenerally    respected     by    the   government.           The   law   officially\n\nrecognizes     five      religions,      including          Islam,     Catholicism,\n\nProtestantism, Buddhism, and Hinduism, and the government lifted\n\nits ban on Jehovah's Witnesses in June 2001.                 The IJ found that it\n\nwas clear \"that while there appears to be overt discrimination\n\nbetween the respective religious groups, there is no showing that\n\nthe discrimination is so pervasive and intolerable and either\n\ngovernment     directed     or    condoned        as   to     be     tantamount    to\n\npersecution.\"\n\n             The IJ also determined that before the attack in May of\n\n1998, the petitioner had experienced no difficulty on account of\n\nher religious beliefs:       she had completed high school, attended an\n\naccounting academy, and held a \"responsible position\" with a large\n\ncompany in Jakarta. Further, she returned to work after the attack\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\funtil she made plans to come to the United States in October of\n\n2000.       During that two and one-half years, she \"experienced no\n\ndifficulties\"; \"her family remains in Jakarta and is unharmed and\n\napparently doing well.\"\n\n              On the asylum claim, the IJ concluded that while the\n\nattack on the petitioner was \"regrettable and reprehensible,\" the\n\nattack did not take place on account of her religion.     The IJ found\n\nthe attacks to be \"acts of criminality, perhaps targeting those of\n\nChinese ethnicity, but clearly not directed against those of the\n\nChristian faith.\"2\n\n              As to the Convention Against Torture claim,3 the IJ also\n\n\n     2\n       The petitioner argues in her brief that the attack could\nhave been based on Chinese ethnicity. The petitioner cannot raise\nthis claim for the first time in her petition for review. Ravindran\nv. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 761 (1st Cir. 1992)(the petitioner is\nrequired to exhaust administrative remedies prior to seeking\njudicial remedies, and \"[i]ssues not raised before the Board may\nnot be raised for the first time upon judicial review of the\nBoard's decision\"). There is no evidence in the record that the\npetitioner clearly raised the ethnic Chinese claim before the IJ or\nthe BIA.   To the contrary, in her affidavit in support of her\nasylum application, she states that she is an \"Indonesian of ethnic\nManadonese and Christian religion.\" She does assert in her brief\nthat her physical appearance is similar to that of an ethnic\nChinese. However, in response to the question on her application\nfor asylum concerning the basis for which she has \"ever been\nmistreated or threatened,\" she checked only the box for religion.\n     Furthermore, as we read the record, there is nothing to compel\nthe conclusion that discrimination against individuals of Chinese\nethnicity caused her to be subject to past persecution or to have\na well-founded fear of future persecution.\n        3\n       The petitioner has waived her claim under the Convention\nAgainst Torture because she did not raise it in her petition for\nreview. See Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 28 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002).\nIn any event, we would uphold the IJ's denial of relief under the\n\n                                   -6-\n\fconcluded     that   the     petitioner        offered    no    evidence    that   the\n\nIndonesian government or its officials torture persons on account\n\nof their religion.\n\n                                         III.\n\n             We    review    the    IJ's    findings      under    the    deferential\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.                 INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992).      Determinations of eligibility for asylum must be\n\nupheld if \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record, considered as a whole.\"                       Id. (internal\n\nquotation omitted). \"To reverse the [Immigration Judge's] findings\n\nwe   must    conclude     that     the   evidence     not      only   supports     that\n\nconclusion, but compels it.\"             Id. at 481 n.1.\n\n              The burden of proof for establishing eligibility for\n\nasylum      lies   with     the    petitioner.        8   C.F.R.      §   1208.13(a).\n\nApplicants must show either past persecution or a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution based on one of the five statutory grounds of\n\n\"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\" Id. § 1208.13(b)(1).\n\n              To prove past persecution, the petitioner must provide\n\npersuasive evidence that she was persecuted on any of the five\n\nstatutory grounds.        Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 316 F.3d 31, 34-35 (1st\n\nCir.     2002).      To     establish      a     well-founded     fear     of   future\n\n\n\nConvention Against Torture because                  the   IJ's    determination     is\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n                                           -7-\n\fpersecution, \"applicants can offer specific proof, or they can\n\nclaim the benefit of a regulatory presumption based on proof of\n\npast persecution.\"   Khalil v. Ashcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   To demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution,\n\n\"a petitioner must satisfy both an objective and a subjective\n\ntest.\"   Id.   The individual's fear \"must be both genuine and\n\nobjectively reasonable.\"   Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          \"[W]ithholding [of removal] is mandatory if an alien\n\n'establish[es] that it is more likely than not that [he] would be\n\nsubject to persecution on one of the specified grounds.'\"   INS v.\n\nAguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 419 (1999) (quoting INS v. Stevic,\n\n467 U.S. 407, 429-30 (1984)). \"Because the 'more likely than not'\n\nstandard for withholding [removal] is more stringent than that for\n\nasylum, a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard\" will\n\nalso not satisfy the withholding standard. Albathani, 318 F.3d at\n\n372.\n\n           Substantial evidence supports the IJ's finding that the\n\nattack on petitioner was not on account of her Christian faith.\n\nAdditionally, the petitioner lived in Indonesia for over two years\n\nafter the attack. Although she expressed some fear of large crowds\n\nand testified that she changed her behavior to avoid them, she did\n\nnot experience any violence or threats because of her Christian\n\nfaith, nor has her family since her departure.\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f           Because petitioner has not satisfied the more lenient\n\nasylum standard, she has also failed to satisfy the withholding of\n\nremoval standard.   Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.\n\n                                IV.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

That violence involved\n\n\"attacks    [by]   and    against      all   of    the      particular    religious\n\nfactions.\"     The IJ noted that \"[t]here [have] been attacks on\n\nchurches, mosque [sic], temples, and other religious facilities\n\nduring the year, and the government views proselyting by recognized\n\nreligions in areas heavily dominated by another recognized religion\n\nas potentially dangerous and disruptive and discourages it.\"                      The\n\nIJ also considered that the Indonesian constitution provides for\n\nreligious freedom of recognized religions, and this freedom is\n\ngenerally    respected     by    the   government.           The   law   officially\n\nrecognizes     five      religions,      including          Islam,     Catholicism,\n\nProtestantism, Buddhism, and Hinduism, and the government lifted\n\nits ban on Jehovah's Witnesses in June 2001.                 The IJ found that it\n\nwas clear \"that while there appears to be overt discrimination\n\nbetween the respective religious groups, there is no showing that\n\nthe discrimination is so pervasive and intolerable and either\n\ngovernment     directed     or    condoned        as   to     be     tantamount    to\n\npersecution.\"\n\n             The IJ also determined that before the attack in May of\n\n1998, the petitioner had experienced no difficulty on account of\n\nher religious beliefs:       she had completed high school, attended an\n\naccounting academy, and held a \"responsible position\" with a large\n\ncompany in Jakarta. Further, she returned to work after the attack\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\funtil she made plans to come to the United States in October of\n\n2000.       During that two and one-half years, she \"experienced no\n\ndifficulties\"; \"her family remains in Jakarta and is unharmed and\n\napparently doing well.\"\n\n              On the asylum claim, the IJ concluded that while the\n\nattack on the petitioner was \"regrettable and reprehensible,\" the\n\nattack did not take place on account of her religion.     The IJ found\n\nthe attacks to be \"acts of criminality, perhaps targeting those of\n\nChinese ethnicity, but clearly not directed against those of the\n\nChristian faith.\"2\n\n              As to the Convention Against Torture claim,3 the IJ also\n\n\n     2\n       The petitioner argues in her brief that the attack could\nhave been based on Chinese ethnicity.

There is no evidence in the record that the\npetitioner clearly raised the ethnic Chinese claim before the IJ or\nthe BIA.   To the contrary, in her affidavit in support of her\nasylum application, she states that she is an \"Indonesian of ethnic\nManadonese and Christian religion.\" She does assert in her brief\nthat her physical appearance is similar to that of an ethnic\nChinese. However, in response to the question on her application\nfor asylum concerning the basis for which she has \"ever been\nmistreated or threatened,\" she checked only the box for religion.\n     Furthermore, as we read the record, there is nothing to compel\nthe conclusion that discrimination against individuals of Chinese\nethnicity caused her to be subject to past persecution or to have\na well-founded fear of future persecution.\n        3\n       The petitioner has waived her claim under the Convention\nAgainst Torture because she did not raise it in her petition for\nreview.
