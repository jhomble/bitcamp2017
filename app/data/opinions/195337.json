Second, inasmuch as the sentence\n                         \n\nimposed upon  appellant was within the  statutory limits, the\n\nfact that it  was imposed by  a different judge from  the one\n\nwho  sentenced  appellant's  coconspirator  \"is  an  adequate\n\nexplanation for  the disparity [in  sentences] and eliminates\n\nany possible appearance of vindictiveness.\"  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nQuejada-Zurique, 708 F.2d 857,  861 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n464 U.S. 855 (1983).  \n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -2-\n",
