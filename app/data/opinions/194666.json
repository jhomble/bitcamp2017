Appellant  Optica  Lee  Borinquen  (\"Optica\")\n          Per Curiam.\n                    \n\nchallenges, as moot,  a National Labor Relations Board  (\"NLRB\") peti-\n\ntion for enforcement of a \"cease and desist\" order entered November 5,\n\n1991.  We grant enforcement and assess double costs against Optica.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Optica  owns 32  optical stores  in Puerto  Rico.   In 1989,\n\nafter  a change in management, Optica proposed certain changes in work\n\nrules for optometrists at  its stores.  The optometrists  responded by\n\norganizing  a union,  Federacion  de Optometras  de Puerto  Rico (\"the\n\nUnion\").    Optica's management  campaigned  aggressively against  the\n\nUnion, and several employees were terminated or  transferred in appar-\n\nent reprisal  for their organizing activities.  Despite these tactics,\n\nthe  Union won its representation election and was certified on Novem-\n\nber 3, 1989.  Ignoring the election results, and refusing to negotiate\n\nwith the Union, Optica went  ahead with its new work rules.  The Union\n\nfiled an unfair labor practice complaint.\n\n          On November  5, 1991, an  administrative law judge  issued a\n\n\"cease and desist\" order  requiring Optica, inter alia, (1)  to termi-\n                                                      \n\nnate its harassment of pro-Union employees;  (2) to reinstate the work\n\nrules that  existed  before the  Union  was designated  as  bargaining\n\nrepresentative;   (3) to notify the Union,  and bargain in good faith,\n\nbefore making changes in these work rules;   (4) to post the order  in\n\nall  stores;  and (5) to offer certain discharged employees reinstate-\n\nment  and back  pay.  An  NLRB appeals  panel adopted  the order, with\n\nminor changes, on May 26, 1992.\n\n          On  October 5, 1992, the NLRB filed the instant petition for\n\nenforcement of the order.  Optica resists.  It does  not challenge the\n\nALJ's  findings, or the statutory  or equitable bases  for the Board's\n\nenforcement  petition, but asserts that it has complied with the order\n\nto  the extent possible, and that any remaining areas of noncompliance\n\nstem from  the Union's own  failure to  cooperate.  By  virtue of  its\n\n\"substantial compliance\" with the terms of the order, Optica suggests,\n\nthe NLRB enforcement proceeding is moot.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Optica's  petition  is  frivolous.   As  the  Supreme  Court\n\nrepeatedly has  ruled, see NLRB  v. Raytheon  Co., 398 U.S.  25, 26-27\n                                                 \n\n(1970); NLRB v.

The First Circuit  has endorsed this\n\nrule in several  published opinions.  See,  e.g., NLRB v.

As numerous courts  have recognized, an  employer's compliance\n\nmay be temporary, and  noncompliance may resume if enforcement  is not\n\nordered by the court of appeals.   See P*I*E, 894 F.2d at 890  (citing\n                                            \n\nOlin  Industries, Inc. v.  NLRB, 72 F.Supp. 225,  229 (D.

On  this  history the  Board  may  reasonably\n          desire the finality of  judicial resolution of its\n          own decisions as well as a court order to serve as\n          a  pointed  deterrent  against resumption  of  the\n          illegal practices.\n\nPearl Bookbinding, 517 F.2d at 1114.\n                 \n\n          We  grant enforcement of the  NLRB order.
