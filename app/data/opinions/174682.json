Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                     Lipez, Howard and Thompson,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Donna M. Nesselbush and Marasco and Nesselbush, LLP on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Dulce Donovan, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Peter F. Neronha,\nUnited States Attorney and Robert J. Triba, Regional Chief Counsel,\nSocial Security Administration, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            September 2, 2010\n\f           Per Curiam.    Claimant Richard Frusher filed applications\n\nfor Social Security disability benefits in 1975 and 1978, both of\n\nthese applications were denied at the initial stage, and claimant\n\nmissed the deadlines for appealing either denial.             Claimant then\n\nfiled a successful application in November 2003, and he was found\n\nto have been disabled, on the basis of a psychotic disorder, as of\n\nApril 1, 1975. Claimant subsequently died, and his widow, Cecilia,\n\nwas substituted as the party in interest.\n\n           Ms. Frusher then requested that the time limits for\n\nappealing the initial denials of the 1975 and 1978 applications be\n\nextended on the ground of good cause -- i.e., claimant’s mental\n\nimpairment had prevented him from being able to file, or to\n\nunderstand the need to file, timely requests for review.              See 20\n\nC.F.R. § 404.909(b) and § 404.911(a)(4).           After a hearing, a\n\ndifferent administrative law judge (ALJ) denied an extension of\n\ntime, concluding that claimant had not made the requisite showing.\n\nBecause this conclusion is marred by unsupported factual findings,\n\nwe must vacate the district court’s grant of judgment in favor of\n\nthe Commissioner and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                     I.   The Disability Decision\n\n           We assume familiarity with the statutory and regulatory\n\nframework, as well as with the standard of review, and we therefore\n\nbegin with a description of the first ALJ’s decision finding that\n\nclaimant   was   disabled.    The   ALJ’s   conclusion   in    this   regard\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fessentially was based on the testimony of an impartial medical\n\nexpert,     psychiatrist     Dr.   John       Ruggiano.      However,      as     the\n\nCommissioner has lost the hearing tape, we must rely on the ALJ’s\n\nrecounting of such testimony.         We also note that the ALJ described\n\nDr. Ruggiano’s opinions as “consistent with and supported by the\n\nrecord as a whole,” Trans. at 38, and, since they are the only\n\nspecific    evidence      mentioned   in      the    discussion   of    claimant’s\n\nimpairments, we assume that the ALJ, at least implicitly, was\n\nadopting these opinions as the factual underpinnings for his\n\ndisability determination.\n\n            First,   Dr.    Ruggiano      addressed     claimant’s      functional\n\nlimitations and testified that claimant had marked restrictions in\n\nhis abilities (1) to engage in the activities of daily living, (2)\n\nto function socially, and (3) to maintain concentration and persist\n\nat tasks.    Id.    Dr. Ruggiano also described claimant as suffering\n\nfrom   a     psychotic      disorder,      accompanied      by     delusions      or\n\nhallucinations,      grossly    disorganized         behavior,    and     emotional\n\nisolation and withdrawal. Id. Given this, Dr. Ruggiano explained,\n\nclaimant    could    be    considered     to    be    disabled    under    §    12.03\n\n(Schizophrenic, Paranoid and Other Psychotic Disorders) of the\n\nListings of Impairments, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.\n\n            Claimant appealed, and the Appeals Council first affirmed\n\nthe ALJ’s decision concerning claimant’s disability and the April\n\n1, 1975 date on which he had become disabled.               Trans. at 41.        The\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fCouncil then ordered a remand for a new hearing, id., and such\n\nhearing was held before a different ALJ.\n\n         II.     The Decision Denying an Extension of Time\n\n          The new ALJ, as noted, rejected claimant’s arguments\n\nregarding the existence of good cause for an extension of time to\n\nappeal from either the September 4, 1975 denial of his first\n\ndisability benefits application or the July 11, 1978 denial of the\n\nsecond such application. In support of this ruling, the second ALJ\n\ncited the following:      (1) claimant never had been adjudicated\n\nmentally incompetent; (2) claimant, during September 1975 and July\n\n1978, had been left alone at home, without a caretaker; (3)\n\nclaimant, during this same time, had not been hospitalized and\n\nthere was nothing in the record evidence indicating that there had\n\nbeen an exacerbation in his condition; (4) claimant had experienced\n\nno problems in filing the two prior applications; (5) claimant had\n\nworked, although not at the substantial gainful activity level,\n\nduring the time that he claimed to have been disabled; (6) claimant\n\nhad been allowed to be in charge of the mail and paying the bills;\n\nand (7) claimant had not transferred power of attorney to his wife\n\nuntil 1996, at which time he would have had to have been competent.\n\nId. at 21, 23.   The ALJ did not mention the first ALJ’s adoption of\n\nDr.   Ruggiano’s     opinions   regarding   claimant’s   functional\n\nlimitations.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f              The Appeals Council denied claimant’s request for review,\n\nand     the   district    court   granted      judgment   in    favor      of   the\n\nCommissioner.      This appeal ensued.\n\n                              III.      Discussion\n\n              For the following reasons, we find that the factors cited\n\nby the second ALJ do not provide substantial support for the\n\nconclusion     that   claimant    had    failed   to   show   that   his    mental\n\ndisorder had prevented him from timely appealing the denials of the\n\nprior applications.        First, it appears from the initial decision\n\nawarding disability benefits that claimant had not engaged in any\n\nkind of work activity during the relevant time periods -- 1975 and\n\n1978.     That is, and as the first ALJ specifically pointed out,\n\nalthough claimant’s work record showed covered earnings in 1975 and\n\n1976, such reflected accrued sick and vacation pay, “not work\n\nactivity after December 31, 1974.”            Trans. at 37 (emphasis added).\n\nAnd, as for 1978, the record shows that claimant had no earnings\n\nduring that year.        Id. at 172.\n\n              Second, the ALJ’s finding that claimant had been “in\n\ncharge” of the mail is not entirely accurate.             That is, claimant’s\n\nwidow testified at the second hearing that claimant’s control over\n\nthe mail essentially existed because she usually had been at work\n\nat the time that the mail had been delivered.                 Id. at 269, 271.\n\nAnd, while Ms. Frusher stated that she had permitted claimant to be\n\nin control of paying the bills, such had occurred in the early\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f1990s -- not the 1970s -- and, as the ALJ himself acknowledged, she\n\ncalled this decision a “major mistake.”             Id. at 271-72.          Similarly\n\nirrelevant     is   the    fact    that    claimant     had    been    sufficiently\n\ncompetent to transfer power of attorney to his wife in 1996; that\n\nis, claimant’s state of mind in 1975 and 1978 is the issue.\n\n           Next, the ALJ’s finding that claimant had experienced no\n\ndifficulties in filing the two prior applications arguably is\n\naccurate only in relation to the 1978 application.                   As for the 1975\n\napplication, Ms. Frusher specifically testified that, although she\n\ncould not remember exactly how claimant had filed it, she “kn[e]w\n\nhe didn’t do it alone.”           Id. at 270.     That is, she explained, she\n\nwas unsure whether “it was me or the company [claimant’s former\n\nemployer] that helped him apply for it.”                Id.    This testimony, we\n\nthink, clearly indicates that someone had assisted claimant in\n\nsubmitting the 1975 application.            The ALJ nonetheless, and without\n\nexplanation, viewed Ms. Frusher (1) as admitting that she had not\n\nhelped   claimant    and    (2)     as    speculating      only     that   claimant’s\n\nemployer “may” have helped him.             Id. at 21 n.4, 23 n.8.          Since Ms.\n\nFrusher never so testified, and since there is no other evidence on\n\nthe   issue,   the   conclusion          that   claimant      had   experienced   no\n\ndifficulties in filing the 1975 application simply has no support\n\nin the record.\n\n           We also think that the fact that claimant had been left\n\nalone at home without someone watching over him says little about\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fhis mental capacity for understanding and following instructions\n\nconcerning      how    to    appeal   the     denial      of   a   social    security\n\napplication.       Rather, it seems likely that this factor is more\n\npertinent to such issues as whether claimant, without supervision,\n\ncould take care of his physical and other such needs or whether, if\n\nleft alone, he might, say, burn the house down.                    In any event, the\n\nCommissioner does not explain this factor’s pertinence to the issue\n\nat hand.\n\n             This leaves, in addition to the inference that claimant\n\nhad filed the 1978 application on his own, the other two factors\n\ncited   by   the      second   ALJ:     (1)    that       claimant    had    not    been\n\nadjudicated     incompetent;      and   (2)     that      claimant    had    not    been\n\nhospitalized in September 1975 or July 1978 and there was no\n\nindication in the record that his condition had been exacerbated\n\nduring this time.           The primary problem with the first factor is\n\nthat    there    is    no    requirement      that    a    claimant    be    declared\n\nincompetent, and the fact that claimant was not so declared simply\n\ncannot support an inference that he therefore was sufficiently\n\ncompetent to be able to follow the administrative appeals process.\n\n             As for the second factor, the Commissioner points out\n\nthat,   although       claimant   had   been     hospitalized         in    1975,    his\n\ndischarge had occurred about six months prior to the September 4,\n\n1975 denial notice.         Similarly, the Commissioner notes that, while\n\nclaimant had been hospitalized twice in 1978, his release had\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\foccurred    about    one    month   before       the    July    11,    1978    denial.\n\nMoreover,   the     Commissioner     continues,        the     records      from   these\n\nhospitalizations        indicate    that,       when    not     in    the    hospital,\n\nclaimant’s symptoms had not been exacerbated.\n\n            The difficulty with the Commissioner’s position is that\n\nhe, as well as the second ALJ, ignore the impact of the first ALJ’s\n\nfactual findings -- i.e., that, as of April 1, 1975, claimant (1)\n\nhad experienced marked limitations in performing the activities of\n\ndaily living, in maintaining concentration, and in persisting at\n\ntasks, and (2) had exhibited grossly disorganized behavior.                        These\n\nfindings are not limited to how claimant would function in a work\n\nsetting, and, as explained below, they implicate his ability to do\n\nthings for himself -- the touchstone, in this case, of the good\n\ncause   analysis.          See   Social    Security         Ruling    91-5p,       Mental\n\nIncapacity and Good Cause for Missing the Deadline to Request\n\nReview, 1991 WL 208067, at *2.\n\n            In   this    regard,    activities         of   daily     living   include\n\n“adaptive activities such as cleaning, shopping, cooking, taking\n\npublic transportation, paying bills, maintaining a residence, . .\n\n. using telephones and directories, and using a post office.”                         20\n\nC.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, § 12.00(C)(1).                      And, “marked”\n\nrestrictions in these kinds of activities will be found where “the\n\ndegree of limitation is such as to interfere seriously with [a\n\nclaimant’s]      ability    to   function       independently,        appropriately,\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\feffectively,      and     on     a    sustained     basis.”          Id.      §    12.00(C).\n\nSimilarly,     while      someone       with    a   “marked”       limitation         in    the\n\nabilities to concentrate and persist at tasks might be able to\n\ncomplete simple tasks, he or she often cannot do so without\n\nsupervision or assistance.              Id. § 12.00(C)(3).\n\n           Given this, we think that the findings make by the first\n\nALJ establish that claimant’s mental condition seriously impaired\n\nhis   abilities     (1)    to        independently       take    care    of       basic    life\n\nactivities,     (2)       to     complete       tasks      without       assistance          or\n\nsupervision, and (3) to act in any kind of organized fashion.\n\nMoreover, the first ALJ did not restrict claimant’s functional\n\nlimitations    to   any        specific    time     --    e.g.,    when    claimant         was\n\nhospitalized or about to be hospitalized.                       Nor, since the tape of\n\nthe first hearing has been lost, is there any evidence that Dr.\n\nRuggiano so restricted his opinions.                     As a result, and resolving\n\nall reasonable doubt in claimant’s favor as we must, see SSR 91-5p,\n\nwe assume that the first ALJ implicitly had found that claimant\n\ngenerally had experienced such limitations, including when he was\n\noutside of the hospital.\n\n           In light of this, the fact that claimant had not been in\n\nthe hospital in September 1975 or July 1978 cannot support the\n\ninference that his psychotic disorder thus did not prevent him from\n\nbeing   able   to   process          timely    appeals     at    those     times.          Also\n\ninadequate to support such inference is the Commissioner’s citation\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\fto   isolated     statements     in   the    25-page    treatment   record   of\n\nclaimant’s      in-patient     hospitalizations,       which   statements    say\n\nnothing specific about claimant’s state of mind during the relevant\n\ntimes.      Last, and assuming that claimant had filed the 1978\n\napplication on his own, we do not think that this fact, standing\n\nalone, constitutes substantial evidence to support the conclusion\n\nthat claimant possessed the ability to appeal from the denial of\n\nthat application.     Compare Matos v. Secretary of Health, Education\n\nand Welfare, 581 F.2d 282, 287 (1st Cir. 1978) (considering, where\n\nthere was very little in the way of evidence showing a mental\n\nimpairment in the first place, the fact that claimant had been able\n\nto file a prior application); Shrader v. Heckler, 754 F.2d 142, 144\n\n(4th Cir. 1985) (noting, in finding that the claimant’s mental\n\nimpairment had not prevented him from pursuing his administrative\n\nremedies, the facts (1) that claimant had written to his lawyer\n\nstating that he would appeal every denial of his disability claims\n\nand (2) that claimant had, in fact, appealed one of the prior\n\ndenials).\n\n            The sticking point is that, although the administrative\n\nrecord before this court contains only the reports from claimant’s\n\nin-patient hospitalizations (and they are the only medical data\n\nlisted in the record’s table of contents, Trans. at 6), the first\n\nALJ, in determining that claimant was disabled, stated that he also\n\nhad reviewed the treatment notes from the various psychiatrists who\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fhad seen claimant on an out-patient basis during the intervals\n\nbetween hospitalizations.   See id. at 37.   Given this, and given\n\nthe flawed findings in the second ALJ’s decision, we are of the\n\nview that such records, which might reveal information about\n\nclaimant’s functioning at the relevant times, should be reviewed.\n\nAs such, we conclude that a remand is required.\n\n           The judgment of the district court therefore is vacated,\n\nand the case is remanded to that court with instructions to remand\n\nto the Commissioner for further proceedings in accordance with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

The Disability Decision\n\n           We assume familiarity with the statutory and regulatory\n\nframework, as well as with the standard of review, and we therefore\n\nbegin with a description of the first ALJ’s decision finding that\n\nclaimant   was   disabled.    The   ALJ’s   conclusion   in    this   regard\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fessentially was based on the testimony of an impartial medical\n\nexpert,     psychiatrist     Dr.   John       Ruggiano.      However,      as     the\n\nCommissioner has lost the hearing tape, we must rely on the ALJ’s\n\nrecounting of such testimony.         We also note that the ALJ described\n\nDr. Ruggiano’s opinions as “consistent with and supported by the\n\nrecord as a whole,” Trans. at 38, and, since they are the only\n\nspecific    evidence      mentioned   in      the    discussion   of    claimant’s\n\nimpairments, we assume that the ALJ, at least implicitly, was\n\nadopting these opinions as the factual underpinnings for his\n\ndisability determination.\n\n            First,   Dr.    Ruggiano      addressed     claimant’s      functional\n\nlimitations and testified that claimant had marked restrictions in\n\nhis abilities (1) to engage in the activities of daily living, (2)\n\nto function socially, and (3) to maintain concentration and persist\n\nat tasks.    Id.    Dr. Ruggiano also described claimant as suffering\n\nfrom   a     psychotic      disorder,      accompanied      by     delusions      or\n\nhallucinations,      grossly    disorganized         behavior,    and     emotional\n\nisolation and withdrawal. Id. Given this, Dr. Ruggiano explained,\n\nclaimant    could    be    considered     to    be    disabled    under    §    12.03\n\n(Schizophrenic, Paranoid and Other Psychotic Disorders) of the\n\nListings of Impairments, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.\n\n            Claimant appealed, and the Appeals Council first affirmed\n\nthe ALJ’s decision concerning claimant’s disability and the April\n\n1, 1975 date on which he had become disabled.               Trans. at 41.        The\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fCouncil then ordered a remand for a new hearing, id., and such\n\nhearing was held before a different ALJ.\n\n         II.     The Decision Denying an Extension of Time\n\n          The new ALJ, as noted, rejected claimant’s arguments\n\nregarding the existence of good cause for an extension of time to\n\nappeal from either the September 4, 1975 denial of his first\n\ndisability benefits application or the July 11, 1978 denial of the\n\nsecond such application. In support of this ruling, the second ALJ\n\ncited the following:      (1) claimant never had been adjudicated\n\nmentally incompetent; (2) claimant, during September 1975 and July\n\n1978, had been left alone at home, without a caretaker; (3)\n\nclaimant, during this same time, had not been hospitalized and\n\nthere was nothing in the record evidence indicating that there had\n\nbeen an exacerbation in his condition; (4) claimant had experienced\n\nno problems in filing the two prior applications; (5) claimant had\n\nworked, although not at the substantial gainful activity level,\n\nduring the time that he claimed to have been disabled; (6) claimant\n\nhad been allowed to be in charge of the mail and paying the bills;\n\nand (7) claimant had not transferred power of attorney to his wife\n\nuntil 1996, at which time he would have had to have been competent.\n\nId. at 21, 23.   The ALJ did not mention the first ALJ’s adoption of\n\nDr.   Ruggiano’s     opinions   regarding   claimant’s   functional\n\nlimitations.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f              The Appeals Council denied claimant’s request for review,\n\nand     the   district    court   granted      judgment   in    favor      of   the\n\nCommissioner.      This appeal ensued.\n\n                              III.      Discussion\n\n              For the following reasons, we find that the factors cited\n\nby the second ALJ do not provide substantial support for the\n\nconclusion     that   claimant    had    failed   to   show   that   his    mental\n\ndisorder had prevented him from timely appealing the denials of the\n\nprior applications.        First, it appears from the initial decision\n\nawarding disability benefits that claimant had not engaged in any\n\nkind of work activity during the relevant time periods -- 1975 and\n\n1978.     That is, and as the first ALJ specifically pointed out,\n\nalthough claimant’s work record showed covered earnings in 1975 and\n\n1976, such reflected accrued sick and vacation pay, “not work\n\nactivity after December 31, 1974.”            Trans. at 37 (emphasis added).\n\nAnd, as for 1978, the record shows that claimant had no earnings\n\nduring that year.        Id. at 172.\n\n              Second, the ALJ’s finding that claimant had been “in\n\ncharge” of the mail is not entirely accurate.             That is, claimant’s\n\nwidow testified at the second hearing that claimant’s control over\n\nthe mail essentially existed because she usually had been at work\n\nat the time that the mail had been delivered.                 Id. at 269, 271.\n\nAnd, while Ms. Frusher stated that she had permitted claimant to be\n\nin control of paying the bills, such had occurred in the early\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f1990s -- not the 1970s -- and, as the ALJ himself acknowledged, she\n\ncalled this decision a “major mistake.”             Id. at 271-72.          Similarly\n\nirrelevant     is   the    fact    that    claimant     had    been    sufficiently\n\ncompetent to transfer power of attorney to his wife in 1996; that\n\nis, claimant’s state of mind in 1975 and 1978 is the issue.\n\n           Next, the ALJ’s finding that claimant had experienced no\n\ndifficulties in filing the two prior applications arguably is\n\naccurate only in relation to the 1978 application.                   As for the 1975\n\napplication, Ms. Frusher specifically testified that, although she\n\ncould not remember exactly how claimant had filed it, she “kn[e]w\n\nhe didn’t do it alone.”           Id. at 270.     That is, she explained, she\n\nwas unsure whether “it was me or the company [claimant’s former\n\nemployer] that helped him apply for it.”                Id.    This testimony, we\n\nthink, clearly indicates that someone had assisted claimant in\n\nsubmitting the 1975 application.            The ALJ nonetheless, and without\n\nexplanation, viewed Ms. Frusher (1) as admitting that she had not\n\nhelped   claimant    and    (2)     as    speculating      only     that   claimant’s\n\nemployer “may” have helped him.             Id. at 21 n.4, 23 n.8.          Since Ms.\n\nFrusher never so testified, and since there is no other evidence on\n\nthe   issue,   the   conclusion          that   claimant      had   experienced   no\n\ndifficulties in filing the 1975 application simply has no support\n\nin the record.\n\n           We also think that the fact that claimant had been left\n\nalone at home without someone watching over him says little about\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fhis mental capacity for understanding and following instructions\n\nconcerning      how    to    appeal   the     denial      of   a   social    security\n\napplication.       Rather, it seems likely that this factor is more\n\npertinent to such issues as whether claimant, without supervision,\n\ncould take care of his physical and other such needs or whether, if\n\nleft alone, he might, say, burn the house down.                    In any event, the\n\nCommissioner does not explain this factor’s pertinence to the issue\n\nat hand.\n\n             This leaves, in addition to the inference that claimant\n\nhad filed the 1978 application on his own, the other two factors\n\ncited   by   the      second   ALJ:     (1)    that       claimant    had    not    been\n\nadjudicated     incompetent;      and   (2)     that      claimant    had    not    been\n\nhospitalized in September 1975 or July 1978 and there was no\n\nindication in the record that his condition had been exacerbated\n\nduring this time.           The primary problem with the first factor is\n\nthat    there    is    no    requirement      that    a    claimant    be    declared\n\nincompetent, and the fact that claimant was not so declared simply\n\ncannot support an inference that he therefore was sufficiently\n\ncompetent to be able to follow the administrative appeals process.\n\n             As for the second factor, the Commissioner points out\n\nthat,   although       claimant   had   been     hospitalized         in    1975,    his\n\ndischarge had occurred about six months prior to the September 4,\n\n1975 denial notice.         Similarly, the Commissioner notes that, while\n\nclaimant had been hospitalized twice in 1978, his release had\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\foccurred    about    one    month   before       the    July    11,    1978    denial.\n\nMoreover,   the     Commissioner     continues,        the     records      from   these\n\nhospitalizations        indicate    that,       when    not     in    the    hospital,\n\nclaimant’s symptoms had not been exacerbated.\n\n            The difficulty with the Commissioner’s position is that\n\nhe, as well as the second ALJ, ignore the impact of the first ALJ’s\n\nfactual findings -- i.e., that, as of April 1, 1975, claimant (1)\n\nhad experienced marked limitations in performing the activities of\n\ndaily living, in maintaining concentration, and in persisting at\n\ntasks, and (2) had exhibited grossly disorganized behavior.                        These\n\nfindings are not limited to how claimant would function in a work\n\nsetting, and, as explained below, they implicate his ability to do\n\nthings for himself -- the touchstone, in this case, of the good\n\ncause   analysis.          See   Social    Security         Ruling    91-5p,       Mental\n\nIncapacity and Good Cause for Missing the Deadline to Request\n\nReview, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">208067</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2.\n\n            In   this    regard,    activities         of   daily     living   include\n\n“adaptive activities such as cleaning, shopping, cooking, taking\n\npublic transportation, paying bills, maintaining a residence, . .\n\n. using telephones and directories, and using a post office.”                         20\n\nC.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, § 12.00(C)(1).                      And, “marked”\n\nrestrictions in these kinds of activities will be found where “the\n\ndegree of limitation is such as to interfere seriously with [a\n\nclaimant’s]      ability    to   function       independently,        appropriately,\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\feffectively,      and     on     a    sustained     basis.”          Id.      §    12.00(C).\n\nSimilarly,     while      someone       with    a   “marked”       limitation         in    the\n\nabilities to concentrate and persist at tasks might be able to\n\ncomplete simple tasks, he or she often cannot do so without\n\nsupervision or assistance.              Id. § 12.00(C)(3).\n\n           Given this, we think that the findings make by the first\n\nALJ establish that claimant’s mental condition seriously impaired\n\nhis   abilities     (1)    to        independently       take    care    of       basic    life\n\nactivities,     (2)       to     complete       tasks      without       assistance          or\n\nsupervision, and (3) to act in any kind of organized fashion.\n\nMoreover, the first ALJ did not restrict claimant’s functional\n\nlimitations    to   any        specific    time     --    e.g.,    when    claimant         was\n\nhospitalized or about to be hospitalized.                       Nor, since the tape of\n\nthe first hearing has been lost, is there any evidence that Dr.\n\nRuggiano so restricted his opinions.                     As a result, and resolving\n\nall reasonable doubt in claimant’s favor as we must, see SSR 91-5p,\n\nwe assume that the first ALJ implicitly had found that claimant\n\ngenerally had experienced such limitations, including when he was\n\noutside of the hospital.\n\n           In light of this, the fact that claimant had not been in\n\nthe hospital in September 1975 or July 1978 cannot support the\n\ninference that his psychotic disorder thus did not prevent him from\n\nbeing   able   to   process          timely    appeals     at    those     times.          Also\n\ninadequate to support such inference is the Commissioner’s citation\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\fto   isolated     statements     in   the    25-page    treatment   record   of\n\nclaimant’s      in-patient     hospitalizations,       which   statements    say\n\nnothing specific about claimant’s state of mind during the relevant\n\ntimes.      Last, and assuming that claimant had filed the 1978\n\napplication on his own, we do not think that this fact, standing\n\nalone, constitutes substantial evidence to support the conclusion\n\nthat claimant possessed the ability to appeal from the denial of\n\nthat application.

See id. at 37.   Given this, and given\n\nthe flawed findings in the second ALJ’s decision, we are of the\n\nview that such records, which might reveal information about\n\nclaimant’s functioning at the relevant times, should be reviewed.\n\nAs such, we conclude that a remand is required.\n\n           The judgment of the district court therefore is vacated,\n\nand the case is remanded to that court with instructions to remand\n\nto the Commissioner for further proceedings in accordance with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f</pre>",
